Ziwaformerly Van Niekerk ruins after Major Pompey Van Niekerk who was second in command of the Afrikaner Corps is an archaeological site in Nyanga District, Zimbabwe, containing the remains of a vast late Iron Age agricultural settlement dated to the 15th century. Ziwa was declared a National Monument in 1946 and is currently under consideration for World Heritage listing. The site contains a large variety of stonework structures including stone terraces running along contours of hills and steep landscapes. Archaeological investigations have also uncovered important aspects of pottery and rock art. Before the declaration of the site as a National Monument, Ziwa had been part of the commercial farms area and was thus under private ownership. A great deal of damage or degradation of antiquities may have been wrought during this period as the farmer used the property as a cattle ranch. Currently a site museum (with tourist facilities such as camping, guided tours, walking trails, bird viewing, etc.) has been established to represent the Ziwa heritage and other archaeological sites in the Nyanga district. Despite the abandonment of the site by its inhabitants in the 18th Century, Ziwa continued to be of significance to the later communities that settled in its neighbourhood. Description Ziwa bears evidence of human occupation for all the major archaeological periods identified in Zimbabwe's archaeological sequence. That is from hunter-gatherer periods of the Stone Age to historical times. The of land comprise: Stone Age deposits, rock art sites, early farming communities settlements, a landscape of later farming communities marked by terraces and field systems, hill forts, pit structures and stone enclosures, iron smelting and forging furnaces and numerous remains of daub-plastered housing structures.

(photo 2009) Involuntary park is a neologism coined by science fiction author and environmentalist Bruce Sterling to describe previously inhabited areas that for environmental, economic, or political reasons have, in Sterling's words, \\"lost their value for technological instrumentalism\\" and been allowed to return to an overgrown, feral state. Origin of the term Discussing involuntary parks in the context of rising sea levels due to global warming, Sterling writes: While Sterling's original vision of an involuntary park was of places abandoned due to collapse of economy or rising sea-level, the term has come to be used on any land where human inhabitation or use for one reason or other has been stopped, including military exclusion zones, minefields and areas considered dangerous due to pollution.Cascio, J. (2005): The Green Ribbon , from WorldchangingFor an example of the term used with land-mines, see Landmines and Involuntary parks Existing examples zone of alienation around Chernobyl. Abandoned human settlements and developments overtaken by foliage and wild animals are known to exist in numerous locations around the world. Ghost towns, disused railways, mines, and airfields, or areas experiencing urban decay or deindustrialization may be subject to a resurgence in ecological proliferation as human presence is reduced. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has seen the return of previously extirpated indigenous species such as boars, wolves, and bears, as well as a thriving herd of re-introduced Przewalski's Horses.Wildlife defies Chernobyl radiation, by Stefen Mulvey, BBC News While wildlife flourishes in the least affected areas, tumors, infertility and lower brain weight are reported in many small animals (including mice and birds) living in areas subject to severe contamination. The former Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Denver was abandoned for years due to contamination from production of chemical weapons, yet the wildlife returned and the site was eventually turned into a wildlife refugium. Involuntary parks where human presence is severely limited can host animal species that are otherwise extremely threatened in their range. The Korean Demilitarized Zone is thought to house not only Korean tigers, but also the critically endangered Amur leopard. While the above examples may be considered involuntary parks, Sterling's dystopian vision of an \\"unnatural\\" ecology has yet to be observed. In most observed cases, existing involuntary parks are characterized by a restoration of the pre-human ecological order, as opposed to the novel environment theorized by Sterling. When an involuntary park develops in an urban or formerly urban location, it may become the target of urban exploration. Further examples include: * The Cattle island in the flood pond of Hirakud Dam * The Green Line in Cyprus. * The Frontier Closed Area in Hong Kong. * The White Sands Missile Range U.S. government military reservation. Location of the Trinity test site. * The stringent military control of the Iron Curtain has left a large green corridor across Europe. An initiative is underway to protect this former involuntary wilderness as a European Green Belt. * The waterfront of Hilo, Hawaii was stricken by two devastating tsunami, and the strip was abandoned and made into parkland. * The land formerly occupied by a residential area in Anchorage, Alaska was cracked and disfigured beyond usefulness by the Good Friday earthquake, and was converted into a park named Earthquake Park. * The neighbourhood that formerly surrounded Love Canal. * The former U.S. navy areas of Vieques, Puerto Rico. * Abandoned fishing villages preserved on Gouqi Island, Zhoushan Islands in China. * Montebello Islands, Australia, site of nuclear tests. * Times Beach, Missouri, a town evacuated and dismantled due to dioxin contamination, now the site of Route 66 State Park. * The Ecological Reserve (Reserva Ecol√≥gica) in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, formed by a land-fill of waste material of demolished buildings dumped in the river off Costanera Sud avenue. Over time, sand and sediment began to build up and developed itself into a biodiversity sample of the native Llanura Pampeana ecosystem. * Parts of the Eifel National Park are closed to the public because of mines planted during the Second World War. * Red House, New York and Elko, New York, seized by the state of New York in the mid-20th century for several public works projects, including Allegany State Park, the Allegheny Reservoir and the Southern Tier Expressway. Much of the land was eventually converted to \\"voluntary\\" (official) parks, though areas of the Allegany Indian Reservation (particularly portions of former New York State Route 17) have been closed off and left to nature. * Centralia, Pennsylvania, a town abandoned due to a coal mine fire. * The Hanford Reach National Monument, the former buffer zone around the Hanford Site which produced plutonium for nuclear bombs. * Declared Red Zones as a result of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. * Ujung Kulon National Park in Java formed itself on farmland devastated and depopulated by the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa; it is now a maintained national park. * The VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Nature Park in Bucharest, Romania. * Many urban and rural parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Kosovo, due to unexploded ordnance. * Old Town Negaunee, Michigan; a portion of the town abandoned after being undermined by local iron ore mining. * Parts of the Iron Curtain that divided Germany during the Cold War have never been cleared of landmines, resulting in said areas being closed off to the public, allowing wildlife to flourish.

The book has been described as a \\"spiritual autobiography\\" where Jefferies idealises the English countryside as a sort of utopia. The book and its themes have been compared to the transcendentalist movement. Other Transcendentalist themes concerning rapturous union with Nature can be found in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Thoreau, and John Muir. The scholar Roger Ebbatson considers that the book's \\"speculative\\" spiritualism is emblematic of the decline of Christian belief in the more empirical Victorian era. The French writer Alexis de Tocqueville explicitly warned against too strong an identification with nature, describing it as \\"pantheism\\" and a departure from Christianity. Indeed, Christianity has always had a vexed relationship with those who worship nature: is it right and proper to preserve and adulate God's natural creation or better to subjugate, control and exploit it?  Reception  Critical reaction to the book was mixed.

As of the , it had a population of 635. The name, Wycheproof, originates from an aboriginal word meaning 'grass on a hill', referring to Mount Wycheproof just off the Calder Highway, which is the smallest registered mountain in the world, standing at above sea level or above the surrounding plains. The economy of Wycheproof is driven mainly by wheat. The railway from Bendigo and Korong Vale reached the area in 1883 and was later extended north. The township was established beside the railway and the Post Office opened on 1 April 1884 replacing earlier offices from 1876 serving the rural area named Wycheproof (renamed to Moffat) and Mount Wycheproof. The last regular passenger service though the local railway station was from Bendigo to Sea Lake on 7 May 1977 and was operated by a Diesel Electric railmotor. The town is unusual in that even today the railway line runs in the centre of the main street. The Wycheproof Magistrates' Court, based in the historic Wycheproof Court House, closed on 1 January 1983. In an attempt to attract new residents, the local community has developed a project to offer otherwise vacant farmhouses for rent at A$1 per week. Expressions of interest in the scheme have been heard from Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and Ireland as well as most parts of Australia. The project was inspired by a similar program at Cumnock, New South Wales. Wycheproof has a proud sporting history. With its neighbouring township Narraport, Wycheproof has an Australian rules football team (Wycheproof- Narraport) competing in the North Central Football League. Many AFL stars are from Wycheproof including Corey Jones, Mervyn Keane, Greg Kennedy and Chris Pym. Wycheproof has a horse racing club, the Mt Wycheproof & District Racing Club, whose one meeting a year is the Mount Wycheproof Cup meeting held on Victoria Derby day in late October or early November. Golfers play at the course of the Wycheproof Golf Club on the Calder Highway. Notable people * Wycheproof is the birthplace of Peta Credlin, who was Chief of Staff for Tony Abbott, former Prime Minister and former leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. * VFL footballer Greg Kennedy is from the Wycheproof district and recruited by Carlton from Eaglehawk Football Club/Wycheproof.

This class consists of two groups of objects: protostars and pre-main-sequence stars. Classification by spectral energy distribution A star forms by accumulation of material that falls in to a protostar from a circumstellar disk or envelope. Material in the disk is cooler than the surface of the protostar, so it radiates at longer wavelengths of light producing excess infrared emission. As material in the disk is depleted, the infrared excess decreases. Thus, YSOs are usually classified into evolutionary stages based on the slope of their spectral energy distribution in the mid-infrared, using a scheme introduced by Lada (1987). He proposed three classes (I, II and III), based on the values of intervals of spectral index \\\\alpha \\\\,: \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{d\\\\log(\\\\lambda F_\\\\lambda)}{d\\\\log(\\\\lambda)}. Here \\\\lambda \\\\, is wavelength, and F_\\\\lambda is flux density. The \\\\alpha \\\\, is calculated in the wavelength interval of 2.2‚Äì20 {\\\\mu}m (near- and mid-infrared region). Andre et al. (1993) discovered a class 0: objects with strong submillimeter emission, but very faint at {\\\\lambda}<10{\\\\mu}m. Greene et al. (1994) added a fifth class of \\"flat spectrum\\" sources. *Class 0 sources ‚Äì undetectable at {\\\\lambda}<20{\\\\mu}m *Class I sources have {\\\\alpha}>0.3 *Flat spectrum sources have 0.3>{\\\\alpha}>-0.3 *Class II sources have -0.3>{\\\\alpha}>-1.6 *Class III sources have {\\\\alpha}<-1.6 This classification schema roughly reflects evolutionary sequence. It is believed that most deeply embedded Class 0 sources evolve towards Class I stage, dissipating their circumstellar envelopes. Eventually they become optically visible on the stellar birthline as pre-main-sequence stars. Class II objects have circumstellar disks and correspond roughly to classical T Tauri stars, while Class III stars have lost their disks and correspond approximately to weak-line T Tauri stars. An intermediate stage where disks can only be detected at longer wavelengths (e.g., at 24{\\\\mu}m) are known as transition-disk objects. Characteristics YSOs are also associated with early star evolution phenomena: jets and bipolar outflows, masers, Herbig‚ÄìHaro objects, and protoplanetary disks (circumstellar disks or proplyds). Classification of YSOs by mass These stars may be differentiated by mass: Massive YSOs, intermediate-mass YSOs, and brown dwarfs.

His earliest concerns were with natural history and botany and his numismatic collection, but he became one of the small group forming the first architectural historians in France. Biography His early studies were at the college of Coutances, followed by studies in the law at Caen. With the outbreak of the French Revolution, he joined other aristocratic emigr√©s, travelled in England and fought in the First Coalition or \\"Army of the Princes\\" and did not return until 1801, when he settled once again on his family estates at Gerville in Normandy and devoted his leisure to pursuing the local history of the Cotentin, from an antiquarian point of view. In 1811 he moved to Valognes (Manche), pursuing botanical field research and the nascent field of geology, and searching out ancient written materials that cast light on local history, while he undertook, from 1814 onwards, to compile a pioneering inventory of some four or five hundred churches of La Manche (Noell 2005); some of these materials were published as Voyage arch√©ologique dans la Manche (1818‚Äì1820).The work was edited and republished by Dr. Michel Guibert, (St.-L√¥ 1999‚Äì2002). He and his fellow members in the Soci√©t√© des Antiquaires de Normandie, founded in 1824‚Äî the abb√© Gervais de la Rue in Rouen, Auguste Le Pr√©vost and Arcisse de Caumont‚Äî virtually formed a \\"travelling school of architectural connoisseurship\\" (Noell). In 1818 Duh√©rissier de Gerville used the expression ‚Äò'romane‚Äô'‚Äî though in the sense of Romance languages\\"Romanik: Definition\\".‚Äî in a letter to Auguste Le Pr√©vost; Gerville's friend Arcisse de Caumont is more correctly accorded the honour of publicly applying, in French, the label Romane, i.e. \\"Romanesque\\" style to architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, in his Essaie sur l'architecture du moyen √¢ge, particuli√®rement en Normandie, 1824.Noted by Elizabeth Williams, in \\"The perception of Romanesque art in the Romantic period: Archeological attitudes in France in the 1820s and 1830s\\", Forum for Modern Language Studies, 1985 XXI(4) pp 303-321. In fact the OED cites first uses in English of 1715 about the languages, and 1819 about the architectural style. It was a more inclusive, European term for the massive round-arched style that had been recognized in Norman work in England, where the term \\"Norman architecture\\" was first used in 1817 by the antiquarian Thomas Rickman, in his published essay An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation: English architectural historians long retained the term \\"Norman\\" for that version of the Romanesque. Duh√©rissier de Gerville was a correspondent of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. He encouraged a local man of Valognes, L√©opold Victor Delisle by engaging him to copy manuscripts in his collection, and taught him enough of the basics of paleography that he was able to gain entrance to the √âcole des Chartres in 1846, and pursue a distinguished scholarly career at the Biblioth√®que nationale; he was a member of the general council for the d√©partement of La Manche, but withdrew at the time of the Revolution of 1830 and, a confirmed legitimist like others of the Antiquaires de la Normandie, refused the cross of the L√©gion d'honneur offered him under Louis Philippe. Gerville published papers and antiquarian notes on the towns and Roman roads of the Cotentin peninsula, on Merovingian studies, and on Mont-Saint-Michel, which were collected as √âtudes g√©ographiques et historiques sur le d√©partement de la Manche, (Cherbourg 1854). Part of his rich collection of manuscripts he bequeathed to the archives of La Manche, and part to his prot√©g√© L√©opold Delisle. Duh√©rissier de Gerville is very likely to have been intended as the person honoured in the gastropod name Mitrella gervillii (Payraudeau 1826).Biographical Etymology of Marine Organism Names. G The Devonian coral Calceola gervillei (now known to belong to the genus Rhizophyllum) was similarly very likely to have named for him by Bayle (1878) although Bayle's material was collected by de VerneuilBAYLE, E., 1878.

It was first published in 1940 as a short story in The Saturday Evening Post, after which he expanded it to create a short novella which was published on 7 April 1941.  Plot summary  The Snow Goose is a simple, short written parable on the regenerative power of friendship and love, set against a backdrop of the horror of war. It documents the growth of a friendship between Philip Rhayader, an artist living a solitary life in an abandoned lighthouse in the marshlands of Essex because of his disabilities, and a young local girl, Fritha. The snow goose, symbolic of both Rhayader (Gallico) and the world itself, wounded by gunshot and many miles from home, is found by Fritha and, as the human friendship blossoms, the bird is nursed back to flight, and revisits the lighthouse in its migration for several years. As Fritha grows up, Rhayader and his small sailboat eventually are lost in the Dunkirk evacuation, having saved several hundred men. The bird, which was with Rhayader, returns briefly to the grown Fritha on the marshes. She interprets this as Rhayader's soul taking farewell of her (and realizes she had come to love him). Afterwards, a German pilot destroys Rhayader's lighthouse and all of his work, except for one portrait Fritha saves after his death: a painting of her as Rhayader first saw her ‚Äî a child, with the wounded snow goose in her arms. Reception The Snow Goose was one of the O. Henry Prize Winners in 1941.O'Henry Award Winners Critic Robert van Gelder called it \\"perhaps the most sentimental story that ever has achieved the dignity of a Borzoi [prestige imprint of publisher Knopf] imprint. It is a timeless legend that makes use of every timeless appeal that could be crowded into it\\". A public library put it on a list of 'tearjerkers'. Gallico made no apologies, saying that in the contest between sentiment and 'slime', \\"sentiment remains so far out in front, as it always has and always will among ordinary humans that the calamity-howlers and porn merchants have to increase the decibels of their lamentations, the hideousness of their violence and the mountainous piles of their filth to keep in the race at all.\\"Allardice, Lisa. \\"Winter reads: The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico\\", The Guardian, December 19, 2011 Popular culture * In 1944, Ronald Colman read The Snow Goose on Silver Theater on CBS radio (April 30, 1944). * In 1948, a spoken word recording featuring Herbert Marshall, with music by Victor Young was issued on Decca records. * In 1971, The Snow Goose, directed by Patrick Garland, was broadcast on BBC television.

Musical adaptation  In 1975, the British progressive rock group Camel made an orchestrated instrumental album based on Gallico's novel, initially entitled The Snow Goose. Gallico threatened to sue the band for copyright infringement, and therefore the band had to change the title to Music Inspired by The Snow Goose. The album itself was a great success and established Camel as a successful group, leading to a sell-out performance with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall, London, in October 1975, which was later released as part of their first concert album A Live Record. Camel toured Europe in late 2013 and early 2014, performing the album in its entirety for the first time since 1975. In 2014, readers of Prog magazine voted it no. 31 in the Top 100 Prog Albums of All Time. In 1976, RCA released an album with music written and orchestrated by Ed Welch and Spike Milligan. Contributions were made by Harry Edgington and Alan Clare. The album was produced by Welch and Stuart Taylor for Quarry Productions Ltd, with artistic direction from Milligan. Gallico's original story was adapted for this recording by Milligan in Australia in 1976. The music is published by Clowns Music Ltd. Milligan provided the narration throughout.

Some contend that the killings were not planned, but were unorganised vendettas of individuals during the post-war chaos, or that those considered victims of execution instead died in battle against the Partisans. The exact number of victims remains controversial, as the investigation is ongoing.Report on the stage of investigation, year 2011 (in Serbian)Agenda of the round-table held in Belgrade, 2015 (in Serbian) There are different estimates regarding the number of victims. According to one source, at least 80,000 people were executed in the whole of Serbia, while another source states that the number of victims was more than 100,000. The names of about 4,000 individual Germans who were killed by the Partisans are known, but it is estimated that many more ethnic Germans were executed.Ulrich Merten: Forgotten Voices: The Expulsion of the Germans from Eastern Europe After World War II, Transactions Publisher, New Jersey, USA, 2012 These events during the fall of 1944 are referred to as \\"bloody autumn\\" by some sources.Kathryn Schaeffer Pabst, Douglas Schaeffer Pabst: Taken: A Lament for a Lost Ethnicity, iUniverse Books, 2006 Georg Wildmann, Hans Sonnleitner, Karl Weber: Genocide of the ethnic Germans in Yugoslavia, 1944‚Äì1948, Danube Swabian Association of the USA, 2001 In 2009, the government of Serbia formed a State Commission to investigate the secret burial places of victims after 12 September 1944. The Commission compiled a registry of names, basic biographical data, and details of persecution. The registry contains a total of 55,973 names, including 27,367 Germans, 14,567 Serbs and 6,112 Hungarians.State Commission Registry, accessed on 22 June 2014  Background  During World War II, in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Yugoslavia. Central Serbia was put under Military Administration in Serbia. Kosovo was attached to Italian protectorate of Albania, while eastern part of Serbia was occupied by Bulgaria. The Vojvodina region was divided into three occupation zones: Banat was placed under direct German control as an autonomous region within the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia, Baƒçka was attached back to Horthy's Hungary and Syrmia was attached to the Independent State of Croatia. Axis had big problem to quell down partisan uprising led by Communist Party of Yugoslavia due to man shortage and rough terrain. Therefore, they heavily relied on auxiliary anticommunist forces drawn from various Yugoslav people. In Serbia they used Serbian Volunteer Corps, Serbian State Guard, and Chetniks of Kosta Peƒáanac and Dragoljub Mihailoviƒá. From ranks of German minority in Banat, Germany organized 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen. Also some Hungarians in Baƒçka and Baranja joined Turan Hunters. From ranks of White Russian emigres, Germany recruited Russian Protective Corps. Aside from military and paramilitary formations, many national organizations that weren't fascist or irendetist in its roots (such as German Kulturbund or DMKSZ (, )) also showed support to occupying armies. Since the beginning of the occupation, the occupying powers committed numerous war crimes against the civilian population of the region, especially against Serbs, Jews and Roma.Zvonimir Goluboviƒá, Racija u Ju≈ænoj Baƒçkoj, 1942. godine, Novi Sad, 1991. Therefore, many citizens of Yugoslavia belonging to all ethnic groups joined the partisan resistance movement to fight against occupation.Milorad Grujiƒá, Vodiƒç kroz Novi Sad i okolinu, Novi Sad, 2004. The victims of the Axis troops were mostly civilians, while some were the fighters of the partisan resistance movement.Slobodan ƒÜurƒçiƒá, Broj stanovnika Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 1996. Vojvodina was a region with ethnically mixed population according to the various official censuses. In their struggle against Axis forces, partisans viewed Chetniks as misled and continuously called them to surrender. Similar policy was conducted toward members of Croatian Home Guard. Those who did surrender were included in partisan ranks or were given amnesty. On 17 August 1944, Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the general amnesty for Chetniks and members of Croatian Home Guardson condition that they did not commit any crimes and join Partisans until 15 September 1944 as deadline. Members of voluntary anticommunist and quisling formations (Serbian Volunteer Corps, Ustashe Militia and Russian Protective Corps) were excluded from the offer. This amnesty, as well as proclamation of king Peter II of 12 September 1944, that all armed formations should place under the command of Marshal Tito, led to a great drop in the ranks of the Chetnik and the Croatian Home Guard. According to Tito's order, former Chetniks and Home Guards, who, even after 15 September 1944, would cross over to the partisans would be deployed in the partisan units. Amnesty was again proclaimed on 21 November 1944, and again by the adoption of the Amnesty and Pardoning Act of 6 July 1945. Between 10 and 15 thousand Chetniks were amnestied in this way, which accounted for about a third to a half of Chetniks in Serbia at that time. Central Serbia The number of victims in Central Serbia is estimated at 30,000. According to Milovan ƒêilas, before communist forces entered Belgrade, their leaders decided that followers of Serbia's former pro-Axis puppet Government of National Salvation should be liquidated immediately. According to communist leaders, Belgrade was the main center of Serbian reaction and, due to that, it was designed to be \\"very carefully cleansed from anti-communist elements\\". The establishment of communist administration was, therefore, followed by a brutal showdown with notable persons that participated in the cultural, political and public life of the German-occupied territory of Serbia, and also with members of the rival Chetnik resistance movement who were defeated in a civil war. Vojvodina Military administration in Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja (1944‚Äì1945) In Vojvodina (which then included Baƒçka, Banat, Baranja and Syrmia regions), most of the executions were performed during Military Administration in Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja, between October 1944 and January 1945.  Background  At the end of 1944, Axis troops were defeated by the Red Army and the whole of Vojvodina came under the control of the Yugoslav partisan forces. On 17 October 1944, by the order of Josip Broz Tito, the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja regions were placed under military administration. About the establishment of this military government, Josip Broz Tito said the following: \\"The liberation of Baƒçka, Banat and Baranja requires the quickest possible return to normal life and the establishment of the people's democratic power in these territories. The specific circumstances under which these territories had to live during the occupation, and a mission to fully avert all adversities inflicted to our people by the occupying forces and foreign ethnic elements colonized here, requires that, in the beginning, we concentrate all power in order to mobilize the economy and carry on the war of liberation more successfully\\".Jelena Popov, Vojvodina i Srbija, Veternik, 2001. The partisan troops in Baƒçka had a very strict order, they had to \\"show the strongest possible determination against fifth columnists, especially against Germans and Hungarians\\". The term \\"fifth column\\" is applied to the subversive and resistant forces and organizations left behind by a retreating enemy. The National Committee for People's Liberation and the Red Army had agreed on the necessary cooperation in due time. Brigadier General Ivan Rukavina was appointed commander of the military administration. He was in constant and direct contact with Tito, the supreme commander. In his first decree, he ordered his troops to \\"protect the national future and the South Slavic character of the territories\\" . In the 28 October 1944 issue of Slobodna Vojvodina, the newspaper of the People's Liberation Front in Vojvodina, one member of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia summarized the intentions suggested from above, with the obvious aim to raise spirit for revenge by exaggerations and distortions: > Although we destroyed the occupying German and Hungarian hordes and drove > them back to the west, we have not yet eradicated the roots of the poisonous > weeds planted by them... The hundreds of thousands of foreigners who were > settled on the territories where our ancestors had cleared the forests, > drained the swamps, and created the conditions necessary for civilized life. > These foreigners still kept shooting at our soldiers and the Soviet soldiers > from the dark. They do everything they can to prevent the return to normal > life, preparing, in the midst of this difficult situation, to stab us in the > back again at the appropriate moment... The people feel that determined, > energetic steps are needed to ensure the Yugoslav character of Baƒçka.  Ethnic composition of victims  Germans (Danube Swabians) The estimated number range of Germans victims in Vojvodina is between 17,000 and 59,335.Dieter Blumenwitz, Rechtsgutachten √ºber die Verbrechen an den Deutschen in Jugoslawien 1944‚Äì1948, Sonderausgabe: Juristische Studien, M√ºnchen 2002, S. 64. According to Friedrich Binder, the total number of the German victims in Yugoslavia was 56,736, of which 240 died while escaping in October 1944, 8,049 were executed by the Yugoslav partisans and 48,447 died in prison camps from starvation, illness and in the coldness.Nenad Stefanoviƒá, Jedan svet na Dunavu, Beograd, 2003, page 133. Serbian State commission formed in 2009 established the list of 27.367 German victims in total. Before World War II, the German population of Vojvodina numbered about 350,000 people.

As a consequence of the World War II events in Yugoslavia, the collaboration with Nazi forces and committed war crimes of the German community Marie‚ÄìJanine Calic: Geschichte Jugoslawiens im 20.

Between 1944 and 1946, a prison camp system was established for all Vojvodina citizens of German origin in almost all settlements where they lived (see also: List of concentration and internment camps, Yugoslavia). In those camps, ethnic Germans were used as slave labor, they were tortured, beaten, and left to die from preventable illnesses and starvation. Some members of the German community were executed by Yugoslav Partisans in those camps. Yugoslav Partisans handed over some of the ethnic Germans to Soviet Red Army, who then took them to Siberia and used them for work in mines as slave labor. Some members of ethnic Germans of Vojvodina were expelled to Germany or Austria. File:Gakovo Memorial1.jpg|The German victims' memorial in Gakovo.

Serbs After king Peter's speech via BBC on 12 September 1944, those Chetniks who didn't join Partisans became effectively outlaws. In time of the king's speech, Chetniks and Partisans were engaged in Battle of Jelova Gora, which ended with serious Chetnik defeat. Mihailoviƒá with his party fled to Bosnia, while smaller Chetnik groups remained in Serbia, hoping that Red Army would accept them as allies. When this did not materialize, those groups, joined by former Serbian State Guard, began retreat toward Bosnia through Sand≈æak, on flanks of retreating German Army Group E from Greece. On their route through Sand≈æak, Chetniks and Germans were harassed by Partisans and air raids from Allied Balkan Air Force. The number of the Serb victims in Vojvodina is estimated at about 23,000‚Äì24,000 (According to the professor Dragoljub ≈Ωivkoviƒá, 47,000 ethnic Serbs were killed in Vojvodina between 1941 and 1948. About half of the Serb victims were killed by occupational forces and the other half of them were executed by post-war communist authorities). In 1944, in Rajina ≈†uma near Novi Sad, partisans executed about 200‚Äì250 Serbs, who were accused that they sympathized with the Chetnik movement of Dra≈æa Mihajloviƒá. They were buried into two mass graves, which were discovered in 1991 during communal works in that area. After the entry of partisan forces into Novi Sad on 23 October 1944, by the order of general Josip Rukavina (who was a commandant of military area of Baƒçka and Baranja), mass arrests of respectable Serbs had begun. They mostly were reputable and rich householders, industrialists and intellectuals, who were seen as a possible threat for the new communist authorities. Order was carried out by the 11th Vojvodinian people's liberation brigade and most of the arrested citizens were executed until the middle of November. Citizens who were executed included dr Milo≈° Petroviƒá (former mayor), dr Obrad Milutinoviƒá (doctor and vice-president of Novi Sad municipality), Dragoljub Ristiƒá (an industrialist), Pavle Tatiƒá (one of the founders of Socialist Party in Novi Sad), Vojislav Matiƒá (editor and publisher of \\"Nova Po≈°ta\\" magazine in Serbian language), Milo≈° Kostiƒá (footballer of FK Vojvodina), Svetislav Vilovski and ƒêurica Vlaoviƒá (members of Serbian Soko society), Milan ‚Äì Peca Popoviƒá (intellectual and member of Rotary club), Jovan Begoviƒá (provincial clerk), Aleksandar Silber (economist), Pera Saviƒá (journalist), Fedor Radiƒá (doctor), and Gaja Graƒçanin (director of \\"Putnik\\" agency). Especially tragic fate is that of pre-war mayor dr Milo≈° Petroviƒá, who was creditable for elevation of monument dedicated to Svetozar Miletiƒá that still stands in the centre of Novi Sad, and who also helped in saving lives of hundreds of Serbs who were imprisoned in concentration camp \\"≈†arvar\\" during Hungarian occupation. State commission formed in 2009 after thorough investigation made a list of all victims, available on its official site. List includes a total of 14.567 Serb victims. 917 of them are from Vojvodina, and further 101 from Zemun.State Commission Registry, accessed on 22 June 2014 Hungarians The Hungarian victims' memorial in Subotica cemetery, elevated for the 50th anniversary of the executions (1994). Behind: names of victims. The Hungarian victims' monument in ƒåurug, shown here damaged. Various sources provide very different numbers of Hungarians executed in Vojvodina at that time. \\"The Book of Evidence of Killed War Criminals in 1944/1945\\" published in Yugoslavia states that a total of 1,686 people were executed in Baƒçka of which approximately 1,000 people were presumed to be Hungarians. However, the estimation of historian Kasa≈° tells 5,000 executed Hungarians. According to other estimations, the number range of the executed Hungarians in Vojvodina may be between 40,000Dimitrije Boarov, Politiƒçka istorija Vojvodine, Novi Sad, 2001. and 50,000. Some sources claim that the most probable number of the executed Hungarians in Vojvodina was between 20,000 and 25,000,Dragomir Jankov, Vojvodina ‚Äì propadanje jednog regiona, Novi Sad, 2004. while others claim that it is about 35,000 (Cseres Tibor gives an exact estimate of 34,491 executed people). Some Hungarian houses were sacked and a number of Hungarian civilians were executed and tortured.Kasa≈°, Aleksandar: Maƒëari u Vojvodini 1941‚Äì1946. (Novi Sad, 1996) Filozofski fakultet u Novom Sadu, Odsek za istoriju. Some women and children were raped.Kasa≈°, Aleksandar: Maƒëari u Vojvodini 1941‚Äì1946. (Novi Sad, 1996) Some men who were able to work were deported to Siberia.Karapand≈æiƒá, Borivoje: Jugoslovensko krvavo proleƒáe 1945. Titovi Katini i Gulagi. (Beograd 1990: Mladost). People of Hungarian nationality are third in terms of the number of dead after the liberation, according to the 2014 data from Serbian state commission. In 2014 there were 6,112 registered persons (with 300 potential duplicate names), of which 589 are alleged to have disappeared (some of whom possibly fled to Hungary)Here the otherwise relevant article makes a biased statement, supposition not backed with proof. Here is the direct translation of the sentence from the source: \\"6.112 persons of hungarian nationality are evidented (11,03 percent) in the register, while this number includes about 300 duplicate names. For the 4.679 Hungarians it is declared they were murdered (586 \\"shot\\", 4.438 \\"liquidated\\", 7 \\"hanged\\"). For 589 Hungarians it is said that they \\"disappeared\\", in which number may be included a certain number of Vojvodina hungarians who escaped, and moved from the territory of Baƒçka before the days of liberation.\\" and 279 died in camps. Unlike in Banat, in Baƒçka there were drastic punishment of members of the Hungarian national minority, especially those found, often on the basis of witness statements, that took direct or indirect involvement in the January 1942 raid and in the suffering of the Serbian population in April 1941. Members of Arrow Cross Party were especially targeted, as well as members of collaborationist apparatus, leadership of the DMKSZ (Cultural Union of the Hungarians of the Southern Territories that was also proclaimed to be a fascist organization), but also and others that were considered to fall under the category of associates of the occupiers. The largest number of people of Hungarian ethnicity died after the liberation of Vojvodina was recorded in places where, during the occupation, the Hungarian army and local Hungarians participated in mass crimes against the Serbian, Jewish and Roma population. The largest number of Hungarians killed was recorded in the region of ≈†ajka≈°ka (towns ≈Ωabalj, ƒåurug and Mo≈°orin), which were affected by the January 1942 raid. The attitude towards the Hungarians began to change from November 1944. The military administration of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja warned that in some cases, especially in Baƒçka, mistakes were made and that the treatment of Germans was better than the Hungarians. In its instructions, it is pointed out that only those Hungarians who committed or incited crimes against the Slovene population were to be detained in the camps, and that Hungarians who did not fall into the category of war criminals should be released from camps. These guidelines are not accepted in all places with approval, especially in the ≈†ajka≈°ka region. In January and February 1945, some residents of ƒåurug and Mo≈°orin demanded that all Germans and Hungarians should move out of these places, because their co-existence is impossible after events during the war. Almost the entire Hungarian population of ≈†ajka≈°ka was expelled and the largest number of detained in camps in Baƒçki Jarak, Gajdobra and Mladenovo. Part was sent to Srem as a labor force in the preparation of the partisans for the breakthrough of the Syrmian Front and in repairing of the Belgrade-Zagreb railway. People detained in Baƒçki Jarak were used as labor force for agricultural works. According to the book of the deceased from January to May 1945, due to poor conditions in the camp (maltreatment, hunger and disease), 66 adults and 55 children from the age of one month to 18 years have died. Nevertheless, the Hungarian population was accepted into partisans ranks. At the time of these events, the 15th Vojvodina Shock Brigade \\"S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi\\" was formed from the Hungarians from area of Baƒçka Topola and Sombor. About ten thousand of Vojvodina Hungarians took part in the final operations for the liberation of Yugoslavia. Rusyns Some members of Rusyn (Ruthenian) population in ƒêurƒëevo were also targeted by partisan forces in 1944. According to Hungarian author Cseres, the majority of the Hungarian population of this village left with the retreating Hungarian army. The Yugoslav partisans then established control over this village and took their reprisals out on the Rusyns and Serbs who were sympathetic towards the Hungarians, the Serbian Royal Government or for their religious views. Several hundred Rusyns were executed and some prominent figures tortured. Serbian State commission formed in 2009 established the list of 40 Rusyn victims in total. Aftermath In June 2013, members of the Serbian Parliament adopted a declaration, which condemned the massacres and application of the principle of collective guilt against Hungarians in Vojvodina at the end of the Second World War. In response, Hungarian President J√°nos √Åder apologised in Belgrade for the war crimes committed against civilian Serbs and Jewish people during the Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories.  The history of investigations  I. The Federal Commission (\\"Dr≈æavna komisija\\") ‚Äì 1943 Even in the midst of the storm of the war, at the second session of the AVNOJ in Jajce, November 1943, a decision was made for a special task force to be formed to investigate the crimes committed by fascists at the territory of Yugoslavia during the war. It was named \\"Federal Commission for determination of the crimes conducted by the Occupators and their helpers during World War 2\\" (in Serbian: Dr≈æavna komisija za utvrƒëivanje zloƒçina okupatora i njihovih pomagaƒça iz Drugog svetskog rata), and it immediately started its work. In following five years broad investigation was conducted nationwide. It is said that until 1948, this official body collected over a million cases of war crime, documented and reported. This investigation was very extensive, because the newly formed government wanted to collect the best possible set of data that can be presented in a demand for war reparations from Germany (both East and West), Italy, Bulgaria and Hungary ‚Äì countries responsible for the attack on Yugoslavia and violation of its sovereignty. Although this nationwide program concentrated only on the victims of fascism (and rarely on the civilian innocent victims of communist reprisal), it plays an important part in the completing of the historical picture. Even though the assessment of its results, and its methodology for collecting data (mainly through civil reports of cases) would be different today, the work of this Commission is very important to the reconstruction of events, especially those that followed shortly after the war. II. The Surveying Committee (\\"Anketni odbor\\") ‚Äì 2001 The first extensive study, and also the first ever attempt to systematically analize the events that occurred between 1941 and 1948 on the territory of Serbia happened in 2001 on the initiative of the Assembly of the Autonomous province of Vojvodina (Skup≈°tina Autonomne pokrajine Vojvodine). On 22 January 2001 in the building of the Assembly in Novi Sad, this governmental department formed a specialist group with a long name \\"Surveying Committee for investigation of the truth on the events that took place between 1941. until 1945. in Vojvodina\\" (Anketni odbor za utvrƒëivanje istine o dogaƒëajima u periodu od 1941. do 1945. godine u Vojvodini) and this institution became a formal body of the Assembly of Autonomous province of Vojvodina.Tibor Pal (2010): Na putu istine. O radu Pokrajinskog anketnog odbora za utvrƒëivanje istine o dogaƒëajima u periodu od 1941. do 1948. godine. This should be considered the first modern official investigation that took place after the Second World War, except for some studies done earlier in Slovenia. (There was also a Commission after the war, but it dealt only with the victims of 1941‚Äì1944.The \\"Federal Commission for determination of the crimes conducted by the Occupators and their helpers during World War 2\\" formed 1943. in Jajce and worked until 1948.) III. The Vojvodina Academy (\\"VANU\\") ‚Äì 2004 The work of the Assembly Committee was three years later taken over by Vojvodinian Academy of Sciences and Arts (VANU), where it was in a great deal extended. The Academy expanded the research for the period up to 1948, and to some extent even to 1952. Through their work an unbeliavable amount of 10 volumes with over 4000 pages of data was processed. The data was mainly collected from the Historic Archive of Vojvodina (Arhiv Vojvodine) and the raw data was kept in the Museum of Vojvodina. The results were first published on paper in 2008. under the title \\"On the way to the truth. Book of victims of AP Vojvodina 1941-1948\\" (title in Serbian: Na putu ka istini. Imenik stradalih stanovnika AP Vojvodine 1941-1948.) Because of the enormous amount of text, forming 9 volumes (8 of which just lists names of the victims) there was not enough money to publish it, so just 10 copies were printed. This makes this work inaccessible even to the researchers. Although the results were raw and yet unstudied to detail, they were already shocking to the public. Important step forward was the collecting of data about all known retention camps, and the victims of the period are classified by ethnic structure and also age and sex, as well as by the place of death. The weak point of this stage of the investigation was, because of the lack of material means, that about 20% of available data still remained unprocessed. As on the positive side, leader of the project dr. Dragoljub ≈Ωivkoviƒá claimed that much effort has been put and a lot of attention given to the task that there would be no duplicate entries. The public was presented only with preliminary results, primarily through the media. The representatives said (and was briefly published) that in Baƒçka, Banat, Srem and Baranja, and also in other countries but from the territory of Vojvodina, between 1941. and 1948. a total of 86.881 civilians perished (above 40.000 Serbs, above 20.000 ethnic Germans, above 15.000 Jews, about 5.000 Hungarians, about 2.700 Croats, about 1000 Slovaks and about 3000 others). The full set of data with exact numbers is available in the published volume of the \\"Na putu ka istini. Imenik stradalih stanovnika AP Vojvodine 1941-1948\\". It is important to say that this is not data that summarises victims of the 1944/45 communist purges, because it does not separates specifically the circumstances of death, but it is a raw list, with documents and literature, that was intended for future examination by experts. There is also an important statement that should be considered by the scholars of victimology, that this study showed independently that more than 12.000 inhabitants of Vojvodina, of different nationality ended up and were killed in Jasenovac and also in Banjica. It is important to stress that the publication pertains only to the civilians (unarmed persons) that lost their lives in the period 1941‚Äì1948, in retention camps, through executions etc. and not to military personnel who died in battles during the war. Two very large, unfortunate numbers demonstrate this: among the persons who lost their lives the percentage of women (as compared to men) was 49,90% in Jews and about 60% in the group of the ethnic Germans. IV. The State Commission (\\"Dr≈æavna komisija\\") ‚Äì 2009 On 9 July 2009 the government of Serbia founded a \\"Commission for the secret graves of victims killed after September 12, 1944\\" (Dr≈æavna komisija za tajne grobnice ubijenih posle 12. septembra 1944. godine).The aims and rules of the Commission ‚Äì official page (in Serbian) The choice of the date is connected with the last stage of liberation from the occupator, when on 20 October 1944, with the help from the advancing Red Army, Belgrade was liberated. Soon after that the war activity ceased, but it marked a new period of sufferings. Even before the official declaration of the end of the war, atrocities against civilians that were assumed unsympathizing with communist rule started to happen. For example, in Vojvodina the first Hungarian victims were shot, some of them openly, convicted of being a fascist, in the middle of September 1944 in Beƒçej, where also the local German population was forced to wear white armbands as a sign that they will be sent to forced labor.Kasa≈°, Aleksandar: Maƒëari u Vojvodini 1941‚Äì1946. (Novi Sad, 1996) Filozofski fakultet u Novom Sadu, Odsek za istoriju. pp. 161-162 The mission of the 2009 Commission was to locate and mark all secret graves in which bodies of those shot after the 1944. liberation lay, and also to exhume them, for the purpose of determining the cause and investigation of the circumstances of death. The first exhumations took place in 2010, in the vicity of Zajeƒçar. 29 April of the same year marked a new era in the investigation of the 1944/45 events, as the government ruled a decision to remove the stamp of secrecy from the classified documents of the Archives, where the lists of liquidated persons and other important documents resided. Now the researchers were for the first time able to look at those papers. This was an important step forward, because this was the first time that a governmental investigation focused mainly at the victims of the \\"red terror\\". V. The Academic Commission (\\"Meƒëuakademska komisija\\") ‚Äì 2010  After the collecting of data from literature and archives to build a database, the phase of in-depth scientific study and analysis followed, which is still going on. For this purpose the governments of Hungary and Serbia agreed to establish a joint Commission. This separate task force, that officially formed 15, December 2010 in Belgrade, is called \\"Hungarian‚ÄìSerbian academic Joint Committee for the civilian victims during and after the Second World War in Vojvodina, 1941-1948\\"Full name in Serbian: Meƒëuakademska komisija SANU I MAN za utvrƒëivanje civilnih ≈ærtava u Vojvodini tokom i posle Drugog svetskog rata 1941-1948 (in Serbian: Maƒëarsko‚ÄìSrpska Akademijska me≈°ovita komisija;Official site of the Serbian department in Hungarian: Magyar‚ÄìSzerb Akad√©miai Vegyes Bizotts√°gOfficial site of the Hungarian department ‚Äì oldOfficial site of the Hungarian department ‚Äì new). The Hungarian section of the Joint Committee held its inaugural meeting shortly after, at 6 January 2011. in Budapest.  The process of rehabilitation  The problem has two dimensions, one at personal level of victims and their living relatives, and one at a larger scale, on the level of the society where (and in which name of) the crimes were committed. Modern countries put efforts into dealing with all World War II irregularities, to clarify their history which sadly includes many gruesome happenings, both by the war both in the post war period. At the same time many have risen the question, could even this generation take over the responsibility for the misdoings of past political regimes that were in power seven deccades ago? Should, for example modern day Serbia and its citizens collectively be questioned about the crimes committed in the old Yugoslavia? Certainly not, but regardless, any civilised society will do all in its power to sort out the black spots of the past. Its moral duty is to do all that is possible to present past as it happened, and not a distorted version of it. On the personal level, each victims' family looks for ways to find out when, how and why their relative was executed, or if went missing to get the information about his/her whereabout. It is important to know, in cases where it was not clear, if the person was charged with a crime that deserves death and if he/she was legally and justfully prosecuted before the punishment took place. In cases where the grave still needs to be found, investigation is proposed to locate it, and in cases where the victims be proven innocent, exhumation and regular funeral is expected. The mass graves also need memorial signs (monument, plaque) over them, and that is a direct duty of the government in territory of which the crimes were conducted. The question of purges is especially important in relation to bordering countries. In case of Serbia and Hungary it is vital to assuring the future good-neighbor relations between the two countries. So excessive bilateral negotiations started between the governments, and a decision was made to start joint investigation, with involvement of professionals and academic institutions from both countries.  Case studies  It is expected that the first to be rehabilited will be public figures, such as teachers, priests and Church dignitaries, those that were executed or persecuted with clear aim to intimidate the wider public through fear, and set a harsh example. During the purges in Vojvodina, between 13 and 22 Catholic clerics were reported to be missing, 13 of whom was proven to be dead. For example, if it was known or suspected that the priest was innocent, official forensic and court procedure was on the way. In some cases a memorial or a bust was already erected, even before the trial was completed.  Opposition and critics  Many oppose the rehabilitation of victims, because they see it as a revison of history and as a possibility for injustice, where regular war criminals might get proclaimed innocent. Yet, in general society, those who claim this view remain a strong minority, especially due to unpopularity of communism, the system that ruled Eastern Europe for decades and was responsible for conducting the 1944/1945 purges in Yugoslavia.

He has done illustrations for many Malayalam writers such as Thakazhy Shivasankara Pillai, Kesavadev, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, Uroob, S. K. Pottekkatt, Edasseri Govindan Nair, and V.K.N. and is reported to be one of the most prolific literary illustrators in the world. He is a former chairman of the Kerala Lalithakala Akademi. The Akademi awarded him the Raja Ravi Varma Award in 2003. He is also a recipient of the Kerala State Film Award for Best Art Director.  Biography  the sculptures at Sukapuram temple were early inspirations for Namboothiri Namboothiri was born on 13 September 1925 at Karuvattu Mana in Ponnani, in Malappuram district of the south Indian state of Kerala to Parameshwaran Namboothiri and Sreedevi Antharjanam, as their eldest son. During his childhood, he was influenced by the sculptures at the Sukapuram temple near his house. \\"I had this urge to draw and mould sculptures after seeing these,\\" says Namboothiri. In order to pursue education in art, he moved to Chennai, with financial assistance from Krishnan Namboodiri of Varikkasseri Mana, to join the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai where he had the opportunity to study under Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury, the founder principal of the institution and S. Dhanapal. It was during this period, he came into contact with K. C. S. Paniker who would exercise influence over the young artist. Namboothiri secured two diplomas, one in fine arts and the other in applied arts, from the Government College of Fine Arts in 1954 and after staying at Cholamandal Artists' Village of K. C. S. Paniker where he completed a six-year course in one year, he returned to Kerala to join Mathrubhumi weekly as a staff artist in 1960. He stayed with Mathrubhumi until 1982 during which period, he illustrated the literary works of most of the major writers in Malayalam including Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Kesavadev, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, Uroob, S. K. Pottekkatt, Edasseri Govindan Nair, and V.K.N.. It was in Mathrubhumi, he published Naniyammayum Lokavum, which became a popular pocket cartoon series. In 1982, he moved to Kalakaumudi weekly where he provided illustrations for some more time before shifting to Samakalika Malayalam Vaarika of The New Indian Express. Namboothiri is married to Mrinalini and the couple has two sons, Parameshawaran and Vasudevan. The family lives in Naduvattam Near Edappal in Malappuram district.  Legacy  Kerala Lalithakala Akademi Durbar Hall Ground Art Gallery One of the first professional assignments done by Namboothiri was during his Chennai days, when he assisted K. C. S. Paniker to complete an oversize painting for the Indian Railways. One of the most prolific literary illustrators in the world, he turned to copper relief work after resigning from Mathrubhumi and soon organized an exhibition consisting of 12 relief works. Later, he did some of his most notable drawings at Kalakaumudi when he illustrated Randamoozham of M. T. Vasudevan Nair; he confessed later that these illustrations provided him satisfaction. Namboothiri's illustrations of his characters prompted V. K. N. to call the artist as the Paramashivan of line sketches (The Lord Shiva of Line Drawings). He is also a proponent of \\"finger painting\\". Among the copper relief works, he has done a series based on various events from Mahabharata, titled Lohabharata, and another based on Parayi Petta Panthirukulam. He has created a few large sculptures for Cholamandal which include Modern Family on a Scooter and Maithuna as well as a 500 ft long outdoor drawing featuring incidents from the Indian freedom movement. Namboothiri has served as the chairman of the Kerala Lalitakala Academy twice and it was during his tenure that the academy constructed and moved to an owned building in Thrissur. His contributions are also reported in the conversion of the Durbar Hall Ground in Kochi into an art gallery. He has embarked on a self appointed mission of pictorially documenting the cities of Kerala; the project, titled Nagarangal (The Cities), has been started with Kochi. Honours Artist Namboothiri G. Aravindan, the award-winning film director and cartoonist, was a friend of Namboothiri and when Aravindan made his debut movie, Uttarayanam, he invited Namboothiri to work as the art director of the film. The film went on to receive five Kerala State Film Awards in 1974 including the Award for Best Art Director for Namboothiri. Kerala Lalithakala Akademi awarded Namboothiri the Raja Ravi Varma Award in 2003 and he became the third recipient of the award which was instituted in 2001. The Kerala State Institute for Children's Literature awarded him the Bala Sahitya Award for best illustration for his work in Kuttikalude Ramayanam (Ramayana for children) in 2004. A documentary on the life of the artist, Namboodiri-Varayude Kulapathy (Namboodiri ‚Äî The Emperor of Lines) has been made by Ask Movies. The 44-minute documentary film, directed by Binuraj Kalapeedhom, covers the artist's life from his childhood through his Chennai days to his eighties. Varayum Vaakkum, (Lines and Words) is a book published by N. P. Vijayakrishnan, compiling Namboothiri's reminiscences and some of his drawings. Namboothiriyude Sthreekal (The Women of Namboothiri) is another book published by Vijayakrishan which has several of the artist's line drawings if women; the book also has a foreword by Mohanlal.

He was the grandson of Rabbi Yi·∏•yah Qafi·∏•, a prominent Yemenite leader and founder of the Dor Deah movement in Yemen. Qafih was the recipient of many awards, as well as an Honorary Doctorate from Bar-Ilan University. Biography Yosef Qafi·∏• was born 27 November 1917 in Sana‚Äôa in Yemen.http://www.chayas.com/rabbi.htm His father was Rabbi David Qafi·∏•, who died after being assaulted by an Arab, when his son Yosef was less than one year old. At the age of five, Yosef also lost his mother and was raised by his grandfather Rabbi Yi·∏•yah Qafi·∏•, under whom he studied Torah. In 1927, Yosef helped his grandfather retrieve the oldest complete Mishnah commentary from the Jewish community's genizah in Sana'a, containing Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham's elucidation of difficult words and passages in the Mishnah.Rabbi Yosef Qafih, recalling the event, describes it as follows: \\"There is a custom had among most of the people who assume oversight over the synagogues in Yemen that any book that has become worn-out or become very old they'd store it away in the vault situated beneath the hekhal (Ark) and this is its genizah. From time to time, when a sufficient quantity of books, fragments of books, pages and worn-out leaves [of books] has been amassed there, they collect them, place them inside earthenware jars and bury them in the cemetery, near one of the righteous men, and occasionally there are buried books, pages and leaves of valuable worth, which the same person who is meant to oversee [the affairs of the synagogue] has not fully appreciated their worth. To our happiness, many times the grave diggers are too lazy to dig deep, well beneath the earth. Wherefore, occasionally, after the rainy season, especially in the years that are blessed with plenty of rain, the heads of these jars are exposed because of rain erosion, where it eroded and made thin the upper layer of earth. My grandfather who is now deceased, the Rabbi Yihya Qafih, of blessed memory, would complain about the overseers of the synagogues and reprimand them over burying in the genizah things which contain pearls of great beneficial use, and of invaluable worth, without allowing for a man who is more adept [than he] and who knows how to examine them first and to determine what is worthy of being buried and what is still worthy of being used by the coming generations, so as to give some merit to the congregation. He commanded one of the caretakers of the cemetery that, in the event that the heads of the jars such as these should ever be exposed, he was to inform him, before he proceeded to dig deeper in order to bury them once more. I remember when I was about ten years old, the man came to inform my grandfather, of blessed memory, that such [a jar] that had been buried was now exposed. I remember that it was on a Thursday, before nightfall. On the next day, on Friday morning, my grandfather took me with him, and we went out together to the place of the genizah, according to where the informant had directed us. Now since my grandfather, of blessed memory, was already old, above eighty years in age, and it was difficult for him to bend down, I was the one who took out books and fragments of books, and ordinary pages that were wet and moldy, dusty and muddy, both hand-written manuscripts and printed texts; my grandfather, of blessed memory, sitting throughout all this time upon a stone, examining them and sorting them, one by one, until the early afternoon, and then we returned the rest inside the jar and covered it up. We took with us what we had sorted and returned to the city. At the departing of the Sabbath, my grandfather sat down to sort through his spoils, to take-apart the pages [of books] that had already stuck together because of the wetness from the rains that had penetrated within the jar. In this genizah we found hand-written pages from the Babylonian Talmud, and also fragments from Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, from Mishnah commentaries, from the commentaries of Rabbi Saadia Gaon, from the Midrash Hagadol, and many more. Whatsoever our hook brought up on that blessed day is today in my possession. Some of them still show upon them the vestiges of the soil and clay to this very day. Among the spoils, we found an old hand-written book, the majority of whose pages were already sticking together, clumps upon clumps. My grandfather sat a long time, slowly soaking them in water and with great patience, after he had checked and saw to his satisfaction that the letters were not being erased by soaking them in water. I still remember how the pages were strewn across the entire room of my grandfather's workshop, of blessed memory, so that they could dry. After drying and arranging the pages, it was clear that this was the very Mishnah commentary which we now present before our readers. This book was the only surviving sort of its kind in the world, which, had it not been for this action, it would have been lost to the world. The book was missing a few pages, in the Order known as Moed, at the introduction to Tractate Shabbat, it was missing perhaps one page, and in Tractate Pesahim it was again missing perhaps one page, as also in Tractate Yoma it was missing perhaps one page, but the remainder of the book, to our delight, was found altogether complete, from beginning to end\\" (Six Orders of the Mishnah - Commentaries of the Rishonim, vol. 1, pub. El ha-Meqorot: Jerusalem 1955, s.v. Appendix: Perush Shishah Sidrei Mishnah [Introduction], p. 6). The commentary was later published in Israel. (Young children in Yemen were often employed as copyists of ancient manuscripts.) At the age of thirteen, Yosef wrote out a complete copy of Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed in Judeo- Arabic.Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed (ed. Yosef Qafih), Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1977, Introduction (p. 23)[Hebrew]; the year given for this was 5690 anno mundi, corresponding to 1930 CE. When Yosef was 14, his grandfather died. When he and two of his acquaintances went to visit the burial-site of Yosef's grandfather, and then his father, they were accused of having burnt the grave of his grandfather's chief disputant, and were arrested and held in bonds. Because of the rift in the community between those who adhered to kabbalah and the rationalists, the two informers told the Arab authority about the young Yosef being a Jewish orphan, and that under the laws of the state's Orphans' Decree he was required to be taken under the arms of the Islamic State and converted to Islam. The child was questioned about his father and upon the realization that his forced conversion to Islam was the informants' intent‚Äìwith the arson accusation being a means to render him vulnerable to Muslim authority and attention‚Äìhe did not answer his interrogator, and was released by the prison authority for no explained reason.Avivit Levi, Holekh Tamim: the Legacy, Life and Work of Rabbi Yosef Qafih, Netanya 2015, pp. 89‚Äì95. The Imam, Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din, urgently requested that they find him a bride to bypass forced conversion to Islam as an orphaned child. Rabbi Yihye al-Abyadh (the king's physician) arranged for Yosef's marriage to Bracha Saleh (Tzadok) in the same year of his grandfather's passing. In his early years, he worked as a silversmith. In 1943 he immigrated to Mandatory Palestine, where he studied at the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva and qualified as a dayan at the Harry Fischel Institute. In 1950 he was appointed as a dayan (rabbinic judge) in the Jerusalem district court. After Rabbi Ovadia Yosef was invited to serve on the Jerusalem beth din in 1958, in addition to Rabbi Qafih and Rabbi Waldenberg, rabbis Qafih and Yosef together would constitute a non-Ashkenazic majority in the beit din of three.The Life and Scholarship of Hacham Ovadia Yosef, Yehuda Azoulay, chapter 17, by footnote 6. In 1970,The Life and Scholarship of Hacham Ovadia Yosef, Yehuda Azoulay, chapter 17, by footnote 23. Qafih was appointed as a dayan in the Supreme Rabbinical Court. Throughout the course of more than half a century, numerous rabbis sat on various rabbinical courts with him, including Rabbis Tzvi Pesach Frank, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv,I.e., prior to his 1972 resignation from the rabbinate's Supreme Beit Din due to Rabbi Shlomo Goren (Of Books and Bans p. 5, http://www.nevo.co.il/law_html/law10/YALKUT-1875.pdf#page=5 p. 453 [Hebrew]) and the brother and sister verdict.

Rabbi Yosef Qafi·∏• was a member of the Chief Rabbinate Council of Israel and president of the Yemenite community in Jerusalem. He died on 21 July 2000 at the age of 82, and is buried in Jerusalem's Har HaMenuchot cemetery. Scholarship His main work in the field of Torah literature was his translation and publication of manuscripts of numerous works by Sephardic Rishonim, including HaNivchar BeEmunot u'va-Deot of Saadia Gaon, the Torat Chovot HaLevavot by Bahya ibn Pakuda, the Kuzari by Judah ha- Levi and many other works in Judaeo-Arabic. The prime place in his oeuvre is reserved for the writings of Maimonides: he translated the Guide for the Perplexed, Commentary on the Mishnah, Sefer Hamitzvot, letters and Beiur M'lekhet HaHiggayon and edited a 24-volume set of the Mishneh Torah (posthumously divided into 25). His works and translations received recognition from the academic and Rabbinic world alike. His edition of Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah in particular is a regularly cited source in ArtScroll's Yad Avraham Mishnah Series, with Rabbis Nosson Scherman and Meir Zlotowitz recognizing it as a \\"justly acclaimed translation of what is assumed to be Rambam's own manuscript.\\"R' Nosson Scherman and R' Meir Zlotowitz in their Publisher's Preface (1981) to the third volume published in the Yad Avraham Mishnah Series (Seder Moed Vol. II [Pesachim / Shekalim]).

Qafih wrote extensively about the heritage of Yemenite Jews, describing in a book, ‚ÄúHalichot Teman‚Äù, the Jewish life in Yemen, eclipsing even the renowned works of Amram Qorah and ethnographer, Yaakov Sapir. He published several works of Yemenite Jewish provenance, such as Meor ha-Afelah by Nethanel ben Isaiah (14th-century), and Garden of the Intellects by Natan'el al-Fayyumi (12th-century). He also published a book under the title of ‚ÄúShivat Tzion‚Äù Tiklal, a Yemenite prayer book reflecting the views of Maimonides in three volumes. In 1993 he published a new version under the title of ‚ÄúSia·∏• Yerushalayim‚Äù in four volumes (posthumously edited to six). Qafi·∏•'s seminal work, however, was his commentary on Maimonides' Mishne Torah, where he highlighted textual variations based on the Yemenite handwritten manuscripts of Maimonides' Code of Jewish law. Qafi·∏• identified with the Dor Dai tendency, except that he did not publicly express opposition to the Zohar beyond saying that it was preferable to draw sustenance from the teachings of Maimonides. In his leadership of the Yemenite community in Israel he endeavored to maintain peace between the main factions in the community and worked to preserve Yemenite customs. In matters pertaining to Yemenite customs, even where later customs conflict with the earlier custom, Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu regarded the opinion of Rabbi Qafi·∏•, who he called Mori Yusef (Hebrew: ◊û◊ê◊®◊ô ◊ô◊ï◊°◊£),Hebrew source: ◊©◊™◊û◊ô◊ì ◊î◊ß◊§◊ô◊ì ◊ë◊ú◊©◊ï◊†◊ï ◊ú◊õ◊†◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊í◊®\\"◊ô ◊ß◊ê◊§◊ó ◊ë◊õ◊ô◊†◊ï◊ô: \\"◊û◊ê◊®◊ô\\", ◊¢◊ú ◊ê◊£ ◊©◊ë◊§◊ô ◊ê◊ó◊ô◊†◊ï ◊î◊°◊§◊®◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊®◊í◊ô◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊ï◊û◊® \\"◊ó◊õ◊ù\\" to be decisive.◊ë◊û◊ó◊ô◊¶◊™ ◊î◊û◊ê◊ï◊®◊ï◊™ ◊î◊í◊ì◊ï◊ú◊ô◊ù: ◊î◊í◊®\\"◊û ◊ê◊ú◊ô◊î◊ï ◊ï◊î◊í◊®\\"◊ô ◊ß◊ê◊§◊ó (Hebrew) in Or Hahalichot periodical, Tammuz 5770 issue.

It was named after its patron saint, Anthony Mary Claret, who founded the Claretians in 1849. The school also has a Child Study Center which allows girls up to the Kindergarten level.  History  The Claretian fathers dreamt of building a school in the Philippines after they had started their missions in Zamboanga and Basilan. They needed a base to serve as the center for Claretian activities in the country. In the late 1960s, Fr. Jos√© Querexeta, CMF, former bishop of the Territorial Prelature of Isabela, acquired a 29,101 square meter lot in UP Village, Diliman, Quezon City. In 1967, the construction of the first two buildings of the school (Xifr√© and Clotet) were supervised by Fr. Miguel Mialet, CMF. Fr. Santiago Gonz√°lez, CMF was the first school director and principal. Under Fr. Santiago's guidance, the school quickly grew to include the Intermediate Grade School Department in 1968 and the High School Department in 1972. In the 1970s the school upgraded the old covered court into a gymnasium, and the Immaculate Heart of Mary Parish church was built. In 1981, Gonz√°lez was replaced by Fr. Juli√°n Mateos, CMF; Fr. Jes√∫s V√°squez, CMF; Fr. Emilio Pablo, CMF; Fr. Luis Fern√°ndez Rey, CMF; and Fr. Domingo Moraleda, CMF. From 1981 until 1995, supervision of the school was transferred to Dr. Enrique Coralejo, a lay director. The 1990 Luzon earthquake forced the school to make reinforcements to the main buildings. During the same decade, the Sala building was completed as the last of the five main buildings of the campus. The Vilar√≥ and F√†bregas buildings were also built during the 1990s. From 1995 until 2000, Fr. Agapito Ferrero, CMF was the school director. In 2000, Fr. Felimon P. Libot, CMF became the first Claretian priest of Filipino descent to be assigned as school director. He was superseded by Fr. Salvador G. Agualada, CMF in 2006. In 2007, the school celebrated its 40th anniversary and the TLE building was completed.Tanglaw: A 40th Foundation Anniversary Special p.6Claret School Student Handbook Revised 2008 pp. 3‚Äì4 In the middle of SY 2008-2009, the former school director, Domingo Moraleda died in an accident in Mabalacat, Pampanga.http://www.gmanews.tv/story/130814/Overtaking-bus-slams-into-car-in- Pampanga-5-dead-56-hurt# On June 1, 2009, Fr. Eduardo C. Apungan, CMF took office as the school director. He was superseded in 2010 by Fr. Renato L. Manubag, CMF. In May 2013, Very Rev. Fr. Christian James L. Castro, CMF assumed directorship of the school. In 2016, Very Rev. Fr. Efr√©n Limpo, CMF assumed position as the 14th school director of Claret School of Quezon City. He was succeeded by Very Rev. Fr. Mauricio T. Ulep, the current school director. The first elementary graduates completed their studies in 1971, while the pioneer high school class graduated in 1975 with 38 students. A plaque with the names of the first 38 high school graduates can be seen in the main lobby of Claret School. On October 22, 2016, Claret School of Quezon City was honored with the Quezon City Manuel L. Quezon Gawad Parangal Award for Most Outstanding Institution for 2016 at the Crowne Plaza Galleria Hotel, Ortigas Avenue, Quezon City. Organization Claret School of Quezon City is composed of the Child Study Center, the Grade School department and the High School department. The Grade School and High School units were established in 1967, while the Child Study Center was opened in June 2001. Child Study Center The Center admits 3-year-old boys and girls for Junior Nursery, 4-year-olds for Senior Nursery and 5-year-olds for the Kindergarten level. From Kindergarten, the curriculum ladder extends to the Preparatory (prep) level which was integrated to the Grade School in 1967. Elementary and secondary education The Grade School unit of Claret School of Quezon City was accredited by the PAASCU on March 15, 1978. It was granted reaccreditation in 1982, 1988, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and the latest is valid until 2020. The High School unit received its accreditation by PAASCU on April 19, 1991. It was granted reaccreditation in 1995, 2001, 2006, and 2010. Aside from its membership in the PAASCU, Claret School of Quezon City also takes active roles in the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP), the QC-Marikina Grade School Consortium, and the Private Secondary School Administrators Association of the Philippines (PRISSAAP). In sports, Claret School won its first Philippine Athletic Youth Association (PAYA) Basketball Championship in the 1974-1975 season, beating San Agustin in the Finals. Expansion In the school year 2003‚Äì2004, the Association of Claret Schools in the Philippines, Inc. (ACSPI) was formally established and this further strengthened the linkages of the four Claret Schools in the Philippines: Claret School of Quezon City, Claret School of Zamboanga in Zamboanga City, Claret College of Isabela in Isabela City, Claret School of Lamitan in Lamitan City, Claret School of Maluso and Claret School of Tumahubong in Basilan Province.

It is now part of DnB NOR. History Fellesbanken was created with two functions. First of all it was to function as a central bank for the savings banks of Norway. Originally the savings banks of Norway were all independent banks without branches, though they still had a need for central banking functions. It was not until after World War II that it became normal for savings banks to merge and the need for such a central bank depleted. Fellesbanken was also a commercial bank, and allowed the savings banks to have such a bank. Commercial banks had certain privileges that savings banks didn't, especially within the business sector. These privileges disappeared, and by the time of their merger they were non-existent. In the 1970s Fellesbanken established branches in Bergen, Bod√∏, Kristiansand, Sarpsborg, Troms√∏, Trondheim and Vads√∏. After the establishment of regional savings banks Fellesbanken became redundant and a competitor, and in the 1980s the bank was made a savings bank. In 1985 it merged with Sparebanken Oslo/Akershus.

There is a consensus that the processes involved are extensions of standard software engineering processes. Considering this, along with its unique characteristics, popular frameworks used include the spiral approach and business-oriented approach to application development, among other models that address the requirements for an iterative process. Just as with a traditional desktop application, web applications have varying levels of risk. A personal home page is much less risky than, for example, a stock trading web site. For some projects security, software bugs, etc. are major issues. If time to market or technical complexity is a concern, documentation, test planning, change control, requirements analysis, architectural description and formal design and construction practices can mitigate risk. Technologies A study conducted involving web engineering practice revealed that web application development has several characteristics that have to be addressed and these include: short development life-cycle times; different business models; multi-disciplinary development teams; small development teams working on similar tasks; business analysis and evaluation with end-users; explicit requirement and rigorous training against requirements; and, maintenance. Some of the technologies used include: Ajax, ASP, ASP.NET, ActionScript, CSS, ColdFusion, CGI, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Visual LANSA, Lasso, Node.js, OSGI, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Xojo. Lifecycle model Time to market, company- growth and requirements churn, three things that are emphasized in web-based business, coincide with the principles of the Agile practices. Some agile lifecycle models are: * Extreme programming * Scrum * Timebox development * Feature-driven development Testing Web applications undergo the same unit, integration and system testing as traditional desktop applications. It has the same goals, which involve: 1) the determination that the application is working correctly; and, 2) the identification of errors that need correction. The testing process of web applications, however, has some special characteristics, making it a little different from a test used for a software. These include the fact that web applications tend to have a great deal of information that could contain mistakes, omissions, incorrect labels, redundancy, and so on. They can also entail multiple layers of web applications and multiple, dynamic configurations. Testing and finding errors, therefore, involves more complex process such as the inclusion of operational analysis for each layer or configuration. Web application clients vary greatly, hence teams might perform some additional testing, such as: Security, Performance, Load, and Stress, HTML/CSS validation, Accessibility, Usability, and Cross-browser. Many types of tests are automatable. At the component level, one of the xUnit packages can be a helpful tool. Or an organization can create its own unit testing framework. At the GUI level, Watir or iMacros are useful. Tools In the case of ASP.NET, developers can use Microsoft Visual Studio to write code. But, as with most other programming languages, they can also use a text editor (Notepad++ for example). WebORB Integration Server for .NET can be used to integrate .NET services, data and media with any web client. It includes developer-productivity tools and APIs for remoting, messaging and data management. For ColdFusion and the related open-source CFML engines, there are several tools available for writing code. These include Adobe Dreamweaver CS4, the CFEclipse plugin for Eclipse (software) and Adobe CF Builder. One can also use any text editor, such as Notepad++ or TextEdit. Many tools support the Java programming language. The most popular include Apache Tomcat, GlassFish, JDeveloper and Netbeans, but there are numerous others. For PHP, the Zend Development Environment provides numerous debugging tools and provides a rich feature-set to make PHP development easier. WebORB Integration Server for PHP can be used to integrate PHP classes and data with any web client. It includes developer productivity tools and APIs for remoting, messaging and data management. Tools such as Hammerkit abstract PHP into a visual programming environment and utilise component-based software methods to accelerate development. Other tools include various web development applications, browsers, and FTP clients. Frameworks and use Practicing code reuse and using web application frameworks can greatly improve both productivity and time to market (McConnell 1996:537). Reusing externally developed components can allow an organization to reap the above benefits, while potentially saving money. However, for smaller components, it might be just as easy to develop your own components as it would be to learn new APIs. Also, if a component is essential to the business, an organization might want to control its development.

Richard Scaldwell's JAP-engined GN Grand Prix special at the VSCC SeeRed race meeting, Donington Park, September 2007. The GN has a 5.1 litre V8 aero-engine shoehorned into its lightweight cyclecar frame. The GN was a British cyclecar made in London, between 1910 and 1925, The name derived from its founders, H.R. Godfrey and Archibald Frazer-Nash. Production ceased in 1923 but the company kept trading until 1925. History The GN cyclecar was made in Hendon, North London, between 1910 and 1925, then moving to Wandsworth, London. The name derives from its founders, H.R. Godfrey (1887-1968) and Archibald Frazer-Nash (1889-1965). Production ceased in 1923 but the company kept trading until 1925. After making several cars for their own use, the two founders launched the GN car in 1909, building them in the stables at the Frazer Nash family home. The car was powered by a V twin engine by JAP or Peugeot with belt drive to the rear wheels. By 1911, production had moved to Hendon and GN's own 1100 cc engine, using some Peugeot parts being fitted. The engine was mounted in the chassis with the crankshaft parallel to the front axle, driving through a two-speed transmission by chain and dog clutch, then by belt to the rear wheels. The two-seat car was very light, weighing only about . Therefore, in spite of the low power available, was achievable, which was very respectable performance for the time. The engine was turned 90 degrees in 1913, with its cylinder heads protruding through the bonnet sides, and a team was entered into the French Cyclecar Grand Prix resulting, in sports models being added to the range. Some 200 cars had been made when production stopped with the outbreak of World War I. Production restarted in 1919, and shortly afterward the company was bought by British Gr√©goire Ltd and moved to East Hill, Wandsworth in south west London. The chassis changed from wood to steel, with the chain type transmission now with three speeds and reverse. At the peak, 500 staff were employed, making 55 cars a month. A licence to make the cars was agreed with the French maker Salmson who made about 1600 cars. By 1921, the cyclecar boom was on the wane and the company went into receivership, but was soon sold. The new owner, a Mr Black, wanted to move to much higher production levels and away from sports cars. A four- cylinder water-cooled model with 1098 cc DFP engine and shaft drive to a differential on the solid rear axle was introduced in 1922 as part of the new policy, and Godfrey and Frazer Nash left the company later that year. In 1923 a Chapuis-Dornier engine replaced the DFP, but production of the new car and the old V twin model stopped in May. About 4000 cars of all types were made by GN in the post war period. A new company was founded by some ex-employees and a few more cars were made from parts in 1924 and 1925, but the main business was spares and service. In 1925 the company became General Motors dealers. H.R. Godfrey went on to found a new car company, Godfrey-Proctor, and later HRG. Frazer Nash formed the car maker that took his name where he re- introduced his chain and clutch transmission system. Famous GNs The most notable racing GNs were Archie Fraser-Nash's \\"Mowgli\\", \\"Kim\\" and Basil Davenport's \\"Spider\\", \\"BHD\\" and his \\"Big Spider\\". Other famous pre war \\"GN Specials\\" were \\"Wasp\\", \\"Wilkes-GN\\", \\"GNat\\", \\"Martyr\\", \\"The Becke Powerplus\\", \\"The Wilkes GN\\" \\"The Chawner GN\\", \\"Grasshopper\\" & \\"COGNAC\\", all of them very successful hill climb cars of the 1920s and 1930s. Many still compete today, alongside a number of machines recently constructed from period parts. Spider was an extremely successful sprint car and held the outright record at Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb several times in the 1920s.

Dartmouth and the neighbouring metropolitan area of Halifax form the urban core of the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Both cities, along with the town of Bedford and the Municipality of the County of Halifax were dissolved on April 1, 1996 when they were amalgamated into HRM. Mi'kmaq Establishing a Protestant settlement on shores of Chebucto (Dartmouth/ Halifax) was a strategic British manoeuver to control Acadia and defeat France in North America. The claims the Mi'kmaq had to the land were virtually ignored. The Mi'kmaq occupied the region for millennia. The Mi'kmaq called the area Ponamogoatitjg (Boonamoogwaddy), which has been varyingly translated as \\"Tomcod Ground\\" or \\"Salmon Place\\" in reference to the fish which were presumably caught in this part of Halifax Harbour. There is evidence that bands would spend the summer on the shores of the Bedford Basin, moving to points inland before the harsh Atlantic winter set in. From Dartmouth Cove, the Mi'kmaq would have followed an important canoe route inland via the Dartmouth lakes to the Sipekne'katik (Shubenacadie) waterway. The Mi'kmaq resisted the settlement of Dartmouth by the British. One of Halifax's last surviving Mi'kmaq communities was located at Turtle Grove near present-day Tuft's Cove but was devastated in the December 6, 1917 Halifax Explosion. Today the Millbrook First Nation has a small satellite reserve in Cole Harbour on the eastern edge of Dartmouth. Eighteenth Century Father Le Loutre‚Äôs War Despite the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq. Father Le Loutre's War began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with 13 transports on June 21, 1749.Grenier, John. The Far Reaches of Empire. War in Nova Scotia, 1710-1760.

(2002 edition). p 7 By unilaterally establishing Halifax the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi'kmaq (1726), which were signed after Father Rale's War.; ; Also see The British quickly began to build other settlements. To guard against Mi'kmaq, Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements, British fortifications were erected in Halifax (1749), Bedford (Fort Sackville) (1749), Dartmouth (1750), Lunenburg (1753) and Lawrencetown (1754). During Father Le Loutre‚Äôs War, there were 8 raids on Dartmouth.For the Raids on Dartmouth see the Diary of John Salusbury (diarist): Expeditions of Honour: The Journal of John Salusbury in Halifax; also see A genuine narrative of the transactions in Nova Scotia since the settlement, June 1749, till August the 5th, 1751 [microform] : in which the nature, soil, and produce of the country are related, with the particular attempts of the Indians to disturb the colony / by John Wilson.

The community was later given the English name of Dartmouth in honour of William Legge, 1st Earl of Dartmouth who was a former Secretary of State. Raid on Dartmouth (1749) The Mi'kmaq saw the founding of Halifax without negotiation as a violation of earlier agreements with the British. On 24 September 1749 the Mi'kmaq formally declared their hostility to the British plans for settlement without more formal negotiations. On September 30, 1749, about forty Mi'kmaq attacked six men who were in Dartmouth cutting trees at the saw mill which was under the command of Major Gilman. Four of them were killed, two of whom were scalped, the heads of two were cut off, one was taken prisoner and one escaped giving the alarm.Harry Chapman.

The result of the raid, on October 2, 1749, Cornwallis offered a bounty on the head of every Mi'kmaq. He set the amount at the same rate that the Mi'kmaq received from the French for British scalps. As well, to carry out this task, two companies of rangers raised, one led by Captain Francis Bartelo and the other by Captain William Clapham. These two companies served alongside that of John Gorham's company. The three companies scoured the land around Halifax looking for Mi'kmaq.Thomas Beamish Akins.

In October 1750 a group of about eight men went out \\"to take their diversion; and as they were fowling, they were attacked by the Indians, who took the whole prisoners; scalped ...

In 1785, at the end of the American Revolution, a group of Quakers from Nantucket arrived in Dartmouth to set up a whaling trade. They built homes, a Quaker meeting house, a wharf for their vessels and a factory to produce spermaceti candles and other products made from whale oil and carcasses. It was a profitable venture and the Quakers employed many local residents, but within ten years, around 1795, the whalers moved their operation to Wales. Only one Quaker residence remains preserved in Dartmouth (others have been modernized) and is believed to be the oldest structure in Dartmouth.Historic Places CanadaDartmouth Heritage Museum Loyalists Other families soon arrived in Dartmouth, among them was the Hartshorne family. They were Loyalists who arrived in 1785, and received a grant that included land bordering present-day Portland, King and Wentworth Streets. Woodlawn was once part of the land purchased by a Loyalist, named Ebenezer Allen who became a prominent Dartmouth businessman. In 1786, he donated land near his estate to be used as a cemetery. Many early settlers are interred in the Woodlawn cemetery including the remains of the \\"Babes in the Woods,\\" two sisters who wandered into the forest and perished.{25} Nineteenth Century By the early 19th century, Dartmouth consisted of about twenty-five families working as a sawmill and agricultural outpost of Halifax. However, in the mid 19th century, Dartmouth grew quickly, first with the construction of the Shubenacadie Canal in the 1820s and more importantly with the rise of successful industrial firms such as the Dartmouth Marine Slips founded in 1850. Within twenty years, there were sixty houses, a church, gristmill, shipyards, saw mill, two inns and a bakery located near the harbour. In 1860, Starr Manufacturing Company began operations near the Shubenacadie Canal. The factory employed over 150 workers and manufactured one of the world's first mass-produced ice skates, as well as cut nails, vault doors, iron bridge work and other heavy iron products. The Mott's candy and soap factory, employing 100, opened at Hazelhurst (near present-day Hazelhurst and Newcastle Streets). The Stairs Ropeworks, later Consumer Cordage, was a rope factory on Wyse Road offered work to over 300 and created its own residential neighborhood. The Symonds Foundry employed a further 50 to 100 people. As the population grew, more houses were erected and new businesses established. Subdivisions such as Woodlawn, Woodside and Westphal developed on the outskirts of the town. The Tallahassee Escape During the American Civil War, on August 18, 1864, the Confederate ship CSS Tallahassee under the command of John Taylor Wood sailed into Halifax harbour for supplies, coal and to make repairs to her mainmast. Wood began loading coal at Woodside, on the Dartmouth shore. Two union ships were closing in on the Tallahassee, the Nansemont and the Huron. While Wood was offered an escort out of the harbour he instead slipped out of the harbour under the cover of night by going through the seldom used Eastern Passage between McNab‚Äôs Island and the Dartmouth Shore. The channel was narrow and crooked with a shallow tide so Wood hired the local pilot Jock Flemming. The Tallahassee left the Woodside wharf at 9:00 p.m. on the 19th. All the lights were out, but the residents on the Eastern Passage mainland could see the dark hull moving through the water, successfully evading capture.Greg Marquis. In Armagedon's Shadow: The Civil War and Canada's Maritime Provinces, (1998) McGill Queens Press, p. 233 Incorporation as a Town In 1873 Dartmouth was incorporated as a town and a Town Hall was established in 1877. In 1883 \\"The Dartmouth Times\\" began publishing. In 1885 a railway station was built, and the first passenger service starts in 1886 with branch lines running to Windsor Junction by 1896 and the Eastern Shore by 1904. Two attempts were made to bridge The Narrows of Halifax Harbour with a railway line during the 1880s but were washed away by powerful storms. These attempts were abandoned after the line to Windsor Junction was completed. The line running through Dartmouth was envisioned to continue along the Eastern Shore to Canso or Guysborough, however developers built it inland along the Musquodoboit River at Musquodoboit Harbour and it ended in the Musquodoboit Valley farming settlement of Upper Musquodoboit, ending Dartmouth's vision of becoming a railway hub. Twentieth century Blast cloud from the Bedford Magazine Explosion Halifax Explosion The Dartmouth side of the harbour was not as densely populated as Halifax and was separated from the blast by the width of the harbour, but still suffered heavy damage. Estimates are that almost 100 people died on the Dartmouth side. Windows were shattered and many buildings were damaged or destroyed, including the Oland Brewery and parts of the Starr Manufacturing Company.\\"Starr Manufacturing Company.\\" Nova Scotia Hospital was the only hospital on the Dartmouth side of the harbour and many of the victims were treated there. Bedford Magazine Explosion During World War II Dartmouth as with Halifax was busy supporting Canada's war effort in Europe. On July 18, 1945, at the end of the Second World War, a fire broke out at the magazine jetty on the Bedford Basin, north of Dartmouth. The fire began on a sunken barge and quickly spread to the dock. A violent series of large explosions ensued as stored ammunition exploded. The barge responsible for starting the explosion presently lies on the seabed near the eastern shoreline adjacent to the Magazine Dock. Postwar Boom Dartmouth saw rapid growth after 1954 when the Angus L. Macdonald Bridge opened, finally providing a direct roadlink to Halifax. The completion of the Macdonald Bridge allowed rapid suburban residential development and prompted the construction of shopping centres such as the original Dartmouth Shopping Centre at the foot of the bridge and Mic Mac Mall. Amalgamation to City Of Dartmouth In 1961 the communities of Woodlawn, Woodside and Westphal along with the area of the town of Dartmouth joined together to become the \\"City Of Dartmouth\\" the city was the third largest city in Nova Scotia, after Halifax and Sydney. Amalgamation to Halifax Regional Municipality During the 1990s, Dartmouth like many other Canadian cities, amalgamated with its suburbs under a single municipal government. The provincial government had sought to reduce the number of municipal governments throughout the province as a cost-saving measure and created a task force in 1992 to pursue this rationalization. In 1995, an Act to Incorporate the Halifax Regional Municipality received Royal Assent in the provincial legislature and the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) was created on April 1, 1996. HRM is an amalgamation of all municipal governments in Halifax County, these being the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, town of Bedford, and Municipality of the County of Halifax). Dartmouth still retained its place name and identity The term \\"Dartmouthians\\", still refers to the residents living in the area of Dartmouth, the regional municipality is often referred by its full name or the initials \\"HRM\\" especially in the media refers to the municipal government or the whole area of the Halifax Regional Municipality .

La Paz was the location of the earliest Spanish activity in Baja California, and was frequently the site of conflicts between the Spanish and the local Guaycura and Peric√∫ Indians. Fort√∫n Xim√©nez, mutineer on an expedition sent by Hern√°n Cort√©z, landed at La Paz in 1533. Two years later, Cort√©s himself led a large party that attempted but failed to establish a settlement. Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no in 1596 gave it its anomalously pacific name. Isidro de Atondo y Antill√≥n and Eusebio Francisco Kino attempted to establish a mission settlement in 1683 but again failed because of conflicts with the native inhabitants. When Jesuit missions finally took root in Baja California after 1697, the initial focus of activity was to the north, in the area around Loreto. The Jesuits finally returned to the site of Airap√≠ (probably a Guaycura name) in 1720, in coordinated expeditions from Loreto that traveled both by sea (under Ugarte and Bravo) and overland (under Clemente Guill√©n). The mission had little success, however. It was sacked in the Peric√∫ Revolt of 1734 and finally abandoned in 1748, when its Indian neophytes were relocated to Todos Santos.

Biography Discovered by Catholic nuns while singing high masses in his Catholic Church (St. Elizabeth in East St. Louis), and a high- school talent show favorite, Phil Perry wrote and recorded his first single \\"Hey You\\" with The Montclairs, who were also based in East St. Louis. They were signed to the Archway Records label just before Perry turned 17 years old in 1969. The song is considered to be the first of a classic soul collection of Perry 'Old School' singles popular in the 1970s. In 1972, The Montclairs recorded for Paula Records with minor soul ballads that included \\"Dreaming's out of Season,\\" \\"Prelude to a Heartbreak,\\" and \\"Begging's Hard to Do.\\" The Montclairs left Paula Records and disbanded in 1975. Perry then moved to California with former Montclair Kevin Sanlin, recording as a duo, resulting in two albums at Capitol Records in the early 1980s that were produced by Chuck Jackson and Dr. Cecil Hale. One song, \\"Just to Make You Happy,\\" had a respectable level of success in radio. In the 1990s, Perry scored his first number-one R&B; hit \\"Call Me\\" (previously recorded and written by Aretha Franklin), a remake of the 1970 hit, as well as the top-forty R&B; singles \\"Amazing Love\\" and \\"Forever\\" (written by Brenda Russell), all from the album The Heart of the Man (1991), his first solo release. Perry is also featured on many GRP Records projects, and is considered to be a GRP all-star, featured with such smooth-jazz icons as guitarists Lee Ritenour and Russ Freeman, and pianist Don Grusin. Perry is a featured vocalist on recordings by Michel Colombier, Don Grusin, Dave Grusin, Freddie Hubbard, George Duke, Najee, Bill Withers, Barbra Streisand, June Pointer, Johnny Mathis, The Benoit-Freeman Project (David Benoit & Russ Freeman), Sergio Mendes, Bobby Womack, Chaka Khan, Fourplay, George Benson, and Will Downing, among others. Solo hits also include \\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\" and \\"One Heart, One Love.\\" He is also featured on the Bebe's Kids soundtrack singing a track with the late Renee Diggs. Other film song credits include Roots, Pretty in Pink, Short Circuit, Mr. Wonderful, Nice Girls Don't Explode, Riding Bean, Captain Ron, and a cameo appearance in the 2009 release of the Harrison Ford film Crossing Over. In 1991 he released his first solo album on Capitol Records, and toured with labelmate Dave Koz for the next several years, going on to record 4 more albums. On September 11, 2001, Perry was scheduled to perform at the World Trade Center's lunch-hour jazz concert series between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. As fate would have it, he was spared from the devastation of the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers. However, for the next few years, he sank into an artistic depression, and did not record again until invited by longtime friend Don Grusin, who he joined in September 2003 for a collaborative venture titled \\"The Hang.\\" This CD/DVD project was nominated for a Grammy Award, and included Dave Grusin, Harvey Mason, Patti Austin, Natali Renee, Abraham Laboriel, Alex Acuna, Ernie Watts, Lee Ritenour, and others. In 2006, former co-producer of the Magic album, Chris \\"Big Dog\\" Davis, urged Perry to record a collection of R&B; hits titled Classic Love Songs as an independent one-off project for Shanachie Records. Since that time, Perry has recorded four projects for that label with Davis, including a project with Melba Moore. In 2007 he reunited with Dave Koz and toured the country. The same year, he released the album \\"Mighty Love,\\" for which he was voted the 2007 Male Vocalist of the Year in the SoulTracks Readers' Choice Awards. In 2008, Perry recorded a duet album with Tony Award-winning vocalist Melba Moore titled \\"The Gift of Love.\\" It was awarded the Duo Album of the Year Award in the SoulTracks Readers Choice Awards. After returning from a South African trip, Perry became ill during a performance with Pieces of a Dream, in October 2009, at Southern Connecticut State University. Unsubstantiated rumors began to circulate that he had died. While there is no definitive medical diagnosis for the collapse, he was treated at a local New Haven hospital and released with the strong recommendation that he take some time off and rest. In 2010, \\"Ready for Love\\" was released by Shanachie. Inspired to continue writing after his health scare, this effort featured more Phil Perry originals than in any of his earlier releases, which was said to be of great satisfaction to him. March 2013 saw the release of Say Yes, his 10th solo album, and the 5th on Shanachie. It charted in the Top Ten on Billboard and A.C. Smooth jazz charts, as well as receiving Smooth Jazz top vocal credits. Two years after its release, Say Yes continued its steady climb to become one of Billboard's 2014 top smooth-jazz singles, featuring Perry in a classic duet cover of Where Is the Love? with Chant√© Moore. The 11th solo release from Perry on the Shanachie label‚Äî\\"A Better Man\\"‚Äîwas #1 on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz chart in the first week of its release.

Going (UK), track condition (US) or track rating (AUS) are the track surface of a horse racing track prior to a horse race or race meet. The going is determined by the amount of moisture in the ground and is assessed by an official steward on the day of the race. The condition of a race track plays an important role in the performance of horses in a race. The factors that go into determining race track condition include the surface conditions, type of surface, and track configuration. The surface conditions are influenced by the type of surface factoring in soil type, and if the track is dirt, turf, artificial surface; plus surface density, porosity, compaction and moisture content. Australia Prior to a race meeting, an inspection of the racecourse‚Äôs surface is conducted by officials. This process consists of a visual inspection and the use of a tool called a penetrometer which measures the soil‚Äôs resistance to penetration. The inspection is conducted before the meeting to allow publication of the track rating for the benefit of punters and trainers. In the case of rain prior to a meeting, a much earlier inspection will be made to permit an early decision as to whether the meeting can proceed, before travelling horses depart for the meeting. Tracks may be upgraded or downgraded while a race meeting is taking place. The main reasons for this is that sun/heat is able to dry out the track during the course of the day possibly resulting in track upgrade or that inclement weather and rain continues as the racing continues (track downgrade). Jockeys, too, will be involved in inspections made during the meeting if there is any doubt as to the safety of riding on a downgraded or wet track. Retrieved 2015-8-21 On December 1 2014, the Australian Racing Board (ARB) put into place a revised 10 point system using ratings from Firm 1 through to Heavy 10. The revised system removes the terms ‚ÄòFast‚Äô, ‚ÄòDead‚Äô, and ‚ÄòSlow‚Äô replacing them with ‚ÄòFirm‚Äô and 'Soft‚Äô while also retaining the terms ‚ÄòGood‚Äô and ‚ÄòHeavy‚Äô. Retrieved 2015-8-21 Below are the official ratings recognised by all race clubs in Australia:Australian Horse Racing Track Ratings Retrieved 2015-8-21 *Firm 1: Dry hard track *Firm 2: Firm track with reasonable grass coverage *Good 3: Track with good grass coverage and cushion *Good 4: Track with some give in it *Soft 5: Track with a reasonable amount of give in it *Soft 6: Moist but not a badly affected track *Soft 7: More rain- affected track that will chop out *Heavy 8: Rain affected track that horses will get into *Heavy 9: Wet track getting into a squelchy area *Heavy 10: Heaviest category track, very wet, towards saturation Additionally, a rating of AWT is being used to signify an All Weather Track, which equates to a Good (4) surface under some bad weather conditions. United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland In the UK and Republic of Ireland, there are seven grades of surface, which are: *hard *firm *good to firm *good *good to soft *soft *heavy Since 2009, in addition to the official description of the going, British racecourses are required to report penetrometer readings on the day of the race. A penetrometer designed by Cranfield University and TurfTrax, known as the 'GoingStick', is used for these measurements. The 'hard' grade is rarely used, as a racetrack with this type of surface is generally deemed to be dangerous to both horses and jockeys. No races took place on tracks rated as 'hard going' between 2008 and 2013. In Ireland the term \\"yielding\\" is used for \\"good to soft\\" going. For artificial surfaces in the UK the official grades are: *fast *standard to fast *standard *standard to slow *slow USA In the United States, different systems are used for turf racetracks and dirt tracks. Artificial surfaces (called all-weather tracks in official charts) use the dirt track rating system. For dirt tracks the track conditions are: *fast: dry, even, resilient surface *wet fast - track has surface water on it, but base is still solid. times are similar to, or sometimes faster than, a fast track. occurs immediately after a heavy rain *good: a track that is almost fast *muddy: a track that is wet but has no standing water *sloppy: a track saturated with water; with standing water visible *slow: a track wet on both the surface and base *sealed: A track surface that has been packed down. A sealed dry tracks allows water to run off the track, reducing the amount of precipitation absorbed. Wet tracks are sealed to provide a safe and even racing surface For turf tracks, the track conditions are: *firm: a firm, resilient surface *good: a turf course slightly softer than firm *yielding: a turf course with a significant amount of \\"give\\" to the ground due to recent rain *soft: a turf course with a large amount of moisture.

He attended Oakwood University in Huntsville, Alabama, earning a Bachelor of Arts in History, Sociology, and Theology. He also went on to earn a Master of Arts degree in Theology at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan, as well as a Master of Arts Degree in Ethnic Studies at the University at Albany, SUNY. He is an ordained Seventh-day Adventist minister, who resigned shortly before entering politics.Desert Mayor Seeks Assembly Seat ¬´ Ron Oden Media  Politics  In 1990, Oden moved to Palm Springs, California to begin teaching at the College of the Desert as an adjunct Sociology instructor. Concern about educational and social issues motivated Oden to enter politics, and in 1995, he was elected to the Palm Springs City Council. In 2000, Oden ran for Congress on a limited budget, capturing 38% of the vote. In 2003, Oden was elected Mayor of Palm Springs. As the first openly gay African American mayor elected in California, Oden's election made global news headlines. Oden's tenure as mayor was notable for his work promoting organizations focused on diversity, including the Palm Springs Human Rights Task Force, the Palm Springs Human Rights Commission, and the Palm Springs branch of the NAACP. Oden also brought in the Palm Springs City Council's first gay majority. Palm Springs saw historical growth during Oden's tenure, with the city's budget doubling during his term. Oden saw success in building Palm Springs as a destination resort city, helped by a new concourse being added to the Palm Springs International Airport in 2007 and new amenities like the Palm Springs Skatepark, considered one of California's best skateparks. In June 2006, he ran forJonathan Abrams, \\"Desert Mayor Runs for Assembly,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 8, 2006, image 6 Interview and photograph. via Newspapers.com and lost in the Democratic primary for a seat in the California State Assembly by less than 100 votes.

He campaigned on a platform calling for governmental transparency and restoration of trust and faith in city leadership. He wanted elected officials to disclose their income and its sources, a response to allegations of \\"conflict of interest between the current mayor Steve Pougnet and a private developer.\\" Oden wanted to restore the proper course of conduct to investors and entrepreneurs: \\"Businessmen are investors in our city. They‚Äôre not bad people but I think people get stirred and go the wrong way.‚Äù Oden also wanted to assuage the ‚Äúeroding relationship‚Äù with the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and address the status of a west campus for College of the Desert. He used to teach there, and it disappeared without much discussion. Finally, Oden acknoweledged that he had been out of politics for several years, and said he \\"hopes to channel Frank Bogert,\\" the city's first directly elected mayor, who successfully \\"came back for seconds\\" almost three decades later. Oden lost the election to Robert Moon.  Personal Life and Legacy  Oden is openly bisexual and is the father of two daughters, Brooke and Brittany.

It stood as Buenos Aires' tallest building for more than a decade until the construction of the Kavanagh Building in 1936. Its twin brother, Palacio Salvo, is a building designed and erected in Eclectic style, built by the same architect in Montevideo. This building was declared a national historic monument in 1997.Decreto 437/97 Currently, the building has several travel agencies, a Spanish school for foreigners, a store that sells clothes for tango, offices and studios of architects, accountants, lawyers, and designers. History Italian architect Mario Palanti was commissioned to design the building by the empresario Luis Barolo, an Italian immigrant who had arrived in Argentina in 1890 and had made a fortune in knitted fabrics. The basic design, in eclectic style, was conceived simultaneously with one for the Palacio Salvo in Montevideo, Uruguay. The Palacio Barolo was designed in accordance with the cosmology of Dante's Divine Comedy, motivated by the architect's admiration for Alighieri. There are 22 floors, divided into three \\"sections\\". The basement and ground floor represent hell, floors 1-14 are purgatory, and 15-22 represent heaven. The building is tall, one meter for each canto of the Divine Comedy. The lighthouse at the top of the building can be seen all the way in Montevideo, Uruguay. The owner planned to use only 3 floors, and to rent the rest. When completed in 1923 it was the tallest building, not only in the city, but also in the whole of South America. It remained the city's tallest building until 1935 when, on completion, the Kavanagh Building acquired this distinction. Today it houses mainly lawyers' offices, a Spanish-language school, and a store that sells Tango clothing. Technical details The steel-structured skyscraper measures 100 meters and has 18 floors; each floor has a unique design and ornamentation. Staying with the Divine Comedy (in addition to the meter for each canto), the lighted beacon at the top of the building represents the nine choirs of angels. The structure is topped by a small spire with an ornament depicting the Southern Cross constellation. The building is listed in the Emporis database. The building's foundations conform to the golden ratio. The skyscraper was constructed to house Dante's ashes; Barolo believed \\"that Europe had begun drifting toward collapse\\" and wanted to house them as far away as possible from the Continent. The lobby features a central hall adorned with inscriptions in Latin verse and monster statues. It radiates out from a central dome into nine vaulted archways; these represent the nine circles of hell as described the Inferno. The first three floors have geometric figures representing the alchemical symbols for fire, the colors of the Italian flag, and various Masonic symbols on the walls and floors. The lobby also has operational antiquated elevators. The lighthouse on the top of the building along with the Palacio Salvo in Montevideo, Uruguay, were designed to serve as a welcome to visitors arriving from the Atlantic Ocean to the Rio de la Plata estuary, similar to the Pillars of Hercules. The ornamental spire aligns with the actual Southern Cross constellation on July 9, Argentine Independence Day.

It sets harmonised standards for eligibility and protection of most types of registered design.  Eligible designs  A design is defined as \\"the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular, the lines, contours, colours, shape, texture and/or materials of the product itself and/or its ornamentation\\" (Art. 2). Designs may be protected if: *they are novel, that is if no identical design has been made available to the public; *they have individual character, that is the \\"informed user\\" would find it different from other designs which are available to the public. Where a design forms part of a more complex product, the novelty and individual character of the design are judged on the part of the design which is visible during normal use. Designs are not protected insofar as their appearance is wholly determined by their technical function, or by the need to interconnect with other products to perform a technical function (the \\"must-fit\\" exception). However modular systems such as Lego or Mechano may be protected [Art. 8(3)].  Design right protection  The holder of a registered design right has the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit others from using the design in any way, notably by producing, importing, selling or using products based on the design. However, rightholders may not prevent private and non-commercial use, use for research or use for teaching. There is also an exception for foreign-registered ships and aeroplanes, based on the principles of maritime sovereignty. Protection under a registered design right last initially for one or more periods of five years, and may be renewed up to a maximum total of twenty-five years. In respect of a given product, they are exhausted when it is sold with the consent of the rightholder (the first-sale doctrine). Protection by a registered design right does not affect any other intellectual property rights in the product, notably unregistered design rights, patents and trade marks. The question of copyright protection is left to the laws of the Member States, which apply varying criteria of originality to the copyright protection of \\"applied art\\"; the point, however, is that the existence of the registered design right does not stop the design also being eligible for copyright protection.

He authored many pamphlets and books and was a lifelong pursuer of religious and mystical questions and visions, being particularly involved with spiritualism and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as well as the quest for the Holy Grail of Arthurian Legend and founded the Silent Minute campaign, both of which were followed internationally. Some of his visions have been accepted by some people as true. Late in life he resuscitated the Trust running the Chalice Well. The musician and actor Edward Tudor-Pole is a grandson. Biography Born and raised Wellesley Tudor Pole was raised with stories of elders and understandings of French kin Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk and English and Welsh kin Owen Tudor. Pole was born 23 April 1884, in Weston-super-Mare, son of Thomas Pole and Kate Wansborough. Pole was confirmed in the Anglican Church but the family understood this to mean the Broad church which had liberal respect for many religious ideas and of being uncritical of various apparent contradictions. His father was interested in Fabian socialism, theosophy, (probably Boehmian Theosophy the Garden city movement and the whole family were involved in Spiritualism. Kate claimed the Tudor ancestry. Pole later wrote of being unprepared for going to boarding school and had a child's visions and awareness of stories of reports of psychics. He reported school was a terrible experience with bullies and brutes. His sister described him as having a difficult childhood, not understood. At 11 years of age he felt relatively independent of family - \\"I am not a chattel\\" he recalled remarking. A rich elder friend Robert McVitie whom he felt as a kindred spirit quietly offered his parents to adopt him at age 14,(1898) but was denied, for which Pole later felt would have made a much better circumstance. Nevertheless at the age of 20, instead of going to college, he found himself managing director of the family business in 1904. Glastonbury and the cup Pole's life of experiencing visions took its first lasting step forward in 1902. That year he had a serious illness with some kind of vision. Whether that experience or another, he also later claimed having vivid dreams of being a monk at Glastonbury which inspired a strong enough interest for him to visit there that year and had further experiences that led to further trips \\"to gain inspiration\\" and spoke of it as a pilgrimage. In light of later developments it may be interesting to take note of Thomas Breakwell who died in Paris in 1902. Ultimately a cup was found about which there was much inquiry and news coverage. Pole and his assistants recounted the whole affair as they knew it before a group in July 1907 including Archdeacon of Westminster Basil Wilberforce saying \\"He may be deluded himself but one thing is perfectly certain, that he is not going to attempt to delude you.\\" In the early 20th century there was a porous relationship between liberal Christianity and esoteric or spiritualist ideas, eastern philosophies, social causes, and eastern religions. Over 40 \\"high status\\" individuals were at this meeting to discuss the cup and Pole's and assistants experiences. These 40 can be thought of as a spectrum of interests in this milieu inside and outside mainstream Christianity when they met - some of them leaders in that discourse of ideas like Pole who can be summed up as a centerpiece of a 'Celtic' network (in the sense of Celtic by connotation and reputation, though not history,) and Albert Basil Wilberforce who was a leader among the more Christian elements though with clear proclivity to associate with other kinds of religiosity. The story was recounted for the group. In later 1904 Pole had a feeling of a pending discovery to be made in Glastonbury that \\"would link the founder of the Christian faith with modern leaders of Christian thought\\" and left word to watch for such a discovery with the Roman Catholic College priest there. \\"Pole was inspired by the idea that a pre- Christian culture had existed in Ireland which had extended itself to Glastonbury and Iona, and which was the repository of an authentic Western mystical tradition, the true roots of spiritual life in the West.‚Ä¶ Still, his pursuits also blended identification with the 'mystic East', with interest in Hermeticism, Theosophy and Spiritualism. In some respects, Tudor Pole's pursuits mirror the activities of those promoting the 'Celtic Revival' in Ireland during this period, though a distinct alterity in their worldview is acknowledged.\\" In Pole's second visit he envisioned \\"three maidens\\" who would help in the \\"work\\" in Glastonbury and had brought his sister Katherine in on successor visits there. Then in 1905 he added two friends to the interest and trips - Allen sisters who went in early September and another 11‚Äì12 November \\\\- during the latter of which one had a vision of a woman's hand raising a cup out of a stream and returned. Then Pole envisioned a specific spot while at a business meeting in Bristol and was able to send the Allen sisters the same day to the particular spot - they had been there a couple times previous. There amidst some 3 feet of water and another couple feet of mud they found a cup but decided it was too sacred for them to handle so they washed it and left it in the water. 1 October 1906, Pole was able to send his sister on a chill rainy day to get it and brought it to their Clifton house in Bristol. This well was the \\"St. Bride's Well\\", (a reference to Saint Brigid of Kildare,) a kind of Holy well.  Pole began to consult with people about the cup but also to entertain the visionary experiences of others that appeared to link with his own and led to Pole's quest. In mid-December Pole consulted with Annie Besant (president of British Theosophy Society the next year,) as well as the British Museum and South Kensington Museum and Swedish Princess Karadjasee  who connected him with Helena Humphreys who from then was much involved with the quest. She felt it was a cup from the Last Supper and handed toward Peter which was kept by a woman attendant and then felt the cup had migrated to a European Church in between until finally at the ruins of Glastonbury. They had this meeting in January 1907. Pole also had felt something important about a \\"Church somewhere on the Continent\\" as well. Pole also consulted with A. E. Waite who confirmed it had some characteristics of the Holy Grail, details of which were linked with the legend of King Arthur in the vision of Sir Percival of it. However later in September Waite disavowed the cup as the Holy Grail itself. In fall 1906 and again in spring 1907 Pole consulted with medical doctor and collector John Goodchild who slowly unfolded his story. Goodchild claimed to have bought it in 1887, that his father had claimed it with a sense of importance, and following a vision in Paris in 1897 and the death of his father (who sent it back by courier) decided to leave it in a well in Glastonbury. Goodchild's Paris vision indicated that his 'visitor' had \\"came to you at very great danger to myself to tell you‚Ä¶\\" which may be the first indication of ideas of a threatening conditions among the discarnate. Goodchild tried to watch out for its future discovery and even brought a woman friend to the well hoping for it to be discovered. Goodchild had had visionary experiences in August/September 1906 and as a result sent Pole a letter with a drawing of one of his visions - a vision of a cup with five stars - to be passed on to whomever \\"the pilgrims who have just been to Glastonbury\\" were and was there in late September when the Allen sisters returned after their original find of the cup though he did not relate his history with the cup to them but was very enthusiastic of their find. Pole and his sister then visited Goodchild in late September but shared only part of the story. Pole never did find any confirming evidence of Goodchild's statements on the history of the cup. Of the origin, placing, and recovery of the cup, some processes and timings have been associated with Celtic and mystical thought and may have been a paradigm by which both Pole and Goodchild may have had a common framework of thinking. But the importance observed with respect to the cup was seen amidst ideas of matriarchal background of Ireland via Goodchild compared to a more Arthurian context for Pole. 23 June 1907, Pole showed the cup to the Archdeacon of Westminster who invited then visitor Samuel Clemens who remarked upon it, and then to a group of notables 20 July including George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle, Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle, Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax, Reginald John Campbell, William Crookes and Oliver Lodge, and Whitelaw Reid, who gathered at home of Basil Wilberforce. Along with reporting on the visionary experiences leading to the finding of the cup, Pole reported other visionary experiences which he claimed as prophecies. These were \\"received instructions\\" while awake and not through a seance: * There would be \\"definite tangible proof\\" connecting the cup to Jesus. * The cup will return to Glastonbury and the area would become a cite of physical and spiritual healing and advance the idea it was the place of the first touch of Christianity to the land - see Myths and legends of Glastonbury. * Pole warned of \\"a Divine outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the world‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ great intelligences‚Ä¶ preparing channels through which this Divine power, this second coming, this great outpouring of the Holy Ghost, shall be manifested,\\" which, conditionally, could be a channeled by and magnify church unity and the high position of Britain, but if not it would \\"no longer remain the great nation she is, and the centre of the world will be transferred to a very different country\\" and \\"other agencies will be found\\". And a signal event in this process and a kind of deadline for that condition of unity was going to be in 1911 when \\"those who have been watching and preparing the way for the second coming will recognize a great teacher who will be here and will be recognized by a few in that year. The great teacher will be a woman and recognized by those who are, as I say, preparing the way, by a seven pointed star that will be worn on her forehead.‚Ä¶[but] not be recognized by official Christianity‚Ä¶.\\" The prophecies were envisioning a rebirth of Christian unity among the islands of Great Britain and a rival to the Roman Catholic Lourdes site, but if unity could not be achieve another situation would be found and another country take the fore in the world. The cup became very well-known and is still commented upon in a variety of contexts.  Wilberforce accepted the cup as the Holy Grail. Pole claimed it was at one time in the possession of Jesus and provided the opportunity for a new wider religious framework in terms of respect for geography as well as a breadth of ideas which later were taken up as a theme of New Age thought. The fact that newspaper accounts validating the seriousness of the proceedings and reception of the claim is argued to fit into this being not just about a curio but about a meeting of ideas including but not dominated by differences of ideas. The meeting had been meant to be quiet and private among the group but it was published in the newspaper a week later. Indeed it was carried in the news internationally.    * Though the cup was soon understood by most to be too modern and Wilberforce's enthusiasm for it caused complications with his superiors, Wilberforce continued his associations and investigations of religious connectivity. For Pole the meeting introduced him to a higher profile of engagement with the exchange of ideas. Pole and his sisters and supporters began to host the cup in the upper room of his home in Bristol and called it \\"the Oratory\\" which is a small chapel, especially for private worship. In this period of activity around the cup various visions developed among Pole and others who became associated with it. Leslie Moore was in South Africa in March 1907 and had a vision news would come in late July of a remarkable find. She sailed for England in June and stayed with a friend, Miss Hoey, and learned of the coverage and \\"find\\" and let Pole know of her experiences before the end of July that she had had visions of papers which would give an account of the cup. She envisioned what seemed to her a large Catholic Church with a priest in red vestments when there was loud banging on the doors and people became afraid. An acolyte then escaped through a tunnel system which led to a chapel with a scroll and the cup and then he left with the cup along further tunnels coming out into a church ruin. She wrote to her friend who sent it on to Pole and he send a telegram asking her to come visit him in London. She, Miss Hoey, and Helena Humphreys gathered. There Pole identified the Church as the Church of San Sophia, a part of the Hagia Sophia complex in Constantinople. This encounter solidified Pole's sense of a quest. Another who became involved was Alice Buckton. She attended the Wilberforce meeting and then to the oratory in late September 1907, and later went on pilgrimage to see  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, then leader of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in early 1910 while Pole went that winter. Buckton went on to buy the Chalice Well in 1913 which would later host the cup. Wilberforce and Buckton were among those later close to the religion. Constantinople and the quest Initially his quest was for textual proof of the cup, but also of the mystical heritage of Christianity and a framework or gateway to engaging in a wider unity especially in Christianity but beyond too including other Celtist investigations. Thus with the mediumship inputs Pole set out for Constantinople. First trip Pole's first attempt leaving for Constantinople came at the end of August, 1907. There he gained access to the gardens around the church but was stymied by a slab of marble blocking a tunnel but then there had visions of finding a lost library of Emperor Justinian, which would be a very significant factor the rest of his life in the quest. By 1 October he began to speculate of worldly powers becoming interested in his search. Pole had left Constantinople before the Muslim observance of Ramadan which was across the mid-October into November that year. On his return and amidst crowds now visiting the oratory, the three ladies warned Pole in of his assistant while he was in Constantinople, but he didn't agree with some of the visions of the ladies which became stronger after he returned. Second trip Pole left on his second trip back to the Church of San Sophia in later 1907 in disguise and would stay into early 1908. He later described an incident he claimed of an attempted poisoning, and of attempting to murder him. He further explored tunnels but it was unsafe and turned his attention to a possible entrance along the coast. No excavation or access was allowed amidst the time and his position as a foreigner. While there he also learned of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and particularly of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Pole was \\"much impressed by the fact that Abdul- Baha could exert such an influence from within prison walls. When I returned to London I found that very little was known of the movement, and I determined to visit Abdul-Baha, ‚Ä¶ and discover for myself the secret of his power.\\" It has been claimed that he learned this from early Bah√° º√≠ Stanwood Cobb who was teaching at Robert College in Constantinople after converting to Bah√° º√≠ Faith 1906 at Green Acre. Now returned to the UK, the group or Pole decided access to the oratory was cut off from January 1908 to September 1910. More experts met about the cup late in January as well and they generally felt it was not ancient yet it was still bringing people together from east and west. Further trips were complicated by the intensifying tensions to the region: the whole situation is seen as part of The Great Game from earlier that coalesced into the Young Turk Revolution in July 1908. Early Bah√° º√≠ Sidney Sprague visiting from America met with Pole in London answering questions as well as literature he could share. Pole later also mentions reading the report of orientalist E. G. Browne meeting Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Third attempt ends at  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° In 1908 Pole left for a third attempt on the quest amidst the visions and prophecies and experiences he had had. This time he was going to start from the southern Mideast to see museums for comparable evidence about the cup but started with wanting to meet  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° who by then was in Alexandria, Egypt.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° was freed from political arrest in September. Pole later reported an anecdote from the trip. On the way to meeting  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° he had an encounter with a sheikh who thoughtfully observed a problem with imperialism: \\"A traveller walking through the streets of a town came across a house with its windows broken and its doors askew. Inside the house everything was in turmoil. He went into the house, and finding the owner, said to him, 'Your house requires putting in order, it is full of disorder. May I call my servants and put things straight for you?' The owner accepted the offer, so the traveller then called in his attendants and set the house in order. Having done this, he built a hut in the garden outside the house, and turning to the owner, said 'This is a very nice house; now it has been spring-cleaned it is in beautiful order, and I and my servants will inhabit it; you can go into the hut and live there, but I will take possession of your house and administer it in my own way and for my own ends.\\" which he then shared in 1914. Pole arrived to meet with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, and the translator for the meeting might have been Shoghi Effendi, one of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s grandsons, who acted as translators. At their next meeting  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° said Pole was to soon return instead of going forward with search, and when Pole adjusted his plans, a bit confused but willing to obey,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° asked him to bring long a package of money for a Persian student in Paris with eye trouble - without address or any specific contact information and Pole feeling the money could have been wired more efficiently than delivered by him. But Pole indeed did find him by chance after several searches failed. Pole reported he arrived home in time to avoid personal and business catastrophe. However odd this was for him, Pole was noted for his in-stride acceptance of 'miracles'. Back in the UK By 1909 Pole felt that \\"tremendous events were about to take place\\" of the \\"great onrushing of the Breath of God\\" seen as \\"this great Wave\\" that had \\"reached the border of our human consciousness and had begun to penetrate it.\\" But there was also visions of a \\"war in the Air\\" of the realm of the discarnate. He also began to speak at meetings such as at Colston Hall in Bristol in May about vegetarianism, and was elected president of the Bristol Vegetarian Society by December. In 1910 resumption of access to the cup started and Pole and the ladies assisting took the cup to the island of Iona to revive the place as a spiritual center. Pole began to collect anecdotes of visionary experiences he ultimately published in The Silent Road much later in 1960, and the article \\"The Mastery of the Citadel\\" which was published first in 1915 and then again in 1966. Pole also wrote a letter to the Christian Commonwealth on the \\"Brotherhood of Man\\" which led interest of other seekers who joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. In June Pole met Robert Felkin who later also joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as well. In June Pole couldn't make meetings of the Vegetarian Society and in August he spoke in Herefordshire on healing the body by spiritual means. About the same time Pole met Neville Meakin who was a senior member of a group spun off from the fragmentation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn who hoped Pole would become a successor heir. Meakin attended the oratory in September went on to meet with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° several times. However Meakin died in 1912 unable to finish the stages of initiation of the group for Pole and such interests for Pole, such as they were, ended. In September visitors from India involved in the Brahmo Samaj movement came to see the cup in the oratory and felt it was bringing a chance for mystical awareness across people of different beliefs. At other times the ladies associated with the cup and the oratory performed baptisms and weddings though without the labels of being priests or priestesses. Meanwhile Pole went on to meet with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° again in late 1910 in Egypt and sent a letter to Scotland with second had reports from  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° of a prediction of a World War in light of the anticipated Armageddon of the Book of Revelation and beyond to the generality of the 20th century. Writer Patrick Benham related Pole learning of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° only in 1910 through Archdeacon Wilberforce. Pole felt a healing presence and a confirmation of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° \\"as a world teacher\\" (in the words of writer Patrick Benham.) Pole went on to then have his own visions of the same ideas of this foretold conflict after returning home. Pole's mirrored vision started as a depressing foreboding starting with \\"mighty winds\\" and \\"strange‚Ä¶ perfect silence. A sound of thunder followed, so indescribable and so terrible that it seemed as if the world would be rent to pieces. The thunder passed, and the hill was bathed in quiet light, and I became aware of a mighty Presence standing beside me, full of strength and illumination.‚Ä¶(which) made me comprehend the significance of many events that were to transpire‚Ä¶.\\" Pole spoke to the London Bah√° º√≠s about  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and repeated his 1911 prophecy ideas on 31 December 1910. The Bah√° º√≠s also managed a \\"Higher Thought Center\\" in London in 1910, and a \\"Bahai Press\\" in 1911. After 1910 Pole felt he was a member of a \\"group working in Borderland (ed - between the normal consciousness of people and that of the discarnate peoples) in preparation for the descent and control of the new spiritual currents that were to leaven human thought and ideas‚Ä¶\\", which may or may not be the group that would identify the \\"great teacher\\" woman with the star.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° Across earlier 1911 there are various newspaper reports of Pole. January 1911 Pole appeared before the Bath Theosophical Society on behalf of the Bah√° º√≠s, in June at Clifton House he presided while Alice Buckton spoke at the meeting, then himself in early July on situations in Egypt, in August on the equality of women and men, and mention of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° coming in mid-September. and also had exchanged telegrams with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° while attending a theosophy summer meeting in August. Pole lived with his parents and sister at the residence. Pole presented for  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° at the Universal Races Congress in 1911. Upon  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s arrival, his translated talk was read by Pole at the City Temple Church, and also spoke at a number of theosophical meetings, and then  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° stayed at Pole's home in Bristol; the home acted as a center offering themed weekend retreats and a visit to the oratory housing the cup. Two kinds of reports exist of the visit - in one  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° went to every room and blessed it and in another he blessed the cup itself in silence, (rather differently than other blessings he offered - compare with recorded affirmations of things like Bible.) The second version is not publicized in Bah√° º√≠ works.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° visit started 27 September 1911 - and the location is known as the Clifton Guest House next to Pole's own home. A collection of records of talks and information has been published of his visits to Bristol, along with a variety of efforts across time.    Early Bah√° º√≠ Lady Blomfield's daughters and a couple of others assisted in the comfort of the guests during the visit as well as taking notes and managing appointments. Pole's biographer Gerry Fenge interprets Pole's prophecy of the \\"great teacher\\" as  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° though not a woman or with a visible 7 pointed star on his forehead. A correspondent with Fenge has interpreted the vision of a woman with stars as the divine Maiden who was guiding  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. While  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° went back to Egypt for the winter, in early 1912 Pole was again visible in some newspaper accounts. In February 1912 Pole lectured in Gloucestershire, a meeting in Bristol in May, and a Clifton House initiative in June, before going to London in early August shortly before getting married in later August, One of the Allen sisters moved away and married in April. Pole's sister Mary had married in February 1911. Pole was amidst running the Clifton Guest House 1909-1914. A talk of Pole's made the news over in America in June. In October he had thought out wider ideas of conspiracies that might be in league against him finding Christian manuscripts, the original quest. He prepared detailed ideas for returning to Constantinople but was unable to get away. And met and developed a deep friendship with Scottish businessman David Russell who himself warned Pole that he was convinced the \\"mental and other conditions\\" influenced visions and understandings of mediums and intuitive ideas one might have; a kind of \\"open-minded scepticism\\" which could be affected by senses of divided loyalties. Indeed  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° sometimes separates dreams and visions into three categories: true, interpretative, and confused. At least some of this guidance was related circa 1908 in a widely disseminated Some Answered Questions. The first do not need interpretation but depend on having, according to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in the words of Necati Alkan, \\"a heart rid of all attachment and there must not exist idle thoughts in the mind.\\" The second can be decoded for the truth, and the third only reflect \\"the strife and contention\\" of the experiencer. According to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, the work of decoding the second type is like, in Necati Alkan's words, \\"if you add any color to a white cloth, it will accept it; but if you add blue to a yellow cloth, it will become green and the truth is distorted. In order to have the true colour, one needs to remove the added colour.\\" Indeed, sometimes  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° notes such experiences can mean the opposite of what they seem. And Ricky Bradshaw, who experienced a deep near death experienced, when asked if such an experience was key to gaining enlightenment, said: \\"Having a near- death experience does not make you enlightened. It is an introduction, perhaps more a hindrance than a help!\\"  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° returned again visiting the Poles now married, after coming from America, in early January, 1913. He also spoke at more theosophical meetings in Britain. Pole had ideas that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° might travel to Russia, Turkestan and India in the coming year or so and unlikely to travel west again. Pole was with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in France in 1913 and heard him foretell of the War followed some day in the future by the Most Great Peace. His and Florence' first child Jean was born in the oratory in 1914. War time In May Pole writes of an experience of being called to help \\"frigid souls\\" who had just died (\\"drowned\\") and were lost and feeling terrorized; he wanted to get better at aiding newly dead individuals. In early July Pole had bought a ticket for Constantinople but with the brewing war the plan did go forward. In August he writes of feeling layers of the warfare \\"in the intermediary spheres\\" was ending and that the newly dead were having an easier time transitioning as if \\"‚Ä¶some great edict has gone forth‚Ä¶\\". Pole wrote of his understanding of Bah√° º√≠ ideas of Armageddon prophecy in September to another long associated with the religion \\\\- Mrs. Jane Whyte - also called a theosophist, who also hosted  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and was the receiver of the tablet Seven Candles of Unity. In November Pole published publicly about his ideas of the troubles of the War: > All nations that look upon brute force as worthy of worship must share the > blame for what has led to the present crisis. Superficially it would appear > that Germany has plunged the world into war. But if we look back into the > past few centuries we shall see that nearly all the countries of Europe are > responsible, among them Great Britain, and therefore they must all share the > responsibility for the situation now developing.‚Ä¶ We must remember that > Germany is to a large extent only attempting to copy Great Britain‚Ä¶. We > cannot afford to throw stones, but as a nation should endeavour to cultivate > a little humility.\\" And then spoke in London on the theme \\"Some Deeper Aspects of the Great War\\" and available in earlier 1915. Whatever reprieve he felt was going on in worlds of consciousness, in later 1914 Pole begins to speak of visions of 'Conflict in the Air' for the War in Heaven of the battle of St. Michael and others - terminology that he grew in use across decades \\\\- and also to write a point of view expression of the battles. These experiences were gathered from about 1915 and published in his first book Private Dowding along with what he felt were the personal experiences of that person. In March 1916 he spoke at the Higher Thought Centre in London, but felt it went badly and that he should take a vow of silence and was depressed. In March he volunteered for military service though he could have sought a release from service as he had a company that sold biscuits to the military. While thus occupied his sister Katherine was the keeper of the cup. A year later in March 1917 he felt the presence of a soldier but it wasn't a communication yet, and in August he began a process of automatic writing and this together with earlier work resulted in the book Private Dowding. The book also discussed a Bah√° º√≠-informed spiritualist paradigm of engagement with the world and of revivals of existing religions. A notebook was also begun recording experiences of being of assistance to the newly dead by giving them a mental environment to aide them in their transition. He was noted away from the Vegetarian Society meeting in June. Volunteer In September he started as an officer's candidate in the UK Marines and was assigned as a 2nd lieutenant in the 3rd company of the Cheshire Regiment. Pole participated in some meetings in Bristol in June/October 1917. In October Pole also experienced opposition from a business partner in his visibility in reporting his psychic experiences. At first he thought he was going to France but come November he knew was going to Egypt and already was anxious about the safety of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Pole's family and friends gathered in November for the send-off but also had family vision experiences where Mary led and Pole followed including that various \\"Masters\\" would speak to him and he was under 'special protection' and 'consecrated' and his family would also be protected and told by a 'master' in the discarnate world \\"‚Ä¶you are to be made known to those who serve me in the world. I am going to initiate you into great mysteries. Fail not in your task, because upon you depends the successful accomplishment of a great mission.\\" However, similar to his experience going to school, going to military training became a more intense period of suffering. He began to carry on a correspondence with social leaders who had previously been interested in his activities. His military superiors took note he gave up exemption from service, then learned he was on personal terms with superiors in the government and society and began to fawn on him somewhat - fixing things that should have been fixed but were only attended to because he was there. Initially he served with the Devons mostly on after-battle salvaging sometimes under starry skies. A conversation Pole had with a friend anticipated his death and became the basis of the Silent Minute published circa 1940. Pole was wounded in the attack of occupied Jerusalem in early December. His friend did get killed as was his aide. He had no support in the hospitalization and was a bit hysterical too. Following this Pole was assigned to Military Intelligence and soon was alerted to the threat to  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° - by the end of December was sending letters along multiple channels of concern to those with access to the government. Letter campaigns addressed concerns through secondaries to the British Cabinet which began to arrive towards the end of January. In February Pole was assigned to Allenby's office and then became Director of the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration. Several lines of actions had brought the matter to the fore by mid-February. This was confirmed from intelligence gathering in March. Orders from the Cabinet that included George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and Lord Lamington led to the order to Allenby for the protection of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and his family. Curzon had also written about the Bab√≠-Bah√° º√≠ history in Persia, and Lamington had met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Pole was promoted to Captain in April. Battle plans were worked through the summer, and Pole was in a position to also act as a host to various meetings including zionist activists though he himself was too busy with work to do much with them into June but about this time had a vision of a \\"visiting\\" discarnate doctor ministering to his sad condition and an herb was prescribed, found, and bettered him. Some of Allenby's soldiers were moved to France and Indian soldiers replaced them to which were added some planes and bombs in September: and two Ottoman armies were destroyed in the Battle at Megiddo, and through the Battle of Haifa Mysore Lancers were dispatched to protect  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and family, having entered Haifa 23 September 1918, a date still commemorated. Word of the rescue of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° spread. The experience has been novelized.For another experience related to World War I and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith see or Pole was promoted to Major in November. He told his staff to mind the Day and change in history - he was then in Jerusalem and in a little more than a week was in Haifa and then a 2.5 hour drive in a horse carriage to Akka to see  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Pole later describes being with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° at Bah√° º√≠ Shrines \\"‚Ä¶on Mount Carmel‚Ä¶ (and) within the Garden Tomb\\". He later reported an anecdote: > When I expressed my happiness that the war was over (a \\"war to end all > wars\\"), the Master looked at me with kind but sorrowful eyes and said that I > should live to witness a still greater conflict, one that would largely be > fought out \\"in the air,\\" and that it was only subsequent to this terrible > event (or series of events) that the\\" Most Great Peace\\" would dawn. Back at work, government and representatives of Jewish, Christian, and Moslem interests continued arguments which Pole would hear but in off-business hours would regularly lay down to \\"serve\\" in distant lands and casually mention it to people and phone people and to give them warnings of events. Pole became close friend of Frederick Leveaux circa 1918 and in the 1930s they explored locations of Goodchild's claim and he long held an account of Pole's trips to Constantinople. He was a Lawyer in Cairo by the end of 1918. Pole left the army in May 1919 with the OBE honor in June, and Pole wrote an article on  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° for the Palestine News which brought widespread interest locally. Back in the UK New business and interests‚Ä¶ and the quest Pole was returned to England in June. After returning home he lost or gave up the family business with some relief and he got a letter of commendation from Churchill. Another business optimistically founded that spring/summer of 1919 had the prospect he could manage journalism and commerce branches in the Mideast. In the larger sense, however, writing in December 1920, Pole felt something had 'went wrong' after the spring of 1919. The Bah√° º√≠s had already had some of the materials of, and in 1919 in New York had a grand gathering on the formal presentation of, the Tablets of the Divine Plan which were about promulgating the religion around the world and in several regions of the United States of America and not the United Kingdom, which was a much more important power in the world at the time, such as those of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland as it was then. Pole sent a letter to the convention. That Fall interest in Pole's publishing books about psychic experiences in war was waxing. But the venture of an international journalism and commerce collapsed. July 1920 Shoghi Effendi arrived in Britain with tablets from  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to Lord Lamington and Pole, though we do not have a statement what they were about. He delivered them at a reception held for his arrival. He also consulted with Pole for places to vacation to obey a request of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° during the early days of his education at Oxford. In his visions Pole believed a new war footing of tension was rising up and cutting people off from the higher worlds especially in the strife in Ireland and Russia, a drawing of inspiration of racial consciousness meant to become wider but failing, and the flow of spiritual awakening was now misdirected and then was cut off in spring 1920: for him examples of this were how things were going with President Wilson, the League of Nations, the Versailles Treaty, the Russian Revolution, and the like all resulting in a halt of the fortunes of the second coming, the dissipation of the envisioned spiritual resources and then they being halted. In 1921 Pole was acting as Secretary of the Bah√° º√≠ community in London. That summer Pole's connections led to him being involved in the process of the independence of Egypt. Shoghi Effendi learned of death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in later November at Pole's home, being found fainted next to the telegram. Meanwhile the second generation of Pole and associates working on visions and the quest was disbanded and a third generation formed this time of men: the lawyer Frederick Leveaux he encountered in Cairo, two Russian asylum seekers came with a revision on the Ouija board approach to contact with the discarnate, and they introduced Pole to a third Russian exile. Amounting to 5 they soon developed an idea that there was a mysterious sixth man to join them in the work. At the same time the group envisioned a change in an old otherworldly 'contact' and a new 'speaker' joined in the messages the group were set on decoding and working with to advance the quest in part for the lost library of materials that would revolutionize Christianity as their part of a worldwide transformation to be achieved. In March 1922 Shoghi Effendi gathered senior Bah√° º√≠s from multiple countries in Haifa to discuss the near term development of the religion. Pole was there. The initial question was whether to directly seek electing the Universal House of Justice which the newly appointed head of the religion, Shoghi Effendi, decided firmly could not happen until there was more work establishing local and national spiritual assemblies first. The separation between Pole and the community was over exactly the question of a movement uniting and rejuvenating the existing religions vs being another religion with its own organization may begin here. Pole declined inclusion on ballot for the election of the Local Spiritual Assembly of London after conversations with Shoghi Effendi and thought he could serve the interests of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and the Bah√° º√≠s to act as a non- Bah√° º√≠ though in some ways Bah√° º√≠s were perhaps more reluctant to work with him. Pole never criticized the religion or its institutions. Another strain was the fact that Pole was also a firm believer in reincarnation which if defined as the literal return of individual personalities is against the teachings of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° noted as early as 1908 in Some Answered Questions, but this belief also raised questions as Pole soon believed as well: that enemies in the \\"beyond\\" could force a discarnate to reincarnate, and the 'opposition' included supposed ancient beings who had been reborn many times which seems to go against the whole paradigm of why reincarnation is claimed to exist. While the group worked these issues this mysterious sixth member of the group remained unfound over the years and the promised avenues of advancement dried up leaving the 'guides' with a poor reputation in the group. Pole did put together the resources for another trip to Constantinople on the quest in April which investigated the seaside entrance to a possible hidden library but returned home unsuccessful by the end of May. Through these Russian exiles from 1922 Pole began an \\"Appeal\\" on behalf of the Russian Clergy in the face of Bolshevist opposition of the Soviets and continued for 12 years. * In 1925 he visited Bath. He set up an import/export business but seemed to succeed more connecting with people in all kinds of walks of life and trying to resolve problems, but was not an economic success. Personally the stress of these setbacks and perhaps an illness made him bedridden with a paralyzing condition in later 1923. His economic situation was reduced to surviving by wits instead of returns from investments and occasionally borrowing money from friends by spring of 1924. The quest was put on hold. Then things began to turn around. There was an Algerian paper investment in later 1924, and in 1925 he entered into business in Italy which then became a successful land management company across a wide area around Gargano Italy. There he also visited the Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo which was associated with archangel Michael, and Roman Catholic Padre Pio, and was under threat of malaria. There he worked with among others Mussolini in his early days. Pole's father died in late summer 1926. In December Pole spoke to Spiritualist group in London, and to another group the next year in March. New era of projects and the Silent Minute In time Pole tried to advance three centers of spiritual importance across Britain and Ireland: Glastonbury (associated with Arthurian legend and early Christianity in Britain) Scottish Iona and an as yet uncertain island of Ireland. These three would be a \\"heart\\" to be in relation to the \\"brains\\" of London, Edinburgh and Dublin. The cup was taken to Glastonbury and Iona. At times Pole and Goodchild and others maintained links with people in the Golden Dawn group and a chance to lead a particular subgroup which didn't come about. Indeed a triad of centers of Bah√° º√≠ development did form in the early days of the religion in Britain. In 1928 Pole undertook going to pilgrimage sites for St. Michael in Europe following interest of Rudolf Steiner connecting Glastonbury and Tintagel. In 1930 Pole was in a business meeting. Some of his Russian contacts themselves developed problems with the Russin clergy from 1930. In 1931 Pole's quest involved some archeology activity but was not successful. The published biography of Pole largely ends coverage in 1931 so the summarization of Pole's visions and experiences currently ends and the available coverage shifts to more of his public engagements and works. In 1933 Pole is still visible on behalf of the situation of the Russian clergy, and again in 1935, and in his own words in 1936 with the struggles of what life was like in Russia instead of the propaganda. That year he also founded the company Wellesley Holdings 1936 for waste conversion which was and sold in the 1940s. In 1937 he published on the \\"shadow doctor\\" he felt had been assisting him for years. Rejuvenated connection with Bah√° º√≠s In 1938 Pole was included in efforts of incorporation of National Spiritual Assembly of Great Britain, the national institution managing the community, and felt free to associate and support Bah√° º√≠s in the 1940s. Pole is next found in newspapers in 1940 with the beginning of the promulgation of the Silent Minute,  and co-wrote The spiritual front, an issue each one of us must face fairly and squarely with Waldron Smithers. Pole began a consideration of what became called the Silent Minute from 1917 and its success was mentioned by a Nazi official in 1945. And some of that movement went on to become the Lamplighter movement. None of which was commented on by Bah√° º√≠s. The call for the Silent Minute expanded and continued.    and he toured giving talks too. Pole had been present at the centenary celebrations of Bah√° º√≠s in London in 1944 though still stressing his view that it was a movement vs a separate religion following reconnection that Shoghi Effendi advised in 1943 though Pole's connection with two early regional leaders in zionist growth of Palestine didn't bother Shoghi Effendi. Bah√° º√≠s were somewhat visible in newspapers that spring and alittle in the fall while Pole was visible in the fall with the restyled wording of the \\"Big Ben Minute\\" for the Silent Minute, and with an offer to seek to repair the Liberty Bell which did not get received well. In 1945 Pole maintained contact with the Bah√° º√≠s and who appeared to accept his position of \\"assist the Cause as a non-member\\" while Pole continued publicly engaged in the Silent Minute/Big Ben Minute work even after the war. * Pole was on the RMS Queen Elizabeth that birthed in America in April 1947 but did not embark onto shore. The paperwork listed him as a first-class passenger and as an industrialist born in Somerset. Also, a passport was not listed. He set up an alternative health care services and pharmacy business in 1948. The final known mention from Shoghi Effendi came in 1949 when he advised the Bah√° º√≠s in Britain invite Pole to their events and schools and \\"show utmost consideration\\" of him. In 1950-51 Pole wrote two articles mentioning the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in an attempt at a scholarly psychic investigations journal. In the first he states: > The primary mission of the Baha'i Faith is to enable every adherent of an > earlier World-Faith to obtain a fuller understanding of the religion with > which he stands identified and to acquire a clear apprehension of its > purpose, which, in our modern world, will involve the emergence of a world- > community, the consciousness of world-citizenship and the founding of a > universal civilization and culture. > > This Revelation is now beginning to demonstrate its right to be recognized > not as one more religious system added to the conflicting creeds which for > so many generations have divided mankind, but rather as a restatement of the > eternal verities underlying all the religions of the past, as a unifying > force instilling into the adherents of these religions a new spiritual > vigour, and unfolding to their eyes the glorious destiny that awaits the > human race. Both parts of this are close paraphrases of Shoghi Effendi's statements. First in The World Order of Bah√° ºu'll√°h written in 1932: \\"Its declared, its primary purpose is to enable every adherent of these Faiths to obtain a fuller understanding of the religion with which he stands identified, and to acquire a clearer apprehension of its purpose.\\" And second in a statement to the UN in 1947: \\"‚Ä¶this Faith is now increasingly demonstrating its right to be recognized, not as one more religious system superimposed on the conflicting creeds which for so many generations have divided mankind and darkened its fortunes, but rather as a restatement of the eternal verities underlying all the religions of the past, as a unifying force instilling into the adherents of these religions a new spiritual vigor, infusing them with a new hope and love for mankind, firing them with a new vision of the fundamental unity of their religious doctrines, and unfolding to their eyes the glorious destiny that awaits the human race.\\" Pole further comments that the pictures of Bah√° ºu'll√°h \\"give a very poor impression of the stature and dignity of this great being\\" and felt much the same about  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° though he carried a picture of him on his person every day. Of Abdu'l-Bah√° he said: \\"one would instinctively refer to a sense of universalism, permeated with the spirit of deep, loving kindness. Whatever the topic under discussion might be - ranging from religion to the weather, from sunsets to the flowers, from ethics to personality, Abdu'l-Baha always struck the universal note, the note of oneness as between the Creator and all His creation, great or small.\\" In the second article he wrote recalled the anecdotes of being sent to Paris and some details though also that the details are from long ago memories and might have errors. Other projects In 1951 Pole cowrote Prince of Heaven, Captain of the Angelic Hosts about St. Michael. This was also the year his wife Florence died shortly before they both moved to Hurstierpoint, Sussex. Pole was still identified with the Big Ben Minute in 1951, and in diplomatic circles in 1953. In 1954 his son David began to be mentioned, as well as Pole's support for the stances of President Eisenhower, and the work of Pole in the Big Ben Council and its observance the next years. By around then and probably earlier period Pole joined the Fairy Investigation Society, a semi-secret occult group devoted to collecting evidence and information about the existence of fairies, as well as to organize documented instances of fairy sightings. One of Pole's books, The Silent Road was published in 1960. Later decades involvements In 1958-9 Pole and a group of investors bought the Tor School, and previous Chalice Well lands established by Alice Buckton in 1913, as a replacement and migration of the enthusiaism of original Bride's Well with a substitute \\"well\\". Buckton had died in 1944 but her inheritors could not sustain the establishment. Pole re-cast the investment as a Trust with support by subscribers termed \\"companions\\" to allow visitors free access to further the aims of claiming Christianity in Britain was based on Joseph of Arimathea coming to the island and his own feeling close to monastic Roman Catholic orders. The process of this new founding made news starting in 1958. Meanwhile mention of his beliefs in prayer and war was called to mind in 1962 as well as the comment of a Nazi official. In 1965 he wrote A man seen afar with the assistance of Rosamond Lehmann about the life of Jesus Christ through his visionary experience, and still trying to make sure Winston Churchill was being remembered for the Silent Minute. In 1966 work relative to the Chalice Well was more in the news. Though it took years, Writing on the Ground was published responding to requests from Bah√° º√≠s and remembered  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° - and continuing to underscore Pole's claim that Abdu'l-Bah√° had envisioned it as a movement and not a religion; as one's own commitment to the \\"spiritual path\\". It was published in 1968. Pole and comments about Pole were in the news in 1968, and 1969. In these last years of his life Pole came to a metaphorical understanding of the cup: \\"Half a century ago, in the Women's Quarter of Glastonbury, form the depths of the Well of St. Bride, a Cup was brought out into the light of day. This vessel is the symbol of the heavenly and eternal Grail, the Chalice of Christ, the Promise of the Future.\\" Pole died 13 September 1968, after suffering from cancer and often in pain at his home in Hurstpierpoint, Sussex. Pole was cremated and his ashes dispersed at a garden of the Chalice Well in Glastonbury. Review and legacy Pole has been seen in a number of contexts. For one he is seen as a progenitor of the New Age development as one of the \\"contingent collectivities\\" and \\"emblem\\"s which congealed more in the later 1960s with and after Pole's death, as well as being part of the Celtic revival, Theosophy and esotericism of Glastonbury. and in general the theme of Irish Celticism and Pole's work in it has been explored as a de-colonialization theme out of a Catholic/Protestant dynamic which then was influenced by Indian philosophy and Theosophy and origin stories of the Irish peoples though the specific ideas of these varied from Pole's own. \\"Tudor Pole considered himself 'a Universalist', belonging to 'the Schools of Mysteries', 'conversant with the tenets of the world's philosophies and religions'\\" \\"Tudor Pole and his immediate associates 'felt they had inaugurated the Church of the New Age, a church in which woman was in the ascendant and Bride, the Celtic embodiment of the Universal Feminine, was restored and harmonized with a mystical understanding of the Christian faith'.\\" He has been described as a \\"bricoleur\\" creating new forms from older ideas. Clearly he had a relationship with the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. He has been seen as central to one of the three initial networks of contacts amounting to communities for the Baha'i Faith in the UK - London, the Celtic/Mysticism of Pole and others, and the Manchester groups. And grandson William, Pole's grandson, is a recognized Bah√° º√≠. Pole had a \\"long career\\" in applying spiritualism on Christianity, and consistent held priority of Jesus. It is unclear when or if in multiple conversations, but Pole also remarked that he had shared with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° that he understood Jesus to have manifested the \\"Christ principle\\" more than any other person and he felt encouraged by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° to not give up on the Christian community but to strive to bring the Bah√° º√≠ principles to it as given by Bah√° ºu'll√°h. \\"It was made clear that the Baha'i Revelation had dawned to bring new light and truth into the world as a leaven for all Faiths and all mankind, and was not to be considered as just one more religious organisation or sect.\\" But Pole maintained a Christian-centricness sense of priority. Pole visions had been widely accepted generally partly because he was seen as sincere with integrity, and also consistently \\"normal\\" rather than putting on airs and sometimes provided enough detail about visions related to friends that they were convinced by the details. Pole lacked recognition of the Bah√° º√≠ appreciation of Mohammed, the B√°b, and the claims of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, and a fundamental misunderstanding about station of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as Bah√° º√≠s understand these things. Lil Osborn says he \\"discovered the Baha'i Teachings through his Quest, not the other way around.\\" Pole held that  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° had opposed development of a new religion but refused to take part in any criticism of the institutions of the religion. Writer Patrick Benham takes it further stating Bah√° ºu'll√°h taught \\"not a new religion, but the initiation of a force to unify existing belief-systems, pointing to the divine origin of every faith.\\" Pole was a trusted senior in the area while Shoghi Effendi was in London, and held in high esteem among Bah√° º√≠s in UK and Haifa. However this process of distinguishing the Bah√° º√≠s as a religion was not a matter of a secret teaching of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° as was common in other institutions of mystics, a kind of practice Pole was aware of among them. Pole considered himself as a trusted insider who would know of any secret teaching. Instead, Bah√° º√≠s see this as just the application of the principle of gradualism and not dictating belief in Pole's case. During his lifetime Bah√° º√≠s did not have to give up membership in other churches, and  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° himself regularly attended local mosque services in Palestine. Yet about 1940 another Bah√° º√≠, Terah Cowart Smith, was questioned by rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise who felt he knew  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° well, asking why in the early days Bah√° º√≠s didn't give up such affiliations and that changed. She reviewed the history of religious institutions - \\"Each dispensation requires a new agency to establish its separate and independent character‚Ä¶. So we wouldn't expect that in the New Bah√° º√≠ Era any of the former agencies could serve this major function.‚Ä¶ For God's purpose for the time in which we live is the establishment of unity of all the people of the world.‚Ä¶ In Bah√° º√≠ devotional services the Scriptures of all the World Religions have a part.\\" Bah√° º√≠ institutions have recognized Pole's specific contribution to the rescue of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Pole's part in his visit to Britain both times has also been the object of some note among Bah√° º√≠s and Pole's main biographer and a documented correspondent have seen it as the fulfillment of one of Pole's own prophecies. Bah√° º√≠s mentioned his book Writing on the Ground in 1969, and have collected Bah√° º√≠ mentions of his online. In succeeding decades Pole's views and writings have appeared and reappeared in newspapers, the social media of the day.  In 2009 a series of articles of his work were republished in Canada through his foundation. * More materials and references have appeared on the internet.      * Among Pole's greater achievements late in life was the rescue of the Chalice Well in Glastonbury near a decade before his passing and through he never lived in the town.

He is currently manager of non-league side Brigg Town. Career Daniel joined his local club Hull City on schoolboy forms in 1969, becoming an apprentice in 1971, and finally turning professional in September 1973. He played five seasons at Boothferry Park in the Second Division. He played seven times for the England Under 21 side while with Hull, making his debut on 27 April 1977 in a 1‚Äì0 win over Scotland U21 at Bramall Lane. In May 1978, he was transferred to First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers for a fee of ¬£182,000. Here, he was converted from a full-back into a defensive midfielder and won a League Cup winners' medal in 1980, gaining an assist in the goal that defeated Nottingham Forest. In total, he made 194 appearances for the Midlands club, scoring 16 times. In May 1984, he moved to NASL side Minnesota Strikers, returning to England in August that year, costing Sunderland ¬£15,000. He played in the 1985 League Cup Final for Sunderland, this time picking up a runners-up medal. In November 1985, Daniel moved to Lincoln City and was appointed player-manager in March 1987. He failed to stop Lincoln sliding down the Fourth Division, with the club becoming the first to suffer automatic relegation to the Conference at the end of season after losing their last game away to Swansea City. Lincoln had been in seventh place and in a play-off position in the previous January. He resigned in May 1987 and in July that year joined Burnley as a player. Whilst at Burnley he played against his former club Wolves in the 1988 Football League Trophy Final at Wembley, collecting a runners up medal. He left Burnley and league football in 1989, joining North Ferriby United. Non- league management He was manager of North Ferriby United between 1990 and 1993. He later managed Pontefract Colleries, Winterton Rangers and Denaby United before being appointed manager of Goole in November 2000 (from where he was sacked in September 2001Goole looking for new manager). He later returned to manage Pontefract, but resigned in December 2003.Daniel leaves Collieries Winterton Rangers In November 2004 he was appointed manager of Winterton Rangers for a second time, his first match in charge being the Northern Counties East Football League Division One 2‚Äì2 home with Lincoln Moorlands on 17 November 2004. He guided the club to promotion, as runners-up to Parkgate, in the 2006‚Äì07 season and then to be champions of the Northern Counties East League Premier Division the following season when they also won the league cup. Injuries hampered the club during the 2008‚Äì09 season but they still managed a creditable fifth place in the league whilst also reaching the league cup semi final and Lincolnshire County Senior Trophy final and a League Cup semi final and County Cup Final. Despite this, Daniel elected to leave the club at the end of the season. Ossett Town He was appointed manager of Ossett Town in December 2009, with the club achieving its first point in five games in his first league match in charge - a 2‚Äì2 draw at Kendal Town on 5 December 2009. However, after just nine matches in charge, with a 3‚Äì0 home victory over Durham City on 6 February 2010 being his solitary victory and the club seven points adrift of safety, Daniel resigned from the post following a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Worksop Town on 6 March 2010.

GRAPES-3 is designed to study cosmic rays with an array of air shower detectors and a large area muon detector. It aims to probe acceleration of cosmic rays in the following four astrophysical settings. These include acceleration of particles to, (i) ~100 MeV in atmospheric electric fields through muons, (ii) ~10 GeV in the Solar System through muons, (iii) ~1 PeV in our galaxy, (iv) ~100 EeV in the nearby universe through measurement of diffuse gamma ray flux. The GRAPES-3 is located at N11.4o, E76.7o, 2200m above mean sea level. The observations began with 217 plastic scintillators and a 560 m2 area muon detector in 2000. The scintillators detect charged particles contained in extensive air showers produced by interaction of high energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere. At present the array is operating with ~400 scintillators that are spread over an area of 25,000 m2. The energy threshold of muon detectors is 1 GeV. Objectives Study of # The origin, acceleration and propagation of >1014 eV cosmic rays in the galaxy and beyond. # Existence of \\"Knee\\" in the energy spectrum of cosmic rays. # Production and/or acceleration of highest energy (~1020 eV) cosmic rays in the universe. # Astronomy of multi-TeV Œ≥-rays from neutron stars and other compact object. # Sun the closest astrophysical object, accelerator of energetic particles and its effects on the Earth. Overview The first cosmic ray experiment was started in 1955 by B. V. Sreekantan by setting up cloud chambers that heralded the beginning of research at the Cosmic Ray Laboratory (CRL) in Ooty. The next decade witnessed a variety of experiments involving high energy interactions and extensive air shower studies in this laboratory. The world's largest multiplate cloud chamber was operated here as part of an air shower array and significant results on the high energy nuclear interactions and cores of extensive air showers were obtained. A triple set-up comprising an air Cherenkov counter, a multiplate cloud chamber and a total absorption spectrometer was operated in the early seventies to study the differences in the characteristics of interactions with nuclei of protons and pions in the energy range 10-40 GeV. This enabled the time structure study of nuclear active components of air showers and led to the discovery that the nucleon- anti-nucleon production cross-section considerably increases with energy. In continuation of the work on cosmic ray research at CRL, GRAPES-1 experiment was upgraded in various stages to GRAPES-2. However, due to the technical and administrative problem in its further expansion, a new experiment was set up at the RAC site 8 km from the old site which is called GRAPES-3. The GRAPES-3 experiment at present is operating with ~400 (each 1 m2) plastic scintillator detectors with a separation of 8 meters, to record the density and arrival time of particles in cosmic ray showers, and in continuous operation. At present, GRAPES-3 array is the highest density conventional EAS array in the world, and also, this experiment associated with a huge 560 m2 area tracking muon detector, is also the largest area tracking detector anywhere. Results Several results have recently been obtained from the GRAPES-3 experiment on a variety of topics, a few of which are listed below. * Measurement of primary composition in the energy 50 TeV - 1 PeV overlapping with direct measurements * Precision measurements of Forbush decrease events including rigidity dependence of its amplitude * Measurement of turbulent magnetic field in the shock-sheath region in the Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) by using multi-rigidity muon data * Precision measurement of the solar diurnal anisotropy and its higher harmonics including its rigidity dependence * Precision measurement of the density gradient of cosmic rays in the solar system by probing Swinson flow * Precision measurement of the anti-correlation between changes in solar wind velocity and cosmic ray intensity * Measurement of the electrical potential, size and height of a thundercloud, which broke the existing record.

He was not a poor man; he simply preferred a life of travelling the country by train to sitting at home. In his memoir The Ways of the Hobo, Livingston admitted that he was uneducated, but began his self-education at the age of 35. He has been lauded by many American historians as the King of the Hoboes and has followings all over the U.S. Livingston wrote 12 books on travelling the hobo way. His books brought attention not only to the state of the homeless in America, but also to the excitement and benefits of travelling the country for amusement. He lived and published his books in Erie, Pennsylvania, and Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania. He described Cambridge Springs in The Ways of the Hobo as an \\"idyllic,\\" \\"delightful\\" and \\"charming\\" summer resort town known for \\"the medicinal properties of its numberless gushing springs\\" which he chose as his headquarters to find \\"a brief respite from the hardships of the Road\\" after the hobo lifestyle brought him \\"dangerously close to the verge of a mental and physical collapse.\\" As a result, Cambridge Springs became a \\"veritable 'Mecca' to chronic hobos.\\" There were many hobos who imitated Livingston and claimed the moniker A-No.-1. Due to this, Livingston was known to travel with a scrapbook of his journeys (which included a personalized note from President William Howard Taft and an autograph from Theodore Roosevelt), copies of his books, and always two $50 bills.source In a rarity among hobos of his time, Livingston did not smoke or drink, and was known to always dress well and be exceptionally clean. The year after the death of author Jack London, Livingston published a memoir in which he described their cross-country adventures together during the late 19th century. According to Livingston, the \\"keen and penetrating\\" 18-year-old London had tracked him down and was \\"faithfully acting the role of the dog who adopted his master.\\" The book, titled From Coast to Coast with Jack London, became the basis for the movie Emperor of the North (1973), directed by Robert Aldrich. During his later life, he continued to roam the country, but he became a lecturer warning families and children against tramp life. \\"I began out of necessity, continued because I loved the life, and now because I know nothing else,\\" he said. He died in 1944 in Houston, Texas. While having a grave marked \\"A-No.1 At rest at last\\" in a Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania cemetery, his actual body was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery outside of Erie.

The unit HQ was based in Sarsfield Barracks Limerick (HQ + 2 platoons), and it also had elements based in Collins Barracks (Cork) (2 platoons). History Previous 3rd COE crest From 1959 to 2005, the company was part of the Forsa Cosanta Aituil and known as the 3rd COE. It was decommissioned and replaced on 1 October 2005 with the integration of the Irish Defence Forces and the restructure of the Irish Army Reserve under the RDF. The Unit was stood down in late 2012 as part of the RDF reorganisation. Roles The 31st COE fulfilled the Combat Engineer role within the 1st Southern Brigade RDF. The 31st COE maintains specialist‚Äôs skills were in line with their PDF counterparts.  Mobility  This involves improving the ability of friendly forces to move around the battlefield. The 31st COE fulfills this role by maintaining skills necessary for the; * breaching and clearing of minefields * gap & river crossing (infantry & vehicular bridge deployment) * obstacle clearance (including use of explosives for obstacle reduction and provision of alternative access or egress points in the urban environment) Counter Mobility The aim of counter mobility operations is to reduce the ability of enemy forces to move around the battlefield. The 31st COE has the capability to; * destroy bridges or buildings * render roads or areas impassable to tanks * create substantial roadblocks to deny roads to both infantry and mechanised enemy * create extensive defensive obstacles ranging from barbed wire entanglements to defensive anti-tank minefields Survivability To improve the survivability of defensive positions the 31st COE can strengthen existing fortifications and supplement them with defensive trench systems, machine gun bunkers, mortar positions, etc... Other roles In addition, the 31st COE can deploy in the Battlefield Services role.

After the Armistice of Cassibile the Italian garrison on the Greek island Leros was strengthened by British forces on 15 September 1943. The battle began with German air attacks on 26 September, continued with the landings on 12 November, and ended with the capitulation of the Allied forces four days later.  Background  The island of Leros is part of the Dodecanese island group in the south-eastern Aegean Sea, which had been under Italian occupation since the Italo-Turkish War. During Italian rule, Leros, with its excellent deep-water port of Lakki (Portolago), was transformed into a heavily fortified aeronautical and naval base, \\"the Corregidor of the Mediterranean\\", as Mussolini boasted. The island was base for some Italian naval units; specifically, in September 1943: * 4¬™ Squadriglia Cacciatorpediniere (4th Destroyer Flotilla) with the sole destroyer ; * III Flottiglia Mas (third MAS Flotilla) with two motor torpedo boats and six MAS; * XXXIX Minesweeper Flotilla with eleven boats; * nine minor units, seven merchant ships, two minelayers (Azio and Legnano) and three Italian-built Marinef√§hrprahm of German project. After the fall of Greece in April 1941 and the Allied loss of the island of Crete in May, Greece and its many islands were occupied by German and Italian forces. With the Armistice with Italy on 8 September 1943 however, the Greek islands, which were seen as strategically vital by Churchill, became reachable for the first time since the loss of Crete. The United States was skeptical about the operation, which it saw as an unnecessary diversion from the main front in Italy. This was confirmed at the Quebec Conference, where it was decided to divert all available shipping from the Eastern Mediterranean. Nonetheless, the British went ahead, albeit with a severely scaled-down force. In addition to that, air cover was minimal, with the U.S. and British aircraft based in Cyprus and the Middle East, a situation which was to be exacerbated by the withdrawal of the American units in late October in order to support operations in Italy.  Prelude   Initial Allied and German moves  After the Italian government had signed an armistice, the Italian garrisons on most of the Dodecanese either wanted to change sides and fight alongside the Allies or just return to their homes. The Allies attempted to take advantage of the situation, but the Germans were ready. As the Italian surrender became apparent, German forces, based largely in mainland Greece, were rushed to many of the major islands to gain control. The most important such force, the Sturm-Division Rhodos swiftly neutralised the garrison of Rhodes, denying the island's three airfields to the Allies. By mid-September, however, the British 234th Infantry Brigade under Major General F. G. R. Brittorous, coming from Malta, and SBS and LRDG detachments had secured the islands of Kos, Kalymnos, Samos, Leros, Symi, and Astypalaia, supported by ships of the British and Greek navies and two RAF Spitfire squadrons on Kos. The Germans quickly mobilised in response. Generalleutnant Friedrich-Wilhelm M√ºller, the commander of the 22nd Infantry Division at Crete, was ordered to take Kos and Leros on 23 September. The British forces on Kos, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel L.R.F. Kenyon, numbered about 1,500 men, 680 of whom were from the 1st Bn Durham Light Infantry, 120 men from 11th Parachute Battalion, a number of men from the SBS and the rest being mainly RAF personnel, and ca. 3,500 Italians. On 3 October, the Germans effected amphibious and airborne landings (Unternehmen Eisb√§r, \\"Operation Polar Bear\\"), reaching the outskirts of the island's capital later that day. The British withdrew under cover of night, and surrendered the next day. The fall of Kos was a major blow to the Allies, since it deprived them of vital air cover. The Germans captured 1388 British and 3145 Italian prisoners. On 4 October, German troops executed the captured Italian commander of the island, Col. Felice Leggio, and 101 of his officers, according to Hitler's 11 September order to execute captured Italian officers.  Allied forces  The Italian garrison of Leros numbered about 7,600 men, under the command of Captain Luigi Mascherpa.Bollettino d‚Äôarchivio USMM ‚Äì La partecipazione della Marina alla Guerra di Liberazione The vast majority of these men ‚Äì 6,065, plus an additional 697 militarized personnel ‚Äì belonged to the Royal Italian Navy, as Leros was mainly a naval base. The rest of the Italian force consisted of an infantry battalion and two heavy machine gun companies from the Royal Italian Army, and 20 Royal Italian Air Force reservists. Only about one thousand of them were first-line troops; most belonged to technical and service units, or to anti-aircraft detachments. The island's defenses included thirteen coastal batteries (armed with nineteen 152 mm guns, five 102 mm guns, and twenty 76 mm guns), twelve anti-aircraft and dual purpose batteries (armed with fourteen 102 mm guns, six 90 mm guns, and twenty-eight 76 mm guns), and several machine guns (three 37 mm, fifteen 20 mm, and thirty-one 13.2 mm). Most of these, however, were poorly protected from air assault and, accordingly, would suffer badly from Luftwaffe attacks. As for the ships, the clauses of the armistice determined that all Italian naval vessels were to head for Malta or other Allied-controlled bases, but Mascherpa persuaded the British command to allow his ships to remain in Leros, since they would be of more use there in the event of a German attack. The only aircraft available were seven outmoded CANT Z. 501 floatplanes, which would soon be destroyed by the Luftwaffe or transferred to Leipsoi. After the fall of Rhodes, some men from its garrison reached Leros, and Mascherpa assumed command of all Italian naval forces in the Aegean Sea. He also re-organized Leros' anti-aircraft defenses. On 12 September, a delegation of British officers met Mascherpa to assess the island's defenses and to inquire about what relations could be established between Italian and British troops; Mascherpa did not go too far in his replies, since the terms of the armistice were still rather vague. On the following day, more British officers arrived, including Major George Jellicoe and Colonel Turbull, who was disappointed by the state of the defences, particularly the anti-aircraft preparations. Meanwhile, the Italians made the decision to fire on any German aircraft that flew over Leros. On 13 September, the Germans made an offer of surrender with \\"honourable conditions\\", which Mascherpa refused.La nostra Guerra 1940-1945 On 17 September the small Italian garrison of Alimia, after leaving their island on board two fishing boats, reached Leros with their weapons. The influx of soldiers from Rhodes and Alimia brought the total Italian troop strength to 8,320, and on the same day the first 400 British reinforcements arrived. On 20 September Captain Mascherpa, upon hearing that British Major-General Frank G. R. Brittorous was coming to Leros, asked Supermarina (the command of the Royal Italian Navy) for advancement to the rank of rear admiral, so that he would not be junior in rank to Brittorous. This was granted. On the same day, Brittorous reached Leros with 600 more men, food and equipment (carried by a steamer, two destroyers and smaller vessels). Brittorous published a proclamation in which he stated that he was in command, and all Italian commands were subordinated to him; this immediately created frictions with Mascherpa, who had been confirmed in command of all Italian forces on Leros, as well as the civilian population, but was now subordinated to Brittorous. Both officers asked their commands for reinforcements, food and ammunitions, but little arrived. By October, the British forces on the island of Leros numbered ca. 3,000 men of the 2nd Bn The Royal Irish Fusiliers, (under Lt Col Maurice French), the 4th Bn The Buffs (The Royal East Kent Regiment) (Lt Col Douglas Iggulden), the 1st Bn The King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), and a company of the 2nd Bn Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment, the whole force under Brigadier Robert Tilney, who assumed command on 5 November. Initially, the British had planned to secure the high ground of the island's interior, but Brig Tilney insisted on a forward defence on the coastline, which had the effect of spreading his forces too thinly. The air force units detailed for this operation were not large. Apart from the troop-carrying and transport Dakotas, there were two-day and two night Beaufighter squadrons, a Wellington torpedo bomber squadron, three Baltimore and one Hudson General Reconnaissance squadrons and a detachment of Photographic Reconnaissance Spitfires. This force was based on the mainland of Africa and in Cyprus. In addition, two heavy bomber squadrons, No. 178 Squadron RAF and No. 462 Squadron RAAF of No. 240 Wing RAF equipped with a mix of Liberators and Halifaxes, and a Wing of IX United States Bomber Command took part at a later stage. The only real defensive force were two Spitfire squadron No.7 SAAF and No.74 RAF. In all, the number of aircraft used amounted to 144 fighters (single and twin-engined) and 116 heavy, medium and torpedo bombers. Of this total of 260 aircraft, 115 were to be lost.  German forces  Paratroopers board a Junkers Ju 52 bound for Leros. The German forces assembling for Unternehmen Leopard (\\"Operation Leopard\\") under the command of Generalleutnant M√ºller, comprised III./Infanterie-Regiment 440, II./IR 16 and II./IR 65 of the 22nd Infantry Division, the parachutists of I./FJR 2, and an amphibious commando company of the Brandenburg Division (1./K√ºstenj√§gerabteilung). The invasion force assembled in harbours in Kos and Kalymnos, with reserves and heavy equipment waiting to be airlifted around Athens. Two groups with Ju 87 D3 dive-bombers were available for close air support. I. Group of Schlachtgeschwader 3 flew from their base in Megara and II. Group from Argos and later Rhodos. II. Group of Kampfgeschwader 51 with Ju 88 were available for air strikes. On the night between 6 and 7 October, the Royal Navy cruisers Sirius and Penelope and two destroyers attacked and destroyed a German troop convoy in the Astypalaia channel; these troops were meant as a reinforcement to the force tasked with Operation Leopard, so the destruction of the convoy caused the operation to be delayed. Battle  Bombing and preparations  Starting on 26 September, after days of dropping threatening leaflets, the Luftwaffe unleashed continuous attacks on Leros, enjoying complete air superiority. On that day, Ju 88 bombers sank the Greek destroyer Vasilissa Olga, the British destroyer Intrepid, and the Italian MAS 534 inside the harbour of Lakki.Searle, G. W. At Sea Level Book Guild 1994 pp125-34 personal account by RNVR officer, with photographs The submarine base, the barracks of the naval base, the workshops, and four of the five fuel depots (but not the one which actually contained fuel) were destroyed; seven German bombers were shot down. Between 26 September and 11 November Leros was continuously subjected to heavy bombings (an average of four air strikes and 41 bombers per day between 26 and 30 September, and eight air strikes and 37 bombers daily between 7 October and 11 November). In addition to military objectives, also the villages and towns, especially Leros and Lakki, suffered heavy damage. 10% of coastal batteries, 30% of anti-torpedo boat batteries and 20% of anti-aircraft guns were destroyed; hospitals had to be transferred in caves. The air base was bombed and rendered useless on 27 September. On 3 October, the Italian destroyer Euro was sunk in Partheni bay; on 5 October the minelayer Legnano, the auxiliary landing ship Porto di Roma, the steamer Prode and one Italian MFP were sunk in Lakki harbour, followed on 7 October by the Italian steamer Ivorea.Wrecksite ‚Äì IvoreaRolando Notarangelo, Gian Paolo Pagano, Navi mercantili perdute, p. 392Legnano Porto di Roma On 12 October the Italian steamer Bucintoro was sunk inside a floating dry dock.Rolando Notarangelo, Gian Paolo Pagano, Navi mercantili perdute, p. 89. The Italian motor torpedo boat MS 15 was sunk by an air strike on Leros on 22 October, while MS 26 had been lost to grounding on 9 OctoberMS 26MS 15 The anti-aircraft batteries were prime targets for the bombings; they often ran out of ammunition or became fatigued from continuous firing, but the dive bombing technique used by the Stukas allowed the AA crews to foresee where bombs would fall, and to shoot at the bombers during the manoeuvre which followed the dive, when they were particularly vulnerable. The Italian battery on Mt. Patella was able to shoot down eight bombers by taking advantage of this weak point. Kalimnos had fallen to the Germans on 7 September, and three days later the batteries of Leros had started firing on that island. This continuous firing, along with the constant air strikes, wore the guns, and seriously depleted the ammunition reserves; the local command asked for more ammunitions, and the destroyer Artigliere and Velite were sent from Taranto, but most of their cargo of ammunition was unloaded during their stop in Alexandria, so only a minimal part of them was eventually delivered to Leros. In the last part of October, Italian and British submarines made several supply runs to Leros: HMS Rorqual (three), HMS Severn (three), the Italian submarines Zoea (two), Atropo (one), Filippo Corridoni (one) and Ciro Menotti (one); overall, the submarines brought to Leros 17 men, 225 tons of supplies, twelve 40 mm Bofors guns, and one jeep. Aircraft were also used for transport of supplies. Despite all efforts, ammunitions were still scarce, whereas food and medicines would last for many months. On the night between 24 and 25 October, HMS Eclipse, while carrying part of 4th Battalion, Royal East Kents, Buffs, along with HMS Petard, struck a mine and sank with the loss of 253 men; about 300 survivors of the battalion reached Leros on 30 October. On 29 October, HMS Unsparing sank the German steamer Ingeborg S. off Astypalaia.HMS Unsparing Between 1 and 6 November, while German forces were being concentrated for the attack, the German air offensive was temporarily halted. During the same period, ships and submarines brought to Leros another 1,280 men and 213 tons of supplies, including ammunition. On 3 November, German landing craft were concentrated in Laurium, and between 6 and 10 November they were transferred to Kos and Kalimnos. On 5 November, Brigadier Robert Tilney arrived in Leros and assumed command; also Major-General H. R. Hall arrived, and replaced Brittorous, who left for Alexandria (Hall would leave for Samos on the night between 11 and 12 November). Mascherpa was not forewarned of the substitution; he was asked to go to Cairo to discuss the situation on the island, but he refused, fearing that he would not be allowed to go back to Leros to lead the defense. Relations between Mascherpa and Tilney were tense from the beginning; upon arrival, Tilney stated that the Italian forces would not take part in any counterattack or have any initiative, relegating them to tasks of fixed coastal defense (with order not to abandon their positions for any reason), and put each sector of the defense under a British colonel. The British commando even asked for Mascherpa to be substituted, and Supermarina decided to replace him with Captain Dairetti, but this was never carried out due to subsequent events. On 7 November, the Luftwaffe bombings started again; over the next five days, a total of 187 German bombers carried out 40 raids over the islands, especially targeting the batteries located on the eastern part of the island (the area designated for the main landing) and those in the central and southern part (so that they would stop firing against Kalimnos), as well as the Anti-Aircraft and Coastal Defense Command (aiming to destroy coordination between the batteries) and the area of Lakki and Mt. Maraviglia, where British troops were concentrated. These last raids worsened the wear of the guns, disrupted communication routes and caused further consumption of ammunition. A British ammunition depot near Lakki was hit and blew up, causing more damage.  Landings  On 12 November 1943 at 4.30 am, after almost fifty days of air strikes, an invasion fleet landed troops at Palma Bay and Pasta di Sopra on the north-east coast. British motor torpedo boats and the Italian MAS 555 spotted the German ships between 3:00 and 3:30, but the reaction was delayed by communication problems and by uncertainty whether they were German or more British ships with reinforcements. German troops were thus able to land, and only at dawn did the situation become clear. The Italian batteries Ducci and San Giorgio opened fire and drove off a convoy of six Marinef√§hrprahme escorted by two Torpedoboote Ausland (Italian ships captured in Greece), heading for Gurna Bay. There were other landings at Pandeli Bay (where the Italian Lago battery fired on the landing convoys), near Leros town, that were heavily contested by the Royal Irish Fusiliers. The Fusiliers stopped the capture of some key defensive positions but were unable to stop the landings. In the northeastern sector, a German force of six auxiliary gunboats, two armed trawlers, three MFPs, 25 landing crafts, one steamer and five miscellaneous units, escorted by two captured Italian destroyers and two ex-Italian torpedo boats, as well as by minesweepers and motor torpedo boats. The Italian 888 battery in Blefuti sank two MFPs and damaged others, forcing them to stop the landing; the few German soldiers who had already landed were left without support and defeated, 85 of them being taken prisoner. In the central part of the island the Germans, despite counter-action, managed to create small bridgeheads and in the afternoon, after heavy fighting, they captured the Italian Ciano battery on Mount Clido. The Italian MAS 555 and 559 were also captured in Grifo Bay; MAS 555 was fired upon and destroyed by Italian batteries to prevent its use by the Germans, whereas MAS 559 was sabotaged by her crew on the following day.MAS 555MAS 559 Heavy fighting developed around the Lago battery (commanded by Sub-Lt. Corrado Spagnolo, who was killed in action), defended by its gunners and by an Italian Navy platoon sent as a reinforcement in a hand-to- hand combat.Corrado Spagnolo A British company was also sent to help, but had to withdraw after suffering heavy losses. German consolidation Wreck of a Junkers Ju 52 shot down over Leros on 13 November and salvaged by the Hellenic Air Force in 2003. Now at the Hellenic Air Force Museum The positions of the British units were spread around the island with poor communication between them. The attacking German forces had the twin advantages of local numerical superiority and air control. In the early afternoon Luftwaffe fighter-bombers machine-gunned and bombed the area between the Gurna and Alinda Bays, followed by Junkers 52s which at 13:27 dropped some 600 parachutists from the Brandenburg Division over Mount Rachi. Some German aircraft were shot down by the batteries and about half of the paratroopers were killed, but the rest of them landed safely and attacked the nearby batteries, meeting stiff resistance and suffering heavy losses. One of them, no. 211, was captured before dark, and its commander, Lt. Antonino Lo Presti, was executed. The position of these landings effectively divided the island in two, separating the Buffs and a company of the King's Own on the south side of the island from the rest of the garrison. Counterattacks during the rest of that day failed. During the night of 12/13 November more German reinforcements arrived. Counterattacks by the King's Own and the Fusiliers failed during the 13th with heavy casualties, but the Buffs on the south side of the island managed to capture 130 prisoners and reclaim some control of their area. On the same day, the two sections of the no. 763 battery were captured by the paratroopers; another Italian officer (Lt. Fedele Atella), in charge of the Alinda area, was executed after capture. Italian 47/32 mm guns were captured in the same area. The Ciano battery, attacked by German forces supported by Luftwaffe planes, resisted until all the guns were put out of action; after capture, its officers were executed. In the morning of 13 November, following a new launch of parachutists, the Lago battery was also captured. Mascherpa asked general Mario Soldarelli in Samos for reinforcements and air cover, but in vain. On the night of 14 November, British forces recaptured some batteries and positions and, supported by Italian artillery, prevented the Fallschirmj√§gers from rejoining the German landing troops; new German attacks later in the day, however, led to the capture of Alinda Bay, Grifo Bay, Mount Clidi, Mount Vedetta and Mout Appetici. On the night between 14 and 15 November the German forces invaded the town of Leros and the villages of Alinda and Santa Marina, while the destroyers Echo and HMS Belvoir landed 500 more men at Lakki, and Penn, Blencathra and Aldenham shelled German positions and sank some German landing crafts. On the same day, HMS Dulverton was sunk by the Luftwaffe while trying to bring supplies to the garrison of Leros, with the loss of 78 men. On the night of 14 November two more companies of the Royal West Kent Regiment and their commanding officer, Lt Col Ben Tarleton, from Samos landed at Portolago Bay. British counterattacks on that day were sporadic and carried out by fragmented forces, thus resulting ineffective and weakening the central sector of the island; however, with the help of two Royal Navy destroyers, it was possible to recapture the Ciano battery, taking over 230 prisoners. The fighting on the 14th and 15th was mostly inconclusive with more casualties on both sides, although a counter-attack by two companies of the King's Own succeeded in recapturing part of Apetiki. Lt Col French was killed in this attack. German forces attacked the castle; the commander of the local British platoon ordered it to be abandoned, but Italian Navy personnel instead kept defending it. On the night of the 15th the fourth company from the West Kents was landed and 170 German prisoners were taken to Samos. The Germans, on the other hand, landed an estimated 1,000 troops and artillery during that night. The defenders were left with only one tenth of their light weapons, and the German troops had reached the town of Leros and kept attacking the castle. Italian commanders asked Tilney to be allowed to have a more active part in the defense, but they were not listened to. By the evening of 15 November, the island was cut in two, and the situation hopeless. During the night Lt. Col. John Richard Easonsmith, commander of the Long Range Desert Group, was killed in action while fighting inside the town of Leros. At dawn on 16 November, the no. 306 battery was destroyed by German airstrikes; the no. 127 battery on Mt. Maraviglia was attacked by German forces but stiffly defended by its garrison, commanded by Captain Werther Cacciatori, who lost an arm. At 12:30 the German command commanded Rear Admiral Mascherpa to surrender with his Italian forces, but he refused. Surrender CWGC cemetery. Grave of an unknown British combatant, killed in 1943 during the Battle of Leros. On the morning of 16 November it became apparent to the British commander, Brigadier Tilney, that his situation was untenable; at 17:30, when German forces had nearly reached his headquarters, he decided to surrender. Mascherpa surrendered at 22:00, after reiterated requests by the Germans and even by Tilney. Some Italian units, not informed of the surrender due to problems in communications, kept fighting till 17 November. Overall, 3,200 British (201 officers and 3,000 soldiers) and 5,350 Italians (351 officers and 5,000 soldiers) were taken prisoner by the Germans. The 4th Bn, The Buffs, in their isolated position, were unaware of the surrender so did not attempt to escape; consequently nearly the whole unit was captured. As with the Buffs, only ninety men from the West Kents managed to escape from the island. The few Italian ships that were still serviceable left for Turkey or British- controlled ports. Some Italian officers were executed after the surrender; among them Cdr. Vittorio Meneghini, the commanding officer of Euro.Vittorio Meneghini On 17 November, 30 officers and 40 wounded prisoners were sent to Piraeus on board the destroyer TA15. On 21 November 2,700 prisoners, including Rear Admiral Mascherpa, were sent to Piraeus on board the steamer Schiaffino. On 7 December 3,000 Italian prisoners were transferred to Piraeus on board the ship Leda. Rear Admiral Mascherpa would be later handed over by the Germans to the Italian Social Republic; he was subjected to a kangaroo court for having defended Leros against the Germans, sentenced to death, and executed by firing squad. Aftermath The withdrawal of air support, particularly that of fighters, had sealed the fate of Leros. With no air support and heavily attacked by enemy aircraft, the three battalions had fought for five days until they were exhausted and could fight no more. The Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Ninth Army, General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, reported to the Prime Minister: \\"Leros has fallen, after a very gallant struggle against overwhelming air attack. It was a near thing between success and failure. Very little was needed to turn the scale in our favour and to bring off a triumph.\\" Everything was done to evacuate the garrisons of the other Aegean islands and to rescue survivors from Leros, and eventually an officer and fifty-seven other ranks of the 1st Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) rejoined the details in Palestine. Alanbrooke wrote that the COS meeting on 28 October \\"discussed the desirability or otherwise of vacating Leros, A very nasty problem, Middle East (Command) have not been either wise or cunning and have now got themselves into the difficult situation that they can neither hold nor evacuate Leros. Our only hope would be assistance from Turkey, the provision of airfields from which the required air cover could be provided.\\"* After the fall of Leros, which was received with shock by the British public, Samos and the other smaller islands were evacuated. The Germans bombed Samos with Stukas, prompting the 2,500-strong Italian garrison to surrender on 22 November. Along with the occupation of the smaller islands of Patmos, Fournoi and Ikaria on 18 November, the Germans thus completed their conquest of the Dodecanese, which they were to continue to hold until the end of the war. The Battle of Leros was considered by some to be the last great defeat of the British Army in the Second World War and one of the last German victories. The German victory was predominantly due to their possession of complete air superiority, which caused great losses to the Allies, especially in ships, and enabled the Germans to supply and support their own forces effectively. Brigadier Tilney's scrapping of the original defensive plan, the work of Lt Col Maurice French, aided the Germans whose tactics, including scramble landings and an audacious air assault, further confused Tilney. The whole operation was criticised by many at the time as another useless \\"Gallipoli\\"-like disaster, and the blame was laid at Churchill's door. Casualties of the Battle of Leros were as follows: * Germans ‚Äì 520 killed or missing * Italians ‚Äì 254 killed or missing * British ‚Äì 600 killed or missing, of whom 187 died in the fighting on Leros (the rest being lost at sea) * Hellenic Royal Navy ‚Äì 68 killed or missing * Civilians ‚Äì 20 killed Legacy The story formed the basis for the 1957 novel The Guns of Navarone and the successful film of the same name.

Pumping, when referring to computer systems, is an informal term for transmitting a data signal more than one time per clock signal. Overview Early types of system memory (RAM), such as SDRAM, transmitted data on only the rising edge of the clock signal. With the advent of double data rate synchronous dynamic RAM or DDR SDRAM, the data was transmitted on both rising and falling edges. However, quad-pumping has been used for a while for the front side bus (FSB) of a computer system. This works by transmitting data at the rising edge, peak, falling edge, and trough of each clock cycle. Intel computer systems (and others) use this technology to reach effective FSB speeds of 1600 MT/s (million transfers per second), even though the FSB clock speed is only 400 MHz (cycles per second). A phase-locked loop in the CPU then multiplies the FSB clock by a factor in order to get the CPU speed. Example: A Core 2 Duo E6600 processor is listed as 2.4 GHz with a 1066 MHz FSB. The FSB is known to be quad-pumped, so its clock frequency is 1066/4 = 266 MHz. Therefore, the CPU multiplier is 2400/266, or 9√ó. The DDR2 RAM that it is compatible with is known to be double-pumped and to have an Input/Output Bus twice that of the true FSB frequency (effectively transferring data 4 times a clock cycle), so to run the system synchronously (see Front side bus) the type of RAM that is appropriate is quadruple 266 MHz, or DDR2-1066 (PC2-8400 or PC2-8500, depending on the manufacturer's labeling.).

It focuses sound waves in a way that they can serve as accurate and high-speed carriers of information in many kinds of applications‚Äîsimilar to uses of laser light. Acoustic radiation (sound waves) can be emitted by using the process of sound amplification based on stimulated emission of phonons. Sound (or lattice vibration) can be described by a phonon just as light can be considered as photons, and therefore one can state that SASER is the acoustic analogue of the laser. In a SASER device, a source (e.g., an electric field as a pump) produces sound waves (lattice vibrations, phonons) that travel through an active medium. In this active medium, a stimulated emission of phonons leads to amplification of the sound waves, resulting in a sound beam coming out of the device. The sound wave beams emitted from such devices are highly coherent. The first successful SASERs were developed in 2009. Terminology Instead of a feedback-built wave of electromagnetic radiation (i.e., a laser beam), a SASER delivers a sound wave. SASER may also be referred to as phonon laser, acoustic laser or sound laser. Uses and applications SASERs could have wide applications. Apart from facilitating the investigation of terahertz-frequency ultrasound, the SASER is also likely to find uses in optoelectronics (electronic devices that detect and control light‚Äîas a method of transmitting a signal from an end to the other of, for instance, fiber optics), as a method of signal modulation and/or transmission. Such devices could be high precision measurement instruments and they could lead to high energy focused sound. Using SASERs to manipulate electrons inside semiconductors could theoretically result in terahertz-frequency computer processors, much faster than the current chips. History This concept can be more conceivable by imagining it in analogy to laser theory. Theodore Maiman operated the first functioning LASER on May 16, 1960 at Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, A device that operates according to the central idea of the \\"sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\" theory is the thermoacoustic laser. This is a half-open pipe with a heat differential across a special porous material inserted in the pipe. Much like a light laser, a thermoacoustic SASER has a high-Q cavity and uses a gain medium to amplify coherent waves. For further explanation see thermoacoustic heat engine. The possibility of phonon laser action had been proposed in a wide range of physical systems such as nanomechanics, semiconductors, nanomagnets and paramagnetic ions in a lattice. Finding materials that stimulate emission was needed for the development of the SASER. The generation of coherent phonons in a double-barrier semiconductor heterostructure was first proposed around 1990. The transformation of the electric potential energy in a vibrational mode of the lattice is remarkably facilitated by the electronic confinement in a double-barrier structure. On this basis, physicists were searching for materials in which stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission, is the dominant decay process. A device was first experimentally demonstrated in the Gigahertz range in 2009.Sonic lasers--a shot heard 'round the world . CNET.com News . By Candace Lombardi June 18, 2009 9:02 AM PDT; retrieved 29 Dec 2012. Announced in 2010, two independent groups came up with two different devices that produce coherent phonons at any frequency in the range megahertz to terahertz. One group from the University of Nottingham consisted of A.J. Kent and his colleagues R.P. Beardsley, A.V. Akimov, W. Maryam and M. Henini. The other group from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) consisted of Ivan S. Grudinin, Hansuek Lee, O. Painter and Kerry J. Vahala from Caltech implemented a study on Phonon Laser Action in a tunable two-level system. The University of Nottingham device operates at about 440 GHz, while the Caltech device operates in the megahertz range. According to a member of the Nottingham group, the two approaches are complementary and it should be possible to use one device or the other to create coherent phonons at any frequency in the megahertz to terahertz range.PhysicsWorld News: Hail the first sound ‚Äòlasers‚Äô, Feb 25, 2010; retrieved 29 Dec 2012. A significant result rises from the operating frequency of these devices. The differences between the two devices suggest that SASERs could be made to operate over a wide range of frequencies. Work on the SASER continues at the University of Nottingham, the Lashkarev Institute of Semiconductor Physics at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and Caltech. Design SASER's central idea is based on sound waves. The set-up needed for the implement of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation is similar to an oscillator. An oscillator can produce oscillations without any external feed-mechanism. An example is a common sound amplification system with a microphone, amplifier and speaker. When the microphone is in front of the speaker, we hear an annoying whistle. This whistle is generated without extra contribution from the sound source, and is self-reinforced and self-sufficient while the microphone is somewhere in front of the speaker. This phenomenon, known as the Larsen effect, is the result of a positive feedback. The analogy between a laser and a SASER device should be considered. Components of a typical laser: In general, every oscillator consists of three main parts. These are the power source or pump, the amplifier and the positive feedback leading to the output. The corresponding parts in a SASER device are the excitation or pumping mechanism, the active (amplifying) medium, and the feedback leading to acoustic radiation. Pumping can be performed, for instance, with an alternating electric field or with some mechanical vibrations of resonators. The active medium should be a material in which sound amplification can be induced. An example of a feedback mechanism into the active medium is the existence of superlattice layers that reflect the phonons back and force them to bounce repeatedly to amplify sound. Therefore, to proceed to an understanding of a SASER design we need to imagine it in analogy with a laser device. In a laser, the active medium is placed between two mirror surfaces (reflectors)of a Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer. A spontaneously emitted photon inside this interferometer can force excited atoms to decay a photon of same frequency, same momentum, same polarization and same phase. Because the momentum (as a vector) of the photon is nearly parallel to the axes of the mirrors, it is possible for photons to repeat multiple reflections and force more and more photons to follow them producing an avalanche effect. The number of photons of this coherent laser beam increases and competes the number of photons perished due to losses. The basic necessary condition for the generation of a laser radiation is the population inversion, which can be achieved either by exciting atoms and inducing percussion or by external radiation absorption. A SASER device mimics this procedure using a source-pump to induce a sound beam of phonons. This sound beam propagates not in an optical cavity, but in a different active medium. An example of an active medium is the superlattice. A superlattice can consist of multiple ultra-thin lattices of two different semiconductors. These two semiconductor materials have different band gaps, and form quantum wells‚Äîwhich are potential wells that confine particles to move in two dimensions instead of three, forcing them to occupy a planar region. In the superlattice, a new set of selection rules is composed that affects the flow-conditions of charges through the structure. When this set-up is excited by a source, the phonons start to multiply while they reflect on the lattice levels, until they escape from the lattice structure in a form of an ultrahigh frequency-phonon beam. The structure of a superlattice of semiconductor layers (AlAs, GaAs). Acoustic waves undergo amplification Namely, a concerted emission of phonons can lead to coherent sound and an example of concerted phonon emission is the emission coming from quantum wells. This stands in similar paths with the laser where a coherent light can build up by the concerted stimulated emission of light from a lot of atoms. A SASER device transforms the electric potential energy in a single vibrational mode of the lattice (phonon).A.Watson, New Sci. 1611999. The medium where the amplification takes place consists of stacks of thin layers of semiconductors that together form quantum wells. In these wells, electrons can be excited by parcels of ultrasound of millielectronvolts of energy. This amount of energy is equivalent to a frequency of 0.1 to 1 THz. Physics Normal modes of vibration progression through a crystal in 1D. The amplitude of the motion has been exaggerated for ease of viewing; in an actual crystal, it is typically much smaller than the lattice spacing. The vibration energy of the lattice can take discrete values for every excitation. Every one of this \\"excitation packages\\" is called phonon. Just as light is a wave motion that is considered as composed of particles called photons, we can think of the normal modes of vibration in a solid as being particle-like. The quantum of lattice vibration is called phonon. In lattice dynamics we want to find the normal modes of vibration of a crystal. In other words, we need to calculate the energies (or frequencies ) of the phonons as a function of their wave vector's k . The relationship between frequency œâ and wave vector k is called phonon dispersion. Light and sound are similar in various ways. They both can be thought of in terms of waves, and they both come in quantum mechanical units. In the case of light we have photons while in sound we have phonons. Both sound and light can be produced as random collections of quanta (e.g. light emitted by a light bulb) or orderly waves that travel in a coordinated form (e.g. laser light). This parallelism implies that lasers should be as feasible with sound as they are with light. In the 21st century, it is easy to produce low frequency sound in the range that humans can hear (~20 kHz), in either a random or orderly form. However, at the terahertz frequencies in the regime of phonon laser applications, more difficulties arise. The problem stems from the fact that sound travels much slower than light. This means that the wavelength of sound is much shorter than light at a given frequency. Instead of resulting in orderly, coherent phonons, laser structures that can produce terahertz sound tend to emit phonons randomly. Researchers have overcome the problem of terahertz frequencies by following various approaches. Scientists in Caltech have overcome this problem by assembling a pair of microscopic cavities that only permit specific frequencies of phonons to be emitted. This system can be also tuned to emit phonons of different frequencies by changing the relative separation of the microcavities. On the other hand, the group from the University of Nottingham took a different approach. They have built their device out of electrons moving through a series of structures known as quantum wells. Briefly, as an electron hops from one quantum well to another neighbouring well it produces a phonon. External energy pumping (e.g. a light beam or voltage) can help to the excitation of an electron. Relaxation of an electron from one of the upper states may occur by emission of either a photon or a phonon. This is determined by the density of states of phonons and photons. Density of states is the number of states per volume unit in an interval of energy (E, E+dE) that are available to be occupied by electrons. Both phonons and photons are bosons and thus, they obey Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics. This means that, since bosons with the same energy can occupy the same place in space, phonons and photons are force carrier particles and they have integer spins. There are more allowed states available for occupancy in a phonon field than in a photon field. Therefore, since the density of terminal states in the phonon field exceeds that in a photon field (by up to ~105), phonon emission is by far the more likely event.B. A. Glavin, V. A. Kochelap, T. L. Linnik, P. Walker, A. Kent and M. Henini, Journal of physics, con. series 92, PHONONS 012010, (2007) We could also imagine a concept where the excitation of an electron briefly leads to vibration of the lattice and thus to phonon generation. The vibration energy of the lattice can take discrete values for every excitation. Every one of this \\"excitation packages\\" is called phonon. An electron does not stay in an excited state for too long. It readily releases energy to return to its stable low energy state. The electrons release energy in any random direction and at any time (after their excitation). At some particular times, some electrons get excited while others lose energy in a way that the average energy of system is the lowest possible. GaAs/AlAs superlattice and potential profile of conduction and valence bands along the growth direction (z). By pumping energy into the system we can achieve a population inversion. This means that there are more excited electrons than electrons in the lowest energy state in the system. As electron releases energy (e.g. phonon) it interacts with another excited electron to release its energy too. Therefore, we have a stimulated emission, which means a lot of energy (e.g., acoustic radiation, phonons) is released at the same time. One can mention that the stimulated emission is a procedure where we have a spontaneous and an induced emission at the same time. The induced emission comes from the pumping procedure and then is added to the spontaneous emission. A SASER device should consist of a pumping mechanism and an active medium. The pumping procedure can be induced for example by an alternating electric field or with some mechanical vibrations of resonators, followed by acoustic amplification in the active medium. The fact that a SASER operates on principles remarkably similar to a laser, can lead to an easier way of understanding the relevant operation circumstances. Instead of a feedback-built potent wave of electromagnetic radiation, a SASER delivers a potent sound wave. Some methods for sound amplification of GHz-THz have been proposed so far. Some have been explored only theoretically and others have been explored in non-coherent experiments. We note that acoustic waves of 100 GHz to 1 THz have wavelengths in nanometre range. Sound amplification according to the experiment taken in the University of Nottingham could be based on an induced cascade of electrons in semiconductor superlattices. The energy levels of electrons are confined in the superlattice layers. As the electrons hop between gallium arsenide quantum wells in the superlattice they emit phonons. Then, one phonon going in, produces two phonons coming out of the superlattice. This process can be stimulated by other phonons and then give rise to an acoustic amplification. Upon the addition of electrons, short- wavelength (in the terahertz range) phonons are produced. Since the electrons are confined to the quantum wells existing within the lattice, the transmission of their energy depends upon the phonons they generate. As these phonons strike other layers in the lattice, they excite electrons, which produce further phonons, which go on to excite more electrons, and so on. Eventually, a very narrow beam of high-frequency ultrasound exits the device. Semiconductor superlattices are used as acoustic mirrors. These superlattice structures must be in the right size obeying the theory of multilayer distributed Bragg reflector, in similarity with multilayer dielectric mirrors in optics. Proposed schemes and devices Basic understanding of the SASER development requires the evaluation of some proposed examples of SASER devices and SASER theoretical schemes. Liquid with gas bubbles as the active medium In this proposed theoretical scheme,S.T. Zavtrak and I. V. Volkov, Zh. Tekh. Fiz. 67, 92‚àí100(April 1997) the active medium is a liquid dielectric (e.g. ordinary distilled water) in which dispersed particles are uniformly distributed. Means of electrolysis cause gas bubbles that serve as the dispersed particles. A pumped wave excited in the active medium produces a periodic variation of the volumes of the dispersed particles (gas bubbles). Since, the initial spatial distribution of the particles is uniform, the waves emitted by the particles are added with different phases and give zero on the average. Nevertheless, if the active medium is located in a resonator, then a standing mode can be excited in it. Particles then bunch under the action of the acoustic radiation forces. In this case, the oscillations of the bubbles are self-synchronized and the useful mode amplifies.K. A. Naugolnykh and L. A. Ostrovskii, Nonlinear Processes in Acoustics, Nauka, Moscow, (1990) The similarity of this with the Free-electron laser is useful to understand the theoretical concepts of the scheme. In a FEL, electrons move through magnetic periodic systems producing electromagnetic radiation.T. C. Marshall, Free Electron Lasers, Macmillan, N. Y.,(1985) The radiation of the electrons is initially incoherent but then on account of the interaction with the useful electromagnetic wave they start to bunch according to phase and they become coherent. Thus, the electromagnetic field is amplified. thumb|upright=1.2|Diagram of an electrically pumped SASER ‚àí The active medium is limited in a resonator by solid walls. An electromagnetic system produces a periodic electric field inducing useful acoustic mode and acoustic radiation. We note that, in the case of the piezoelectric radiators usually used to generate ultrasound, only the working surface radiates and therefore the working system is two-dimensional. On the other hand, a sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation device is a three-dimensional system, since the entire volume of the active medium radiates. The active medium gas-liquid mixture fills the resonator. The bubble density in the liquid is initially distributed uniformly in space. Since the wave propagates in such a medium, the pump wave leads to the appearance of an additional quasi-periodic wave. This wave is coupled with the spatial variation of the bubble density under the action of radiation pressure forces. Hence, the wave amplitude and the bubble density vary slowly compared with the period of the oscillations. In the theoretical scheme where the usage of resonators is essential, the SASER radiation passes through the resonator walls, which are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the pump wave. According to an example of an electrically pumped SASER,L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz, Electrodynamics of Continuous Media, Pergamon Press, N. Y. Russian Original, Nauka, Moscow (1982) the active medium is confined between two planes, which are defined by the solid walls of the resonator. The radiation then, propagates along an axis parallel to the plane defined by the two resonator walls. The static electric field acting on the liquid with gas bubbles results in the deformation of dielectrics and therefore leads to a change in the volumes of the particles. We note that, the electromagnetic waves in the medium propagate with a velocity much greater than the velocity of sound in the same medium. This results to the assumption that the effective pump wave acting on the bubbles does not depend on the spatial coordinates. The pressure of a wave pump in the system leads to both the appearance of a backward wave and a dynamical instability of the system. Mathematical analyses have shown that two types of losses must be overcome for generation of oscillations to start.G. S. Kino, Acoustic Waves: Devices, Imaging and Analog Signal Processing, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N. J. (1987) Losses of the first type are associated with the dispersion of energy inside the active medium and second type losses are due to radiation losses at the ends of the resonator. These types of losses are inversely proportional to the amount of energy stored in the resonator. In general, the disparity of the radiators does not play a role in any attempt of a mathematical calculation of the starting conditions. Bubbles with resonance frequencies close to the pump frequency make the main contribution to the gain of the useful mode. In contrast, the determination of the starting pressure in ordinary lasers is independent from the number of radiators. The useful mode grows with the number of particles but sound absorption increases at the same time. Both these factors neutralize each other. Bubbles play the main role in the energy dispersion in a SASER. A relevant suggested scheme of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation using gas bubbles as the active medium was introduced around 1995 The pumping is created by mechanical oscillations of a cylindrical resonator and the phase bunching of bubbles is realized by acoustic radiation forces. A notable fact is that gas bubbles can only oscillate under an external action, but not spontaneously. According to other proposed schemes, the electrostriction oscillations of the dispersed particle volumes in the cylindrical resonator are realized by an alternating electromagnetic field. However, a SASER scheme with an alternating electric field as the pump has a limitation. A very large amplitude of electric field (up to tens of kV/cm) is required to realize the amplification. Such values approach the electric puncture intensity of liquid dielectrics. Hence, a study proposes a SASER scheme without this limitation. The pumping is created by radial mechanical pulsations of a cylinder. This cylinder contains an active medium‚Äîa liquid dielectric with gas bubbles. The radiation emits through the faces of the cylinder. Narrow-gap indirect semiconductors and excitons in coupled quantum wells A proposal for the development of a phonon laser on resonant phonon transitions has been introduced from a group in Institute of Spectroscopy in Moscow, Russia. Two schemes for steady stimulated phonon generation were mentioned. The first scheme exploits a narrow - gap indirect semiconductor or analogous indirect gap semiconductor heterostructure where the tuning into resonance of one-phonon transition of electron - hole recombination can be carried out by external pressure, magnetic or electric fields. The second scheme uses one-phonon transition between direct and indirect exciton levels in coupled quantum wells. We note that an exciton is an electrically neutral quasiparticle that describes an elementary excitation of condensed matter. It can transport energy without transporting net electric charge. The tuning into the resonance of this transition can be accomplished by engineering of dispersion of indirect exciton by external in-plane magnetic and normal electric fields. Brillouin zones, a) in a square lattice, and b) in a hexagonal latticeThe magnitude of phonon wave vector in the second proposed scheme, is supposed to be determined by magnitude of in-plane magnetic field. Therefore, such kind of SASER is tunable (i.e. its wavelength of operation can be altered in a controlled manner). Common semiconductor lasers can be realised only in direct gap semiconductors. The reasoning behind that is that a pair of electron and hole near minima of their bands in an indirect gap semiconductor can recombine only with production of a phonon and a photon, due to energy and momentum conservation laws. This kind of process is weak in comparison with electron-hole recombination in a direct semiconductor. Consequently, the pumping of these transitions has to be very intense so as to obtain a steady laser generation. Hence, the lasing transition with production of only one particle ‚Äì photon ‚Äì must be resonant. This means that the lasing transition must be allowed by momentum and energy conservation laws to generate in a steady form. Photons have negligible wave vectors and therefore the band extremes have to be in the same position of the Brillouin zone . On the other hand, for devices such as SASERs, acoustic phonons have a considerable dispersion. According to dynamics, this leads to the statement that the levels on which the laser should operate, must be in the k-space relatively to each other. K-space refers to a space where things are in terms of momentum and frequency instead of position and time. The conversion between real space and k-space is a mathematical transformation called the Fourier transform and thus k-space can be also called Fourier space. We note that, the difference in energy of the photon lasing levels has to be at least smaller than the Debye energy in the semiconductor. Here we can think of the Debye energy as the maximum energy associated with the vibrational modes of the lattice. Such levels can be formed by conduction and valence bands in narrow gap indirect semiconductors. Narrow-gap indirect semiconductor as a SASER system The energy gap in a semiconductor under the influence of pressure or magnetic field slightly varies and thus does not deserve any consideration. On the other hand, in narrow-gap semiconductors this variation of energy is considerable and therefore external pressure or magnetic field may serve the purpose of tuning into the resonance of one-phonon interband transition. Note that interband transition is the transition between the conduction and valence band. This scheme considers of indirect semiconductors instead of direct semiconductors. The reasoning behind that comes from the fact that, due to the k-selection rule in semiconductors, interband transitions with the production of only one phonon can be only those that produce an optical phonon. However, optical phonons have a short life-time (they split into two due to anharmonicity) and therefore they add some important complications. Here we can note that even in the case of multi-stage process of acoustic phonon creation it is possible to create SASER. Dispersion relation œâ=œâ(k) for some waves corresponding to lattice vibrations in GaAs.Peter Y. Yu, Manuel Cardona, Fundamentals of Semiconductors: Physics and Materials Properties (2010) Examples of narrow-gap indirect semiconductors that can be used are chalcogenides PbTe, PbSe and PbS with energy gap 0.15 ‚Äì 0.3 eV. For the same scheme, the usage of a semiconductor heterostructure (layers of different semiconductors) with narrow gap indirect in momentum space between valence and conduction bands may be more effective. This could be more promising since the spatial separation of the layers provides a possibility of tuning the interband transition into resonance by an external electric field. An essential statement here is that this proposed phonon laser can operate only if the temperature is much lower than the energy gap in the semiconductor. During the analysis of this theoretical scheme several assumptions were introduced for simplicity reasons. The method of the pumping keeps the system electro-neutral and the dispersion laws of electrons and holes are assumed to be parabolic and isotropic. Also phonon dispersion law is required to be linear and isotropic too. Since the entire system is electro-neutral, the process of pumping creates electrons and holes with the same rate. A mathematical analysis, leads to an equation for the average number of electron-hole pairs per one phonon mode per unit volume. For a low loss limit, this equation gives us a pumping rate for the SASER that is rather moderate in comparison with usual phonon lasers on a p-n transition. Tunable exciton transition in coupled quantum wells It has been mentioned that a quantum well is basically a potential well that confines particles to move in two dimensions instead of three, forcing them to occupy a planar region. In coupled quantum wells there are two possible ways for electrons and holes to be bound into an exciton: indirect exciton and direct exciton. In indirect exciton, electrons and holes are in different quantum wells, in contrast with direct exciton where electrons and holes are located in the same well. In a case where the quantum wells are identical, both levels have a two-fold degeneracy. Direct exciton level is lower than the level of indirect exciton because of greater Coulomb interaction. Also, indirect exciton has an electric dipole momentum normal to coupled quantum well and thus a moving indirect exciton has an in-plane magnetic momentum perpendicular to its velocity. Any interactions of its electric dipole with normal electric field, lowers one of indirect exciton sub-levels and in sufficiently strong electric fields the moving indirect exciton becomes the ground excitonic level. Having in mind these procedures, one can select velocity to have an interaction between magnetic dipole and in-plane magnetic field. This displaces the minimum of the dispersion law away from the radiation zone. The importance of this, lies on the fact that electric and in-plane magnetic fields normal to coupled quantum wells, can control the dispersion of indirect exciton. Normal electric field is needed for tuning the transition: direct exciton --> indirect exciton + phonon into resonance and its magnitude can form a linear function with the magnitude of in-plane magnetic field. We note that the mathematical analysis of this scheme considers of longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons instead of transverse acoustic (TA) phonons. This aims to more simple numerical estimations. Generally, the preference in transverse acoustic (TA) phonons is better because TA phonons have lower energy and the greater life-time than LA phonons. Therefore, their interaction with the electronic subsystem is weak. In addition, simpler quantitative evaluations require a pumping of direct exciton level performed by a laser irradiation. A further analysis of the scheme can help us to establish differential equations for direct exciton, indirect exciton and phonon modes. The solution of these equations gives that separately phonon and indirect exciton modes have no definite phase and only the sum of their phases is defined. The aim here is to check if the operation of this scheme with a rather moderate pumping rate can hold against the fact that excitons in coupled quantum wells have low dimensionality in comparison to phonons. Hence, phonons not confined in the coupled quantum well are considered. An example is longitudinal optical (LO) phonons that are in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure and thus, phonons presented in this proposed system are three-dimensional. Differences in dimensionalities of phonons and excitons cause upper level to transform into many states of phonon field. By applying this information to specific equations we can conclude to a desired result. There is no additional requirement for the laser pumping despite the difference in phonon and exciton dimensionalities. A tunable two-level system Phonon laser action has been stated in a wide range of physical systems (e.g. semiconductors). A 2012 publication from the Department of Applied Physics in California Institute of Technology (Caltech), introduces a demonstration of a compound micro-cavity system, coupled with a radio- frequency mechanical mode, which operates in close analogy to a two level- laser system. This compound micro-cavity system can also be called \\"photonic molecule\\". Hybridized orbitals of an electrical system are replaced by optical supermodes of this photonic molecule while the transitions between their corresponding energy levels are induced by a phonon field. For typical conditions of the optical micro-resonators, the photonic molecule behaves as a two-level laser system. Nevertheless, there is a bizarre inversion between the roles of the active medium and the cavity modes (laser field). The medium becomes purely optical and the laser field is provided by the material as a phonon mode. An inversion produces gain, causing phonon laser action above a pump power threshold of around 7 ŒºW. The proposed device is characterized from a continuously tunable gain spectrum that selectively amplifies mechanical modes from radio frequency to microwave rates. Viewed as Brillouin process, the system accesses a regime in which the phonon plays the role of Stokes wave. Stokes wave refers to a non-linear and periodic surface wave on an inviscid fluid (ideal fluid assumed to have no viscosity) layer of constant mean depth. For this reason it should be also possible to controllably switch between phonon and phonon laser regimes. Compound optical microcavity systems provide beneficial spectral controls. These controls impact both phonon laser action and cooling and define some finely spaced optical levels whose transition energies are proportional to phonon energies. These level spacings are continuously tunable by a significant adjustment of optical coupling. Therefore, amplification and cooling occur around a tunable line center, in contrast with some cavity optomechanical phenomena. The creation of these finely spaced levels does not require increasing the optical microcavity dimensions. Hence, these finely spaced levels do not affect the optomechanical interaction strength in a significant degree. The approach uses intermodal coupling, induced by radiation pressure and can also provide a spectrally selective mean to detect phonons. Moreover, some evidences of intermodal cooling are observed in this kind of experiments and thus, there is an interest in optomechanical cooling. Overall, an extension to multilevel systems using multiple coupled resonators is possible. A representation of the two level system. We can see the induced absorption, the spontaneous emission and the induced emission Two-level system In a two level system, the particles have only two available energy levels, separated by some energy difference: ŒîŒï = E2 \\\\- E1 = hv where ŒΩ is the frequency of the associated electromagnetic wave of the photon emitted and h is the Planck constant. Also note: E2 > E1. These two levels are the excited (upper) and ground (lower) states. When a particle in the upper state interacts with a photon matching the energy separation of the levels, the particle may decay, emitting another photon with the same phase and frequency as the incident photon. Therefore, by pumping energy into the system we can have a stimulated emission of radiation‚Äîwhich means that the pump forces the system to release a big amount of energy at a specific time. A fundamental characteristic of lasing, like the population inversion, is not actually possible in a two-level system and therefore a two level-laser is not possible. In a two-level atom the pump is, in a way, the laser itself. Coherent terahertz amplification in a Stark ladder superlattice  The amplification of coherent terahertz sound in a Wannier-Stark ladder superlattice has been achieved in 2009 according to a paper publication from the School of Physics and Astronomy in the University of Nottingham. Wannier-Stark effect, exists in superlattices. Electron states in quantum wells respond sensitively to moderate electric fields either by the quantum confined Stark effect in the case of wide barriers or by Wannier-Stark localization in the case of a superlattice. Both effects lead to large changes of the optical properties near the absorption edge, which are useful for intensity modulation and optical switching. Namely, in a mathematical point of view, if an electric field is applied to a superlattice the relevant Hamiltonian exhibits an additional scalar potential. If an eigenstate exists, then the states corresponding to wave functions are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian as well. These states are equally spaced both in energy and real space and form the so-called Wannier-Stark ladder. Stimulated emission of phonons. As the electrons hop between GaAs and AlAs quantum wells in the superlattice they emit phonons. This process is stimulated by other phonons giving rise to the acoustic amplification In the proposed scheme, an application of an electrical bias to a semiconductor superlattice is increasing the amplitude of coherent folded phonons generated by an optical pulse. This increase of the amplitude is observed for those biases in which the energy drop per period of the superlattice is greater than the phonon energy. If the superlattice is biased such that the energy drop per period of the superlattice exceeds the width of electronic minibands (Wannier-Stark regime), the electrons become localized in the quantum wells and vertical electron transport takes place via hopping between neighboring quantum wells, which may be phonon assisted. As it had been shown previously, under these conditions stimulated phonon emission can become the dominant phonon-assisted hoping process for phonons of an energy value close to the Stark splitting. Thus, coherent phonon amplification is theoretically possible in this type of system. Together with the increase in amplitude, the spectrum of the bias- induced oscillations is narrower than the spectrum of the coherent phonons at zero bias. This shows that coherent amplification of phonons due to stimulated emission takes place in the structure under electrical pumping. A bias voltage is applied to a weakly coupled n-doped GaAs/AlAs superlattice and increases the amplitude of the coherent hypersound oscillations generated by a femtosecond optical pulse. An evidence of hypersound amplification by stimulated emission of phonons emerges, in a system where the inversion of the electron populations for phonon-assisted transitions exists. This evidence is provided by the bias-induced amplitude increase and experimentally observer spectral narrowing of the superlattice phonon mode with a frequency of 441 GHz. The main target of this type of experiments is to highlight the realization probability of a coherent amplification of THz sound. The THz stimulated phonon induced transitions between the electron superlattice states lead to this coherent amplification while processing a population inversion. An essential step towards coherent generation (\\"sasing\\") of THz sound and other active hypersound devices has been provided by this achievement of THz sound amplification. Generally, in a device where the threshold for \\"sasing\\" is achieved, the technique described by this proposed scheme could be used to measure the coherence time of the emitted hypersound.

Kireyevsky Ivan Vasilyevich Kireyevsky (; 3 April 1806 in Moscow ‚Äì 23 June 1856 in Saint Petersburg) was a Russian literary critic and philosopher who, together with Aleksey Khomyakov, is credited as a co-founder of the Slavophile movement. Early life and career Ivan Kireyevsky and his brother Pyotr were born into a cultivated noble family of considerable means. Their father was known for hating French atheism so passionately that he would burn heaps of Voltaire's books, acquired specifically for the purpose;Russia and Western Civilization: Cultural and Historical Encounters (ed. by Russell Bova). M.E. Sharpe Publishers, 2003. . Page 38. his fatal disease was contracted while healing the wounded soldiers during the French invasion of Russia. The boy was just six at the time of his death; he was brought up by a maternal uncle, Vasily Zhukovsky, and the mother, M-me Avdotya Yelagina, an influential lady who held a brilliant salon in Moscow. She professed her dislike of Peter the Great for his treatment of his wife Eudoxia and the Lopukhin family, to which she was related. The father's distaste for French culture and the mother's distrust of post-Petrine officialdom may have shaped Kireyevsky's views on Russia and its history. Starting in 1821, Kireyevsky attended the Moscow University, where he became interested in contemporary German philosophy and joined the circle of \\"wisdom-lovers\\" (Lyubomudry), led by Dmitry Venevitinov and Vladimir Odoevsky. He was particularly impressed by the teachings of Schelling, whose representation of the world as a living organism was in tune with Kireyevsky's own intense dislike of European rationalism and fragmentedness. Kireyevsky's original literary works do not give him a place in the history of Russian literature, but he did gain a measure of fame by publishing the penetrating analyses of contemporary authors. His 1828 review of Pushkin's poetry, written in purple prose and entitled \\"Some Observations about the Character of Pushkin's Poetry\\", contained the first in-depth assessment of Eugene Onegin. Later, Kireyevsky would exchange letters with Pushkin and publish his works in his short-lived periodical \\"Yevropeyets\\" (The European). After having been refused by his cousin, Kireyevsky set out for Europe, where he attended the lectures of Schelling, Schleiermacher, Hegel, and Michelet. During his travels, he perceived the rotten foundations of Western society, based on individualism, which he would later contrast with the integrality (sobornost)Kireyevsky's definition of sobornost: \\"The sum total of all Christians of all ages, past and present, comprise one indivisible, eternal living assembly of the faithful, held together just as much by the unity of consciousness as through the communion of prayer\\". Quoted from: Ninian Smart, John Clayton, Patrick Sherry, Steven T. Katz. Nineteenth-Century Religious Thought in the West. Cambridge University Press, 1988. Page 183. of Russian society. Back in Moscow by 1832, he \\"united all the literary aristocracy\\" (as Pogodin said) under the aegis of \\"Yevropeyets\\". The journal was banned after two issues, but not before Kireyevsky published his large article The Nineteenth Century, his first extended critique of Western philosophy and values. The failure of \\"Yevropeyets\\" exacerbated Kireyevsky's disappointment in Russian intellectuals and elite. He married and applied himself wholeheartedly to family life. Many critics, starting with Herzen, tended to attribute the twelve-year hiatus in Kireyevsky's literary career to his Oblomovian inclination to indecision and inaction.Alexei S. Khomiakov, Ivan Kireevskii, Boris Jakim, Robert Bird. On Spiritual Unity. SteinerBooks, 1998. . Page 18.

Since the reactionary reign of Nicholas I was not favourable for journalistic activities, Khomyakov and Kireyevsky criticized the \\"one- sided, superficial, analytical rationality\\" of the West in salons and soir√©es of Moscow.Philosophical Imagination and Cultural Memory. Duke University Press, 1993. . Page 179. In his few written works, Kireyevsky contrasted the philosophy of Plato and Greek Church Fathers (notably Maximus the Confessor) with the rationalism of Aristotle and medieval Catholic Doctors of the Church. He blamed Aristotle \\"for molding the mind of the West in the iron cast of reasonableness\\", which he defined as timid prudence (as opposed to true wisdom) or the \\"striving for the better within the circle of the commonplace\\".Ian Buruma, Avishai Margalit. Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of Its Enemies. Penguin, 2004. Page 91. Hegel's doctrines were seen as the latest emanation of Aristotle's analytical approach, which divorced mind from soul, thoughts from (religious) feelings. Kireyevsky aspired to retrieve the lost wholeness of Man in the teachings of Eastern Orthodoxy. His devout wife introduced him to the elders (startsy) of the Optina Monastery, which he frequented in the declining years of his life. Although he did not share Yuri Samarin's radical enthusiasm for all things pre-Petrine, Kireyevsky extolled the spiritual treasures of medieval Russia. According to him, the monasteries of ancient Rus' \\"radiated a uniform and harmonious light of faith and learning\\" to disparate Slavonic tribes and principalities. The net of churches and monasteries covered Russia so thickly, that these 'bonds of spiritual community' unified the country into \\"a single living organism\\".Susanna Rabow- Edling. Slavophile Thought And the Politics of Cultural Nationalism. SUNY Press, 2006. . Page 90. He died at the age of 50 during a cholera epidemic. His brother Pyotr outlived him by several months. They were buried side by side in the Optina Monastery, the first laymen to be honoured so.

Like most areas of New England, Fairfield County is (and has been at all times since well before the 20th century) entirely divided into incorporated municipalities. There is no unincorporated territory. There are three types of municipalities in Connecticut: towns, boroughs and cities. As in the other New England states, towns are the basic unit of municipal government. Boroughs overlay towns and assume responsibility for some municipal services within their boundaries. Boroughs are not found in any of the other New England states, and are not very common in Connecticut today, although they were somewhat more numerous in the past. A number of boroughs have disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. Cities also overlay towns. This is different from the other New England states, where cities are a different type of municipality equivalent to a town (this difference is related to cities having originally developed in Connecticut from the borough model). Most current cities are coextensive with their parent town, however, such that the entire municipality functions as a city. In practice, these cities are really no different from cities in the other New England states. It is also possible for a city in Connecticut to overlay part, but not all, of a town. There are currently only one or two examples, but it was a more common arrangement in the past. Many of today‚Äôs coextensive cities were non-coextensive at one time. As with boroughs, a number of non-coextensive cities have also disincorporated over the years, choosing to revert to full town control. The main tables below show municipalities at the town level. For any census, adding up the totals for each town should yield the county total. In cases where a community encompassed a coextensive city, the tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series mark the community as a city. In cases where a town included a non-coextensive city, the total shown below represents the entire town, including but not limited to the city. A separate section follows with population totals for boroughs and non-coextensive cities. For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town.

The weighbridge is the two part platform over which trucks are driven. The upper works is auxiliary equipment for leveling the load in the truck and is not part of the scale. This scale uses electronic measuring equipment A truck scale (US), weighbridge (non-US) or railroad scale is a large set of scales, usually mounted permanently on a concrete foundation, that is used to weigh entire rail or road vehicles and their contents. By weighing the vehicle both empty and when loaded, the load carried by the vehicle can be calculated. The key component that uses a weighbridge in order to make the weigh measurement is load cells.  Weight certification in the United States  Commercial scales have to be National Type Evaluation Program (NTEP) approved or certified. The certification is issued by the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM), in accordance to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), \\"Handbook 44\\" specifications and tolerances,Handbook 44- Retrieved 2020-04-05 through Conformity Assessment and the Verified Conformity Assessment Program (VCAP)Conformity-assessment- Retrieved 2011-09-17  Legal for trade  Handbook 44: General Code paragraph G-A.1.; and the NIST Handbook 130 (Uniform Weights and Measures Law; Section 1.13.) define Commercial Weighing and Measuring Equipment as follows; NTEP approved scales are generally considered those scales which are intended by the manufacturer for use in commercial applications where products are sold by weight. NTEP Approved is also known as Legal for Trade or complies with Handbook 44. NTEP scales are commonly used for applications ranging from weighing coldcuts at the deli, to fruit at the roadside farm stand, shipping centers for determining shipping cost to weighing gold and silver and more.  Types  Truck scale in Altare (Italy) * Electronic (deep pit type) * Electronic (pit less type) * Digital (deep pit type) * Digital (shallow pit) * Digital (pit less type) * Rail Weighbridges * Movable Weighbridge * Mechanical weighbridge * Mechanical (digital type) * Electro-mechanical * Portable weighbridge * Axle scales * Portable ramp end scales  Design Concept Electronic indicator for the bridge shown above. This allows input of the vehicle empty weight and can compute and display the amount of material A full-size weighbridge Truck scales can be surface mounted with a ramp leading up a short distance and the weighing equipment underneath or they can be pit mounted with the weighing equipment and platform in a pit so that the weighing surface is level with the road. They are typically built from steel or concrete and by nature are extremely robust. In earlier versions the bridge is installed over a rectangular pit that contains levers that ultimately connect to a balance mechanism. The most complex portion of this type is the arrangement of levers underneath the weighbridge since the response of the scale must be independent of the distribution of the load. Modern devices use multiple load cells that connect to an electronic equipment to totalize the sensor inputs. In either type of semi-permanent scale the weight readings are typically recorded in a nearby hut or office. Many weighbridges are now linked to a PC which runs truck scale software capable of printing tickets and providing reporting features.  Uses  Truck scales can be used for two main purposes: * Selling or charging by weight over the bridge (Trade Approved) * Check weighing both axle weights and gross vehicle weights. This helps to stop axle overloading and possible heavy fines. They are used in industries that manufacture or move bulk items, such as in mines or quarries, garbage dumps / recycling centers, bulk liquid and powder movement, household goods, and electrical equipment. Since the weight of the vehicle carrying the goods is known (and can be ascertained quickly if it is not known by the simple expedient of weighing the empty vehicle) they are a quick and easy way to measure the flow of bulk goods in and out of different locations. A single axle truck scale or axle weighing system can be used to check individual axle weights and gross vehicle weights to determine whether the vehicle is safe to travel on the public highway without being stopped and fined by the authorities for being overloaded. Similar to the full size truck scale these systems can be pit mounted with the weighing surface flush to the level of the roadway or surface mounted. For many uses (such as at police over the road truck weigh stations or temporary road intercepts) weighbridges have been largely supplanted by simple and thin electronic weigh cells, over which a vehicle is slowly driven. A computer records the output of the cell and accumulates the total vehicle weight. By weighing the force of each axle it can be assured that the vehicle is within statutory limits, which typically will impose a total vehicle weight, a maximum weight within an axle span limit and an individual axle limit. The former two limits ensure the safety of bridges while the latter protects the road surface.  Portable versions  Portable truck scales can also be found in use around the world. A portable truck scale will have lower frame work that can be placed on non-typical surfaces such as dirt. These scales retain the same level of accuracy as a pit-type scale, with accuracy of up to + or - 1%. The first portable truck scale record in the US was units operated by the Weight Patrol of the Los Angeles Motor Patrol in 1929. Four such weighing units were used with one under each of the trucks wheels. Each unit could record up to .\\"Portable Scales Detect Overweight Trucks.\\" Popular Science Monthly, November 1929, p. 62, bottom of page.

It is sometimes abbreviated SS, but is not to be confused with settleable solids, also abbreviated SS, which contribute to the blocking of sewer pipes. Explanation Suspended solids are important as pollutants and pathogens are carried on the surface of particles. The smaller the particle size, the greater the total surface area per unit mass of particle in grams, and so the higher the pollutant load that is likely to be carried. Removal Removal of suspended solids is generally achieved through the use of sedimentation and/or water filters (usually at a municipal level). By eliminating most of the suspended solids in a water supply, the significant water is usually rendered close to drinking quality. This is followed by disinfection to ensure that any free floating pathogens, or pathogens associated with the small remaining amount of suspended solids, are rendered ineffective. Effectiveness of filtering The use of a very simple cloth filter, consisting of a folded cotton sari, drastically reduces the load of cholera carried in the water, and is suitable for use by the very poor; in this case, an appropriate technology method of disinfection might be added, such as solar water disinfection. A major exception to this generalization is arsenic contamination of groundwater, as arsenic is a very serious pollutant which is soluble, and thus not removed when suspended solids are removed. This makes it very difficult to remove, and finding an alternative water source is often the most realistic option.

Ned returns east, where John Wilkes Booth is starring in The Taming of the Shrew to great acclaim at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Billed as the son and successor to Junius Brutus Booth, John is planning a tour and asks Ned if he will be his manager along with their younger sister, Asia. Somewhat contemptuous of his upstart brother's early success as an actor, Ned declines. He tells his younger brother that he hasn't learned the craft the way he, Ned, has by traveling with, hearing the performances, and looking after their father for many years. Ned begins a theater tour of his own with Dave Prescott. He travels to New Orleans, where he meets, then soon marries, Mary Devlin, a member of a theatrical company who plays Juliet opposite Ned's role as Romeo. The Civil War breaks out and John is said to be working steadfastly for the Confederacy's cause. He declines an offer from Ned to go to London together for a production of Hamlet, and when a pregnant Mary falls ill, Ned begins drinking heavily and missing performances. Mary's death turns her husband morose. Then comes the terrible news one night that John Wilkes Booth has assassinated President Abraham Lincoln by gunshot at Ford's theater. Weeks after the assassination, and his brother's subsequent death on a farm in Virginia, Ned has decided to return to the stage in Hamlet. On opening night the theater is packed by a mob incensed by the murder of the president and blaming not only Booth but all actors and theaters in general. One protester says the president \\"died in the very doorway to hell\\" because he was murdered in a theater. Backstage, Dave Prescott tells Ned that the show must be canceled. Ned insists that he wants to go on for his profession as well as his family name, remembering that his late wife once said that acting was his gift, his purpose in life and he must \\"never be derelict\\" to that purpose. Ned is seated center stage on the throne as the curtain comes up. The mob hurls insults, vegetables, and other objects at Ned as the other actors rush off the stage. Ned remains seated, immobile, and absorbs the abuse until the crowd's fury exhausts itself. Finally one of the protesters declares \\"he's got guts\\", shouts \\"Booth, you're alright!\\", and begins clapping. Gradually more of the mob join him, the other actors return to the stage, and the film ends with Ned hearing his late wife speaking part of Juliet's soliloquy as the crowd's approval continues to rise.

She started researching it in 1948. The New York Times called it \\"an able biography.\\" Another review in the same paper called it \\"enthralling\\". The book became a best seller. Development 20th Century Fox bought the film rights in January 1953, before the book had been published. Richard Burton, who had a contract with the studio, was linked with the project from the beginning, although there were reports he might play John Wilkes Booth. Darryl F. Zanuck, head of Fox, reportedly wanted Laurence Olivier or Marlon Brando for Edwin Booth. Sol Siegel was the original producer. In May 1953 Moss Hart signed to write the script. In April 1953, Fox announced the film would be shot in CinemaScope. Eventually Siegel dropped out as producer and was replaced by Philip Dunne. \\"Moss has done a really brilliant dramatisation of the book\\", said Dunne. In November 1953, Richard Burton signed a new seven- film contract with Fox, the first of which was to be the lead in Prince of Players. In June 1954, Jay Robinson was cast as John Wilkes Booth. In July 1954, Eva Le Galliene was hired as technical consultant on the recommendation of Moss Hart She later agreed to appear in the film as an actor, performing in scenes with Burton. It was her first film.Dunne later said \\"I couldn't find a director whom I thought could do justice to the script so Zanuck said 'direct it yourself'.\\" In July Dunne was appointed director as well as producer. Jay Robinson lost his part to John Derek. Shooting Filming started August 1954. \\"On the first day, I was terrified\\", said Dunne. \\"There looking at me were Richard Burton, Raymond Massey, Eva Le Gallienne and up walks Charlie Bickford, old, cantankerous, and known to punch out directors before breakfast.'Anyone here you want me to kick real hard?' old Charlie asked.\\" Dunne said directing was \\"fun when you have a good story and players who know what they're supposed to do.\\" Dunne later said Hart's script was about half an hour too long and that Dunne trimmed it by cutting within scenes.Lee Server, Screenwriter: Words Become Pictures, 1987 p 109 Reception The film was a financial failure, the first movie in CinemaScope to lose money. Dunne said he thought \\"it was too larded with Shakespeare\\".

Access to some services involves licence or subscription by universities, colleges or schools and requires some form of authentication by end users. Some services are also provided to researchers outside the UK academic sector. A key service, offered since January 2000, is Digimap, with its core Ordnance Survey collection.Digimap Another long-standing service is SUNCAT, a Serials Union Catalogue for the UK.SUNCAT In addition to front-end services, EDINA provide middleware services, which provide connections between various other data applications across the UK Higher Education computing sector and beyond. History EDINA has its origin in Edinburgh University Data Library, which was set up in 1983/4. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh working with data from government surveys were looking to the University to provide university-wide provision for files that were too large to be stored on individual computing accounts. Arrangements for the University Library to purchase the small area statistics from the 1981 Population Census became the opportunity to petition action by the Program Library Unit (PLU) - which had both local responsibility for software provision and a national role to convert software for various computing platforms for UK universities. The PLU was also active in the design and implementation of the code for SASPAC, the program used widely for the extraction of census data, as part of a project led by David Rhind of Durham University. In response, the Data Library was formed as a small group within the PLU led by Trevor Jones plus 1.5 staff: use of a programmer and a computing assistant. Peter Burnhill took over full- time responsibility in 1984. Early holdings were the 1981 UK population census, and research data from the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Strathclyde. Geographic information was a focus from the beginning, as the Data Library worked with researcher Jack Hotson to convert parish-based agricultural census data to grid square estimates. This allowed detailed visualisation of land use across the UK. A collaboration with the Department of Geography saw the establishment of the Regional Research Laboratory for Scotland, focusing on quantitative techniques in the Social Sciences. Soon afterwards followed SALSER, a serials index bringing together libraries from the thirteen Scottish universities, the National Library of Scotland and the two major civic libraries of Edinburgh and Glasgow. SALSER remains heavily used to this day, providing public access to important specialist serials collections. Links to the research community were cemented by the RAPID project, which linked research activity to the output of other work funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. Uniquely, RAPID included not only conventional monograph and journal publications, but also new types of research output such as software, datasets and learning materials. Reusable components for self-paced learning were to become an integral part of the department's role a few years later. Such projects built up a wealth of knowledge within the Data Library, and a breadth of subject which was to serve it well for the most important event in its history - the launch of the EDINA national data centre in 1995/96. Along with BIDS (acquired by ingenta in 1998) at the University of Bath and MIDAS (now Mimas) at the University of Manchester, the Edinburgh University Data Library was chosen as a JISC-funded centre for the provision of data services to the entire UK academic community. EDINA's new services included bibliographic indexes such as BIOSIS and Ei Compendex, which helped with literature searches, and UKBORDERS, which filled a gap in census, political and postal boundary data. The Digimap service, launched in 2000, continues to provide access to a number of national geospatial data sets including Ordnance Survey GB maps and data, historical Ordnance Survey GB maps and maps and data of UK geology and hydrographic and other marine environments. SUNCAT, the Serials Union Catalogue for the UK research community became a freely available EDINA service in 2006, and contains data from scores of UK research libraries, including the British Library and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. With the launch of EDINA, the Data Library had to be redefined to continue its local remit, distinct from the national services. Donald Morse took on the role of manager of the new Local Services team, and Joan Fairgrieve became the University's first Data Librarian.

History The post-1945 boom in business theory led, in the 1950s and 1960s, to a focus on forecasting as a major component of planning. The principle then adopted was that existing trends could be extrapolated into the medium- and long-term future. The techniques were mainly numerical, and largely based on time-series analysis; though regression analysis, for investigating historical trends, eventually also emerged as a much reported technique. The seemingly mathematical accuracy of the techniques was seductive and, in the relatively stable decade of the 1960s, it often appeared that they worked well, even in the longer term. The 1970s brought an end to this stability, most notably in the repercussions of the ending of the Bretton Woods agreement on currency stability closely followed by the oil shock of 1973. The emphasis moved to the development of alternative forecasts. The attempt then was to see what the possible range of alternative futures might be, so that contingency plans could be laid to handle whatever occurred in practice. It was the decade of the futurologists, led by the group at SRI (Stanford Research Institute) and, in particular, publicized by Herman Kahn (of the Hudson Institute). The optimism of these futurologists, even if just in their focus on the future, was overtaken by the pessimism of the 1980s. Even during the 1970s the Club of Rome's report (forecasting the problems posed by population growth at the same time as the depletion of natural resources) was already offering a very pessimistic, indeed alarmist alternative. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), reporting at the end of the 1980s, described the international scene in terms of: * increased international interdependence * growing complexity in international relationships * growing economic competition between nations * heightened uncertainty. The result was that many organizations reverted to planning only for the relatively short term, if at all. The optimism of the futurologists was judged to be out of step with the gloomier mood of the times. Planning horizons, even for some of the more sophisticated organizations, shrank from ten years to five to three. Most concentrated once more on the one-year (budgetary) planning cycle they knew and understood. Indeed, there are practical limits to the resources which can be devoted to long-range planning. It can be a time-consuming process absorbing large resources of money and people, which many organizations do not have (or are unwilling to make available). In too many organizations, however, it is also constrained by ignorance or indifference. With very few exceptions, both long-term and short-term planning are needed for successful corporate management. Proactive management As the experiences of the 1970s and 1980s showed, unpredictable changes can be very disorienting. These major changes, usually discontinuities referred to as fractures in the environment rather than trends, will largely determine the long-term future of the organization. They need to be handled, as opportunities, as positively as possible. While horizons of many corporations have grown shorter, some industries still require long term decision-making by the nature of their work. Examples include energy companies which need to take a view about energy prices over two decades ahead in calculating the potential returns from investing in a new oil field, and the pharmaceutical industry where it can take up to fifteen years to bring a drug to market, requiring a view about what health service demand will be for such a treatment some twenty years hence, and whether governments will be likely to pay for it. Types of uncertainty In looking to the future managers have to deal with uncertainty. Indeed, the processes involved largely aim to identify these uncertainties and manage their impact on the organization. In this context, there are (using the terminology of Kees van der Heijden) three main types of uncertainty: #Risks ‚Äì where historical evidence of similar events allows us to estimate the probabilities of future outcomes. #Structural uncertainties ‚Äì where the event is unique enough not to offer evidence of such probabilities. #Unknowables ‚Äì where we cannot even imagine the event. Managers are well used to handling 'ordinary' risks and regularly come into contact with such risks and, indeed, this is one aspect of entrepreneurial activity managers are supposed to even relish. Where no probable pattern of outcomes can be derived from previous experience the decisions involved become much more a matter of judgement; and this is the area where scenario planning can make a major contribution. Unknowables are, by definition, unknown, so nothing can be done about them in advance; except develop the ability to react rapidly to them. Forecasting, budgeting and organizational dynamics In the shorter term, there is often confusion between budgeting and forecasting. They are sometimes used interchangeably, but should be distinguished as shown below: #Forecasting is the activity of predicting what will happen in the future (usually expressed, in the short and medium term, in terms of statistics ‚Äì and especially the organization's own key figures). The important element is that it is based upon certain general assumptions (typically that all other things are equal, without any special action being taken on the part of the organization making the forecast). These assumptions may or (usually) may not be explicit. #Budgeting expresses what the organization believes is specifically achievable and intends will be achieved, by its planned actions. The budget is a target which the organization sets for itself, so that the budget becomes management's commitment to action. In theory, if not in practice, the unbiased forecast (albeit usually based upon hidden assumptions) should be an input into the subsequent budget, which is then a measure of where the organization intends to go ‚Äì and indeed is targeted to go! Many so-called forecasts prepared by organizations should, therefore, more correctly be called budgets. This represents not just a dispute about terminology, but a major problem of confused attitudes. The forecast is the basis for planning, and has to be as accurate and unbiased as possible. The budget is directly linked to implementation and to accountability by management: it has to be practical and achievable. The requirements of the two are, therefore, very different; to confuse them weakens both processes. As soon as the organization introduces a bias resulting from this budgeting element the subsequent forecasts become less independent ‚Äì the relationships between the elements more complex, the assumptions more clouded, and the figures less easily understood by the participants. A further problem with the organizational dynamics of forecasting is the adaptation of forecasts to changed circumstances in the external environment. It is often assumed that forecasts are immutable: the annual forecast is to be renewed in 12 months' time, and not a moment earlier; the five-year plan will only be replaced in five years' time. It is felt an admission of failure if such forecasts have to be changed. This is understandable where these so-called forecasts are actually targets to which the organization is committed. But clearly true forecasts (as opposed to budgets or targets) should be amended as and when the environment changes. The best managed organizations probably have a quarterly review of their annual forecast (and associated budgets), so that forecasts for the remaining quarters can be based on the latest information. The most sophisticated indulge in rolling forecasts whereby at each quarter a full year ahead is forecast ‚Äì in other words a new fourth quarter is added to the plan. This takes much of the drama out of the annual planning cycle, and means that there is not a period in the year when the forecast may only cover a matter of days. This can happen, and often does, if the new annual forecast is only agreed in December, to cover January onwards! Even five-year forecasts may need to change quite dramatically each time they are reviewed, in this case typically on an annual basis. Over the preceding year it is more than likely that the external environment, as well as the organization's own internal environment, will have changed significantly ‚Äì and in ways that were not predicted. The overall economy will have changed direction, competitors will have changed strategies, consumers will have changed their tastes. The new five-year plan has to take all this into account. The position may be different in the case of long-range planning, since it may look decades ahead. The effort involved in such a process may mean that such forecasts are repeated less frequently; typically every three to four years, rather than three to four times a year. This is acceptable when the time horizon is two decades or more ‚Äì since any interim changes are unlikely to have direct impact on the shorter-term budgets ‚Äì though any major changes detected should, even so, prompt an immediate review.

Development  The PWS-19 was constructed in 1930 in order to replace the French-designed bombers Potez 25 and Breguet 19 in the Polish Air Force. It was a development of the PWS-17, which remained unbuilt. Main designers were Zbys≈Çaw Cio≈Çkosz and Antoni Uszacki. It was planned to be produced in two variants: reconnaissance PWS-19A2 and bomber PWS-19B2. It was a conventional design, a strutted high-wing monoplane with quite elegant silhouette, open cockpits and fixed landing gear. It was fitted with double tailfins to obtain a good field of defense fire. In 1934 Antoni Uszacki designed a smaller plane basing on the PWS-19, designated PWS U-6, with G-1620 Mors 400 hp engine. It participated in a contest for an army cooperation plane, but lost against RWD-14 Czapla and was not built.  Operational history  The only prototype first flew in Bia≈Ça Podlaska in September 1931. During tests it showed quite good flight characteristics, although the rudders had to be enlarged to improve manoeuvrability and stability. However, on March 17, in 1933, the wings distorted in a dive and the prototype crashed (killing an observer). The Air Force considered ordering the PWS-19A2 powered by a Bristol Pegasus engine, but at the same time, a more modern aircraft the PZL.23 Kara≈õ had been developed by PZL - a low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction. As a result, works upon the PWS-19 stopped.  Description  Mixed construction high-wing (parasol) monoplane. A fuselage of a steel frame, covered with duralumin in front section and canvas in mid and rear sections. Two-spar wings, of wooden construction, plywood covered. Stabilizers, rudder and elevator of metal construction, canvas covered. Twin vertical tailfins. Crew of two (pilot and observer/gunner) in open individual cockpits. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid. The plane was fitted with RKL/D radio and camera. Engine: 9 cylinder air-cooled radial Pratt & Whitney Hornet T2 in front, with a Townend ring (there were optional Bristol Jupiter VII or Bristol Pegasus). Two-blade metal propeller of a fixed pitch. Fuel tank 420 l in a fuselage, dropped in emergency.

He was portrayed by Erik Palladino.  Season 6  Dave Malucci first appears as a second-year resident. He often breaks protocol to get things done and appears to lack warmth towards patients, but is occasionally shown to be both sensitive and insightful, particularly where younger patients are involved (a story in the episode \\"Loose Ends\\" very strongly implies that Malucci was physically and/or sexually abused when he was a child). In \\"Last Rites,\\" Malucci and John Carter steal medical gear from an ambulance to help some construction workers injured at a site; later, Kerry Weaver reprimands them for violating emergency protocols and Carter comes away with a negative view of Malucci that he never really changes his mind about. Malucci attended medical school in Grenada, and in \\"Great Expectations,\\" he uses his knowledge of the Caribbean to accurately diagnose a patient with a rare disease called Jamaican Vomiting Sickness because he recognized the symptoms from eating the area's akee fruit. In \\"Such Sweet Sorrow,\\" Malucci allows Abby Lockhart to discharge a female patient without examining her personally. The patient later suffers an internal injury and nearly dies. After performing surgery to save the patient, Elizabeth Corday bluntly tells Malucci the staff considers him a sloppy, lazy physician and that \\"[none of us] think you're much of a doctor.\\" Although his incompetence and abrasiveness were the source of several dramatic events, he was most often used for comic relief due to his offbeat personality and tendency to get pranked, injured, or end up doing odd things like eating cereal out of an Emesis basin (with milk that, he didn't realize, was breast- pumped by Nurse Carol Hathaway). He and Jing-Mei \\"Deb\\" Chen had a somewhat- adversarial relationship that also hinted at possible signs of attraction between the two; Dave appeared visibly flustered when Deb walked into County's front desk to pick up files wearing a \\"nice\\" dress while he was trying to flirt with Abby. This got shunted aside once Dave found other staff members to annoy after his repeated flirtations were efficiently shut down (though he was never particularly upset) and Deb entered into a relationship with ICU Nurse Frank Bacon.  Season 7  Malucci continues to clash with other staff members in Season 7. When Mark Greene discounts his view that a teenage patient is being mistreated by his father, Malucci (whose empathy toward victims of child abuse is a recurring theme, along with suggestions he was himself a victim) makes a snide remark about Greene's brain tumor, leading to friction between the two. In \\"The Visit,\\" Peter Benton's nephew Jesse dies in the ER from gunshot wounds, and Malucci's callous, gang-related remarks provoke Benton into physically attacking him. His attraction to Dr. Chen disappears without any explanation and no signs of it ever resurface; their relationship is shown to be adversarial in a late season episode when an angry patient refuses to let Malucci examine her; when asked to take over, Chen lashes out at Malucci and refuses to help. The patient, a homeless former TV show host later recognized by Kerry Weaver, then sprays Malucci with Mace.  Season 8  In \\"The Longer You Stay\\", Chen and Malucci attempt to treat a patient without compiling a complete medical history and fail to recognize his illness as Marfan syndrome, which Carter correctly diagnoses immediately after seeing the patient's chest X-ray, but too late to do anything. Malucci mistakenly assumes the patient is a drug user, and the procedure he and Chen perform proves to be fatal. Kerry Weaver, the on-duty attending physician during this incident, could not be reached because she had gone across the street to Doc Magoo‚Äôs and left her pager in the restroom. When she returns and learns of Chen and Malucci's procedure, which required her authorization to be performed, she became enraged and tells Malucci that \\"in a perfect world, Dr. Malucci, I would never subject any patients to your care.\\" Chen is ultimately forced to resign over the incident, though she later appeals the decision and returns. In \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic\\", Malucci is caught having sex with a paramedic in an ambulance, giving a still-angry Weaver an excuse to recommend his dismissal. Mark Greene attempts to convince Weaver that she cannot fire Malucci simply because she doesn't tolerate him, since by that criterion \\"You'd have to fire all of us!\\". Weaver cites several letters of reprimand and two failed rotations on file, promising that even if the hospital chooses not to terminate Malucci, she will ensure he never works in the ER again. In a last-ditch effort to save his job, Malucci reveals to Weaver that he \\"has a kid to support.\\" Weaver wavers for a minute, but then repeats that he is fired. In retaliation, he bitterly tells Weaver that the only reason she wants to be in charge of the ER is because she has nothing and no one else in her life. He leaves after calling her a \\"Nazi dyke\\". Malucci appears for the final time in \\"Never Say Never\\" when Weaver enters the doctor's lounge as he is cleaning out his locker. While removing his name tag, he and Weaver have a moment of mutual enmity. He then leaves the lounge and County, never to be seen again. Malucci was the first of four characters to leave in season 8. He is mentioned in the episode \\"Brothers and Sisters\\", when Dr. Carter tells young resident Michael Gallant that Malucci was reckless and \\"killed a patient\\". This would be the last time Malucci would be acknowledged by any of the characters on the show.  Season 15  During the 15th and final season of ER, at the end of the episode \\"The Book of Abby\\", long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, the tag \\"Malucci\\" can be seen.

Early life Born on 16 February 1927, St Clair was the son of Major-General G.P. St Clair CB CBE DSO. He was educated at Eton College.M. Stenton and S. Lees (eds), Who's Who of British Members of Parliament: Volume IV 1945‚Äì1979, Harvester Press, 1981, p. 325 After leaving school, St Clair joined the Royal Armoured Corps as a trooper and in 1946 was commissioned as an officer into the Royal Scots Greys. He left the Army in 1948. Political career St Clair served as honorary secretary to Winston Churchill from 1948 to 1950, before returning to run his family's dairy farm at Tetbury in Gloucestershire.Malcolm St Clair's election literature, 1961 In 1955, he stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate at the London County Council elections, in Islington East. At the 1959 general election he stood as Conservative candidate in Bristol South East, but he lost to the sitting Labour Member of Parliament Tony Benn (then known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn), whose majority was nearly 6,000 votes. However, in November 1960 Benn's father died and Benn inherited his peerage as Viscount Stansgate, with an automatic seat in the House of Lords. This disqualified Benn from sitting in the House of Commons, triggering a by-election on 4 May 1961. Benn, who wished to be allowed to disclaim his peerage, defied his inability to sit in the Commons by standing at the election, and he and St Clair were the only two candidates. St Clair's campaign displayed posters near every polling station warning voters that Benn was disqualified and that any votes for him would have no effect. Benn nevertheless won the election with nearly 70% of the votes and an increased majority of over 13,000.1961 By Elections However, an Election Court considered what to do about the result, found that Benn was disqualified from being elected and that the voters were aware of this, and awarded the seat to St. Clair as the only duly qualified candidate. (At the time, St Clair was himself Master of Sinclair ‚Äì heir presumptive (1957‚Äì1968) to his second cousin Charles St Clair, 17th Lord Sinclair, one of the representative peers for Scotland in the House of Lords.)Mosley, Charles (ed.) Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition. (Wilmington, Delaware: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), vol. 1, p. 1056 & vol. 3, pp. 3627‚Äì3629. Outside Parliament, Benn continued to campaign for a change in the law to allow him to disclaim his peerage and return to the Commons, and eventually the Conservative government agreed. The Peerage Act 1963, making such a change in the law, was given the Royal Assent and became law shortly after 6 p.m. on 31 July 1963. Benn was the first peer to disclaim his title, at 6.22 p.m. that day. St Clair had already given an undertaking that he would respect the wishes of the people of Bristol if Benn became eligible to take his seat again, so he immediately resigned by accepting the office of Steward of the Manor of Northstead. This triggered another by-election at which St Clair did not stand, and indeed there was no Conservative or Liberal candidate. On 20 August 1963, Benn was returned to the Commons with nearly 80% of the votes.1963 By Elections Later life St Clair served in the Territorial Army as a Major in the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, and as Lieutenant-Colonel from 1967 to 1969. He was High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1972. He died on 1 February 2004, aged 76. Personal life In June 1955, St Clair married Rosalie Alice, daughter of Wing-Commander C.L. Hargreaves and granddaughter of Alice Liddell. He lived at Upton House, Tetbury, Gloucestershire, and 28 Chesham Place, London. He was a member of the Cavalry Club.

He is known as the last person to be executed in New Zealand before the abolition of capital punishment. Bolton was born in Wanganui and grew up in nearby Mangamahu. He married Beatrice Mabel Jones in 1913, but Beatrice died on 11 July 1956 after a long and debilitating illness. An autopsy found traces of arsenic in her body, and a police investigation was launched. Bolton was formally charged with her murder in September. The prosecution claimed that Bolton was having an affair with Beatrice's sister, Florence, who had moved in to help look after Beatrice, and that Bolton had poisoned his wife with arsenic he possessed for use on his farm. It also alleged that he and Florence had destroyed Beatrice's diary. Bolton's defence argued that Beatrice could have been poisoned accidentally, by arsenic entering the water supply. Water on the Bolton's farm was tested and found to contain arsenic, and traces of arsenic were also found in Bolton and one of his daughters Official NZ History website Despite this evidence, a jury quickly found Bolton guilty of murdering his wife, and he was sentenced to death. He was hanged at Mount Eden Prison in Auckland on 18 February 1957, aged 68. According to a contemporary newspaper account, his execution was allegedly botched -- instead of breaking his neck instantly, he was slowly strangled to death. Shortly afterward, the New Zealand Labour Party won the 1957 New Zealand General Election and in effect, the practice of capital punishment ended with Bolton's execution. The death penalty faced statutory abolition for homicide and most other crimes when Parliament passed the Crimes Act 1961. (The last vestiges of the death penalty in New Zealand -- for treason and similar acts -- were abolished with the passage of the Abolition of the Death Penalty Act 1989). In the parliamentary debate on the death penalty in 1961 the Bolton case was referred to (without naming him) by two Labour MPs Walter Nash and Fred Hackett as an executed murder whose guilt was doubted by counsel, his doctor and the clergyman who officiated at the execution. In recent times, there has been speculation as to whether Bolton was guilty. His son, James Bolton, has attempted to clear his father's name. Sherwood Young dealt with the issue in his history of capital punishment in New Zealand in 1998.Sherwood Young (1998) Guilty on the Gallows: Famous Capital Crimes of New Zealand: Wellington: Grantham House: In January 2001, Investigate Magazine published an article suggesting that Florence (who committed suicide some time after the events) was responsible for her sister's death and that she had also killed others. It is claimed that a note existed in which she admitted this, but that the note was suppressed.

It attained full university status on 25 October 2007 and was launched as such by John Agyekum Kufuor, former President of the Republic of Ghana. It was first called Regional Maritime Academy. History On 1 October 1982, the Government of Ghana promulgated the Regional Maritime Law 1982, which was followed by the signing of the instrument of transfer, handing over the college to the then Ministerial Conference of West and Central African States on Maritime Transport (MINCONMAR), now known as Maritime Organization of West and Central Africa (MOWCA), which negotiated for its regionalization. The college was then renamed the Regional Maritime Academy (RMA). The formal inauguration of the RMA took place 26 May 1983, with Ghana as a founding member. Regionalization of the academy was for cooperation, particularly with regard to the training of personnel to ensure the sustained growth and development of maritime industries in the sub-region and beyond. The academy in Ghana serves the Anglophone countries while a sister academy in Ivory Coast (L'Acad√©mie R√©gionale des Sciences et Techniques de la Mer ‚Äì ARSTM) serves the Francophone countries. Organization The Regional Maritime University is an international tertiary institution and private university. The RMU occupies the premises of the old Ghana Nautical College which was established in 1958 to train ratings for the erstwhile State Shipping Corporation (Black Star Line). On 1 October 1982, the Government of Ghana promulgated the Regional Maritime Law 1982 which was followed by the signing of the instrument of transfer, handing over the college to the then Ministerial Conference of West and Central African States on Maritime Transport (MINCONMAR), now known as Maritime Organization of West and Central Africa (MOWCA), which negotiated for its regionalization. The college was then renamed the Regional Maritime Academy (RMA). The overall objective for the establishment of RMU was to promote regional co-operation in the maritime industry, focusing on the training to ensure the sustained growth and development of the industry.

Having been founded over 100 years ago, for the first time, in the 2015‚Äì16 season, Leicester City won the Premier League, with Claudio Ranieri being the manager. Also, in the same season, the team qualified for the UEFA Champions League. Leicester Fosse (1884‚Äì1919) The club was founded in 1884 as Leicester Fosse because it played on a field by the Fosse Road. Before moving to Filbert Street in 1891, the club played at five different grounds. The club joined the Football Association in 1890. It joined in the Midland League in 1891, and after finishing second was elected to the Division Two of the Football League in 1894. The first ever league game was a 4‚Äì3 defeat at Grimsby, but a week later at Filbert Street the club recorded its first league win against Rotherham. The club's largest win to date, 13‚Äì0 against Notts Olympic in a FA Cup qualifying game was also recorded in that season. In 1904, the club successfully re-applied for membership of the Football League. In 1908, the club finished as Second Division runners-up and reached the First Division, but was relegated again after just one season. In 1909, the club recorded its worst ever defeat, a 12‚Äì0 drubbing against Nottingham Forest. Leicester City is born (1919‚Äì1939) The club was re- elected to the Football League for the last time to date in 1915, when the League was suspended for four years due to a financial scandal and World War I. Leicester were playing in a regional league organised for Midlands clubs in this period. Due to financial problems, Leicester Fosse had ceased to exist when the League resumed in 1919. The club was reformed as Leicester City Football Club, particularly appropriate as the borough of Leicester had recently been given city status. In 1925, the club were champions of Division Two under the management of Peter Hodge. Hodge's signings included Arthur Chandler, one of City's most famous players from this period, scoring a club record 273 goals between 1923 and 1935 and Adam Black, who has the club record for league appearances, 528. In 1929, the club recorded its highest ever finish in the Football League, finishing second to Sheffield Wednesday. The club's highest ever attendance was in 1928, 47,298 against Tottenham Hotspur into the FA Cup Fifth Round. The 1930s were less successful, with the club being relegated in 1935, although finishing first in Division Two in 1937, only to be relegated from Division One again in 1939. In 1939, the Football League was suspended due to the war, and just like in 1915‚Äì1919, City were forced along with other clubs to play in regional leagues. Yo-Yo years (1949‚Äì1958) City reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their history in 1949, losing 3‚Äì1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers. The club, however, was celebrating a week later when a draw on the last day of the season ensured survival in Division Two. The 1950‚Äì51 season saw the signing of one of Leicester's greatest ever strikers, Arthur Rowley, from Fulham, who would become the club's top scorer in eight consecutive seasons. Rowley equalled Arthur Chandler's then club record of 38 goals in one season in the 1951‚Äì52 season, then broke it the following season, scoring 41 times. Thirty-nine of these came in the league where he won the Second division golden boot for the first time. Leicester won the Division Two championship in 1954 as Rowley netted 36 more. Although a woeful defensive record, conceding 86 goals saw them relegated straight back down from Division One the next season, they returned two years later in 1957, with Rowley breaking his own club record and scoring 44 goals in one season (this remains the club record still today) claiming the Second Division top scorer accolade once again. Although Leicester survived in their first season back in the First Division, Rowley was sensationally sold, just seven goals shy of Arthur Chandler's all-time record as the club's top goalscorer, to Shrewsbury Town at the end of 1957‚Äì58 season. The decision to sell him led to fan unrest and ultimately the sacking of David Halliday in November 1958. Matt Gillies (1958‚Äì1968) Former player Matt Gillies took over from Halliday with the Foxes lying in the relegation zone of the First Division and would go on to become arguably the club's most successful ever manager. Gillies became well known for his ability to spot a good player during his time at Filbert Street bringing through the ranks future FWA Footballer of the Year winners Gordon Banks and Frank McLintock and future PFA Player of the Year Peter Shilton, as well as club favourites Dave Gibson, Lenny Glover and Graham Cross. Leicester reached the FA Cup final twice under the stewardship of Gillies in 1961 and 1963. In 1961, they were on the losing side to double winners Tottenham, and as a result were England's representatives in the 1961‚Äì62 European Cup Winners' Cup in which Leicester were knocked out by eventual winners Atl√©tico Madrid in the first round. In 1963, Leicester chased the double. The coldest winter for decades meant Leicester were forced to play a backlogged fixture list on ice, then went on a then club-record 18-game unbeaten culminating in the club sitting atop the First Division on 16 April 1963, causing the press to label Leicester as the \\"ice kings\\". However, injuries (possibly feigned in light of the upcoming FA Cup final) eventually took their toll and Leicester took just one point from their final five games, seeing them fall to fourth position, though this was still the club's best post-war finish up until the 2015‚Äì16 season, where Leicester won the Premier League. They then lost the 1963 cup final 3‚Äì1 to Matt Busby's Manchester United. Gillies finally won silverware though in 1964. Leicester beat Stoke City 4‚Äì3 on aggregate to win the League Cup for the first time. Leicester also reached the League Cup final the following year, losing to Chelsea. In 1966, one of the club's most famous players, Gordon Banks, who played for eight years at Leicester, represented England at the FIFA World Cup, where he helped England become world champions and was also nominated for the Ballon d'Or, for European Football of the Year, still to this date, the only Leicester player to be nominated for that award. Leicester toured Zambia in the summer of 1968 only four years after Zambian independence, playing six games and winning them all, including three games against the Zambian national team and three games against representative XI sides. City's visit was described as \\"probably the greatest occasion in the history of association football in Zambia\\" by Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda. After a bad start to the season and a bout of illness, Matt Gillies resigned in November 1968. His successor, Frank O'Farrell, was unable to prevent relegation, but the club reached the 1969 FA Cup Final for the final time to date, losing to Manchester City 1‚Äì0. Their relegation in 1969 ended a twelve-year stint in the top flight, the club's longest to date. Jimmy Bloomfield (1971‚Äì1977) In 1971, Leicester were promoted to Division One, and won the Charity Shield for the first and only time against Liverpool. Unusually, due to Division One champions Arsenal's commitments in European competition, Division Two winners Leicester were invited to play FA Cup winners Liverpool, beating them 1‚Äì0. Jimmy Bloomfield was appointed for the new season, and his team remained in the First Division for his tenure. It included popular players such as Keith Weller, Frank Worthington and Alan Birchenall, who continues to play a role at the club today, particularly well known for presenting half-time entertainment. Leicester reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1974. No period since Bloomfield has seen the club remain in the top division for so long. Up and down (1978‚Äì1991) Frank McLintock, a noted player for seven years for Leicester successful period from the late Fifties to the mid Sixties, succeeded Jimmy Bloomfield in 1977. Due to City's relegation in at the end of the 1977‚Äì78 season and McClintock's subsequent resignation, he is regarded as one of Leicester's worst managers. Jock Wallace resumed the tradition of successful Scottish managers (after Peter Hodge and Matt Gillies) by steering Leicester to the Division Two championship in 1980. Unfortunately, Wallace was not able to keep Leicester in Division One, but they reached the FA Cup semi- final for the last time to date in 1982. Under Wallace, one of City's most famous homegrown players, Gary Lineker, emerged into the first team squad. Leicester's next manager was Gordon Milne, who achieved promotion in 1983. Lineker helped Leicester maintain their place in the First Division but was sold to Everton in 1985 and two years later Leicester went down, having failed to find a suitable replacement. Milne had left in 1986 and was replaced by in 1987 David Pleat, who oversaw one of the club's most unsuccessful periods in its history. He was sacked in January 1991 after a defeat that left City fourth from bottom. Gordon Lee was put in charge of the club until the end of the season. Leicester won their final game of the season which guided them clear of relegation to the third tier of the football league. The play-off battle (1991‚Äì1994) Brian Little, who had just taken Darlington from the Conference to the Third Division with successive promotions, was given the manager's job at Leicester and in his first season they qualified for the promotion playoffs. Leicester beat Cambridge United 6‚Äì1 on aggregate in the semi-finals, but lost out on a place in the new Premier League after a 1‚Äì0 defeat in the playoff final to Blackburn Rovers ‚Äì the only goal of the game was scored by Blackburn's Mike Newell, a former Leicester player. The goal, a penalty, came after a much disputed foul by Steve Walsh on David Speedie. Speedie became the subject of much hatred amongst Leicester City supporters, but signed for the club a year later. Leicester suffered another playoff final defeat at the end of the 1992‚Äì93 Division One campaign. They managed to draw level with Swindon in the second half after trailing 3‚Äì0, only to concede another controversial penalty. In 1993‚Äì1994 it was third time lucky for Leicester as they beat East Midlands rivals Derby County 2‚Äì1 in the final to secure promotion to the Premiership after seven years outside the top division. Striker David Speedie was suspended in the final, having been sent off in the semi-final. Relegation and promotion (1994‚Äì1996) Brian Little quit as Leicester manager the following November to take charge at Aston Villa, and his successor, Mark McGhee, was unable to save Leicester from finishing second from bottom in the 1994‚Äì95 Premiership campaign with just six wins from 42 league games. Leicester were flying high at the top of Division One when McGhee left the club unexpectedly in December 1995 to take charge at Wolverhampton Wanderers. McGhee was replaced by Martin O'Neill, who prior to his brief six-month spell as Norwich City manager had taken Wycombe Wanderers from the Conference to Division Two with two successive promotions. Under O'Neill, Leicester qualified for the 1995‚Äì96 Division One promotion playoffs and beat Crystal Palace 2‚Äì1 with a last-gasp Steve Claridge goal which secured an immediate return to the Premiership. O'Neill was recognised for both his ability in the transfer market, signing players like Neil Lennon, Muzzy Izzet, Tony Cottee and Matt Elliott, and the performances he elicited from the team. Success in the top flight (1996‚Äì2000) Leicester established themselves in the Premiership with four successive top ten finishes. O'Neill was the first manager to win silverware for 26 years, winning the League Cup twice, in 1997 and 2000, and Leicester were runners-up in 1999. This meant qualification for the UEFA Cup in 1997‚Äì98 and 2000‚Äì01, the club's first qualification for Europe since they played in the 1961‚Äì62 European Cup Winners' Cup. O'Neill became a sought-after manager, turning down Leeds United in 1999, but in June 2000 he was lured to Celtic. He is regarded today as one of the most successful managers in the club's history. In April 2000, the club received a record ¬£11 million from Liverpool for striker Emile Heskey. Downfall and fightback (2000‚Äì2004) Martin O'Neill was replaced by the former England under-21 national team coach Peter Taylor. For most of 2000‚Äì01, Leicester looked set to qualify for European competition, even topping the Premiership table for two weeks in October. However, they were then knocked out of the FA Cup quarter finals by Division Two side Wycombe, followed by nine defeats from their final ten Premiership fixtures which saw them slip to 13th in the table. A poor start to 2001‚Äì02 (a 5‚Äì0 defeat at home to newly promoted Bolton Wanderers) saw Taylor sacked after two months and replaced by David Bassett, who was unable to stop Leicester's season from going from bad to worse. In his 15 months at the club, Peter Taylor spent ¬£23 million on transfer fees alone, by far the most of any Leicester manager. Particularly notorious was the club record fee of ¬£5 million for Ade Akinbiyi, who scored 11 goals in 58 league appearances, and Dennis Wise, ¬£1.6 million for a 34-year-old who was later sacked for assaulting a teammate. Some also blame former chairman John Elsom for his poor handling of the club's finances. Just before relegation was confirmed, Bassett resigned to become director of football, to make way for his assistant Micky Adams, who had quit the manager's job at Brighton & Hove Albion six months earlier to become Bassett's assistant. Leicester's last game of the 2001‚Äì02 season was also their last at Filbert Street, beating Tottenham 2‚Äì1 to secure only their fifth Premiership win of the season. King Power Stadium from the Grand Union canal Leicester moved into the new 32,000-seat Walkers Stadium at the start of the 2002‚Äì03 season. Walkers, the crisp manufacturers, the club's former shirt sponsors acquired the naming rights for a ten-year period.Statement by the Foxes Trust on an unofficial forum In October 2002, the club went into administration with debts of ¬£30 million. Some of the reasons were the loss of TV money (ITV Digital, itself in administration, had promised money to First Division clubs for TV rights), the large wage bill, lower than expected fees for players transferred to other clubs and the ¬£37 million cost of the new stadium.BBC News, Leicester City put into administration, BBC News Business Section, 22 October 2002 Adams was banned from the transfer market for most of the season, even after the club was rescued by a takeover in February 2003 by a consortium led by Gary Lineker. Adams guided Leicester to runners-up spot in Division One and automatic promotion back to the Premiership with more than 90 points. In reaction to Leicester's restructuring of their debts, the Football League changed their rules and now penalise teams going into administration with a ten-point penalty. There was some bitterness from other clubs over this point, and because Leicester retained some good players from the Premiership (although several were sold). In an interview in mid-2006, chairman Andrew Taylor stated debt was about ¬£25 million, including a \\"mortgage\\" of ¬£15‚Äì18 million on the Walkers Stadium to the company (not the club) that owns it.Interview, from The Fox Summer Special 2006 Leicester were relegated from the Premiership in 2003‚Äì04 with 33 points, along with Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Stadium was renamed King Power Stadium in 2011 after the take-over of Thai-based duty free company King Power. Life in the Championship (2004‚Äì2008) Adams resigned as manager in October 2004 and Dave Bassett began a second (albeit temporary) spell as manager assisted by former FA technical director Howard Wilkinson. The pair remained in charge at Leicester until Craig Levein was appointed Leicester City boss on Friday 29 October 2004, who had previously been manager of Hearts. Levein was unable to attain anything higher than a 15th-place finish in the final table, Leicester's lowest in 14 years. Their dismal form continued into the 2005‚Äì06 season, which saw some fans call for Levein's resignation as the team were near the bottom of the table after ten matches, and fell into the relegation zone in January, ultimately leading to his sacking on 25 January 2006, despite a 3‚Äì2 FA Cup win over Premiership club Tottenham just 17 days earlier. After winning three out of four games as caretaker manager and moving the club five places up the league, Rob Kelly was appointed to see out the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager's job on a permanent basis. Jim McCahill retired as chairman on 1 June 2006 and was replaced by Andrew Taylor. The club was bought from the existing 55 shareholders by Milan Mandariƒá in February 2007. By this stage, they were mid- table in the Championship, too low to mount a promotion challenge but seemingly comfortably clear of relegation. A run of eight games without a win, however, plunged the club back to the fringes of the relegation battle, prompting Mandariƒá to sack Kelly on 11 April 2007. Nigel Worthington was appointed as manager for the remaining five games of the season, and under his management, a final position of 19th was achieved. On 25 May, Martin Allen was given a three-year contract to be the new permanent manager. His relationship with Milan Mandariƒá, however, deteriorated rapidly, and he left the club on mutual consent in August after just three months at the helm. Jon Rudkin, Steve Beaglehole and Mike Stowell took over as caretaker managers until 13 September, when Gary Megson was installed as their new permanent manager. But the managerial story took another twist when he walked out on 24 October to take over from the sacked Sammy Lee at Bolton. Frank Burrows and Gerry Taggart temporarily took charge until Ian Holloway was appointed as Leicester's third permanent manager of the season on 22 October, after resigning from Plymouth Argyle. Relegation to League One and return to the Championship (2008‚Äì2014) League One with a win at Southend. On 4 May 2008, Leicester City's 0‚Äì0 draw with Stoke City was not enough to save the club from relegation due to other results going against them. This means that Leicester played in League One during the 2008‚Äì09 season, the first time that Leicester had played in the third tier of English football. Ian Holloway was sacked and replaced by Nigel Pearson, who led Leicester straight to the League One title, leading the division for much of the season, also going a club record 23 league games unbeaten. They clinched their return to the Championship with three games remaining in the season, defeating Southend United 2‚Äì0 on 18 April 2009. Matty Fryatt also netted 32 times this season, becoming the first Leicester player to score over 30 goals in one season since the legendary Arthur Rowley did so 52 years previously. Leicester's first season back in the Championship was again a successful one under the stewardship of Pearson. Pearson showed his ambition at the beginning of the season by announcing his team would not just settle for consolidation and would be aiming straight for the play-offs. His ambitions proved to be warranted as the Foxes finished fifth in their first season back in the second tier and making the play-offs for the fifth time. They played Cardiff City in the semi-final and showed a fighting spirit to come from two goals down on aggregate to lead brief 3‚Äì2, though they ultimately lost via a penalty shoot-out. In the summer of 2010, however, Pearson left the club to become manager of Hull City. Pearson was replaced by Paulo Sousa, who was sacked after just nine league games after a poor start and questions about player fitness and morale had left Leicester bottom of the league. On 3 October 2010, former England, Lazio and Benfica manager Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson was announced as his replacement. He guided the club to an eventual tenth-place finish. Leicester were favourites for promotion in the 2011‚Äì12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of the first 13 games, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent. Three weeks later, on 15 November 2011, Nigel Pearson was confirmed to be returning to the club as Eriksson's successor. In the 2012‚Äì13 season, Leicester struggled with play-off heartbreak as Anthony Knockaert had a 97th-minute penalty saved and Troy Deeney scored immediately at the other end. After an extremely successful 2013‚Äì14 season, Leicester finished first in the ChampionshipLeicester City promoted to Premier League after 10-year absence, BBC Sport, 5 April 2014 with 102 points, securing automatic promotion for the 2014‚Äì15 Premier League. Return to the Premier League and first title (2014‚Äìpresent) Leicester started their first season in the Premier League since 2014 with two draws in their first three games, then claimed their first Premier League win since May 2014 with a 1‚Äì0 win against Stoke.Stoke 0‚Äì1 Leicester, BBC Sport, 13 September 2014 They went on to beat Manchester United 5‚Äì3, coming back from 3‚Äì1 down, to move into seventh place in the table, five places ahead of Louis van Gaal's United.Leicester 5‚Äì3 Man Utd, BBC Sport, 21 September 2014 By March, however, a dismal run of form had seen the team fall to last place with only 19 points (seven fewer than the 19th-placed team) from 29 games, but a change of fortunes meant that they finished the season in 14th place with a 5‚Äì1 victory over relegated Queens Park Rangers on the last day of the season.Leicester 5‚Äì1 QPR, BBC Sport, 24 May 2015 They thus completed, mathematically, the best escape from relegation ever seen in the Premier League as no team had previously had less than 20 points from 29 games and stayed up. Despite his success, Pearson was sacked in June 2015 after a breakdown in his relationship with the club's owners. He was replaced by former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/13/claudio-ranieri- appointed-leicester-city-manager Starting the 2015‚Äì16 season as relegation candidates, and quoted by William Hill at 5,000‚Äì1, Leicester improbably went on to win the title in one of the most extraordinary seasons in English football. Under Ranieri, the team made a flying start to the season, losing only one game in their first 15 and topping the table in December ahead of Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United. Striker Jamie Vardy, who four years previously had been playing non-league football at Fleetwood Town, scored in 11-straight Premier League matches, beating the record of ten set by Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2003. Having been bottom of the table at Christmas 2014, Leicester were top at Christmas 2015. Their form continued into 2016, and in February they beat second-placed Manchester City 3‚Äì1 away to go six points clear. For the remainder of the season, Leicester's main title rivals were Tottenham, and they clinched their first ever Premier League title, with two games to spare, on the weekend of 1‚Äì2 May when they drew 1‚Äì1 with Manchester United and Tottenham drew 2‚Äì2 with Chelsea. They also qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time.

Apostolic work In 1940, during the period of high responsibilities in the Diocese, after the sudden death of Mgr Giuseppe Depiro, Archbishop Caruana asked him to become the Director of the Institute and Orphanage of Jesus of Nazareth at Zejtun, a post at which he fulfilled his ambition to help the poor children and the needy until his death. During the same time he continued with his mission of hearing confessions regularly in Senglea, Zejtun and Tarxien where he joined his elder brother parish priest Salvatore. He dedicated himself to direct the newly born Congregation and to the apostolate of preaching on all occasions offered to him, and taking active part in the popular missions held by the Missjoni ≈º-≈ªgƒßira. (The Minor Missionary Movement) Further responsibilities During the most critical moments for Malta in World War II, on 9 June 1942, at the request of the old Archbishop Mauro Caruana, Pope Pius XII appointed Mgr Emanuel Galea Titular Bishop of Tralles in Asia and Auxiliary Bishop of Malta. He was ordained bishop by Archbishop Caruana assisted by Bishop Mikiel Gonzi (at that time Bishop of Gozo) at the Cathedral in Mdina on 5 July 1942. (This was during the continuous Luftwaffe blitz of the islands). Along with his duties at a high level of responsibility in Malta, Bishop Galea took part in a number of sessions of the Second Vatican Council that lasted from 1962 until 1965. He addressed the plenary and the individual specialized sessions in a masterly way and contributed especially to the discussions on the Episcopal Collegiality and on the role of the Church in the modern world. Later life He enjoyed visiting parishes all over Malta to confer the Sacrament of Confirmation, to install new parish priests and to take part in the liturgical celebrations of the parish titular feasts. He accepted joyfully to deliver Lenten sermons to all different sections wherever he was invited. Being an assiduous writer of short articles he used this ability to propagate the teachings of the Church on many occasions. Honors In 1943 he was made a Knight of the Order of Malta. In 1965, on the 50th Anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood, on the recommendation of Archbishop Gonzi, Pope Paul VI appointed Bishop Galea Assistant to the Papal Throne. In 1969, the Confederation of Civic Councils awarded him the Gold Medal of Merit by stating that over the previous 29 years, Mgr Galea had performed innumerable deeds to the spiritual and temporal benefit of the Maltese Islands. His last years Bishop Emanuel Galea continued his pastoral activities to the last days of his life; he passed peacefully away on 21 August 1974 after a short illness at the venerable age of 83 years. His remains were laid in state in his beloved Institute at Zejtun for the last farewell from the many that queued to show their respect. The funeral, attended by huge crowds and many priests, was led by archbishop Gonzi (who had since become Archbishop of Malta) at St John's Co-Cathedral and then he was buried in the Cemetery of St Gregory in Zejtun. He was later transferred to the Institute where he now lies buried in a marble sarcophagus. Monsignor Galea was a man of prayer and a great devotee of the Blessed Virgin. His Rosary beads were frequently seen in his hands. He spent daily long moments of Adoration before the Blessed Sacrament. Both as a priest and as a bishop he was known by all as the apostle of the confessional. He encouraged prayers for priests and the monthly night-adoration for their holiness. In character Mgr Galea was very reserved by nature and was hardly one to boast of his achievements and only a close circle of friends knew of those good deeds. Even during his lifetime, Mgr Galea was considered to be a saintly person. Since the destruction of Senglea during the Second World War he had lived mainly in Zejtun where his humble residence was always open to those that sought his advice and teachings. His sermons were always followed with utmost interest and people used to travel long distances to hear him preach. Many pray for his intercession with God for some special favour and there is a movement to have him elevated to the Altars as a Blessed Soul.

Biography At the beginning of his career in Saint Petersburg, he shared fourth place in 1908 (Sergey von Freymann and Karl Wilhelm Rosenkrantz won), tied for 10‚Äì11th in 1909 (Alexander Alekhine won), took second place behind Smorodsky in 1913, and shared first with von Freymann in 1914 (Hexagonal).http://www.anders.thulin.name/SUBJECTS/CHESS/CTCIndex.pdf Name Index to Jeremy Gaige's Chess Tournament Crosstables, An Electronic Edition, Anders Thulin, Malm√∂, 2004-09-01 Romanovsky participated in the Mannheim 1914 chess tournament (the 19th DSB Congress), began on 20 July and stopped on 1 August 1914 when World War I broke out. He tied for second/fourth in Hauptturnier B. After the declaration of war by the German Empire on the Russian Empire, eleven Russian players (Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubow, Fedor Bogatyrchuk, Alexander Flamberg, Koppelman, Maliutin, Ilya Rabinovich, Romanovsky, Saburov, Selesniev, Weinstein) were interned in Rastatt, Germany. On September 14, 17, and 29, 1914, four of them (Alekhine, Bogatyrchuk, Saburov, and Koppelman) were freed and allowed to return home via Switzerland. As an internee, he played in three tournaments. In 1914, he tied for fourth/fifth in Baden-Baden, as Flamberg won. He took third in the Triberg chess tournament 1914/15, and tied for fifth/sixth at Triberg 1915 (both won by Bogoljubow). After being released from internment by the Red Cross in spring 1915, due to his poor health (heart illness), he returned to Petrograd. When Romanovsky returned to Russia, he immediately helped raise money to aid the Russian chess players who were still interned in Germany by giving a simultaneous exhibition at the Saint Petersburg Polytechnical Institute. 1920‚Äì35 After the war, he took second, behind Alekhine, at Moscow 1920 (the first USSR Chess Championship). He was the Soviet Champion in 1923 (second USSR-ch in Petrograd) and 1927 (with Fedor Bogatyrchuk, fifth USSR Chess Championship, in Moscow). He tied for first with Grigory Levenfish, Alexander Ilyin-Genevsky and Ilya Rabinovich in the 1925 Leningrad City Chess Championship.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/al2055km/ch_repub/1925/ch_len25.html&date;=2009-10-25+12:11:12 In December 1925, he tied for seventh/eighth in the Moscow 1925 chess tournament. In 1927, he won in Leningrad. His best international result was in Leningrad 1934, finishing tied for second place with Nikolai Riumin, behind Mikhail Botvinnik.Russian Chess Base In 1935, he was the first Soviet chess player to be awarded Honored Master of Sport. Last years During the worst period of the Siege of Leningrad in winter of 1941‚Äì42, a rescue party reached his home. They found Romanovsky half-conscious from starvation and cold. The rest of his family had frozen to death. All the furniture in the house had been used for firewood. A chess manuscript which had been in preparation by Romanovsky was also lost at this time. He was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and the International Arbiter title in 1951. In 1954, the Soviets withdrew their application for Romanovsky to receive the Grandmaster title, which had been based on his first place in the 1927 USSR championship. But because anti-Stalinist Fedor Bogatyrchuk (Bohatirchuk) had shared the title in 1927, and he was no longer recognized in the USSR as the result of his having defected, the USSR Chess Federation did not want to give the GM title to Bohatirchuk, so they withdrew the application for Romanovsky as well. Before his death, Romanovsky published two books on chess middlegames, which were translated into English in 1990. These are Chess Middlegames: Combinations, and Chess Middlegames: Strategy, both published by American Chess Promotions.

The state highway runs from SR 36 at Fort Lee north to SR 145 at Centralia. SR 144's east-west segment is the main highway between Colonial Heights and both Fort Lee and Hopewell. The state highway's north-south section connects U.S. Route 1 and US 301 in Colonial Heights with SR 10 in Chester. It was first added to the state highway system in 1930 as State Route 425 (SR 425) and had gained its current routing and designation by 1987. Route description View south along SR 144 in Fort Lee SR 144 begins at a four-way intersection with SR 36 (Oaklawn Boulevard) at the northeastern corner of Fort Lee. The south leg of the intersection is Sisisky Boulevard, which serves as one of the entrances to the military base. SR 144 heads west as Temple Avenue, a four-lane divided highway that crosses a rail line and passes through an industrial area in far northern Prince George County before crossing the Appomattox River, which is split in two by Halls Island. While crossing the river, the state highway passes through a sliver of Chesterfield County before entering the independent city of Colonial Heights. SR 144 passes through a commercial area that includes the Southpark Mall and the world's largest Arby's restaurant. West of the mall, the state highway has a trumpet interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) (Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike) that is supplemented by a ramp from northbound SR 144 to northbound I-95. West of the freeway, SR 144 reaches the western end of Temple Avenue and turns north to run concurrently with US 1 and US 301 along the city's main north-south thoroughfare, Boulevard. SR 144, US 1, and US 301 follow Boulevard north through Colonial Heights, where the five-lane highway with center turn lane passes under CSX's North End Subdivision. The highways enter Chesterfield County by crossing Swift Creek into Chesterfield County and become Jefferson Davis Highway. SR 144 splits northwest from the U.S. Highways to follow two- lane Harrowgate Road through a suburban area to Chester. There, the state highway has a brief concurrency with four-lane SR 10 (West Hundred Road) to cross the North End Subdivision rail line. SR 144 continues north on two-lane Chester Road, which the highway follows to its northern terminus at SR 145 at Centralia. SR 145 heads west as Centralia Road toward Chesterfield Court House and north as a continuation of Chester Road through an interchange with the SR 288 freeway. History What would become SR 144 was first commissioned in 1930 as SR 425. It was significantly shorter than today's route, only running from State Route 407 in Chester to State Route 410 in Centralia. The route was given its current designation during the 1933 Virginia state highway renumbering. In 1943, it was extended west along SR 407 for a short length, then south to US 1 and US 301 using the routing of what was at the time State Route 621, a secondary road; the Commonwealth Transportation Board's justification for replacing it with SR 144 was that it was \\"a heavily traveled feeder road serving a rapidly developing portion of [Chesterfield County]\\". In 1987, SR 144 was again extended a total of ; first south along US 1 and US 301 from its previous terminus and then east along Temple Avenue to its current terminus at SR 36.

It was first published in 1802, but was expanded in several later editions, reaching its final state in 1830, two years before Scott's death. It includes many of the most famous Scottish ballads, such as Sir Patrick Spens, The Young Tamlane, The Twa Corbies, The Douglas Tragedy, Clerk Saunders, Kempion, The Wife of Usher's Well, The Cruel Sister, The D√¶mon Lover, and Thomas the Rhymer. Scott enlisted the help of several collaborators, notably John Leyden, and found his ballads both by field research of his own and by consulting the manuscript collections of others. Controversially, in the editing of his texts he preferred literary quality over scholarly rigour, but Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border nevertheless attracted high praise from the first. It was influential both in Britain and on the Continent, and helped to decide the course of Scott's later career as a poet and novelist. In recent years it has been called \\"the most exciting collection of ballads ever to appear.\\"  Contents  The contents of the 1812 edition were as follows:  Research  For Walter Scott, as his son-in-law J. G. Lockhart later wrote, compiling Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border was \\"a labour of love truly, if ever such there was\\". His passion for ballads went back to earliest childhood. While still an infant he had the ballad Hardiknute by heart, and would recite it at the top of his voice to the annoyance of all around him. As a ten-year-old he began collecting the broadsheet ballads that were still being sold on the streets, and his interest was further stimulated by his discovery, at the age of 13, of Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. \\"To read and to remember was in this instance the same thing\\", he later wrote, \\"and henceforth I overwhelmed my schoolfellows, and all who would hearken to me, with tragical recitations from the ballads of Bishop Percy.\\" His memory was prodigious, and by his own account it \\"seldom failed to preserve most tenaciously a favourite passage of poetry, a playhouse ditty, or, above all, a Border-raid ballad\\". In 1792 Scott turned to field research, making an expedition into the wilds of Liddesdale, in southern Roxburghshire, and taking down the words of traditional ballads from villagers, farmers and herds wherever he could find any who still remembered them, and in the next seven years he repeated these \\"raids\\", as he called them, seven times. In late 1799, impressed by the elegant work of the Kelso printer James Ballantyne, an old schoolfellow of his, the idea occurred to him of putting together a selection of ballads to be printed by him. This would satisfy his patriotic feelings in various ways, not just displaying the typographical prowess of a little-known Border town, but also preserving the folk-poetry of his beloved Scotland for the admiration of the world at large.  Editing  John Leyden, Scott's collaborator in the Minstrelsy Energetic as Scott's researches had been, he gained still more from the researches of other collectors he befriended or exchanged letters with. He gained access to several manuscript collections originating from the Borders and from north-east Scotland, notably those of Mrs Brown of Falkland, David Herd and Robert Riddell. He recruited assistants from widely different strata of society, including the wealthy and learned bibliophile Richard Heber, the lawyer Robert Shortreed, the literary antiquaries Robert Jamieson and Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, and later the farmer William Laidlaw and the shepherd-poet James Hogg. Of these the most invaluable, more a collaborator than an assistant, was John Leyden, a brilliant young linguist and poet who has been called \\"the project's workhorse and its architect\\". There have been criticisms of Scott for exploiting his helpers and for letting only his own name appear on the title-page, but all gave their help freely and were fully acknowledged in the body of the book. In the Minstrelsy Scott produced an eclectic edition, combining lines and stanzas from different versions of each ballad to produce what he thought the best version from a purely literary point of view. This approach would now be considered unscholarly, but Scott wanted his book to appeal to a general reading public which had little regard either for scholarship or for ballad texts in the raw state. In his later years he changed his mind on this point, and wrote that \\"I think I did wrong...and that, in many respects, if I improved the poetry, I spoiled the simplicity of the old song\\". One aspect of his editing has proved controversial over the years. Scott denied introducing any new material of his own into the ballads to patch over corrupt lines, saying \\"I have made it an invariable rule to attempt no improvements upon the genuine Ballads which I have been able to recover\\"; and again, \\"I utterly disclaim the idea of writing anything that I am not ready to own to the whole world\\". J. G. Lockhart took his claims at face value, but later commentators, from Francis James Child onwards, took a different view, so that it became commonplace to accuse him of writing not just lines of his own but even entire stanzas. However, more recent analyses of the texts by Keith W. Harry, Marryat Ross Dobie and Charles G. Zug have largely vindicated Scott's claims, showing that he was probably responsible for nothing more than an occasional word or phrase. The Minstrelsy began with a substantial general introduction with several appendices of documentary material, followed by the editions of the various ballads; each of these has an explanatory headnote which puts the ballad into its historical context, then the text of the ballad itself, and finally a set of explanatory notes. Originally Scott wanted to restrict himself to those ballads that celebrated the Border raids of the past, but he was drawn into including romantic ballads telling entirely unhistorical stories, and also modern imitations of the traditional ballads written by Scott and Leyden, and in later editions by Matthew Lewis, Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, Anna Seward and others. These three categories of ballad were clearly demarcated from each other in the Minstrelsy. For some while Scott intended to include the Middle English romance Sir Tristrem among the romantic ballads, convinced as he was that it was a Scottish production, but it proved so difficult and time-consuming to edit that he had to publish it separately in 1804, two years after the Minstrelsy had appeared. Likewise, one of his imitations of the ancient ballads expanded to such a length as he wrote it that it outgrew its intended place in the Minstrelsy and was instead published as The Lay of the Last Minstrel, laying the foundation of Scott's tremendous fame as an original poet.  Publication  The title-page of volume 2 of the first edition The first edition, printed by James Ballantyne and published by Cadell and Davies, appeared in two volumes in January 1802. The print-run was 800 copies and the price for most copies 18 shillings. It included 53 ballads. That edition took only six months to sell out, but a second one, with additions to all three categories bringing it up to 87 ballads, was published in three volumes by Longman and Rees in May 1803, priced at ¬£1 11s. 6d. This time there were 1000 copies of the first two volumes, and 1500 of the third volume, containing the \\"Imitations of Ancient Ballads\\". A third edition was published in 1806 and a fourth in 1810, each adding a few more ballads. The fifth edition, in 1812, added one more, bringing the final tally to 96 ballads, of which 43 had never before appeared in print. A second issue of this edition, published in 1830, added two substantial new essays by Scott. In 1833, following Scott's death, Lockhart produced another edition which included the music of nine of the ballads, making it the first collection to do such a thing. In 1837 he reported that there had been numerous American editions.Lockhart p. 103 T. F. Henderson's edition, first published in 1902, remained the reference edition of this work until the appearance in 2017 of Edinburgh University Press's three-volume Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, edited by Sigrid Rieuwerts.  Reception  James Hogg's mother Margaret was outraged by the Minstrelsy, and is said to have told him that the ballads she had recited for him \\"war made for singing an' no for reading; but ye hae broken the charm now, an' they'll never be sung mair\\". But others saw the book very differently. Scott received congratulatory letters from delighted literary figures such as George Ellis, Anna Seward, and George Chalmers, and even from the notoriously prickly antiquaries John Pinkerton and Joseph Ritson. Reviews of the Minstrelsy were also in general enthusiastic. The Scots Magazine said that it would \\"attract the attention of men of literature, not only in Scotland, but in every country which has preserved a taste for poetical antiquities, and popular poetry\\". It admired the notes, and ranked the work alongside Percy's Reliques. The British Critic praised the \\"taste and learning\\" displayed in this \\"elegant collection\\". The Edinburgh Review thought the Minstrelsy \\"highly interesting and important to literature\\", and found much to praise in Scott's notes, not to mention Ballantyne's printing. Poetical merit, it judged, \\"is here attained in a very eminent degree\\", while warning that \\"We are not...to view these poems as...highly-polished and elaborate specimens of art; but as exhibiting the true sparks and flashes of individual nature\\". Only the critic in the Monthly Review dissented. He had little time for rude and unpolished Scottish ballads, protested that \\"the taste of the age calls for models more correct and refined\\", and lamented that \\"it was decreed that Mr. Scott should publish these volumes, and that Reviewers should be doomed to read them\\". But even he admired the section of Imitations, praised the \\"fidelity, taste and learning\\" displayed in the editing, and admitted that the notes throw some light on the country's history. For many later readers, as Andrew Lang wrote, \\"Scott composed 'a standard text', now the classical text, of the ballads which he published\\". Comparisons are often made with Percy's Reliques. The Scott scholar Jane Millgate thought the Minstrelsy had a unity and coherence not found there, but A. N. Wilson nevertheless found himself preferring the Reliques: \\"[I]n terms of range, [Scott] surpassed Bishop Percy, but not in that nebulous, odd art which can make an anthology a companion for life. We still keep Percy's Reliques, not Scott's Minstrelsy, on the bedside table.\\" In the 20th century the Minstrelsy had a controversial reputation among academic writers on the folk tradition because of its failure to meet modern standards of scholarship, but they have nevertheless acknowledged the ability of Scott's editorial method to capture something of the essence of the Scottish ballad. Jane Millgate admired \\"his ability not only to draw on the skills of very different men and organize the most diverse kinds of material but also to appear, almost simultaneously, in several guises ‚Äì as antiquarian, scholar, historian, critic, and poet\\". T. F. Henderson called it \\"one of the great monuments of Scottish literature\\", and the literary historian David Hewitt has called it \\"the most exciting collection of ballads ever to appear.\\"  Influence  Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border exercised a powerful influence on both British and European literature, not least on Scott himself. His first efforts as a writer had been translations of German Sturm und Drang poems, together with one or two original pieces in the same lurid manner. His experience as a ballad-editor did a great deal towards purifying his taste and turning him towards a more simple and natural style. His experience of working with both the English and Scots languages, with narrative verse and critical and historiographical prose, and integrating them together, was to prove formative on his original works, steeped as they are both in the spirit of the Scottish oral tradition and in his own experience of antiquarian commentary on it. It also furnished him with abundant subject-matter, and indeed Lockhart claimed that \\"In the text and notes of this early publication, we can now trace the primary incident, or broad outline of almost every romance, whether in verse or in prose\\" of his career as a creative writer. It has been shown that his novel Old Mortality, for example, derives its setting and much of its action, personnel and motivation from two Minstrelsy ballads, The Battle of Loudon Hill and The Battle of Bothwell Bridge. As the scholar H. J. C. Grierson wrote, the Minstrelsy was \\"the tap-root of Scott's later work as a poet and novelist\\". With the publication of the Minstrelsy, the ballad finally became a fashionable and respectable form, increasingly displacing the Burnsian type of lyric poem in literary favour. James Hogg was one of those who responded to this shifting of the market by trying to surpass the imitations of ancient ballads in its third volume. One of the consequences of Scott's use of the phrase Scottish Border in his title, in spite of the fact that many of his ballads came from north-east Scotland, was to popularize the still current fallacy that the Borders rather than the north-east were the richest source of Scottish ballads. Most ballad editors of the 19th century and later, such as William Motherwell and Francis James Child, practised strict fidelity to one source, but Scott's example of preferring collation was followed by some of his successors, and can be seen in William Allingham's Ballad Book, Arthur Quiller-Couch's Oxford Book of Ballads, and Robert Graves's The English Ballad and English and Scottish Ballads. Across Europe the publication of the Minstrelsy was an inspiration to literary nationalists. It was translated into French, Danish and Swedish, and individual ballads from it into Czech and Hungarian. There were two German translations of the Minstrelsy: one by Henriette Schubart, and another by , Willibald Alexis and Wilhelm von L√ºdemann. Wilhelm Grimm rendered two of its ballads into German, Theodor Fontane another, and the Minstrelsy profoundly influenced Fontane's own ballads. Most importantly, perhaps, the publication of the Minstrelsy was the main impulse that led Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim to produce their famous collection of German folk-poems and legends, Des Knaben Wunderhorn, itself the inspiration for the collections of other folklorists and the source of musical settings by some of the greatest composers of the 19th century.

In 2006 he was recognized as a Distinguished Engineer by the Association for Computing Machinery, and in 2007 he was made a Fellow of the ACM. He is the 2009 recipient of the Stevens Award for \\"outstanding contributions to the literature or practice of methods for software and systems development.\\" He received a Simon Rockower Award in 2011 from the American Jewish Press Association.  Work  Constantine specializes in the human side of software development. His published work includes the influential classic text, Structured Design, written with Ed Yourdon, and the award-winning \\"Software for Use\\", written with Lucy Lockwood. His contributions to the practice of software development began in 1968 with his pioneering work in \\"Modular programming\\" concepts. Constantine was the primary force behind the discipline of Structured Design, in his book of the same name. The key features of Structured Design, such as Structure Chart, the Data flow diagram are all commonly used and taught worldwide.  Structured design  Constantine, who learned programming at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, began his professional career in computers with a summer job at Scientific Computing, at the time a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation, in Minneapolis. He went on to full-time work at MIT‚Äôs Laboratory for Nuclear Science, where he wrote routines for analyzing spark chamber photographs, and then to C-E-I-R, Inc., where he worked on economics simulations, business applications, project management tools, and programming languages. While still an undergraduate at MIT he began work on what was to become structured design, formed his first consulting company, and taught in a postgraduate program at the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School. The core of structured design, including structure charts and coupling and cohesion metrics, was substantially complete by 1968, when it was presented at the National Symposium on Modular Programming. He joined the faculty of IBM‚Äôs Systems Research Institute the same year, where he taught for four years and further refined his concepts. As part of structured design, Constantine developed the concepts of cohesion (the degree to which the internal contents of a module are related) and coupling (the degree to which a module depends upon other modules).Lee, International Bibliographical Dictionary of Computer Pioneers. These two concepts have been influential in the development of software engineering, and stand alone from structured design as significant contributions in their own right. They have proved foundational in areas ranging from software design to software metrics, and indeed have passed into the vernacular of the discipline. Constantine also developed methodologies that combine human-computer-interaction design with software engineering. One methodology, usage-centered design, is the topic of his 1999 book with Lucy Lockwood, \\"Software For Use\\". This is a third significant contribution to the field, being both well used in professional practice and the subject of academic study, and taught in a number of human-computer interface courses and universities around the world. His work on human-computer interaction was influential for techniques like essential use cases and usage-centered design, which are widely used for building interactive software systems.  Family therapy  Constantine trained under family therapy pioneers David Kantor and Fred and Bunny Duhl at the Boston Family Institute, completing a two-year post-graduate certificate program in 1973. From 1973 to 1980 he was an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry in the Tufts University School of Medicine training family therapists and supervising trainees at Boston State Hospital. He became a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and later a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in Massachusetts and was designated an Approved Supervisor by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy. His contributions to theory and research in family therapy and human systems theory were summarized in Family Paradigms (Guilford Press, 1986), a book heralded at the time as ‚Äúone of the finest theoretical books yet published in the family therapy field‚ÄùContemporary Psychology: APA Review of Books and ‚Äúamong the most significant developments of the decade.‚ÄùBurr, W.

He sang with the award-winning Burtones ensemble while a student at MIT, is a twelve-year veteran and alum of the semi- professional Zamir Chorale of Boston, and is a member of the Zachor Choral Ensemble, a Boston-based group dedicated to keeping alive the memory of the Holocaust through music. Constantine is also a composer with several major works to his credit.

It is set in a different fictional timeline from Drury's 1959 novel Advise and Consent, which earned him a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The novel was out of print for several years until WordFire Press reissued it in paperback and e-book formats in 2014. Plot summary Young, idealistic Mark Coffin wins a surprise, upset election victory, turning the 30-year-old Stanford University professor into the junior senator from California. Additionally, in the concurrent presidential election, his party's presidential candidate rides Mark's coattails to corral California's electoral votes and the White House. Mark has studied politics as a professor but has never run for office. However, his father-in-law is Jim Elrod, a powerful senior senator from North Carolina and chairman of the Armed Services committee, and Mark's father owns one of the largest newspapers in the state. Indeed, his own wife, who had wanted Mark to run, is fearful because of the election results: the new President will want to show that he owes nothing to Mark by making his life difficult. Mark goes to Washington amid the glare of the media spotlight, and reporters Bill Adams, Chuck Dangerfield and Lisette Greyson take an interest in his career from the start, praising him as one of the most idealistic and promising senators to hit town in decades. Other Senate wives warn Mark's wife that Lisette has tried to seduce several married Senators. Mark's hopes of sitting on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are damaged when he takes strong positions on two hot button issues: his father-in-law's bill to add ten billion dollars to the defense appropriation, to be used to try to catch up with the Soviets; and the Attorney General nomination of Charlie Macklin, the tough D.A. of Los Angeles County, whom Mark considers a demagogue that runs roughshod over civil liberties. He also makes an enemy of the governor of California, who had pushed Coffin's candidacy, as the governor had also suggested Macklin to the new President. Older senators who agree with him warn him to tread lightly, but Mark feels that he must make a stand on the issues he promised his supporters to fight for. Mark leads other junior senators in bucking the Washington establishment on these two issues. These so-called \\"Young Turks\\" include Rick Duclos of Vermont, who has an eye for the ladies and a teenage son, and Bob Templeton of Colorado, who recently lost his family in a plane accident. When Mark will not soften his opposition, he loses the committee assignment to Duclos. During the celebrations of the President's inauguration, a mere 17 days after Mark himself took office, he gets extremely drunk because of the bitterness he feels at the setback. He goes to Lisette's apartment, and later returns home. At first it seems that no one knows, but then it slowly leaks out. A furor ensues, with Lisette apparently milking the story for her own advantage. His wife is devastated. Mark thinks he has already failed in his mission and considers resigning. However, his wife, her father, and her father's girlfriend, who is also a powerful Senator, are all political animals, and unite to get him through the problems he has caused. Macklin uses the story in his own confirmation hearings to try and discredit Mark, but ends up insulting a number of Senators. His nomination is narrowly defeated. On the defense appropriations fight, his own father-in-law effectively beats back his opposition. Mark has now won one fight and lost another, and he goes on to an effective career, but his failure at the beginning is brought up at critical moments for the rest of his life. Series Later Drury books in the same timeline are The Hill of Summer (1981) and The Roads of Earth (1984), a two- part series dealing with a major crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union. Drury's 1977 novel Anna Hastings is also set in the same timeline, with its title character Anna appearing in a supporting role in The Hill of Summer and The Roads of Earth.

(2011) Oprah: The gospel of an icon. University of California Press. p 42. He is best known for his contributions to the New Thought movement through his book The Master Key System. Personal life and business career The Haanel family was of Swedish extraction, but had lived in Silesia, Prussia, before emigrating to Canada and thence to the United States. In St. Louis: History of the Fourth City, the author Walter B. Stevens wrote that \\"Charles F. Haanel was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of Hugo and Emeline (Fox) Haanel.\\" He was the fourth of six children. According to Stevens, \\"The family moved to St. Louis, Missouri when Charles was a child. His first job was as an office boy for the National Enameling & Stamping Company in St. Louis, and he worked for this firm in varying capacities for fifteen years before striking out on his own as a writer and businessman.\\" In 1885 he married Esther M. Smith. They had one son and two daughters. In 1891 his wife died. In 1908 he married for the second time, to Margaret Nicholson of St. Louis, whose father was W. A. Nicholson. He was a member of the Republican Party, a Freemason and Shriner affiliated with St. Louis Keystone Lodge No.243, (A.F. & A.M.) and a supporter of the Missouri Athletic Club. He was a member of Pi Gamma Mu fraternity, a Fellow of the London College of Psychotherapy, a member of the Authors League of America; a member of the American Society of Psychical Research; a member of the Society of Rosicrucians; a member of the American Suggestive Therapeutical Association; and a member of the Science League of America. During his life, Haanel earned and received several honorary academic degrees, including hon. Ph.D., College National Electronic Institute; Metaphysics, Psy. D., College of Divine Metaphysics; and M.D., Universal College of Dupleix, India. When Haanel died on November 27, 1949; he was 83 years old. His ashes were buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery, St. Louis.  Career as financial success writer  Haanel's book The Master Key System was published in 1912, when he was 46 years old. It is written in the form of a course in New Thought, mental development, financial success, and personal health. The book was heavily promoted in the pages of Elizabeth Towne's New Thought magazine The Nautilus. By 1933 it had allegedly sold over 200,000 copies worldwide. Haanel practiced the financial principles he preached, and was a self made success who owned several major companies. According to Stevens, writing in 1909, \\"He was president of the Continental Commercial Company, president of the Sacramento Valley Improvement Company, and president of the Mexico Gold & Silver Mining Company.\\" The original Master Key System contained 24 parts or modules of study. The allegedly \\"lost\\" chapters of the Master Key System, chapters 25-28, which are found in some editions, are not original, but have been copied from the chapters 11-14 of A book about You. Among the key points of Haanel's system are what he refers to as the laws of concentration, attraction, and harmonious thinking and action. Unique to the Master Key System is a set of exercises that accompany each chapter, and which are systematically building upon each other -- they are what makes the Master Key System a system. Another important aspect of the Master Key System is the element of \\"Truth\\". The understanding of \\"Truth\\" is derived from the understanding that Spirit is all there is, and that it cannot be other than perfect. Truth provides readers/students with certainty, courage and determination to change their life for the better. In addition to the Master Key System, Haanel wrote several other books including Mental Chemistry, published in 1922, The New Psychology, published in 1924, A Book about You, published in 1927, and The Amazing Secrets of the Yogi, co-authored with Victor Simon Perera and published in 1937. Influence on other writers In 1919, Napoleon Hill wrote Haanel a letter thanking him for The Master Key System. In the letter Hill stated, \\"My present success and the success which has followed my work as President of the Napoleon Hill Institute is due largely to the principles laid down in The Master-Key System.\\" Haanel was quoted in the best-selling self- help book The Secret by Rhonda Byrne, published in 2007.

Outside Argentina he is considered one of the most important exponents of Rock en Espa√±ol, specially in the 1980s when he along with Charly Garcia, Soda Stereo, Enanitos Verdes, Virus, Sumo, Fabulosos Cadillacs, Rata Blanca, and many more bands became international stars in the so-called \\"Argentinian Invasion\\" (\\"La Ola Argentina\\") of rock music that swept Latin America and parts of North America and Europe. It helped popularize Spanish-language rock outside Argentina, and make the genre a commercially successful industry.  History  Miguel Mateos/Zas in 1982: Miguel Mateos, Fernando Lupano, Ricardo Pegnotti and Alejandro Mateos. He became involved in music since he was 15 years of age. In 1979, he and his brother Alejandro formed the underground rock band ZAS. The following year he managed to contact Queen frontman Freddie Mercury and gain a spot on stage as the opening act for the British group for their Buenos Aires concerts. He turned ZAS into one of the most important Argentine rock bands of the early 80s. In 1986, Mateos recorded in the United States his first solo album (officially, but in practice he still used members of ZAS as supporting band). With a much more polished sound, and greater pop accessibility than the ZAS works, Mateos jumped on the crest of the wave of Argentine rock acts that dominated the 1986-1988 period all over Latin America, Spain, and elsewhere. Solos en Am√©rica was considered a watershed album containing cuts that would become classics of Rock en Espa√±ol from that time, including the homonymous track, \\"Cuando Seas Grande\\", and \\"Mi Sombra en la Pared\\". Riding a wave of massive popularity in Mexico, Mateos introduced the slogan \\"Rock en tu Idioma\\" (Rock In Your Language) in 1987. He began touring that nation, introducing along the way local acts such as Caifanes and Maldita Vecindad, among others. All those groups would become major acts in their own right within a short period. In the 1987-1988 Mateos toured Latin America to sell-out stadiums.Miguel Mateos Biography www.terra.com.mx (Spanish). Retrieved July 18, 2020 He was among the first Rock en Espa√±ol acts to receive active support from fledgling MTV International. The 1990s would be a period of continued solo success for Mateos and his now adult-pop rock music across the Spanish- speaking world, though ironically he would drop in popularity in his homeland. In general, what in the rest of Latin America is considered rock, in Argentina tended to be seen as pop. This has sometimes led to cultural confusion about how to categorize the current Miguel Mateos musical output, as outside Argentina Mateos remains an iconic figure of the Rock en Espa√±ol movement.

He is associated with the great Istabraq, on whom he won three Champion Hurdles. He was twice top jockey at the Cheltenham Festival and was champion National Hunt jockey in Ireland for nine consecutive years. After retiring as a jockey he spent several years a trainer, based in Modreeny near Cloughjordan, County Tipperary. First and only son to Donald Swan, a former British Army Captain, and his wife Teresa, Charlie was named after an ancestor who was the surgeon to the British King 'Bonnie Prince Charlie'. He rode his first winner as a fifteen-year-old, on his father‚Äôs Final Assault, in a two-year-old maiden at Naas in March 1983, and, after a successful spell as an apprentice, he later turned his attention to the National Hunt scene. He won his first Irish jockeys' championship in 1989/90 and retained the title up to and including the 1997/98 season. He was only deposed as champion Irish rider after deciding to concentrate on his training career. Swan holds the Irish records for the most winners in a season (147 in 1995/96) and the most in a calendar year. Away from Cheltenham, numerous big-race winners have come his way, including Ebony Jane in the Irish Grand National and the Whitbread Gold Cup at Sandown Park on Ushers Island and Life Of A Lord.  Cheltenham  Swan's first Cheltenham festival winner was Trapper John in the Stayers Hurdle in 1990. He was twice leading jockey at the Cheltenham Festival, 1993 and 1994. He will always be associated with Istabraq, who won at the festival four years in a row, but other memorable wins were Danoli's Royal & Sun Alliance Hurdle and Viking Flagship's Queen Mother Champion Chase.Cheltenham Festival victories as a jockey ;Cheltenham Victories 1990 Stayers Hurdle Trapper John 1993 Supreme Novices' Hurdle Montelado 1993 Stakis Final Fissure Seal 1993 Triumph Hurdle Shawiya 1993 Stayers Hurdle Shuil Ar Aghaidh 1994 Royal & Sun Alliance Hurdle Danoli 1994 Coral Cup Time For A Run 1994 Champion Bumper Mucklemeg 1995 Queen Mother Champion Chase Viking Flagship 1996 Royal & Sun Alliance Hurdle Urubande 1997 Royal & Sun Alliance Hurdle Istabraq 1998 Champion Hurdle Istabraq 1999 Champion Hurdle Istabraq 2000 Champion Hurdle Istabraq 2000 Champion Bumper Joe Cullen 2002 Supreme Novices Hurdle Like-A-Butterfly 2002 Triumph Hurdle Scolardy  Istabraq  He will be forever associated with the legendary gelding Istabraq on which he rode to victory 23 times over hurdles including three consecutive renewals of the Champion Hurdle (1998 to 2000), four Irish Champion Hurdles (1998‚Äì2001) and big race wins at Aintree, Leopardstown and Punchestown. He won the 1997 Royal and Sun Alliance Hurdle when sent off a 6/5 fav. Istabraq sweated up badly before the race and Charlie rode a masterful race, getting him settled at the very back of a large field, then resisting the urge to make up ground going uphill before battling to victory by a length. In 1998 it was more straightforward as Istabraq won the Champion Hurdle going right away up the hill to win by 12 lengths. He confirmed his superiority by winning again in 1999 and 2000. He was the ante post favourite for the 2001 Champion Hurdle, but the Foot and Mouth outbreak caused the 2001 festival to be abandoned. Despite just one unconvincing run and plenty of rumours about Istabraq's fitness before Cheltenham, there was still a late flood of money for the great horse in 2002. But Istabraq was never right and Charlie had to pull him up in front of the stands. Nevertheless, both horse and rider were given a tremendous ovation by the crowd.  Trainer  Based in Cloughjordan, Charlie Swan took out a trainer's licence in 1998, taking over from his father, Donald Swan. He operated as both jockey and trainer for a few years until having his final ride on Aintree Grand National Day in April 2003. In the last eight seasons or so, he has managed to notch up nearly 270 winners as a trainer. Big successes have included This Is Serious (2001 Thyestes Chase at Gowran Park and 2002 Tote Eider Chase at Newcastle), No Discount (second in the 2000 Sun Alliance Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham), Anxious Moment (2002 Powers Gold Label Handicap Hurdle at Fairyhouse and 2003 Craddockstown Novice Chase at Punchestown), Ground Ball (2005 Dan Moore Memorial Handicap Chase at Fairyhouse), What A Native (four straight victories in 2005/6 including the Porterstown Chase at Fairyhouse and the Pierse Leoaprdstown Chase). His biggest win to date came in 2007 when One Cool Cookie took the grade one Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse. This was followed by another big prize when Emmpat won 2 days later at the same venue.

From 1993 to 2011 he held the position of Professor of Geological Sciences at the University of Durham, and from 1998 to 2011 was Master of University College, Durham. Education Tucker graduated with a First Class Honours degree in geology from the University of Durham (University College, Durham) in 1968. This was followed by a Ph.D in sedimentology from the University of Reading in 1971. Career Following lecturerships at the University of Sierra Leone and Cardiff University, he moved to Newcastle University in 1975. In 1982 he was appointed lecturer in geology at Durham University and became Reader in 1988. He was made a professor in 1993. Tucker's research interests focus on the properties of sedimentary rocks, particularly limestones, their formation and usefulness as an oil reservoir. He has written or edited more than eight books, including the standard undergraduate text Sedimentary Petrology, and Carbonate Sedimentology. He has served as President of the International Association of Sedimentologists and was awarded the prestigious Coke Medal of the Geological Society of London in 1994. He has also acted as the external examiner for the Earth Sciences degree at Oxford University. In addition, he has served as Staff Treasurer for the Assassins' Guild of the University of Durham since the end of the 1990s. University College, Durham Maurice Tucker was Master of University College, Durham from 1998 to 2011, and in the last formal dinner of the Easter Term 2010 his portrait by Andrew Ratcliffe was unveiled, to be hung in the Great Hall. The portrait features a fossil that he found at the age of 7 in the family back garden at Newbury Park, which began his fascination with geology. As an undergraduate student he himself was a member of the college between 1965-1968. He was awarded college colours for representing Castle at table tennis. He is well acquainted with the traditions of the students within the college, and is highly respected by Castlemen, with many of his youthful escapades spoken of as myth within college. In the Epiphany term of 2009 he took part in the Lumley Run, never having completed it as a student, completing it in 1 hour 22 minutes. While Master, he inhabited the entirety of the large house at the base of the Keep, along with his wife - regularly entertaining students in his garden in the summer months. He was known as being a staunch supporter of the JCR and MCR, and maintained a strong involvement with them. On the occasion of his retirement in the summer of 2011, the MCR renamed their common room (previously the William St Calais room) the Maurice E Tucker room in his honour.

This behavior is implemented by a plugin or an activex control, depending on the browser. The first two numbers of the version roughly follow the Sun Java numbering convention. It means that for instance Jinitiator 1.3.1.25 is based upon JDK 1.3 or later. The main reason for Oracle to develop Jinitiator was to support Oracle Forms on the web in earlier releases due to bugs in earlier releases of the JDK. In 2007 Oracle announced, that for the upcoming release of Forms version 11, Jinitiator would no longer be needed and that users should migrate to the Sun Java plug-in. In January 2010, a product obsolescence desupport notice was posted saying that JInitiator would no longer be supported and that all users should upgrade. Since version 10.1.2.0.2 of Forms in 2010, Oracle began working closely with Sun to completely phase out Jinitiator.

If these divisions are all part of the same company, then that company is legally responsible for all of the obligations and debts of the divisions. However, in a large organization, various parts of the business may be run by different subsidiaries, and a business division may include one or many subsidiaries. Each subsidiary is a separate legal entity owned by the primary business or by another subsidiary in the hierarchy. Often a division operates under a separate name and is the equivalent of a corporation or limited liability company obtaining a fictitious name or \\"doing business as\\" certificate and operating a business under that fictitious name. Companies often set up business units to operate in divisions prior to the legal formation of subsidiaries. Generally, only an \\"entity\\", e.g. a corporation, public limited company (plc) or limited liability company, etc. would have a \\"division\\"; an individual operating in this manner would simply be \\"operating under a fictitious name\\". Examples Technology An example of this would be to look at Hewlett Packard (HP), the computer and printer company. HP has several divisions, with the printer division, that makes laser and inkjet printers, being the largest and most profitable division. The divisions of HP, like the Printing & Multifunction division, the Handheld Devices (includes the old calculator) division, the Servers division (mini and mainframe computers), etc., all use the HP brand name. But, Compaq (a part of HP since 2002), operates as a subsidiary, using the Compaq brand name. Another less obvious example is that Google Video is a division of Google, and is part of the same corporate entity. But the YouTube video service is a subsidiary of Google because it remains operated as YouTube, LLC, a separate business entity even though it is owned by Google. Automotive Mack Trucks continues to run itself separately, but is a wholly owned subsidiary of AB Volvo. Volvo Trucks also sells trucks under the Volvo name. Within Mack, there is a division named Mack de Venezuela C.A. that does final assembly and sells trucks in South America. Financial Services In the banking industry, an example would be OneWest Bank and its relationship with CIT Bank. CIT Bank is the retail banking segment of financial services company CIT Group. OneWest Bank, although a separate legal entity, is classified as being a division of CIT Bank. OneWest continues to use its own logo and has a branch of retail banks in Southern California, but for the purposes of running its business and reporting financial results, CIT Group consolidates all OneWest Bank activity into CIT Bank. In addition to its OneWest Bank division, CIT Bank includes an online bank.

He was educated at Hanson Boys' Grammar School, Bradford, and entered the theatre in his late teens, appearing on both the British and American stage throughout his career. He made his film d√©but in East Lynne on the Western Front (1931) and appeared in supporting roles until he took the lead in The Terror (1938). In arguably his most celebrated film role, he played dustman-turned-lecturer Alfred P. Doolittle in the film version of George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion (1938), alongside Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller. He also had memorable leading roles in Pastor Hall (1940), as a German village clergyman who denounces the new Nazi regime in 1934; Tower of Terror (1941) as the wild-eyed maniacal lighthouse keeper Wolfe Kristen; and the title role in The Great Mr. Handel (1942), a biopic of the 18th century composer, all three showing his broad range. He also made a number of films in America beginning with Ladies in Love (1936) and including John Ford's The Long Voyage Home (1940) alongside John Wayne. His last leading role was in The Turners of Prospect Road (1947). As a result of bouts of alcoholism, Lawson became difficult to work with, and throughout the 1950s his roles became increasingly small‚Äîeven uncredited in some cases. Despite this he still gave memorable performances such as Prince Andrei Bolkonsky's father in King Vidor's War and Peace (1956), Ed in Hell Drivers (1957) and Uncle Nat in Room at the Top (1958), filmed in Lawson's home town of Bradford. The 1960s saw something of a career resurgence, beginning with his turn as Black George in Tony Richardson's Tom Jones (1963) and culminating in two of his most notable latter day performances: the decrepit butler Peacock in The Wrong Box and the Dormouse in Jonathan Miller's television adaptation of Alice in Wonderland (both 1966). That same year saw his death, in London, from a heart attack. His brother was the supporting player Gerald Lawson (born Bernard Worsnop, 30 April 1897 ‚Äì 6 December 1973) and a nephew was actor Bernard Fox (born Bernard Lawson, 10 May 1927 ‚Äì 14 December 2016).

Early career  He was the oldest son of (Samuel) Theodore Mander (of a cadet branch of the prominent Mander family of Midland industrialists and public servants) and his wife, Flora St Clair Paint. Mander's younger brother was actor, playwright and film director Miles Mander. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, served in the Royal Flying Corps in World War I, and was called to the bar at the Inner Temple (1921).  Politician  He entered the House of Commons as the Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Wolverhampton East at the general election in May 1929. He was a Liberal specialist on foreign policy between the wars, and was one of the first to take a strong stand against Appeasement of the fascist dictators, and was a crusader on behalf of the League of Nations. During World War II, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Archibald Sinclair (later, first Viscount Thurso), the Secretary of State for Air. He won a reputation in Parliament for his determined use of parliamentary questions. For example, just over a month after the formal establishment of the Peace Pledge Union on 22 May 1936, he asked the first of numerous hostile questions about it on 25 June 1936.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1936/jun25/peace-pledge-union Wolverhampton East was one of the last urban constituencies which the Liberals managed to hold against both Labour Party and Conservative Party opposition up to 1945. Mander was expected to be nominated Chief Whip for the Liberal Party in the House of Commons, but he lost his seat at the 1945 general election, in the post-war Labour landslide. Considering that Labour had now replaced the Liberals as the main representative of the radical tradition in British politics, he joined the Labour party in 1948, and subsequently served as a Labour member of the Staffordshire County Council. Among many public offices, he was High Sheriff of Staffordshire (1921), a county councillor, justice of the peace, and was made a Knight Bachelor for public services in the 1945 New Year Honours shortly before his enforced retirement from Parliament.  Industrialist  He was chairman of Mander Brothers (established in 1773) for a generation, one of the principal local employers and a major manufacturer of paints, inks and varnishes in the British Empire. As an industrialist, he led many progressive initiatives in the field of labour relations and employment welfare between the Wars. Under his direction, Mander Brothers was the first British company to introduce the 40-hour week through an historic agreement signed and mediated by Ernest Bevin, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, in September 1931.  Art patron  He was an early conservationist. He offered to buy for the nation William Morris's Red House in London, if a suitable tenant could be found. He did present the family house, Wightwick Manor, in Staffordshire, with its outstanding collections of Victorian art and objects associated with William Morris, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Arts and Crafts movement to the National Trust in 1937. It was the first country house to be so presented during the lifetime of its donor. His second wife, Rosalie Glynn Grylls, was a biographer with an interest in the writers and artists of the Romantic period and an early connoisseur of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. Her biographical subjects included Mary Shelley (1938), Claire Clairmont (1939), Edward John Trelawny (1950), William Godwin (1953), Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1964), Ivy Compton-Burnett (1971) and Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1980). Together Geoffrey and Rosalie Mander were influential in the overdue reassessment of the artists and writers of the Victorian period. Personal life Mander was married twice. His first marriage was to Rosalind Florence Caverhill. They had three children: * Mervyn Caverhill Mander * Mavis Flora Rosalind Mander * Elizabeth Brehaut Mander His second marriage was to Mary Rosalie Glynn Grylls. Their wedding took place in the House of Commons, where Liberal MP Edgar Granville served as best man. The couple had two children: * John Geoffrey Grylls Mander (1932-1978) * Anthea Loveday Veronica Mander (1945-2004); married John Lahr in 1965.

The R&B; Best Sellers in Stores chart ranked records based on their \\"current national selling importance at the retail level\\", based on a survey of record retailers \\"with a high volume of sales in rhythm and blues records\\" and the Most Played R&B; by Jockeys chart ranked songs based on the \\"number of plays on disk jockey radio shows\\" according to a weekly survey of \\"top disk jockey shows in all key markets\\". With effect from the October 20 issue of Billboard the magazine discontinued both charts and combined sales and airplay into one chart called Hot R&B; Sides, which has been published continuously since that date, currently under the title Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs. In the issue of Billboard dated January 6, Danny & the Juniors were at number one on the Best Sellers chart with \\"At the Hop\\" and Ernie Freeman held the top spot on the Jockeys chart with \\"Raunchy\\". Two weeks later, Freeman's single was replaced at number one by Bill Justis's recording of the same tune. In an unusual turn of events, three different acts had recordings of the same track in the upper reaches of the charts at the same time. The two versions of \\"Raunchy\\" were among nine singles which reached number one on the Jockeys chart but failed to top the Best Sellers listing. Conversely, four songs which reached the peak position on the sales chart did not top the airplay-based listing. \\"Yakety Yak\\" by the Coasters had the year's longest unbroken run at number one on the Best Sellers chart, spending six consecutive weeks in the top spot. The Silhouettes had the longest uninterrupted run atop the Jockeys chart, spending six weeks in the peak position with \\"Get a Job\\"; \\"Yakety Yak\\" also spent six weeks at number one on that listing, but not consecutively. The \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", Elvis Presley, gained his final R&B; number one in 1958 when \\"Wear My Ring Around Your Neck\\" topped the Jockeys chart. Presley had achieved several R&B; number ones over the preceding two years, but as his music moved away from his rock and roll roots and into more sedate directions in the early 1960s he would experience less success on the R&B; chart, and after 1963 he would not enter the listing again. In contrast to Presley's lengthy and hugely successful career, both the Silhouettes and the Elegants reached number one in 1958 with the only singles of their respective careers to enter any of Billboards charts: both \\"Get a Job\\" and \\"Little Star\\" topped both R&B; charts as well as the magazine's all-genre listings, but neither of the two doo-wop groups would ever chart again. The final number one on the Best Sellers chart was \\"It's All in the Game\\" by Tommy Edwards, and the last chart-topper on the Jockeys listing was Bobby Day's \\"Rock-in-Robin\\". The following week, Day's song became the first number one on the combined Hot R&B; Sides chart. The year's final R&B; chart-topper was \\"Lonely Teardrops\\" by Jackie Wilson, which reached the peak position in the issue of Billboard dated December 15 and stayed there for the remainder of the year.

Madison's ZIP Code is 95653 and its area code 530. It is located west of Woodland, at an elevation of 151 feet (46 m). The 2010 United States census reported Madison's population was 503. History The Cache Creek post office opened in 1852, moved and changed its name to Madison in 1877. The name was bestowed by Daniel Bradley Hulbert after his hometown, Madison, Wisconsin. The townsite was laid out and named \\"Madison\\" in 1877 when the railroad, the Vaca Valley and Clear Lake Railroad, reached that spot, as the terminus, after expanding north from Winters. The Cache Creek Post Office had been located in the settlement of Cottonwood, approximately one mile south of Madison. Many of Cottonwood's structures were then moved to Madison, as Cottonwood did not have a railroad stop. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 1.547 square miles (4.007 km), all of it land. Demographics At the 2010 census Madison had a population of 503. The population density was 325.1 people per square mile (125.5/km).

There were 9 (6.7%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 1 (0.7%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 16 households (11.9%) were one person and 5 (3.7%) had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 3.71. There were 109 families (80.7% of households); the average family size was 4.14. The age distribution was 155 people (30.8%) under the age of 18, 55 people (10.9%) aged 18 to 24, 130 people (25.8%) aged 25 to 44, 120 people (23.9%) aged 45 to 64, and 43 people (8.5%) who were 65 or older. The median age was 28.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 113.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.9 males. There were 141 housing units at an average density of 91.1 per square mile, of the occupied units 86 (63.7%) were owner-occupied and 49 (36.3%) were rented.

Overview A representation of a value using binary scaling is more precise than a floating-point representation occupying the same number of bits, but typically represents values of a more limited range, therefore more easily leading to arithmetic overflow during computation. Implementation of operations using integer arithmetic instructions is often (but not always) faster than the corresponding floating-point instructions. A position for the 'binary point' is chosen for each variable to be represented, and binary shifts associated with arithmetic operations are adjusted accordingly. The binary scaling corresponds in Q (number format) to the first digit, i.e. Q1.15 is a 16 bit integer scaled with one bit as integer and fifteen as fractional. A Bscal 1 or Q1.15 number would represent approximately 1.999 to ‚àí2.0. To give an example, a common way to use integer arithmetic to simulate floating point, using 32-bit numbers, is to multiply the coefficients by 65536. Using binary scientific notation, this will place the binary point at B16. That is to say, the most significant 16 bits represent the integer part the remainder are represent the fractional part. This means, as a signed two's complement integer B16 number can hold a highest value of \\\\approx 32767.9999847 and a lowest value of ‚àí32768.0. Put another way, the B number, is the number of integer bits used to represent the number which defines its value range. Remaining low bits (i.e. the non-integer bits) are used to store fractional quantities and supply more accuracy. For instance, to represent 1.2 and 5.6 as B16 one multiplies them by 216, giving 78643 and 367001 as the closest integers. Multiplying these together gives 28862059643 To convert it back to B16, divide it by 216. This gives 440400B16, which when converted back to a floating-point number (by dividing again by 216, but holding the result as floating point) gives 6.71997 approximately. The correct result is 6.72. Re- scaling after multiplication The example above for a B16 multiplication is a simplified example. Re-scaling depends on both the B scale value and the word size. B16 is often used in 32 bit systems because it works simply by multiplying and dividing by 65536 (or shifting 16 bits). Consider the Binary Point in a signed 32 bit word thus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 S X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X where S is the sign bit and X are the other bits. Placing the binary point at * 0 gives a range of ‚àí1.0 to 0.999999. * 1 gives a range of ‚àí2.0 to 1.999999 * 2 gives a range of ‚àí4.0 to 3.999999 and so on. When using different B scalings and/or word sizes the complete B scaling conversion formula must be used. Consider a 32 bit word size, and two variables, one with a B scaling of 2 and the other with a scaling of 4. 1.4 @ B2 is 1.4 * (2 ^ (wordsize-2-1))  1.4 * 2 ^ 29  0x2CCCCCCD Note that here the 1.4 values is very well represented with 30 fraction bits. A 32 bit floating-point number has 23 bits to store the fraction in. This is why B scaling is always more accurate than floating point of the same word size. This is especially useful in integrators or repeated summing of small quantities where rounding error can be a subtle but very dangerous problem when using floating point. Now a larger number 15.2 at B4. 15.2 @ B4 is 15.2 * (2 ^ (wordsize-4-1))  15.2 * 2 ^ 27  0x7999999A The number of bits to store the fraction is 28 bits. Multiplying these 32 bit numbers give the 64 bit result This result is in B7 in a 64 bit word. Shifting it down by 32 bits gives the result in B7 in 32 bits. 0x1547AE14 To convert back to floating point, divide this by Various scalings may be used. B0 for instance can be used to represent any number between ‚àí1 and 0.999999999. Binary angles Binary scaling (B0) representation of angles. Black is traditional degrees representation, green is BAM as a decimal number and red is hexadecimal 32 bit representation of the BAM. Binary angles are mapped using B0, with 0 as 0 degrees, 0.5 as 90¬∞ (or \\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\pi), ‚àí1.0 or 0.9999999 as 180¬∞ (or ), and ‚àí0.5 as 270¬∞ (or \\\\tfrac{3}{2}\\\\pi). When these binary angles are added using normal two's complement mathematics, the rotation of the angles is correct, even when crossing the sign boundary; this conveniently does away with checks for angles ‚â• 360¬∞ when handling ordinary angles (data that allow angles with more than one rotation must use some other encoding). The terms binary angular measurement (BAM) and binary angular measurement system (BAMS) as well as brads (binary radians or binary degree) refer to implementations of binary angles. They find use in robotics, navigation, computer games, and digital sensors. No matter what bit-pattern is stored in a binary angle, when it is multiplied by 180¬∞ (or ) using standard signed fixed-point arithmetic, the result is always a valid angle in the range of ‚àí180 degrees ( radians) to +180 degrees ( radians). In some cases, it is convenient to use unsigned multiplication (rather than signed multiplication) on a binary angle, which gives the correct angle in the range of 0 to +360 degrees ( radians or +1 turn). Compared to storing angles in a binary angle format, storing angles in any other format inevitably results in some bit patterns giving \\"angles\\" outside that range, requiring extra steps to range- reduce the value to the desired range, or results in some bit patterns that are not valid angles at all (NaN), or both. Application of binary scaling techniques Binary scaling techniques were used in the 1970s and 1980s for real-time computing that was mathematically intensive, such as flight simulation and in Nuclear Power Plant control algorithms since the late 1960s. The code was often commented with the binary scalings of the intermediate results of equations. Binary scaling is still used in many DSP applications and custom made microprocessors are usually based on binary scaling techniques. The Binary angular measurement is used in the STM32G4 series built in CORDIC co-processors. Binary scaling is currently used in the DCT used to compress JPEG images in utilities such as GIMP. Although floating point has taken over to a large degree, where speed and extra accuracy are required, binary scaling works on simpler hardware and is more accurate when the range of values is known in advance and is sufficiently limited. This is because all the bits in a binary scaled integer are used for the precision of the value (though there may be leading zeros if the range of values is large), whereas in floating point, some bits are used to define the scaling.

Etymology A 19th-century Yiddish slang word with limited usage is generally accepted as the origin. In German, the verb means to \\"weave\\", while means to \\"rip\\" or \\"shred\\". Textile mills of that period were crammed with loud, complicated and wildly active machinery.Technology Dictionary Usage During the 1940s, the inventor Alfred J. Gross, a pioneer of mobile communications, made an association of the word with modern technology. Gross invented the walkie-talkie and developed cordless remote telephone signaling (the precursor to the pager). He was the father of Citizens' Band radio, and for his \\"handle\\" he used the pseudonym \\"Phineas Thadeus Veeblefetzer\\". A few years later, Harvey Kurtzman brought the word into popular usage in his comic book Mad. Over time, the word became a recurring running gag or catchphrase in the magazine, appearing in many articles by different authors. In Wallace Wood's parody, \\"Smilin' Melvin\\", in Mad 7 (October-November 1953), the airplane mechanic Thatstuff advises Smilin' Melvin not to \\"push down on the veeble-fetzer switch that starts the motor.\\" Will Elder's parody, \\"Frank N. Stein\\", was \\"set in the little European town of Veeblefetzer\\" in Mad 8 (December 1953). In the Kurtzman and Elder satire of the comic strip Gasoline Alley, titled \\"Gasoline Valley!\\", in Mad 15 (September 1954), the character Skizziks opens a shop to repair cracked veeblefetzers. In subsequent issues, Kurtzman used the word for spoofs of big business, with the fictitious corporation \\"North American Veeblefetzer\\" featured in satires of in-house company newsletters, corporate annual reports and more. In 1980, Alan Moore used the word in the British magazine 2000AD in the story \\"Ro-Jaws' Robo Tales: Final Solution\\" while the character Abelard Snazz is designing police robots. In 1997, Don Rosa used the word in the Donald Duck story \\"An Eye for Detail\\", in which Donald goes to work in Scrooge McDuck's veeblefetzer factory. Brutus Thornapple's boss in The Born Loser comic strip is Mr. Veeblefester, an obvious derivative. The word has been mentioned in films such as Mad Monster Party? (1966), The Magnificent Major (1978) and Reel Horror (1985); and on television's Boardwalk EmpireBoardwalk Empire episode 17, \\"Gimcrack & Bunkum\\" (2011) and Space Ghost Coast to CoastSpace Ghost Coast to Coast episode 62, \\"Warren\\" (1998).

It was her ninth novel, and her most successful, selling over 15 million copies.Famous Authors (Jackie Collins) Hollywood Wives tells the stories of several women in Hollywood, ranging all the way from long-time talent agents and screenwriters to vivacious screen vixens and young, innocent newcomers. After the novel's international success, it was adapted as a television miniseries by producer Aaron Spelling that aired on ABC in February 1985. It was a ratings hit, and one of the most successful mini-series of the 1980s. Collins went on to pen several more \\"Hollywood\\" titled books, including Hollywood Husbands (1986), Hollywood Kids (1994), Hollywood Wives: The New Generation (2001), and Hollywood Divorces (2003). Although these further novels tend to be separate works rather than direct sequels, characters from the original Hollywood Wives have made brief appearances in them. Main characters * Elaine Conti - a Bronx girl turned Hollywood hostess who is desperate to stay at the top while her marriage to former screen sex symbol Ross Conti crumbles beneath her. She is a compulsive shoplifter who lives in Beverly Hills. Elaine is a woman ruthlessly driven to improve both her husband's career and her own standing within Tinseltown. * Marilee Gray - Elaine's close friend and the first wife of director Neil Gray. She lives a life of leisure, paid for by her ex-husband's alimony. * Karen Lancaster - the daughter of super celebrity George Lancaster. Also one of Elaine's friends, but that does not stop her from making a play for Elaine's husband Ross Conti. * Sadie LaSalle - a Hollywood casting agent and starmaker who was responsible for Ross Conti's stardom. Now one of the most powerful women in Hollywood, Sadie eventually discovers Buddy Hudson. * Ross Conti - a one-time screen legend, but now a faded Hollywood star. Ross is about to turn 50 and is without a viable career. * Neil Gray - a top British film director and recovering alcoholic. * Jason Swankle - a top interior designer who also runs a male escort agency which caters to lonely rich women. * Bibi Sutton - another Hollywood society hostess and gossip. * Montana Gray - a talented screenwriter who is determined to break the glass ceiling of Hollywood studios. She is Neil Gray's second (and current) wife. * Gina Germaine - already a successful movie star, she is willing to do anything to advance her career and be taken seriously as an actress, including blackmail. * George Lancaster - a beloved Hollywood superstar and a contemporary of Ross Conti's but still successful. * Oliver Easterne - an arrogant, abrasive Hollywood studio boss. * Buddy Hudson - a young, aspiring actor and former hustler with ambitions of stardom regardless of his past life and his new bride. * Angel Hudson - Buddy's new wife. Her youth, beauty and innocence make her a target for some of Hollywood's more unscrupulous characters. * Pamela Lancaster - the second wife of Hollywood star George Lancaster and the stepmother of Karen Lancaster. * Deke Andrews - a mentally deranged young man from Philadelphia, who makes his way to Hollywood to find his birth parents, leaving a trail of death and destruction in his wake. * Det.

Jos√© Javier de Baqu√≠jano y Carrillo de C√≥rdoba, III Count of Vistaflorida (March 12, 1751, Lima, Peru--January 24, 1817, Seville, Spain) was a Spanish/Peruvian economist and jurist, writer and politician, and one of the first great intellectuals of the Viceroyalty of Peru. He was the second son of Juan Bautista de Baqu√≠jano y Urigoen, I Count of Vistaflorida, and Mar√≠a Ignacia Carrillo de C√≥rdova y Garc√©s de Mansilla. Baqu√≠jano inherited the Vistaflorida title from his older brother in 1809, becoming 3rd Count of Vistaflorida. Baqu√≠jano earned a doctorate in law from the University of San Marcos in Lima. In 1773-76 he traveled to Spain, where he met Pablo de Olavide and Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos. Upon his return to Peru, he took on the task of protector of the Indigenous, and became a professor of law. El elogio a J√°uregui He was celebrated for his speech welcoming the new viceroy Agust√≠n de J√°uregui to Lima in 1780. This was published in 1781 as El elogio a J√°uregui, and was mixed with strong criticism of the viceregal government. His veiled attack on the economic and Indigenous policy of Visitador (Royal Inspector) Jos√© Antonio de √Åreche was unprecedented. He quoted Montesquieu, Raynal, Machiavelli y Las Casas in defense of his positions. √Åreche called his doctrines \\"execrable\\". The Argentine Balthasar Maciel attempted a rebuttal of the speech. Economic thought Baqu√≠jano was a mercantilist economic thinker, although he was also influenced by the English economist Josiah Child, a qualified exponent of free trade. Baqu√≠jano believed that free trade and the separation of the Viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata were the causes of the economic crisis in Peru at the end of the eighteenth century. He supported the position that the Peruvian economy depended on the export of precious metals. Academic and literary work He led a reformist group at the University, arguing for the replacement of Scholasticism with the thought of men such as Descartes, Newton and Juan Heinecio. This group also supported the Encyclopedists and freedom of the press. In 1783 Baqu√≠jano lost an election for rector. Thus he was not able to put his reforms into effect in the University, but he did so in the Colegio de San Carlos. He became vice-rector of San Marcos in 1791. From 1791 to 1795 he was editor of the Mercurio Peruano, which rejected the radicalism of the French Revolution. In the Mercurio, Baqu√≠jano published histories of the Audiencia of Lima, of the University, and of the mines in Potos√≠, as well as a dissertation on the economy of Peru. In 1793 he became president of the Sociedad Acad√©mica de Amantes del Pa√≠s (Academic Society of Lovers of the Country). Politics He returned to Spain for some years around this time. In C√°diz he became friends with Bernardo O'Higgins. He was the mentor of a Criollo political movement seeking autonomy for the colony and equality between Criollos and Peninsulares. Back in Lima, he became oidor (judge) of the Audiencia in 1807. Also that year he became third count of Vistaflorida. In 1814 he was in Madrid, and that year he became a magistrate of the Council of the Indies. Later he became an honorary council member. He criticized the Spanish policy against the insurgents in Peru, calling it foolish and arguing for an end of hostilities. Yet he was a loyalist in his way, not a separatist. He argued for judicial, ecclesiastical and economic autonomy, but under the Crown of Spain. Still, his strong criticism of the viceregal system and his support of liberal principles lent support to the independence movement. For that reason, he is recognized as a precursor of Peruvian independence. References * Riva Ag√ºero, J. de la, \\"Jos√© Baqu√≠jano y Carrillo\\", in Historia del Per√∫, vol.

Plot Rafael is a women's clothing clerk at a large Madrid department store, Yeyo's. His department is filled with beautiful, comely young women whom Rafael routinely seduces. When Rafael vies for a management position with Don Antonio, a men's clothing clerk whom Rafael despises, a fluke causes Don Antonio to win the promotion. He fires Rafael and a fight ensues in which Rafael accidentally kills Don Antonio. Lourdes, an ugly and unassuming clerk at the store, witnesses the outcome of the fight, helps Rafael incinerate the body, and provides an alibi for the police. Rafael wins his coveted promotion, but at a terrible cost: Lourdes blackmails Rafael into an unwanted relationship. He is forced to fire his many former lovers, to marry Lourdes (she proposes on a live reality TV show) and to support clown- like women's clothing of her design. Rafael becomes so depressed he begins to hallucinate, seeing the ghost of Don Antonio who suggests Rafael should kill Lourdes.

The term was coined by writer and critic Brian W. Aldiss in a pseudonymous column in October 1965 issue of New Worlds. The term is a pun on the phrase shaggy dog story. A typical shaggy God story might feature a pair of astronauts landing on a lush and virgin world and in the last line their names are revealed as Adam and Eve. The television show The Twilight Zone used several versions of this, the most notable being \\"Probe 7, Over and Out\\". Another classic example is Isaac Asimov's 1956 short story \\"The Last Question\\" which ends with the protagonist supercomputer exclaiming \\"Let there be light!\\" The creation of the term is often misattributed to Michael Moorcock. Moorcock edited the issue of New Worlds where Aldiss coined the term in a pseudonymous column. It has been suggested that many assumed Moorcock to be the author of the column. The issue was cleared up in an August 2004 David Langford column in SFX magazine. The genre as a clich√© Brian Stableford noted in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction that a frequently written, but rarely printed, story submitted to science-fiction magazines features a male and female astronaut marooned on a habitable planet and ‚Äúreveal[s] (in the final line) that their names are Adam and Eve.‚Äù Among the \\"partial list of overworked ideas that should be strenuously avoided\\" that H. L. Gold of Galaxy Science Fiction in 1953 warned prospective writers of were \\"the characters we have been reading about are Adam and Eve or Jesus, the creation of a miniature universe in a laboratory by a scientist whose name turns out to be an anagram of Jehovah\\". \\"Dr. Peristyle\\" (Brian W. Aldiss) of New Worlds wrote in 1965 that \\"The shaggy god story is the bane of magazine editors, who get approximately one story a week set in a garden of Eden spelt Ee-Duhn\\".New Worlds, October 1965. The genre is also listed as a clich√© in the Science Fiction Writers of America's Turkey City Lexicon and David Langford's SFX magazine column on same. Will Ferguson references the clich√© extensively in his novel Generica (2001). Expansions of the term Shaggy God themes can be seen as an effort to harmonize religious accounts about the origin of human beings with science fiction tropes such as alien races, interstellar travel, genetic manipulation, the uplift of primitive races and man's place in the galactic life cycle. David Brin's Uplift Universe is a series of science fiction works that deal with the idea of advanced intergalactic cultures who identify proto-sentient species and genetically manipulate them into star-faring cultures in their own right (often enslaving them for thousands of years as payment). In the novels, proponents of the view that humans were uplifted by a galactic culture (as opposed to evolving into sentience) are called ‚ÄúD√§nikenites.‚Äù 2001: A Space Odyssey was called this by film critic John Simon. One interpretation of David Bowman's entrance into the EVA pod before entering space (the new Eden) to become a Star Child suggests Adam and Eve and the dawn of new man. Some people interpreted David Bowman transforming into the Star Child as his turning into a god or godlike being. The plot also involves an alien intelligence \\"creating\\" modern man by improving upon mankind's hominid ancestors. Douglas Adams's The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, a sequel to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, parodies the Shaggy God story with a subplot where the planet Golgafrincham comes up with a scheme to rid itself of its useless workers, such as telephone sanitizers and insurance salesmen, by sending them off in a space ark that eventually lands on the prehistoric Earth. The marooned telephone sanitizers, insurance salesmen, and other blissfully ignorant societal rejects are thought to have driven the indigenous Neanderthal-like race to extinction to themselves become the ancestors of modern Homo sapiens, until the sequel reveals otherwise.

The title of producer Ben Rekhi's CarBabes comes from the term car salesmen use for each other. He realizes that some might suspect otherwise, but promises \\"it's in no way a bikini car wash movie\\". The film is a coming-of-age comedy starring Boy Meets Worlds Ben Savage as a recent college grad living at home who reluctantly goes to work at his dad's car dealership. \\"The original idea emerged from stories our co-writer Blake Dirickson entertained us with about working for his father on his car lot\\", say co-directors Nick Fumia and Chris Wolf, who jack up their film's tension with the threat of a hostile takeover and the requisite romantic interest. The soundtrack ranges from hip-hop to country. CarBabes had its premiere on December 26, 2006. Overview Directed and produced by five Bay Area filmmakers, CarBabes is the first feature-length film written, directed, and produced by all five filmmakers, who channeled their love for the art of making films to produce this slapstick comedy. CarBabes directors (l to r) Chris Wolf and Nick Fumia talk to actor David Shackelford (seated) before filming. The idea for the film was conceptualized by Blake Dirickson, 27, who is one of the writers of the film. He said he gained the inspiration for the film from a used car lot in Santa Clara, where he worked for 18 months. He would often share stories with his friends about the car babes he worked with. He pitched the concept to first-time filmmakers Chris Wolf, 27, Nick Fumia, 27, Ben Rehki, 28, and Liz Destro, 27, and they loved the idea. \\"The biggest challenge we faced with this project was convincing friends and strangers to invest in a group of filmmakers who didn't have much under their belts in the realm of filmmaking,\\" Wolf said. \\"It was the most emotionally and physically draining thing I've ever done and I loved every minute of it,\\" said Fumia. The 35mm CarBabes, was shot at Moore Pontiac & Buick in Los Gatos, California, for 26 days late Summer, 2005, with feature film cinematographer Oden Roberts. Co- starring in CarBabes are Jon Gries, Blake Clark, Donnell Rawlings, Carolina Garcia and David Shackelford. For Ben Savage the attraction was the dynamic between the father and son and the struggle for the son to grow from a boy into a man. \\"It focused on something my friends and I are going through,\\" the recent Stanford graduate explains. \\"Like that two- or three-year period right out of college where everything's a possibility, everything's terrifying. You don't really have any sense of stability. It's the first time you're out on your own in life and I think that's such an interesting time.\\" Savage is in almost every scene of the film and he appreciates the level of collaboration involved. \\"Working with these guys, it really makes you feel like it's a group project. They're all young (and) they are very open and receptive to everyone's ideas. It's a really great set to be around.\\" Having to put the film together on a \\"spit and glue\\" budget (an industry term for low budget), covering 126 days of script in 26 days, caused the cast to improvise and adjust along the way, according to Wolf. He said it is under these circumstances, however, that the most creative things happen. Much like the car babes they portray in the film, Wolf said being a filmmaker also starts and ends with the ability to sell yourself. He said CarBabes is a stepping- stone to something bigger for each of the filmmakers. \\"Watching a little dream turn into something that is essentially immortal and the experience of creating something that starts on piece of paper and ends up on the big screen is really rewarding,\\" Wolf said. Plot Ford Davis, a 24-year-old recent college graduate with no direction in his life, is forced to live with his parents and work for his dad, Big Len, at his car dealership to pay off a loaner car he damaged. On the lot, Ford quickly learns that the game of car sales is not easy. His only saving grace becomes his co-workers, the heartwarming and irreverent CarBabes, who teach him that selling cars is about selling yourself. After an unforgettable test drive with a self-assured hairdresser, Ford begins to gain confidence not only selling cars, but with his new sexy girlfriend. But back on the lot, mobile home tycoon Ron Hamper, owner of the neighboring Hamper‚Äôs Campers, has his evil eye on Big Len's property. After an uncalled-for visit, Hamper threatens to shut Big Len down and turn Davis Automotive into a parking lot for his used campers. With the days at Davis Automotive numbered, Big Len and the CarBabes have all but given up, but Ford comes up with an idea to save the dealership. Using the wisdom he has gained from his father and the rest of the team, Ford concocts one final plan: a blowout sale to sell 300 cars in a month. Cast CarBabes of the title are (l to r) John Campo, Marshall Manesh, Ben Savage, Donnell Rawlings and David Shackelford. * Ben Savage as Ford Davis * Jon Gries as Gary * Blake Clark as \\"Big Len\\" Davis * Donnell Rawlings as Julius Jefferson * Kevin Blackton as Ron Hamper * Stephanie Keeney as Judy Gary * Arj Barker as Jimmy * David Shackelford as Pat Skis * John Campo as Dicky Deluna * Marshall Manesh as Babu Gulab * Carolina Garcia as Alicia Santos * Amy Resnick as Linda Davis Home media Car Babes was released in Region 1 DVD on June 10, 2008, by Vivendi Visual Entertainment.

It occurs when a triggering event causes the ejection of a large portion of the star's mass. Stellar mass loss can also occur when a star gradually loses material to a binary companion or into interstellar space. Causes A number of factors can contribute to the loss of mass in giant stars, including: *Gravitational attraction of a binary companion *Coronal mass ejection-type events *Ascension to red giant or red supergiant status Gravitational mass loss Often when a star is a member of a pair of close-orbiting binary stars, the tidal attraction of the gasses near the center of mass are sufficient to pull gas from one star onto its partner. This effect is especially prominent when the partner is a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. Mass ejection Certain classes of stars, especially Wolf-Rayet stars are sufficiently massive and distended that their hold on their upper layers is rather weak. Often, events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections will then be sufficiently powerful to blast some of the upper material into space. Red giant mass loss Stars which have entered the red giant phase are notorious for rapid mass loss. As above, the gravitational hold on the upper layers is weakened, and they may be shed into space by violent events such as the beginning of a helium flash in the core. The final stage of a red giant's life will also result in prodigious mass loss as the star loses its outer layers to form a planetary nebula.

Originally published for adults, it described a contemporary teenage romance and drew a large teenage audience. It is regarded by some as the first young adult novel, although the concept of young adult literature was not developed until the 1960s, more than twenty years later. At age 16, Daly also wrote an award-winning short story, \\"Sixteen\\", that appeared in many anthologies. Although Daly did not publish another novel for 44 years after Seventeenth Summer, she had a long career in journalism from the 1940s through the 1990s, working at the Chicago Tribune, Ladies' Home Journal, The Saturday Evening Post, and The Desert Sun in addition to doing freelance work. While at the Tribune, she wrote a popular syndicated advice column for teenagers that was later taken over by her younger sister, Sheila John Daly. She also wrote nonfiction books for adults and teenagers, and story books for children. In the 1980s and early 1990s, she authored two more young adult novels dealing with themes of romance. She was one of the four \\"Daly sisters\\" (the others being Maggie, Kay, and Sheila John) whose successful careers in media, fashion and business were covered by national magazines during the 1940s and 1950s. She also co-wrote some books with her husband, mystery and crime author William P. McGivern. Early life Maureen Daly was born March 15, 1921 in Castlecaulfield, County Tyrone, Ulster, Ireland to Joseph Desmond Daly, a bicycle shop owner, and his wife Margaret Kelly Daly, who according to a Life magazine profile on the family was a distant cousin of banker Andrew Mellon and a descendant of Mary, Queen of Scots. Maureen was the third daughter born to the Dalys, who already had daughters Marguerite, known as Maggie, and Kathleen, known as Kay. At the time of Maureen Daly's birth, Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In May 1921, the partition of Ireland took place and County Tyrone became part of the newly created Northern Ireland. To escape the effects of the Irish War of Independence, Joseph Daly decided the family would emigrate to the United States. He moved to the US in 1921, and the rest of his family had joined him there by 1923, when Maureen Daly was aged two. The youngest Daly daughter, Sheila John, was born in the United States. The family settled in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and Maureen Daly became a naturalized American citizen. Career Daly regularly published work for over five decades, starting in the 1930s when she was still in high school. Although she is best known for the fiction she wrote as a teenager, most of her career was spent as a journalist and writer of non-fiction. In the 1960s, she also wrote several books for young children. \\"Sixteen\\" and Seventeenth Summer Daly was encouraged to write by her high school English teacher. At age 15, Daly entered her short story entitled \\"Fifteen\\" in a competition sponsored by Scholastic; the story placed third. The following year, when Daly was 16, she won first prize in the same Scholastic competition with her story \\"Sixteen\\" about a girl who meets a boy at a skating rink. \\"Sixteen\\" also received an O. Henry Award in 1938, and went on to be published in at least 300 anthologies and in 12 languages. Daly said in a 1986 interview that she was still receiving royalty checks for the story. Daly began writing her first novel, Seventeenth Summer, when she was 17, but did not finish it until several years later, while she was attending Rosary College. She entered it in an intercollegiate novel contest sponsored by publisher Dodd, Mead and won first prize. The novel, about a seventeen-year- old girl's experience of first love during one summer, was published by Dodd in 1942 while Daly was still in college. It drew critical praise, including an essay by Orville Prescott in The New York Times placing Daly in a group of literary \\"Rising Stars\\" alongside Eudora Welty, Nelson Algren, Howard Fast, Mary O'Hara and others. Seventeenth Summer became a bestseller, remaining continuously in print for over six decades and selling over one million copies by the time of Daly's death in 2006. It received a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1969. Seventeenth Summer is now considered a classic. It has been credited with beginning the modern period of young adult literature, although at the time of its publication, young adult fiction was not recognized as a category (and would not be so recognized until the 1960s), and Seventeenth Summer was originally published as a novel for adults. A survey taken in the 1940s ranked the book as the third most popular with teenage readers, behind Gone with the Wind and Jane Eyre. Journalism career, marriage, and travel Despite the success of Seventeenth Summer, Daly did not write another novel for 44 years, choosing instead to pursue a journalism career. Daly explained in later interviews that she did not know Seventeenth Summer would be so successful and she needed a secure job in order to help support her mother and sisters, her father having died in 1944. She had already gained journalism experience while in college, including writing an advice column for teenagers that appeared in the Chicago Tribune and was syndicated to other newspapers. Her advice columns were later collected in a book entitled Smarter and Smoother: A Handbook on How to Be That Way (1944). After graduating from Rosary College, she joined the Tribune as a police beat reporter, as well as continuing her advice column. She left in 1945 to become an associate editor for Ladies' Home Journal magazine. Daly wrote a series of articles on teenagers for Ladies' Home Journal that were later gathered in the book Profile of Youth (1951). In 1952, she won a Freedoms Foundation Award for \\"humanity in journalism\\" for her article \\"City Girl\\", which profiled an African-American girl living in Chicago. Daly met William \\"Bill\\" McGivern at a book signing event for Seventeenth Summer in 1942, and corresponded with him during World War II. They married in 1946 and initially lived in Philadelphia. For the first ten years of their marriage, Daly was the primary breadwinner while McGivern, who later became a successful author and screenwriter, built his career. In 1950, the couple decided to become freelance writers, move to Europe with their young daughter, and travel around the world, and Daly resigned her editor position with Ladies' Home Journal. As a freelancer, Daly sent articles back to the US for publication, including interviews with Eleanor Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. Daly (as Maureen McGivern) and her husband later co-wrote Mention My Name in Mombasa; the Unscheduled Adventures of an American Family Abroad (1958), a memoir of their travels during this time to France, Spain, Gibraltar, Iceland, Belgium, Morocco, Nigeria, and Ireland. By the early 1960s, the McGiverns had returned to the United States, settling first in Pennsylvania and later in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, where Bill McGivern worked as a television and film writer. Daly served as an editorial consultant for The Saturday Evening Post from 1960 to 1969. In 1961, a collection of her short stories, Sixteen and Other Stories, was published. Between 1959 and the late 1960s, she wrote a number of story books for young children. In the early 1970s, the family moved to Palm Desert, California. Later novels and career Daly said that over the years, she had turned down many requests to write a new novel or a sequel to Seventeenth Summer, and that her failure to write a follow-up had led some teachers and librarians to think she was dead. However, Daly was motivated to write two more novels after her husband Bill McGivern and their adult daughter Megan both died of cancer in the early 1980s, within one year of each other. To cope with the loss, Daly wrote the young adult novel Acts of Love (1986), basing the protagonist, Retta Caldwell, on her daughter Megan and the plot on events that had happened to Megan as a teenager. She published a sequel, First a Dream, in 1990. Starting in 1988 and continuing into the 1990s, Daly was a long-term columnist for The Desert Sun newspaper in Palm Springs, California, writing food and restaurant reviews. Personal life and death Daly's sisters, as well as herself, all became known for their work in journalism, fashion, and advertising. Maggie became a model, journalist, and radio and television presenter, and Kay was an advertising executive and later a vice president at Revlon. When Daly left the Chicago Tribune in 1945 to join Ladies' Home Journal, her sister Sheila John, who was then a teenager, took over Daly's syndicated advice column for teenagers and continued to write the column into the 1960s, also penning several books of advice for teenagers. Time magazine called the four sisters \\"the celebrated Daly sisters,\\" and Life magazine published two articles on the sisters as a group and their respective careers. Daly said that she based the character of Seventeenth Summer's narrator and protagonist, Angie Morrow, on herself, and the characters of the other three Morrow sisters on her own sisters. Daly married mystery and crime thriller writer William P. \\"Bill\\" McGivern in 1946; he died of cancer in 1982. The couple had two children, Megan McGivern Shaw (1948‚Äì1983) and Patrick McGivern (1952‚Äì2012). Daly died at age 85 on September 25, 2006 in Palm Desert, California, of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\\"Daly, Maureen 1921‚Äì2006\\". Contemporary Authors. Gale. 2007.

It is located just south of the Sacramento River in the eastern portion of the county. Bryte's ZIP Code is 95605 and is in area codes 916 and 279. It lies at an elevation of 23 feet (7 m). Bryte was named after Mike Bryte, an early dairy farmer on whose land the town arose. Bryte came to California in 1849 to try his hand at gold mining. Although he did not make a fortune in gold, he bought a dairy farm in 1853 which was very successful. When the California Steam Navigation Company came to Washington, Bryte used the steamships to carry his dairy products to regional markets. Profits from this allowed Bryte to expand his holdings. By 1879, he owned 1,500 acres of land, raised 150 cows and 100 young stock, and farmed 2,500 acres in Sacramento County. Mike Bryte's status in the community was marked by his election to the Yolo County Board of Supervisors and later as sheriff. During the 20th century, Mike Bryte's property was subdivided and became known as the community of Bryte. A post office opened in Bryte in 1915.

Domestic long-distance service provides about 50% of the company's revenue; and international long-distance calls provide about 25%. Rostelecom interconnects all local public operators‚Äô networks into a single national network for long- distance service. In other words, if one makes a long-distance call or originates Internet contact to or from Russia, it is likely that Rostelecom is providing part of the service. The company's stock trades primarily on the Moscow Exchange. History Prior to 1990, responsibility for the provision of telecommunications services lie at the Ministry of Communications of the USSR. On June 26, 1990, the Ministry of Communications of the USSR established a state-owned joint-stock company Sovtelekom, which was given the rights to operate the telecommunications network of the USSR. On December 30, 1992, by order of the State Property Committee of Russia, a state-owned enterprise Rostelecom, which consisted of 20 state long-distance and international calls, as well as communication equipment Intertelekom was organized. Throughout the '90s, the company which was part of Svyazinvest, was the sole long-distance operator in Russia. Alongside it, local companies operated in the different regions of Russia under the umbrella of Svyazinvest while Rostelecom connected between their networks. In 2001, these companies were merged to form a number of regional incumbent telecommunications operators: CentreTelecom, SibirTelecom, Dalsvyaz, Uralsvyazinform, VolgaTelecom, North-West Telecom, Southern Telecommunications Company and Dagsvyazinform. On 2011, Svyazinvest was liquidated with the regional subsidiaries merged into Rostelecom. On October 18, 2006 \\"Rostelecom\\" received a certificate of quality of IP-MPLS network and became the ISP backbone. In December 2006, Rostelecom and the telecommunications company KDDI in Japan under the \\"Transit Europe - Asia\\" signed an agreement to build a line of Nakhodka - Naoetsu with total bandwidth of 640 Gbit/s instead of the previous 560 Mbit/s.–†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è-–Ø–ø–æ–Ω–∏—è: —Å–∫–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—å —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ –≤—ã—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ç –≤ 1000 —Ä–∞–∑ // CNews.ru, 13.12.2006 Ownership Owners of Rostelecom as of September 2018: * Federal Agency for State Property Management (45.04%) * OAO MobiTel (12.01%) * Vnesheconombank (3.96%) Operations Rostelecom has the largest domestic backbone network (approximately 500 thousand km) and last mile connections to approximately 35 million households in Russia. The Company holds licences to provide a wide range of telecommunications services (telephony, data, TV and value-added solutions) to residential, corporate and governmental subscribers and third party operators across all regions of the Russian Federation. The company offers \\"Karta Svyazi\\" a user-friendly prepaid long-distance telephone card service designed to provide telephony and access to the internet for people on the go. Land network The company's network is based on extant Russian fiber-optic cable lines - FOCL. By cable the network is connected to countries in Europe and East Asia. Fiber-optic cable lines crosses Russian Federation on directions ¬´Moscow ‚Äî Novorossiysk¬ª, ¬´Moscow ‚Äî Khabarovsk¬ª and ¬´Moscow ‚Äî Saint Petersburg¬ª. IP transit has been allocated to a separate company, RTComm, using Rostelecom's STM-16 FOCL resources, but Rostelecom is building its own STM-64 (9,9533 Gbit/s) network, which as of August 2006, covered Rostov-on-Don, Krasnodar, Volgograd, Stavropol, and planned to cover the whole of Russia by the end of 2006. Rostelecom had 29.2 million local fixed-line voice subscribers, 12.4 million mobile voice subscribers, 7.4 million fixed-line broadband subscribers and 5.5 million pay-TV subscribers at the end of the first quarter of 2010. Satellite network Using the services of the Russian Orbital Group, Rostelecom has built its satellite system for its Eastern region, comprising 11 land stations in Siberia and the Russian Far East. Satellite service for the Western region is being built at this time. Cellular network Throughout the 90s Rostelecom created subsidiaries that operated cellular networks in different regions of the country, including NSS, Baikalvestkom, Yeniseikom, SkyLink, Volgograd GSM and Akos which provided mobile services on the territory of 59 regions of Russia, serving more than 13.5 million subscribers. During the 2010s, Rostelecom and its subsidiaries built mobile networks of the third generation in 27 regions of Russia. Total planned to install more than 8 thousand base stations. Suppliers of equipment and solutions for the 3G+ network are Ericsson and Huawei. In April 2013 the company announced the launch of 3G+ networks in the Sverdlovsk, Kurgan and Chelyabinsk regions, in the south of the Tyumen Oblast and in the Yamalo- Nenets Autonomous Area. This launch followed the introduction of 3G+ services in Perm Krai. Rostelecom's 3G+ network was installed using HSPA+ technology, providing data transfer speeds of up to 21MB/s, with the possibility of upgrading the network to reach speeds of up to 42MB/s if demand requires. The 3G+ network is LTE-ready, so that only minor modifications will be required before the company can roll out its 4G (LTE) network in the future. In June 2013 Rostelecom launched its first part of its LTE network in Sochi for the 2014 Winter Olympics. Besides, the company launched LTE networks in 8 other regions besides Karsnodar Krai by the end of 2013, including Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, Republic of Khakassia, Republic of North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania, Sakhalin Oblast, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Nenets Autonomous Okrug and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. In December 2013, Rostelecom board approved a plan to merge its mobile business into Tele2 Russia, former division of Nordic telecoms group Tele2 which sold it in April 2013 to VTB Bank due to the lack of 3G and 4G data licences, limiting its future growth prospects. Rostelecom would get a 45% voting stake in the new company, T2 RTK Holding, in exchange for contributing its standalone mobile subsidiaries and assets, including SkyLink. Tele2 Russia, owned by state-controlled bank VTB and Russian businessmen Yuri Kovalchuk and Alexei Mordashov, will have 55%. Rostelecom and Tele2 Russia together have around 38 million mobile subscribers, or a combined market share of 16%. During the second stage, Rostelecom spun-off its integrated mobile businesses into its new wholly owned subsidiary, RT-Mobile (), which will be expected to have Rostelecom's mobile licences, including the LTE licences, re-issued to it. Analysts said the deal makes sense as \\"Rostelecom has been less efficient in rolling out mobile networks. By relying on the Tele2 team in mobile expansion Rostelecom removes risks, while remaining open to an upside\\". In February 2014 Rostelecom and Tele2 signed a framework agreement on the integration of mobile assets to the authorized capital of the joint venture \\"T2 Rus Holding\\". At the first stage of integration, Rostelecom passed seven cellular subsidiaries it owns: \\"Sky Link\\", \\"Nizhny Novgorod Cellular Communications\\", \\"Baikalwestcom\\", \\" Volgograd GSM\\" Yenisei Telecom\\" and ICCO. Controversy In April 2017, Rostelecom (AS12389) originated 50 prefixes for numerous other autonomous systems (AS). This caused Internet traffic normally destined for these organizations to instead be routed to Rostelecom. The hijacked prefixes belonged to financial institutions (most notably MasterCard and Visa), other telecom companies, and a variety of other organizations. What makes the list of affected networks 'curious' is the high number of financial institutions such as: MasterCard, Visa, Fortis, Alfa-Bank, and more. The other notable characteristic of this event is that the advertisement included several more prefixes that were more specifically defined than the prefixes normally announced, which makes it less likely that these were unintentionally leaked.

While recording the album, she married her producer Frazier Mohawk (born Barry Friedman, 1941) and from then on was known as Essra Mohawk. \\"Essra\\" (S-ra) is an abbreviated form of Sandra. She was scheduled to perform at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, but her manager missed a turn, resulting in them barely arriving before the end of the last act on Friday evening, too late to perform. Members of Generation X may recognize her distinctive voice from the Saturday morning TV series Schoolhouse Rock!, as she lent her voice to \\"Interjections!\\", \\"Mother Necessity\\" and \\"Sufferin' Till Suffrage\\" in the mid-1970s. In addition, Mohawk sang the theme song to \\"Teeny Little Super Guy\\", a regular segment on Sesame Street during the 1980s. Her third, eponymous, album came out on Asylum Records in 1974. It was panned by Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981): \\"Here is a vocalist who should throw away all her Leon Russell records. When she calls herself a 'full-fledged woman,' it sounds like 'pool player's' woman, which given her persona makes more sense.\\" The next album, Essra, was released on yet another label, Private Stock, in 1976. During that period, she also worked as a session and background singer, for John Mellencamp, Carole King and later she performed with the Jerry Garcia Band, and recorded and arranged background vocals for Kool & the Gang. In 1982 after recording another album in L.A., she worked with McFadden and Whitehead in Philadelphia, penning \\"Not With Me\\" for their Capitol album, Movin' On. She released another solo album, E-Turn, before Cyndi Lauper had a hit with her song \\"Change of Heart\\" in 1986. In 2011 she provided the lead vocal for an animated short film produced by TDA Animation, about the struggle for gay rights; called; \\"Sufferin' Till You're Straight\\". The spot featured former Supremes, Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene on background vocals. She has written songs for other artists including co- writing a song entitled \\"Infinite Eyes\\" with blues artist Keb Mo as well as recording and performing in concert. She has released six more albums since moving to Nashville in 1993. Essra's songs have been aired on the TV series Joan of Arcadia and the soap opera All My Children. Rhino released a special limited edition of her second and third albums, Primordial Lovers MM in 2000. Mohawk has been a longtime advocate of peace and environmental protection. She is a member of the board of Musicians and Artists for Peace and is their Nashville coordinator.

The siege and fighting left the capital devastated. In 2003, the United Nations called Grozny the most destroyed city on Earth.Scars remain amid Chechen revival, BBC News, March 3, 2007 Between 5,000 and 8,000 civlians were killed during the siege, making it the bloodiest episode of the Second Chechen War. Prelude On October 15, 1999, after mounting an intense tank and artillery barrage against Chechen separatists, Russian forces took control of a strategic ridge within artillery range of Grozny. They then made several abortive attempts to seize positions on the outskirts of the city. On December 4, the commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, General Viktor Kazantsev, claimed that Grozny was fully blockaded by Russian troops. General Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the army's general staff, even predicted the rebels would abandon the Chechen capital on their own, urged to withdraw by civilians fearing widespread destruction. Supported by a powerful air force, the Russian force vastly outnumbered and out-gunned the Chechen irregulars, who numbered around 3,000 to 6,000 fighters, and was considerably larger and much better prepared than the force sent to take the Chechen capital in the First Chechen War. In addition, the tactics of both sides in this second campaign were drastically different. Tactics The Russian strategy in 1999 was to hold back tanks and armored personnel carriers and subject the entrenched Chechens to an intensive heavy artillery barrage and aerial bombardment before engaging them with relatively small groups of infantry, many with prior training in urban warfare. The Russian forces relied heavily on rocket artillery such as BM-21 Grad,http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-11-27/news/9911270017_1_russian- forces-grozny-chechen-capital BM-27 Uragan, BM-30 Smerch, ballistic missiles (SCUD, OTR-21 Tochka), cluster bombs and fuel air explosives. (The TOS-1, a multiple rocket launcher with thermobaric weapon warheads, played a particularly prominent role in the assault). These weapons wore down the Chechens, both physically and psychologically, and air strikes were also used to attack fighters hiding in basements; such attacks were designed for maximum psychological pressure. They would also demonstrate the hopelessness of further resistance against a foe that could strike with impunity and that was invulnerable to countermeasures. In November, the Kremlin appointed Beslan Gantamirov, former mayor of Grozny, as head of the pro-Moscow Chechen State Council. Gantamirov had just been pardoned by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and released from a 6-year prison sentence which he had been serving for embezzling federal funds which had been earmarked for the rebuilding of Chechnya in 1995 and 1996. He was chosen to lead a pro-Russian Chechen militia force in the upcoming battle. Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo however refused to supply the militia with heavy weapons, limiting their combat arsenal to \\"obsolete AK-47s\\" and accused Gantamirov of accepting anyone who would volunteer, including rebel fighters.Grozny's Maverick Mayor Resigns, Institute for War and Peace Reporting, May 21, 2001 The militia, often used to spearhead the federal forces, suffered heavy casualties, losing more than 700 men in the battle. The Russians met fierce resistance from Chechen rebel fighters intimately familiar with their capital city. The defenders had chosen to withstand the heavy Russian bombardment for the chance to come to grips with their enemy in an environment of their choosing, using interconnected firing positions and maneuver warfare. In stark contrast to the ad-hoc defense of 1994, the separatists prepared well for the Russian assault. Grozny was transformed into a fortress city under the leadership of field commander Aslambek Ismailov. The Chechens dug hundreds of trenches and antitank ditches, built bunkers behind apartment buildings, laid land mines throughout the city, placed sniper nests on high-rise buildings and prepared escape routes. In some instances whole buildings were booby-trapped; the ground floor windows and doors were usually boarded-up or mined, making it impossible for the Russians to simply walk into a building. Relying on their high mobility (they usually did not use body armor because of lack of equipment), the Chechens would use the trenches to move between houses and sniper positions, engaging the Russians as they focused on the tops of buildings or on windows. Well- organized small groups of no more than 15 fighters moved freely about Grozny using the city's sewer network, even sneaking behind Russian lines and attacking unsuspecting soldiers from the rear. Siege The Russian ground troops advanced slowly, and Grozny was surrounded by late November 1999. More than two additional weeks of shelling and bombing were required before Russian troops were able to claim a foothold within any part of the heavily fortified city. Russian ground forces met stiff resistance from rebel fighters as they moved forward, using a slow, neighborhood-by-neighborhood advance with the fighting focused on a strategic hill overlooking the city. Both sides accused each other of launching chemical attacks.Welcome to Chechnya. Welcome to hell, The Guardian, December 10, 1999 Claims of chemical attacks may have originated from the observation of unburnt remnants of gaseous explosive from TOS-1 thermobaric missiles or the chemicals may have escaped from destroyed industrial plants. The rumours of gas attacks and the divisions among Chechens (the Islamic extremists were blamed for provoking the war), contributed to the abandoning of Grozny by many rebel fighters. Splits with extremists hit morale in Grozny, The Independent, December 15, 1999 In early December, Russia seized the town of Urus-Martan, the separatist stronghold near Grozny, after it had been battered with heavy air and artillery bombardments for several weeks.Russia seizes key stronghold near; Grozny Officials play down leaflet warning, Chicago Sun-Times, December 9, 1999 The majority of the city's civilian population fled following the missile attacks early in the war, leaving the streets mostly deserted. However, as many as 40,000 civilians, often the elderly, poor, and infirm, remained trapped in basements during the siege, suffering from the bombing, cold, and hunger. Some of them were killed while trying to flee. On December 3, about 40 people died when a refugee convoy attempting to leave the besieged areas was fired on.'Russians fired on refugees', BBC News, December 4, 1999 Around 250 to 300 people who were killed while trying to escape in October 1999, between the villages of Goryachevodsk and Petropavlovskaya, were buried in a mass grave.Watchdog alleges mass grave in Russia's Chechnya, Reuters, Jul 1, 2008The \\"vanished\\" grave, Prague Watchdog, July 21, 2008 The Russian forces besieging Grozny planned to attack the city with a heavy air and artillery bombardment, intending to level the city to the extent where it was impossible for the rebels to defend it. On December 5, Russian planes, which had been dropping bombs on Grozny, switched to leaflets with a warning from the general staff. The Russians set a deadline, urging residents of Grozny to leave \\"by any means possible by December 11, 1999: The Russian commanders prepared a \\"safe corridor\\" for those wishing to escape from Grozny, but reports from the war zone suggested few people were using it when it opened on December 11. Desperate refugees who got away were telling stories of bombing, shelling and brutality.Refugees fear Grozny assault, BBC News, December 10, 1999 Russia put the number of people remaining in Grozny at 15,000, while a group of Chechen exiles in Geneva confirmed other reports estimating the civilian population at 50,000. Russia eventually withdrew the ultimatum in the face of international outrage from the United States and the European Union. British foreign secretary Robin Cook \\"wholeheartedly condemned\\" the Russian move: \\"We condemn vigorously what Milosevic did in Kosovo and we condemn vigorously what Russia is doing in Chechnya\\".UK condemns Chechnya ultimatum, BBC News, December 7, 1999 But the heavy bombardment of the city continued. According to Russia's ministry for emergency situations, civilians remaining in Grozny had been estimated at anywhere from 8,000 to 35,000. The early fighting was concentrated in the eastern outskirts of Grozny, with reconnaissance teams entering the city to identify rebel positions. The Russian tactic appeared to be to draw fire from the rebels, then pull back and pound the Chechen positions with artillery and rocket fire. By December 13 Russian troops had regained control of Chechnya's main airport. Located in the suburb of Khankala, it was the main Russian military base during the first war and it was one of the first targets to be hit by warplanes at the start of Russia's involvement in the second. The next day, more than 100 Russian troops were reported killed when an armored column was ambushed in Minutka Square;Russians ambushed in Grozny, BBC News, December 16, 1999 reports by the Reuters and Associated Press correspondents were vehemently denied by the Russian government.Russian Tanks Pounding Grozny from 3 Directions, The New York Times, December 18, 1999 On January 2, Chechen fighters attacked and destroyed a Russian armoured column which had entered the village of Duba-Yurt the day before. The following day, Gen. Valentin Astaviyev said on state television that Russian forces had suffered only three dead in the previous 24 hours. Yet the commander of an Interior Ministry unit in Grozny told Agence France-Presse that 50 men had been killed in the previous 48 hours. On January 4, Chechen fighters in Grozny launched a series of counter attacks and broke through Russian lines in at least two places, temporarily seizing the village of Alkhan-Kala.Russian army battered in Grozny, BBC News, January 6, 2000 Russian public support for the war, which was previously overwhelming, appeared to fade as casualties mounted and the government came in for increasing criticism in the tightly controlled Russian media for understating casualty figures.Russia media criticize Chechen campaign, BBC News, January 8, 2000 However, Russia's heavy bombardments had finally begun to take their toll: using multiple rocket launchers and massed tank and artillery fire, the Russians flattened large parts of Grozny in preparation for an all-out assault. On January 10, Chechen forces launched a major counteroffensive in support of the garrison in Grozny,The Chechens' Surprise, Institute for War and Peace Reporting, 14-Jan-00 briefly recapturing the major towns of Shali, Argun and Gudermes, and opening a new supply corridor to the besieged capital. In a series of coordinated attacks, the Chechens also ambushed a supply column on the Argun-Gudermes road near the village of Dzhalka, killing at least 26 servicemen in the heaviest one-day official death toll since the war began in September. The commander for the North Caucasus, Gen. Kazantsev, blamed the heavy losses on mistakes by \\"soft- hearted\\" officials who had allowed the rebels to counter-attack and declared that from now on only boys under the age of 10, old men over the age of 60, and girls and women would be considered refugees.Chechens 'break Grozny siege', BBC News, January 11, 2000 On January 15, the Russians said 58 Chechens were killed as they attempted to flee Grozny.Russia steps up attacks, reports fresh gains in Chechnya , CNN, January 15, 2001 By mid-January, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers had begun an advance on central Grozny from three directions. During this fighting, several suburbs and key buildings adjoining the city center changed hands several times. In a number of incidents, small bands of rebel fighters cut off exposed Russian units from the main forces. On January 19, in a major setback for the Russian forces, Chechen snipers killed one of the Russian commanders, Gen. Mikhail Malofeyev. Russian troops were unable to recover his body until five days later. Two days later, one Russian unit lost 20 men killed in north-west Grozny after the rebels made their way through sewage tunnels and attacked them from the rear.Chechens use tunnels, snipers to stop Russians in Grozny , CNN, January 21, 2000 On January 26, the Russian government admitted that 1,173 servicemen had been killed in Chechnya since the war began in October.Russia admits heavy casualties, BBC News, January 26, 2000 This figure was more than twice the 544 dead reported 19 days earlier, on January 6, with just 300 dead reported on January 4, indicating heavy losses in the Grozny battles and elsewhere during this month (later, Russia claimed 368 servicemen were killed in the city). Breakout With their supply routes interdicted by an increasingly effective Russian blockade, ammunition running low and their losses mounting, the Chechen rebel leadership decided that resistance was futile. At a meeting in a bunker in central Grozny the rebel commanders decided on a desperate gamble to break through the three layers of Russian forces and into the mountains. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov had been evacuated earlier to a secret headquarters somewhere in the south of Chechnya. About 1,000‚Äì1,500 fighters under field commander Ruslan Gelayev withdrew without orders, leaving other rebel forces exposed. The main Chechen forces began to escape on the last day of January and first day of February during a violent winter storm, after an attempt to bribe their way out. A reconnaissance party they sent ahead failed to return, but the commanders decided to leave anyway.Minefield massacre decimates Chechens, Associated Press, February 5, 2000 Some 4,000Fleeing Chechen rebels pledge to recapture Grozny, The Independent, Feb 4, 2000 rebel fighters and some civilians,Colin McMahon, GROZNY RETREAT: A WALK THROUGH BLOOD AND FLESH. , Chicago Tribune, February 13, 2000 moving in a southwesterly direction, were met with heavy artillery fire. The column of some 2,000 fighters, several hundred non-combatants and 50 Russian prisoners of war, hit a minefield between the city and the village of Alkhan-Kala. The Russian forces ambushed them as they were crossing a bridge over the Sunzha River. The Russian artillery barrage homed in on their position and the situation became desperate. The Chechens pushed on through the minefield, being unaware of it and lacking engineers. Scores of rebel fighters were killed by the combination of artillery fire and the crossing of the minefield, including several top Chechen commanders: Khunkar-Pasha Israpilov, the city's mayor Lecha Dudayev and Aslambek Ismailov, the mastermind behind the defense of Grozny. The rebels said they lost about 400 fighters in the minefield at Alkhan-Kala,Russia may withdraw some troops from Chechnya , CNN, February 4, 2000 including 170 killed.

In June 2000, Russian police and special forces units began a major counter insurgency operation against the rebel forces in Grozny, but the bombings and clashes in the city continued as the guerrillas hid among the partially returned civilian population. According to the city's mayor Bislan Gantamirov, the guerrillas were being helped by the Chechen police and the Russians were unlawfully killing up to 15 Chechens a day in Grozny.

There was also a series of bomb attacks against local government buildings (including suicide bombings). In 2002, Grozny was struck by a truck bomb, which destroyed the seat of the pro-Moscow Chechen government, killing at least 83. Military installations and police stations were also attacked and there were many daylight sniper shootings and other incidents, all aiming to kill or capture Russian soldiers venturing into the streets alone or in small groups.

Mei Xiang has given birth to seven cubs, all at the National Zoo and fathered by Tian Tian. Three of her cubs have survived to adulthood. Mei Xiang's most recent cub was born on August 21, 2020.  Life  Mei Xiang was born on July 22, 1998, at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province; she weighs about 230 pounds. Her mother was Xue Xue and her father was Lin Nan; both parents were wild pandas. She and Tian Tian, a male, are the National Zoo's second pair of giant pandas. Giant pandas are thought to be solitary creatures, except for mating season and mothers with young cubs. In keeping with the habits of wild pandas, Mei is generally alone, although Mei and Tian are occasionally together outside of breeding season. Tian and Mei are trained to participate in a full medical examination, including a blood draw, without anesthesia. Offspring Mei Xiang playing with son, 7 month old Tai Shan, Feb. 14, 2006, at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington Mei Xiang at the National Zoo in Washington D.C., February 2010 Mei Xiang has given birth to seven cubs. Tai Shan, a male, was born July 9, 2005. He was the first panda cub to be born at the zoo and live for more than a few days. He lived at the zoo until February 4, 2010, when he moved to China, as per an agreement between the United States and China. Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated twice in April 2012 with Tian Tian's sperm. Zoo officials estimated her chances of pregnancy at 10% after she had previously had five false pregnancies, in which she acted pregnant but was not. Another cub was born on the night of September 16, 2012, and was a surprise to zookeepers. As of September 17, zoo officials did not know the sex of the cub. The cub, whom officials believed to have been a female, was found deceased on September 23, 2012 after Mei Xiang expressed distressed, honking-like sounds. Initial findings from the necropsy ruled out the possibility that it could have been crushed by Mei Xiang. However, it showed fluid in the giant panda cub's abdomen (which is usually abnormal), and some discoloration of some of the liver tissue. The liver was also hard in places. The cub's death was determined to be the result of insufficient oxygen to the liver. This was because the lungs were not fully developed, and consequently the lungs were unable to pick up oxygen for the red blood cells to deliver to the liver. On March 30, 2013, veterinarians at the National Zoo artificially inseminated Mei Xiang after natural breeding failed to occur. At approximately 5:30 p.m. local time on August 23, 2013, it was announced that Mei Xiang had given birth to her third cub. Mei Xiang gave birth again the following night, Saturday, August 24, 2013 to a stillborn cub, a female. The surviving cub was later revealed to also be female. She was later named Bao Bao (\\"treasure\\", colloquially meaning \\"baby\\") when she turned 100 days old. In August 2015, veterinarians found what was believed to be a giant panda fetus on an obstetric ultrasound. She had been displaying behaviors consistent with a pregnancy or pseudopregnancy: spending more time in her den, sleeping more, cradling objects, and licking her body. She went on to give birth to two live male giant panda cubs, both fathered by Tian Tian. She gave birth to the first live cub at 5:35pm on August 22, 2015, and delivered the second, larger cub later that night at 10:07 PM On August 26, 2015, the National Zoo announced that the smaller of the two cubs had died. The surviving cub, who (like Bao Bao) was a high-profile birth for the zoo. On September 25, 2015, the cub was officially named Bei Bei, which means \\"precious, treasure.\\" The name was chosen by First Ladies Michelle Obama of the United States and Peng Liyuang of China. In March 2020 shortly after the National Zoo closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated using only frozen sperm to avoid too much close contact. In August 2020, the National Zoo announced that Mei Xiang was pregnant. A few days after announcing that they had detected fetal tissue, the zoo tweeted a short video of an ultrasound showing a panda fetus. On August 21, Mei Xiang gave birth to a live male cub, making her the oldest panda in the United States to give birth, at 22 years old. This meant the first success for this type of procedure.

Swaraj Bhavan (formerly Anand Bhavan, meaning Abode of Bliss) is a large mansion located in Prayagraj, India, best known for once being owned by the Indian political leader Motilal Nehru and being home to the Nehru family until 1930. It is managed by the 'Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund', Delhi and functions as a museum open to the public. It has 42 rooms and a number of memorabilia including a charkha used by Mahatma Gandhi, photographs of the Indian freedom movement, personal belongings of the Nehru family and an underground room that is said to have been used occasionally for meetings. History Mahmud Manzil The building at 1 Church road that is today called Swaraj Bhavan was originally called Mahmud Manzil. It was built in 1871 for Syed Ahmad Khan, the 19th century Indian Muslim leader and educationist, at the behest of the then Lieutenant Governor of the NWP (North West provinces) William Muir. The latter often took the advice of Syed Ahmad Khan in administrative matters which necessitated Khan's presence in Allahabad. However, since Khan lived in Aligarh, he did not have a place to stay in Allahabad for prolonged visits. Muir suggested that Khan maintain a house in Allahabad too, where he could stay during such official visits. A site consisting of 20 acres of land owned by a person called Shaikh Fayyaz Ali was selected for this purpose. It was located just 10 minutes drive from the Government House and Ali had received the land here as compensation for the losses incurred by him during the 1857 mutiny. Work to build a large house here commenced around 1868 and the house was completed in 1871. It was originally called \\"Mahmud Manzil\\" after Syed Ahmad Khan's son's name. It was later occupied by Syed Mahmud, who lived here as a tenant when he became the Justice of the Allahabad High Court. Fayyaz Ali continued to live on the estate till his death in 1873 in a bungalow called Bungalow Fatehpur Bishwa that he had made here. However, the connection between Sir Muir, Syed Ahmad Khan and Mahmud Manzil are unverified as different sources yield different results. In 1873, when Fayyaz Ali died, the property was administered by the Allahabad court of wards, as his children were minors. Syed Khan continued to live here as a tenant. Subsequently the house changed hands and was sold in 1888. In a commemorative essay by Indira Gandhi, the latter recollects that the house was sold to Rai Bahadur Permanand Pathak, the Judge of Shahjahanpur during this period. However, the house gradually fell into a state of disrepair as it lay unoccupied for long periods of time. In 1900, the house and the estate attached to it were bought for Rs. 19,000 and named Anand Bhavan, \\"abode of happiness\\", by Pandit Motilal Nehru, then a prominent lawyer.Nanda, B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962) p.91 Historian David Lelyveld has given a different sequence of events where the property was given an estate in 1861 in compensation for losses sustained during the revolt of 1857. This property was purchased by Syed Mahmud, a Justice of the Allahabad High Court, for Rs 9,000 in 1888. Anand Bhavan SwarajBhawan, previously called Anand Bhavan Motilal Nehru named the house Anand Bhavan (meaning peaceful abode) and started to renovate the palatial residence. The house was in complete disrepair, but the estate was huge. Extensive renovation work was carried out over the next decade. Motilal used his frequent visits to Europe to buy the choicest furniture and china. He turned the mansion into a veritable palace, 'an elaborate replica of an English country estate ‚Ä¶ bifurcated between East and West', with a retinue of almost a hundred people in the house. Motilal called the house Anand Bhavan (lit. Abode of happiness). Ironically, at the house-warming party in 1871, Sir William Muir hoped that this large palatial home in Civil Lines of Allahabad would become the cement holding together the British Empire in India. Paradoxically, the house was bought by Motilal Nehru in 1900, and went on to become a cradle to the Indian Freedom Struggle which was to destroy British rule in India. Swaraj Bhavan Memorial at the newer Anand Bhavan, Allahabad Motilal Nehru was a prominent member of the Indian National Congress Party. Due to this, a number of noted leaders and party activists would visit the \\"Nehru House\\". Following the rise of Motilal's son, Jawaharlal Nehru, the mansion virtually became the center of the Indian independence movement. It was informally the headquarters of the All India Congress Committee in the 1920s before it was donated by Motilal Nehru to the Indian National Congress in 1930, to serve as the party's official headquarters in the region.Nehru & Sahgal, Before Freedom, 1909-1947: Nehru's Letters to His Sister (2004), Part 3. p.86-188 The Nehrus built another house next to the old one and named that Anand Bhavan; the old house was renamed Swaraj Bhavan (lit. Abode of freedom).B. R. The Nehrus Motilal and Jawaharlal (1962) p.328 Museum Indira Gandhi, India's then Prime Minister, donated Anand Bhavan to the nation in 1970 and turned it into a museum housing the books and memorabilia of her father and grandfather. Today it is one of the country's best-run museums. Its pillared verandahs and high- ceilinged rooms have witnessed many trysts with destiny; some are known and documented by historians of modern India, others known only to its inmates who are no more. Now, the Swaraj Bhavan premise conducts classes to teach arts and crafts to children. A light and sound programme is also organized here. There are four shows every day.

History Knights Landing was founded in 1843, by Dr. William Knight, a practicing physician from Baltimore, Maryland. William Knight built on a mound that marked the ancient meeting place of Native Americans inhabiting the regions about Cache Creek and the Sacramento River. The site early demonstrated its importance as a steamboat landing and point of communication between the people east and west of the big central river. When the town was laid out in 1849 they called it Baltimore, but an agreement over the sale of the new town lots could not be amicably arranged and the title Baltimore was lost. Knight established a ferry there, which afterwards passed to the ownership of J. W. Snowball. In those days the ferry tolls were for a man and horse, $1; for a team and wagon, $5. In 1850 S. R. Smith kept a hotel in the settlement and in 1853 Charles F. Reed surveyed and laid out a townsite and it was given officially the name of Knight's Landing. That year J. W. Snowball and J. J. Perkins opened a large general merchandise store on the Native American mound. On 1 January Capt. J. H. Updegraff opened his hotel under festive auspices, with a grand New Year's party, with tickets $10, a steamer being run from Sacramento for the accommodation of guests. The establishment was called the \\"Yolo House.\\" In 1860 D. N. Hershey and George Glascock erected a brick hotel, which took the place of the Yolo House, that inn being retired to the status of a private residence. On March 25, 1890, the Knight's Landing branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad was completed and ready for business, and later the completion of the bridge across the river added immensely to the prosperity of the town. The famous and now merged Southern Pacific Railroad Company once had a line from Davis, CA, via Woodland, CA through Knights Landing, and the line continued to Marysville, CA, via a junction in Yuba City, CA. This 1879 map shows the railroad from Woodland almost to East Grafton (which contains Knights Landing): http://www.historicmapworks.com/Map/US/159571/West+Grafton+Township++East+Grafton+Township++Cacheville+Township/Yolo+County+1879/California/. The line now stops a few miles northeast of Woodland. Grafton Elementary was the only public school in the community. It closed June 23, 2009. The area is served by Woodland Joint Unified School District. In 2010, the Science and Technology Academy of Knights Landing opened on the former Grafton Elementary campus as a charter school. Knights Landing Cemetery (just south of town on County Road 102) is one of several purported final resting places of the stagecoach bandit Charles Bolles, a.k.a. Black Bart. If present, the grave is unmarked.

He was born in Brooklyn and appeared in vaudeville under the name of Jackie Hayes from the age of 4. Artistic career In 1939 Gari enrolled and studied at the Art Students League of New York under the auspices of such renowned instructors as Will Barnet and Ethel Schwabacher. Gari worked with oil on canvas, watercolor, charcoal, pastels, and pen and ink. His subjects were usually portraits, in Impressionist or Modernist style. He became a respected artist with numerous exhibitions in such galleries as the Bodley Gallery in NYC and the Raymond Burr and Acosta galleries in Beverly Hills. His paintings have been collected by such stars as Shelley Winters, Steve Allen, Debbie Reynolds, Eddie Fisher, Eddie Cantor and former President Ronald Reagan (who hung his Gari painting in the White House). His painting of singer Judy Garland was on display in the lobby of New York's Palace Theatre for many years and now hangs in the Theatre Collection of the Museum of the City of New York. Show business career Some of the highlights of Gari's show business career included dancing with Vera-Ellen in the Broadway production of 'A Connecticut Yankee' in 1944 and later as Merlin the magician in the same production. Other Broadway credits include 'Sadie Thompson' (with June Havoc) and Eddie Cantor's production of 'Nellie Bly'. During the 1950s he appeared on The Colgate Comedy Hour as well as the Four Star Revue. During the 1960s and 1970s his family commitments and his art work kept him away from performing; he returned in the 1980s and subsequently could be seen in such films as I.Q., The Associate, Scent of a Woman, She Devil and One Fine Day. He also had regular roles on television in the daytime soap operas Guiding Light (as Maurice the bartender) and Another World (as Alistair the butler from 1992‚Äì1995). He was also prominently featured on Candid Camera and The Last Mile on PBS. His final TV role was playing Amy Sedaris' father in a dozen episodes of the cult Comedy Central series Strangers with Candy.

It is around west of Bungay, Suffolk. History Hardwick Airfield was one of the early heavy bomber airfields which were constructed for the Royal Air Force (RAF) during 1941-42 in the East Anglian area. It was built by John Laing & Son Ltd., and required of surface drains, of drains, of roadways, of sewers and of water mains. A total of 4,750,000 bricks were used in construction of the camp. Like other heavy bomber fields originally planned for RAF needs and begun at the same time, this airfield had three T-2 hangars grouped together on the administrative and technical site, in this case on the eastern side of the airfield. The technical site was adjacent to the hangars and bordered the country road running from Hempnall to Alburgh. On the eastern side of this road lay the major part of the camp with domestic sites hidden amongst woodland. One site was located at Topcroft Street. All accommodation was of the temporary type, mostly Nissen huts. The bomb dump was situated off the north-west corner of the airfield in and adjacent to Spring Wood. United States Army Air Forces use When assigned to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), Hardwick was designated as Station 104. From 7 November 1943 through 12 June 1945, Hardwick served as headquarters for the 20th Combat Bombardment Wing of the 2nd Bomb Division. Originally, 30 hardstands were planned, sufficient for RAF requirements, but these were increased to fifty for the USAAF Eighth Air Force, thirty-nine being of the early 'frying-pan' type and the remainder loops. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Hardwick were: * 461st Sub-Depot * 18th Weather Squadron * 5th Station Complement Squadron * Headquarters (20th Combat Bomb Wing) Regular Army Station Units included: * 1094th Quartermaster Company * 1248th Military Police Company * 1675th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 885th Chemical Company (Air Operations) * 2031st Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon  310th Bombardment Group (Medium)  The airfield was opened in September 1942 and was first used by the 310th Bombardment Group (Medium), arriving from Greenville AAB South Carolina. Apparently the 428th Bombardment Squadron of the 310th Bombardment Group was diverted to RAF Bungay. A 12th Air Force film clip indicates that the 310th Bombardment Group was the first 12th Air Force group to leave the United States for Europe and initially arrived in Prestwick, Scotland. Flying the North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber, the 310th used Hardwick as a transshipment point on its way to Telergma, Algeria as a part of Twelfth Air Force. The last elements of the 310th departed for North Africa in November.  93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy)  93d Bomb Group Consolidated B-24D-1-CO Liberator Serial 41-23711.

A B-24D Liberator (serial number 42-72869) of the 93rd Bomb Group flies over the cloud layer. The VIII Bomber Command 93rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) arrived at Hardwick from RAF Alconbury in December 1942. The group was assigned to the 20th Combat Bombardment Wing and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-B\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 328th Bombardment Squadron (GO) * 329th Bombardment Squadron (RE) * 330th Bombardment Squadron (AG) * 409th Bombardment Squadron (YM) The 93rd flew the Consolidated B-24 Liberator as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The group entered combat on 9 October 1942 by attacking steel and engineering works at Lille. Until December 1942, the group operated primarily against submarine pens in the Bay of Biscay. A large detachment was sent to North Africa in December 1942, the group receiving a Distinguished Unit Citation for operations in that theatre, December 1942 - February 1943, when, with inadequate supplies and under the most difficult desert conditions, the detachment struck heavy blows at enemy shipping and communications. The detachment returned to England in February 1943 and until the end of June the group bombed engine repair works, harbours, power plants, and other targets in France, the Low Countries, and Germany. A detachment returned to the Mediterranean theatre during June and July 1943 to support the Allied invasion of Sicily and to participate in the famous low-level attack on enemy oil installations at Ploesti on 1 August. Having followed another element of the formation along the wrong course to Ploesti, the 93rd hit targets that had been assigned to other groups, but it carried out its bombing of the vital oil installations despite heavy losses inflicted by attacks from the fully alerted enemy and was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for the operation. Lt. Col. Addison E. Baker, group commander, and Major John L. Jerstad, a former member of the group who had volunteered for this mission, were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for action in the Ploesti raid. Refusing to make a forced landing in their damaged B-24, these men, as pilot and co-pilot of the lead plane, led the group to bomb the oil facilities before their plane crashed in the target area. After the detachment returned to England in August 1943, the group flew only two missions before the detachment was sent back to the Mediterranean to support the Fifth Army at Salerno during the invasion of Italy in September 1943. The detachment rejoined the group in October 1943, and until April 1945 the 93rd concentrated on bombardment of strategic targets such as marshalling yards, aircraft factories, oil refineries, chemical plants, and cities in Germany. In addition it bombed gun emplacements, choke points, and bridges near Cherbourg during the Normandy invasion in June 1944. It attacked troop concentrations in northern France during the Saint-L√¥ breakthrough in July 1944; transported food, gasoline, water, and other supplies to the Allies advancing across France, August - September 1944; dropped supplies to airborne troops in the Netherlands on 18 September 1944; struck enemy transportation and other targets during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 - January 1945; and flew two missions on 24 March 1945 during the airborne assault across the Rhine, dropping supplies to troops near Wesel and bombing a night-fighter base at Stormede. The 93rd Bomb Group ceased combat operations in April 1945, and returned to Sioux Falls AAF South Dakota during May/June. Legacy In preparation for the Invasion of Japan, the group was redesignated the 93rd Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) in July and converted to Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, being assigned to Prat AAF Kansas for training. However, with the end of the war in September, the group was transferred to Clovis AAF New Mexico and was assigned to Strategic Air Command. The 93d Bomb Wing was a front-line unit of SAC during the Cold War until its deactivation on 30 September 1995 with the closure of Castle Air Force Base. The unit exists today as the 116th Air Control Wing at Robins AFB, Georgia, being the first United States Air Force wing \\"blended\\" from active duty and Air National Guard airmen. The 93d was designated as such on 1 October 2002 following the blending of the active duty 93d Air Control Wing and the ANG 116th Bomb Wing. The wing flies the E-8 Joint STARS aircraft and remains assigned to Eighth Air Force under Air Combat Command. Postwar RAF use After the war, the field was turned over to the RAF on 25 June 1945. The station was immediately put into care and maintenance status, and was eventually closed in 1962. Civil use Memorial To Aircrew. Memorial to aircrew killed during take off 19 Dec. 1944 in a field near the end of the runway more info on the airfield. With the end of military control, the main airfield buildings, hangars, control tower, etc., were demolished. However, on some of the dispersed sites to the east of the airfield quite a number of the buildings remain and are used by a farmer for a variety of purposes. Most of the hardstands have gone. The main runways (with the exception of one which remains almost complete) and taxiways were broken up for aggregate and used for various construction projects. A stone memorial plaque was dedicated during a veterans' reunion in 1987. It stands in a small plot on one of the old barrack sites just off the lane from Hempnall which runs to the east of the airfield. A small private museum has been established in some of the remaining Nissen huts on one of the dispersed sites on Airfield Farm. It contains general 8th A.F. memorabilia, material on the 93rd B.G., and items recovered by the East Anglian Aircraft Research Group. A company by the name of Mindacre Ltd., run by Roy Slarke of Bungay, used the airfield as their main base for aerial application operations, and had at one time six Cessna A188 Agwagons stationed at field. Pilots and engineers from both the UK, Norway, Australia and New Zealand had Hardwick as their home base, and carried out aerial application contracts all over the UK. In 1973 the company won a contract spraying cotton fields in the Gezira, Sudan, Africa, and four Agwagons and one Cessna 206 departed Hardwick and flew to the Sudan, returning six months later. Cpt. Harald Olsen of Norway worked for Mindacre Ltd., from 1972 until completion of the contract in the Sudan in 1974.

This notice was not widely disseminated, and many villagers gathered in the Bagh to celebrate the important Indian festival of Baisakhi, and peacefully protest the arrest and deportation of two national leaders, Satyapal and Saifuddin Kitchlew. Dyer and his troops entered the garden, blocking the main entrance behind them, took up position on a raised bank, and with no warning opened fire on the crowd for about ten minutes, directing their bullets largely towards the few open gates through which people were trying to flee, until the ammunition supply was almost exhausted. The following day Dyer stated in a report that \\"I have heard that between 200 and 300 of the crowd were killed. My party fired 1,650 rounds\\". The Hunter Commission report published the following year by the Government of India criticised both Dyer personally and also the Government of the Punjab for failing to compile a detailed casualty count, and quoted a figure offered by the Sewa Samati (a Social Services Society) of 379 identified dead, and approximately 1,200 wounded, of whom 192 were seriously injured. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead. Dyer was lauded for his actions by some in Britain, and indeed became a hero among many of those who were directly benefiting from the British Raj,Derek Sayer, \\"British Reaction to the Amritsar Massacre 1919‚Äì1920\\", Past & Present,' May 1991, Issue 131, pp 130‚Äì164 such as members of the House of Lords. He was, however, widely denounced and criticised in the House of Commons, whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him. Because he was a soldier acting on orders, he could not be tried for murder. The military chose not to bring him before a court-martial, and his only punishment was to be removed from his current appointment, turned down for a proposed promotion, and barred from further employment in India. Dyer subsequently retired from the army and returned to England, where he died, unrepentant about his actions, in 1927. Responses polarized both the British and Indian peoples. Eminent author Rudyard Kipling declared at the time that Dyer \\"did his duty as he saw it\\".Nigel Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar, p. 430. This incident shocked Rabindranath Tagore (the first Indian and Asian Nobel laureate) to such an extent that he renounced his knighthood and stated that \\"such mass murderers aren't worthy of giving any title to anyone\\". The massacre caused a re-evaluation by the British Army of its military role against civilians to minimal force whenever possible, although later British actions during the Mau Mau insurgencies in Kenya have led historian Huw Bennett to note that the new policy was not always carried out.Huw Bennett, Fighting the Mau Mau: The British Army and Counter-Insurgency in Kenya The army was retrained and developed less violent tactics for crowd control.Srinath Raghaven, \\"Protecting the Raj: The Army in India and Internal Security, c. 1919‚Äì39\\", Small Wars and Insurgencies, (Fall 2005), 16#3 pp 253‚Äì279 online The level of casual brutality, and lack of any accountability, stunned the entire nation,Bipan Chandra et al, India's Struggle for Independence, Viking 1988, p. 166 resulting in a wrenching loss of faith of the general Indian public in the intentions of the UK. p.169 The ineffective inquiry, together with the initial accolades for Dyer, fuelled great widespread anger against the British among the Indian populace, leading to the Non-cooperation Movement of 1920‚Äì22. Some historians consider the episode a decisive step towards the end of British rule in India. Britain never formally apologised for the massacre but expressed \\"regret\\" in 2019. Background Defence of India Act During World War I, British India contributed to the British war effort by providing men and resources. Millions of Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian administration and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. However, Bengal and Punjab remained sources of anticolonial activities. Revolutionary attacks in Bengal, associated increasingly with disturbances in Punjab, were significant enough to nearly paralyse the regional administration. Of these, a pan-Indian mutiny in the British Indian Army planned for February 1915 was the most prominent amongst a number of plots formulated between 1914 and 1917 by Indian nationalists in India, the United States and Germany. The planned February mutiny was ultimately thwarted when British intelligence infiltrated the Ghadarite movement, arresting key figures. Mutinies in smaller units and garrisons within India were also crushed. In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, the Defence of India Act 1915 was passed limiting civil and political liberties. Michael O'Dwyer, then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, was one of the strongest proponents of the act, in no small part due to the Ghadarite threat in the province. The Rowlatt Act The Act was passed on 18 March 1919. The costs of the protracted war in money and manpower were great. High casualty rates in the war, increasing inflation after the end, compounded by heavy taxation, the deadly 1918 flu pandemic, and the disruption of trade during the war escalated human suffering in India. The pre-war Indian nationalist sentiment was revived as moderate and extremist groups of the Indian National Congress ended their differences to unify. In 1916, the Congress was successful in establishing the Lucknow Pact, a temporary alliance with the All-India Muslim League. British political concessions and Whitehall's India Policy after World War I began to change, with the passage of Montagu‚ÄìChelmsford Reforms, which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917. However, this was deemed insufficient in reforms by the Indian political movement. Mahatma Gandhi, recently returned to India, began emerging as an increasingly charismatic leader under whose leadership civil disobedience movements grew rapidly as an expression of political unrest. The recently crushed Ghadar conspiracy, the presence of Mahendra Pratap's Kabul mission in Afghanistan (with possible links to then nascent Bolshevik Russia), and a still-active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal (as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt, an English judge. It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal. On the recommendations of the committee, the Rowlatt Act, an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915, was enforced in India to limit civil liberties. The passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919 precipitated large scale political unrest throughout India. Ominously, in 1919, the Third Anglo- Afghan War began in the wake of Amir Habibullah's assassination and institution of Amanullah in a system strongly influenced by the political figures courted by the Kabul mission during the world war. As a reaction to the Rowlatt act, Muhammad Ali Jinnah resigned from his Bombay seat, writing in a letter to the Viceroy, \\"I, therefore, as a protest against the passing of the Bill and the manner in which it was passed tender my resignation.... ... a Government that passes or sanctions such a law in times of peace forfeits its claim to be called a civilized government\\". In India, Gandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt Act achieved an unprecedented response of furious unrest and protests. Before the massacre The Jallianwalla Bagh in 1919, months after the massacre Especially in Punjab, the situation was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph, and communication systems. The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that \\"practically the whole of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000\\". Many officers in the Indian army believed revolt was possible, and they prepared for the worst. The British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Michael O'Dwyer, is said to have believed that these were the early and ill- concealed signs of a conspiracy for a coordinated revolt planned around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have withdrawn to the hills for the summer. The Amritsar massacre and other events at about the same time, have been described by some historians as the end result of a concerted plan by the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tense situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre. On 10 April 1919, there was a protest at the residence of Miles Irving, the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar. The demonstration was to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, who had been earlier arrested by the government and moved to a secret location. Both were proponents of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi. A military picket shot at the crowd, killing several protesters and setting off a series of violent events. Riotous crowds carried out arson attacks on British banks, killed several British people and assaulted two British females. All native men were forced to crawl the Kucha Kurrichhan on their hands and knees as punishment, 1919 On 11 April, Marcella Sherwood, an elderly English missionary, fearing for the safety of the approximately 600 Indian children under her care, was on her way to shut the schools and send the children home. While travelling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob who violently attacked her. She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh Fort. After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer, enraged at the assault, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on his hands and knees as a punishment. Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: \\"Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too.\\" He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing him \\"as the saviour of the Punjab\\". For the next two days, the city of Amritsar was quiet, but violence continued in other parts of Punjab. Railway lines were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of Punjab under martial law. The legislation restricted a number of civil liberties, including freedom of assembly; gatherings of more than four people were banned.Townshend, Britain's Civil Wars. p 137 On the evening of 12 April, the leaders of the hartal in Amritsar held a meeting at the Hindu College - Dhab Khatikan. At the meeting, Hans Raj, an aide to Kitchlew, announced a public protest meeting would be held at 18:30 the following day in the Jallianwala Bagh, to be organised by Muhammad Bashir and chaired by a senior and respected Congress Party leader, Lal Kanhyalal Bhatia. A series of resolutions protesting against the Rowlatt Act, the recent actions of the British authorities and the detention of Satyapal and Kitchlew was drawn up and approved, after which the meeting adjourned.Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar p. 246 Massacre The Martyrs' Well, at Jallianwala Bagh. 120 bodies were recovered from this well as per inscription on it.Jallianwala Bagh Massacre At 9:00 on the morning of 13 April 1919, the traditional festival of Baisakhi. Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar p. 252-253 Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar p. 253 By mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh (garden) near the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar p. 254-255 In the center of the Bagh was a samadhi (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter. Apart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh. Dyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the Hunter Commission estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival. Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving. An hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the Gurkha Rifles, the 54th Sikhs and the 59th Sind Rifles . Fifty of them were armed with .303 Lee‚ÄìEnfield bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles. Dyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \\"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\\"Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer p 255-58 Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent. Apart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.Collett, Nigel (2006). The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer. Hambledon Continuum: New Edition. p. 254-255 Casualties The number of total casualties is disputed. The following morning's newspapers quoted an erroneous initial figure of 200 casualties, offered by the Associated Press, e.g. The Government of Punjab, criticised by the Hunter Commission for not gathering accurate figures, only offered the same approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher. The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded. The Hunter Commission based their figures of 379 deaths, and approximately 3 times this injured on this, suggesting 1500 casualties. At the meeting of the Imperial Legislative Council held on 12 September 1919, the investigation led by Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya concluded that there were 42 boys among the dead, the youngest of them only 7 months old. The Hunter commission confirmed the deaths of 337 men, 41 boys and a six-week old baby. In July 1919, three months after the massacre, officials were tasked with finding who had been killed by inviting inhabitants of the city to volunteer information about those who had died. This information was incomplete due to fear that those who participated would be identified as having been present at the meeting, and some of the dead may not have had close relations in the area. Winston Churchill reported nearly 400 slaughtered, and 3 or 4 times the number wounded to the Westminster Parliament, on 8 July 1920. Since the official figures were obviously flawed regarding the size of the crowd (6,000‚Äì20,000), the number of rounds fired and the period of shooting, the Indian National Congress instituted a separate inquiry of its own, with conclusions that differed considerably from the British Government's inquiry. The casualty number quoted by the Congress was more than 1,500, with approximately 1,000 being killed. Indian nationalist Swami Shraddhanand wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919. Aftermath This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their previous loyalty to the British and become nationalists distrustful of British rule. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been \\"confronted by a revolutionary army\\", to which Major General William Beynon replied: \\"Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves.\\"Nigel Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer (2006) p. 267 O'Dwyer requested that martial law should be imposed upon Amritsar and other areas, and this was granted by Viceroy Lord Chelmsford.Derek Sayer, \\"British Reaction to the Amritsar Massacre 1919‚Äì1920\\", Past & Present, May 1991, Issue 131, p.142Nigel Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer (2006) p. 372 Both Secretary of State for War Winston Churchill and former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as \\"unutterably monstrous\\", while Asquith called it \\"one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history\\".Derek Sayer, \\"British Reaction to the Amritsar Massacre 1919‚Äì1920\\", Past & Present, May 1991, Issue 131, p.131 Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said, \\"The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything‚Ä¶ When fire had been opened upon it to disperse it, it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides. Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.\\" After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government. Cloake reports that despite the official rebuke, many Britons still \\"thought him a hero for saving the rule of British law in India.\\" Rabindranath Tagore received the news of the massacre by 22 May 1919. He tried to arrange a protest meeting in Calcutta and finally decided to renounce his British knighthood as \\"a symbolic act of protest\\". In the repudiation letter, dated 30 May 1919 and addressed to the Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford, he wrote \\"I ... wish to stand, shorn, of all special distinctions, by the side of those of my countrymen who, for their so called insignificance, are liable to suffer degradation not fit for human beings.\\" Gupta describes the letter written by Tagore as \\"historic\\". He writes that Tagore \\"renounced his knighthood in protest against the inhuman cruelty of the British Army to the people of Punjab\\", and he quotes Tagore's letter to the Viceroy \\"The enormity of the measures taken by the Government in Punjab for quelling some local disturbances has, with a rude shock, revealed to our minds the helplessness of our position as British subjects in India ... [T]he very least that I can do for my country is to take all consequences upon myself in giving voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised into dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation...\\" English Writings of Rabindranath Tagore Miscellaneous Writings Vol# 8 carries a facsimile of this hand written letter. Disorders Inquiry Committee 1919-1920 (report) Calcutta- Superintendent Government Printing, India 1920 Hunter Commission On 14 October 1919, after orders issued by the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, the Government of India announced the formation of a committee of inquiry into the events in Punjab. Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, William, Lord Hunter, former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \\"investigate the recent disturbances in Bombay, Delhi and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\\". The members of the commission were: *Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission *Mr Justice George C. Rankin of Calcutta *Sir Chimanlal Harilal Setalvad, Vice- Chancellor of Bombay University and advocate of the Bombay High Court *W.F. Rice, member of the Home Department *Major-General Sir George Barrow, KCB, KCMG, GOC Peshawar Division *Pandit Jagat Narayan, lawyer and Member of the Legislative Council of the United Provinces *Thomas Smith, Member of the Legislative Council of the United Provinces *Sardar Sahibzada Sultan Ahmad Khan, lawyer from Gwalior State *H.C. Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department After meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries. After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar. On 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone. Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \\"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\\"Steven Patterson, The cult of imperial honor in British India (2009) P. 67 Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \\"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\\". After Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired: Dyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \\"rebels\\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.Nick Lloyd, The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day (2011) p. 157 He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \\"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\\"Collett, The Butcher of Amritsar p. 337 Exhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known. Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with jaundice and arteriosclerosis, and was hospitalised. Although the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions. In \\"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\\"Cyril Henry Philips, \\"The evolution of India and Pakistan, 1858 to 1947: select documents\\" p.214. Oxford University Press, 1962 Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \\"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir Michael O'Dwyer was of the same view\\", they wrote, \\"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\\" The report concluded that: * Lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error. * The length of firing showed a grave error. * Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned. * Dyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority. * There had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab. The minority report of the Indian members further added that: * Proclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed. * Innocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand. * Dyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so. * Dyer's actions had been \\"inhuman and un-British\\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India. The Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council). The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920. Reginald Dyer was disciplined by being removed from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from further employment in India. He died in 1927. Demonstration at Gujranwala Two days later, on 15 April, demonstrations occurred in Gujranwala protesting against the killings at Amritsar. Police and aircraft were used against the demonstrators, resulting in 12 deaths and 27 injuries. The Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force in India, Brigadier General N D K MacEwen stated later that: > I think we can fairly claim to have been of great use in the late riots, > particularly at Gujranwala, where the crowd when looking at its nastiest was > absolutely dispersed by a machine using bombs and Lewis guns. Assassination of Michael O'Dwyer Michael O'Dwyer c. 1912 On 13 March 1940, at Caxton Hall in London, Udham Singh, an Indian independence activist from Sunam who had witnessed the events in Amritsar and had himself been wounded, shot and killed Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre, who had approved Dyer's action and was believed to have been the main planner. Some, such as the nationalist newspaper Amrita Bazar Patrika, made statements supporting the killing. The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \\"fighter for freedom\\" and his action was referred to in The Times newspaper as \\"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\\".The Times, London, 16 March 1940 Reporter and historian William L. Shirer wrote the next day, \\"Most of the other Indians I know [other than Gandhi] will feel this is divine retribution. O'Dwyer bore a share of responsibility in the 1919 Amritsar massacre, in which Gen. Dyer shot 1,500 Indians in cold blood. When I was at Amritsar eleven years after [the massacre] in 1930, the bitterness still stuck in the people there.\\" In Fascist countries, the incident was used for anti-British propaganda: Bergeret, published in large scale from Rome at that time, while commenting upon the Caxton Hall assassination, ascribed the greatest significance to the circumstance and praised the action of Udham Singh as courageous.Public and Judicial Department, File No L/P + J/7/3822, Caxton Hall outrage, India Office Library and Records, London, pp 13‚Äì14 The Berliner B√∂rsen Zeitung termed the event \\"The torch of Indian freedom\\". German radio reportedly broadcast: \\"The cry of tormented people spoke with shots.\\" At a public meeting in Kanpur, a spokesman had stated that \\"at last an insult and humiliation of the nation had been avenged\\". Similar sentiments were expressed in numerous other places across the country.Government of India, Home Department, Political File No , National Archives of India, New Delhi, p40 Fortnightly reports of the political situation in Bihar mentioned: \\"It is true that we had no love lost for Sir Michael. The indignities he heaped upon our countrymen in Punjab have not been forgotten.\\" In its 18 March 1940 issue Amrita Bazar Patrika wrote: \\"O'Dwyer's name is connected with Punjab incidents which India will never forget.\\" The New Statesman observed: \\"British conservativism has not discovered how to deal with Ireland after two centuries of rule. Similar comment may be made on British rule in India. Will the historians of the future have to record that it was not the Nazis but the British ruling class which destroyed the British Empire?\\" Singh had told the court at his trial: Wide view of Jallianwala Bagh memorial > I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved it. He was the real > culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my people, so I have crushed him. > For full 21 years, I have been trying to wreak vengeance. I am happy that I > have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I > have seen my people starving in India under the British rule.

What greater honour could be > bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?CRIM 1/1177, Public > Record Office, London, p 64 Singh was hanged for the murder on 31 July 1940. At that time, many, including Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous. In 1952, Nehru (by then Prime Minister) honoured Udham Singh with the following statement, which appeared in the daily Partap: > I salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose > so that we may be free. Soon after this recognition by the Prime Minister, Udham Singh received the title of Shaheed, a name given to someone who has attained martyrdom or done something heroic on behalf of their country or religion. Monument and legacy Entrance to the present-day Jallianwala Bagh. Memorial plaque at Jallianwala Bagh. Memorial plaque in passageway of Jallianwala Bagh site. Bullet holes in wall at Jallianwala Bagh memorial. Martyrs Well at the Jallianwala Bagh memorial. A trust was founded in 1920 to build a memorial at the site after a resolution was passed by the Indian National Congress. In 1923, the trust purchased land for the project. A memorial, designed by American architect Benjamin Polk, was built on the site and inaugurated by President of India Rajendra Prasad on 13 April 1961, in the presence of Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders. A flame was later added to the site. The bullet marks remain on the walls and adjoining buildings to this day. The well into which many people jumped and drowned attempting to save themselves from the bullets is also a protected monument inside the park. Formation of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee Shortly following the massacre, the official Sikh clergy of the Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) in Amritsar conferred upon Colonel Dyer the Saropa (the mark of distinguished service to the Sikh faith or, in general, humanity), sending shock waves among the Sikh community.Ajit Singh Sarhadi, \\"Punjabi Suba: The Story of the Struggle\\", Kapur Printing Press, Delhi, 1970, p. 19. On 12 October 1920, students and faculty of the Amritsar Khalsa College called a meeting to strengthen the Nationalistic Movement.Ajit Singh Sarhadi, \\"Punjabi Suba: The Story of the Struggle\\", Kapur Printing Press, Delhi, 1970, p. 19. The students pushed for an anti-British movement and the result was the formation of the Shiromani Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee on 15 November 1920 to manage and to implement reforms in Sikh shrines. Visit by Queen Elizabeth II Although Queen Elizabeth II had not made any comments on the incident during her state visits in 1961 and 1983, she spoke about the events at a state banquet in India on 13 October 1997: > It is no secret that there have been some difficult episodes in our past ‚Äì > Jallianwala Bagh, which I shall visit tomorrow, is a distressing example. > But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish > otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn > from the sadness and build on the gladness. On 14 October 1997, Queen Elizabeth II visited Jallianwala Bagh and paid her respects with a 30‚Äësecond moment of silence. During the visit, she wore a dress of a colour described as pink apricot or saffron, which was of religious significance to the Sikhs. She removed her shoes while visiting the monument and laid a wreath at the monument. While some Indians welcomed the expression of regret and sadness in the Queen's statement, others criticised it for being less than an apology. The then Prime Minister of India Inder Kumar Gujral defended the Queen, saying that the Queen herself had not even been born at the time of the events and should not be required to apologise. The Queen's 1997 statement was not without controversies. During her visit there were protests in the city of Amritsar, with people waving black flags and chanting the insult \\"Queen, go back.\\" Queen Elizabeth and the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh merely signed the visitor's book. The fact that they did not leave any comment, regretting the incident was criticized. During the same visit, minutes after Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip stood in silence at the Flame of Liberty, the Prince and his guide, Partha Sarathi Mukherjee, reachedhttps://frontline.thehindu.com/social-issues/article30160325.ece a plaque recording the events of the 1919 massacre. Among the many things found on the plaque was the assertion that 2,000 people were killed in the massacre. (The precise text is: \\"This place is saturated with the blood of about two thousand Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims who were martyred in a non-violent struggle.\\" It goes on to describe the events of that day.)http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1422/14220460.htm \\"That's a bit exaggerated,\\" Philip told Mukherjee, \\"it must include the wounded.\\" Mukherjee asked Philip how he had come to this conclusion. \\"I was told about the killings by General Dyer's son,\\" Mukherjee recalls the Duke as saying, \\"I'd met him while I was in the Navy.\\" These statements by Philip drew widespread condemnation in India. Indian journalist Praveen Swami wrote in the Frontline magazine: \\"(The fact that)... this was the solitary comment Prince Philip had to offer after his visit to Jallianwala Bagh... (and that) it was the only aspect of the massacre that exercised his imagination, caused offence. It suggested that the death of 379 people was in some way inadequate to appall the royal conscience, in the way the death of 2,000 people would have. Perhaps more important of all, the staggering arrogance that Prince Philip displayed in citing his source of information on the tragedy made clear the lack of integrity in the wreath-laying.\\" Demands for apology There are long- standing demands in India that Britain should apologize for the massacre. Winston Churchill, on 8 July 1920, urged the House of Commons to punish Colonel Dyer. Churchill, who described the massacre as \\"monstrous\\", succeeded in persuading the House to forcibly retire Colonel Dyer, but would have preferred to have seen the colonel disciplined. An apology was made at the time in a statement made by Sir William Vincent, the home member of the Viceroy's Council in a debate on the Punjab disturbances. This made clear the deep regret of the Government of India. It made clear that the actions taken were wrong and repudiated by the Government. It was called a noteworthy case of improper action; \\"overdrastic and severe action, excessive use of force and acts ...... reasonably interpreted as designed to humiliate Indian people ...... cannot but be regarded as unpardonable (and) morally indefensible.\\" In addition, the Indian Government reported in despatches to the UK government that the actions of General Dyer were far beyond what was necessary. Also, General Dyer acted far beyond the principle of using reasonable and minimum force. Sir William Vincent stated that the actions of Dyer were of deep regret. A manual of instructions was created post the massacre to instruct officers in their use of force and this was to be avoided unless absolutely necessary.p 72 Legislative Assembly Debates, Government Central Press, Simla 15 February 1921 In February 2013 David Cameron became the first serving British Prime Minister to visit the site, laid a wreath at the memorial, and described the Amritsar massacre as \\"a deeply shameful event in British history, one that Winston Churchill rightly described at that time as monstrous. We must never forget what happened here and we must ensure that the UK stands up for the right of peaceful protests\\". Cameron did not deliver an official apology. This was criticized by some commentators. Writing in The Telegraph, Sankarshan Thakur wrote, \\"Over nearly a century now British protagonists have approached the 1919 massacre ground of Jallianwala Bagh thumbing the thesaurus for an appropriate word to pick. 'Sorry' has not been among them.\\" Jallianwala Bagh memorial The issue of apology resurfaced during the 2016 India visit of Prince William and Kate Middleton when both decided to skip the memorial site from their itinerary. In 2017, Indian author and politician Shashi Tharoor suggested that the Jalianwala Bagh centenary in 2019 could be a \\"good time\\" for the British to apologise to the Indians for wrongs committed during the colonial rule. Visiting the memorial on 6 December 2017, London's mayor Sadiq Khan called on the British government to apologize for the massacre. In February 2019 the British House of Lords began discussing and debating the massacre. On 12 April 2019, a ceremony was held in Amritsar just before the centenary anniversary of the massacre. Although she did not issue an apology, British Prime Minister Theresa May called the 1919 shooting of unarmed civilians a \\"shameful scar\\", echoing the 2013 statement, made by David Cameron. National Memorial Event in the UK On 15th April 2019, a national memorial event was held in the British Parliament hosted by Jasvir Singh and organised by City Sikhs and the Faiths Forum for London entitled 'Jallianwala Bagh 100 Years On', where testimonies of survivors were read out from the book 'Eyewitness at Amritsar'https://www.kashihouse.com/books/eyewitness-at-amritsar-a-visual- history-of-the-1919-jallianwala-bagh-massacre, there were traditional musical performances, and a minute's silence was held to remember those who had been killed a century earlier.http://faithsforum.com/jallianwala-bagh-100-years-on/ The Asian Awards In April 2019 The Asian Awards honoured the Martyrs of Jalianwala Bagh with the prestigious Founders Award.

The airfield is also known after the village of Flixton, near which it was built.  History  Bungay airfield was originally planned as a satellite for nearby RAF Hardwick and was constructed by Kirk & Kirk Ltd., during 1942 with a main runway of 6,000 feet in length and two intersecting secondary runways, one of 4,220 feet and the other of 4,200 feet. In common with other airfields of the period, the technical, administrative and domestic buildings were dispersed to lessen the impact of any enemy air attack. The buildings were all of a temporary nature and the various sites were chiefly to the west of the airfield. United States Army Air Forces use The airfield was allocated to the Americans and transferred to the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force and designated Station 125. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Bungay were: * 460th Sub-Depot (VIII Air Force Service Command) * Quartermaster Depot Q-104 * 18th Weather Squadron * 25th Station Complement Squadron * 555th Quartermaster Battalion * 1214th Quartermaster Company * 1248th Military Police Company * 1821st Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 885th Chemical Company * 979th Quartermaster Service Company * 987th Military Police Company * 2035th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon * 212nd Finance Section * 558th Army Postal Unit  428th Bombardment Squadron  Bungay was still unfinished when the Twelfth Air Force 428th Bombardment Squadron, 310th Bombardment Group (Medium) at RAF Hardwick arrived with fourteen North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers in October 1942. The squadron moved on to M√©diouna Airfield, French Morocco on 18 November 1942. A 12th Air Force film clip indicates that the 310th Bombardment Group was the first 12th Air Force group to fly the northern transport route from the United States to Europe and initially arrived at Prestwick, Scotland in October 1942.  329th Bombardment Squadron  In December 1942, eight Consolidated B-24 Liberators of the 329th Bombardment Squadron, 93d Bombardment Group (Heavy) at RAF Hardwick were sent to Bungay to prepare for special intruder operations. These aircraft conducted raids in bad weather with the mission of harassing the German air raid warning system. The 329th flew these missions until March 1943 when they rejoined the 93d at Hardwick.  446th Bombardment Group (Heavy)  A bomber crew, led by Lieutenant Grant, of the 706th Bomb Squadron, 446th Bomb Group with their B-24J-155-CO Liberator (RT-H, serial number 44-40268) nicknamed \\"Kentucky Belle\\".

Additional construction was performed at Bungay until November 1943 when the airfield received the Eighth Air Force 446th Bombardment Group (Heavy) from Lowry AAF, Colorado. The 446th was assigned to the 20th Combat Bombardment Wing and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-H\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 704th Bombardment Squadron (FL) * 705th Bombardment Squadron (HN) * 706th Bombardment Squadron (RT) * 707th Bombardment Squadron (JU) The 446th operated chiefly against strategic objectives on the Continent from December 1943 until April 1945. Targets included U-boat installations at Kiel, the port at Bremen, a chemical plant at Ludwigshafen, ball-bearing works at Berlin, aero-engine plants at Rostock, aircraft factories at Munich, marshalling yards at Coblenz, motor works at Ulm, and oil refineries at Hamburg. Besides strategic missions, the group often carried out support and interdictory operations. It supported the Normandy landings in June 1944 by attacking strong points, bridges, airfields, transportation, and other targets in France. It aided ground forces at Caen and Saint-L√¥ during July by hitting bridges, gun batteries, and enemy troops. Dropped supplies to Allied troops near Nijmegen during the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September. Bombed marshalling yards, bridges, and road junctions during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 - January 1945. Dropped supplies to airborne and ground troops near Wesel during the Allied assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The 446th Bomb Group flew its last combat mission on 25 April, attacking a bridge near Salzburg. It returned to Sioux Falls AAF, South Dakota, during June and July 1945, being inactivated there on 18 August 1945. The Pima Air & Space Museum as of 2013 has a Liberator N7866 with nose art \\"Bungay Buckaroo\\" related to the 446th Bomb Group stationed at Bungay in 1944. Royal Navy/Royal Air Force use After the war, the field was transferred to the Royal Navy and the station became ', being the satellite of HMS Sparrowhawk (RNAS Hatston) where three Fleet Air Arm squadrons were located. In 1946 it was returned to RAF control and was assigned to No. 53 Maintenance Unit RAF and became a maintenance sub-unit of No. 94 MU RAF which had its HQ at RAF Great Ashfield. Stored on the runways and in the buildings, were 250 lb., 500 lb., 2000 lb., and 4,000 lb. bombs, balloon cable cutting cartridges, depth charges, 7-inch parachute flares and German ammunition. The latter two items were eventually taken to 53 MU at RAF Pulham, and destroyed there. Some time in July 1949, the site was taken over by 53 MU until Bungay's closure in 1955. The airfield was eventually put up for sale and disposed of in 1961/1962. Post war A view inside part of the Flixton Air Museum With the end of military control Bungay airfield was the location of the Martlesham Heath Parachute Club, with Cessna 182 G-ATNU and crop sprayers, including Pawnee D G-BFRY. In 1981-82, the Flixton Church Roof Restoration Fund held mini air shows. Until 1983, the main runway and peritrack were in good condition, but the following year work started on breaking them up. In the spring of 1986 a new set of oak gates were hung at St Mary's Church, Flixton, which stands close to the old airfield. These were bought as a result of donations by veterans of the 446th BG to replace those originally presented in 1945 by the Americans at Flixton. A small memorial plaque carries the inscription, \\"These gates were presented in memory of the men of the 446th Bombardment Group, USAAF, who gave their lives in the defence of freedom, 1941-1945\\". Current use Of the airfield itself, most of the wartime buildings, including the control tower and hangars, have long since been demolished and the airfield has largely returned to agricultural use. Several buildings in the technical site survive, with wartime paintings on the inside walls of the former dining hall. The former airfield is the home of 2 Sisters Food Group Buxted Chickens factory. There is also a large mushroom farm. In the early 2000s, Bungay's largest employer Clays, then part of St Ives Group, failed to gain planning permission to re-site their printing factory on the airfield. Norfolk and Suffolk Aviation Museum An aircraft museum has been established since 1972 next to the Buck Inn, Flixton, approximately northwest of the airfield site. It contains many displays of aircraft and other aviation artefacts, including much on the 446th Bomb Group.

History Swami Vivekananda (on the chair, third from left) and Biligiri Iyengar (on the floor, second from left) at the Ice House in 1897 In 1842, Frederic Tudor constructed the building facing the Bay of Bengal as a facility to store ice. In 1880, the business collapsed and the building was sold to Biligiri Iyengar, an advocate in the Madras High Court. Iyengar re-modeled the house and named it Castle Kernan after his friend and judge in Madras High Court.

The encircling perimeter track was three miles long. To meet United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) requirements, there were fifty-one hardstands both of the loop and frying-pan type and two T-2 hangars, placed one on each side of the airfield, that on the south being adjacent to the technical site. The camp was of temporary buildings and the sites dispersed in farmlands to the south of the airfield. USAAF use The airfield was assigned USAAF designation Station 146. Its ID Code was \\"SE\\". 448th Bombardment Group (Heavy) The airfield was opened on 1 December 1943 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 448th Bombardment Group (Heavy).

The group entered combat on 22 December 1943, and until April 1945 served primarily as a strategic bombardment organization, hitting such targets as aircraft factories in Gotha, ball-bearing plants in Berlin, an airfield at Hanau, U-boat facilities at Kiel, a chemical plant at Ludwigshafen, synthetic oil refineries at P√∂litz, aircraft engine plants at Rostock, marshalling yards at Cologne, and a Buzz- bomb assembly plant at Fallersleben. The group took part in the intensive campaign of heavy bombers against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20‚Äì25 February 1944. In addition to strategic operations, flew interdictory and support missions. Bombed V-weapon sites, airfields, and transportation facilities prior to the Normandy invasion in June 1944, and on D-Day attacked coastal defenses and choke points. Struck enemy positions to assist the Allied offensive at Caen and the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July. Dropped supplies to airborne troops near Nijmegen during the airborne attack on the Netherlands in September. Bombed transportation and communications centers in the combat zone during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945. Dropped supplies to troops at Wesel during the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. The group flew its last combat mission on 25 April, attacking a marshalling yard at Salzburg. It returned to Sioux Falls AAF South Dakota the US in July 1945. After the war, the airfield was used by Royal Air Force units: * No. 53 Maintenance Unit RAF * No. 94 Maintenance Unit RAF The airfield was closed in 1945. Current use With the end of military control, most of the airfield was reverted to farming. The eastern section, including part of the main runway and a section of perimeter track, is now Seething Airfield which is home to the Waveney Flying Group. They have built three hangars and a clubroom and the airfield is active most days of the week. To the south of the airfield, on some of the former dispersed barrack and communal sites, several of the old living quarters and associated buildings are still in existence. Some of these buildings are in a reasonable condition, although they are derelict and overgrown. The former control tower has been renovated and has become a memorial museum to the 448th B.G. It contains a Group Roll of Honor and various artifacts and memorabilia. It is open to the public on the first Sunday of the month May to October, but can be inspected at other times by special request. In front of the control tower, dedicated during a veterans' reunion in 1990, stands a memorial to the men of the 448th B.G. who were missing or killed in action during service at Seething. Two other memorials were dedicated during a veterans' reunion in 1984. One is on the airfield itself near the Waveney F.G. club-house and consists of an engraved stone plaque and rose garden; another similar plaque is in the churchyard of Seething Parish Church, which is a mile or so north of the airfield. The \\"Stars and Stripes\\" hang in the church itself while an oak sapling has been planted near the village hall to commemorate the Group's close association with the village.

United States Army Air Forces use Halesworth was built in 1942-1943 and was intended for use as a bomber station, and was built as such with a 6,000 ft. main runway and two secondary runways of 4,200 ft length. There was an encircling perimeter track with 51 hardstands and two T-2 hangars. Nissen hut accommodations for about 3,000 personnel were also built south of the airfield. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Halesworth were: * 474th Sub-Depot * 18th Weather Squadron * 328th Station Complement Squadron * Headquarters (95th Combat Bomb Wing) Regular Army Station Units included: * 1235th Quartermaster Company * 1800th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 867th Chemical Company * 983rd Military Police Company * 2106th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon The airfield was assigned USAAF designation Station 365 (HA).  56th Fighter Group  Captain Walker \\"Bud\\" Mahurin of the 56th Fighter Group standing on the port wing of his P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft, conversing with its crew chief, Staff Sergeant John E. Barnes.The aircraft had been \\"bought\\" courtesy of war bonds purchased (to a value approximately equivalent to the cost of a fighter) by the citizens of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Consequently, the name painted on the aircraft was chosen by Atlantic City. The first unit to use Halesworth was the 56th Fighter Group which arrived from RAF Horsham St Faith on 9 July 1943. Its operational squadrons were: * 61st Fighter Squadron (HV) * 62d Fighter Squadron (LM) * 63d Fighter Squadron (UN) Being only eight miles from the Suffolk coast, Halesworth was ideally located for escort fighter operations, where range was an important factor. For this reason the 56th Fighter Group was moved there. Flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, the group flew numerous missions over France, the Low Countries, and Germany to escort bombers attacking industrial establishments, V-weapon sites, submarine pens, and other targets on the Continent. In addition the 56th strafed and dive-bombed airfields, troops, and supply points; attacked the enemy communications; and flew counter-air patrols. The 56th became one of the most outstanding fighter organisations in the Eighth Air Force, producing many of the top fighter aces including Francis Gabreski and Robert S. Johnson. The group was responsible for pioneering most of the successful fighter escort tactics with the Thunderbolt and had many successes while operating from Halesworth. On 19 April 1944 the group had to vacate the airfield as it was needed for a new B-24 Liberator group and was transferred to RAF Boxted.  489th Bombardment Group (Heavy)  A B-24 Liberator (serial number 42-50437) nicknamed \\"Apassionata\\" of the 489th Bomb Group. Crew of B-24 Liberator \\"Jamaica\\". This crew flew 18 missions with the 466th BG before being transferred to the 389th BG for six missions, the 489th BG for three missions and then finishing up with the 492nd BG for the final three missions. The Eighth Air Force 489th Bombardment Group (Heavy) arrived at RAF Halesworth from Wendover AAF Utah on 1 May 1944. The group was assigned to the 20th Combat Bombardment Wing and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-W\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 844th Bombardment Squadron (4R) * 845th Bombardment Squadron (T4) * 846th Bombardment Squadron (8R) * 847th Bombardment Squadron (S4) The 489th flew the Consolidated B-24 Liberator as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The group entered combat on 30 May 1944, and during the next few days concentrated on targets in France in preparation for the Normandy invasion. In an attack against coastal defences near Wimereaux on 5 June 1944, the group's lead plane was seriously crippled by enemy fire, its pilot was killed, and the deputy group commander, Lt. Col. Leon R. Vance Jr., who was commanding the formation, was severely wounded; although his right foot was practically severed, Vance took control of the plane, led the group to a successful bombing of the target, and managed to fly the damaged aircraft to the coast of England, where he ordered the crew to bail out; believing a wounded man had been unable to jump, he ditched the plane in the English Channel and was rescued. For his action during this mission, Vance was awarded the Medal of Honor. The group supported the landings in Normandy on 6 June 1944, and afterward bombed coastal defences, airfields, bridges, railroads, and V-weapon sites in the campaign for France. It began flying missions into Germany in July, and engaged primarily in bombing strategic targets such as factories, oil refineries and storage plants, marshalling yards, and airfields in Ludwigshafen, Magdeburg, Brunswick, Saarbr√ºcken, and other cities until November 1944. Other operations included participating in the saturation bombing of German lines just before the breakthrough at Saint-L√¥ in July, dropping food to the liberated French and to Allied forces in France during August and September, and carrying food and ammunition to the Netherlands later in September. The 489th Bomb Group returned to Bradley AAF Connecticut in November 1944 to prepare for redeployment to the Pacific theater. Redesignated 489th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) in March 1945 and was re-equipped with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. The group was alerted for movement overseas in the summer of 1945, but war with Japan ended before the group left the US. Inactivated on 17 October 1945.  5th Emergency Rescue Squadron  Emblem of the 5th Emergency Rescue Squadron. Canadian Vickers OA-10A Catalina Serial Number 44-33987 of the 5th ERS. This aircraft was built in Canada under a Navy contract as a PBV-1A, then redesignated when delivered to the USAAF. In January 1945 the 5th Emergency Rescue Squadron moved to Halesworth from RAF Boxted with special P-47s, OA-10 Catalina amphibians and Boeing SB-17 Fortresses equipped with lifeboats for air-sea rescue work. The 5th ERS remained active, and it conducted many rescues until the end of hostilities. The airfield was also used until the end of the war as an operational training airfield for North American P-51 Mustang pilots. Post-war Governmental use After the war, the Halesworth was closed for flying in February 1946. It was turned over to the Ministry of Food for storage until it was sold in 1963. Civil use With the end of government control, the land was returned to agricultural use and little of the wartime buildings remains; a few derelict huts and ancillary buildings on some of the dispersed sites. Most of the remaining runways, perimeter track, etc. are now utilised as part of the Bernard Matthews turkey production site, with a number of large sheds erected on the runways. In May 1983 the 489th Bomb Group was permanently commemorated by the dedication of a granite memorial which has been erected on a small plot of land at the southern end of the old north-south runway. Adjacent to this is a memorial to the 56th Fighter Group who also flew from Halesworth. Nearby is the Halesworth Airfield Museum, whose exhibits include photographs, unit memorabilia and many other items relating to the airfield, its wartime occupants and activities. The museum displays a limited collection of 489th memorabilia, but the main 489th Bomb Group Museum, together with that of the 93rd Bomb Group, is sited at Hardwick, in Norfolk. The cockpit section of a C-54 is on display at the old combat mess site which is further along the road from the memorials, and a drop tank gives details of the three groups who served at Halesworth airfield during World War II. There is a wall plaque in nearby St. Peter's Church, Holton, in honour of all who flew from this airfield, and the church has kneelers made by 489th Bomb Group veterans' wives. Dotted around the site, at the edges of old runways and taxi paths, are a number of large wind turbines, and a large solar panel farm is at the western end of it. In February 2007, Halesworth was reported as the location for an outbreak of so-called 'bird flu', resulting in the culling of 159,000 turkeys at Bernard Matthews.

Looting of art, archaeology and other cultural property may be an opportunistic criminal act or may be a more organized case of unlawful or unethical pillage by the victor of a conflict. The term \\"looted art\\" reflects bias, and whether particular art has been taken legally or illegally is often the subject of conflicting laws and subjective interpretations of governments and people; use of the term \\"looted art\\" in reference to a particular art object implies that the art was taken illegally. Related terms include art theft (the stealing of valuable artifacts, mostly because of commercial reasons), illicit antiquities (covertly traded antiquities or artifacts of archaeological interest, found in illegal or unregulated excavations), provenance (the origin or source of a piece of art), and art repatriation (the process of returning artworks and antiques to their rightful owners). History Virgin and Child with St. John the Baptist and St. Stanis≈Çaw by Palma il Giovane was looted by Napoleon and returned to Warsaw in the 1820s. It was later destroyed by the Germans during the Warsaw Uprising. Art looting has a long history, the winning party of armed conflicts often plundering the loser, and in the absence of social order, the local population often joining in. The contents of nearly all the tombs of the Pharaohs were already completely looted by grave robbers before the invasion of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE. There have been a total of seven sackings of Rome. The Old Testament includes several references to looting and to the looting of art and treasures; in the Book of Chronicles it is said: \\"King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the Lord's temple and of the royal palace; he took everything, including the gold shields that Solomon had made\\",2 Chronicles. Chapter. 12:9. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C. and in the Book of Jeremiah 15:11 the Lord says: \\"Jerusalem, I will surely send you away for your own good. I will surely bring the enemy upon you in a time of trouble and distress ... I will give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder. I will give it away free of charge for the sins you have committed throughout your land.\\"Jeremiah 15:11. The NET Bible, New English Translation Bible (1996). Biblical Studies Press, L.L.C. Other famous examples include the Roman Sack of Corinth in 146 BC, the Sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, the Sack of Baghdad in 1258, Hern√°n Cort√©s and the looting of the Aztec gold. In only some of these was the removal of artworks for their own sake (rather than the value of their materials for example) a primary motivation. Since the rise of an art market for monumental sculpture, abandoned monuments all over the world have been at risk, notably in Iran, the old territories of Mesoamerican culture and Cambodia.Mydans, Seth. Raiders of Lost Art Loot Temples in Cambodia. New York Times, April 1, 1999,Section A, Page 4, Column 3, 1152 words After the looting of Europe by Napoleon, others copied the institutionalized model of systematic plunder and looting. During the American Civil War, legal frameworks and guidelines emerged that justified and legalized the plunder and looting of opposing parties and nations. Henry Wager Halleck, a United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer argued: \\"No belligerent would be justifiable in destroying temples, tombs, statutes [sic], paintings, or other works of art (except so far as their destruction may be the accidental or necessary result of military operations.) But, may he not seize and appropriate to his own use such works of genius and taste as belong to the hostile state, and are of a moveable character?\\".Halleck. International law, or, Rules regulating the intercourse of states in peace and war. Ch. XIX, Sections 10‚Äì11. (1861) In July 1862, Francis Lieber, a professor at Columbia College, who had worked with Halleck on guidelines for guerrilla warfare, was asked by Halleck, now General-in-Chief of armies of the Union, to develop a code of conduct for the armed forces. The code of conduct, published as General Orders No. 100 on April 24, 1863, signed by United States President Abraham Lincoln, later became known as the Lieber CodeFrancis Lieber, LL.D. Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field . Originally Issued as General Orders No. 100, Adjutant General's Office, 1863, Washington 1898: Government Printing Office and specifically authorized the Armies of the United States to plunder and loot the enemy ‚Äì a mindset that Hitler's armies copied one century later. The Lieber Code said in Article 36: \\"If such works of art, libraries, collections, or instruments belonging to a hostile nation or government, can be removed without injury, the ruler of the conquering state or nation may order them to be seized and removed for the benefit of the said nation. The ultimate ownership is to be settled by the ensuing treaty of peace.\\"Hartigan, Richard Shelly, ed. Lieber's Code and the Law of War. Chicago: Precedent, 1983.Friedman, Leon. The Law of War: A Documentary History. New York: Random House, 1972. Russian and American forces relied on similar frameworks when they plundered Germany after the defeat of the Nazis.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Looted Art. http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/bibliography/index.php?content=looted_art The Lieber Code further defined the conditions of looting and the relationship between private plunder and booty and institutionalized looting \\"All captures and booty belong, according to the modern law of war, primarily to the government of the captor.\\" (Article 45), \\"Neither officers nor soldiers are allowed to make use of their position or power in the hostile country for private gain, not even for commercial transactions otherwise legitimate.\\" (Article 46) and \\"... [I]f large sums are found upon the persons of prisoners, or in their possession, they shall be taken from them, and the surplus, after providing for their own support, appropriated for the use of the army, under the direction of the commander, unless otherwise ordered by the government.\\" (Article 72) Massive art looting occurred during World War II; see art theft during World War II. Looting of countries Looting of Afghanistan Many art pieces and artifacts from Afghanistan were looted during several wars; scores of artworks were smuggled to Britain and sold to wealthy collectors. \\"There are also fears that the bulk of the collection once in Kabul Museum, ... is now in smugglers' or collectors' hands.

Looting of Cyprus Following the invasion of Cyprus in 1974 by Turkey and the occupation of the northern part of the island, churches belonging to the Cypriot Orthodox Church have been looted in what is described as ‚Äúone of the most systematic examples of the looting of art since World War II‚Äù.Morris, Chris. ‚ÄúShame of Cyprus‚Äôs Looted Churches‚Äù.

Several-high-profile cases have made headline news on the international scene. Most notable was the case of the Kanakaria mosaics, 6th-century AD frescos that were removed from the original church, trafficked to the US and offered for sale to a museum for the sum of US$20,000,000. These were subsequently recovered by the Orthodox Church following a court case in Indianapolis. The northern part of the island is where the church and art looting was concentrated.‚ÄúCyprus History‚Äù. Byzantinefrescochapel.org. The Menil Collection. 2011. Web. 12 February 2012. < http://www.byzantinefrescochapel.org/cyprus-history/>. It is rumored that the Turkish-Cypriot leaders did not feel an obligation to preserve the artifacts and monuments in the north because they felt that the Greek-Cypriot government had oppressed them for too long. Archaeological sites, museums, churches, monasteries, castles, libraries, and private art collections have all been affected by the looting of the northern area of Cyprus; icons, frescoes, archaeological artifacts, and cultural heritage have been stripped from areas around the island and have been taken to places all over the world or simply destroyed.Jansen, Michael. ‚ÄúThe Pillage by Turkey of the 12,000 year old cultural heritage of Cyprus‚Äù.

Some believe that this has been done to ‚ÄòTurkify‚Äô the northern region of the country and erase the characteristics of the Cypriot predecessors, while people like Aydin Dikmen have been working to make money off of cultural heritage artifacts by selling them in international markets.‚ÄúTurkish Invasion and Cyprus Occupation‚Äù.

It was one of the most systematic examples of the looting of art since World War II.Shame of Cyprus's looted churches Non-Christian places of importance Many non-Christian sites have been affected by the looting and destruction of northern Cyprus. During the time of the invasion, work on archaeological sites was halted. While the projects on the Greek-Cypriot southern area were started again after a short period of delay, the projects in the Turkish north were never started again. Many of the houses and workshops associated with archaeological projects in the north were looted, so the work that had been done was lost to the researchers.Nicolaou, Kyriakos. 1976. ‚ÄúArchaeological News from Cyprus, 1974‚Äù. American Journal of Archaeology, 80 (4):361-375. Many areas on the island of Cyprus were damaged by bombing and machine gun fire, and because of these issues, the pavement mosaics of the House of Dionysos in Paphos suffered extensive damage. The fighting not only was destroying Byzantine and Christian cultural heritage, but it was even destroying culture that had been in existence for far longer. There have been appeals filed with UNESCO, ICOM, and ICOMOS to help with the preservation of the remaining cultural heritage on the island, and a representative of UNESCO was appointed to help by 1976. Looted religious sites and icons On the island of Cyprus before the invasion, the majority of the inhabitants were Greek-Cypriots, and for these citizens, the Greek Orthodox Church was and continues today to be central to their identity and faith. In the north, there is a fear that Christianity is dying out because the churches and monasteries have been destroyed, transformed, or are falling into ruin. The northern Turkish inhabitants have transformed some former religious sites into mosques, army barracks, stables, night clubs and hotels, and it has been documented that only 3 churches and 1 monastery are currently in a dignified state out of the 520 churches and monasteries that were in the northern area of the country before the Turkish invasion.‚ÄúGreek Orthodox Church sues Turkey Over Access to Religious Sites in Cyprus‚Äù. The Guardian. The Associated Press in Nicosia. 23 November 2009. Web. 9 February 2012. .Magister, Sandro. ‚ÄùCyprus: Portrait of a Christianity Obliterated‚Äù. Chiesa News. Gruppo Editoriale L‚ÄôEspresso Spa. 3 September 2006. Web. 9 February 2012. . At least 55 churches have been converted into mosques, while another 50 churches and monasteries have been converted into other structures to serve the Turkish-Cypriots‚Äô. A spokesman for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus stated that the transformations of buildings happened because the buildings were falling into ruin, and he also stated that it is an Ottoman custom to transform buildings attributed to other religions into mosques; this idea can be linked to other Islamic sites, like the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, Israel. Yannis Eliades, the director of the Byzantine Museum of Nicosia, has estimated that 25,000 icons have disappeared since the Turkish military initially invaded the island in 1974, while others estimate that between 15,000 and 20,000 icons are missing, along with dozens of frescoes and mosaics dating between the 6th and 15th centuries, thousands of chalices, wood carvings, crucifixes, and Bibles. However, there have been some case in which the Church of Cyprus was able to reclaim icons or mosaics, and this is a great step forward for the reformation of their cultural heritage. The transformations of religious sites have also spurred lawsuits from the few hundred Greek-Cypriots that are still living in the northern area. The Greek Orthodox Church has taken Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights because they were preventing practicing Christians from worshiping at previously religious, but currently transformed buildings. Even though the buildings have been destroyed or converted, the Greek-Cypriot citizens still want to be able to worship at these places to keep continuity with their faith without regard to the destruction. Aydin Dikmen considered a key suspect Aydin Dikmen is a 60-year-old man who has been arrested in relation to the looting and selling of looted goods from the island of Cyprus. He had been suspected of being involved in the selling of looted art since 1982, but he kept a low profile and fell off the radar for some time. His involvement was cemented when Peg Goldberg was sued by the Church of Cyprus in 1989 because she knew that she bought the mosaics from Dikmen; he claimed that he found the remains in the rubble of a church that had been forgotten and basically destroyed while he was working as an archaeologist in the northern part of Cyprus.Bourloyannis, M. Christiane, and Virginia Morris. 1992. ‚ÄúAutocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus v. Goldberg & Feldman Fine Arts, Inc‚Äù. The American Journal of International Law, 86 (1): 128-133. We also have documentation of another transaction where Dikmen worked with art collectors in the United States; Dominique de Menil, of the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas, bought two 13th-century frescoes from Dikmen on behalf of the Church of Cyprus in 1983. Those two previous cases are only two cases in which Dikmen‚Äôs presence has been suggested; he has been implicated in many more transactions, but those accusations have yet to be proven. However, in 1997, former colleagues of Dikmen helped the authorities arrest Dikmen and raid his many apartments. In these apartments, some of which Dikmen rented under false names and used as storage space, the authorities found a surplus of icons, frescoes, early Bibles, ancient pottery, statues, and coins from Cyprus. After learning of another residence of Dikmen‚Äôs, the authorities found 30 to 40 more crates filled with icons, frescoes, mosaics, and artifacts. Also in one of the residences, the authorities found drawings containing information on how to cut out mosaics to keep the faces of the religious figures intact, while still taking the piece away from the original space; this shows how systematic and planned out the looting of the churches and monasteries was for Dikmen and his associates in the northern part of Cyprus. The organization and the intense planning involved brings up the issue of possible aid coming from Turkish authorities in the northern part of Cyprus; there are rumors that the government and military knew about the looting and chose to not do anything about it. This discomforting idea is continually straining the ties between Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus. Since Dikmen‚Äôs arrest in 1998, the Antiphonitis frescoes and the Kanakarian mosaics have been returned to Cyprus, and soon the 13th-century frescoes currently housed by the Menil Collection in Houston will be returned to the island, as well.‚ÄúThe Menil Collection Celebrates Return of Byzantine Frescoes With Public Events Honoring Sacred Works‚Äù.

The search for the looted art of Cyprus continues, and there seems to be more and more evidence of Dikmen‚Äôs presence in other transactions of international looted art. Many think that Dikmen is just a middle man who is working on behalf of more knowledgeable and rich patrons, but the mystery is still not solved.

When the de Menil collection was granted temporary possession of the frescoes, they constructed a chapel to house the frescoes and keep them safe. This specially built chapel was designed by De Menil‚Äôs husband, Fran√ßois de Menil, who studied traditional Byzantine architecture and spatial arrangement from the original chapel at Lysi; the layout and the placement of the mosaics mirrors the arrangement from the original chapel.‚ÄúThe Byzantine Fresco Chapel: Architecture‚Äù.

The interior of the chapel has black walls which are illuminated to create a sense of vastness and infinity; the black walls help to focus the attention of the viewer on the frescoes and create a divine experience for the viewer.

The icon is thought to have been stolen around 1974, during the chaotic time of the Turkish invasion of the Northern part of Cyprus, and there is documentation to believe that the icon was once housed in The Church of St. Charalambos in Neo Chorio-Kythrea. O‚ÄôDowd was unaware that the icon had been stolen because he bought the artifact ‚Äúwith good faith‚Äù from an art dealer in 1985. The singer is glad that the piece is going back to its original home because he wants everyone to see it on display in its rightful place. However, it will not be going back to the original Church in the northern part of Cyprus; it is being held in Brussels, Belgium, and it will return to Cyprus at a later date when The Church of Cyprus has an appropriate space in which it can be stored. This case has contributed to the Church of Cyprus and their efforts to repatriate ‚Äústolen spiritual treasures‚Äù that have come from their homeland of Cyprus. =Peg Goldberg and the Kanakaria mosaics= This case study outlines the events that occurred in 1989 between Peg Goldberg, a local art dealer in Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg gained ‚Äúownership‚Äù and then tried to sell Cypriot mosaics from the 6th century. These mosaics have been looted from the Church of the Virgin of Kanakaria in the village of Lythrangomi in Northern Cyprus after surviving the 8th and 9th century. These mosaics had survived the 8th- and 9th-century iconoclasm in the Byzantine world and were considered to be finer than other mosaics, even the mosaics found in Ravenna, Italy and the mosaics in St. Catherine‚Äôs monastery in Sinai. The Kanakaria mosaics were cut into pieces when they were looted from the original church, and Peg Goldberg was able to purchase four segments of these early mosaics from Aydin Dikmen. These mosaics are important to the cultural, artistic, and religious heritage of Cyprus because they are some of the few remaining Byzantine mosaics from the island; when and how these mosaics were taken from Cyprus is unknown because there is documentation to show that they were still intact in 1976, two years after the initial invasion by the Turkish troops. These mosaics first came into the view of the Church of Cyprus when Goldberg approached the Getty Museum to purchase the mosaic pieces. The Getty Museum recognized them as the lost Kanakaria mosaics and informed Cyprus that they were in the United States. Shortly afterward, the Church of Cyprus filed a claim at the district court to try to reclaim the mosaics. The federal court in Indiana made a verdict in favor of the Church of Cyprus, and the mosaics were returned in 1991 to the Byzantine Museum in Nicosia, Cyprus. The verdict showed that Goldberg could not own the pieces because Dikmen had stolen the mosaics and had no right to pass on the ownership of the stolen mosaics. Goldberg stated that the pieces had been bought ‚Äúin good faith‚Äù from a ‚ÄúTurkish antiquities dealer‚Äù who found the mosaics in an abandoned church, but the judge ruled that not looking into the background and workings of the dealer was unacceptable because it was her responsibility to look into the people she was working with. This case called in the multilateral treaty of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export, and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property, which calls for all available parties to help recover and return items that have been requested by the country of origin; using this international decree helped to show the importance of these artifacts which needed to be sent to their home land of Cyprus. People have been happy with this verdict for the Kanakaria case because they want others to realize that cultural heritage of the world is not for sale, and hopefully discourage further selling of looted art in the international market.Honan, William H. ‚ÄúArt Dealer Told Again to Return Mosaics‚Äù. Arts. The New York Times. 26 Oct 1990. Web. 1 March 2012. < https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/26/arts/art-dealer-told-again-to-return- mosaics.html?emc=eta1>. The mosaic pieces that were involved in the Kanakaria case have four different religious images. They depict Jesus as a young boy, the archangel Michael, Matthew and James; the final two are images of apostles from the 1st century. The mosaics were named after the Church in which they were placed originally around 530. These mosaics have fallen into destruction because of the damage that they experienced through the process of removal from the church, shipping around the world, and during the restoration work that Goldberg commissioned. It is unlikely that these mosaics will ever be reinstalled in their original home, even if there are changes in the political situation on Cyprus, because they would most likely not make it through the re-installation process in the state that they are currently in.

In fact, about 95 percent of the museum's contents never left the museum. According to investigators of the thefts, about two percent of the museum pieces were stored elsewhere for safekeeping.

Paul Getty Museum have been repeatedly exposed as two of the world's biggest institutional recipients of looted and stolen Mediterranean artefacts, and the museums benefited from the illegal antiquities trade, both through direct acquisition, and via donations and bequests from major private collectors. A significant number of Met and Getty acquisitions over a period of at least 40 years were everntually shown to have been sourced from a major international illegal antiquities trading network that centred on Italian art dealer Giacomo Medici. From the late 1960s, Medici rose to become the central figure in a large criminal conspiracy, acting as the middleman between gangs of tombaroli (tomb robbers) - who systematically looted tens of thousands of important artefacts from Italian and other Mediterranean archaeological sites, as well as stealing objects from museums, churches and private collections - and an elite group of American and British dealers who helped Medici to \\"launder\\" his contraband and sell it to major buyers like the Met, the Getty and leading American private collectors. Medici typically paid the tombaroli small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled them out of Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer Robin Symes, Rome-based American dealer Robert E. Hecht, and Hollywood dealer and producer Bruce McNall. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the Carabinieri) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered tens of thousands of looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (organisational chart) that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed there ca. 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999. Euphronios krater, a 2,500-year-old Greek vase, stolen from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled from Italy, returned to Italy by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2006 In 2006, the Metropolitan Museum of Art finally agreed to relinquish ownership of a 2,500-year-old Greek vase known as the Euphronios krater, a krater painted by Euphronios, after the TPC was able to establish that the object had been looted from an Etruscan tomb and smuggled out of Italy by the Medici gang. The Met also surrendered 15 pieces of Sicilian silver and four ancient vessels in exchange for long-term loans of other antiquities. According to the New York Times, the case, \\"of its kind, perhaps second only to the dispute between Greece and Great Britain over the Elgin marbles,\\" \\"became emblematic of the ethical questions surrounding the acquisition of ancient art by major museums.\\"Randy Kennedy and Hugh Eakin. Met Sending Vase to Italy, Ending 30-Year Dispute. New York Times. February 2, 2006 The Metropolitan Museum has been involved in several other major controversies involving antiquities believed or proven to have been looted or stolen, including: * the Cloisters Cross, a large Romanesque cross carved from walrus ivory, said to have been carved in England, but possibly made in Germany. It was initially offered to the British Museum in 1961 by its then owner, a shady Yugoslav 'collector' called Ante Topiƒá Mimara, who is now widely believed to have acquired as part of a huge collection of art and antiquities that he stole at the end of WWII from the Central Collecting Point in Munich, the Allied clearinghouse for the repatriation of material looted by the Nazis. The British Museum eventually declined to buy the cross because Topiƒá Mimara would not provide proof that he had full title to the object, but immediately after the British Museum's option expired in 1963, the cross was purchased for the Met by curator Thomas Hoving for GBP¬£200,000. The Cross is currently still in the collection of the Met, at its Cloisters Museum annexe.Peter Watson; Cecilia Todeschini (2007), The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums (Public Affairs, NY), pp.133-146 * the Karun Treasure, also known as the Lydian Hoard, is a fabulous collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE. It formed part of a larger haul of some 450 objects that were looted by local tomb robbers from ancient four royal tombs near Sardis, in Turkey in 1966-67. The contents of the tombs, including painted pieces of the walls, were stripped and sold (via Swiss and American middlemen) to the Metropolitan Museum between 1966 and 1970 for a total of US$1.5 million, but they were kept hidden in storage for more than 20 years. The Treasure was eventually put on display in 1984 in a major exhibition, where it was seen by Turkish journalist √ñzgen Acar, who had been investigating the looting of the tombs for many years. Although the Met intentionally mislabeled the objects as part of an ‚ÄúEast Greek treasure,‚Äù Acar immediately recognised them as the Lydian artefacts, from the descriptions he had been given by the looters. He alerted the Turkish government, and in 1986, they officially requested the hoard be returned. The Met refused, so Turkey began legal action to recover it.The History Blog: \\"Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found\\" (posted 28 November 2012) After a six-year legal battle which reportedly cost the Turkish government UK¬£25 millionConstanze Letch, \\"King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey\\", The Guardian, 26 November 2012 the case ended dramatically after the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee revealed that a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects. The Met was forced to concede that staff had known the objects were stolen when it bought them, and the collection was repatriated to Turkey in 1993. * the Morgantina treasure, a 16-piece hoard of 3rd century BCE Roman silver, valued at US$100 million. Acquired in the early 1980s, it was later shown to have been looted from an important archaeological site in Morgantina, Sicily. After another protracted law suit, the Met was also forced to relinquish the treasure, and it was repatriated to Sicily in 2010. In an interview with Archaeology, a publication of the Archaeological Institute of America, investigative journalist Peter Watson wrote in June 2006 that according to the Italian public prosecutor Paolo Ferri, 100,000 tombs have been looted in Italy alone, representing a value of US$500 million. He estimates that the overall monetary value of looted art, including Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Cyprus, West Africa, Central America, Peru, and China, is at least four times the Italian figure.Exposing the Culture Thieves.

During its existence, the Khmer Empire was regularly raided by its neighbours, which resulted in its cultural heritage being distributed widely across the region.Briggs, Palmer. Ancient Khmer Empire The major historian of the Khmer Empire, Lawrence Palmer Briggs, regularly mentions these raids‚Äîfor example, the sack of Angkor in 1430‚Äì31 by the Siamese who carried off their loot to Ayutthaya,Briggs, Palmer. The Ancient Khmer Empire, p258 after which \\"people fled from the 'great and glorious capital' of Khmer civilisation as if it were ridden with plague\\".Briggs, Palmer. The Ancient Khmer Empire, p261 Consequently, the cultural heritage of the region was already widely spread by the time the French founded their protectorate in IndoChina in 1864. Briggs describes Preah Khan Kompong Svay as \\"shamefully looted\\" in the late 19th century by Louis Delaporte, \\"who carried the spoils away to French museums (thus beginning the systematic looting of Cambodian temples for the benefit of public and private collections of Europe and America)\\".Briggs, Palmer. The Ancient Khmer Empire, p 222 He also describes how French tourists well into the 20th century carried off many statues.Briggs, Palmer. The Ancient Khmer Empire, p77 Therefore, by the early 20th century it was rare to find Khmer objects in situ and local and foreign collectors, particularly in France, had built up collections of Khmer objects. Many objects from the region were exported to Europe and elsewhere and ended up in museums such as the Guimet. During the second world war, whilst France was occupied by Nazi Germany, the Indochina region was controlled variously by the Japanese, locally, and after the war, the French regained control. There followed a period of 35 years of disruption and warfare, including Dien Ben Phu and the Vietnam war. Thereafter Cambodia fell under the control of the notorious Khmer Rouge regime. Some objects left the country during that period, either to save them from destruction or for looting purposes. Reports have suggested that where objects have been moved, local officials and armed forces (both before and after the periods of turmoil) were responsible.see movie Angkor for Sale directed Adrian Maben 1997 In 1992, a report in The Christian Science Monitor described art experts' concerns about a \\"rampant degradation of archeological sites and an accelerating trade in stolen artifacts sweeping Southeast Asia\\" as a consequence of war in Cambodia and instability in the region.Tefft, Sheila. \\"Plundering of Artifacts Sweeps Asia\\", The Christian Science Monitor, 15 October 1992.

Statues were being stripped from Angkor Wat and other sites by smuggling rings often working in collusion with military and political officials, including a major network in Chiang Mai run by a former government minister. The British-born Thai-based collector Douglas Latchford says that when he and other collectors traversed Cambodia and Thailand in the 1960s, buying and trading Cambodian antiquities, they were not concerned about provenance, but regarded themselves as rescuers of artefacts that otherwise might have been neglected or destroyed.Mashberg, Tom, \\"Claims of Looting Shadow Expert in Khmer Art\\", The New York Times, 12 December 2012. Many of the objects they purchased were later donated or sold to museums. In the 2000s, evidence that the artefacts had been looted persuaded a number of major museums around the world to return the objects to Cambodia.\\"In 2012, Latchford was identified in [US] federal court records as a middleman in the trafficking of looted antiquities from Southeast Asia. Authorities allege Latchford knowingly purchased two looted Khmer sculptures from ‚Äúan organized looting network‚Äù and conspired with the London auction house Spink to obtain false export permits for them. The case was a civil lawsuit, and Latchford was not charged with a crime. But after a lengthy legal battle, Sotheby‚Äôs agreed to return its sculpture to Cambodia. Soon after, the Norton Simon Museum, Christie‚Äôs auction house and the Metropolitan Museum of Art all returned sculptures tied to Latchford.\\" Chasing Aphrodite: \\"The Kushan Buddhas: Nancy Wiener, Douglas Latchford and New Questions about Ancient Buddhas\\" (originally posted 1 February 2015) Among the objects sold or donated to major museums by Latchford are a number of rare ancient Khmer statues, reportedly looted from the temple site of Koh Ker in Cambodia, and at least two Indian seated Kushan Buddhas, looted from the ancient Indian city of Mathura. One of the seated Buddhas was originally offered‚Äîvia Manhattan dealer Nancy Wiener‚Äîto Canada's Royal Ontario Museum, but they ultimately declined to buy it, owing to its dubious provenance. In 2000 it was bought by the National Gallery of Australia, but subsequent investigations exposed the seated Buddha as a looted artwork, and it has since been repatriated to India.

The Polish Crown Jewels were removed by the Prussians in 1795 after the Third Partition of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the collapse of the November Uprising, literary and art treasures were removed from Poland. Poland regained some of the artefacts after the Treaty of Riga, comprising the furnishings of the Warsaw Castle and the Wawel Castle. During the Second World War, Germany tried to destroy Poland completely and exterminate its population as well as culture. Countless art objects were looted, as Germany systematically carried out a plan of looting prepared even before the start of hostilities (see also Nazi plunder). Twenty-five museums and many other facilities were destroyed. The total cost of German theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 20 billion dollars, or an estimated 43% of Polish cultural heritage; over 516,000 individual art pieces were looted (including 2,800 paintings by European painters; 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 1,400 sculptures, 75,000 manuscripts, 25,000 maps, 90,000 books including over 20,000 printed before 1800, and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value).

National Geographic News, March 11, 2004 Looting of Spain Peninsular War During Napoleon's invasion of Spain, Joseph I planned to host the best art of Spain in a museum, so he ordered to collect all possible art works. In 1810, 1000 paintings were looted in Seville by the French Army. Most paintings came from religious buildings. Over 180 paintings were stolen by Marshal Soult, including some of Murillo. El Escorial in Madrid also suffered from looting, were many precious artworks were amassed by the occupant army. When Joseph I was leaving Spain, he abandoned more than 200 paintings from the Spanish royal collection. Some of these paintings were gifted to the Duke of Wellington by Ferdinand VII. The best known looted piece is The Immaculate Conception of Los Venerables. It was looted by Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult in 1813 and taken to France. Later, in 1852, it was bought by the Louvre. Vichy Regime made an exchange of artwork with Spanish Government and returned to Spain. 20th century During the 1970s most of the looting was undetected and unpunished. There was no actual legislation that protected archaeological sites, nor there were enforcers of the law in that places. Since 1978, there has been a tremendous development in the framework of legal protection of cultural heritage. 21st century In the decade of the 2010s there has been several cases of looters with metal detectors in archaeological sites. Looting by perpetrator Looting by the British Empire The transformation of theft and plunder as an incentive for troops to institutionalized, indiscriminate looting following military conflict can be observed in the wake of British conquest in Asia, Africa and India. The looting of artifacts for \\"both personal and institutional reasons\\" became \\"increasingly important in the process of \\"othering\\" Oriental and African societies and was exemplified in the professionalism of exploration and the growth of ethnographic departments in museums, the new 'temples of Empire'.\\" Looting, not necessarily of art, became a vital instrument for the projection of power and the British imperial desire to gather and provide information about the \\"exotic\\" cultures and primitive tribes.Michael Carrington.

Looting by Napoleon Rembrandt's Descent from the Cross was looted in 1806 by French soldiers from the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, Germany; current location: Hermitage, St. Petersburg. Napoleon's conquests in Europe were followed by a systematic attempt, later more tentatively echoed by Hitler, to take the finest works of art of conquered nations back to the Louvre in Paris for a grand central museum of all Europe. Napoleon boasted: Many works were returned after his fall, but many others were not, and remain in France. Many works confiscated from religious institutions under the French occupation now form the backbone of national museums: \\"Napoleon's art-loot depots became the foundation of Venice's Accademia, Milan's Brera galleries.

One painting, The Return of the Prodigal Son, is now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington; a second looted painting, The Healing of the Paralytic, is in the National Gallery in London; only two of the original paintings have returned to Seville. Another French general looted several pictures, including four Claudes and Rembrandt's Descent from the Cross, from the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel in 1806. The stolen goods were later bought by the Empress Josephine and subsequently by the tsar. Ever since 1918, when Russia signed a peace treaty with Germany and Austria, have German negotiators demanded the return of the paintings.

Case studies A large number of institutions and museums have at various times been subject to both moral claims and legal claims concerning the provenance of their holdings subject to occasional review and challenge. One example of such a case study can be provided by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's reputation which has experienced a series of allegations and lawsuits about its status as an occasional institutional buyer of looted and stolen antiquities. Since the 1990s the Met has been the subject of numerous investigative reports and books critical of the Met's laissez-faire attitude to acquisition.Peter Watson, Cecilia Todeschini (2007), The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest MuseumsVernon Silver, The Lost Chalice: The Epic Hunt for a Priceless Masterpiece. Harper Collins Books, 2009. The Met has lost several major lawsuits, notably against the governments of Italy and Turkey, who successfully sought the repatriation of hundreds of ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern antiquities, with a total value in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In the late 1990s, long-running investigations by the Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale (TPC), the art crimes division of the Italian Carabinieri, accused the Metropolitan Museum of acquiring \\"black market\\" antiquities. TPC investigations in Italy revealed that many ancient Mediterranean objects acquired from the 1960s to the 1990s had been purchased, via a complex network of front companies and unscrupulous dealers, from the criminal gang led by Italian art dealer Giacomo Medici.\\" The Met is also one of many institutional buyers known to have acquired looted artifacts from a Thai-based British \\"collector\\", Douglas Latchford.\\"Chasing Aphrodite. \\"The Kushan Buddhas: Nancy Wiener, Douglas Latchford and New Questions about Ancient Buddhas\\" (originally posted 1 February 2015) In 2013, the Met announced that it would repatriate to Cambodia two ancient Khmer statues, known as \\"The Kneeling Attendants\\" , which it had acquired from Latchford (in fragments) in 1987 and 1992. A spokesperson for the Met stated that the museum had received \\"dispositive\\" evidence that the objects had been looted from Koh Ker and illegally exported to the USA.Jason Felch, \\"Metropolitan Museum says it will return Cambodian statues\\". Los Angeles Times, 3 May 2013 In addition to the ongoing investigations by the Italian police (TPC), lawsuits brought by the Governments of Italy, Turkey and Cambodia against the Metropolitan Museum of Art contend that the acquisition of the Euphronius krater may have demonstrated a pattern of less than rigorous investigation into the origin and legitimate provenance of highly desirable antiquities for the museum's collections. Examples include, the Cloisters Cross, a large Romanesque cross carved from walrus ivory, the Karun Treasure, also known as the Lydian Hoard, a collection of 200 gold, silver, bronze and earthenware objects, dating from the 7th Century BCE, and part of a larger haul of some 450 objects looted by local tomb robbers from four ancient royal tombs near Sardis, in Turkey in 1966‚Äì67.\\"Gold hippocampus from Lydian Hoard found\\". The History Blog, 28 November 2012 After a six-year legal battle that reportedly cost the Turkish government UK¬£25 million\\"King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey\\".Constanze Letch, The Guardian, 26 November 2012 the case ended dramatically after it was revealed that the minutes of the Met's own acquisition committee described how a curator had actually visited the looted burial mounds in Turkey to confirm the authenticity of the objects. The Met was forced to concede that staff had known the objects were stolen when it bought them, and the collection was repatriated to Turkey in 1993. The Morgantina treasure is a hoard of ornate Hellenistic silverware dated 3rd century BC, valued at perhaps up to US$100 million, acquired by the Met in the early 1980s. It was later shown to have been looted from the Morgantina archaeological site in Sicily. After a protracted lawsuit, the Met conceded that it was looted, and agreed in 2006 to repatriate it to Sicily, with the Met stating in 2006 that the repatriation \\"redresses past improprieties in the acquisitions process\\".Article, \\"Morgantina Silver\\", by Suzie Thomas, year 2012 at the website TraffickingCulture.org, website devoted to illicit trafficking in ancient art objects.

It is one stamp from the Americana series that were produced between 1975 and 1981. The $1 colonial rushlight holder stamp was first issued on July 2, 1979 and one pane of 100 stamps was issued with the dark brown (the last color printed, though it covers much of the stamp) inverted. The lamp candle holder, candle outline and text are inverted relative to the flame. About 95 copies have been accounted for. The Scott catalogue number is: 1610c. This was the first United States stamp issued with a major design element printed upside down since the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld invert error of 1962. As these $1 stamps were printed in sheets of 400, three additional panes of 100 stamps certainly existed at one time, but no trace of these has so far been discovered. When the one known pane of this invert was discovered, in the spring of 1986, it had already been on sale at the McLean, Virginia post office for some time without anyone noticing the error: indeed, five of its one hundred stamps had been sold by unsuspecting clerks, and the portion of the selvage bearing the plate number was no longer attached. In this incomplete form, the pane was purchased by an employee of the CIA, who had been sent to the post office to buy stamps for the agency. The purchaser failed at first to notice that the flames were inverted relative to the candle holder and lettering. Only several days later was the error discovered, by a CIA employee who needed a $1 stamp for an agency mailing. Once this man had shared his information with eight colleagues, the nine decided to acquire the error stamps for themselves. Purchasing 95 normal $1 stamps, the group exchanged these for the CIA‚Äôs inverts. They then revealed their find to an Annandale, Virginia, stamp dealer, Ike Snyder, who referred them to a New Jersey stamp specialist Jacques C. Schiff, Jr. Eventually the group struck a deal with Schiff. Each of the nine employees kept a single inverted stamp. Schiff paid a reported $25,000 for which he received a block of 85 inverts along with a single stamp that had been damaged. Initially, Schiff shielded the members of the group from scrutiny, announcing that the fourteen stamps from the sheet not sold to him had all been used on CIA mailings. However, after the true story surfaced in the mass media (revealed by the New York Times and CBS news), the stamp became known as the CIA invert, and the agency was obliged to make its own investigation. Ultimately the CIA demanded that the nine employees return their inverts to the agency, stating anyone who failed to comply would be terminated. Four returned their stamps and kept their jobs, four refused and were fired, while the ninth claimed that he had lost his stamp and remained a CIA employee. Stamp catalogs list its price as only $15,000, one-tenth of the Inverted Jenny that is valued at $150,000 despite the fact that about the same number of each stamp exist. A block of four stamps sold in 2004 for $60,000 and a second block was sold in 2015 for $71,875. Reproductions have been sold on eBay.

His debut came at Anfield as Liverpool drew 0‚Äì0 with Newcastle in a 1st Division match on 21 April 1930. His first goal came 10 months later on 7 February 1931, also against Newcastle: Wright scored a hat-trick in the 4‚Äì2 win, the goals coming in the 21st, 60th and 80th minutes. Wright was originally used as back-up for Jimmy Smith and because of this was called upon just 15 times in his first full season, even though during one of these appearances he scored a hat-trick. The following season was much better for Wright as he began the campaign by scoring 5 goals in the first 4 fixtures, he ended with 13 goals in his 35 starts. Wright followed this up with a 14-goal total during the 1932‚Äì33. Wright began as first choice at the beginning of the 1933‚Äì34 season starting in 9 of the first 10 games, he, however, lost his place to Syd Roberts and although Roberts couldn't hold on to the position it was Harold Taylor rather than Wright that got the nod.

Sally Go 'Round the Roses album The single's success led to the release of a Sally Go 'Round the Roses album on Tuff; besides the title cut, in both the vocal and instrumental versions, and the follow-up single \\"Keep an Eye on Her\\" \\"bubbled under the Hot 100\\" in November 1963. The album featured \\"Archie's Melody\\", \\"Bongo Bobby\\", \\"I Wanna Know\\", \\"No Love At All\\", \\"One Track Mind\\", \\"Pick Up My Marbles\\", \\"School Days\\" and \\"See Saw\\"; also featured as \\"A Special Guest Appearance\\" was \\"Dear Abby\\" credited to the Hearts, a minor hit (#94) recorded by at least some of the same personnel as \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\", and with the same \\"Sing Along without the...\\" instrumental-only version on the B-side. Despite the Jaynetts having been promoted as a quintet, their album cover image was of a trio, only two of whom‚ÄîEthel Davis and Lezli Valentine‚Äîare identifiable. Lezli is the lead voice on \\"Sally\\" and she performed the spoken part on \\"Dear Abby\\". JFK assassination In 1963, American Bandstand signed the Jaynetts to Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars national U.S. tour, which was scheduled to perform its 15th show on the night of November 22, 1963 at the Memorial Auditorium in Dallas, Texas, until suddenly the Friday evening event had to be cancelled, moments after U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated that afternoon while touring Dallas in an open car caravan. \\"A Rock n' Roll Historian - Caravan of Stars Fall 1963 Tour\\" \\"American Bandstand excerpt - Saturday, November 16, 1963\\" Follow-up The Jaynetts name was used for the release of two further singles on Tuff: \\"Snowman, Snowman Sweet Potato Nose\\" and \\"There's No Love at All\\" b/w \\"Tonight You Belong to Me\\". Throughout 1964 Tuff also released recordings featuring at least some of the personnel from \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\"; these releases were credited to the Clickettes (who were Lezli Valentine, Marlina Mars and Iggy Williams), the Poppies (not to be confused with the Poppies who recorded for Epic in 1966) and the Patty Cakes (whose release \\"I Understand Them\\" was subtitled \\"A Love Song to the Beatles\\"). In 1964 the Roulette single \\"Changing My Life for You\\" b/w \\"I Would If I Could\\", credited to the Z-Debs, was sung by members of the Jaynetts who had recorded \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\". The 1964 J&S; single \\"Cry Behind the Daisies\\" was the first release credited to the Jaynetts with a new core line- up retaining Johnnie Louise Richardson and adding Evangeline Jenkins, Linda Jenkins and Georgette Malone. This group had further J&S; releases into 1965 with \\"Chicken, Chicken, Crane or Crow\\" b/w \\"Winky Dinky\\", \\"Peepin' In and Out the Window\\" b/w \\"Extra Extra, Read All About It\\", \\"Who Stole the Cookie\\" b/w \\"That's My Baby\\", \\"Looking for Wonderland, My Lover\\" b/w \\"Make It an Extra\\" and \\"Vangie Don't You Cry\\" b/w \\"My Guy Is As Sweet As Can Be\\". Solo recordings Tuff Records released singles in 1964 credited to Vernell Hill (Ethel Davis) and Mary Sue Wellington (Mary Sue Wells: her name was adjusted to prevent confusion with Mary Wells). J&S; also released solo tracks by Ada Ray Kelly - billed as Ada \\"Cry Baby\\" Ray on the Zell's label in 1963 and 1964. Vernell Hill's Tuff single, \\"Long Haired Daddy\\", with songwriting credit by Abner Spector, was also released on Roulette in 1964. In 1968, Lezli Valentine recorded for All Platinum, a label formed the previous year in Englewood, New Jersey, by Sylvia Robinson, and recorded the original versions of The Moments' hits \\"Love on a Two Way Street\\", \\"I'm So Lost\\", \\"I Gotta Keep on Loving You\\" and \\"I Won't Do Anything\\". She also sang background on Eddie Kendricks' version of \\"Not on the Outside\\". In a 2000 interview for John Clemente's book Girl Groups: Fabulous Females That Rocked the World, Valentine revealed she had retired from the music industry, worked in Alcohol Beverage Control and had become a stenographer under then-New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Marie Hood went on to work for the Postal Service. From 1963 through 1966, Marlene Mack, as Marlina Mars, had singles released on Capitol, Okeh and MGM. Around 1970 she briefly partnered Herb Fame in Peaches and Herb's live shows, although the original Peaches, Francine Barker, still sang the female part on the duo's records. Louise Murray, who recorded solo for Verve in 1965, was reported to be performing in a duo with her husband Donald Gatling: they bill themselves as the Two Hearts, referencing the group with whom Murray had recorded \\"Lonely Nights\\" in 1954.Soulfulkindamusic.net At the Detroit Breakdown concert held 31 July 2010 at the Guggenheim Band Shell, Murray came onstage during the set by ? and the Mysterians to duet on \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\".

The first person to score in a Wembley final and the first player to be sold for ¬£10,000, Jack was already a legend by the time he took over as Middlesbrough manager in 1944. He made his debut against Fulham in the 1951-52 season, but struggled to establish himself at Ayresome Park and moved to Workington for a fee of ¬£5,000 in July 1953. He quickly established himself in the Workington defence, going on to make 262 league appearances before retiring in 1960. Coaching and managerial career On his retirement he became trainer at Workington, first under Joe Harvey and then under Ken Furphy. Furphy left to manager Watford in 1964 and Aitken followed him to Vicarage Road. He remained with Watford until 1971 when he left to become manager of Workington. In his first season in charge, Workington finished sixth in Division Four, but the club was in general decline and a 13th position finish the following season was followed by two successive bottom four finishes (and successful applications for re-election). Aitken left after the second of these in May 1974. He was assistant manager of Grimsby Town between 1975 and 1976 when he left to coach Brighton & Hove Albion.

He twice won gold medals at the chess Olympiads, for the best scores on his board. Anderson tied for the Canadian Chess Championship in 1953 and won this title outright in 1955.  Biography  Frank Anderson became very ill with childhood rheumatoid arthritis in Toronto, and learned to play chess while bedridden. Unable to exercise his body, he exercised his mind. He first played correspondence chess, becoming a strong player quite quickly. He was encouraged by chess promoter Bernard Freedman (who became his first sponsor), his good friend Keith Kerns and later by John G. Prentice, who served as Canada's representative to the FIDE, the World Chess Federation. Despite his physical disability, he graduated in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Toronto. His first noteworthy result was in the 1946 Canadian Championship in Toronto. Anderson scored 10/13 in the preliminaries, just missing qualification for the top section finals; he won section 2 of the finals.http://www.rogerpaige.me.uk/Tables2017.htm Anderson won the Toronto Championship six times (1947, 1948, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1958). In 1948, he tied for first place in the U.S. Junior Championship in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, with future Grandmaster Arthur Bisguier. He won the Ontario Open Championship in 1948, 1949, and 1951 (source: David Cohen's Canadian Chess site). He twice won Closed Canadian Chess Championships. In 1949, he tied for 3rd-4th, after Maurice Fox and Fedor Bohatirchuk, in Arvida (CAN-ch).1946 In 1951, he took 2nd, behind Povilas Vaitonis, in Vancouver (CAN-ch). In 1953, he tied for 1st with Daniel Yanofsky in Winnipeg (CAN-ch). In 1955, he won in Ottawa (CAN-ch). In 1957, he tied for 3rd-4th with Miervaldis Jursevskis, after Vaitonis and G√©za F√ºster, in Vancouver (CAN-ch)., the Frank Anderson player file Anderson played three times for Canada in Chess Olympiads (1954, 1958, 1964). He won the second-board gold medal at Amsterdam 1954, with a score of (+13 =2 -2), and repeated the feat at Munich 1958, with a score of (+9 =3 -1). At Tel Aviv 1964, he scored (+4 =3 -5) on second board (http://www.olimpbase.org). He came closer to the Grandmaster title than any other player, but became ill (reaction to an incorrect prescription), and was unable to play his final round in Munich. He missed the Grandmaster title because of this. Even if he had played and lost, he would have made the final norm necessary for the Grandmaster title. His Olympiad totals were (+26 =8 -8), for 71.4 per cent.OlimpBase :: the encyclopaedia of team chess Awarded the IM title in 1954, he became the first Canadian-born International Master. He lost a transatlantic cable game with Igor Bondarevsky played over four days in February 1954. He played at the Canadian Hobby and Homecraft Show.Toronto Star, Feb. 13, 1954. But Anderson won a return game when Bondarevsky visited Toronto a few months later in July 1954.Toronto Star, July 6, 1954 Anderson scored 7/10 in the 1956 Canadian Open Chess Championship in Montreal for a shared 8-12th place, drawing his game in the last round with 13-year-old Bobby Fischer.The Chess Games of Robert J. Fischer, edited by Robert Wade and Kevin O'Connell, Batsford 1972, p.105 He wrote a weekly chess column for The Hamilton Spectator, 1955‚Äì1964, and was co-author (along with Keith Kerns) of the tournament book of the Fourth Biennial World Junior Chess Championship, Toronto 1957. In this book, he came up with a small innovation, writing the moves in descriptive notation with no '-'; that is, he wrote PK4 instead of the normal P-K4 (see Descriptive chess notation). He was a computer expert, and played with a computer chess program in 1958.Toronto Star, Mar 2, 1959. He moved to California after the 1964 Olympiad, where he lived with his wife Sylvia, settling in San Diego, where he operated a tax consulting business. He was inducted into the Canadian Chess Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2009, American International Master John Donaldson wrote a biography and games collection The Life and Games of Frank Anderson.  Style His style was precise and positional, with an emphasis on the endgame, but he could also create clever tactics. He favored 1.e4 as White, usually the Ruy Lopez. He liked knights over bishops. Famous games Three of his wins over Grandmasters, shown below, with the moves given in algebraic notation.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation from 1984 to 1994. Manley was born in Washington Heights, Manhattan and grew up watching wrestling at Madison Square Garden. Professional wrestling career  Early career (1984‚Äì1987)  Powers was discovered and brought into the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1984 by Big John Studd who also had a hand in training him. In 1985, Powers ventured outside the WWF to gain more experience, including two Texas based promotions: Texas All-Star Wrestling and World Class Championship Wrestling where he appeared at a couple of the federation‚Äôs featured \\"Star Wars\\" events. After gaining more experience, Powers returned to the WWF. World Wrestling Federation  Young Stallions (1987‚Äì1989) He arguably reached the peak of his career in the WWF when Powers, on March 11, 1987, along with another preliminary wrestler Paul Roma, formed a tag team called The Young Stallions. At first the team had no name, and the original pairing saw Roma and Powers teamed with Tito Santana in a six-man tag team match against the team of Don Muraco, Bob Orton, Jr., and Tiger Chung Lee on Wrestling Challenge. The team of Powers, Roma, and Santana were victorious when Santana pinned Lee, after Muraco and Orton walked away from the match. Following the win, the team lost twice to Demolition, as well as an eight-man tag team match against members of The Heenan Family in June 1987. Powers and Roma finally gained their first televised victory in regular tag team action in late July 1987 when they faced another preliminary team, Barry Horowitz and Steve Lombardi. The team was dominant and announcer Bobby Heenan was stunned when Roma unleashed an off the top rope sunset flip. Fresh off of their first win, Powers and Roma were scheduled to face The Hart Foundation on an August 8, 1987 episode of Superstars (taped August 4), they scored an upset disqualification victory over WWF Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation. The team received their name by accident when color commentator Bruno Sammartino referred to them once as \\"a couple of young stallions\\" thus naming the team. In October 1987 the Young Stallions became the official moniker of the Powers and Roma tag team. A storyline playing off of their upset win over the Hart Foundation was started as they \\"stole\\" the theme song \\"Crank It Up\\" from Jimmy Hart, who had intended to use it for his team. Later that month they faced The Hart Foundation in a rematch on Saturday Night's Main Event XII. The Stallions were narrowly defeated and now clearly had momentum. Along with The Killer Bees, they were also the only survivors in the elimination tag team match at the first annual Survivor Series pay-per-view on November 26, 1987. On December 26, 1987 the Stallions were scheduled to face The Hart Foundation in Buffalo, NY. Neidhart did not appear at the event, and the match was then switched to a singles match between Powers and Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart. That night Powers scored perhaps the greatest upset of his career to date when he pinned the future WWF World Champion. Following the match, Hart complained that the loss was a fluke and volunteered to take on Paul Roma. Another match followed, and Roma also pinned Hart.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm That momentum however seemed to end in January 1988 when the Stallions faced The Islanders in a best two out of three falls match in the final bout of the inaugural Royal Rumble. Powers and Roma were defeated cleanly in two straight falls. The team was placed in featured matches on television and at house shows, but most times ended up on the losing end to teams such as The Bolsheviks, The Brain Busters, and The Fabulous Rougeaus. Following yet another loss, this time to Demolition on the March 19, 1989 episode of Wrestling Challenge, the team began arguing after the match. Their final televised match was a loss to The Powers of Pain in July 1989. Soon, they were split up off camera without an official announcement. Roma and Powers went their separate ways and both floundered on the undercard afterward, with Powers sustaining an injury that forced him out of action until March 1990. Roma and Powers feuded for a while during this period, but this soon was scrapped, and they both returned to competing in singles matches. Singles competition (1989‚Äì1994)  As Roma began teaming with Hercules to form the team of Power and Glory that spring, Powers began to occasionally partner with Jim Brunzell. Powers had an opportunity to face his former partner in the August 1990 episode of Prime Time Wrestling when Power and Glory defeated Powers and Brunzell. On house shows, Roma faced off against Powers in singles competition multiple times during that month as well, with Roma coming out victorious at every outcome. For the next four years Powers was featured primarily as a singles wrestler. During this time, he most notably became the first WWF wrestler to lose to Ric Flair when the \\"Nature Boy\\" made his Federation debut on the September 30, 1991 episode of Prime Time Wrestling. While sustaining televised losses to top stars like Mr. Perfect, Ted DiBiase, The Undertaker, Powers also defeated Al Perez, Steve Lombardi, and The Predator. In 1991, Powers teamed with a variety of partners, with such wrestlers as Marty Jannetty, and Owen Hart, in both house Shows, and televised shows. Probably his peak push came in June 1992, when he returned after a several month hiatus from television to pin Lombardi and Bob Bradley. He followed this up with numerous house show victories, and closed 1992 with a Wrestling Challenge victory against Brian Lee in October. From this point on however he was unable to move up the card, although he narrowly lost to Jerry Lawler in April 1993 on WWF Monday Night Raw and defeated Repo Man on house shows. Powers also defeated The Tazmaniac on a house show on June 30, 1993 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He ended 1993 with a victory over Papa Shango at a house show on July 23 in Syracuse New York. After a five-month hiatus he returned to the roster, wrestling primarily on house shows against Rick Martel and Kwang. His final television appearances came in July 1994, when he faced Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett on WWF Superstars and Wrestling Challenge. Powers ended his WWF career on a winning streak, defeating Abe Schwartz at Madison Square Garden on October 29 and again in Scranton, Pennsylvania the following night. He then departed, a full decade after first signing with the company.  American Wrestling Federation (1994)  In 1994, Powers competed for the short lived American Wrestling Federation (AWF) on the TV series Warriors of Wrestling where he was a fan favorite. He also teamed with Johnny Gunn while in the AWF. During all of their AWF tag matches, Powers and Gunn would struggle until Powers lowered his singlet straps to reveal his finely chiseled torso. In apparent awe, the opposing team would instantly wither and Powers and Gunn would quickly secure a pin. Unlike his WWF run, however, Powers had a more successful run as a whole in the AWF, most of the time coming out victorious, even wrestling enhancement talent alongside his tag-team partner Gunn. Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994) On the November 22, 1994 episode of ECW Hardcore TV, Powers unsuccessfully challenged ECW World Heavyweight Champion Shane Douglas for the title. He would defeat Ray Odyssey at the same event however.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=2380&page;=4 Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling (1995)  On June 1, 1995, Powers made his first appearance for the independent wrestling promotion Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling. He teamed with Jimmy B. Good in a losing effort against Assault And Battery (Jimmy Deo & Maxx Crimson). A month later on July 20 at the Silo Nightclub in Reading, PA, he competed against former nemesis Jeff Jarrett for the vacated PCW Americas Championship. The match was even more notable in that Jarrett was still an active competitor for the World Wrestling Federation, although he would leave the promotion three days afterwards. Former WWE executive Bruce Prichard said that Jarrett had been loaned to the PCW as a favor to its owner.http://www.mlwradio.com/something- to-wrestle-with-bruce-prichard.html Jarrett defeated Powers for the title. Two days later Jim Powers would return the favor, gaining the PCW Americas championship after defeating Jarrett on July 22 in Wind Gap, PA.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=5&nr;=954 World Championship Wrestling (1996‚Äì1998)  Powers joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), making his initial appearance on the June 10, 1996 WCW Monday Nitro in Wheeling, West Virginia in a match against Diamond Dallas Page. Six days later he appeared in the live pre-show for the Great American Bash, which aired on Main Event, this time losing to VK Wallstreet. On July 7, 1996 he picked up his first WCW victory, pinning Hugh Morrus in a dark match at the Bash at the Beach.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw96.htm The following night, Powers faced Ric Flair in a rematch of their encounter in 1991. He was scouted and then managed for a brief time by Teddy Long as well as being scheduled to form a mid-card stable with ‚ÄúDesperado\\" Joe Gomez and The Renegade but nothing ever came of it. He was attacked and spray painted during a mid-1996 match by the emerging New World Order (nWo). Powers also teamed briefly with Bobby Walker, and they also were managed by Teddy Long. On July 22, the Teddy Long stable of Powers, Gomez, Renegade, and Alex Wright defeated The Dungeon of Doom quartet of Kevin Sullivan, The Leprechaun (Buddy Lee Parker), Hugh Morrus, and The Barbarian. In September 1996 he began to acquire several wins, defeating Mr JL, Juventud Guerrera, and Disco Inferno. He defeated Pat Tanaka in the dark match of Halloween Havoc 1996 on October 27. The following night he earned a shot against Dean Malenko for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship on Monday Nitro, but was not successful. A month later he was one of the sixty competitors in the annual World War 3 pay-per-view in 1996. Still managed by Teddy Long, Powers entered 1997 by facing Hugh Morrus on the January 6th episode of Monday Nitro in Monroe, LA, but was defeated.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw97.htm Shortly afterwards Long's stable fractured, with Joe Gomez and Renegade departing. Teaming with Bobby Walker, Powers would face Gomez and Renegade twice during the start of the year in matches shown on WCW Saturday Night and WCW Pro. Both times they were victorious. On March 4, 1997 the duo of Powers and Walker faced Harlem Heat on WCW Saturday Night, but were unsuccessful. On May 3, Powers and Walker face The Armstrong Brothers (Scott Armstrong and Steve Armstrong) on WCW Pro, and again fell in defeat. Powers would face Lex Luger, The Barbarian, Curt Hennig, and others in singles competition during the year, but was winless. On the January 3rd, 1998 edition of WCW Worldwide the duo of Powers and Walker made their first appearance together in seven months. Still managed by Teddy Long, they fell to Steve Regal and \\"Squire\\" Dave Taylor. Later that day they would appear on the final episode of WCW Main Event ever, defeating Johnny Swinger and Casey Tompson. This would be the last teaming of the two, and shortly thereafter Teddy Long's stable dissolved.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw98.htm Now a singles wrestler, Powers then earned his first individual victory in over a year when he defeated Horshu on the February 17th episode of WCW Saturday Night. He would later face Bill Goldberg, Scott Norton, and Fit Finlay. His last appearance came on the August 31st episode of Monday Nitro where he competed against Wrath. During his time in WCW he sustained a neck injury which ultimately led to his departure from the company.https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/dont-call-me-a-jobber- former-stallion-jim-powers-remains-forever-young-20150204 Retirement (1998‚Äì2007)  Powers spent close to a decade retired, rehabbing a neck injury.  Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2010)  Jim Powers returned to wrestling for an independent promoter on March 9, 2007. Since returning to wrestling, Powers has wrestled for several independent based organizations and has appeared, pairing back up with Young Stallions partner Paul Roma, at several wrestling fan fests meeting his fans and signing their autographs. In 2007, Powers was contacted by WWE to be a part of their developmental territory and train wrestlers there. Despite meeting face-to-face with WWE booker, John Laurinaitis, Powers never received a contract with the promotion. Powers said in recent interviews that he almost left his then-current job to work with the WWE, and also said Laurinaitis told him there weren't any places available in the developmental territories, but would call him if there was one. Powers said Laurinaitis repeated this so many times he didn't believe him anymore. On November 15, 2008 he defeated Johnny LeDoux at FCW Broken Bones 2008. He then embarked on the Wrestling Legends Tour 2009, facing Joe E. Legend and Tatanka in March 2009. After a fourteen-year absence (he had appeared on several shows in 1995), Powers rejoined NWA New Jersey. Teaming with Danny Inferno as the tag-team Fire Power, the duo defeated The Spirit Squad (Kenny Dykstra and Mike Mondo) to win the NWA New Jersey Tag-Team Championship. Powers final appearances came at \\"IWF Winter Warfare\\" for the Independent Wrestling Federation. His last match saw him team with Chachi to defeat Chris Steeler & Damian Adams on January 23, 2010 in West Paterson, New Jersey.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=47428 Retirement (2010‚Äìpresent)  On February 3, 2010, Powers announced his retirement. In 2012, Powers was hospitalized, and had two hip surgeries. In July 2016, Manley was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018. Powers has been a resident of East Rutherford, New Jersey.Herzog, Kenny. \\"Don't Call Me a Jobber: Former Stallion Jim Powers Remains Forever Young; Meet another of pro wrestling's preeminent \\"enhancement talents,\\" a man who rode with Paul Roma (and was almost managed by Mr. T)\\", Rolling Stone (magazine), February 4, 2015.

They are considered part of the founding trinity of Spanish-language rock in Argentina, along with Almendra and Manal. The unexpected success of their 1967 debut single \\"La balsa\\" was the kickstarter of Argentine rock, and pioneered Spanish-language rock.  History The group was started in the wake of an earlier band Los Gatos Salvajes, who had shared two the same members, in 1967. They recorded their first two singles \\"Ayer Nom√°s\\" and A-side \\"La Balsa\\", which turned into an unpredicted large scale hit in the Argentine winter of 67, selling over 200,000 copies, leading to their full-length debut later that year. The following year they went on tour around the Southern Cone, and then released their 3rd album Seremos Amigos, permeating psychedelic rock during the height of that subgenre of rock.Los Gatos Biograf√≠as de Grupos de Latinoam√©rica Parte 3 (Spanish) The band's next effort after a short break-up, 1969's Beat N¬∞1, featured the addition to the group of Pappo. His rocking blues style with Litto Nebbia's more classical melodic approach at times made the album uneven, but also created quite dazzling passages of music that can be considered one of the earliest recordings of progressive rock anywhere in the world, previewing the rise of the genre around the world in the 1970s. In 1970, Los Gatos released their final major album. Originally called Rock de la mujer podrida (literally \\"Rotten woman's rock\\"), the band was forced to change the name of the release by government censorship to Rock de la mujer perdida (\\"Lost woman's rock\\").Los Gatos www.rock.com.ar (Spanish) A harder rocking album with Pappo's fingerprints all over, it would be Los Gatos's last. Later that year Pappo left the band to form his own heavy blues-rock group Pappo's Blues. Los Gatos disbanded after a last batch of concerts, with Litto Nebbia kicking off his solo career.

It provides inpatient psychiatric care for the population of the West of the City. It used to house the regional adolescent psychiatric unit but this has recently moved to a new psychiatric unit at Stobhill Hospital. The Hospital is a venue used by the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland. Some parts of the hospital are classified as a category A building and are also deemed at risk. History A Committee of Management for the hospital was formed in 1804 and construction began in the Cowcaddens area of Glasgow in 1810. It was originally opened as the Glasgow Lunatic Asylum in 1814, but after a royal charter was obtained, it became the Glasgow Royal Lunatic Asylum in 1824. In the 1830s it was decided to commission a new hospital in the Gartnavel area of Glasgow. The new facility, which was designed by Charles Wilson in the Gothic Revival style, allowed segregation by patients' gender and social class. The new hospital opened in 1843. The hospital first published the Gartnavel Minstrel, the earliest example of a publication written and edited by hospital patients, in 1845. The facility became the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital in 1931 and, after major additions in 1939 and 1959, it became the Gartnavel Royal Hospital in 1963. Prominent clinicians who worked at the hospital included Sir David Henderson, who was physician-superintendent at the hospital from 1921 to 1932, Donald Ewen Cameron, who worked at the hospital during the 1920s and R. D. Laing, who worked at the hospital for a number of years during the 1950s. New Gartnavel Royal entrance The Gartnavel General Hospital opened on the same site in December 1972. A programme of modernisation at the Gartnavel Royal Hospital was completed in 2007, enabling the 117-bed hospital building to serve a significant population of Glaswegian inpatients, along with mental health facilities at Stobhill Hospital and Parkhead Hospital. The modernisation cost ¬£19 million and was said to be \\"the most modern and innovative building of its kind in the UK\\" at the time of opening. The 117-bed facility entirely comprised individual rooms, each with its own en-suite bathroom facilities. A community cafe and family room were also created in the hospital. Services The hospital houses a series separate wards located throughout the hospital grounds. The McNair House, Rutherford House and Henderson House wards provide care and treatment for individuals from 16‚Äì65 years of age who are experiencing any of a wide range of mental health difficulties of a severe and/or long-term nature. Cuthbertson House is a critical entry and assessment ward for people whose mental illness has been caused by a brain impairment, also known as organic mental illness ‚Äì \\"this type of illness is usually caused by disease affecting the brain. Dementia such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is an example of organic illnesses\\". Timbury House is a ward for patients older than 65 who suffer from a functional mental illness ‚Äì \\"this type of illness has a predominantly psychological cause. It may include conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, mood disorders or anxiety.\\" Controversy Joseph Doherty Incident On 8 October 1998, an enquiry was held on behalf of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland on the death of Joseph Doherty. In 1992 Doherty killed himself with a fatal leap from Erskine Bridge, after telling hospital staff he was going for a walk. This was the eighth incident of suicide between 1985 and 1992, including Joseph Gilmartin who was killed by a bus, a woman found dead after being discharged from the hospital and a woman who strangled herself within the hospital. Doherty suffered from schizophrenia. Doherty was a patient of the Gartnavel Royal Hospital at the time and his family filed a complaint with the hospital. However the investigators reported that they could not make the inquiry results available to Doherty's family. Six years later, during the inquiry, the family were given the outcome of the investigation but not the evidence, with the explanation that the Mental Health (Scotland) Act of 1984 did not allow the Commission to share the information publicly. When the law changed to allow sharing of the report with the complainant as well as with official bodies, Doherty's family were finally allowed this information. Kenneth Pitt Incident On 26 July 2006, an inquiry was held on the death of Kenneth Pitt, a patient at Gartnavel Royal Hospital who died at the Western Infirmary. Pitt suffered from psychotic symptoms requiring anti-psychotics and allegedly may have had Asperger syndrome. Pitt was a patient of the hospital between 1995 and 1997; hospital staff prescribed him various drugs to treat his symptoms. However, Pitt and his parents believed that he should have been prescribed anti-depressants and were opposed to him being forced to take the medication. Kenneth Pitt's father, Hugh Pitt, brought forward evidence about excessive temperatures in the rooms, inadequate treatment and poor hygiene at the hospital. Samuel Cathcart, Sheriff at the hearing, commented that these issues \\"are not, however, matters which, in my view, have a direct bearing on Kenneth's death...\\" It was ultimately determined that Kenneth Pitt‚Äôs death was not able to be prevented.

The product is also known as glassfibre reinforced concrete or GRC in British English. Glass fiber concretes are mainly used in exterior building fa√ßade panels and as architectural precast concrete. Somewhat similar materials are fiber cement siding and cement boards. Composition Glass fiber-reinforced concrete consists of high-strength, alkali-resistant glass fiber embedded in a concrete matrix. In this form, both fibers and matrix retain their physical and chemical identities, while offering a synergistic combination of properties that cannot be achieved with either of the components acting alone. In general, fibers are the principal load-carrying members, while the surrounding matrix keeps them in the desired locations and orientation, acting as a load transfer medium between the fibers and protecting them from environmental damage. The fibers provide reinforcement for the matrix and other useful functions in fiber-reinforced composite materials. Glass fibers can be incorporated into a matrix either in continuous or discontinuous (chopped) lengths. Durability was poor with the original type of glass fibers since the alkalinity of cement reacts with its silica. In the 1970s alkali- resistant glass fibers were commercialized. Alkali resistance is achieved by adding zirconia to the glass. The higher the zirconia content the better the resistance to alkali attack. AR glass fibers should have a Zirconia content of more than 16% to be in compliance with internationally recognized specifications (EN, ASTM, PCI, GRCA, etc). Laminates A widely used application for fiber-reinforced concrete is structural laminate, obtained by adhering and consolidating thin layers of fibers and matrix into the desired thickness. The fiber orientation in each layer as well as the stacking sequence of various layers can be controlled to generate a wide range of physical and mechanical properties for the composite laminate. GFRC cast without steel framing is commonly used for purely decorative applications such as window trims, decorative columns, exterior friezes, or limestone-like wall panels. Properties The design of glass-fiber-reinforced concrete panels uses a knowledge of its basic properties under tensile, compressive, bending and shear forces, coupled with estimates of behavior under secondary loading effects such as creep, thermal response and moisture movement. There are a number of differences between structural metal and fiber-reinforced composites. For example, metals in general exhibit yielding and plastic deformation, whereas most fiber-reinforced composites are elastic in their tensile stress-strain characteristics. However, the dissimilar nature of these materials provides mechanisms for high-energy absorption on a microscopic scale comparable to the yielding process. Depending on the type and severity of external loads, a composite laminate may exhibit gradual deterioration in properties but usually does not fail in a catastrophic manner. Mechanisms of damage development and growth in metal and composite structure are also quite different. Other important characteristics of many fiber-reinforced composites are their non-corroding behavior, high damping capacity and low coefficients of thermal expansion. Glass-fiber-reinforced concrete architectural panels have the general appearance of pre-cast concrete panels, but differ in several significant ways. For example, the GFRC panels, on average, weigh substantially less than pre-cast concrete panels due to their reduced thickness. Their low weight decreases loads superimposed on the building‚Äôs structural components making construction of the building frame more economical. Sandwich panels A sandwich panel is a composite of three or more materials bonded together to form a structural panel. It takes advantage of the shear strength of a low density core material and the high compressive and tensile strengths of the GFRC facing to obtain high strength-to-weight ratios. Public Library Lope de Vega in Tres Cantos, Madrid The theory of sandwich panels and functions of the individual components may be described by making an analogy to an I-beam. The core in a sandwich panel is comparable to the web of an I-beam, which supports the flanges and allows them to act as a unit. The web of the I-beam and the core of the sandwich panels carry the beam shear stresses. The core in a sandwich panel differs from the web of an I-beam in that it maintains a continuous support for the facings, allowing the facings to be worked up to or above their yield strength without crimping or buckling. Obviously, the bonds between the core and facings must be capable of transmitting shear loads between these two components, thus making the entire structure an integral unit. The load-carrying capacity of a sandwich panel can be increased dramatically by introducing light steel framing. Light steel stud framing is similar to conventional steel stud framing for walls, except that the frame is encased in a concrete product. Here, the sides of the steel frame are covered with two or more layers of GFRC, depending on the type and magnitude of external loads. The strong and rigid GFRC provides full lateral support on both sides of the studs, preventing them from twisting and buckling laterally. The resulting panel is lightweight in comparison with traditionally reinforced concrete, yet is strong and durable and can be easily handled.

He was the son of the king of Lochlann, identified in the non-contemporary Fragmentary Annals of Ireland as Gofraid, and brother of Auisle and √çmar, the latter of whom founded the U√≠ √çmair dynasty, and whose descendants would go on to dominate the Irish Sea region for several centuries. Another Viking leader, Halfdan Ragnarsson, is considered by some scholars to be another brother. The Irish Annals title Amla√≠b, √çmar and Auisle \\"kings of the foreigners\\". Modern scholars use the title \\"kings of Dublin\\" after the Viking settlement which formed the base of their power. The epithet \\"Conung\\" is derived from the Old Norse konungr and simply means \\"king\\".√ì Corrain, p. 2 Some scholars consider Amla√≠b to be identical to Olaf the White, a Viking sea-king who features in the Landn√°mab√≥k and other Icelandic sagas. During the late 850s and early 860s Amla√≠b was involved in a protracted conflict with M√°el Sechnaill, overking of the Southern U√≠ N√©ill and the most powerful ruler in Ireland. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, but it may have been sparked by competition for control of Munster and its resources. Amla√≠b allied successively with Cerball, King of Ossory and √Åed Findliath, overking of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill against M√°el Sechnaill. M√°el Sechnaill died in 862 and his lands were split, effectively ending the conflict. Following this Amla√≠b and his kin warred with several Irish leaders in an attempt to expand their kingdom's influence. In later years Amla√≠b conducted extensive raids in Scotland, though these were interrupted by a war in 868 against his former ally √Åed Findliath when several Viking longphorts along the northern coast were razed. Amla√≠b disappears from contemporary annals in 871. Later accounts say he returned to Lochlann to aid his father in a war, and the Pictish Chronicle says he died in battle against Constantine I of Scotland. This event is usually dated to 874. Background The earliest recorded Viking raids in Ireland occurred in 795.√ì Corrain, p. 27; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 795 Over time, these raids increased in intensity, and they overwintered in Ireland for the first time in 840-841.√ì Corrain, p. 28; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 840 Later in 841 a longphort was constructed at √Åth Cliath (Irish for hurdled ford), a site which would later develop into the city of Dublin.Holman, p. 180 Longphorts were also established at other sites around Ireland, some of which developed into larger Viking settlements over time. The Viking population in Ireland was boosted in 851 with the arrival of a large group known as \\"dark foreigners\\" ‚Äì a contentious term usually considered to mean the newly arrived Vikings, as opposed to the \\"fair foreigners\\", i.e., the Viking population which was resident in arrival prior to this influx.Downham, p. 14 A kingdom in Viking Scotland was established by the mid ninth-century, and it exerted control over some of the Vikings in Ireland. By 853 a separate kingdom of Dublin had been set up which claimed control over all the Vikings in Ireland.√ì Corrain, p. 28-29 Biography Ireland circa 900; the Viking settlements of Linns, Dublin, Wexford, Waterford, Cork and Limerick are marked Arrival in Ireland The earliest mention of Amla√≠b Conung is in the Annals of Ulster, which in 853 describe his arrival in Ireland: Amla√≠b is named in the annals as a \\"king of the foreigners\\", but in modern texts he is usually labelled the first king of Dublin, after the Viking settlement which was the base of his power.Holman, p. 107; Clarke et al., p. 62; √ì Corrain, p. 28-29 His brothers arrived in Ireland later and ruled together as co- kings.Woolf, p. 108 The Fragmentary Annals go into more detail regarding Amla√≠b's arrival: Lochlann, originally Laithlinn or Lothlend, the land where Amla√≠b's father was king, is often identified with Norway, but it is not universally accepted that it had such a meaning in early times.√ì Corrain, p. 9 Several historians have proposed instead that in early times, and certainly as late as the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, Laithlinn refers to the Norse and Norse-Gael lands in the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, the Northern Isles and parts of mainland Scotland.√ì Corrain, pp. 14-21; Helle, p. 204 Whatever the original sense, by the twelfth century, when Magnus Barefoot undertook his expedition to the West, it had come to mean Norway.√ì Corrain, pp. 22-24 War with M√°el Sechnaill If he did indeed leave Ireland, Amla√≠b had returned by 857 at the latest when he and √çmar fought against M√°el Sechnaill, overking of the Southern U√≠ N√©ill, and a group of Vikings sometimes known as the Norse- Irish. M√°el Sechnaill was the most powerful king in Ireland at the time and his lands lay close to the Viking settlement of Dublin.Downham, p. 17 The fighting began in the previous year: \\"Great warfare between the heathens and Mael Sechnaill, supported by Norse-Irish\\" is reported by the Annals of Ulster.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 856; √ì Corrain, p. 30 The fighting was focused on Munster; M√°el Sechnaill sought to increase his influence over the kings there. He took hostages from the province in 854, 856 and 858,Annals of the Four Masters, s.aa. 854, 856, 858; Annals of Ulster, s.aa. 854, 856, 858; Choronicon Scotorum, s.aa. 854, 856, 858 and the power of the over-kings had been weakened in 856 by a Viking raid on the royal centre at Lough Cend, when Gorm√°n son of Lon√°n, a relative of Munster's over-king, was killed alongside a great many others.Downham, p. 17; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 856; Choronicon Scotorum, s.a. 856 This weakness likely drew the gaze of both M√°el Sechnaill and the Vikings, and their competition for Munster's resources may have been the cause of the war. Early battles seem to have gone the way of the Vikings: Amla√≠b and √çmar \\"inflicted a rout on Caitill the Fair and his Norse-Irish in the lands of Munster\\".Annals of Ulster, s.a. 857 Although there is no certain evidence to suggest that this Caitill is the same person as the Ketill Flatnose of later sagas, Anderson and Crawford have suggested that they are the same person.Anderson, p. 286, note 1; Crawford, p. 47 In 858 √çmar, allied with Cerball, King of Ossory, routed a force of Norse-Irish at Araid T√≠re (east of Lough Derg and the Shannon in modern-day County Tipperary).√ì Corrain, p. 30; Downham, p. 18; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 858; Choronicon Scotorum, s.a. 858 Ossory was a small kingdom wedged between the larger realms of Munster and Leinster. At the beginning of his reign in the 840s, Cerball's allegiance was pledged to the over-king of Munster, but as that kingdom grew weaker Ossory's strategic location allowed opportunities for his advancement.Duffy, p. 122 Cerball had previously fought against the Vikings, but he allied with them to challenge the supremacy of M√°el Sechnaill and his Norse-Irish allies.Duffy, p. 122; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 847 The following year Amla√≠b, √çmar and Cerball conducted a raid on M√°el Sechnaill's heartlands in Meath, and in consequence a royal conference was held at Rathugh (modern- day County Westmeath).Downham, p. 19; Duffy, p. 122; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 859; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 859; Choronicon Scotorum, s.a. 859 Following this meeting Cerball shed his allegiance to the Vikings and formally submitted to M√°el Sechnaill in order to \\"make peace and amity between the men of Ireland\\".Annals of Ulster, s.a. 859 With their ally turned against them, Amla√≠b and √çmar sought a new alliance with √Åed Findliath, overking of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, and rival of M√°el Sechnaill.Downham, p. 19 In 860 M√°el Sechnaill and Cerball led a large army of men from Munster, Leinster, Connacht and the Southern U√≠ N√©ill into the lands of √Åed Findliath near Armagh. While the southern forces were encamped there, √Åed launched a night attack, killing some of the southern men, but his forces took many casualties and were forced to retreat.Downham, p. 19; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 860; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 860; Choronicon Scotorum, s.a. 860; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 279 In retaliation for this invasion Amla√≠b and √Åed led raids into Meath in 861 and 862, but they were driven off both times.Downham, p. 19; Annals of the Four Masters, s.aa. 861, 862; Annals of Ulster, s.aa. 861, 862; Choronicon Scotorum, s.a. 861 According to the Fragmentary Annals this alliance had been cemented by a political marriage: In later years, alliance between the Northern U√≠ N√©ill and the Vikings of Dublin became a regular occurrence: the Northern and Southern U√≠ N√©ill were frequent competitors for supremacy in Ireland, and the uneasy neighbourhood between Dublin and the Southern U√≠ N√©ill made the Vikings natural allies for the Northerners.

Downham concludes he is identical to Ivar the Boneless, a Viking leader who was active in England during this period as a commander of the Great Heathen Army.Downham, pp. 64-67, 139-142 According to O Croinin \\"√çmar has been identified with √çvarr Beinlausi (the boneless), son of Ragnar Lodbrok, but the matter is controversial\\".Downham, p. 251 In 866 Amla√≠b and Auisle led a large army to Pictland and raided much of the country, taking away many hostages.Downham, p. 21; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 866; Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 866 The native Irish kings took advantage of this absence to fight back against the growing Viking power in Ireland. In 866 a number of longphorts along the northern coast were destroyed by √Åed Findliath, overking of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 866; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 866; Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 866 It is possible that √Åed was still allied with Amla√≠b at this point, and that the longphorts which were razed belonged to Vikings not affiliated with the Dubliners, but by 868 at the latest Amla√≠b and √Åed were at war.Downham, pp. 21-22 In 865 or 866 a battle was won by Flann mac Conaing, overking of Brega, against the Vikings, possibly in retaliation for the raids on his land by Amla√≠b and his brothers in 863.Downham, p. 21; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 326 Numerous further setbacks for the Vikings occurred in 866-867 when their camps at Cork and Youghal were destroyed, an army was routed in Kerry, two battles were lost against the native Irish in Leinster, and Amla√≠b's fort at Clondalkin was destroyed.√ì Corrain, pp. 32-33; Downham, pp. 21-22; Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 867; Annals of the Four Masters, s.aa. 866, 867; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 866; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß¬ß 329, 349 Amla√≠b returned to Ireland in 867, probably to try to stop this string of defeats.Downham, p. 22 His return is attested to in the Annals of Inisfallen, which mention an \\"act of treachery\\" committed against the church of Lismore (modern-day County Waterford).Downham, p. 22; Annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 867 Around this time his brother Auisle was murdered by a kinsman, possibly by Amla√≠b himself.√ì Corrain, p. 33; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 347 In 868 another of Amla√≠b's kinsmen was killed, this time his son Carlus, who died in battle at Killineer (near the Boyne, County Louth), fighting against the forces of Amla√≠b's former ally √Åed Findliath.

Another victory came that year when a previously unknown \\"dark foreigner\\" known as √ölfr killed a king of southern Brega.Downham, p. 22; Annals of Clonmacnoise, s.a. 870; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 870; s.a. 870; Chronicum Scotorum The situation had evidently stabilised enough for Amla√≠b to go raiding in Britain again: in 870 Amla√≠b and √çmar (once more appearing in the Irish Annals after an absence of six years) laid siege to Dumbarton Rock, the chief fortress of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, and captured it following a four-month siege.Woolf, pp. 109-110; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 870 The pair returned to Dublin in 871 with 200 ships and they \\"brought with them in captivity a great prey of Angles, Britons and Picts\\".Woolf, pp. 109-110; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 871 Amla√≠b's return to Dublin in 871 is the final time he is mentioned in contemporary annals, but according to the Fragmentary Annals he returned to Lochlann that year to aid his father Gofraid in a war.Downham, pp. 238-240; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 400 According to the Pictish Chronicle, he died around 874 during a protracted campaign against Constantine I in Scotland:Downham, p. 142 Identification with Olaf the White The Viking sea-king Olaf the White, who features in several Nordic sagas, is positively identified with Amla√≠b by Hudson.Hudson According to Holman, \\"Olaf is usually identified with the Amla√≠b that is the first recorded king of the Vikings in Ireland.\\"Holman, p. 207 The Landn√°mab√≥k says that Olaf the White landed in Ireland in 852 and established the kingdom of Dublin, closely corresponding to the Irish annals' account of Amla√≠b.Landn√°mab√≥k, pp. xxviii, 62-63 Amla√≠b's lineage according to this saga is as follows: The Laxd√¶la saga offers a slightly different genealogy, naming Olaf the son of Ingjald, the son of King Frodi the Valiant. Both of these options are problematic since according to the Irish annals (albeit the non- contemporary Fragmentary Annals) Amla√≠b was the son of Gofraid, King of Lochlann.Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 400 The sagas identify Aud the Deep- minded, daughter of Ketill Flatnose, as Olaf's wife, but the Irish annals name a daughter of √Åed Findliath as the spouse of Amla√≠b in one account, and the daughter of \\"Cin√°ed\\" in another.Landn√°mab√≥k, p. 63; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 292 They also disagree on Amla√≠b/Olaf's children, the sagas naming Thorstein the Red, and the annals naming Oistin and Carlus.Landn√°mab√≥k, p. 63; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 875; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 868 Todd in his translation of Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh suggests that Thorstein and Oistin are the same person, but later historians have rejected this due to \\"the obvious discrepancy of their dates\\".Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh, p. lxxx; Proceedings of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow, Volume 40, p. 96 A further complication is that the Pictish Chronicle says Amla√≠b was killed in battle in Scotland, whereas the sagas say Olaf was killed in battle in Ireland.Pictish Chronicle, p. xxxiv; Landn√°mab√≥k, p. 63 Hudson proposes a solution for this apparent contradiction‚Äîthe Vikings did not distinguish between the Gaelic peoples of Scotland and Ireland. Family Amla√≠b's father is identified as Gofraid by the Fragmentary Annals. He was joined in Ireland by his brother √çmar sometime in or before 857 and by his brother Auisle sometime in or before 863.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 863 The three are identified as \\"kings of the foreigners\\" by the Annals of Ulster in 863, and as brothers by the Fragmentary Annals: The Annals of Ulster say that Auisle was killed in 867 by \\"kinsmen in parricide\\".Downham, p. 16, Annals of Ulster, s.a. 867 The Fragmentary Annals state explicitly that Amla√≠b and √çmar were responsible for their brother's death: Some scholars identify Halfdan Ragnarsson as another brother.Downham, p. 16 This identification is contingent upon √çmar being identical to Ivar the Boneless: Halfdan and Ivar are named as brothers in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 878 According to the Annals of Ulster Amla√≠b's son Oistin was slain in battle by \\"Albann\\" in 875.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 875 This figure is generally agreed to be Halfdan.South, p. 87 If that is correct, then it may explain the reason for the conflict: it was a dynastic squabble for control of the kingdom.Downham, p. 68 One potential problem is that according to Norse tradition Ivar and Halfdan were the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, whereas √çmar and Amla√≠b are named as sons of Gofraid in the Fragmentary Annals.Costambeys; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 347 However, the historicity of Ragnar is uncertain and the identification of Ragnar as the father of Ivar and Halfdan is not to be relied upon.Costambeys Two wives of Amla√≠b are mentioned by the annals. The first, an unnamed daughter of √Åed Findliath is mentioned in passing by the Fragmentary Annals with regards to an alliance between Amla√≠b and √Åed. Elsewhere the Fragmentary Annals, when reporting the death of Auisle, refer to \\"the daughter of Cin√°ed\\" as Amla√≠b's wife. It has been suggested that the reference to √Åed is mistaken, and that Amla√≠b's wife was a daughter of Cin√°ed mac Conaing, who had been drowned by M√°el Sechnaill in 851.Anderson, pp. 305-312 Another possibility is that the Cin√°ed in question is Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n (i.e., Kenneth MacAlpin, which would make Amla√≠b a brother-in-law of his killer Constantine I, a son of Kenneth).Smyth, p. 192 Two sons are noted by the annals: Oistin and Carlus, each of whom is mentioned a single time.Downham, pp. 249, 265 Both died violently: Carlus died in 868 fighting against √Åed Findliath and Oistin was \\"deceitfully killed by Albann\\" in 875.Annals of the Four Masters; s.a. 868; Annals of Ulster; s.a. 875 Family tree Notes References Citations Primary sources * Accessed via Internet Archive.   * Accessed via Internet Archive. * Accessed via Internet Archive.

History The station opened on 3 December 1862 with the Midland Great Western Railway extension from Longford to Sligo. The current station building is listed and was believed to have been built around 1875. A wall- mounted cast iron water fountain with the inscription \\"keep the pavement dry\\" was installed on the east platform around 1910. It is of skilled craftsmanship and the inscription is unusual. The passing loop was removed at some point between 1985 and 1993 with the track only serving the up platform. There was also a goods depot, shed and goods yard that have since been demolished. Accidents On 2 August 1903, a double-headed passenger train for Sligo collided with the mail train for Dublin. Three passengers were injured. The investigation concluded the passenger train, whose main driver had been on shift for 20 hours, had gone through a stop signal resulting in a Collision - road incorrectly set. The lead engine also did not have its braking system correctly connected to the main engine. Awards Ballymote was the winner of the National Best Station award in 2004.

He investigated Spiritualist mediums such as Willi Schneider, Rudi Schneider, and Valentine Dencausse. He is credited as the first forensic psychologist by Guinness World Records.First forensic psychologist: the first referenced use of a psychologist called upon to testify in a court of law was Dr Albert Von Schrenk-Notzing who, in 1896, drew upon his studies of suggestibility and memory recall to testify in a murder trial Mediumship Eva C Schrenck-Notzing investigated the medium Eva Carri√®re and believed the ectoplasm she produced was genuine. However, Schrenck-Notzing did not believe her ectoplasm \\"materializations\\" were anything to do with spirits, he claimed they were the result of \\"ideoplasty\\" in which the medium could form images onto ectoplasm from her mind.M. Brady Brower. (2010). Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France. University of Illinois Press. p. 120. Schrenck-Notzing published the book Phenomena of Materialisation in English translation (1920), which included photographs of the ectoplasm. Critics pointed out that the photographs of the ectoplasm revealed marks of magazine cut-outs, pins and a piece of string.Carlos Mar√≠a de Heredia. (1922). Spiritism and Common Sense. P. J.

(1912) The psychiatrist Mathilde Ludendorff wrote that the experiments of Schrenck- Notzing were unscientific and that he had been duped by tricks of Carri√®re. In the Schrenck-Notzing experiments with Carri√®re the scientific controls were scarce and there was evidence that she had freed her hands in the s√©ance room.Peter H. Aykroyd, Angela Narth. (2009).

(1939). Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Longmans, Green & Co. In 1920 Carri√®re was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research in London. An analysis of her ectoplasm revealed it to be made of chewed paper. She was also investigated in 1922 and the results of the tests were negative. Schrenck-Notzing admitted that on several occasions Carri√®re deceptively smuggled pins into the s√©ance room. The magician Carlos Mar√≠a de Heredia replicated the ectoplasm of Carri√®re using a comb, gauze and a handkerchief. Donald West wrote that the ectoplasm of Carri√®re was fake and was made of cut-out paper faces from newspapers and magazines on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carri√®re taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters \\"Le Miro\\". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir.Donald West. (1954). Psychical Research Today. Chapter S√©ance-Room Phenomena.

Doubleday. p. 187 In 1913 Miss Barkley in an article in the newspaper Neue Wiener Tagblatt had exposed the fraud of Carri√®re: > Miss Eva prepared the heads before every s√©ance, and endeavoured to make > them unrecognizable. A clean-shaven face was decorated with a beard. Grey > hairs became black curls, a broad forehead was made into a narrow one.

After Schrenck-Notzing discovered Carri√®re had taken her ectoplasm faces from the magazine he defended her by claiming she had read the magazine but her memory had recalled the images and they had materialized into the ectoplasm. Because of this Schrenck-Notzing was described as credulous.

He admitted that he had set out to deceive Schrenck-Notzing to reveal the inefficiency of psychical research. In 1928 Harry Price obtained the Kraus manuscript. Some of the manuscript was later reprinted by the American Society for Psychical Research and Schrenck- Notzing was charged of being a credulous investigator.Paul Tabori. (1974).

Various \\"materializations\\" were artificially attached to Eva's hair by wires. The discovery was never published by Geley. Eug√©ne Osty (the director of the institute) and members Jean Meyer, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing and Charles Richet all knew about the fraudulent photographs but were firm believers in mediumship phenomena so demanded the scandal be kept secret.

It was the first of three stations to be built in Collooney and remains the only one still in service. History Collooney once had three railway stations. The current station was opened by the Midland Great Western Railway (MGWR) on 3 December 1862 as part of the extension of its line from Longford to Sligo. On 1 September 1881 the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (SL&NCR;) opened its station to the east, before building a connection to the MGWR at Carrignagat Junction to the north and thus completing its line from Enniskillen to Sligo. Finally, on 1 October 1895, the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&WR;) opened its station to the west, as part of the extension of its line from Claremorris to Sligo. Following the creation of the Irish Free State, the MGWR and the GS&WR; became part of the Great Southern Railways (GSR) in 1925. In turn, the GSR became part of C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (CI√â) in 1945. On 1 October 1957, the SL&NCR;'s Collooney station closed along with the company. The line to Enniskillen was lifted shortly afterward. The GS&WR; station closed on 17 June 1963 when CI√â withdrew passenger services between Claremorris and Sligo; this line remained open for goods traffic until 1975, after which it fell into dereliction (though it is proposed to re-open in the future as part of the Western Railway Corridor).

It contains short discrete fibers that are uniformly distributed and randomly oriented. Fibers include steel fibers, glass fibers, synthetic fibers and natural fibers ‚Äì each of which lend varying properties to the concrete. In addition, the character of fiber-reinforced concrete changes with varying concretes, fiber materials, geometries, distribution, orientation, and densities. Historical perspective The concept of using fibers as reinforcement is not new. Fibers have been used as reinforcement since ancient times. Historically, horsehair was used in mortar and straw in mudbricks. In the 1900s, asbestos fibers were used in concrete. In the 1950s, the concept of composite materials came into being and fiber- reinforced concrete was one of the topics of interest. Once the health risks associated with asbestos were discovered, there was a need to find a replacement for the substance in concrete and other building materials. By the 1960s, steel, glass (GFRC), and synthetic (such as polypropylene) fibers were used in concrete. Research into new fiber-reinforced concretes continues today. Fibers are usually used in concrete to control cracking due to plastic shrinkage and to drying shrinkage. They also reduce the permeability of concrete and thus reduce bleeding of water. Some types of fibers produce greater impact, abrasion, and shatter resistance in concrete. Larger steel or synthetic fibers can replace rebar or steel completely in certain situations. Fiber reinforced concrete has all but completely replaced bar in underground construction industry such as tunnel segments where almost all tunnel linings are fiber reinforced in lieu of using rebar. Indeed, some fibers actually reduce the compressive strength of concrete.https://www.xetex.in/pp-fibres- india-xetex-industries-pr The amount of fibers added to a concrete mix is expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the composite (concrete and fibers), termed \\"volume fraction\\" (Vf). Vf typically ranges from 0.1 to 3%. The aspect ratio (l/d) is calculated by dividing fiber length (l) by its diameter (d). Fibers with a non-circular cross section use an equivalent diameter for the calculation of aspect ratio. If the fiber's modulus of elasticity is higher than the matrix (concrete or mortar binder), they help to carry the load by increasing the tensile strength of the material. Increasing the aspect ratio of the fiber usually segments the flexural strength and toughness of the matrix. Longer length results in better matrix inside the concrete and finer diameter increases the count of fibers. To ensure that each fiber strand is effective, it is recommended to use fibers longer than maximum size of aggregate. Normal concrete contains 19 mm equivalent diameter aggregate which is 35-45% of concrete, fibers longer than 20mm are more effective. However, fibers that are too long and not properly treated at time of processing tend to \\"ball\\" in the mix and create work-ability problems. Fibers are added for long term durability of concrete.

The High Speed 1 tunnel linings incorporated concrete containing 1 kg/m¬≥ or more of polypropylene fibers, of diameter 18 & 32 Œºm, giving the benefits noted below.. Adding fine diameter polypropylene fibers, not only provides reinforcement in tunnel lining, but also prevents \\"spalling\\" and damage of lining in case of fire due to accident. FIRE PROTECTION OF CONCRETE TUNNEL LININGS by Peter Shuttleworth, Rail Link Engineering. UK Benefits Glass fibers can: * Improve concrete strength at low cost. * Adds tensile reinforcement in all directions, unlike rebar. * Add a decorative look as they are visible in the finished concrete surface. Polypropylene and nylon fibers can: *Improve mix cohesion, improving pumpability over long distances *Improve freeze-thaw resistance *Improve resistance to explosive spalling in case of a severe fire *Improve impact‚Äì and abrasion‚Äìresistance *Increase resistance to plastic shrinkage during curing *Improve structural strength *Reduce steel reinforcement requirements *Improve ductility *Reduce crack widths and control the crack widths tightly, thus improving durability Steel fibers can: *Improve structural strength *Reduce steel reinforcement requirements *Reduce crack widths and control the crack widths tightly, thus improving durability *Improve impact‚Äì and abrasion‚Äìresistance *Improve freeze-thaw resistance Blends of both steel and polymeric fibers are often used in construction projects in order to combine the benefits of both products; structural improvements provided by steel fibers and the resistance to explosive spalling and plastic shrinkage improvements provided by polymeric fibers. In certain specific circumstances, steel fiber or macro synthetic fibers can entirely replace traditional steel reinforcement bar (\\"rebar\\") in reinforced concrete. This is most common in industrial flooring but also in some other precasting applications. Typically, these are corroborated with laboratory testing to confirm that performance requirements are met. Care should be taken to ensure that local design code requirements are also met, which may impose minimum quantities of steel reinforcement within the concrete. There are increasing numbers of tunnelling projects using precast lining segments reinforced only with steel fibers. Micro-Rebar has also been recently tested and approved to replace traditional reinforcement in vertical walls designed in accordance with ACI 318 Chapter 14.http://www.core-construction- products.com/pdfs/ACI-318-IBC-IRC-Evaluation-report-Helix-Steel-Micro-Rebar- Alternative-to-Steel-Rebar-Concrete-reinforcement-Vertical-Applications.pdf Some developments At least half of the concrete in a typical building component is used to protect the steel reinforcement from corrosion.

An FRC sub-category named High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC) claims 500 times more resistance to cracking and 40 percent lighter than traditional concrete. HPFRC claims it can sustain strain-hardening up to several percent strain, resulting in a material ductility of at least two orders of magnitude higher when compared to normal concrete or standard fiber-reinforced concrete. HPFRC also claims a unique cracking behavior. When loaded to beyond the elastic range, HPFRC maintains crack width to below 100 ¬µm, even when deformed to several percent tensile strains. Field results with HPFRC and The Michigan Department of Transportation resulted in early-age cracking. Recent studies performed on a high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete in a bridge deck found that adding fibers provided residual strength and controlled cracking. There were fewer and narrower cracks in the FRC even though the FRC had more shrinkage than the control. Residual strength is directly proportional to the fiber content. Some studies were performed using waste carpet fibers in concrete as an environmentally friendly use of recycled carpet waste. A carpet typically consists of two layers of backing (usually fabric from polypropylene tape yarns), joined by CaCO3 filled styrene-butadiene latex rubber (SBR), and face fibers (majority being nylon 6 and nylon 66 textured yarns). Such nylon and polypropylene fibers can be used for concrete reinforcement. Other ideas are emerging to use recycled materials as fibers: recycled Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber, for example.

The book was part of the basis for the 2002 Austrian documentary Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekret√§rin (titled Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary in English) and the film Der Untergang (The Downfall) in 2004. Synopsis This memoir deals with the years (1942‚Äì1945) that Traudl Junge spent with Adolf Hitler as his personal secretary. When he first hired her, by chance as it turns out, she was 21 years old and was sought out because a secretary needed to be replaced. During Traudl Junge's time with Hitler, she claims that she was blind to the genocidal activities that were conducted around her because she was so spellbound by Hitler's paternal charisma. She also describes in great detail some of the luxuries that she and other secretaries took advantage of while working for Hitler. For instance, she was treated to tea-parties and dinner parties with Hitler, Eva Braun, the other secretaries (all women), and the military chiefs. Traudl married Hans Hermann Junge, one of Hitler's military \\"orderlies\\". Although they were in love, they were hesitant to marry so soon because they had not known each other for very long. Hitler, however, goaded her into marrying Junge, which occurred in June 1943. As the years passed, Hitler's health deteriorated, Germany began losing the war, and Hans Junge was killed in combat at the front in August 1944. They traveled a great deal, going from the East Prussia Wolfsschanze (Wolf's Lair), to the Berghof, to Munich, to the Reichskanzlei (Reich Chancellery) and back, all by way of train. Once the Red Army began sweeping across eastern Europe after Stalingrad fell, the Wolfsschanze had to be abandoned. Hitler had two bunkers built around the Reich Chancellery for protection from the air raids. The author was in the Reich Chancellery, the Vorbunker (upper bunker) and the lower F√ºhrerbunker with Hitler. Therein, they (along with Eva Braun and the others) awaited the eventual, inevitable fall of Berlin to the Soviet Army. Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler provided everyone with cyanide capsules. Hitler stated outright he would stay in Berlin, head up the defense of the city and shoot himself before he would surrender to the Soviet Union. The mood in the bunker in the final days was one primarily of depression and hopelessness. Hitler was dubious that the cyanide capsules would be powerful enough to kill him, so before he attempted his suicide, he tested a capsule on his beloved dog Blondi. The capsule killed Blondi almost instantly. In the afternoon of 30 April, Hitler killed himself with a gunshot wound to the right temple, using his own Walther PPK semiautomatic pistol chambered for 7.65 mm/.32 ACP. Eva Braun, his bride of fewer than 40 hours, used cyanide by itself. Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda poisoned their six children with cyanide (to Junge's horror) and their bodies were found, in their beds in the Vorbunker, by the Soviets a few days later. Goebbels and his wife either committed suicide or had the SS guards shoot them (\\"eyewitness\\" accounts differ on this point). Eventually, Junge and others still in the bunker complex were led out by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Wilhelm Mohnke to try and break out of the Soviet encirclement. She and another secretary wanted to avoid the Soviets, so they decided to flee. Junge was eventually captured by soldiers of the Soviet Red Army but was held only briefly when she was later in the custody of the Americans. Considered to be merely a \\"young follower\\" she was quickly released and was never prosecuted for any crime. In 1989 her manuscript detailing the war years was first published in the book Voices from the Bunker by Pierre Galante and Eugene Silianoff (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons).

It causes severe seizures, which are often frequent and hard to control. A minority might have seizure control with medicines, but most will need removal or disconnection of the affected hemisphere as the best chance. Uncontrolled, they often cause progressive intellectual disability and brain damage and stop development. Symptoms and signs Seizures are the main symptom. There can be as many as hundreds of seizures a day. Seizures usually begin days right after birth, though they can be delayed by months or, rarely, start in early childhood.  Other symptoms  * Asymmetrical or enlarged head * Developmental delay * Progressive weakness of half the body * Progressive blindness of half the body Genetics Somatic activation of AKT3 causes hemispheric developmental brain malformations. Pathophysiology It is a disorder related to excessive neuronal proliferation and hamartomatous overgrowth affecting the cortical formation. The excessive proliferation is postulated to occur early and to possibly continue beyond the normal proliferative period. Epidermal growth factor is thought to play an important role in the excessive proliferation and the pathogenesis of HME. Diagnosis It should be suspected in infants or children with intractable, frequent seizures. On a CT scan, the affected part is distorted and enlarged. It can be diagnosed prenatally, but a lot of cases go undiagnosed until seizures begin. Ultrasound can display asymmetrical brain hemispheres. Treatment Although there have been a few reports of medical treatment, the main treatment is radical: remove or disconnect the affected side. However, it has a high mortality, and there have been reports of a vegetative state and seizures resuming, this time in the healthy hemisphere. Surgery should be done as early as possible to minimize damage caused by seizures. However, a trial with drugs can be attempted for a few months before surgery, and there is a slim chance of it succeeding. The earlier surgery be done, the more the remaining side will do the missing side's job. Benzodiazepines might control the seizures.

(1933). Supernormal Aspects of Energy and Matter. Society for Psychical Research. Early career Schneider began participating in s√©ances with his elder brother Willi Schneider at age 11. Both Rudi and Willi claimed to channel a spirit entity called \\"Olga\\" who in the s√©ance room claimed to be \\"Lola Montez\\" the nickname of Eliza Eosanna Gilbert (1821-1861) the mistress of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Schneider held his first solo s√©ance in 1919 and is said to have been able to summon the ghostly image of a human hand, as well as a number of other manifestations that are traditionally associated with s√©ances. Investigations Schneider began giving demonstrations to the Vienna Institut fur Radiumforschung der Academic der Wissenschaffen in 1923. In an investigation into the mediumship of Schneider in 1924 the physicists Stefan Meyer and Karl Przibram caught Schneider evading the controls in a series of s√©ances. After Meyer and Przibram's accusations, the institute concluded that the abilities that Schneider had demonstrated up to that point were all, based on the balance of probability, the result of trickery and that he was no-longer of interest to them.Price, Harry. (1936). Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter. Putnam. p. 233. \\"Rudi has been accused of producing spurious phenomena many times, by many persons. In 1924 Professors Meyer and Przibram, of Vienna, accused him of evading control.

Malcolm Bird who attended a s√©ance with Schneider also supported Vinton's accusations.Reuter, William. (1941). An Objective Study in Extra-sensory Perception.

Vinton, again visited Braunau for sittings with Willi and Rudi. They hoped to substantiate Dingwall's theory that the sittings in the Schneider Home were fraudulent, perpetrated by the various members of the family. Vinton wrote a report in which he concluded that the phenomena observed during the ten s√©ances he had attended were caused by someone who had entered the s√©ance room secretly, unknown to the sitters.\\"Guiley, Rosemary. (1994). The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits. Guinness World Records Limited. p. 293. \\"The first major controversy erupted following publication in the metaphysical journal Psyche of a hypothesis of fraud that involved a confederate sneaking into the s√©ance room unobserved. The article was written by an American journalist, W. J. Vinton, who had attended 10 s√©ances along with Dingwall. Vinton's hypothesis was supported by Malcolm Bird of the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR), who attended only a single s√©ance during which he was supposed to have been guarding the door. Another skeptic was Walter Franklin Prince, who attended 10 sittings and saw only some curtains blowing, which he concluded could have been contrived.\\"Franklyn, Julian. (2003). Dictionary of the Occult. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 228. \\"In 1926 Mr. W. J. Vinton sat several times with Rudi at the latter's home in Braunau and came to the conclusion that the movements of objects were fraudulently produced by other members of the Schneider family concealed in the room. In 1927 Mr. Malcolm Bird, the editor of The Scientific American, also had a sitting at Braunau and came to the same conclusion of a conspiracy of fraud.\\" The parapsychologist Walter Franklin Prince attended a series of sittings with Schneider and no paranormal phenomena was observed. In his notes in the Bulletin VII of the Boston SPR published under Experiments with Physical Mediums in Europe (1928) he wrote \\"despite my studied and unremitting complaisance, no phenomena have occurred when I had any part in the control, save curtain movement which were capable of the simplest explanation.\\"Spence, Lewis.

In 1929, Schneider took part in a number of experiments conducted by notable investigator/debunker Harry Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. Price conducted a series of experiments in which Schneider was connected to a series of pressure switches that would alert observers if he moved his hands, feet or limbs in any significant way. Schneider was also physically restrained during some of the experiments. Price recorded that during his experiments various phenomena were observed; including the movement of objects placed around the room and the apparent manifestation of mysterious hands and shapes. Schneider claimed he could levitate objects but according to Price a photograph taken on April 28, 1932 showed that Schneider had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. After this, many scientists considered Schneider to be exposed as a fraud, however there was a controversy over the photograph from the parapsychology community.Price, Harry. (2003). Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Kessinger Publishing. (reprint) Holroyd, Stuart. (1976). Minds Without Boundaries. Aldus Books. p. 63. Holroyd reprinted a large version of the photograph in his book and a zoom in on Schneider. The photograph depicts Schneider in a pajama jacket with a freed hand reaching out to move a handkerchief from the table. Price wrote that the findings of the other experiments should be revised due to the evidence showing how Schneider could free himself from the controls.Spence, Lewis. (2003). Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 806 After Price had exposed Schneider, various scientists such as Karl Przibram and the magician Henry Evans wrote to Price telling him that they agreed that Schneider evaded control during his s√©ances and congratulated Price on the success of unmasking the fraud.Tabori, Paul. (1966). Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter. Living Books. pp. 114-115 In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Schneider's mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that the Price photograph was a hoax.Evans, Hilary. (1982). Intrusions: Society and the Paranormal. Routledge Kegan & Paul. p. 166. SPR member Anita Gregory claimed Price had deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Schneider's reputation.Gregory, Anita. (1977). Anatomy of a Fraud: Harry Price and the Medium Rudi Schneider. Annals of Science 34: 449-549. The psychologist Alan Gauld wrote that Gregory's analysis of the photograph was misconceived and there was no direct evidence the photograph taken by Price had been tampered with.Gauld, Alan. (1978). Review of Anita Gregory's Anatomy of a Fraud: Harry Price and the Medium Rudi Schneider. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (Vol. 49, pp. 828-835). In opposition to Gregory the photographic expert Vernon Harrison testified that the photograph was genuine.Harrison, Vernon. (1979). Letter to the Editor. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. 50: 45-46. Harrison suggested that instead of fraud the shock of the flash caused Schneider to jerk involuntarily breaking free from the control, and when the second flash went off, recorded him in that position.Harrison, Vernon. (1987). The Mediumship of Willi and Rudi Schneider. Journal of the Unitarian Society for Psychical Studies. No. 38, Winter. SPR member John L. Randall who reviewed the Price and Schneider case also came to the conclusion the photograph was genuine. However, Randall disagreed with Harrison that Schneider's movement was accidental and wrote the photograph was evidence for Price's claim that Schneider had freed his hand with fraudulent intent.Randall, John. (2000). Harry Price: The Case for the Defence. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (Vol. 64.3, No. 860). V. J. Woolley criticized the electronic controls of Price's experiments. He noted they were liable to go wrong such as a broken wire and that they were not fraud proof like Price had claimed. According to Woolley one sitter alone could \\"free his feet by connecting his metal floor plates by a piece of wire... I do not feel that the electrical control excludes [fraud] any better than the older methods which Mr Price describes as obsolete\\".Woolley, V. J. (1930). Harry Price. Rudi Schneider: A Scientific Examination of His Mediumship. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 25: 125-126. Eug√©ne Osty In 1930, Schneider began working with French paranormal investigator Eug√©ne Osty at the Institut Metapsychique. Osty placed an object in the room with Schneider and targeted it with a camera that had an infrared trigger designed to take a picture if it detected movement around the object. The alarm was triggered several times though the photographs showed no evidence of Schneider having interfered with it. Osty concluded that he was recording the passage of an ectoplasm like substance that was indicative of telekinetic movement. He wrote that the substance registered on sound recording equipment when it moved, and that it could pass through objects put in place to impede it. Osty's experiments with Schneider have been criticized by skeptics. D. H. Rawcliffe for example noted that \\"various discrepancies have come to light which throw the whole of Osty's experiments into doubt. Price made a prolonged investigation of Rudi Schneider and proved conclusively that the medium resorted to trickery when he believed himself to be unobserved... Osty has too often shown in the past, despite some intellectual ability, evidence of an amateurish and uncritical approach to his subject.\\"Rawcliffe, D. H. (1987). Occult and Supernatural Phenomena. Dover Publications. p. 315 Other tests Price testing Rudi Schneider. In the 1920s Fritz Wittels who had attended s√©ances with Schneider wrote that \\"With occult waves running high in Vienna, there was a famous medium named Rudi Schneider, a few of whose meetings I attended. Whenever I came, however, either nothing happened at all or the things which did happen were obvious frauds.\\"Wittels, Fritz. (1996). Freud and the Child Woman: The Memoirs of Fritz Wittels. Yale University Press. p. 6 It was reported by Stefan Meyer that Schneider was exposed as a fraud by Dr. Lothar Lenkei.Besterman, Theodore. (1968). Collected Papers on the Paranormal. Garrett Publications. p. 377 In 1928, E. R. Dodds and V. J. Woolley attended six s√©ances in dim red light with Schneider and absolutely no phenomena occurred. Dodds wrote that semen was found after one of the s√©ances.Dodds, E. R. (2000). Missing Persons: An Autobiography. Oxford University Press. pp. 101-102. In a series of mediumship sessions in 1932 which included the researchers and scientists Dr. William Brown, C. E. M. Joad, Professor D. F. Fraser-Harris, Professor John Alexander Gunn and Julian Huxley, no paranormal phenomena was observed in the s√©ance room with Schneider. Huxley wrote that there was \\"no proof of any communication with departed spirits\\".Huxley, Julian. (1970). Memories. Allen & Unwin. p. 177 Zoologist Solly Zuckerman also attended some s√©ance sittings and wrote that the mediumship of Schneider had not passed any scientific tests.Zuckerman, Solly. (1979). From Apes to Warlords: The Autobiography (1904-1946) of Solly Zuckerman. Hamilton. p. 49. William Howard Livens on 15 November 1932 attended a s√©ance with Schneider and no paranormal phenomenon was observed.Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research. 1932. Volume 41. Between October 1933 and March 1934 Schneider was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research in fifty-five sittings and not a single paranormal phenomenon was observed. Infrared ray apparatus was installed by Oliver Gatty working with Theodore Besterman. The experiments proved negative, no telekinetic phenomena of any kind were observed or any absorption of the infrared rays. Every chance was given to Schneider to prove his alleged paranormal abilities but nothing paranormal occurred. Another researcher, Whately Carington had proven by tests that the spirit \\"Olga\\" which Schneider channeled in reality was indistinguishable in psychological make-up from himself.Franklyn, Julian. (2003). Dictionary of the Occult. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 230 Oliver Gatty and Theodore Besterman communicated their results to Nature, concluding that in their tests there was \\"no good evidence that Rudi Schneider possesses supernormal powers.\\" There were no more investigations as in his later years Schneider gave up mediumship to become an auto mechanic.

This shark forms the E. pusillus species group with the smooth lanternshark, which are distinguished from other members of its family by having irregularly arranged, flat-topped dermal denticles that give them a \\"smooth\\" appearance. Both species are slender-bodied with long heads, two dorsal fins bearing spines, no anal fins, and light-emitting photophores. The blurred lanternshark is larger, reaching or more in length. This species feeds on small squid, fishes, and fish eggs, and is ovoviviparous. It has been assessed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, because of its wide distribution and lack of threat from fishing pressure. Taxonomy and phylogeny Japanese ichthyologists Shigeru Shirai and Hiroyuki Tachikawa described the blurred lanternshark in a 1993 article in the scientific journal Copeia, as part of a taxonomic revision of the Etmopterus pusillus species group. Shirai and Tachikawa found that the species group comprises the smooth lanternshark (E. pusillus) and a hitherto unrecognized second species, which they named E. bigelowi in honor of Henry B. Bigelow (who, along with William C. Schroeder and Stewart Springer, first described the blurred lanternshark in 1955, but did not see it as being separate from E. pusillus). The E. pusillus species group is distinguished from other lanternsharks in having truncate (ending in a flat crown as though the tip were cut off), irregularly arranged dermal denticles. This species may also be referred to as the smooth lanternshark or the blurred smooth lanternshark. Distribution and habitat Blurred lanternsharks have been caught around the world over continental and insular shelves and slopes, submarine ridges, and seamounts. In the Atlantic Ocean, it is known from the Gulf of Mexico to Argentina, and off western and southern Africa. In the Indo-Pacific, it has been reported from off Okinawa and Australia, as well as on the Emperor and Hancock Seamounts in the central North Pacific and over the Nazca Plate off Peru. It is partially pelagic and occurs at depths of in open water, and from to over near the bottom. Like many other lantern sharks, adults are found deeper than juveniles. Description Growing to a length of at least , the blurred lanternshark has a slender body, large head, and short tail. The snout is wedge-shaped and slightly flattened, tapering to a point. The nostrils are large, with short flaps of skin in front. The eyes are oval in shape with a deep anterior notch in the orbit. The mouth has long furrows at the corners that extend halfway to the first of five gill slits. There are 19-24 tooth rows in the upper jaw, each with a narrow central cusp flanked by 2-4 pairs of smaller cusplets, increasing in number with age in males over long. There are 25-39 tooth rows in the lower jaw, each tooth with a smooth-edged, knife-like cusp and their bases interlocked to form a single cutting surface; the teeth of males over long and females over long become more erect with age. The first dorsal fin is close to the pectoral than the pelvic fins, and bear a straight, grooved spine in front. The second dorsal fin is half again as tall as the first and bears a longer, curved spine. The pectoral fins are rounded at the tips, with the distance between them and the medium-sized, angular pelvic fins about equal to the distance between the dorsal fins. The anal fin is absent. The caudal peduncle is narrow, leading to a caudal fin with a well-developed lower lobe and a broad upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The small, blocky dermal denticles are densely but irregularly arranged, each with a flat, truncate crown. The coloration is brown or gray above, with a pale spot over the pineal gland, and black below extending in faint markings over the sides of the head, under the pectoral fins, over the pelvic fins, and below the caudal peduncle. Like other lanternsharks, the blurred lanternshark possesses a species- specific light-emitting photophores, which are not placed in prominent bands. The blurred lanternshark is very similar to the smooth lanternshark, but is larger and can be reliably differentiated by the number of turns in the spiral valve intestine (16-19 versus 10-13). Biology and ecology The diet of the blurred lanternshark consists of squid, smaller dogfish sharks, lanternfishes, and fish eggs. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with developing embryos being sustained by a yolk sac and being born live at a length of . Males attain sexual maturity at around long, and females at long. Human interactions Blurred lanternsharks are harmless and of no commercial significance, but may be caught and discarded by deepwater fisheries. Because of its wide distribution and the lack of evidence for heavy fishing mortality, the IUCN has assessed this species as of Least Concern.

ISI is recognized as an IB World School, offering immersion programs for its students in the Spanish, French, and Mandarin Chinese languages, with students picking up a third language in grade 6. History In 1991 an Indiana Humanities Council task force was established to address Indiana‚Äôs position in a changing world. The Task Force report, titled Indiana in a Changing World ‚Äì A Strategy for Action, emphasized the need for Indiana to: * Participate in the world community and world economy * Attract foreign companies and specialist employees * Make Indiana students more internationally competitive One of the report‚Äôs major recommendations led to the creation of the International School of Indiana in 1994. In July 2002, ISI was authorized to enroll Juniors and Seniors into the IB Diploma Programme (DP), officially making the institution an IB School. By 2004, ISI saw its first graduating class, consisting of 8 students. 2009 was a formative year for the school, where the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP) began to be incorporated into the curriculum in grades 1-5 and 6-10 respectively. ISI received certification for both programs in 2011, giving them the distinctive honor as the only school in the Midwestern United States to offer IB, MYP and PYP diplomas to its students. In addition to this, ISI announced the launch of its Mandarin Chinese immersion program for students in the same year. In 2014, ISI was recognized by The Washington Post as one of the most challenging high schools in the country, due to the enduring nature of the IB Diploma Programme and the fact that all students are required to sit for these college-level exams at the end of their senior year. https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/local/high-school-challenge-2017/ The launch of the ONE ISI campaign in 2019 established the school's intention to unify the Lower and Upper School campuses by the 2021-22 academic year. One of six like-minded international schools in the United States, ISI offers an integrated International Baccalaureate curriculum that is transferable to schools around the world. The ISI curriculum imparts the problem-solving skills students need in the 21st-century economy. Campus The school campus is situated in the Butler-Tarkington neighborhood of Indianapolis, with the majority of the facilities situated on 60 wooded acres north of the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Grades 6 through 12 are located at 4330 Michigan Road, and pre-kindergarten through Grade 5 classes are held at the school's 49th Street building. Curriculum The school has an accredited IB Diploma Programme, Middle Years Programme, and the Primary Years Programme. ISI is the only school in the Midwest where all of its upper school students participate in the full International Baccalaureate Diploma programme. Extracurricular activities Student groups and activities include the Aid to Congo Project, Habitat for Humanity, Literary Arts Society, Model United Nations, an Oxfam banquet, student government, the Timmy Foundation, the Gryphon Voices choir, art club, yearbook and sports.International School of Indiana Retrieved April 15, 2011.

Swiss-born, he was widely regarded as the dean of the local parks movement in America. The various titles he was given included administrator of parks, horticulturalist, and park planner. Before emigrating to America in 1888, he worked as a florist and landscaper in Zurich, London, and Paris. He married Leonie Mense, the daughter of his employer in Glen Cove, Long Island, before taking a job as superintendent of parks in Hartford, Connecticut in 1896, where he developed the first municipal rose garden in the country. In 1904 the city of Minneapolis offered him the position of Superintendent of Parks in that fast-growing Midwest city. His goal provided for a playground within a quarter-mile of every child and a complete recreation center within a half-mile of every family. During his 30-year tenure there, he expanded the park system from to , in a city of 37,387 acres (14%). Park land included parks, golf courses, flower gardens and boulevards. Unlike earlier park planners, he believed that parks ought to be used by the residents. His park development is enjoyed daily by residents and visitors on the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway, at Minnehaha Falls, along the path following Minnehaha Creek, at Lake Harriet, Bde Maka Ska, Lyndale Park, Winchell Trail, and scores of other public open spaces in Minneapolis. The lakes, parks, and outdoor recreation areas that Minneapolis features are often cited by users as one of the most important factors in their quality of life. Wirth's home and park planning offices Several Minneapolis recreation areas bear his name, including the Wirth Lake, which is in Theodore Wirth Park. At , it is by far the largest park in the Minneapolis park system. The Theodore Wirth House- Administration Building is on the National Register of Historic Places because \\"it was built as a home for Theodore Wirth, an international figure in the field of park design\\" and \\"his administration offices within the building were the actual location where Theodore Wirth designed or redesigned the award- winning Minneapolis parks.\\" The house was constructed to Wirth's specification and located in a corner of Lyndale Farmstead Park. Wirth wanted to be inspired by watching people using parks. In 2004 the Theodore Wirth Statue Garden, designed by his grandson Theodore J. Wirth, was opened. The sculpture, by Bill Rains, consists of a 115%-sized bronze statue of Wirth surrounded by twelve children representing the diverse population of Minneapolis and his policies of equal access for all people regardless of race or economic status. Wirth left his legacy in Minneapolis and via his three children: Conrad L. Wirth became director of the National Park Service; Walter L. Wirth was superintendent of parks in New Haven, Connecticut, and superintendent of the Salem, Oregon, Regional Parks System. The third son, Theodore, enjoyed a distinguished career, attaining the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy.

The topic is a complex amalgamation of the practices of folk healers, folk magic, ancient belief in sorcery in pagan Europe, Christian views on heresy, medieval and early modern practice of ceremonial magic and simple fiction in folklore and literature. History Antiquity Instances of persecution of witchcraft in the classical period were documented, paralleling evidence from the ancient Near East and the Old Testament. In ancient Greece, for example, Theoris, a woman of Lemnos, was prosecuted for casting incantations and using harmful drugs. She was executed along with her family. defixion from Eyguieres In Ancient Rome black magic was punished as a capital offence by the Law of the Twelve Tables, which are to be assigned to the 5th century BC, and, as Livy records, from time to time Draconian statutes were directed against those who attempted to blight crops and vineyards or to spread disease among flocks and cattle. The terms of the frequent references in Horace to Canidia illustrate the odium in which sorceresses were held. Under the Empire, in the third century, the punishment of burning alive was enacted by the State against witches who compassed another person's death through their enchantments.Julius Paulus, \\"Sent.\\", V, 23, 17 Nevertheless, all the while normal legislation utterly condemned witchcraft and its works, while the laws were not merely carried out to their very letter, but reinforced by such emperors as Claudius, Vitellius, and Vespasian. In the imperial period, it is evident from many Latin authors and from the historians that Rome swarmed with occultists and diviners, many of whom in spite of the Lex Cornelia almost openly traded in poisons, and not infrequently in assassination to boot. Paradoxical as it may appear, such emperors as Augustus, Tiberius, and Septimius Severus, while banishing from their realms all seers and necromancers, and putting them to death, in private entertained astrologers and wizards among their retinue, consulting their art upon each important occasion, and often even in the everyday and ordinary affairs of life. These prosecutions are significant, as they establish that and the prohibition under severest penalties, the sentence of death itself of witchcraft was demonstrably not a product of Christianity, but had long been employed among polytheistic societies. The ecclesiastical legislation followed a similar but milder course. The Council of Elvira (306), Canon 6, refused the holy Viaticum to those who had killed a man by a \\"per maleficium\\", translated as \\"visible effect of malicious intention\\" and adds the reason that such a crime could not be effected \\"without idolatry\\"; which probably means without the aid of the Devil, devil-worship and idolatry being then convertible terms. Similarly canon 24 of the Council of Ancyra (314) imposes five years of penance upon those who consult magicians, and here again the offence is treated as being a practical participation in paganism. This legislation represented the mind of the Church for many centuries. Similar penalties were enacted at the Eastern council in Trullo (692), while certain early Irish canons in the far West treated sorcery as a crime to be visited with excommunication until adequate penance had been performed. The early legal codes of most European nations contain laws directed against witchcraft. Thus, for example, the oldest document of Frankish legislation, the Salic law, which was reduced to a written form and promulgated under Clovis, who died 27 November, 511, punishes those who practice magic with various fines, especially when it could be proven that the accused launched a deadly curse, or had tied the Witch's Knot. The laws of the Visigoths, which were to some extent founded upon the Roman law, punished witches who had killed any person by their spells with death; while long-continued and obstinate witchcraft, if fully proven, was visited with such severe sentences as slavery for life. Christianization and Early Middle Ages The Pactus Legis Alamannorum, an early 7th-century code of laws of the Alemanni confederation of Germanic tribes, lists witchcraft as a punishable crime on equal terms with poisoning. If a free man accuses a free woman of witchcraft or poisoning, the accused may be disculpated either by twelve people swearing an oath on her innocence or by one of her relatives defending her in a trial by combat. In this case, the accuser is required to pay a fine (Pactus Legis Alamannorum 13). With Christianization, belief in witchcraft came to be seen as superstition. The Council of Leptinnes in 744 drew up a \\"List of Superstitions\\", which prohibited sacrifice to saints and created a baptismal formula that required one to renounce works of demons, specifically naming Thor and Odin. Persecution of witchcraft nevertheless persisted throughout most of the Early Middle Ages, into the 10th century. When Charlemagne imposed Christianity upon the people of Saxony in 789, he proclaimed: The earliest known portrait of Saint Augustine in a 6th-century fresco, Lateran, Rome Similarly, the Lombard code of 643 states: This conforms to the thoughts of Saint Augustine of Hippo, who taught that witchcraft did not exist and that the belief in it was heretical.The Canon Episcopi In 814, Louis the Pious upon his accession to the throne began to take very active measures against all sorcerers and necromancers, and it was owing to his influence and authority that the Council of Paris in 829 appealed to the secular courts to carry out any such sentences as the Bishops might pronounce. The consequence was that from this time forward the penalty of witchcraft was death, and there is evidence that if the constituted authority, either ecclesiastical or civil, seemed to slacken in their efforts the populace took the law into their own hands with far more fearful results. In England, the early Penitentials are greatly concerned with the repression of pagan ceremonies, which under the cover of Christian festivities were very largely practised at Christmas and on New Year's Day. These rites were closely connected with witchcraft, and especially do S. Theodore, S. Aldhelm, Ecgberht of York, and other prelates prohibit the masquerade as a horned animal, a stag, or a bull, which S. Caesarius of Arles had denounced as a \\"foul tradition\\", an \\"evil custom\\", a \\"most heinous abomination\\". The laws of King √Üthelstan (924‚Äì40), corresponsive with the early French laws, punished any person casting a spell which resulted in death by extracting the extreme penalty. Among the laws attributed to the Pictish King Cin√°ed mac Ailpin (ruled 843 to 858), is an important statute which enacts that all sorcerers and witches, and such as invoke spirits, \\"and use to seek upon them for helpe, let them be burned to death\\". Even then this was obviously no new penalty, but the statutory confirmation of a long-established punishment. So the witches of Forres who attempted the life of King Duffus in the year 968 by the old bane of slowly melting a wax image, when discovered, were according to the law burned at the stake. The text of the canon Episcopi in Hs. 119 (Cologne), a manuscript of Decretum Burchardi dated to ca. 1020. The Canon Episcopi, which was written circa 900 AD (though alleged to date from 314 AD), once more following the teachings of Saint Augustine, declared that witches did not exist and that anyone who believed in them was a heretic. The crucial passage from the Canon Episcopi reads as follows: Early modern witch hunts The origins of the accusations against witches in the Early Modern period are eventually present in trials against heretics, which trials include claims of secret meetings, orgies, and the consumption of babies. From the 15th century, the idea of a pact became important‚Äîone could be possessed by the Devil and not responsible for one's actions, but to be a witch, one had to sign a pact with the Devil, often to worship him, which was heresy and meant damnation. The idea of an explicit and ceremonial pact with the Devil was crucial to the development of the witchcraft concept, because it provided an explanation that differentiated the figure of the witch from that of the learned necromancer or sorcerer (whose magic was presumed to be diabolic in source, but with the power to wield it being achieved through rigorous application of study and complex ritual). A rise in the practice of necromancy in the 12th century, spurred on by an influx of texts on magic and diabolism from the Islamic world, had alerted clerical authorities to the potential dangers of malefic magic. This elevated concern was slowly expanded to include the common witch, but clerics needed an explanation for why uneducated commoners could perform feats of diabolical sorcery that rivaled those of the most seasoned and learned necromancers. The idea that witches gained their powers through a pact with the Devil provided a satisfactory explanation, and allowed authorities to develop a mythology through which they could project accusations of crimes formerly associated with various heretical sects (incestuous orgies, cannibalism, ritual infanticide, and the worship of demonic familiars) onto the newly emerging threat of diabolical witchcraft. This pact and the ceremony that accompanied it became widely known as the witches' sabbath. The Malleus Maleficarum was influential in 17th-century European witch trials By 1300, the elements were in place for a witch hunt, and for the next century and a half, fear of witches spread gradually throughout Europe. At the end of the Middle Ages (about 1450), the fear became a craze that lasted more than 200 years. As the notion spread that all magic involved a pact with the Devil, legal sanctions against witchcraft grew harsher. Each new conviction reinforced the beliefs in the methods (torture and pointed interrogation) being used to solicit confessions and in the list of accusations to which these \\"witches\\" confessed. The rise of the witch-craze was concurrent with the rise of Renaissance magic in the great humanists of the time (this was called High Magic, and the Neoplatonists and Aristotelians that practised it took pains to insist that it was wise and benevolent and nothing like Witchcraft), which helped abet the rise of the craze. Witchcraft was held to be the worst of heresies, and early skepticism slowly faded from view almost entirely. In the early 14th century, many accusations were brought against clergymen and other learned people who were capable of reading and writing magic; Pope Boniface VIII (d. 1303) was posthumously tried for apostasy, murder, and sodomy, in addition to allegedly entering into a pact with the Devil (while popes had been accused of crimes before, the demonolatry charge was new). The Templars were also tried as Devil-invoking heretics in 1305‚Äì14. The middle years of the 14th century were quieter, but towards the end of the century, accusations increased and were brought against ordinary people more frequently. In 1398, the University of Paris declared that the demonic pact could be implicit; no document need be signed, as the mere act of summoning a demon constituted an implied pact. Tens of thousands of trials continued through Europe generation after generation; William Shakespeare wrote about the infamous \\"Three Witches\\" in his tragedy Macbeth during the reign of James I, who was notorious for his ruthless prosecution of witchcraft. Accusations against witches were almost identical to those levelled by 3rd-century pagans against early Christians: The craze took on new strength in the 15th century, and in 1486, Heinrich Kramer, a member of the Dominican Order, published the Malleus Maleficarum (the 'Hammer against the Witches'). This book was banned by the Church in 1490 and scholars are unclear on just how influential the Malleus was in its day. Less than one hundred years after it was written, the Council of the Inquisitor General in Spain discounted the credibility of the Malleus since it contained numerous errors. Persecution continued through the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, and the Protestants and Catholics both continued witch trials with varying numbers of executions from one period to the next. The \\"Caroline Code\\", the basic law code of the Holy Roman Empire (1532) imposed heavy penalties on witchcraft. As society became more literate (due mostly to the invention of the printing press in the 1440s), increasing numbers of books and tracts fueled the witch fears. The craze reached its height between 1560 and 1660. After 1580, the Jesuits replaced the Dominicans as the chief Catholic witch- hunters, and the Catholic Rudolf II (1576‚Äì1612) presided over a long persecution in Austria. The Jura Mountains in southern Germany provided a small respite from the insanity; there, torture was imposed only within the precise limits of the Caroline Code of 1532, little attention was paid to the accusations of or by children, and charges had to be brought openly before a suspect could be arrested. These limitations contained the mania in that area. The nuns of Loudun (1630), novelized by Aldous Huxley and made into a film by Ken Russell, provide an example of the craze during this time. The nuns had conspired to accuse Father Urbain Grandier of witchcraft by faking symptoms of possession and torment; they feigned convulsions, rolled and gibbered on the ground, and accused Grandier of indecencies. Grandier was convicted and burned; however, after the plot succeeded, the symptoms of the nuns only grew worse, and they became more and more sexual in nature. This attests to the degree of mania and insanity present in such witch trials. In 1687, Louis XIV issued an edict against witchcraft that was rather moderate compared to former ones; it ignored black cats and other lurid fantasies of the witch mania. After 1700, the number of witches accused and condemned fell rapidly. Witchcraft in Britain James VI, from his Daemonologie (1597) In England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland there was a succession of Witchcraft Acts starting with Henry VIII's Act of 1542. They governed witchcraft and providing penalties for its practice, or‚Äîafter 1700‚Äîrather for pretending to practise it. In Wales, fear of witchcraft mounted around the year 1500. There was a growing alarm of women's magic as a weapon aimed against the state and church. The Church made greater efforts to enforce the canon law of marriage, especially in Wales where tradition allowed a wider range of sexual partnerships. There was a political dimension as well, as accusations of witchcraft were levied against the enemies of Henry VII, who was exerting more and more control over Wales.Kathleen Kamerick, \\"Tanglost of Wales: Magic and Adultery in the Court of Chancery circa 1500\\". Sixteenth Century Journal 44#1 (2013) pp25-45. The records of the Courts of Great Sessions for Wales, 1536‚Äì1736 show that Welsh custom was more important than English law. Custom provided a framework of responding to witches and witchcraft in such a way that interpersonal and communal harmony was maintained, Showing to regard to the importance of honour, social place and cultural status. Even when found guilty, execution did not occur. Becoming king in 1603, James I brought to England and Scotland continental explanations of witchcraft. He set out the much stiffer Witchcraft Act of 1604, which made it a felony under common law. One goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus fear on female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil. Enlightenment attitudes after 1700 made a mockery of beliefs in witches. The Witchcraft Act of 1735 marked a complete reversal in attitudes. Penalties for the practice of witchcraft as traditionally constituted, which by that time was considered by many influential figures to be an impossible crime, were replaced by penalties for the pretence of witchcraft. A person who claimed to have the power to call up spirits, or foretell the future, or cast spells, or discover the whereabouts of stolen goods, was to be punished as a vagrant and a con artist, subject to fines and imprisonment. Hallucinogens and witchcraft Recognition A number of modern researchers have recognized the importance of hallucinogenic plants in the practice of European witchcraft; among them, anthropologists Edward B. Taylor, Bernard Barnett, Michael J. Harner and Julio C. BarojaBaroja, Julio C., (1964) The World of the Witches. University of Chicago Press. and pharmacologists Louis LewinLewin, Louis.

Library of Congress: 72-92292. p. 128‚Äì50 Much of our knowledge of herbalism in European witchcraft comes from the Spanish Inquisitors and other authorities, who occasionally recognized the psychological nature of the \\"witches' flight\\", but more often considered the effects of witches' ointments to be demonic or satanic. Use patterns belladonna Decoctions of deliriant nightshades (such as henbane, belladonna, mandrake, or datura) were used in European witchcraft. All of these plants contain hallucinogenic alkaloids of the tropane family, including hyoscyamine, atropine and scopolamine ‚Äîthe last of which is unique in that it can be absorbed through the skin. These concoctions are described in the literature variously as brews, salves, ointments, philtres, oils, and unguents. Ointments were mainly applied by rubbing on the skin, especially in sensitive areas‚Äîunderarms, the pubic region,Murray, Margaret. 1962. The Witch-Cult in Western Europe. Oxford University Press. the forehead, the mucous membranes of the vagina and anus, or on areas rubbed raw ahead of time. They were often first applied to a \\"vehicle\\" to be \\"ridden\\" (an object such as a broom, pitchfork, basket, or animal skin that was rubbed against sensitive skin). All of these concoctions were made and used for the purpose of giving the witch special abilities to commune with spirits, transform into animals (lycanthropy),Boguet, Henry (transl. Ashwin, E. Allen). 1929. An Examen of Witches. gain love, harm enemies, experience euphoria and sexual pleasure, and‚Äîimportantly‚Äîto \\"fly to the witches' Sabbath\\". Position of the church Illustration by Martin van Ma√´le, of a Witches' Sabbath, in the 1911 edition of La Sorci√®re by Jules Michelet Witches were not localised Christian distortions of pagans but people alleged to have both the ability and the will to employ supernatural effects for malignant ends. This belief is familiar from other cultures, and was partly inherited from paganism. The belief that witches were originally purely benign does not derive from any early textual source. However, the view of witches as malignant did stem from blatant misogyny of the time. The earliest written reference to witches as such, from √Ülfric's homilies,http://www.ealdriht.org/witchcraft.html portrays them as malign. The tendency to perceive them as healers begins only in the 19th century, with Jules Michelet whose novel La Sorci√®re, published in 1862, first postulated a benign witch. It was in the Church's interest, as it expanded, to suppress all competing Pagan methodologies of magic. This could be done only by presenting a cosmology in which Christian miracles were legitimate and credible, whereas non-Christian ones were \\"of the devil\\". Hence the following law: While the common people were aware of the difference between witches, who they considered willing to undertake evil actions, such as cursing, and cunning folk who avoided involvement in such activities, the Church attempted to blot out the distinction. In much the same way that culturally distinct non-Christian religions were all lumped together and termed merely \\"Pagan\\", so too was all magic lumped together as equally sinful and abhorrent. The Demonologie of James I explicitly condemns all magic-workers as equally guilty of the same crime against God. des vaudoises\\" in Le champion des dames, by Martin Le France, 1451 \\"Witch\\" stock character Sabbath gatherings from the chronicles of Johann Jakob Wick The characterization of the witch in Europe is not derived from a single source. The familiar witch of folklore and popular superstition is a combination of numerous influences. At the end of the Middle Ages, the recurring beliefs about witches were: The Malleus Maleficarum (1486) declared that the four essential points of witchcraft were renunciation of the Catholic faith, devotion of body and soul to evil, offering up unbaptized children to the Devil, and engaging in orgies that included intercourse with the Devil; in addition, witches were accused of shifting their shapes, flying through the air, abusing Christian sacraments, and confecting magical ointments. Witches were credited with a variety of magical powers. These fall into two broad categories: those that explain the occurrence of misfortune and are thus grounded in real events, and those that are wholly fantastic. The first category includes the powers to cause impotence, to turn milk sour, to strike people dead, to cause diseases, to raise storms, to cause infants to be stillborn, to prevent cows from giving milk, to prevent hens from laying and to blight crops. The second includes the power to fly in the air, to change form into a hare, to suckle familiar spirits from warts, to sail on a single plank and perhaps most absurd of all, to go to sea in an eggshell. Witches were often believed to fly on broomsticks or distaffs, or occasionally upon unwilling human beings, who would be called 'hag-ridden'. Horses found sweating in their stalls in the morning were also said to be hag-ridden. The accused witch Isobel Gowdie gave the following charm as her means of transmuting herself into a hare: Painting by William Rimmer depicting the Three Witches from William Shakespeare's Macbeth Especially in media aimed at children (such as fairy tales), witches are often depicted as wicked old women with wrinkled skin and pointy hats, clothed in black or purple, with warts on their noses and sometimes long claw-like fingernails. Like the Three Witches from Macbeth, they are often portrayed as concocting potions in large cauldrons. Witches typically ride through the air on a broomstick as in the Harry Potter universe or in more modern spoof versions, a vacuum cleaner as in the Hocus Pocus universe. They are often accompanied by black cats. One of the most famous modern depictions is the Wicked Witch of the West, in L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Witches also appear as villains in many 19th- and 20th-century fairy tales, folk tales and children's stories, such as \\"Snow White\\", \\"Hansel and Gretel\\", \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", and many other stories recorded by the Brothers Grimm. Such folktales typically portray witches as either remarkably ugly hags or remarkably beautiful young women. In the novel by Fernando de Rojas, Celestina is an old prostitute who commits pimping and witchcraft in order to arrange sexual relationships. Witches may also be depicted as essentially good, as in Archie Comics' long running Sabrina the Teenage Witch series, Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, in Hayao Miyazaki's 1989 film Kiki's Delivery Service, or the television series Charmed (1998‚Äì2006). Following the film The Craft, popular fictional depictions of witchcraft have increasingly drawn from Wiccan practices, portraying witchcraft as having a religious basis and witches as humans of normal appearance.

Early career Malling-Hansen developed his Hansen Writing Ball further throughout the 1870s and '80s, and in 1874 he patented a new model jointly in which the cylinder was replaced by a flat carriage on which the paper was fastened. In 1875, the writing ball found its well-known tall shape. With this model, he found a mechanical solution for the movement of the paper, dispensing with the battery. The writing ball was sold in many countries in Europe, but probably due to the relatively high price, it was never a great commercial success. Even so, it was a great success in different exhibitions, Malling-Hansen and Halll, received the first prize medal at a large industrial exhibition in Copenhagen in 1872, and at the world exhibitions in Vienna in 1873, as well as in Paris in 1878. That year Malling-Hansen developed a fast speed writing machine to be used for stenography, called the Takygraf. Malling-Hansen was also the first person to discover the unique possibilities of blue carbon paper, and developed a copying technique he called the Xerografi. It could, in a relatively short time, produce up to one hundred copies of letters and drawings. Education career Malling-Hansen's period as a principal at the Royal Institute for the Deaf, from 1865 to 1890, was a period of change and new ideas. Malling-Hansen very soon understood that the teaching of deaf-mutes was ineffective because of the large variation of the pupils' abilities. Some of them were totally deaf and had no speech ability, and some were what we today would call mentally retarded. Others had a slight hearing ability, and could also speak. From Malling-Hansen came, in 1867, a proposal to divide the pupils into 3 different groups, depending on their abilities. Malling-Hansen also saw to it that the newest pedagogical method, the speech method (reading of the lips) was put into use for the group called the not originally deaf; those who had a limited hearing ability and could also speak. The sign method was still to be used when teaching the group called the originally deaf, those who had no hearing ability and no language, and the mentally retarded. Together with the Keller Institutions, the Royal Institute divided these groups between them. The Institute was to educate the originally deaf, and the Keller Institutions the not originally deaf and the mentally retarded. Rasmus Malling-Hansen in 1887. Malling-Hansen also wanted to improve the conditions under which the deaf-mutes lived. This was in a very early stage of the educational system, and the understanding of children's needs to play and to relax was not very developed. They had to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning, and in addition to the teaching they had to work in the workshops of the school in late hours. The death rate was extreme, and in the first period of the Institute, from 1824 until 1839, one-third of all the children died, mostly of lung diseases. Malling-Hansen understood that the main reason for the lung diseases, was the lack of space in the school - there were too many children in a too small area. He therefore came up with the proposal to set up a new building, and also to install electricity, but unfortunately both proposals were refused by the authorities. But Malling-Hansen made sure to take into use all possible areas of the school, and he made improvements and enlarged the outside garden, and all children regularly worked with gardening, the girls more than the boys, as things were in those days. In Malling- Hansen's time as principal, the death rate sunk drastically among the children, and in the last periods of his time the death rate was lower than in the similar population of hearing children. In 1879 Malling-Hansen made a proposal to establish a new Institute in Jylland, and this time his plans were realized, and in 1881 the Royal Institute for the Deaf-mutes in Fredericia was founded. Malling-Hansen was a man who had great impact on the development of the Danish and also the Nordic educational system of his time. He was often used in public committees, and in 1890, shortly before his death, he held a lecture about the development of the education of the deaf-mutes on a large inter-Nordic conference in Copenhagen. His care and concern for the deaf children, who were among the weakest of the society, was unique, and they showed their appreciation by attending his funeral in 1890 in great numbers. They had lost a father figure and a true friend. Discoverer of the growth of children in periods An old picture of Malling-Hansen's tombstone in Garrisons churchyard in Copenhagen. In 1947 the stone was moved to his old school. At a certain point Malling-Hansen wanted to investigate whether the growth and the increase in weight were satisfactory among the children at the Institute. With his usual thoroughness he started a scientific investigation, which included several weighings and measurings of the children's height every day. To shorten the time needed to perform the weighings, Malling-Hansen had some large weights made, where he could weigh up to ten children at the time. The results soon showed him that the growth of the children was not a constantly ongoing process throughout all the year, but that the children grew in periods, and this was totally unknown to science up until then. Malling- Hansen saw that the growth was affected by some unknown factor, and he also started measurements of trees, and here he found again the same factor. He also was in contact with scientists around the world, who reported their results from different measuring projects initiated by Malling-Hansen. There were still many unanswered questions to investigate further when Malling- Hansen died, but in 1886 he published a book where he presented the results of his studies. The book was called Perioder i B√∏rns V√¶kst og i Solens Varme, and here he presented his idea, that the factor that caused the variations in the growth of the children and in nature as such in some way was related to the variations in the heat of the sun. His discoveries became well known not only in Denmark, but also internationally, and his book was also translated into German. In 1884 he had also held a lecture on a scientific conference in Copenhagen, attended by scientists from all over the world. Malling-Hansen did not become an old man. He worked extremely hard all his life, from the time he attended the Jonstrup school for teachers in 1852, during his theological education, in his work at the Institute, and with his inventions and scientific studies. He was married in 1865 to the daughter of the former principal, Cathrine Heiberg, and he became the father of seven daughters. His first wife was giving birth to two more daughters in 1876, when both she and the twin girls died. Malling-Hansen remarried in 1880, to a woman he knew from his youth, Anna Steenstrup. He was also a freemason, and was known to always have an open door to everyone who wanted to see him, for he was a man of a good and friendly heart. He was an internationally known inventor and scientist when he died, on his way home from a meeting in his lodge, in a dark autumn night in 1890. One of Malling-Hansen's daughters, Johanne Agerskov, together with her husband, Michael Agerskov, in 1920 published a religious, ethical and philosophical book, called Toward the Light.

Features OSAs are often characterized by a higher interest rate or lower fees, compared with traditional savings accounts. Many of these high-yield accounts have no minimum balance. Account holders may link their OSAs to their existing external bank accounts for easy transfer of funds between multiple accounts. Some also offer ATM cards so customers can directly access the funds in their OSAs. Deposits and withdrawals Some banks offering OSA's may not have bank branches and a customer may deposit funds into their account by either ACH transfer, mailing in a cheque, or direct deposit. To withdraw money, customers can initiate an ACH transfer into another account or sometimes request a check from the bank in the desired amount. Changes in banking and investing OSAs, combined with rising interest rates, have made cash an increasingly attractive investment option. They provide a relatively low risk option for investors looking for a place to park their money, especially in uncertain economic times. Inflation, stagflation, recessionary fears and stock market volatility are among the economic indicators that have encouraged more and more investors to consider cash as a way to balance their portfolios. In fact, more than 8.5 million customers signed up for OSAs with leading U.S. banks in 2005 alone, and some industry experts estimated the online savings account market would triple in size, from $250 billion to $400 billion by 2010.comScore Networks Boston Consulting Group See also * Direct bank * Online banking Specific examples: * HSBC Direct * ING Direct  Notes  Category:Online banking ","title":"Online savings account"},{"id":"7209569","text":"Maccabi World Union is an international Jewish sports organisation spanning five continents and more than 50 countries, with some 400,000 members. The Maccabi World Union organises the Maccabiah Games, a prominent international Jewish athletics event. The organisation comprises six confederations: Maccabi Israel, European Maccabi confederation, confederation Maccabi North America, confederation Maccabi Latin America, Maccabi South Africa, and Maccabi Australia. Etymology The movement is named after the Maccabees (Hebrew: ◊û◊õ◊ë◊ô◊ù or ◊û◊ß◊ë◊ô◊ù, Makabim) who were a Jewish national liberation movement that fought for and won independence from Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Ironically, at the time the Maccabees were staunchly opposed to athletic competitions, part of the Hellenizing cultural tendencies which they opposed. Athletic competitions held in Jerusalem under the Seleucid rule were terminated once the Maccabees took over the city. However, the modern Zionists who took up the name were mainly interested in the Maccabees as militant Jewish heroes whose example Zionism sought to emulate. History First Jewish tourist mountain hostel Makkabi Bielsko 1929 on Hala Boracza As early as the 19th century, Jewish sports clubs were founded in Eastern and Central Europe. The first club was the Israelite Gymnastic Association Constantinople () founded in 1895 in Istanbul, Turkey by Jews of German and Austrian extraction who had been rejected from participating in other social sport clubs. Two years later, haGibor was formed in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, and 1898 saw the founding of Bar Kochba Berlin along with Viv√≥ √©s Athletikai Club in Budapest, Hungary. Other clubs that followed were named after ‚ÄúBar Kochba‚Äù or Hebrew names such as ‚ÄúHakoah‚Äù or ‚ÄúHagibor‚Äù that symbolized strength and heroism. One of the basic premises behind the founding of these clubs was Jewish Nationalism, and specifically \\"Muscular Judaism\\". The concept was that Jews were not only a religious entity, but also one based on a common historical and social background, having special cultural and psychological concepts that have been preserved to this day, resulting in a strong recognition of collective belonging. Maccabi boxing club, Tunisia, 1923 Maccabi youth movement in 1949 At Krakow, Poland there was during the interwar period a deep animosity between the locally-based Makkabi Krak√≥w club and the rival Jewish club Jutrzenka Krak√≥w, associated with the Bund political party. While both clubs shared in the above aspiration to demonstrate a Jewish physical strength, they had divergent political programs - the one sharing in the Zionist aspiration of creating a Jewish state in Palestine, while the other was oriented to the Bundist program of Jewish cultural autonomy in Europe. This political opposition exacerbated their athletic rivalry between fans and players, to the point that matches between the two teams were generally referred to as a \\"Holy War\\". In 1906, the first Jewish gymnastics club was formed in Palestine. Clubs later would spring up in other cities. By 1912, all of them joined the Maccabi Federation of Israel. That same year, the first relations were established between them and their European counterparts, when a decision was taken at the Maccabi Conference in Berlin to begin group trips to Palestine. Maccabi GB is a member of the English National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS)Full list of NCVYS members because of its work promoting the personal and social development of young people. The Maccabi World Union was created at the 12th World Jewish Congress in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia in 1921. It was then decided by the secretariat of Jewish sport leaders to form one umbrella organization for all Jewish sports associations. Its aims were defined as working \\"foster physical education, belief in Jewish heritage and the Jewish nation, and to work actively for the rebuilding of our own country and for the preservation of our people\\". In 1960, the International Olympic Committee officially recognized the Maccabi World Union as an \\"Organization of Olympic Standing\\".

Published by Simon & Schuster in 1986, it describes the actions of a group of U.S. federal government officials and members of the East Coast foreign policy establishment. Starting in the immediate post-World War II period, the group developed the containment policy of dealing with the Communist bloc during the Cold War. They also helped to craft institutions and initiatives such as NATO, the World Bank, and the Marshall Plan. An updated edition of the book was released in 2012, a \\"Quicklet\\" summary of the book being distributed as well. Supportive reviews appeared in publications such as Foreign Affairs and The Los Angeles Times. Members of the group The book identifies six people who were important foreign policy advisors to U.S. Presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Lyndon Johnson and were influential in the development of Cold War era foreign policy for America. The six are: * Dean Acheson, Secretary of State under President Harry Truman * Charles E. Bohlen, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the Philippines, and France * W. Averell Harriman, Special Envoy for President Franklin Roosevelt * George F. Kennan, Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, State Dept. Director of Policy Planning * Robert A. Lovett, Truman's Secretary of Defense * John J. McCloy, a War Department official and later U.S. High Commissioner for Germany. The group comprised two lawyers, two bankers, and two diplomats. Five of the six were from the so- called Georgetown Set. Acheson, Harriman, and Lovett had known each other since their days at prep school or college and on Wall Street. Bohlen, Kennan and McCloy were younger and did not know the others well until their public lives brought them into close contact. Most of these men, Lovett and McCloy in particular, were strongly influenced by Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Elihu Root, Stimson's mentor, is often regarded as the prototypical \\"wise man.\\" Influence They coalesced as a group when Truman became President in 1945 and greatly needed advice on foreign policy, as he knew very little in that area. The group helped to create a bipartisan foreign policy based on resistance to the expansion of Soviet power. The authors describe them as the hidden architects behind the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and Cold War containment. Kennan, in particular, is regarded as \\"the father of containment.\\" The book portrays them as personifying an ideal of statesmanship marked by nonpartisanship, pragmatic internationalism, and aversion to ideological fervor. They tended to be practical, realistic, and nonideological. After the six had retired from public life, they and other like-minded establishment elders were dubbed The Wise Men. In 1967 and 1968, Johnson summoned them and a few others (including General Omar Bradley) to advise him on foreign policy, particularly the Vietnam War. In November 1967, they unanimously recommended staying in Vietnam, but in a pivotal second meeting in March 1968, most said the war could not be won and American troops should be withdrawn. Legacy Later public figures, such as Clark Clifford, James A. Baker III, and Robert S. Strauss are sometimes evaluated by comparing them to these \\"wise men\\". Reviews Excerpts *\\"A sober and straightforward account of what actually happened and why... In this context the book does a great service.

United Empire Loyalists and more recent arrivals from England and the U.S. formed the core and foundation of the Baptist denomination in Canada.Robert S. Wilson, \\"Patterns of Canadian Baptist Life in the Twentieth Century,\\" Baptist History & Heritage (2001) 36# 1/2, pp 27-60. Statistics and changes According to the Canada 2001 Census, the number of people in Canada who identify themselves as Baptist is 729,470, about 2.5% of the population, an increase of about 10% in the 10 years since the 1991 census (see Religion in Canada). A growing practice of existing and new churches in Canada and the United States is the dropping of the term \\"Baptist\\" from their church's name. Often, this practice is due to concern over what is perceived within the church to be a negative stereotype by the general population toward the label \\"Baptist\\", but not toward the church or Baptist beliefs in general. This negative stereotype has often been perceived legalism, associated with the word \\"baptist\\". Churches who make this change are interested in attracting people who are unchurched, and who may have barriers with becoming affiliated with a denomination, or specifically becoming a \\"baptist\\". Keeping the distinct name and simply adding Community Church to the end is a common change. A name such as \\"Grace Community Church\\" is felt by these churches to be less likely to cause unnecessary negative stereotypes or offence, to signal and inspire a change in the mindset and vision of the church, and to fit in with the surrounding community better. In some congregations, this change has been a source of controversy, and has not been easily accepted by some, especially older members. The most common arguments with this type of \\"rebranding\\" are 1) it is deceptive to the public, 2) it is an abandoning of Baptist history, 3) it might lead a church to eventually compromise and abandon their Baptist beliefs in order to be more inclusive, and 4) it may make it more difficult to determine the number of \\"Baptist\\" churches and those believing in the \\"Baptist distinctives\\". History Baptist missionary work began on the Atlantic coast in the 1760s but took around 100 years to reach the west coast. The first official record of a Baptist church in Canada was that of the Horton Baptist Church (now Wolfville) in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on October 29, 1778. The church was established with the assistance of the New Light evangelist Henry Alline. Many of Alline's followers, after his death, would convert and strengthen the Baptist presence in the Atlantic region.Bell, D.G. Henry Alline and Maritime Religion. Canadian Historical Association, Ottawa, 1993. Two major groups of Baptists formed the basis of the churches in the maritimes. These were referred to as Regular Baptist (Calvinistic in their doctrine) and Free Will Baptists. The first congregations organized in Central Canada were at Beamsville, Ontario as early as 1776 and in 1794 at Caldwell's Manor (now Saint-Georges-de-Clarenceville, Quebec). Shortly thereafter churches were organized at Hallowell, Ontario (1795) and Haldimand Township (see Alnwick/Haldimand). These were Regular Baptist congregations. Churches which were in agreement began to group together into associations in order to work together for achieving common goals. A variety of associations and affiliations have occurred since then. Eventually these associations joined together to form a convention. The centre for Baptist influence and mission work in Canada began to be firmly established in Toronto after 1848. (See Bond Street Baptist Church). Many of the original churches were established by specific missionary groups from the United States of America and by various ethnic or language groups, such as the Swedish Baptist Churches (Baptist General Conference of Canada), North American Baptist Conference (German background), and the Ukrainian Evangelical Baptist Convention of Canada.E. R. Fitch, ed., The Baptists of Canada (Toronto, 1911) Three significant shifts in associations have occurred, between 1905 and 1906, in 1927, and in 1953. From 1905 to 1906, the United Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces formed from the union of the Maritime Convention of Maritime Baptists, the Free Baptists of New Brunswick, and the Free Baptists of Nova Scotia.Daniel C. Goodwin, \\"Maritime Baptist Union and the Power of Regionalism.\\" Journal of Ecumenical Studies 41.2 (2004): 125+ The Union of Regular Baptist Churches was formed in 1927 in Hamilton, Ontario by 77 churches who had withdrawn from the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec (BCOQ). This withdrawal was due to the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy, centred on a professor at the Convention's official seminary at McMaster University, who held a liberal/modernist position of theology. In 1944, the BCOQ joined with the United Baptist Convention of the Maritimes and the Baptist Union of Western Canada to form the first national Canadian Baptist association, the Canadian Baptist Federation. In 1995, they merged with the Canadian Baptist International Ministries to form Canadian Baptist Ministries. The four conventions still exist within the association and counted over 1100 member churches in 1995. By 1953 some churches had dropped out of the Union of Regular Baptist Churches, but the remainder joined with the Fellowship of Independent Baptist Churches (founded 1933) and formed the Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada (FEBC). The Regular Baptist Missionary Fellowship of Alberta joined in 1963 and the Convention of Regular Baptist Churches of British Columbia (founded 1927) also joined in 1965. Known as \\"The Fellowship\\", it claims to be the largest evangelical group in Canada, with at least 500 member churches in Canada from coast to coast. A Regular Baptist church in British Columbia joined a Southern Baptist Convention affiliate in 1953. The first SBC association was formed in 1955 and there are now 233 churches, in most provinces and territories, with the largest concentration in western Canada.Callum Jones, \\"Western Canadian Baptists and the Southern Baptist 'invasion' of the 1950s.\\" Baptist Quarterly (2014) 45#7 pp 413-429.

He is the head of the crime lab, under the rank of Lieutenant of the MDPD. Fictional character biography Horatio Caine formerly worked in New York City as a detective with the NYPD, much like Caruso's NYPD Blue character Det. John Kelly, before moving to Miami. In 1995 he was stabbed while investigating a case in which children were locked in closets while their parents were murdered. The perpetrator, Walter Resden, harbored a grudge against Horatio, collecting the blood from the stabbing and preserving it for 10 years in order to frame him for the murder of Horatio's girlfriend, Rachel Turner. After his arrival in Florida, Horatio joined the Miami-Dade Police as a homicide detective but later transferred to the bomb squad, where he was mentored by Al Humphries, an older cop whom Horatio respected and considered a good friend. Humphries was killed after accidentally triggering a bomb he was attempting to disarm. Horatio worked undercover as \\"John Walden\\" in Pensacola, Florida for some time during the early 1990s. During his time there, he dated a woman he believed to be named Julia Eberlie, and the two conceived a son named Kyle. Horatio was not aware of Kyle's existence for another 16 years. Sometime later he returned to Miami and to being a detective. In the episode \\"Out of Time\\" he references previously working on the bomb squad. Finally, Horatio moved to the crime lab, accepting a promotion to lieutenant, which earned him the animosity of Sergeant Rick Stetler, who was also vying for the position. When veteran CSI Megan Donner went on personal leave following the death of her husband, Horatio became the permanent head of the lab. In early seasons, Horatio frequently confirms his dedication to the job with the catchphrase \\"We Never Close\\", an homage to the Pinkerton Agency. Horatio is known for wearing sunglasses (known by fans as the 'Shades of Justice'); one of his trademarks is to put them on prior to making a dramatic remark. In season 8, it is revealed that this style of sunglasses were originally a gift from Eric Delko in 1997. In season 4, Horatio began a romantic relationship with Marisol Delko (Eric's sister). Horatio and Marisol got married and she was killed by the end of season 4. In the season nine finale, Horatio is shot down by Randy North, the unwilling accomplice of convicted felon Jack Toller, who also kidnaps Horatio's co-worker Natalia Boa Vista and puts her in the trunk of a car and pushes it off the pier. In the tenth-season premiere, Horatio manages to save Natalia and, with the team, captures Toller. Head of the day shift crime lab In the CSI continuum, Horatio is a day shift supervisor at the Miami- Dade crime lab, a forensic analyst and former homicide detective and bomb squad officer (his forensic specialty is arson and explosion evidence). He is very protective of his team, who affectionately call him \\"H\\". He is very concerned about the reputation of his lab, and takes great care to keep them clean, likely because of his experience with his tarnished younger brother, Ray. When his staff fall under suspicion in several episodes (\\"One of Our Own\\", \\"Internal Affairs\\"), he immediately jumps in their defense, especially from IA investigator Rick Stetler, and tries his best to prove their innocence. Unlike his counterpart in Las Vegas, now former CSI Supervisor Gil Grissom (CSI: Crime Scene Investigation), he is a sworn police officer, and thus carries a badge and gun. A superb marksman, Horatio doesn't hesitate to use deadly force when the situation calls for it. He is also an ardent advocate of the death penalty for particularly heinous crimes, and doesn't think twice about threatening suspects with it in such cases. He is also known to reserve an especially deep wrath for those who would dare to harm children. Horatio is truly egalitarian, treating all victims and their families equally, regardless of their ethnicity, background, or economic station. He often goes out of his way to ensure they are alright during the course of a case, especially when it involves a child, frequently giving his number to them, stating that he is available day or night to take their call. On top of providing himself with a comfortable living, Horatio has helped others financially with such expensive things as providing private funeral arrangements for an indigent murder victim, rent and living expenses for his brother Ray's mistress and his niece, as well as medical costs for his niece's cancer treatment, purchasing an apartment for his son Kyle, despite being a civil servant on a county wage. This is likely due to a number of extremely shrewd financial decisions and deals Horatio made over the years leading up to the series. Past events In the first two seasons, Horatio carries a Beretta Cougar on the job. Since the beginning of season three, he has been shown carrying a SIG Sauer P229. He is very insistent on gun maintenance, especially since team member Tim Speedle was killed in a shootout after his gun misfired because of his lax maintenance. In fact, one of the reasons for Horatio's nearly on-the-spot selection of Officer Ryan Wolfe as Tim Speedle's replacement (in episode 303, \\"Under the Influence\\") is Wolfe's compulsive care of his firearm due to OCD. He is later forced to fire Wolfe, as the younger CSI compromised himself during the course of the investigation due to his gambling debts and lack of honesty regarding the situation (episode 522, \\"Burned\\"). Wolfe also previously violated protocol. Horatio indicates a willingness to allow Wolfe to redeem himself, however, and possibly allow him to return to the team after reviewing all the files from his previous cases (episode 523, \\"Kill Switch\\"). At the end of Season 2 (episode 223, \\"MIA/NYC ‚Äî Nonstop\\"), Horatio travels to New York City in pursuit of a murder suspect and meets Detective Mac Taylor and his team, inaugurating the first season of CSI: NY. Horatio later reunites with Mac and the New York CSIs to track down and arrest the murderer, Henry Darius, who would be extradited to Florida to face the death penalty (CSI: Miami episode 407, \\"Felony Flight,\\" CSI: NY episode 207, \\"Manhattan Manhunt\\"). This appearance would make Horatio Caine the first character to appear at least once in all three CSI shows. He has many recurring enemies throughout the series, from serial killer Walter Resden to abusive internal affairs agent Rick Stetler to corrupt judge Joseph Ratner. Some he thought had been put away for good come back to haunt him. Clavo Cruz, serving a life sentence for murdering a woman (episode 201, \\"Blood Brothers,\\" episode 315, \\"Identity\\"), escapes custody in a dramatic rocket attack on a courthouse (superficially injuring coroner Alexx Woods). Cruz then kidnaps a court stenographer and forces Horatio to bring him $1 million in exchange for her location. It is all a set-up, however, and Horatio and Delko are ambushed on the roof of a parking garage. Though Horatio shoots down one man and escapes without injury, Delko is critically wounded even as Horatio fires at the fleeing gunmen (episode 514, \\"No Man's Land\\"). Horatio eventually forces Cruz out of hiding by removing all his avenues of escape. Cruz approaches Horatio outside the Miami-Dade Crime Lab, and Horatio kills Clavo with a single shot to the chest (episode 515, \\"Man Down\\"). In episode 302 (\\"Pro Per\\"), Yelina's house was shot but she and Ray jr were unharmed because previously Horatio had warned of them. The attackers were captured and although the danger had passed, Horatio offered her to stay out all night watching the house but Yelina said him that it wasn't necessary. In that moment, to Horatio's surprise, Rick Stetler leaves the house with Ray Jr. Horatio was deeply disappointed. In episode 406 (\\"Under Suspicion\\"), Rachel Turner, Horatio's girlfriend, is murdered. He is suspected of the murder because he was the last person to see the victim alive. Later, the true killer was found, he was Walter Resden, an old enemy of Horatio. In the episode 412 (\\"The Score\\"), Marisol Delko invited Horatio to have dinner but he refused at first, because she had just been cleared in a drug investigation and he, as head of the lab, could be put under scrutinity. He ended up accepting the invitation, and the two later started their relationship. Horatio finds himself targeted by the son of Argento, a crime lord whom he helped put in jail some years earlier. After the young man vandalizes Horatio's vehicle, then smugly denies culpability; he then shoots the Lieutenant. However, the rounds from his gun were replaced with blanks, Horatio leaves without injury and the son is arrested afterward (episode 602, \\"Cyber-lebrity\\"). In the episode \\"Bone Voyage\\", when Raymond Langston comes to help Horatio and his team, he mentions deceased CSI Warrick Brown and asks Langston to tell Catherine Willows that he is sorry for their loss. Recent events In the end of the Season 8 finale, Horatio receives a shocking message from the man he arrested. The message said: \\"THEY ALL FALL DOWN\\". In the Season 9 premiere, he rushes to the crime lab, fearing for the team's lives. When he got out of the elevator, he finds everyone down and Eric barely conscious. Eric tells him to shoot the windows out for oxygen. After Horatio does so, everyone gets back to their feet, except for Jesse Cardoza, who dies from his fall to the floor. Horatio then tries to comfort the devastated Natalia, who unsuccessfully attempted to revive Cardoza. Horatio finds the killer, and then joins the team on a game of basketball, in honor of Cardoza. In \\"See No Evil\\" a large prison break occurs and one of the inmates, Joe LeBrock, states that they were planning on targeting Horatio. In the episode \\"Manhunt\\", he and the team track down Memmo Fierro, the man who was serving time for killing Marisol (Horatio's wife and Eric's sister) after he is one of the eight people who broke out in the previous episode. Memmo (under orders of Antonio Riaz of the Mala Noche) had shot Marisol, then blocked the ambulance, trying to get Horatio to come out, forcing the ambulance to drive over a center median. At the hospital, a doctor states that the car was worse than the bullet. Both the shooting and the blocking proved fatal to Marisol. At the end of the episode, Memmo takes a hostage, his daughter's social worker. Eric has a clear shot of him, but Horatio tells him not to shoot him in front of Memmo's daughter. After Memmo sees his daughter, he leaves with the hostage, who is later found dead. In \\"Happy Birthday\\", Horatio is seen driving at the beginning of the episode with a bouquet of flowers on the passenger seat and leaves Eric a message on his phone asking him to take over from him for a while so he can run an errand. He is distracted by a pedestrian, who informs him a pregnant woman has been assaulted on the side of the road. Leaving his errand behind, he helps the woman and spends the rest of the episode looking for the people who did this to her, while the mother and the baby are fighting for their life back in the hospital. At the end of the episode, the mother gives birth to a baby girl, and her husband is arrested because he did not want her to have the baby and rigged the car to so that she would hit the steering wheel in her midsection during a staged car accident & force a miscarriage. We see Horatio at Marisol's grave; he tells her the baby is \\"beautiful, just like you\\". He then wishes her 'happy birthday'. Marisol's murder caused him a big feeling of guilt because he couldn't protect her and that idea obsessed him a long time after her death. In \\"Last Stand\\", Memmo returns with a gang of drug cartels, and Horatio lays a trap for him, alone. Horatio kicks Memmo multiple times and holds him at gunpoint. Memmo states to him that killing his wife was not personal, but Horatio responds that it was to him. Memmo asks if what Caine is doing is \\"righteous\\" and if he is at peace with his decision. Horatio responds that he is, and places him under arrest, and waits for backup to arrive. In \\"Crowned\\", Horatio does not help a kidnapper, who kidnapped a girl who participated in a child's beauty pageants, and lets him fall off the edge at an abandoned movie theater, after shooting him (not fatally). Over recent years and presumably due to the fact that he was left gravely injured after being shot, Horatio has become more aggressive than usual when it comes to dealing with suspects and he has been seen on at least two occasions apparently assaulting a suspect in a locked room (the actual assault is only implied as it takes place off camera). In both these cases the suspect was accused of abuse (one child molestation, the other domestic violence). Further evidence of this can be found in the season 8 episode \\"Kill Clause\\", the ending of which implies that Horatio has sanctioned the murder of a corrupt CEO who had his employees murdered for their life insurance. Reception The character of Horatio Caine received very positive feedback from critics, with Caruso's performance as the character being the most praised. Horatio gathered a cult following as well. On an episode of the Late Show with David Letterman that aired on March 8, 2007, comedian Jim Carrey professed to being a fan of the show and went on to satirically impersonate Caruso's character, which received praise from Caruso.

D'Aquisto (Brooklyn, November 9, 1935 ‚Äì California, April 17, 1995) was an Italian‚ÄìAmerican luthier who concentrated on building and repairing archtop guitars. He served as an apprentice to John D'Angelico beginning in 1952 and later developed his own distinctive style. Career James D'Aquisto was born on November 9, 1935 into a musical Italian family. An aspiring jazz guitarist he visited luthier John D'Angelico's shop in 1951 which lead to him in 1952 becoming his apprentice. About his routine, D'Aquisto said, \\"I was making $35 a week. I was like the runner: I'd go to the stores, pick up the tuners, go get the tailpieces from downtown, take the necks to the engraver, all that. I cleaned the windows, swept the floors, everything‚Äîwe all did that. On Friday we put away the tools and cleaned the shop so when Monday came the place would be spotless.\\" Jim Hall (\\"Something Special\\" recording in 1993) Later, he learned the \\"rough work\\" of the D'Angelico style. D'Angelico had a heart attack in 1959 and also parted ways with his long time employee Vincent \\"Jimmy\\" DiSerio. As a result he closed the business but soon reopened it after D'Aquisto who was unable to find work, convinced him to do so. After several more heart attacks and having also suffered from pneumonia John D'Angelico died on September 1, 1964 at the age of 59. Following D'Angelico's death the last ten of his guitars were finished by D'Aquisto. D'Aquisto bought the business but a poor business decision lost him the right to the D‚ÄôAngelico name. D'Aquisto then continued building guitars under his own name. In 1966 he moved to Huntington, Long Island, then to Farmingdale in 1973, and finally Greenport in 1980. He felt he would die at the same age as his mentor, and this did occur on April 17, 1995 when he was 59. D'Aquisto's name is on many guitar models from the Fender \\"D'Aquisto Elite\\" \\"D'Aquisto Ultra\\" and the Hagstr√∂m Jimmy. His blue \\"Centura Deluxe\\" was the inspiration for the book Blue Guitar. His guitars have sold for tens of thousands of dollars to over $500,000. One of his guitars was the first to be worth a million dollars. In 2006, D'Aquisto was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame. His tools and work bench, passed down to him from D'Angelico, were given to the National Music Museum. In 2011, guitars by D'Aquisto were included in the 'Guitar Heroes' exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory but many have been neglected and have deteriorated. An organization, the Sunset Heights Improvement Association helps neighbors on a fixed income to manage home maintenance and also sponsors an annual tour.  History  North Oregon Street and Sunset Heights, 1909. John Fisher Satterthwaite first started purchasing land in the area in the 1880s and by 1885 had built 90 houses. The area was known as the \\"Satterthwaite Addition\\" while he owned the land. Satterthwaite lost the land he'd built in 1894. The name, \\"Sunset Heights,\\" was given to the area in 1901, after the El Paso Herald held a contest for the best name for the neighborhood. Some buildings in Sunset Heights have remnants of tunnels underneath them which may have been started in the early 1900s. Some tunnels, including ones found under El Paso High School, may have been used to smuggle Chinese workers who were banned from the United States because of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. One of the best-known tunnels is underneath the Turtle House in Sunset Heights. During the 1910 Mexican Revolution many affluent Mexicans fled Mexico and settled in Sunset Heights.Corchado, Alfredo. \\"Families, businesses flee Ju√°rez for U.S. pastures.\\" The Dallas Morning News.

During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, Doroteo Arango (as known as Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s. In 1915, a house designed by Trost & Trost in Sunset Heights was used as a meeting place for General Hugh Scott and Pancho Villa. Until around the time of the Great Depression, Sunset Heights was a fashionable neighborhood. The neighborhood was designated as a historic district in 1984, with the help of John Karr. In 2003, the Sunset Heights Neighborhood Association started giving tours of historic areas and homes called the Sunset Heights Tour. Cityscape Sunset Heights is about one mile, and one and half miles across. Because of the historic designation of the neighborhood, residents must adhere to a building code. Blocks in the neighborhood are of different shapes. Houses are designed in various styles including American Foursquare, Tudor Revival, Classical Revival, Queen Anne and Spanish Colonial Revival.

It conducts cultural projects locally, nationally and internationally from its bases at Lawson Park farm and the Coniston Institute. Its focus under director Adam Sutherland (appointed in 1999) is on developing emerging artists and producing experimental yet accessible projects that demonstrate the purpose and function of art as an everyday aspect of a worthwhile and productive life. The organisation is financially supported by Arts Council England. Adam Sutherland guest-curated 'The Land We Live In, The Land We Left Behind' for Hauser & Wirth Somerset in 2018, a major historic and contemporary survey of rural cultures that attracted over 40,000 visitors to the galleries in Bruton. History The predecessor of Grizedale Arts, the Grizedale Society, was founded in 1968 by the Forestry Commission to further the arts within the Grizedale forest. It initially concentrated on theatre and the visual arts. In 1977, it established the Sculpture Project, which was noted for its siting of environmental sculptures by artists including David Nash, Robert Koenig and Andy Goldsworthy within the Grizedale Forest.Popularising public sculpture in Britain From landscape gardens to forest trails University of South Africa These sculptures are now maintained by the Forestry Commission and are accessible to the public.Details of Grizedale Forest Park Forestry Commission website In 1990, the Society was awarded the Prudential Award for the Arts.Grizedale Arts website, history page In 1999, for financial reasons, the board closed its theatre (the \\"Theatre in the Forest\\") and decided to concentrate on exploring new approaches to artistic production and exhibition. In 2007, the organisation moved its base from Grizedale Forest to the historic hill farm of Lawson Park, overlooking Coniston Water. Once owned by John Ruskin and a working farm until the 1950s, architects Sutherland Hussey were employed to transform the farmhouse and barns into an artists' residency base, opened in 2009 by Sir Nicholas Serota of Tate. The surrounding land is being returned to productive use, and the extensive gardens ‚Äì designed by artist / film-maker Karen Guthrie ‚Äì have opened under the National Garden Scheme. Projects Grizedale Arts' projects have included: * A Fair Land (2016) * The Coniston Institute Honest Shop (2013) * Wantee (for the Turner Prize) by Laure Prouvost (2013) * Gralsbaby D'Annunzioz (2009) * Happy Stacking (2008) * Agrifashionista (2008) * Creative Egremont ‚Äì A Public Art Strategy for Egremont.

It opened in August 2001 as the newest high school in the DeKalb County School System, and was named after the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. Development The school was opened to alleviate overcrowding in surrounding middle schools. It originally included only grades 6-7 and 9-10. Tenth grade students came from Lithonia and Southwest DeKalb High Schools to relieve crowding and also due to the rezoning of DeKalb County. The following year, after a protest by the high school students, the school dropped the sixth and seventh graders and added eighth grade. It became a pure high school with grades 9-12 in the 2003-2004 school year. MLK's current principal is Harvey. Feeder school Salem Middle School is the middle school feeder to MLK. International Baccalaureate Diploma MLK implemented the International Baccalaureate Diploma program during the 2004-2005 school year, and it continues to produce top students each year. Awards and recognition The MLK band has received superior ratings in every facet of performance since the school's inception in 2001. Including concert band, jazz band, and marching band. The MLK Wind Ensemble performed in the 2011 Music for All/Bands of America National Concert Band Festival. The MLK marching band known as the \\"Kings of Halftime\\" has traveled to South Africa (2006) and the AT&T; Cotton Bowl (2007). The band attended the Ohio State Buckeye Invitational in 2014. The \\"Kings of Halftime\\" have also performed in the 2017 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, CA and the 2019 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. The MLK Drama team won the Region 2-AAAAA championship in the One-Act Play competition in 2006. The MLK football team has been to the state playoffs every year since it has been a full high school, compiling a remarkable 56-18 record over six years, which is the best record in Georgia football history for a high school in its first six years of existence. The MLK football team were the 2010-2011 Region 2-AAAAA champions, upsetting the Stephenson Jaguars perfect season in a 50-49 victory. This victory led the Lions to the playoffs, where they were defeated in the second round by Colquitt County Packers. They have been Region Champions for three consecutive years. The MLK wrestling team has been acknowledged for their excellence. Laron Taylor placed first at the County tournament at 165 lb. and Wesley Warren placed second at county tournament at 103 lb. The MLK girls' track and field team won the state championships in 2010-2011, beating Westlake. Malcolm McCord and Brandy Ward scored the school's first lacrosse goals for MLK.

Background She was born Vera Florence Annie Bousher, the second daughter of Henry George Bousher a druggist's assistant, and Anne Elizabeth Koster. She married firstly in 1907 Guy Ivo Sebright who died in 1912. In 1918 she married Harold Woodhouse, 2nd Baron Terrington, whom she divorced in 1926. Finally she married Max Lensveld in 1949. Political career She joined the Liberal party and took an active interest in the affairs of South Buckinghamshire. She served as Vice-President of the Buckinghamshire Lace Association. She was a Member of the Grand Council of Our Dumb Friends League.The Woman's Year Book, 1923 At the 1922 general election, she stood as a Liberal candidate in the Wycombe division of Buckinghamshire. Wycombe was a Unionist seat where no Liberal candidate had stood at the previous election and no Liberal had won since 1906. She managed to secure a good second place. She was one of only thirty-three women candidates standing at that election. She contested Wycombe again at the December 1923 general election, and was elected to the House of Commons defeating the sitting Unionist member. Her Unionist opponent was an avowed anti-feminist, and her victory was greeted with special delight among women's societies such as the Six Point Group. This made her one of only eight women in the House of Commons. In Parliament, she supported the abolition of the means test for old-age pensions, making her maiden speech seconding a motion on the subject. She also actively supported the Guardianship of Infants Bill which would have given both parents equal rights to custody. She also campaigned against cruelty to animals. She lost her seat a year later, at the 1924 general election, an election in which Liberal candidates did badly across the country. She did not stand for parliament again. She was active inside the Liberal Party at a national level, particularly with the Women's Liberal Federation moving a resolution promoting women's rights on a broad front and specifically calling for an equal franchise. In 1925 she was re- adopted by Wycombe Liberals as their candidate for the following election but withdrew due to problems in her personal life. After 1949 she moved to South Africa. She did not enter public life in South Africa. She returned to Britain and died on 19 May 1973. She was cremated at Eastbourne on 30 May 1973. Her ashes were interred in East Hoathly Churchyard, East Sussex on 1 August 1973. At the time of her death she was living at Monks Cottage, Graywood, East Hoathly. Her age was given as 84.

It is named after Girard Desargues, and closely related to Desargues' theorem, which proves the existence of the configuration. Constructions Two dimensions Two triangles ABC and abc are said to be in perspective centrally if the lines Aa, Bb, and Cc meet in a common point, called the center of perspectivity. They are in perspective axially if the intersection points of the corresponding triangle sides, , , and all lie on a common line, the axis of perspectivity. Desargues' theorem in geometry states that these two conditions are equivalent: if two triangles are in perspective centrally then they must also be in perspective axially, and vice versa. When this happens, the ten points and ten lines of the two perspectivities (the six triangle vertices, three crossing points, and center of perspectivity, and the six triangle sides, three lines through corresponding pairs of vertices, and axis of perspectivity) together form an instance of the Desargues configuration. Three dimensions Although it may be embedded in two dimensions, the Desargues configuration has a very simple construction in three dimensions: for any configuration of five planes in general position in Euclidean space, the ten points where three planes meet and the ten lines formed by the intersection of two of the planes together form an instance of the configuration . This construction is closely related to the property that every projective plane that can be embedded into a 3-dimensional projective space obeys Desargues' theorem. This three-dimensional realization of the Desargues configuration is also called the complete pentahedron . Four dimensions The 5-cell or pentatope (a regular simplex in four dimensions) has five vertices, ten edges, ten triangular ridges (2-dimensional faces), and five tetrahedral facets; the edges and ridges touch each other in the same pattern as the Desargues configuration. Extend each of the edges of the 5-cell to the line that contains it (its affine hull), similarly extend each triangle of the 5-cell to the 2-dimensional plane that contains it, and intersect these lines and planes by a three-dimensional hyperplane that neither contains nor is parallel to any of them. Each line intersects the hyperplane in a point, and each plane intersects the hyperplane in a line; these ten points and lines form an instance of the Desargues configuration . Symmetries Although Desargues' theorem chooses different roles for its ten lines and points, the Desargues configuration itself is more symmetric: any of the ten points may be chosen to be the center of perspectivity, and that choice determines which six points will be the vertices of triangles and which line will be the axis of perspectivity. The Desargues configuration has a symmetry group S5 of order 120; that is, there are 120 different ways of permuting the points and lines of the configuration in a way that preserves its point-line incidences . The three-dimensional construction of the Desargues configuration makes these symmetries more readily apparent: if the configuration is generated from five planes in general position in three dimensions, then each of the 120 different permutations of these five planes corresponds to a symmetry of the configuration . The Desargues configuration is self-dual, meaning that it is possible to find a correspondence from points of one Desargues configuration to lines of a second configuration, and from lines of the first configuration to points of a second configuration, in such a way that all of the configuration's incidences are preserved . Graphs The Levi graph of the Desargues configuration, a graph having one vertex for each point or line in the configuration, is known as the Desargues graph. Because of the symmetries and self-duality of the Desargues configuration, the Desargues graph is a symmetric graph. The Petersen graph, in the layout shown by draws a different graph for this configuration, with ten vertices representing its ten lines, and with two vertices connected by an edge whenever the corresponding two lines do not meet at one of the points of the configuration. Alternatively, the vertices of this graph may be interpreted as representing the points of the Desargues configuration, in which case the edges connect pairs of points for which the line connecting them is not part of the configuration. This publication marks the first known appearance of the Petersen graph in the mathematical literature, 12 years before Julius Petersen's use of the same graph as a counterexample to an edge coloring problem. Related configurations A non-Desargues (103103) configuration. As a projective configuration, the Desargues configuration has the notation (103103), meaning that each of its ten points is incident to three lines and each of its ten lines is incident to three points. Its ten points can be viewed in a unique way as a pair of mutually inscribed pentagons, or as a self-inscribed decagon . The Desargues graph, a 20-vertex bipartite symmetric cubic graph, is so called because it can be interpreted as the Levi graph of the Desargues configuration, with a vertex for each point and line of the configuration and an edge for every incident point-line pair. There also exist eight other (103103) configurations (that is, sets of points and lines in the Euclidean plane with three lines per point and three points per line) that are not incidence-isomorphic to the Desargues configuration, one of which is shown at right. In all of these configurations, each point has three other points that are not collinear with it. But in the Desargues configuration, these three points are always collinear with each other (if the chosen point is the center of perspectivity, then the three points form the axis of perspectivity) while in the other configuration shown in the illustration these three points form a triangle of three lines. As with the Desargues configuration, the other depicted configuration can be viewed as a pair of mutually inscribed pentagons. The Desargues configuration viewed as a pair of mutually inscribed pentagons: each pentagon vertex lies on the line through one of the sides of the other pentagon.

It is held the day after Passover, marking the return to eating hametz (leavened bread, etc.), which is forbidden throughout the week of Passover. Mofletta and other holiday confections History Though the practice only began to be recorded in the middle of the 18th century, its derivation and etymology are ancient. Possible derivations for the name Mimouna are: \\"Rabbi Maimon ben Yosef\\" (father of the Rambam Maimonides). Thus, the Mimouna might mark the date of his birth or death; the Hebrew word \\"emuna\\" (, meaning \\"faith\\") or \\"ma‚Äôamin\\" (, meaning \\"I believe\\"); the Arabic word for \\"wealth\\" or \\"good luck\\" as on this day, according to midrash, the gold and jewelry of the drowned Egyptians washed up on the shore of the Reed Sea and enriched the Israelites. Mimouna is associated with \\"faith\\" and \\"belief\\" in immediate prosperity, as seen in its customs of matchmaking, and well-wishes for successful childbearing; manna, which was the food God provided following the Exodus, and during the subsequent wandering in the desert. Mimouna celebrates belief in both the past Jewish redemption from the Egyptians and the future Messianic redemption: \\"In Nisan (the month in which Passover falls), the Jews were redeemed and in Nisan they will be redeemed in the future. When Passover ends and the Jews are still not redeemed, the Moroccan Jews do not lose their faith; as the Sages said: 'Even if he tarries, I will expect him every day.'\\" It was at the crossing of the Red Sea on the final day of Passover that the entire nation witnessed the awesome power and might of God which was an experience that strengthened their faith. \\"And Israel saw the great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared the LORD; and they believed in the LORD, and in His servant Moses.\\" - Holiday customs United States Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro at a Mimouna celebration in Ashkelon, 2013 In Morocco, on the afternoon of the last day of Passover, Jewish families prepare flour, honey, milk, and butter to be used to prepare post-Passover chametz celebration dinners.Eating Jewish: Mufleta Historically, Jewish congregations would walk to an orchard in order to recite Birkat Ha'Ilanot, and following the conclusion of Passover, would recite passages from the Book of Proverbs and the Mishna. The celebration begins after nightfall on the last day of Passover. In many communities, non- Jewish neighbors sell chametz back to Jewish families as a beginning of the celebration. Moroccan and Algerian Jews throw open their homes to visitors, after setting out a lavish spread of traditional holiday cakes and sweetmeats. One of the holiday favorites is Mofletta. The table is also laid with various symbols of luck and fertility, with an emphasis on the number \\"5,\\" such as five pieces of gold jewelry or five beans arranged on a leaf of pastry. The repetition of the number five references the five-fingered hamsa amulet common in both Jewish and Muslim North African and Middle Eastern communities from pre-modern times. Typically all those in attendance at a Mimouna celebration are sprinkled with a mint sprig or other green dipped in milk, symbolizing good fortune and new beginnings. Early in the day of the Mimouna, families go to the sea, splash water on their face, and walk barefoot in the water, to replay the scene of the miraculous crossing of the Reed Sea, which is held to have taken place on the last day of Passover. In Israel, the Mimouna has become a popular annual happening featuring outdoor parties, picnics, BBQs, and politics: A central celebration in Jerusalem‚Äôs Sacher Park draws about 100,000 people, usually including the president and prime minister. Israeli law now requires employers to agree to grant an employee unpaid leave for Mimouna if asked. One source estimated that in 2012 nearly two million people in Israel participated in Mimouna festivities.

The main options under consideration are an offshore oil pipeline from Kazakhstan to Azerbaijan, and construction of oil terminals and oil tankers fleet. A strong push for the project has been from the partners of the Kashagan oilfield project and in particular Total who has a share in both the field and the BTC pipeline. They have estimated that such a project would cost roughly US$4 billion. The project also faces opposition from Iran and Russia, both alternative avenues for Kazakhstan's oil and gas who would likely object to competing pipelines being built. History In 2005, the Government of Kazakhstan adopted plans for creation of a trans-Caspian westbound route for oil export. On 19 June 2006, President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed a framework agreement on the trans-Caspian oil transport system. On 24 January 2007, partners in TengizChevroil (developer of Tengiz field) and KCO (Kashagan field developer)signed a memorandum of understanding to create a trans-Caspian oil transport system. On 2 October 2009, the national oil company of Kazakhstan Kazmunaygas and the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic signed a memorandum of understanding to expand the Caspian Oil Transport System to include Azeri infrastructure and onshore pipelines from Baku to Kulevi oil terminal in Georgia. On 6 October 2009, an agreement on the oil pipeline from Kashagan to Baku was signed by consortium of French companies during the French President Nicolas Sarkozy's visit to Kazakhstan. Oil pipeline A long oil pipeline will run from Kashagan field or Kuryk to Baku. Work for the pipeline is still in the feasibility stage according to an official from the oil company Total.

Background  There had been fears of an impending terrorist attack in Yemen since February 2006, when 23 Al Qaeda prisoners escaped from a Yemeni prison. The September 15th attacks came just before the country's Presidential elections. Only days before the attacks, Al Qaeda's second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, issued a videotaped threat of attacks on the Persian Gulf and on facilities he blamed for stealing Muslim oil; analysts point to Al Qaeda as the likely perpetrator of the attacks.\\"Suicide bombers foiled in Yemen attack\\" (Link dead as of 15 January 2007)  Dubba Port attack  At 5:15 am local time, two attempted suicide bombers drove toward the Dubba Port, reportedly \\"at great speed\\", in an attempt to blow up storage tanks containing large amounts of oil. According to a statement by Yemen's Interior Ministry, the driver of the car was wearing a uniform similar to those worn by staff at the facility, and the second driver was dressed in a military uniform. The guards at the port managed to detonate the vehicles before it reached its target. In the resulting blast, one security guard was killed.

For other people, see Langtry (surname). Roberta Langtry (1916 ‚Äì August 13, 2005), an anonymous philanthropist, was a modestly paid Toronto elementary school teacher and a multimillionaire. Upon her death she bequeathed more than C$4.3-million (equivalent to ¬£2 million / US$3.8 million at then-current exchange rates) of her estate to the Nature Conservancy of Canada, a charity that buys environmentally sensitive land and turns it into nature reserves. She had been a modest supporter of NCC's work since 1999. While she was alive, she made a number of large, anonymous gifts to individuals she knew who were in need. Recipients would receive envelopes from an unknown benefactor in the amounts of $25,000 or $30,000. Her friends and coworkers were unaware of her wealth. Langtry was born in Manitoba. She began teaching around the age of 16. Most of her 55 years as a teacher and speech therapist were with the East York Board of Education. She never married and had no children. Langtry lived in her aunt's modest bungalow, sharing it with her aunt until she died in the early 1990s and living alone until she died herself.  Sources of Wealth  Langtry may have earned a modest side income via her development of a number of puzzle-based educational games, that were sold in the United States. In 1960, she co-authored Teacher's guide to accompany Creative English, grade four with J.D. Hanmer (Vancouver : Copp Clark Pub. Co.). Speculation suggests the majority of her wealth came from many wise investments. Most of her money was in bonds and solid Canadian blue-chip stocks, such as those of the banks and insurance companies, that appreciated over the decades. Most likely her best investment was in shares of IBM, which she purchased in either the 1940s or 1950s. She held these shares until she died.

It features compatibility with most older Nikkor F-mount lenses, except AFS and pre-AI lenses. However, in some cases autofocus and/or TTL metering is not supported. Features of the F60 include the 'T' Time setting - where a first press of the shutter release opens the shutter, and a second closes it, and AF servo tracking in 'Sport' mode. The camera also supports five different flash modes, including 'slow' for low light scenes. The film speed is only automatically adjustable by DX encoding. Notable omissions include depth-of-field preview and any form of remote shutter release. Both these features were included in the F65.

John de Havilland‚Äôs interest in heraldry and armorial bearings is shown in 1865 when he updated Thomas Fiott de Havilland‚Äôs 1852 book ‚ÄúA Chronicle of the Ancient and Noble Norman Family of de Havilland‚Äù. John de Havilland‚Äôs updated edition gives considerable detail to the lives of his own parents and grandparents with their heraldic coats of arms displayed in the margins. John de Havilland explains that his maternal grandfather, William Ludwig von Sonntag, was born in Pforzheim (modern South West Germany) in 1745. Captain William Ludwig von Sonntag was one of the 10,000 troops of King Louis XVI of France that were sent under the Count de Rochambeau to America to aid the Americans in their Revolutionary War against Great Britain. Captain von Sonntag was present with his regiment at the siege of York-Town, in Virginia, where Lord Cornwallis surrendered, which virtually closed the war; the independence of the States being acknowledged soon after by Great Britain. John de Havilland also gives a swashbuckling account of his paternal grandfather, James Haviland, as being remembered in Somersetshire for his wonderful strength and cool courage. An example of this cool courage is given whereby James Haviland is captured by the French during a yachting excursion and held as a prisoner at Brest. During James Haviland‚Äôs imprisonment he defeats a French officer who is the best swordsman in the garrison. The unarmed James‚Äô death seemed very likely ‚Äì after an argument over a card game and after he had floored the Frenchman - as the Frenchman returned with his sword. James parried the sword of the lunging Frenchman and replied with a red hot poker - taken from the bars of a fire grate - into the Frenchman‚Äôs mouth passing through his cheek thus ending the contest. In 1872, John de Havilland was made a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He is also remembered as a soldier of fortune who served in Spain under Don Carlos where he became a General in the Spanish Army. According to a College of Arms Monograph, he was of uncommon physical strength and one of the most picturesque characters in the history of the College of Arms. In 1880, John de Havilland used the rank of General in his correspondences. At this time, John de Havilland took an active part in politics and was a member of the Liberal Reform Club. Correspondence between the Political Committee of the Reform Club and General John de Havilland from April 1880 until June that year indicate that he could be a colourful and controversial character. The General 'conspicuously canvassed' against the Liberal candidate - Mr. C. Acland - for the Western Division of Somerset. In statements by a Mr. C. Lamport sent to the Liberal Reform Club in Pall Mall London, General John de Havilland was said to have \\"voted for the Conservative candidates for the election for this division for the county. He drove into Wellington in a carriage displaying the Tory colours, and himself wore such evidence of partisanship. I met him at the door of the polling booth, and on expostulating with him as being a member of the Club, he justified his vote by stating that 'half the members of the Club, if polled, would vote for the Conservatives.'\\" It was resolved that General John de Havilland be expelled from the Club. The copy of the resolution also states that: \\"There can be no doubt that the action of the Committee was prompted by the Radical members of the Reform Club, who for a long time have made war upon those who still maintain the politics of its founders. These Radicals, worshippers of Mr. Gladstone, expelled Mr. Charles Liddell at the same time with General de Havilland. They never miss an opportunity of showing their political liberty towards a \\"Reformer\\" showing any independence of character. And General de Havilland having in January 1877 dedicated to Lord Beaconsfield a pamphlet entitled \\"England herself at Constantinople, the best solution of the Eastern Question,\\" (since then we have acquired Cyprus and Egypt!) these Radicals of the Reform seized upon the fact of General de Havilland's having openly expressed his dissent from the foreign policy Mr. Gladstone advocated before the last general election, and his opposition to Home Rule, as a pretext for his expulsion from the Reform Club.\\" John von Sonntag de Havilland died on 18 September 1886 and was buried at Langford Budville, in Somerset, England. Heraldic career John de Havilland began his career as an officer of arms in 1866 when he was appointed Rouge Croix Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary. On 26 March 1872, he was promoted to the position of York Herald of Arms in Ordinary. It is also notable that de Havilland helped in the publication of the 1878 edition of Burke's General Armory, which remains a standard reference work for those interested in heraldry. Coat of arms John de Havilland used a coat of arms recorded at the 1623 visitation of Gloucester. The arms are blazoned \\"Argent three Towers triple-towered Sable Portcullises Gules\\". As York Herald, de Havilland impaled these with his maternal arms of von Sonntag, blazoned \\"Azure a Sun in splendor proper\\" in the window of St Peter's Church, illustrated below, and used a Chief of Religion as a Knight of Malta in addition to setting his shield on the Maltese Cross. See image (4) below by Bedford Lemere & Co - a firm of British architectural photographers active in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.... The von Sonntag arms are otherwise recorded as \\"argent a sun in splendour proper\\" in a 1963 monograph, although this may be an error, as it breaches the heraldic rule of tincture. John de Havilland's coat of arms can also be seen at St Peter's Church at Langford Budville (near Wellington) in the County of Somerset, England. They are set in a stained glass window there. His father - John Haviland - has his coat of arms on the left. His mother - Mary von Sonntag - has her coat of arms are on the right. It can be seen in the photograph below that John de Havilland's coat of arms is a combination of the parental coats of arms...... (5) St Peter's Church at Langford Budville, Somerset, England.

Brown had represented the Scottish League earlier that month.http://www.londonhearts.com/SFL/players/sandybrown.html The athletic hard man played in several positions. Harry Catterick saw his ability to read the game and played him in front of the back four when it was needed. Against West Ham he was deployed to intercept through balls toward Hurst and Peters. He was most effective as an overlapping full-back but also played as an emergency attacker and scored against Real Zaragoza in a European game during the 1966‚Äì67 season. In fact he played in every position during his Everton career, including goalkeeper. This came after Gordon West was sent off in a game against Newcastle United. He played four games on Everton's way to the 1966 FA Cup Final but didn't play at Wembley and missed out on a winner's medal. He did achieve silverware though, picking up a League Champions medal for the 1969-70 season with Everton. Arguably his most memorable moment was an own goal scored during the Merseyside Derby in that championship-winning season. Many pundits including Saint and Greavsie celebrated the goal in later years, with Danny Baker referring to it is \\"the own goal by which all other own goals are surely measured\\" in his video 'Own Goals and Gaffs'.http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3132923819903042916# In total he played 251 games in all competitions for Everton, scoring 11 goals.Since 1888.

It is located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville. History Knoxville Catholic High School, originally located on East Magnolia Avenue, registered 98 young men and women in 1932. The faculty was composed of four Sisters of Mercy and two lay teachers. The Reverend Christopher P. Murray was appointed director of Knoxville Catholic High School in 1941. Under the direction of Father Murray, additional space was added including a gymnasium-auditorium, dressing rooms, showers, and a science laboratory. In 1947, Knoxville Catholic High School, often referred to by the acronym KCHS, became an accredited member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. March 1951 saw the breaking of ground for another addition. The new building included five classrooms, a library, offices, lavatories, and an addition to the gymnasium. Space was made for a cafeteria and a chapel. The extensive campus provided fields for softball, basketball, and other sports. Father Herbert Prescott became the first priest- principal of Knoxville Catholic High School in 1962. Father John Batson was named principal in 1965 and Father Xavier Mankel in 1967. Father Mankel had a long and distinguished career helping to monitor and guide the growth and development of KCHS until 1979. Father Michael Johnston was appointed as the fourth priest-principal to serve KCHS in 1979. Father Frank Richards followed in 1982. At this time the School Board of KCHS began to organize a major capital Fund Raising Campaign to ensure the future of the private, Catholic school located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Father G. Patrick Garrity arrived as principal in 1985. The school continued to grow in facilities and students. Enrollment continued to increase over the next several years and with it a growth of faculty. The decision to move KCHS to a new facility was announced in February 1997. After almost seven decades on Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville Catholic High School would be moving to the Cedar Bluff area in West Knoxville. In July 1997, Mr. Philip Dampf became the principal of KCHS and he oversaw the school‚Äôs move to West Knoxville. By January 2000, the construction of the new facilities was complete. Knoxville Catholic High School relocated to 9245 Fox Lonas Road and was dedicated by Bishop Joseph E. Kurtz on January 3, 2000. In 2001, Mr. Dampf resigned and Dr. Aurelia Montgomery was appointed as Interim Principal. After the successful completion of a $1 million campaign, KCHS was proud to announce the building of an All Sports Complex. Construction of the All Sports Complex was finished in 2002 in order to accommodate the growing athletic programs for KCHS. In 2004, Dr. Montgomery retired as Interim Principal and the search committee found a successful candidate in Dickie Sompayrac, who began his tenure as KCHS principal in 2005. Also in 2005 a new Performing Arts Center was built and dedicated, providing much needed space for the performing arts. As enrollment continues to increase, plans are underway to build additional facilities. In November 2006, Catholic High launched a three-phased Living our Mission through Growth Capital Campaign. On January 6, 2008, KCHS celebrated the completion of a new wing with a blessing ceremony performed Reverend Al Humbrecht. The expansion was the first phase of the school's capital campaign and added ten classrooms, a guidance suite, and additional parking to the campus. Reverend Chris Michelson, Pastor of St. Albert the Great and Capital Campaign Chair, announced the wing would be dedicated as Schaad Hall. With a donation to the school‚Äôs endowment from the late Isabel Ashe Bonnyman ‚Äò39, Knoxville Catholic High School was able to complete the second phase of the campaign and provide the school with a solid financial foundation. Faris Field House was named for John and Sondra Faris and completed the school's capital effort. It added 8,000 square feet of weight training facilities, athletic offices, locker rooms, and storage for the Catholic school's growing boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô fitness programs. Academics KCHS is a member of the National Catholic Education Association and accredited by: * Tennessee Department of Education * Southern Association of Colleges and Schools * Roman Catholic Diocese of Knoxville Each student takes eight classes a semester and attends seven each day. KCHS uses a rotating block schedule system for an optimum learning environment. Sports Knoxville Catholic is the home of the Fighting Irish. The school colors are green and gold.

He was a member of the Wuffingas dynasty, which ruled East Anglia from their regio (centre of royal authority) at Rendlesham. The two Anglo- Saxon cemeteries at Sutton Hoo, the monastery at Iken, the East Anglian see at Dommoc and the emerging port of Ipswich were all in the vicinity of Rendlesham. √Üthelwold lived during a time of political and religious upheaval in East Anglia, whose Christian kings in the decades prior to his succession all died violent deaths, having proved unequal to the task of defending the newly converted kingdom against attacks from its neighbouring kingdom, Mercia, led by its pagan king, Penda. √Üthelwold was the last of the nephews of R√¶dwald to rule East Anglia. He died in 664 and was succeeded by Ealdwulf, the son of his brother √Üthelric. Few records relating to East Anglia have survived and almost nothing is known of √Üthelwold's life or reign. He succeeded his elder brother √Üthelhere, after √Üthelhere was killed with Penda of Mercia at the Battle of the Winw√¶d in about 655. During his rule he witnessed a setback in the aspirations of Mercia to dominate its neighbours, following the Battle of the Winw√¶d and the murder of Penda's son, Peada. He was king during the last decade of the co-existence in England of the Christian Roman rite, centred at Canterbury, and the Celtic rite based in Northumbria. At the Synod of Whitby, in 664, the Roman cause prevailed and the division of ecclesiastical authorities ceased. In 662, Swithelm of Essex was persuaded to adopt Christianity and was baptised at Rendlesham, with √Üthelwold present as his sponsor. East Anglia became more closely allied to Northumbria, Kent and lands in the Fens by means of royal marriages such as that between the Northumbrian Hereswitha and the East Anglian √Üthilric. Historical context The emergence of the Kingdom of the East Angles Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, including places relevant to √Üthelwold's reign The history of East Anglia and its kings is known from The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, compiled by the Northumbrian monk Bede in 731, and a genealogical list from the Anglian collection, dating from the 790s, in which the ancestry of √Ülfwald of East Anglia was traced back through fourteen generations to W≈çden.Warner, The Origins of Suffolk, p. 70. East Anglia was a long-lived Anglo-Saxon kingdom in which a duality of a northern and a southern part existed, corresponding with the modern English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk.Lapidge, Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p. 154. It was formed during the 5th century, following the ending of Roman power in Britain in 410.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 25‚Äì26. The east of Britain became settled at an early date by Saxons and Angles from the continent. During the 5th century, groups of settlers of mixed stock migrated into the Fens and up the major rivers inland.Warner, The Origins of Suffolk, pp. 60‚Äì61. From Bede it is known that the people who settled in what became East Anglia were Angles, originally from what is now part of Denmark. By the 6th century, new settlements had also appeared along the river systems of the east coast of East Anglia, including the Deben, the Alde and the Orwell.Warner, The Origins of Suffolk, p. 64. The settlers were unaffected by Roman urban civilisation and had their own religion and language. As more of the region fell under their control, new kingdoms were formed, replacing the function of the Roman territoria.Warner, The Origins of Suffolk, pp. 66‚Äì67. Surrounded by sea, fenland, large defensive earthworks such as the Devil's Dyke and wide rivers, all of which acted to disconnect it from the rest of Britain, the land of the East Angles eventually became united by a single ruling dynasty, the Wuffingas. R√¶dwald and his successors The first king of the East Angles of whom more than a name is known was R√¶dwald, described by Bede as 'the son of Tytil, whose father was Wuffa',Kirby, The Earliest English Kings, p. 52. who reigned from about 599 until approximately 624. According to Bede, he was converted to Christianity at the court of his overlord √Üthelberht of Kent in about 604. Later in his reign he was powerful enough to hold imperium over several Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In 616, he defeated √Üthelfrith of Northumbria and installed the exiled Edwin as the new king.Lapidge, The Blackwall Encyclopaedia of Anglo- Saxon England, p. 385. He is thought to have been given a ship burial and interred amongst a magnificent array of personal treasures and symbols of regal power that were discovered under Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo, in Suffolk.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 82. His son Eorpwald succeeded him and reigned briefly before he was killed soon after his baptism, by a heathen named Ricberht, after which the East Angles reverted to paganism.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 62. Ricberht was replaced by Sigeberht, whose Christian education ensured that Christianity was reestablished. During Sigeberht's joint reign with Ecgric, the East Anglian see at Dommoc was established.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, pp. 100‚Äì101. During 632 or 633, Edwin of Northumbria was overthrown and slain and his kingdom was ravaged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan, supported by Penda of Mercia.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 80‚Äì81 The Mercians then turned on the East Angles and their king, Ecgric. In 640 or 641, they routed the East Anglian army in a battle in which Ecgric and his predecessor Sigeberht both perished.Warner, The Origins of Suffolk, pp. 110‚Äì13. See Kirby, The Early English Kings, p. 207 for a discussion of the problematic dating of the battle in which Ecgric was killed. Ecgric's successor, √Üthelwold's brother Anna, who was renowned for his devout Christianity and the saintliness of his children, proved ineffective in preventing East Anglia from being invaded by the Mercians. Following a Mercian attack in 651 on the monastery at Cnobheresburg, Anna was exiled by Penda, possibly to the kingdom of the Magons√¶te. After his return, East Anglia was attacked again by Penda, Anna's forces were defeated and he was killed. During the reign of his successor, √Üthelhere (another brother of √Üthelwold), East Anglia was eclipsed by Mercia. In 655, after the Battle of the Winw√¶d, near Leeds, in which √Üthelhere was slain fighting beside Penda,Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 63. a new political situation arose. Penda's son Peada, who had ruled the Mercian province of the Middle Angles as a Christian king from 653, now succeeded Penda as king of Mercia, but he was murdered a year later.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 84. Peada's death dealt a severe blow to Mercian aspirations of dominion over the other kingdoms of England.  The sphere of Rendlesham  The royal seat of Rendlesham, specified by Bede,Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, pp. 65‚Äì66. seals the evident importance of the Deben estuary headwaters as a centre of royal power, demonstrated for an earlier period by the royal cemetery of Sutton Hoo.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo- Saxon Times, pp. 75‚Äì76. Rendlesham, a short distance from Iken, the site of Botolph's monastery, stands at a strategic point between the rivers Deben and Alde at the headwaters of the Butley estuary, which intersects the peninsula between the two major rivers. The dedication of Rendlesham's church to St Gregory suggests its early, perhaps primary connection with the royal dwelling mentioned by Bede. If the Dommoc bishopric was at Walton, as Rochester claimed in the thirteenth century, then this was also immediately within the sphere of Rendlesham. Archaeologists have revealed that the quay of Gipeswic (now modern Ipswich), at a ford of the River Orwell estuary, was then growing in importance as a centre of seaborne trade to the continent, under direct royal patronage.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 69. Descent, family and accession √Üthelwold (Old English 'noble ruler')Bosworth, A dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon language, pp. 12, 438. was a member of the Wuffingas dynasty, the youngest son of Eni and a nephew of R√¶dwald of East Anglia. Two of his brothers, Anna and √Üthelhere, ruled in succession before him.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 68. His accession is mentioned by the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, in Gesta Regum Anglorum: :\\"To Anna succeeded his brother Ethelhere, who was justly slain by Oswy king of the Northumbrians, together with Penda, because he was an auxiliary to him, and was actually supporting his brother and his kinsman. His brother Ethelwald, in due succession, left the kingdom to Adulf and Elwold, the sons of Ethelhere.\\"William of Malmesbury, Gesta regum Anglorum Book 1, chp. 5, p. 89.\\"Successit Ann√¶ frater ejus Ethelhere, occisusque est a rege Northanhimbrorum Oswio cum Penda merito, quod ei concurreret in auxilium, et fulciret exercitum qui pessum dedisset fratrem et cognatum. Hujus successor frater Ethelwaldus continuatis successionibus regnum reliquit ejusdem Ethelherii filiis Aldnlfo.\\" (William of Malmesbury, Book 1, ¬ß97) Dynastic alliances bound √Üthelwold's kingdom strongly to the Christian kingdom of Kent, where Seaxburh, the eldest daughter of √Üthelwold's elder brother Anna, was Eorcenberht of Kent's queen.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 37. East Anglia's western stronghold in the Fens was held by Seaxburh's sister √Üthelthryth and, like Kent, it was devoutly attached to the Roman Church. There was also an important Northumbrian connection: in 657, Hilda established the monastery of Streoneshalh (identified with Whitby), which later became the burial-place of Edwin and other Northumbrian kings. Hilda's sister Hereswitha married √Üthelwold's youngest brother √Üthelric in around 627‚Äì629.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 66.  Reign   Christianity in East Anglia under √Üthelwold  The kingdom of East Anglia during the early Saxon period The influence of the Celtic rite in East Anglia had been strong whilst the monastery of Saint Fursey and Saint Foillan at Cnobheresburg had existed. The authority of East Anglian Christianity still resided in the East Anglian see at Dommoc, obedient to Canterbury. Saint Botolph began to build his monastery at Iken, on a tidal island site in the River Alde, in about 653, the year that Anna was killed at the Battle of Bulcamp.Plunkett, Suffolk in Anglo-Saxon Times, p. 116. Oswiu successfully persuaded Sigeberht II of the East Saxons to receive baptismStenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 121. and Cedd, a Northumbrian disciple of Aidan's, was diverted from the Northumbrian mission to the Middle Angles under Peada to become Bishop of the East Saxons and re-convert the people. Cedd built monasteries at Tilbury in the south and at Ythanc√¶ster, where there was an old Roman fort, at what is now Bradwell-on-Sea, in north- east Essex.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 48. Sigebert was assassinated by his own thegns and was succeeded by the pagan Swithelm of Essex. Cedd persuaded him to accept the faith and, according to Bede, his baptism by Cedd took place at Rendlesham, in the presence of King √Üthelwold: > \\"Sigebert was succeeded in the kingdom by Suidhelm, the son of Sexbald, who > was baptized by the same Cedd, in the province of the East Angles, at the > king's countryseat, called Rendelsham, that is, Rendil's Mansion; and > Ethelwald, king of the East Angles, brother to Anna, king of the same > people, was his godfather.\\"Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English > People, iii, p. 22.\\"Successit autem Sigbercto inregnum Suidhelm, filius > Sexbaldi, qui baptizatus est ab ipso Cedde in prouincia Orientalium > Anglorum, in uico regio, qui dicitur Rendlasham, id est mansio Rendili; > suscepitque eum ascendentem de fonto sancto Aediluald rex ipsius gentis > Orientalium Anglorum, frater Anna regis eorundem.\\" (Bede, iii, 22)  East Anglian marriage alliances  In the early 660s, two important marriages took place. Ecgfrith of Northumbria, the fifteen-year-old son of Oswiu, married √Üthelthryth of Ely, the daughter of Anna of East Anglia (who was about fourteen years older than him), and moved to live with him at his Northumbrian court. She had remained a virgin for Christ during her first marriage; she continued in this resolve as Ecgfrityh's bride, with the result that he could not expect to father an heir. √Üthelthryth retained Ely as her own possession during this marriage.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, pp. 66, 81, 111. Meanwhile, Wulfhere of Mercia, a brother of Peada, emerged from safe retreat and was proclaimed king. He was not Christian, but was soon converted and subsequently married Eormenhilda, daughter of Eorcenberht of Kent and Seaxburh. Soon afterwards he founded the monastery of Medeshamstede, which later became known as Peterborough, under abbot Seaxwulf.  Synod of Whitby  Following the death of Finan, bishop of Lindisfarne, Alhfrith of Deira, in collusion with Wilfred of York, Agilbert of Wessex and others, were determined to persuade Oswiu to rule in favour of the Roman rite of Christianity within the kingdoms over which he had imperium. The case was debated in Oswiu's presence at the Synod of Whitby in 664, with Colm√°n, Hild and Cedd defending the Celtic rite and the tradition inherited from Aidan, and Wilifred speaking for the Roman position.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 123. The Roman cause prevailed and the former division of ecclesiastical authorities was set aside. Those who could not accept it, including Colm√°n, departed elsewhere.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p. 80. At that time plague swept through Europe and Anglo- Saxon England. Amongst its victims was Bishop Cedd, Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury, and Eorconbehrt of Kent. √Üthelwold also died in 664.

It took place in the vicinity of and inside the Swabian (then Bavarian) city of Ulm. The French Grande Arm√©e, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, comprised 210,000 troops organized into seven corps, and hoped to knock out the Austrian army in the Danube before Russian reinforcements could arrive. Through rapid marching, Napoleon conducted a large wheeling maneuver that captured an Austrian army of 23,000 under General Mack on 20 October at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The campaign is generally regarded as a strategic masterpiece and was influential in the development of the Schlieffen Plan in the late 19th century.Richard Brooks (editor), Atlas of World Military History. p. 156. It is a historical clich√© to compare the Schlieffen Plan with Hannibal's tactical envelopment at Cannae (216 BC); Schlieffen owed more to Napoleon's strategic maneuver on Ulm (1805). The victory at Ulm did not end the war, since a large Russian army under Kutuzov was still near Vienna. The Russians withdrew to the northeast to await reinforcements and to link up with surviving Austrian units. The French followed and captured Vienna on 12 November. On 2 December the decisive French victory at Austerlitz removed Austria from the war. The resulting Treaty of Pressburg in late December brought the Third Coalition to an end and left Napoleonic France as the major power in Central Europe, leading to the War of the Fourth Coalition with Prussia and Russia the following year. Prelude Europe had been by then embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798 but this too was defeated by 1801. Britain remained the only opponent for the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace. There were many problems between the two sides and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all colonial conquests since 1793 and France was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta.David Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 304 The tense situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush the Haitian Revolution.Chandler p. 320 In May 1803, Britain declared war on France. Third Coalition In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity to form a new coalition against France. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance.Chandler p. 328. The Baltic was dominated by Russia, something Britain wasn't comfortable with since it provided valuable commodities like timber, tar and hemp, crucial supplies to Britain's empire. Britain supported the Ottoman Empire against Russian incursions towards the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, French territorial rearrangements in Germany occurred without Russian consultation and Napoleon's annexations in the Po valley increasingly strained relations between the two. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge,France had defeated Austrian in the War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1797) and the War of the Second Coalition (1798‚Äì1801) Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.Chandler p. 331 French military preparations Prior to the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled the \\"Army of England,\\" an invasion force meant to strike at the British Isles, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. Although they never set foot on British soil, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Although boredom quickly set in among the troops, Napoleon paid many visits to conduct lavish parades to maintain their morale.Chandler p. 323 The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call \\"La Grande Arm√©e\\" (The Great Army). At the start, the French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units, each containing about 36 to 40 cannon each and capable of independent action until other corps could arrive.Chandler p. 332 On top, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 troopers organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions and two divisions of dismounted dragoons and light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, La Grande Arm√©e had grown to a force of 350,000,Chandler p. 333 was equipped and trained. It possessed a competent officer class where almost all from sergeants to marshals had experience in the recent Revolutionary Wars. Austrian military preparations Archduke Charles, brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), the military-political council responsible for decision making in the Austrian armed forces.Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire. p. 31 Charles was Austria's best field commander,Andrew Uffindell, Great Generals of the Napoleonic Wars. p. 155 but he was unpopular with the royal court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the infantry on the eve of war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies rather than the older three battalions of six companies. The sudden change came with no corresponding officer training; new units were led by commanders who had not been given sufficient tactical training in using their units.Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire. p. 32 Austrian cavalry forces were regarded as the best in Europe, but the detachment of many cavalry units to various infantry formations precluded the hitting power of their massed French counterparts, who could, at the orders of Napoleon, amass a whole corps of cavalry to influence the battle. Campaign European strategic situation in 1805 before the start of the Ulm campaign The Ulm campaign lasted for nearly a month and saw the French army under Napoleon deliver blow after blow to the confused Austrians. It culminated on 20 October with the loss of an entire Austrian army. Austrian plans and preparations General Mack thought that Austrian security relied on sealing off the gaps through the mountainous Black Forest area in Southern Germany that had witnessed much fighting during the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars. Mack believed that there would be no action in central Germany. Mack decided to make the city of Ulm the centerpiece of his defensive strategy, which called for a containment of the French until the Russians under Kutuzov could arrive and alter the odds against Napoleon. Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack the impression that the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 36 Fatally, the Aulic Council decided to make Northern Italy the main theater of operations for the Habsburgs. Archduke Charles was assigned 95,000 troops and directed to cross the Adige River with Mantua, Peschiera, and Milan as the initial objectives.David Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 382 The Austrians based an army of 72,000 men on Ulm. Nominally commanded by Archduke Ferdinand, the army's real authority was Mack. Austrian strategy required that Archduke John with 23,000 troops secure the Tyrol and provide the link between his brother Charles's army and his cousin Ferdinand's army. The Austrians also detached individual corps to serve with the Swedish in Pomerania and the British in Naples, though these were designed to confuse the French and divert their resources. French plans and preparations The French concentrated around the Rhine from early to mid- September. 210,000 troops of the Grande Arm√©e prepared to cross into Germany and encircle the Austrians. In both the campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater as the central focus of French efforts, but in both instances the Italian theater became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be launched eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest. Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal Mass√©na would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the Arm√©e d'Italie, St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.Chandler p. 385 Murat and Bertrand conducted reconnaissance between the area bordering the Tyrol and the Main as Savary, chief of the planning staff, drew up detailed road surveys of the areas between the Rhine and the Danube. The left wing of the Grande Arm√©e would move from Hanover in northern Germany and Utrecht in the Netherland to fall on W√ºrttemberg; the right and center, troops from the Channel coast, would concentrate along the Middle Rhine around cities like Mannheim and Strasbourg. While Murat was making demonstrations across the Black Forest, other French forces would then invade the German heartland and swing towards the southeast by capturing Augsburg, a move that was supposed to isolate Mack and interrupt the Austrian lines of communication. The French invasion The French invasion in late September and early October caught the Austrians unprepared and severed their lines of communication. On 22 September Mack decided to hold the Iller line anchored on Ulm. In the last three days of September, the French began the furious marches that would place them at the Austrian rear. Mack believed that the French would not violate Prussian territory, but when he heard that Bernadotte's I Corps had marched through Prussian Ansbach, he made the critical decision to stay and defend Ulm rather than retreat to the south, which would have offered a reasonable opportunity at saving the bulk of his forces.Frederick Kagan, The End of the Old Order. p. 389 Napoleon had little accurate information about Mack's intentions or maneuvers; he knew that Kienmayer's Corps was sent to Ingolstadt east of the French positions, but his agents greatly exaggerated its size.Kagan p. 393 On 5 October Napoleon ordered Ney to join Lannes, Soult, and Murat in concentrating and crossing the Danube at Donauw√∂rth.Kagan p. 395 The French encirclement, however, was not deep enough to prevent Kienmayer's escape: the French corps did not all arrive at the same place ‚Äì they instead deployed on a long west-east axis ‚Äì and the early arrival of Soult and Davout at Donauw√∂rth incited Kienmayer to exercise caution and evasion. Napoleon gradually became more convinced that the Austrians were massed at Ulm and ordered sizeable portions of the French army to concentrate around Donauw√∂rth; on 6 October three French infantry and cavalry corps headed to Donauw√∂rth to seal off Mack's escape route.Kagan p. 397 Realizing the danger of his position, Mack decided to go on the offensive. On 8 October he commanded the army to concentrate around G√ºnzburg and hoped to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication. Mack instructed Kienmayer to draw Napoleon further east towards Munich and Augsburg. Napoleon did not seriously consider the possibility that Mack would cross the Danube and move away from his central base, but he did realize that seizing the bridges at G√ºnzburg would yield a large strategic advantage.Kagan p. 400 To accomplish this objective, Napoleon sent Ney's Corps to G√ºnzburg, completely unaware that the bulk of the Austrian army was heading to the same destination. On 8 October, however, the campaign witnessed its first serious battle at Wertingen between Auffenburg's troops and those of Murat and Lannes. Battle of Wertingen Battle of G√ºnzburg, 9 October 1805 For reasons not entirely clear, on 7 October Mack ordered Franz Xavier Auffenburg to take his division of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry from G√ºnzburg to Wertingen in preparation for the main Austrian advance out of Ulm.Kagan p. 402 Uncertain of what to do and having little hope for reinforcements, Auffenburg was in a dangerous position. The first French forces to arrive were Murat's cavalry divisions ‚Äì Louis Klein's 1st Dragoon Division, Marc Antoine de Beaumont's 3rd Dragoon Division, and Nansouty's 1st Cuirassier Division. They began to assault the Austrian positions and were soon joined by Nicolas Oudinot's grenadiers, who were hoping to outflank the Austrians from the northeast. Auffenburg attempted a retreat to the southwest, but he was not quick enough: the Austrians lost nearly their entire force, 1,000 to 2,000 of which were taken prisoner.Kagan p. 404 The Battle of Wertingen had been an easy French victory. Mikhail Kutuzov too far away to offer significant aid, the Austrians find themselves in a precarious position. The action at Wertingen convinced Mack to operate on the left (north) bank of the Danube instead of making a direct eastwards retreat on the right bank. This would require the Austrian army to cross to the north at G√ºnzburg. On 8 October Ney was operating under Louis Alexandre Berthier's directions that called for a direct attack on Ulm the following day. Ney sent in Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's 3rd Division to capture the G√ºnzburg bridges over the Danube. In the Battle of G√ºnzburg, a column of this division ran into some Tyrolean jaegers and captured 200 of them, including their commander Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspr√©, along with two cannons.Kagan p. 408 The Austrians noticed these developments and reinforced their positions around G√ºnzburg with three infantry battalions and 20 cannons. Malher's division conducted several heroic attacks against the Austrian positions, but all failed. Mack then sent in Ignaz Gyulai with seven infantry battalions and fourteen cavalry squadrons to repair the destroyed bridges, but this force was charged and swept away by the delayed French 59th Infantry Regiment.Kagan p. 409 Fierce fighting ensued and the French finally managed to establish a foothold on the right (south) bank of the Danube. While the Battle of G√ºnzburg was being fought, Ney sent Louis Henri Loison's 2nd Division to capture the Danube bridges at Elchingen, which were lightly defended by the Austrians. Having lost most of the Danube bridges, Mack marched his army back to Ulm. By 10 October Ney's corps had made significant progress: Malher's 3rd division had crossed to the right (south) bank, Loison's 2nd division held Elchingen, and Pierre Dupont de l'√âtang's 1st Division was heading towards Ulm. Haslach-Jungingen and Elchingen The strategic situation from 11 to 14 October. The French hurl themselves westwards to capture the Austrian army. The demoralized Austrian army arrived at Ulm in the early hours of 10 October. Mack was deliberating his course of action and the Austrian army remained inactive at Ulm until the 11th. Meanwhile, Napoleon was operating under flawed assumptions: he believed the Austrians were moving to the east or southeast and that Ulm was lightly guarded. Ney sensed this misapprehension and wrote to Berthier that Ulm was, in fact, more heavily defended than the French originally thought.Kagan p. 412 During this time, the Russian threat to the east began to preoccupy Napoleon so much that Murat was given command of the right wing of the army, consisting of Ney's and Lannes's corps.Kagan p. 414 The French were separated in two massive wings at this point: the forces of Ney, Lannes, and Murat to the west were containing Mack while those of Soult, Davout, Bernadotte, and Auguste Marmont to the east were charged with guarding against any possible Russian and Austrian incursions. On 11 October Ney made a renewed push on Ulm; the 2nd and 3rd divisions were to march to the city along the right bank of the Danube while Dupont's division, supported by one dragoon division, was to march directly for Ulm and seize the entire city. The orders were hopeless because Ney still did not know that the entire Austrian army was stationed at Ulm. The 32nd Infantry Regiment in Dupont's division marched from Haslach towards Ulm and ran into four Austrian regiments holding Boefingen. The 32nd carried out several ferocious attacks, but the Austrians held firm and repulsed every one. The Austrians flooded the battle with more cavalry and infantry regiments to Ulm-Jungingen hoping to score a knockout blow against Ney's corps by enveloping Dupont's force. Dupont sensed what was happening and preempted the Austrians by launching a surprise attack on Jungingen, during which he took as prisoner at least 1,000 of the Austrians.Kagan p. 415 Renewed Austrian attacks drove these forces back to Haslach, which the French managed to hold. Dupont was eventually forced to fall back on Albeck, where he joined Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers's foot dragoons division. The effects of the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on Napoleon's plans are not fully clear, but the Emperor may have finally ascertained that the majority of the Austrian army was concentrated at Ulm.Kagan p. 417 Accordingly, Napoleon sent the corps of Soult and Marmont towards the Iller, meaning he now had four infantry and one cavalry corps to deal with Mack; Davout, Bernadotte, and the Bavarians were still guarding the region around Munich. Napoleon did not intend to fight a battle across rivers and ordered his marshals to capture the important bridges around Ulm. He also began shifting his forces to the north of Ulm because he expected a battle in that region rather than an encirclement of the city itself.Kagan p. 420 These dispositions and actions would lead to a confrontation at Elchingen on the 14th as Ney's forces advanced on Albeck. At this point in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, charging that the latter spent his days writing contradictory orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth.Kagan p. 421 On 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes, The Napoleonic Wars: Rise and Fall of an Empire. p. 39‚Äì40 Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 40 The French cleared the Austrian pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey at the top of the hill at bayonet point. During the Battle of Elchingen, the Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title Duke of Elchingen for his impressive victory.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 41 Battle of Ulm Marshal Murat proved instrumental during the Ulm campaign. On 13 October Soult's IV Corps fell on Memmingen from the east. After a minor clash that resulted in 16 French casualties, General-Major Karl Spangen von Uyternesse surrendered 4,600 soldiers, eight guns, and nine colors. The Austrians were low on ammunition, cut off from Ulm, and completely demoralized by the confusion reigning at army headquarters.Smith, p 204 Mack surrenders to Napoleon at Ulm by Paul-√âmile Boutigny More actions took place on the 14th. Murat's forces joined Dupont at Albeck just in time to drive off an Austrian attack from Werneck; together Murat and Dupont beat the Austrians to the north in the direction of Heidenheim. By night on the 14th, two French corps were stationed in the vicinity of the Austrian encampments at Michelsberg, right outside of Ulm.David Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 399 Mack was now in a dangerous situation: there was no longer any hope of escaping along the north bank, Marmont and the Imperial Guard were hovering at the outskirts of Ulm to the south of the river, and Soult was moving north from Memmingen to prevent the Austrians escaping south to the Tyrol. Troubles continued with the Austrian command as Ferdinand overrode the objections of Mack and ordered the evacuation of all cavalry from Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers.Chandler p. 400 Murat's pursuit was so effective, however, that only eleven squadrons joined Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat continued his harassment of Werneck and forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at Treuchtlingen on 19 October; Murat also took an entire Austrian field park of 500 vehicles, then swept on towards Neustadt an der Donau and captured 12,000 Austrians.Chandler says Trochtelfingen but this cannot possibly be correct because it is 55 km to the west of Ulm. On the other hand, Treuchtlingen is a far better candidate since it is in the expected direction, that is, 48 km northeast of Neresheim and 91 km northeast of Ulm. Chandler also names Neustadt, which could be either Neustadt am der Donau (148 km east of Ulm!) or a mistake. Events at Ulm were now reaching a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments and on the 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack began to realize that there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, S√©gur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, but the vast majority of the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Arm√©e drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai. DOUZI√àME BULLETIN DE LA GRANDE ARM√âE. Status of Austrian officers and general officers, after the affaires d‚ÄôElchingen, Wertingen, Memmingen, Ulm, etc. Munich, Munich, 5 brumaire an 14 (27 octobre 1805.) Histoire-Empire.org. May 6, 2010. Aftermath On 2 December 1805 the French crushed a combined Russo-Austrian army in the Battle of Austerlitz. Austria agreed to end her participation in the Third Coalition with the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December. As the Austrians were marching out of Ulm to surrender, a combined Franco-Spanish fleet was being destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar. This decisive British victory ended the naval threat from France and ensured British naval domination for the next century. Despite this setback, the Ulm campaign had been a spectacular victory and had witnessed the elimination of an entire Austrian army at very little cost for the French. The 8th bulletin of the Grande Arm√©e described the scale of the achievement: Marshal Augereau's arrival from Brest with the newly formed VII Corps gave the French one more piece of good news. In the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November, Franjo Jelaƒçiƒá's division was cornered and forced to surrender. The Russians withdrew to the northeast after Mack's capitulation and Vienna fell on 12 November. The Allies were thoroughly defeated at the Battle of Austerlitz in December and Austria was permanently knocked out of the Third Coalition a few weeks later. The French victory highlighted the effectiveness of la manoeuvre sur les derri√®res, a special type of strategic envelopment first used by Napoleon in his Italian campaign in 1796. The maneuver called for a pinning force that would occupy a broad front of the enemy line while other supporting units positioned themselves at a specific location in the enemy's flank or rear.Chandler p. 186 As the enemy became more embroiled with the pinning force, the flanking troops would attack at a critical spot and seal the victory. In the Ulm campaign, Murat's cavalry served as the pinning force that fooled the Austrians into thinking the main French attack would come from the Black Forest. As Murat lulled the Austrians towards Ulm, the main French forces crashed through Central Germany and separated Mack's army from the other theaters of the war. Significance The Schlieffen Plan, emphasizing maneuver and envelopment, owed much to the Ulm campaign. The Ulm campaign is considered to be one of the greatest historical examples of a strategic turning movement.Trevor Dupuy, Harper Encyclopedia of Military History. p. 816. Ulm was not a battle; it was a strategic victory so complete and so overwhelming that the issue was never seriously contested in tactical combat. Also, This campaign opened the most brilliant year of Napoleon's career. His army had been trained to perfection; his plans were faultless. Historians often analyze the campaign on a wide strategic level that does not include tactical confrontations, even though these were common and relevant. The decisive victory at Ulm is also believed to be a product of the long training and preparation the Grande Arm√©e received at the camps of Boulogne. The Grande Arm√©e carried little baggage, invaded enemy territory at harvest time, and marched far faster than the Austrians had expected.Richard Brooks (editor), Atlas of World Military History. p. 108 The campaign highlighted the utility of the Corps d'Arm√©e system; corps went on to become the fundamental strategic building block for the major wars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Brooks (editor) p. 109 A typical corps might have three infantry divisions, a light cavalry brigade for reconnaissance, and reserve artillery batteries in addition to those attached to each division; their increased size allowed them to fight without support for long periods of time, as Ney did, and their durability permitted them to spread out and subsist by requisitioning local food. The French needed about one eighth the transport used by contemporary armies, giving them a level of mobility and flexibility unseen at that time: invasions of South Germany by Marlborough or Moreau covered a narrow front, but the Grande Arm√©e invaded in 1805 on a front that was wide, an action that took the Austrians by complete surprise and caused them to underestimate the gravity of the situation. Popular Culture The campaign is included in Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. Notes References * Brooks, Richard (editor). Atlas of World Military History.

The short subject makes light of the rash of foreclosures and property auctions in the economic turmoil of the Great Depression, together with some of the distinctive surrealism of the Fleischer style of this era. Plot A destitute Betty is evicted from her home, which has a \\"FOR SALE\\" sign beside it. After Bimbo hauls away Betty and her meager belongings in a horse-drawn cart, the vacant house starts to fall apart. The asking price on the sign goes down with each additional decay, which the chimney itself fixes, until the house is ramshackle and the asking price is \\"Or what have you?\\", which frustrates the chimney. The camera view then pulls back up into the air, showing all the houses in the town also have \\"For Sale\\" signs. The view continues up show all of North America \\"For Sale\\", and finally the whole Earth is for sale. The Earth goes up for auction with the Moon serving as auctioneer and the planets start bidding, singing to the tune of \\"London Bridge Is Falling Down\\". Mars and Venus bid first, but Saturn is the eventual buyer. He pulls a large horse-shoe magnet out from the Earth, eliminating the planet's gravity, just to see what happens. Buildings, trees, animals, and people including Betty start floating into the air with humorous effect. Finally a hand reaches out from the Earth and grabs the magnet back from Saturn.

Simulace pro ekonomy. Praha : V≈†E, 2005. Realizations of these random variables are generated and inserted into a model of the system. Outputs of the model are recorded, and then the process is repeated with a new set of random values. These steps are repeated until a sufficient amount of data is gathered. In the end, the distribution of the outputs shows the most probable estimates as well as a frame of expectations regarding what ranges of values the variables are more or less likely to fall in. Often random variables inserted into the model are created on a computer with a random number generator (RNG). The U(0,1) uniform distribution outputs of the random number generator are then transformed into random variables with probability distributions that are used in the system model. Etymology Stochastic originally meant \\"pertaining to conjecture\\"; from Greek stokhastikos \\"able to guess, conjecturing\\": from stokhazesthai \\"guess\\"; from stokhos \\"a guess, aim, target, mark\\". The sense of \\"randomly determined\\" was first recorded in 1934, from German Stochastik.stochastic. (n.d.). Online Etymology Dictionary. Retrieved January 23, 2014, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stochastic Discrete-event simulation In order to determine the next event in a stochastic simulation, the rates of all possible changes to the state of the model are computed, and then ordered in an array. Next, the cumulative sum of the array is taken, and the final cell contains the number R, where R is the total event rate. This cumulative array is now a discrete cumulative distribution, and can be used to choose the next event by picking a random number z~U(0,R) and choosing the first event, such that z is less than the rate associated with that event. Probability distributions A probability distribution is used to describe the potential outcome of a random variable. Limits the outcomes where the variable can only take on discrete values.Rachev, Svetlozar T. Stoyanov, Stoyan V. Fabozzi, Frank J., \\"Chapter 1 Concepts of Probability\\" in Advanced Stochastic Models, Risk Assessment, and Portfolio Optimization : The Ideal Risk, Uncertainty, and Performance Measures, Hoboken, NJ, USA: Wiley, 2008 Bernoulli distribution A random variable X is Bernoulli-distributed with parameter p if it has two possible outcomes usually encoded 1 (success or default) or 0 (failure or survival) where the probabilities of success and failure are P(X = 1) = p and P(X = 0) = 1 - p where 0 \\\\leq p \\\\leq 1. To produce a random variable X with a Bernoulli distribution from a U(0,1) uniform distribution made by a random number generator, we define X = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\text{if } 0 \\\\leq U < p \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{if } 1 \\\\geq U \\\\geq p \\\\end{cases} such that the probability forP(X = 1) = P(0 \\\\leq U < p) = pand P(X = 0) = P(1 \\\\geq U \\\\geq p) = 1 - p. = Example: Toss of coin = Define X = 1 if head comes up and X = 0 if tail comes up For a fair coin, both realizations are equally likely. We can generate realizations of this random variable X from a U(1,0) uniform distribution provided by a random number generator (RNG) by having X = 1 if the RNG outputs a value between 0 and 0.5 andX = 0 if the RNG outputs a value between 0.5 and 1. P (X = 1) = P(0 ‚â§ U < 1/2) = 1/2 P (X = 0) = P(1 ‚â• U ‚â• 1/2) = 1/2 Of course, the two outcomes may not be equally likely (e.g. success of medical treatment).Bernoulli Distribution, The University of Chicago - Department of Statistics, [online] available at http://galton.uchicago.edu/~eichler/stat22000/Handouts/l12.pdf Binomial distribution A binomial distributed random variable Y with parameters n and p is obtained as the sum of n independent and identically Bernoulli-distributed random variables X1, X2, ..., Xn Example: A coin is tossed three times. Find the probability of getting exactly two heads. This problem can be solved by looking at the sample space. There are three ways to get two heads. HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT The answer is 3/8 (= 0.375). Poisson distribution A poisson process is a process where events occur randomly in an interval of time or space. The probability distribution for poisson processes with constant rate Œª per time interval is given by the following equation. P(k \\\\text{ events in interval}) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^k e^{-\\\\lambda}}{k!} Defining N(t) as the number of events that occur in the time interval t P(N(t) = k) = \\\\frac{(t\\\\lambda)^{k}}{k!}e^{-t\\\\lambda} It can be shown that inter-arrival times for events is exponentially distributed with a cumulative distribution function(CDF) of F(t) = 1 - e^{{-t}{\\\\lambda}}. The inverse of the exponential CDF is given by t = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}ln(u) where u is an U(0,1) uniformly distributed random variable. Simulating a Poisson process with a constant rate \\\\lambda for the number of events N that occur in interval [t_{start},t_{end}] can be carried out with the following algorithm. # Begin with N = 0 and t = t_{start} # Generate random variable u from U(0,1) uniform distribution # Update the time with t = t + (-1/\\\\lambda)ln(u) # If t > t_{end}, then stop. Else continue to step 5. # N = N + 1 # Continue to step 2 Methods Direct and first reaction methods Published by Dan Gillespie in 1977, and is a linear search on the cumulative array. See Gillespie algorithm. Gillespie‚Äôs Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) is essentially an exact procedure for numerically simulating the time evolution of a well-stirred chemically reacting system by taking proper account of the randomness inherent in such a system.Stephen Gilmore, An Introduction to Stochastic Simulation - Stochastic Simulation Algorithms, University of Edinburgh, [online] available at http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~jb/conferences/pasta2006/slides/stochastic- simulation-introduction.pdf It is rigorously based on the same microphysical premise that underlies the chemical master equation and gives a more realistic representation of a system‚Äôs evolution than the deterministic reaction rate equation (RRE) represented mathematically by ODEs. As with the chemical master equation, the SSA converges, in the limit of large numbers of reactants, to the same solution as the law of mass action. Next reaction method Published 2000 by Gibson and BruckM A Gibson and J Bruck, Efficient exact stochastic simulation of chemical systems with many specias and many channels, J. Comp Phys., 104:1876‚Äì1899, 2000.. This is an improvement over the first reaction method where the unused reaction times are reused. To make the sampling of reactions more efficient, an indexed priority queue is used to store the reaction times. On the other hand, to make the recomputation of propensities more efficient, a dependency graph is used. This dependency graph tells which reaction propensities to update after a particular reaction has fired. Optimised and sorting direct methods Published 2004Y. Cao, H. Li, and L. Petzold. Efficient formulation of the stochastic simulation algorithm for chemically reacting systems, J. Chem. Phys, 121(9):4059‚Äì4067, 2004. and 2005. These methods sort the cumulative array to reduce the average search depth of the algorithm. The former runs a presimulation to estimate the firing frequency of reactions, whereas the latter sorts the cumulative array on-the-fly. Logarithmic direct method Published in 2006. This is a binary search on the cumulative array, thus reducing the worst-case time complexity of reaction sampling to O (log M). Partial-propensity methods Published in 2009, 2010, and 2011 (Ramaswamy 2009, 2010, 2011). Use factored-out, partial reaction propensities to reduce the computational cost to scale with the number of species in the network, rather than the (larger) number of reactions. Four variants exist: * PDM, the partial- propensity direct method. Has a computational cost that scales linearly with the number of different species in the reaction network, independent of the coupling class of the network (Ramaswamy 2009). * SPDM, the sorting partial- propensity direct method. Uses dynamic bubble sort to reduce the pre-factor of the computational cost in multi-scale reaction networks where the reaction rates span several orders of magnitude (Ramaswamy 2009). * PSSA-CR, the partial-propensity SSA with composition-rejection sampling. Reduces the computational cost to constant time (i.e., independent of network size) for weakly coupled networks (Ramaswamy 2010) using composition-rejection sampling (Slepoy 2008). * dPDM, the delay partial-propensity direct method. Extends PDM to reaction networks that incur time delays (Ramaswamy 2011) by providing a partial-propensity variant of the delay-SSA method (Bratsun 2005, Cai 2007). The use of partial-propensity methods is limited to elementary chemical reactions, i.e., reactions with at most two different reactants. Every non- elementary chemical reaction can be equivalently decomposed into a set of elementary ones, at the expense of a linear (in the order of the reaction) increase in network size. Approximate Methods A general drawback of stochastic simulations is that for big systems, too many events happen which cannot all be taken into account in a simulation. The following methods can dramatically improve simulation speed by some approximations. œÑ leaping method Since the SSA method keeps track of each transition, it would be impractical to implement for certain applications due to high time complexity. Gillespie proposed an approximation procedure, the tau-leaping method which decreases computational time with minimal loss of accuracy. Instead of taking incremental steps in time, keeping track of X(t) at each time step as in the SSA method, the tau-leaping method leaps from one subinterval to the next, approximating how many transitions take place during a given subinterval. It is assumed that the value of the leap, œÑ, is small enough that there is no significant change in the value of the transition rates along the subinterval [t, t + œÑ]. This condition is known as the leap condition. The tau-leaping method thus has the advantage of simulating many transitions in one leap while not losing significant accuracy, resulting in a speed up in computational time.H.T. Banks, Anna Broido, Brandi Canter, Kaitlyn Gayvert,Shuhua Hu, Michele Joyner, Kathryn Link, Simulation Algorithms for Continuous Time Markov Chain Models, [online] available at http://www.ncsu.edu/crsc/reports/ftp/pdf/crsc-tr11-17.pdf Conditional Difference Method This method approximates reversible processes (which includes random walk/diffusion processes) by taking only net rates of the opposing events of a reversible process into account. The main advantage of this method is that it can be implemented with a simple if-statement replacing the previous transition rates of the model with new, effective rates. The model with the replaced transition rates can thus be solved, for instance, with the conventional SSA. Continuous simulation  While in discrete state space it is clearly distinguished between particular states (values) in continuous space it is not possible due to certain continuity. The system usually change over time, variables of the model, then change continuously as well. Continuous simulation thereby simulates the system over time, given differential equations determining the rates of change of state variables.Crespo-M√°rquez, A., R. R. Usano and R. D. Aznar, 1993, \\"Continuous and Discrete Simulation in a Production Planning System. A Comparative Study\\" Example of continuous system is the predator/prey modelLouis G. Birta, Gilbert Arbez (2007). Modelling and Simulation, p. 255. Springer. or cart-pole balancing Probability distributions Normal distribution The random variable X is said to be normally distributed with parameters Œº and œÉ, abbreviated by X ‚àà N (Œº, œÉ2), if the density of the random variable is given by the formula f_X(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}} e^{ -\\\\frac{(x-\\\\mu)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2} }. x ‚àà R. Many things actually are normally distributed, or very close to it. For example, height and intelligence are approximately normally distributed; measurement errors also often have a normal distribution.University of Notre Dame, Normal Distribution, [online] available at http://www3.nd.edu/~rwilliam/stats1/x21.pdf Exponential distribution Exponential distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson process, i.e. a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. The exponential distribution is popular, for example, in queuing theory when we want to model the time we have to wait until a certain event takes place. Examples include the time until the next client enters the store, the time until a certain company defaults or the time until some machine has a defect. Student's t-distribution Student's t-distribution are used in finance as probabilistic models of assets returns. The density function of the t-distribution is given by the following equation: f(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{ u+1}{2})} {\\\\sqrt{ u\\\\pi}\\\\,\\\\Gamma(\\\\frac{ u}{2})} \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{t^2}{ u} \\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{ u+1}{2}},\\\\\\\\! where u is the number of degrees of freedom and \\\\Gamma is the gamma function. For large values of n, the t-distribution doesn't significantly differ from a standard normal distribution. Usually, for values n > 30, the t-distribution is considered as equal to the standard normal distribution. Other distributions * Generalized extreme value distribution Combined simulation It is often possible to model one and the same system by use of completely different world views. Discrete event simulation of a problem as well as continuous event simulation of it (continuous simulation with the discrete events that disrupt the continuous flow) may lead eventually to the same answers. Sometimes however, the techniques can answer different questions about a system. If we necessarily need to answer all the questions, or if we don't know what purposes is the model going to be used for, it is convenient to apply combined continuous/discrete methodology.Francois E. Cellier, Combined Continuous/Discrete Simulation Applications, Techniques, and Tools Similar techniques can change from a discrete, stochastic description to a deterministic, continuum description in a time-and space dependent manner. The use of this technique enables the capturing of noise due to small copy numbers, while being much faster to simulate than the conventional Gillespie algorithm. Furthermore, the use of the deterministic continuum description enables the simulations of arbitrarily large systems. Monte Carlo simulation Monte Carlo is an estimation procedure. The main idea is that if it is necessary to know the average value of some random variable and its distribution cannot be stated, and if it is possible to take samples from the distribution, we can estimate it by taking the samples, independently, and averaging them. If there are sufficient samples, then the law of large numbers says the average must be close to the true value. The central limit theorem says that the average has a Gaussian distribution around the true value.Cosma Rohilla Shalizi, Monte Carlo, and Other Kinds of Stochastic Simulation, [online] available at http://bactra.org/notebooks/monte-carlo.html As a simple example, suppose we need to measure area of a shape with a complicated, irregular outline. The Monte Carlo approach is to draw a square around the shape and measure the square. Then we throw darts into the square, as uniformly as possible. The fraction of darts falling on the shape gives the ratio of the area of the shape to the area of the square. In fact, it is possible to cast almost any integral problem, or any averaging problem, into this form. It is necessary to have a good way to tell if you're inside the outline, and a good way to figure out how many darts to throw. Last but not least, we need to throw the darts uniformly, i.e., using a good random number generator. Application There are wide possibilities for use of Monte Carlo Method: * Statistic experiment using generation of random variables (e.g. dice) * sampling method * Mathematics (e.g. numerical integration, multiple integrals) * Reliability Engineering * Project Management (SixSigma) * Experimental particle physics * Simulations * Risk Measurement/Risk Management (e.g. Portfolio value estimation) * Economics (e.g. finding the best fitting demand curve) * Process Simulation * Operations Research Random number generators For simulation experiments (including Monte Carlo) it is necessary to generate random numbers (as values of variables). The problem is that the computer is highly deterministic machine‚Äîbasically, behind each process there is always an algorithm, a deterministic computation changing inputs to outputs; therefore it is not easy to generate uniformly spread random numbers over a defined interval or set. A random number generator is a device capable of producing a sequence of numbers which cannot be \\"easily\\" identified with deterministic properties. This sequence is then called a sequence of stochastic numbers.Donald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms - chapitre 3 : Random Numbers (Addison-Wesley, Boston, 1998). The algorithms typically rely on pseudorandom numbers, computer generated numbers mimicking true random numbers, to generate a realization, one possible outcome of a process.Andreas hellander, Stochastic Simulation and Monte Carlo Methods, [online] available at http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/bervet2/MCkompendium/mc.pdf Methods for obtaining random numbers have existed for a long time and are used in many different fields (such as gaming). However, these numbers suffer from a certain bias. Currently the best methods expected to produce truly random sequences are natural methods that take advantage of the random nature of quantum phenomena.

Dekel is known for his contributions to research in cosmology, especially the study of the formation of galaxies and large-scale structure in the Universe, which is dominated by dark energy and dark matter. His expertise is dwarf galaxies and supernova feedback (1986, 2003), large-scale cosmic flows and early estimates of fundamental cosmological parameters (1989-2001), the structure of dark-matter galactic halos (2000‚Äì2003), and the theory of galaxy formation (2003‚Äì2012). His research focuses on galaxy formation in its most active phase at the early universe, using analytic models and computer simulations. He studies how continuous streams of cold gas and merging galaxies from the cosmic web lead to star-forming disks and drive violent gravitational disk instability, and how this instability leads to the formation of compact spheroidal galactic components with central massive black holes.

This volume includes a new story that is a sequel to the extra story Child Rock. Plot summary The story is set in prehistory, involving two rival tribes, the East Forest Tribe and the Lakeside Tribe and the budding romance between the leaders' sons, Emba and Yuuen. The book is divided into three parts: The first focuses on Emba and Yuuen. Yuuen is the second son to the East Forest Chief, Yuni, and seems incapable of aiding his tribe with the hunting. As they lose more of their game to the Lakeside Tribe, most specifically that Tribe heir Emba, Yuni forces Yuuen to act and gain Emba's favor, thus giving their Tribe a chance to hunt. Yuuen is thus required to dress as a woman (as he has effeminate features) and distract Emba. However, both young men fall in love with each other for real and Yuuen grows increasingly guilty at deceiving Emba. This guilt nearly consumes him when Emba becomes seriously injured saving his life, and much is left to wonder if they will ever be together, coming from different tribes and Yuuen supposedly getting Emba's attention by pretending to be a girl. The second story, Innocent Lies, is a prequal to the first story, following Yuni and Emba's father Selem as younger men. The two meet when Yuni falls into an animal trap set up by Selem and they are forced into each other's company as Selem nurses him back to health. While Selem is aware that Yuni is the heir to the East Forest Tribe, Yuni doesn't know at first that Selem is the heir to the Lakeside Tribe. As they spend more time with each other, the feelings between them grow stronger in spite of the positions the two of them are in. Sadly, even as they acknowledge their feelings, neither man is willing to turn his back on his fate. The third story, Child Rock, takes place some years after the events in Wild Rock, as Yuuen and Emba spend the day together babysitting their baby nephew Nava (the child of Yuuen's brother and Emba's sister). Drama CD In November 2002, a drama cd of Wild Rock was released in Japan. The cd follows the events of the original manga very closely, however the tracks go in chronological order of the story, starting with Innocent Lies, then Wild Rock and finally Child Rock. Japanese voice actors: Yuuen: Jun Fukuyama Emba: Toshiyuki Morikawa Yuni (younger): Yamaguchi Kappei Selem (younger): Shin-ichiro Miki Yuni (older): Inoue Kazuhiko Selem (older): Kosugi Juurouta Yuuli (Yuuen's older brother): Takahashi Hiroki Reception The reviewer for Manga-News notes that while the story of two enemies who fall in love is classical, Wild Rock innovates by setting this story in prehistoric times, noting that this allows the author to draw many bare-chested young men while also divorcing the story from expectations for the genre.Manga News review Julie Rosato felt the work was \\"undeniably sexy\\" and that it did not rely on explicit acts to be so, praising Blu for getting the license to this fan-favourite work.Mania review References External links *Comics Village review * Category:Historical anime and manga Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Yaoi anime and manga ","title":"Wild Rock"},{"id":"7210228","title":"1965 Minnesota Twins season"},{"id":"7210258","text":"Harriett Everard as Little Buttercup in H.M.S.

Pinafore when it opened in May 1878, playing the role for the duration of the long run, until February 1880.Rollins and Witts, p. 6 The character, described as a Bumboat woman, regretfully reveals a key secret that sets up the ending of the opera: as a wetnurse many years before the time of the opera, she had mixed up two babies, one who became the captain of the Pinafore, and the other who became a sailor on board his ship, who is caught eloping with the captain's daughter.Bradley, p. 179 During a scuffle at the Opera Comique, early in the run of Pinafore, when Carte's former backers tried to seize the scenery and properties during a performance and were repelled by the backstage crew, Everard earned admiration for carrying on bravely with the show.Article entitled \\"The Assault on The Opera Comique,\\" at the Stagebeauty website Everard was next cast to play Ruth in The Pirates of Penzance, when she became the victim of an accident during rehearsals for the piece. Rutland Barrington was a witness to the incident and later described it thus: As a consequence, Everard missed the opening performance on 3 April 1880, being replaced as Ruth by Emily Cross. Although she was able to assume the role in June, her run did not last long - she turned the part over to Alice Barnett in July when the company returned to England from its New York production. Everard then left the company and continued to work for only the next several months; her last recorded appearance was as Aunt Priscilla de Montmorency in Francis Marshall's comic opera Lola in January 1881.\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 22 January 1881, p. 7 Everard died just over a year later, in London, at the age of 37, apparently having never completely recovered from the accident, although some sources report that she died of consumption.The Era, 25 February 1882, p. 8 In 1879 she had married again (or for the first time, if her first marriage was never sanctified) to a commission agent, George William Darley Beswick, a man seven years her junior.

He was nicknamed The Torso Killer due to his habit of dismembering his victims, usually leaving nothing but a torso behind. He was eventually convicted of murder in 1981, after being caught fleeing an attempted murder. Officially, Cottingham killed nine people, but he claims between 85 and 100 murders.https://www6.state.nj.us/DOC_Inmate/details?x=1053631&n;=0 Cottingham is incarcerated in New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey. Early life and education Cottingham was born Richard Francis Cottingham on November 25, 1946, in The Bronx, New York City, the first of three children. In 1958, when Richard was 12, his family moved to River Vale, New Jersey. In 1964, Cottingham graduated from Pascack Valley High School, in Hillsdale, New Jersey. After graduating, he worked for his father at Metropolitan Life Insurance Company until 1966 as a computer operator, while taking computer courses. Career Cottingham was a computer operator, and a well-liked employee at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in New York from 1966 until his arrest. Marriage and children On May 3, 1970, Richard married his wife Janet at Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Queens Village, New York. First arrest and subsequent minor offenses Cottingham was arrested for several minor charges throughout his killing spree; the police were not aware of his murders at the time. On October 3, 1969, he was charged and convicted of intoxicated driving in New York City, and sentenced to 10 days in jail & a $50 fine. On August 21, 1972, Cottingham was charged and convicted of shoplifting at Stern‚Äôs Department Store in Paramus, New Jersey and was sentenced to pay a $50 fine. Killing spree Cottingham's first known murder was the 1967 slaying of Nancy Schiava Vogel. The 29-year-old married mother of two was strangled, and her nude, bound body was found in her car in nearby Ridgefield Park, New Jersey. She had last been seen three days earlier, when she left home to play bingo with friends at a local church. On December 2, 1979, firemen in New York responded to an alarm at a hotel near Times Square. When they forced their way inside and put the fire out they found two corpses. Both bodies had their hands and heads removed. They had been doused with lighter fluid and set alight. The missing body parts were never found. One victim was identified as Deedeh Goodarzi, 22, an immigrant from Kuwait who was working as a sex worker. The other corpse was never identified. Homicide detectives linked the murder with that of the murder of teenager Helen Sikes who had gone missing from Times Square in January 1979. On May 5, 1980, police found the body of nineteen-year-old Valerie Ann Street in a Quality Inn in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The victim‚Äôs hands were tightly handcuffed behind her back. She was covered in bite marks and was beaten across the shins. Street had died of asphyxiation and traces of adhesive tape were found on her mouth. This murder was linked to an earlier murder in the same motel. Twenty-six- year-old radiologist Maryann Carr was also found brutally beaten near the same hotel, but police could not positively link the crimes. On May 15, Jean Reyner was stabbed to death in the historic Seville Hotel. In 2020, Cottingham admitted to killing an additional three women (Jacalyn Harp, of Midland Park; Irene Blase, of Bogota; and Denise Falasco, of Closter, all of whom were strangled in the late 1960s). Arrest On May 22, 1980, Cottingham picked up eighteen-year-old Leslie Ann O‚ÄôDell, who was soliciting on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 25th Street. At some point she agreed to have sex with him for $100. Around dawn, they checked into the same Hasbrouck Heights Quality Inn where he had left his last mutilated victim. Cottingham offered to give the girl a massage and she rolled over onto her stomach. Straddling her back, he drew a knife and put it to her throat as he snapped a pair of handcuffs on her wrists. He began torturing her, nearly biting off one of her nipples. She later testified that he said, ‚ÄúYou have to take it. The other girls did, you have to take it too. You‚Äôre a whore and you have to be punished.‚Äù The charges listed in Cottingham‚Äôs New Jersey indictment included kidnapping, attempted murder, aggravated assault, aggravated assault with deadly weapon, aggravated sexual assault while armed (rape), aggravated sexual assault while armed (sodomy), aggravated sexual assault while armed (fellatio), possession of a weapon, possession of controlled dangerous substances, Secobarbital and Amobarbital, or Tuinal, and possession of controlled dangerous substance, Diazepam or Valium. O‚ÄôDell‚Äôs muffled cries of pain became so loud that the motel staff, already spooked by the murder eighteen days earlier, called police and then rushed to the room demanding that Cottingham open the door. Cottingham was apprehended by arriving police officers in the hallway. When arrested he had handcuffs, a leather gag, two slave collars, a switchblade, replica pistols and a stockpile of prescription pills. At his house he had a trophy room where he kept personal effects from some of his victims. Trials A strong case was built against Cottingham due to the testimony of three surviving victims. He was eventually found guilty of murdering Valerie Streets, drawing a sentence of 173 to 197 years in prison. In two following trials he was found guilty of four second degree murders.

The original plays covered eight separate stories, which have been pared down to three each for these movies.

He was born in Portland, Oregon and died in Reno, Nevada. He was born into a Polish farmer family (Edward Winter has quoted a mistaken statement with Dake's name on a list of chess players with Jewish roots), who immigrated to America before World War I. At age 16 he became a merchant seaman, traveling to Japan, China, and the Philippines. In 1927 he returned to high school in Oregon and learned chess from a Russian immigrant living in a local YMCA. He resumed work as a sailor and landed in New York City in 1929. New York was the center of chess in the U.S. at that time, and Dake teamed with leading checkers player Kenneth Grover in a Coney Island chess and checkers stand that accepted any challenger at 25 cents a game. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 made that business unviable. Dake's first chess tournament was the 1930 New York State Championship, in which he finished third. In 1931 he won the championship of the Marshall Chess Club. The Great Depression years saw unparalleled U.S. dominance of world chess competition. When US teams won four consecutive Chess Olympiads in 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1937, Dake who played in 1931‚Äì1935 was one of their major members, along with Isaac Kashdan, Frank Marshall, Reuben Fine, Israel Horowitz, and Abraham Kupchik, winning two individual medals: silver (1933) and gold (1935). * In 1931, on third board in 4th Chess Olympiad in Prague (+5 ‚Äì2 =7). * In 1933, on fourth board in 5th Chess Olympiad in Folkestone (+9 ‚Äì2 =2). * In 1935, on fourth board in 6th Chess Olympiad in Warsaw (+13 ‚Äì0 =5).OlimpBase :: the encyclopaedia of team chess In 1931, Dake tied for 1st-3rd with Akiba Rubinstein and Frederick Yates, in Antwerp. In 1932, he tied for 3rd-5th, after Alexander Alekhine and Kashdan, in Pasadena. He defeated World Champion Alekhine in their game at Pasadena, becoming the first American to do so. In 1934, he took 3rd in the U.S. Open Chess Championship. In 1934, he tied for 3rd-4th in Syracuse (Samuel Reshevsky won). In 1934, he tied for 2nd-3rd in the Manhattan Chess Club Championship. In 1934/35, he tied for 1st-3rd with Kashdan and Fine in Mexico City. In 1935, he took 2nd, behind Fine, in the U.S. Open. In 1936, he tied for 6-7th in the first U.S. Championship. In 1936, he tied for 2nd-3rd, behind Horowitz, in the U.S. Open. In 1938, he tied for 6-7th in the second U.S. Championship. He had met his wife Helen on the return ocean liner trip from Warsaw in 1935. During the worldwide depression they moved back to Portland, where Dake had a career with the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles for more than 30 years. Dake was a member of a U. S. Group which went to Moscow in 1946. He drew two games against Soviet grandmaster Andreas Lilienthal. In 1950, Dake played board 6 for the US in a radio match against Yugoslavia. He scored one draw and one loss against Stojan Puc. In 1952, he tied for 4th-5th in Hollywood (Svetozar Gligoriƒá won). In 1954, Dake lost one game to David Bronstein in USA - USSR Match. Except for the USA - Yugoslavia match Hollywood 1952, the USA - USSR Match, and various minor local events in the Pacific Northwest, Dake apparently played little serious competitive chess for 37 years, from the 1938 United States Championship until he unexpectedly showed up to play in Lone Pine 1975. In the 1987 US Open, held at Portland, Oregon, Dake's home town, he scored 8-4 (at the age of 77 !). He donated his personal chess library to the Portland Chess Club where he was an active member. He was awarded the International Master title in 1954, and received the honorary Grandmaster title in 1986 in recognition of his results in the 1930s. In 1991 he was inducted into the US Chess Hall of Fame. He was the oldest competitive chess grandmaster in history, and died in 2000 at age 90. Dake spent his last night playing blackjack in the Sands Regency Casino in Reno Nevada. He died of natural causes.The Week in Chess 287 Casey Bush wrote the book Grandmaster from Oregon on Dake's chess career and life.

It was released by Paramount Pictures on November 4, 1932, four days before that year's presidential election day. Plot Betty runs for the office of President against Mr. Nobody. Both candidates state their platform through song and dance. In answer to various problems and political issues, Mr. Nobody consistently promises that \\"nobody\\" will solve the problem: > Who will make your taxes light?... Mr. Nobody! > Who'll protect the voters' right?... Mr. Nobody! > Should you come home some early dawn, > See a new milkman is on: > Who cares if your wife is gone?... Mr. Nobody Betty's promises for improvements are shown, including door to door trolley stops, improved conditions for keeping the streets clean, and even a giant umbrella to protect the whole city from rain. Betty also promises to tame a split and incorrigible Congress made up of donkey Democrats and elephant Republicans, and offers a simple solution for prison reform: she will transform each hardened criminal into a limp-wristed sissy. Betty's campaign promises win the crowd over, and she is voted into the White House by a landslide. A large parade is held in the new President's honor, as she thanks one and all. Notes and comments * Betty Boop briefly morphs into caricatures of Herbert Hoover and Al Smith. Smith was the Democratic Party candidate in 1928 and was widely expected to run again, but the nominee would end up being Franklin D. Roosevelt. The use of Smith in the cartoon was probably the result in the lead time needed to animate the cartoon before it appeared in theaters. * The cartoon ends with the image of a glass of beer; repeal or modification of Prohibition in the United States was a major contemporary issue. *Betty Boop for President was reworked by the Fleischer staff sixteen years later, when the studio, by then known as Famous Studios, produced a Popeye the Sailor cartoon entitled Olive Oyl for President. This 1948 short reuses many of the gags, as well as a reworked version of Betty's \\"If I Were President\\" song, applying them to a fantasy story about Olive Oyl running for president. * The \\"Nobody for President\\" slogan was later taken up by hippie activist and entertainer Wavy Gravy. *The title was later used for a 1980 compilation film, Betty Boop for President. The compilation was originally titled \\"Hurray For Betty Boop\\" before being changed later.

Of Italian origin, he turned up in the bishopric of Cambrai-Arras in northern France (south of Lille) in 1025 when Bishop Gerard of Florennes discovered that there were heretics in the diocese.Steven Vanderputten and Diane J. Reilly, \\"Reconciliation and Record Keeping: Heresy, Secular Dissent and the Exercise of Episcopal Authority in Eleventh-Century Cambrai\\", Journal of Medieval History 37:4 (2011), 343‚Äì57. These heretics rejected the sacraments of the Catholic Church and claimed for themselves a righteousness by which alone men could be purified and attain salvation. Gundolfo taught that salvation was achieved through a virtuous life of abandoning the world, restraining the appetites of the flesh, earning food by the labor of hands, doing no injury to anyone, and extending charity to everyone of their own faith. They claimed that Gundolfo's teachings were based on the Gospels rather than on Catholic Church dogma. Following a lengthy sermon by Gerard, the heretics recanted their errors and were received back into the Church. The unknown source of Gundolfo's teachings may be compared to Catharism and to the Waldensians. His ultimate fate is unknown. References ;Notes ;Further reading *R. I.

The Memorial Human Rights Center also has documented numerous cases. The majority of the bodies showed close- range bullet wounds, typical of extrajudicial summary executions, and signs of mutilation (examinations of some of these bodies by doctors have revealed that some of the mutilations were inflicted while the detainees were still alive,The \\"Dirty War\\" In Chechnya, Human Rights Watch, March 2001 indicating that the victims were also severely tortured). On March 29, 2001, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR), Mary Robinson, called for a thorough investigation of the mass grave sites in Chechnya.

Club career Huberts began his career in his hometown with ASK Voitsberg. From there he was transferred to Grazer AK, who got him to the Stadion an der K√∂r√∂sistra√üe in 1955. Through his immense technical skills and his scoring qualities he became a supporter's favourite in Graz. When GAK played a couple of friendlies in New York in 1959, two of them against Real Madrid, it had causes for Huberts. The midfielder could convince at this tour, and so finally New York Hungarians of the German American Soccer League signed him in 1960. With this club he won National Challenge Cup (today Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup) in 1962. In 1963 he went to Frankfurt in Germany. In this year the Bundesliga was founded and the Eagles from Hesse were a founding member. Huberts was one of only four foreign players in German pro football, and the only Austrian. In the 1960s team of Frankfurt he was a key player. With the jersey number 10 he scored 80 times for the boys from Main. For the 1970‚Äì71 season he returned to Austria and joined Austria Wien and eventually his home club Grazer AK in 1971 and retired in 1975.

With the club change to New York came travel limitations, he was no longer selected for Austria and even when he joined Eintracht Frankfurt he never played again for the national team due to the politics of the clubs not to release foreign players except for big tournaments.

The New York Times, on 13 May 1941, reported that the death of Catherine Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç occurred on 11 May.Farrant, Leda. (2000). The Princess from St. Petersburg: The Life and Times of Princess Catherine Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. was a Polish-Russian aristocrat. Born in Russia into the Polish-Lithuanian House of Rzewuski, her maternal family was the Russian Dashkov-Vorontsov family. In 1873 she married the Polish-Lithuanian Prince Wilhelm Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. She was a prominent figure at the Imperial courts in Germany and Russia, but became involved in a series of scandals. She combined her love for the luxury of the courts, social life, gossip and intrigue with her literary talent and she wrote two dozen books on European royalty and the Russian court, including Behind the Veil at the Russian Court (1914) and her autobiography It Really Happened (1932).  Family and early life  Princess Catherine Radziwill was born in St. Petersburg as Countess Ekaterina Adamovna Rzewuska, a member of the House of Rzewuski, a Polish family of warriors, statesmen, adventurers and eccentrics. She was the only child of the Russian General Adam Adamowicz Rzewuski (1845‚Äî1911), who took part in the Crimean war, and his second wife Anna Dmitrievna Dashkova, a daughter of the writer Dmitry Vasilyevich Dashkov, Tsar Nicholas I's minister of justice. Catherine's mother, who belonged to some of Russia's most notable families: Dashkov, Stroganov, Pashkov and Vasilchikov, died while giving birth to her. Catherine's father married for a third time and provided her with three half- brothers, including Stanislaw Rzewuski, who became a novelist and literary critic. The Rzewuski was a family of notable writers, including Catherine's great-great-grandfather Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski, her uncle Henryk and her aunts Ewelina, wife of Honor√© de Balzac, and Karolina, who kept a literary salon in Paris. Catherine was educated under the supervision of her stern father in his large estates in central Ukraine. Although the Rzewuski family originated in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Catherine had no attachment to Poland and considered herself Russian. On 26 October 1873, at age 15, she married Prince Wilhelm Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1845-1911), a Polish officer in the Prussian army. The couple moved to Berlin to live with his family. She had seven children, four sons and three daughters. Two of her sons died in early childhood, but the other five children (Louise, Wanda, Gabriela, Nicholas and Casimir) reached adulthood. Little is known about Radziwill's marriage except what she wrote in her memoirs: Her husband treated her kindly, but she felt bored and frustrated. The couple became prominent at the court in Berlin.  Literary career  Princess Catherine Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç with a red ribbon around her neck, by Giovanni Boldini In 1884, Nouvelle Revue published a series of articles written as letters to a young diplomat by the elderly Count Paul Vasili. The articles were critical of Berlin society and full of damaging gossip about the imperial court. The publication of the articles, collected in the book Berlin Society, created a great scandal at the court. Count Paul Vasili was a fictional character and a subsequent investigation indicated Auguste G√©rard, the empress' French reader, as the author. Only in 1918 in her book Confessions of the Czarina, Radziwill admitted that she was the author of Berlin Society. The confusion was aggravated as other anonymous writers also began to use the pen-name Count Paul Vasili. After the publication of Berlin Society, Radziwill began to be seen with suspicion in Berlin and she traveled extensively with her husband. When her father died in Russia in April 1888, Radziwill decided to stay in St. Petersburg where her youngest son, Casimir, was born the same year. At the Russian court, Princess Radziwill had a prominent position. She became a friend and admirer of Konstantin Pobedonostsev. Her political leanings, very liberal while in Berlin, turned to staunchly conservative in Russia. She also began an affair with General Peter Alexander Cherevin, court commandant, head of the Third section of the Okhrana, and one of Tsar Alexander III's few trusted friends. During the late 1880s and early 1890s, Princess Radziwill reached the pinnacle of her life and of her influence at the court. Her situation suffered a sharp down turn with the deaths of Tsar Alexander III in 1894 and of her lover Cherevin in early 1896. Estranged from her husband and children, she earned some money writing articles for American magazines and newspapers chronicling British society, but she accumulated debts. In the summer of 1899, Radziwill left for South Africa setting her eyes on South African-based British magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes. They initially became friends, but Rhodes, who some writers and academics have suggested was homosexual, pulled away from her. Nevertheless, he paid her debts and sent her back to London; there Radziwill published the book The Resurrection of Peter, defending Rhodes. A scandal in London involving debts accumulated by her son Nicholas (that she tried to pay by claiming a stolen pearl necklace on a London Hotel) sent her back to Cape Town in the summer 1900. However, that did not keep Radziwill from again becoming a news item: > Princess Radziwill who was charged with having forged bills for large > amounts up to ¬£6000- on Mr. Rhodes was arrested on the 24.Sept.1901 for > fraud but released on bail the same day until she was charged in the Supreme > Court of the Cape Colony, Oct.1901 and sentenced to two years' imprisonment > after three days of trial. In her own evidence she stated that she had > received the bills signed in blank by Mr. Rhodes from Mrs. Scholtz but there > appear[sic] to be no doubt that she forged the bills and then attempted to > prevent action being taken by threats of publishing correspondence which she > alleged was of a compromising nature from Mr Rhodes and Lord Milner. Her > methods were, as the Attorney-General described them, the ordinary armoury > of the blackmailer: and she had made use of her social position for purposes > of intrigue and fraud. She was a fine specimen of the lady adventurer of > detective fiction and we may expect her reappearance in a roman √† clef > dealing with South Africa. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç spent the two years in jail where she occupied herself in writing. She was fortunate to end up spending only 16 months in prison for her crimes, being released in March of 1903. It is not known what happened to little Alexi during her stay in prison.Roberts, Brian. (1969). Cecil Rhodes and the princess. Hamilton. .Anthony, Thomas. (November 1997). Rhodes: The Race for Africa. London Bridge. . Some months later, her memoir, My Recollections (1904) was published in London and New York with some level of success. Her youngest son, Casimir, however, had died while she was in prison and her estranged husband finally divorced her in 1906. In 1909, she married Karl Emile Kolb-Danvin, a Swedish engineer and entrepreneur. The couple settled in St. Peterburg, where her son Nicholas was serving in the Russian army. She published two more books, Behind the Veil of the Russian court, under her pen- name Paul Vasili, and Memoirs of Forty Years (1914), a second autobiographical book. During World War I, her son was killed in the Eastern front in November 1914. Radziwill and her husband moved to Stockholm, where she was living at the outbreak of the Russian revolution. In a four-year span, she published a dozen books. She was on a visit to the United States when her second husband died, and she decided to stay in America. She settled in New York City where she spent the rest of her life. Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç played a major role in exposing The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. In 1921, she gave a private lecture in New York in which she claimed that the Protocols were compiled in 1904-1905 by Russian journalists Matvei Golovinski and Manasevich-Manuilov at the direction of Pyotr Rachkovsky, chief of the Okhrana, the Russian secret service in Paris. cf. Full article Golovinski worked together with Charles Joly (son of Maurice Joly) at Le Figaro in Paris. This account, however, contradicts the basic chronology of the Protocols publication as they already had been published in 1903 in the Znamya newspaper. Moreover, in 1902, Rachkovsky was dismissed from the Paris Okhrana and returned to St. Petersburg. Radziwill's statements were cited during the Berne Trial by Russian witnesses in 1934 and by experts in 1935; they gave evidence that her date of 1905, when Matvei Golovinski would have shown her a manuscript of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (\\"with a big blue ink spot on the first page\\") in Paris, is obviously an error of chronology, possibly caused by a typo in her article published in The American Hebrew and reprinted by The New York Times.\\"Protocols Forged in Paris\\" Says Princess Radziwill In an Exclusive Interview With Isaac Landeman, published in The American Hebrew, February 25, 1921, Volume 108 Number 15, page 422.

Formerly produced in partnership with Creation Entertainment, the Weekend of Horrors show is now owned exclusively by Fangoria Magazine and is held once annually in Los Angeles, California. The convention also deals in areas of the horror genre outside filmmaking, as well as exploitation, science fiction, and fantasy entertainment. Fangoria magazine editor Tony Timpone was the Master of Ceremonies and Co-Producer of the shows during its time with Creation Entertainment.  Convention layout  Weekend of Horrors conventions are typically composed of three areas: * The Dealers' Area, which is made up primarily of vendors selling horror-themed merchandise and booths advertising films, * The Auditorium, where panels and speeches are given for the duration of the convention, * And The Screening Room, where new independent and mainstream horror films are screened via digital projection. Some conventions also have Film Fests (occurring at neighboring theaters) and a Cocktail, or more recently, Dessert Party, where guests can casually mingle with horror personalities after-hours.  Locations and dates  The Weekend of Horrors began in 1985, with its name and likeness owned by Creation Entertainment. Starting with the 2006 Weekend of Horrors in Secaucus, New Jersey, the convention expanded from a two-day (Saturday and Sunday) event, to a three-day (including Friday). This expanded schedule, common for most current conventions, was continued for all future Weekend of Horrors. Until 2008, Weekend of Horrors occurred annually in Rosemont, Illinois (Winter), Los Angeles, California (Spring), and New York City, New York (formerly Secaucus, New Jersey) (Summer), with an additional destination chosen based on the year (in 2008, Austin, Texas, was added to the circuit).

Early life and education Ernest Earl Lockhart was born in Boston, Massachusetts (USA) on September 10, 1912. He grew up in the Hyde Park section of Boston; Lockhart was the youngest of three children of Clinton Daniel Lockhart and Celeste Althea Westhaver, who both emigrated from Nova Scotia, Canada. E.E. Lockhart was educated in the Boston public schools, at the Chauncy Hall School, and then at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned three degrees, culminating with a PhD in biochemistry in 1938. Career and achievements Following a year of study on fellowship at the Biochemical Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, E.E. Lockhart served as the physiologist on Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd‚Äôs United States Antarctic Service Expedition of 1939-1941 to the South Pole. For this service he received a special medal authorized by the Congress of the United States. A memorable experience on the expedition was a four-month, 400-mile field trip by dog team. He was the radio operator for his four-man party. Mount Lockhart, a mountain in the Fosdick range, is named after him. Upon his return home, E.E. Lockhart began a career of research and teaching at M.I.T. in the field of food technology and nutrition. In 1955 he left M.I.T. to become research director at the Coffee Brewing Institute, a trade organization located in New York City. In 1965, he became assistant research director of the Coca Cola Company in Atlanta, Georgia, Georgia, where he lived until his retirement in 1978.

Football career Watson started his career as a trainee with his local side Tottenham Hotspur. Watson scored his only Spurs goal on his debut in a League Cup tie against Brentford. As a youngster his first-team opportunities were limited and he went out on loan to several sides to build his experience, namely Brentford, Bristol City and Barnet. In 1996, he was signed by Swindon Town manager Steve McMahon. Newly promoted to second tier of the English Football League ‚Äì Watson helped them avoid relegation. Watson moved on to Rotherham United in July 1999, astute Millers' manager Ronnie Moore signing him on a free transfer. In his first season Watson helped Rotherham to promotion from League Two, narrowly missing out on the title. Another promotion (and another title near miss) followed in the next season and Rotherham were promoted again into the Football League Championship. A key part of their rapid acceleration, Watson helped guide the team to survival by the narrowest of goal-difference margins. After over 100 games at Rotherham his knack for promotions was spotted by then Reading manager Alan Pardew who at first, took Watson on loan before signing him permanently in March 2002 for ¬£150,000 ‚Äì where he promptly repeated the trick, guiding the Royals to promotion from League One, in his now customary second place. His first full season at Reading saw the Royals into a play-off place, where narrow defeat to Wolves cost them a place in the Premiership. Perhaps tellingly Watson was on the bench for those key play-off games. When former teammate Phil Parkinson was installed as manager at Colchester United one of his first acts was to bring Watson to Layer Road. Marshalling the midfield Watson played a key role as in his (and Parkinson's) first full season the U's stormed to promotion from League One, finishing in second place. Now with over 100 games for the U's under his belt he has been a key part of \\"The Best Col U ever\\" as the underdog U's finished their first season in the Football League Championship in 10th place. He was released by Colchester at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, and then signed on a free transfer for Luton Town. However, Watson failed to make an impact at Luton as a result of a knee injury that kept him out of action for much of his contract duration, and he was released at the end of 2008. In 2015 whilst assistant manager of Stevenage, Watson alongside Stevenage manager Teddy Sheringham registered as players. Coaching career After his release from a playing contract at Luton, Watson was given the position of first-team coach by Luton manager Mick Harford on 14 January 2009. After Harford's departure on 1 October 2009, Watson continued in his coaching capacity under new boss Richard Money until May 2010, when he left the club. Following the departure of Aidy Boothroyd from Colchester United to take the manager's job at Coventry City on 20 May 2010, Watson expressed an interest in taking up the vacant managerial position at his former club. In May 2015 he was appointed manager of Maldon & TiptreeFormer Colchester United and Spurs man Kevin Watson is new Maldon & Tiptree boss Essex Chronicle, 19 May 2015 However, Watson left the club after only eleven days to take up the position of assistant manager to Teddy Sheringham at Stevenage. He left his position in February after Teddy Sheringham's departure. From July 2015 to November 2015, he worked at the academy of Colchester United. In August 2016, Watson was appointed Assistant Manager at Eastleigh.

It is part of Elaphiti Islands archipelago, Dalmatia and is situated from Dubrovnik, from Koloƒçep, from Lopud and from ≈†ipan. Sveti Andrija on morsko-prase.hr The island is long, and its maximal width is , length of shore is . Total area of the island is , and height is . The shores of the island are rocky and inhospitable. The western part of the island is covered with pine forest and various Mediterranean growth. Vegetation on the rest of the island is low lying, mainly bushes. Owing to numerous birds, the island was declared an ornithological reserve. History The patrician family Crijeviƒá from Dubrovnik built Benedictine monastery on the island in the 15th century. The monastery was remote and isolated and during time it was used for various purposes. For some time, it was used as quarantine for inhabitants of island of Lopud. The monastery was destroyed during the 1667 Dubrovnik earthquake. Lighthouse During 1873 a lighthouse was built on the island, financed by the Austro-Hungarian government. A two-storey house was built, with a masonry tower in the centre. The building has area of , and a lantern room with a gallery is fitted at the top of the tower. The optic is a clamshell Fresnel lens. At a height of above sea level, the light is visible from a distance of , making it one of strongest lights in Adriatic Sea.  Famous people on Sveti Andrija  In the 16th century, Mavro Vetranoviƒá ƒåavƒçiƒá, a famous poet from Dubrovnik lived on the island as a monk. About this time on the island he wrote in his poem \\"Remeta\\". Ludovik Crijeviƒá Tuberon, a historian from Dubrovnik lived there at the end of 15th century.  Legend connected with Sveti Andrija  A young girl, Mare, lived with three brothers on island of Lopud. Her friend Cvijeta had a brother Niko who was very interested in Mare. The brothers were fishing one night and from the stormy sea they rescued a shipwreck victim, the young patrician \\"Ivan\\". He was from an influential noble family from Dubrovnik. He was sick and Mare nursed him. They fell in love, but their love was forbidden because they came from different classes. Ivan tried his best to obtain permission from his father but without any success. Disappointed, he quit ordinary life and become a monk on the island of Sveti Andrija. Mare learned about that and went to island to see her beloved. She repeated her visits more and more often, sometimes swimming from Lopud. At the end of the summer days Sveti Andrija was not clearly visible from Lopud any more. To solve this situation of declining visibility, Ivan had the duty to light a lantern on the rock and wait for Mare, while she swam towards the signal. Niko and her brothers found out and together they decided to get revenge. One evening Mare was swimming towards Sv. Andrija and Niko and her brothers were following her. When night came they lit a lantern in their boat and started rowing towards open sea. Mare was following the light further and further away. Ivan was waiting that night and then the next night and then the next. The third night the sea threw her body on the rocks. After that Ivan remained all his life in the monastery.Document Archived in Dubrovnik-1483  See also  *List of lighthouses in Croatia References Sources * Category:Islets of Croatia Category:Lighthouses completed in 1873 Category:Lighthouses in Croatia Category:Islands of the Adriatic Sea Category:Elaphiti Islands ","title":"Sveti Andrija (Dubrovnik)"},{"id":"7210583","text":"Sveti Andrija (, meaning \\"Saint Andrew\\"), often called Svetac (, meaning \\"saint\\"), is an island in the Croatian part of the Adriatic Sea.

Svetac was inhabited in prehistoric era, as evidenced by archeological remains, the oldest of which were found in Tovorski bod, a cave in the south part of the island. A Benedictine monastery built on the island was abandoned in late 15th or early 16th century. In 1760, a small pine tar factory was opened. After the pine forest on the island was completely cut down, the factory was closed, and Svetac was acquired by members of Zanki family, who settled there. The population census on Svetac from 1951 was around 60, all members of Zanki family. The last one of the group who lived there all year round was Antonija Zanki, an elderly woman who died in 2001. Now members of Zanki family effectively live there four to six months a year, from late spring to autumn, still keeping up the houses of their grandfathers, fishing, making famous red wine and olive oil. Most of members of Zanki family who own this, biggest private island in Adriatic, live in Komi≈æa now (14 nm east). Taking the fact that island is in open seas, without any natural protected bay, gives even greater respect to members of this family who managed to survive there for centuries, and furthermore created a special kind of living, especially today.A tip about the island on dalmatia.hr Approximately 300 meters off the south-west coast of the island there is the islet of Kamik, and farther on the open sea there is the volcanic island called Jabuka.

He discovered bleaching powder and founded an industrial dynasty. Biography Born at Laigh Corton, Alloway, Ayrshire to John Tennant (1725‚Äì1810) and his second wife, Margaret McClure (1738‚Äì1784). The family had worked the land for generations and were friends with local poet Robert Burns (1759‚Äì1796). In Burns' epistle to \\"James Tennant of Glenconner\\" Tennant is mentioned as \\"wabster Charlie\\" (Scots language: weaver). This referring to the occupation on which Tennant had embarked, namely silk weaving, being apprenticed at the village of Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire. Charles was the ninth of John Tennant's sixteen children. As a baby, he moved from Laigh corton farm to Glenconner, Ochiltree, Ayrshire He was fortunate to receive schooling both at home and at the Ochiltree parish school. He was apprenticed by his father to a master handloom weaver. This was a highly paid occupation, requiring great skill and considerable intelligence. Weavers were to be envied at the end of the eighteenth century for weaving had developed into Scotland's first industry, the counterpart of the woolen industry in England. Most farmers grew flax for their wives to spin and this, along with imported cotton, provided the material for many newly established cotton mills.  Impetus  Tennant was quick to learn his trade, but also to see that the growth of the weaving industry was restricted by the primitive methods used to bleach the cloth. At that time this involved treatment with stale urine and leaving the cloth exposed to sunlight for many months in so called bleachfield. Huge quantities of unbleached cotton piled up in the warehouses. Tennant left his well paid weaving position to try to develop improved bleaching methods. Charles Tennant's Darnley Bleach Fields c. 1800 He acquired bleaching fields in 1788, at Darnley, near Barrhead, Renfrewshire, and turned his mind and energy to developing ways to shorten the time required in bleaching. Others had already managed to reduce bleaching time from eighteen months to four by replacing sour milk with sulfuric acid. Further, in the last half of the eighteenth century, bleachers started to use lime in the bleaching process, but only in secret due to possible injurious effects. Tennant had the original idea that a combination of chlorine and lime would produce the best bleaching results. He worked on this idea for several years and was finally successful. His method proved to be effective, inexpensive and harmless. He was granted patent #2209 on 23 January 1798. He continued his research and developed a bleaching powder for which he was granted patent #2312 on 30 April 1799. While still working in the bleachfields around the year 1794, Tennant formed a partnership with four friends. The first of these, Dr. William Couper, was the legal advisor to the partnership. The second partner was Alexander Dunlop (His brother married Charles' eldest daughter), who served as accountant to the group. The third partner, James Knox, managed the sales department. Charles Macintosh, an excellent chemist, was the fourth partner. He is known for his technique of macintosh waterproofing and he also assisted in the invention of bleaching powder. Immediately after granting of the patent on bleaching, Charles and his partners purchased land on the Monkland Canal, just north of Glasgow, to build a factory for the production of bleaching liquor and powder. The area was known as St. Rollox, after a French holy man. It was close to a good supply of lime, and since the area was rural, the land was cheap. Additionally, the nearby canal provided excellent transportation. Production was swiftly moved from the earlier bleachfields in Darnley, to the new plant in St. Rollox. It quickly became successful. Production increased from fifty-two tons the first year, 1799, to over 9200 tons the fifth year. Later a second plant was built at Hebburn, raising production of bleaching powder alone to 20 000 tons by 1865. In 1798 James Knox and Robert Tennant (Charles younger brother), went to Ireland where they struck a deal with the Irish bleachers, for the use of the process. Although the Irish bleachers admitted a saving of over GB¬£160,000 in 1799 alone, by using the Tennant process, they never paid for its use as agreed. As a result, the partnership lost a great deal in time and money. Further losses came from challenges to the patents in England and Ireland and the outright infringement of the process. In spite of these worrisome problems the partnership was a great success. It continued for fourteen years when the rights under the patents expired. Charles continued to expand his horizons during this time. When the partnership ended he purchased the company. As a forward thinking business man, he was in a class by himself. His company, during the 1830s and 1840s was the largest chemical plant in the world. As a dedicated reformer Charles played his full part in the movements of the day. A great deal of unrest followed the Napoleonic wars, which had the effect of increased wealth for the manufacturing classes but poverty for the working classes. Charles and his son John were active in a time liberal views could be construed as treason. He worked for many years in the reform movement, but it was not until he reached the age of sixty-four that his effort bore fruit with the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832. Following on from the success of the reform Bill of 1832 Charles appears to have been a leading light in the movement to honour Scotland's Political Martyr Thomas Muir of Huntershill, A public dinner was organised to take place on 17 January 1838, Charles was to chair the event at Mosesfield house, the home of James Duncan Esq. Unfortunately Charles was indisposed and unable to attend. His ideas and active support helped create one of the most productive periods of social progress and reform, in almost every area, in Scotland's history. Charles Tennant, in spite of the many demands on his time from outside sources, never lost sight of the main business in his life, the St. Rollox chemical works. By the year 1832, St. Rollox was consuming thirty thousand tons of coal a year. The system had not been designed to handle this volume. It just could not do so efficiently. He plunged into a study of possible solutions to the problem. His imagination and interest were fired by a new way of transporting people and freight. This involved using wagons, pulled by a steam engine, on iron rails laid on a level roadbed. He had heard of this from his good friend George Stephenson, the great railway engineer. He quickly realised this was the answer to his problem at St. Rollox. From 1825 until his death he was one of the prime movers in railway expansion. He was mainly responsible for getting a railway into Glasgow, over the fierce opposition of the canal proprietors. Never one to overlook a sideline, Charles decided he must not forget the waterways. In 1830 he started his younger sister Sarah's son, William Sloan, with some small schooners. He saw this as a way to control the transportation of chemical products to nearby markets. At the time of Sloan's death in 1848 they had the largest fleet in Glasgow, and were running nineteen vessels. Charles lived to see his empire grow to be the largest and most important in the world. He was, beyond question, an entrepreneur of amazing ability. His dedication to his work, his family and his sense of what was right and fair lasted until the day he died. He was quick to champion those less fortunate, and the reforms he initiated and supported made the lives of his countrymen better. On his death on 1 October 1838, his eldest son John Tennant became managing director of Charles Tennant & Co for the next 40 years. Amongst other diverse business interests, he also became a partner in the Bonnington Chemical Works.  Discovery  With the chemist Charles Macintosh (1766‚Äì1843) he helped establish Scotland's first alum works at Hurlet, Renfrewshire. In 1798 he took out a patent for a bleach liquor formed by passing chlorine into a mixture of lime and water. This product had the advantage of being cheaper than the one generally used at the time because it substituted lime for potash. Unfortunately when Tennant attempted to protect his rights against infringement, his patent was held invalid on the double ground that the specification was incomplete and that the invention had been anticipated at a bleach works near Nottingham. Tennant's great discovery was bleaching powder (chloride of lime) for which he took a patent in 1799. The process involved reacting chlorine and dry slaked lime to form bleaching powder, a mixture of calcium hypochlorite and other derivatives. It seems Macintosh also played a significant role in this discovery and remained one of Tennant's associates for many years.  Fortune  Charles Tennant's St. Rollox Chemical Works in 1831 In 1800 Tennant founded a chemical works at St. Rollox, Glasgow. The principal product being bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite), which was sold worldwide. By 1815 the business was known as Charles Tennant & Co. and had expanded into other chemicals, metallurgy and explosives. The early rail network in Scotland and important mines in Spain were also areas of interest. The St. Rollox plant grew to be the largest chemical works in the world during the 1830s and 1840s. It covers over and had of floor space. It had a payroll of over one thousand persons and dominated the local economy. The huge chimney known as the St. Rollox Stalk aka Tennant's Stalk towered over everything. It was a well-known landmark around Glasgow. Built in 1842, it rose a majestic in the air. It was in diameter at ground level. In 1922 it was struck by lightning and had to be dynamited down, but until that time it was in daily use.  Legacy  Tennant died at his home at Abercromby PlaceGlasgow Post Office Directory 1838 in Glasgow on 1 October 1838. He is buried in Glasgow Necropolis where his monument stands on the upper plateau. The unusual statue thereon is in the form of a very casually (arguably slumped) seated figure. The sculpture is by Patrick Park (1811‚Äì1855) and appears to be base on Francis Chantrey's statue of James Watt in the nearby Hunterian Museum. The mighty business empire Tennant founded and the immense wealth generated allowed many of his descendants to marry into the aristocracy, his grandson Charles Clow Tennant (1823‚Äì1906) becoming 1st baronet. The chemical business founded by Tennant became known as the United Alkali Company Ltd. and eventually merged with others in 1926 to form the chemical giant Imperial Chemical Industries. The chemical works at Springburn closed in 1964. The company still exists and has headquarters in Bath Street and a factory in Maryhill.

In that year, the Church of Scotland united the two Govan congregations with Linthouse and established the parish church at Govan Cross, making Govan Old redundant. Govan Old Church is no longer used for regular Sunday services, but the building remains a place of worship with a daily morning service and is open to visitors in the afternoons. The church dedicated to Saint Constantine of Strathclyde occupies a Scottish Gothic Revival building of national significance (A-Listed by Historic Environment Scotland) within a churchyard designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Historic Environment Scotland). The church houses an internationally significant collection of early medieval sculpture known as Govan Stones. All the carved stones come from the churchyard and include interlace-decorated crosses, hogbacks, and burial monuments dating to the 9th - 11th centuries AD. Govan Old and the Govan Stones are open daily between April 1 and October 31 from 1pm-4pm. Admission to the museum is by donation. Creation of the site It is believed that the site's earliest Christian activity began sometime in the 6th century AD. Archaeological excavations in the 1990s uncovered two early Christian burials beneath the foundations of a later church; these burials were radiocarbon-dated between the 5th and 6th centuries AD (AD 435-601 and AD 474 -601). Despite this early activity, it wasn't until the 9th and 10th centuries that Govan Old rose to prominence. There are few historical references to Govan in the interim, though there appears to be one reference included in Simeon of Durham's ‚ÄòHistoria Regum Anglorum‚Äô, compiled sometime in the 12th century AD. In it, Simeon records the return of the Northumbrian army from Ovania after attacking Dumbarton in 756 AD. The ceiling of Old Govan Parish Church The north window, Old Govan Parish Church Originally, the Annals of Ulster recorded Dumbarton Rock as the centre of the British Kingdom of Al Clud (usually pre-emptively referred to as the Kingdom of Strathclyde, but which is more accurately described as ‚Äòthe kingdom on the Clyde‚Äô) from the 6th century AD until the later 9th century AD. In the year 870 AD, the annals record a Viking raid on Dumbarton Rock; after this point, the kings of Clyde Rock are no longer discussed. In 872 AD, the Annals of Ulster instead refer to the kingdom of Ystrad Clud, better known as the kingdom of Strathclyde, which appears to mark the shift of political power from Dumbarton Rock further upstream to Govan. It is possible that a predecessor of the 12th century royal estate at Partick and the now-destroyed Doomster Hill (which is thought to have functioned as a moot hill or meeting place) played a part in this power shift. The size of the graveyard and the sheer amount of early medieval sculpture suggest that the church was supported by royal patronage. Because the site has been in continual use since it was first established, it is impossible to tell what the original church looked like, but it is clear that it always had Christian associations. Building Upright cross-slabs and Jordanhill cross at Govan Old Govan Old Parish Church is an ornate, Category A listed building of significant architectural merit, designed by Robert Rowand Anderson and influenced by features at Pluscarden Abbey near Elgin. Govan has, however, known considerable socio-economic problems and has been severely affected by the decline in the shipbuilding industry. The current church building was constructed in 1888, although the site is one of the oldest places of Christian worship in Scotland. Unusually, the axis of the church was turned to orientate north-south rather than the traditional east-west orientation, but this allowed the main door to face south to the main street. Upon construction, the congregation was closely associated with the Scoto-Catholic High Church movement within the Church of Scotland‚Äîseveral former ministers have been actively involved with the Scottish Church Society. Notable former ministers include the Reverend George MacLeod, later the Lord MacLeod of Fuinary, and Norman Shanks, Leader of the Iona Community from 1995 to 2002. Govan Old also has noteworthy stained glass windows. Two of the church's windows were given by Robert Malcolm Kerr; the Emmaus window in 1891, and Christ blessing the children in 1902. Both were made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne.Kerr on the Govan Old Church website The church's collection of early Christian carved stones is of international significance. This was first properly recognised in December 1855 when the digging of a grave led to the rediscovery of the sarcophagus. The exciting discovery prompted scholars to illustrate and record the sarcophagus and other early medieval monuments in the churchyard. A photographic record of forty-six carved stones was commissioned and published by John Stirling Maxwell. For this publication, Robert Foster of Stirling made plaster casts of each of the stones; these casts were then taken to the studio of renowned photographers T & R Annan & Son and photographed in ideal lighting conditions to emphasise the carving. These photographs were used in the J. Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's Early Christian Monuments of Scotland, though only thirty-nine were included in their volume; however, of these thirty-nine, one stone was not recorded by Stirling Maxwell, which puts the number of probable early medieval stones from Govan at forty-seven. Jumping forward to the 1960s, Ralegh Radford saw the stones as a means to understand Govan's early significance and made close comparisons between the carved stones from Govan and those found at Inchinnan, which, along with other monuments in the region, are described as belonging to a ‚ÄòGovan School‚Äô of carving. Today, thirty monuments are currently on display inside the church, and a single recumbent monument of medieval date remains in the graveyard. Sixteen of the stones that were not brought into the church were thought to have been buried or removed after the demolition of the Harland & Wolff factory building in 1973, but a recent community archaeology dig identified the location of at least three of the lost stones. Work in the near future will assess how many of the ‚Äòlost‚Äô stones survive. Of the thirty-one monuments on display at Govan Old, there is one sarcophagus, two cross-shafts, two upright cross-slabs, five hogbacks, and twenty-one recumbent cross-slabs. Hogbacks at Govan Old Parish church Govan sarcophagus The Govan sarcophagus is a stone coffin with a carved exterior; it was rediscovered when the sexton was digging a grave in the south-east corner of the churchyard in December 1855, surrounded by roots from two elm trees. No human remains were found with the sarcophagus, so it is thought that it was buried at an earlier date to protect the monument, perhaps during the Scottish Reformation when iconoclasm was common practice. Today, the sarcophagus is on display in the modern Govan Old Parish Church Museum. The sarcophagus is supposed to have been dedicated to the patron saint of the church, St Constantine. There is much debate over which Constantine is the patron, and whether it is Constantine of Strathclyde, but most scholars agree that the coffin most likely would have been dedicated to Constantine f. Kenneth (AD 862-878) or Donald f. Constantine (AD 889-900).Because of its highly decorated exterior, it is assumed that the coffin was meant to display the remains of the saint as a focal piece in the church. Govan, carved sarcophagus with Old Parish Church, generally linked with saint Constantine The coffin itself depicts Insular iconography, taking inspiration from different styles that were then popular in the Irish sea region. One face of the sarcophagus shows a hunting scene of a horseman chasing a stag, perhaps accompanied by a dog, a motif frequently used in Pictish art that is thought to convey an association with royalty and power. The sarcophagus also shows an animal trampling another; the angular decoration of the triumphant animal has led many scholars to suggest that this is a ‚ÄòLamb of God‚Äô motif. Two panels depicting beasts in various configurations are found on the other long face of the sarcophagus: in one, four ‚Äòbeasts‚Äô are pseudo-mirrored across the vertical and horizontal axes of the panel, though there are differences in each beast's design. In the second panel, two long-necked animals cross necks and interlace their tongue/ears with the other beast's tail; similar motifs, where beasts cross legs, necks, or other body parts, can also be found in Pictish sculpture. The rest of the space on the sarcophagus is filled with panels of median-incised interlace, some of which represent snakes, which a relatively common motif in Insular sculpture, thought to be a symbol of death and resurrection. Crosses and Upright Cross-slabs Two cross-shafts and two upright cross-slabs are on display in the Govan Old museum. The two cross- shafts include the iconic Jordanhill cross and the ‚ÄòInverted (or Upside Down) Cross‚Äô. These would have been decorated on all four faces and, when whole, would have been part of a free-standing cross, probably in a form similar to the more intact Barochan Cross, now housed at Paisley Museum. The Jordanhill cross is so named because it was gifted to the residents of Jordanhill House at some point when one of the churches was being replaced, though there are conflicting accounts as to when this took place. It was brought back to Govan Old in 1928. The cross is decorated with different variants of median-incised interlace, though its most notable feature is an eroded man on horseback that has lost much of its detail apart from the eyes of both horse and man. The ‚ÄòInverted‚Äô or ‚ÄòUpside Down‚Äô cross is so named because it is currently displayed upside down. Though most of the details on the broad faces of the cross have been damaged or eroded, the two smaller faces are comparatively well-preserved. These are mostly decorated with median-incised interlace, though this also retains the only figural sculpture that can be interpreted as a biblical scene ‚Äì possibly David being anointed by Samuel. The two upright cross-slabs include the ‚ÄòSun Stone‚Äô and the ‚ÄòCuddy Stane‚Äô. The ‚ÄòSun Stone‚Äô is heavily eroded, but it is decorated with a large boss from which emerge four snakes, arranged in such a way that it appears ‚Äòsun-like‚Äô, above an angular interlace panel. On the other broad face it is decorated with a cross, median- incised interlace, and a rider on one face. Though there is a tenon on top of the stone slab, scholars have argued this would not have supported a cross -head and could indicate that the Sun Stone played an architectural function. The ‚ÄòCuddy Stane‚Äô has gotten its name from its rider's steed, which appears more like a donkey than a horse. The stone has been damaged since it was illustrated in 1856, which records the rider's upper half and the shape of the cross-head. While the stone appears plain today, this is likely because it has been severely eroded; hints of a panel of interlace are preserved under the horseman. Hogbacks Hogbacks are recumbent stone monuments found across Scotland and Northern England that date to the 10th ‚Äì 11th centuries AD; the term ‚Äòhogback‚Äô was established prior to 1885 to describe the characteristic curved ridge of the monument. Hogbacks are often decorated with rows of tegulation on the broad faces and each end often sports stylised or naturalistic beasts, though there is substantial variation on these traits from monument to monument. The tegulation has led many to argue that hogbacks are meant to emulate a house-shape, specifically Scandinavian long houses. Five hogbacks are housed at Govan Old, the largest collection of hogbacks in Scotland; four of these are the largest known hogbacks in all of Great Britain. The smallest of the hogbacks (SM 2, ECMS 2, Lang 1) is the best preserved and exhibits the most decoration; it has been suggested that this style has similarities to sculpture in Cumbria . Two of the hogbacks have each been recut to resemble a single beast, though it is unclear when this took place. Three of the hogbacks have concave tegulation, while the other two exhibit straight-sided ‚Äòshingles‚Äô. Recumbent cross-slabs The recumbent cross-slabs take up the largest proportion of the collection at Govan Old; twenty-one of the originally recorded thirty-seven are on display. Unfortunately these monuments have received the least amount of attention because they have been differentially worn and liberally reused since at least the 17th century. While the cross-slabs vary in size, in shape and in the decorative motifs used, there are some features they share. They each exhibit a cross with an incised border, which consistently divides the stone into at least two panels. For each stone there is a plain border that defines the edge of the monument. Finally, of the twenty-one recumbent cross-slabs on display, at least five show evidence for a regionally significant feature known as ‚Äòangle-knobs ‚Äô. These tombstones are of particular importance to any future tourism development and hold great potential. Amalgamation Following arbitration, the Church of Scotland's Presbytery of Glasgow decided upon a union of the three local Church of Scotland congregations in the Govan area. Govan Old (along with the charges of Linthouse St. Kenneth and New Govan) was terminated on 28 October 2007, becoming part of Govan and Linthouse parish and congregation. The future of the Govan Old Parish Church building remains uncertain as the united congregation continues to use all three original buildings, albeit with the former New Govan building being the main centre of worship. After 2007, the future of the Govan Old Parish Church was uncertain. In 2008, an Options Appraisal study was undertaken by Govan Workspace Ltd, who then took the lead in applying for funding to redisplay the sculpture. The funding was secured in 2011, allowing the redisplay to be completed by Northlight Heritage/York Archaeological Trust in 2013. Govan Old's future was secured when the Govan Heritage Trust obtained a grant from the Scottish Government in 2016. The Trust aims to develop the church into a self- sustaining community-run cultural, museum and business complex but requires further financial support from the community to bring to fruition. The former minister of the Govan and Linthouse Parish Church was Rev Dr Moyna McGlynn, who passed away in August 2016. The current interim minister of the Govan and Linthouse Parish Church is the Reverend Eleanor McMahon. The church is located near Govan Station on the Glasgow Subway.  Archaeology  In March 2019, ‚Ä≤Stones and Bones‚Ä≤ community archaeologists with a schoolboy named Mark McGettigan revealed long-lost medieval stone carvings. The stones were assumed to have been demolished by chance when a neighboring shipyard building was destroyed in the 1970s. ‚ÄúThis the most exciting discovery we have had at Govan in the last 20 years. The Govan Stones are a collection of international importance and these recovered stones reinforce the case for regarding Govan as a major early medieval centre of power\\", said Professor Stephen Driscoll.

The aim is to alleviate traffic congestion on the A57 road/A628 road/A616 road routes that presently pass through the villages. There is both support and opposition for this long-planned scheme which will pass through the valley of Longdendale and part of the Peak District National Park. After nearly fifty years, part of the road scheme ‚Äì the Mottram Bypass and Glossop Spur ‚Äì was approved by the Highways Agency on 2 December 2014. The A57 in Mottram would have been bypassed. The road would have run through Holybank Quarry, Tintwistle.  Background  The existing A628 trunk road connects the M67 from Manchester to the M1 in South Yorkshire. A single- carriageway road through the villages of Mottram in Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle and through the Peak District National Park, it is used by a relatively large number of heavy goods vehicles. Supporters of the scheme say that the A628 is one of the most congested A-road routes in the country, with high volumes of traffic (including HGVs) using a road which is totally unsuitable for the volume and nature of traffic it carries and that there is no viable alternative to a bypass. A survey in 2010 found that the junction of the A57 and M67 was the most congested in Manchester. Concern has been raised that the scheme would not have improved safety on the Woodhead Pass, where the majority of serious accidents occur.  Route  A map showing the proposed route The scheme envisaged a new dual carriageway that would have headed north-east from the eastern end of the M67, passed under the A6018 Roe Cross Road, Old Road and Old Hall Lane in a tunnel approximately north of the point where those roads converge. To the east of this area the route would have continued onto a roundabout which provides for a link road down to the A57 at Mottram Moor. To the east of the roundabout, the Preferred Route would have proceeded north-east through the Swallows Wood nature reserve, then curved south-east to join the existing A628 east of Tintwistle near Townhead Farm. Another proposed local authority road, the 'Glossop Spur', would have linked to the A57 at Woolley Bridge. The Department for Transport published both a map of the immediate area and another showing routes across the Peak District and the location of Flouch, which were scheduled to have associated traffic works. An independently produced overlay for Google maps is also available.The overlay for Google maps is available at .  History  Since 1971 residents of Tameside have been working and lobbying, with Local Politicians, for a better solution for the A57/A628 connection of Manchester and Sheffield to the M67 ‚Äì passing through villages of Mottram and Hollingworth, as well as affecting those around it. The plans were restored in the Conservative government's Roads for Prosperity white paper in 1989 following a public consultation process. A preferred route was selected in October 1993 but work was suspended in 1996 following further government reviews of the national road-building programme work. In December 2014 the scheme was approved. In July 1998 the incumbent Labour government published the results of its own review in the document 'A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England' and included the bypass as a scheme to be progressed through the preparatory stages. In November 2002, the Highways Agency submitted a report to the Regional Planning bodies (North West, East Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber). The scheme received support from the communities affected by the bypass in the form of a petition with 9,000 signatures that was delivered to Downing Street in February 2003. In this submission, they formed the conclusion that there were no realistic alternatives to a bypass of the villages to solve the problems that existed. In April 2003 the bypass entered the Targeted Programme of Improvements, recognising the likelihood of increased traffic along the route and including proposals to discourage road users from switching from other cross-Pennine routes. Under the Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) initiative the Highways Agency appointed Mowlem to take the scheme forward. The ECI allows for detailed planning work to be carried out while the scheme moves through statutory procedures. On 31 January 2006 the Secretary of State for Transport published formal proposals in the form of Draft Orders to construct the bypass, make good the older roads, and introduce 'route restraint measures'. The public and other interested organisations were allowed a period of 13 weeks until 5 May 2006 to express their opinions on the proposals. In May 2006 the Highways Agency released information under the Freedom of Information Act of all properties they had purchased in connection with the scheme during the previous 30 years, and an updated copy was also released in August 2008. By the end of the consultation period 1,400 people had written letters expressing their objection to the scheme, with a further 1,000 in favour. Stephen Ladyman, then Minister of State for Transport, stated that \\"life for people in Mottram, Tintwistle and Hollingworth should be greatly improved by this bypass. Getting traffic out of the villages will make them a safer and healthier place to live\\". Retrieved on 2 November 2008. Objections were also received from the Countryside Agency, English Nature, the Peak District National Park and the National Trust. The North West Regional Assembly had presented advice to Ministers in January 2006 and then in June 2006 provided a revised sequencing of priority schemes. On 6 July 2006 the Secretary of State for Transport responded to these revised sequences and confirmed that funding provision could be made for the Longdendale bypass beyond 2010/11. In December 2006 Rebecca Lush, a long-standing road protester and founder of Road Block, claimed the scheme was \\"particularly inappropriate and damaging\\". In January 2007 Stephen Ladyman stated that construction work was expected to start in spring 2013. The change to the proposed timing and costs required a review of the Environmental Statement, which was duly republished with associated Draft Orders on 8 February 2007. There followed a 6-week consultation period during which the Peak District authority responded. Having been estimated at ¬£90 million in 2003, Retrieved on 6 September 2008. the cost of the proposal was estimated to have risen to ¬£240‚Äì¬£315m in 2008. On 2 December 2014, the government announced that it will be investing ¬£170m on the A57, A628 and A628 trans-Pennine route, including a bypass for the village of Mottram. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has given the go- ahead for an initial scheme of at least ¬£170 million to resolve the traffic issue through Mottram and to build a link road to Glossop. The Government will also consult on whether to extend the proposed scheme to relieve pressure on Tintwistle as well. In addition to the works announced, there are also studies and proposals into the possibility of a tunnel under the Peak District to link Manchester with Sheffield, with some of the proposed tunnel routes using the existing M67 route to link the M60 and M1 motorways.  Public Inquiry  Details of the Public Inquiry were announced in April 2007. It was to be run by Persona Associates with John Watson as Inspector. An official public inquiry website was launched offering news, transcripts and documentation for download. The inquiry opened on 26 June 2007. On 16 July 2007 the inquiry was adjourned until 4 September with a final deadline for Proofs of Evidence of 14 August 2007. On 11 September 2007 the inquiry was again adjourned until 19 September to allow the Highways Agency to review traffic evidence, with further adjournments until 18 December. On 4 December 2007 the Highways Agency published Route Restraint Measures ‚Äì Explanation of the Further Change in the Traffic Forecasts and suggested that this data would not be available until Easter 2008. The inquiry reviewed this new information on 18 December 2007 at which time it was adjourned to allow the Highways Agency to correct their traffic modelling. The inspector commented that \\"it was the fifth iteration of the traffic model since the original announcement in February 2006\\". The inquiry was then \\"Adjourned Indefinitely Pending the Publication of Revised Evidence by The Highways Agency and Tameside MBC\\". On 3 March 2008 the Highways Agency responded to queries from the inspector indicating that it expected to have revised evidence available by October 2008. In September 2008 the Highways Agency indicated that the revised information would now be available for public consultation in May 2009 and that the public inquiry could start again in Autumn 2009. In February 2009 the Campaign for Better Transport reported that funding for the road scheme would not be available before 2016. In March 2009 the Highways Agency announced that it was pulling out of the public inquiry, citing the decision of the Regional Leaders' Forum, 4NW, to delay the start of the scheme by at least four years. The accompanying press release stated that \\"the extended period of time between the publication of the draft proposals for the scheme in 2007 and the earliest date at which the Inquiry might be reconvened\\" was a further factor in the decision to withdraw.

The campaign group support other measures that it considers would improve local transport without causing damage to the environment.\\"What are the alternatives?\\" , Campaign to Save Swallows Wood This alternative approach calls for: * Weight restrictions on the A57/628, forcing heavy goods traffic onto the existing M1/M62 motorway network and away from the Peak District National Park. (This has the drawback that the M1/M62 route through West Yorkshire is already one of the most congested pieces of motorway in Britain,BBC ‚Äì Travel News ‚Äì Leeds and West Yorkshire : Live Road Incidents in addition to the environmental consequences of almost doubling the distance of a typical Sheffield to Manchester journey.) * Weight restrictions on the A57/628 but only during rush-hour periods. (Subject to similar considerations as above.) * Road tolls on the A57/628. * Traffic calming in the villages on the A628 and A57 to prevent 'rat running'. * A ‚ÄòStreets for People‚Äô programme in all residential areas to encourage walking and cycling. * Continental-style safe routes to school. * Travel-to-work plans. * Integrated bus and train services throughout the Peak District and improved facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. * Discount travel by public transport. * Improved public transport links and safe cycle routes to local railway stations. * A new railway station at Gamesley and improved services at existing stations. Some opponents of the scheme also advocate 'Translink' as an alternative proposal, which envisages enabling (through the reopening of the Woodhead Tunnel) direct rail links between Glossop and Sheffield and beyond. Translink claims the \\"Rolling highway\\" would be a quick, safe and cost-effective means of carrying freight across the Pennines, a credible alternative to using the A616/A628 road. HGV vehicles would roll on and roll off the low-floor wagons.  Traffic figures  Whilst supporters of the scheme argue for the bypass on the basis that it will relieve the three villages of traffic congestion, the Highways Agency's own figures do not fully support this contention.\\"Predicted Traffic Flows With and Without the A57/A628 Bypass\\" , Route Restraint Environmental Statement, Vol 3-set02, Figure 1-5 (opens PDF) In the Environmental Statement produced by the Highways Agency, the 'Predicted Traffic Figures' support the following largely temporary reductions in traffic by 2010: * a 100% permanent reduction along the westbound section of the A57 after the junction with the A6018‚Äîthis is because this section of road will be blocked and made into a one-way street, making it impossible to access the A628. * a 13% reduction in traffic along Market Street (A628), Hollingworth (decreasing to 5% by 2025). * an 8% reduction in traffic along Mottram Moor (A57) (decreasing to 4% by 2025). All other routes show a marked increase in traffic, both immediately and over time: * Brookfield (A57)‚Äîan 18% increase by 2010 (rising to 21% by 2025). * M67‚Äîa 17% increase by 2010 (rising to 24% by 2025). * Back Moor (A6018)‚Äîa 9% increase by 2010 (rising to 23% by 2025). * Ashworth Lane (B6174)‚Äîa 6% increase by 2010 (rising to 36% by 2025). * Roe Cross Road (A6018)‚Äîa 6% increase by 2010 (rising to 36% by 2025). The aim of the bypass is to reduce traffic flow along (at least) the A57 and the reviewed environmental statement of February 2007 provided radically different traffic forecasts to the originals summarised above. In particular, the new forecast indicated that there would be over 26,000 vehicles per day travelling along Back Moor. According to the data presented by the Highways Agency, this amount of traffic is greater than that presently using the main A57 Hyde Road through Mottram. Climate change impacts Government-funded research carried out by English Nature found that the proposed scheme would increase greenhouse gas CO2 pollution in the area by 15,840 tonnes per annum. Furthermore, the costs of the CO2 pollution were not included in the Highways Agency cost‚Äìbenefit analysis.http://www.savemottram.org.uk/A628%20Response%20Report.doc In the republished Environmental Statement summary, the Highways Agency admit that the scheme will entail \\"an estimated increase of 9% in emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide\\".'A57/A628 Mottram-Tintwistle Bypass and A628/A616 Route Restraint Measures: Non-Technical Summary of the Environmental Statement', Highways Agency Publications, Manchester, 2007 However, in a Statement of the Area address on 21 November 2006, the Leader of Tameside Council announced that 4,500 trees had already been planted, increasing to 10,000 to compensate for the loss of trees when the bypass is built and to help mitigate the increases in CO2 emissions. The council leader also claimed that each tree planted would offset 75 kg of CO2 per annum. This figure‚Äîfor trees to be planted in northern England‚Äîis 3.5 times greater than that for trees planted in tropical rainforests.Trees for the Future > About Us > Global Cooling Centers In an alternative proposal to the bypass, Translink claim that the removal of HGVs from the A628 onto a cross-Peak train line would save approximately 100,000 tons of CO2 per year.Translink UK :: Benefits of a Rolling Highway See also *Woodhead Line *Campaign for Better Transport (UK) Notes References External links *Major roads investment in the north west official Highways Agency information about the scheme *December 2014 BBC report on scheme approval BBC Confirms Bypass Approved Category:Anti- road protest Category:Roads in England Category:Tameside Category:Proposed roads in the United Kingdom Category:Proposed transport infrastructure in the North West of England ","title":"Longdendale Bypass"},{"id":"7210682","text":"Xasthur () is the project of American musician Scott \\"Malefic\\" Conner. Conner formed Xasthur in 1995 and released eight studio albums of black metal by 2010, when he announced the end of the project. However, he revived it in 2015 to focus on acoustic neofolk music, releasing a ninth album, Subject to Change, in 2016.  Etymology  The name \\"Xasthur\\" is a combination of \\"Hastur\\" and \\"Xenaoth\\". Conner explained that he found the former name in a Necronomicon paperback and believed that it referred to \\"a demoness who kills people in their sleep\\". The latter name referred to a celestial deity he read about in a book on the Afro-Caribbean religion Santer√≠a.Roberto Martinelli:  History  Xasthur was created in December 1995 in Alhambra, California, after Conner had played with several local death metal groups in Southern California. Initially, the band began rehearsing and recording in a home studio with an unstable lineup. A 10-track tape of these early rehearsals was circulated on the trade scene. While the original of that tape was destroyed, some tracks appeared on re-releases of later albums. For a self-released split album with Orosius, Conner was joined on drums and vocals by friend Mike Pardi from the band Draconis, who used the stage name \\"Ritual.\\" Subsequently, Xasthur became Conner's solo project, although Khaija \\"Blood Moon\\" Ausar (of Dacon and Crimson Moon) later appeared as a session musician on the song \\"A Curse for the Lifeless\\" (from Nortt/Xasthur) and the EP Xasthur, Mark \\"M.H.\\" Hunter performed on Defective Epitaph and All Reflections Drained, and Marissa Nadler sang on Portal of Sorrow. Before releasing their first official full-length album in 2002, Xasthur recordings were distributed in limited editions, which were later re-released by the Swedish Total Holocaust Records and other small underground labels. The band's first album, Nocturnal Poisoning (recorded April‚ÄìSeptember 2001), was released by the Blood Fire Death label in 2002. Southern Lord Records re-released a remastered double-LP version in 2005. In the following years, Xasthur's releases were issued through a variety of labels including Bestial Onslaught Productions, Moribund Records, Profound Lore Records, Battle Kommand Records, Autopsy Kitchen Records, Hydra Head Records, Turanian Honour Productions, Avantgarde Music and Disharmonic Variations. Xasthur released several split albums with other black metal acts such as Acid Enema, Angra Mainyu, Black Circle, Nachtmystium, Leviathan, Nortt and Striborg; contributed to tribute albums to Burzum, Ildjarn, Judas Iscariot, Katatonia and Manes; and appeared on various compilation albums. Additionally, Conner collaborated with numerous bands including the drone metal project Sunn O))), Mord (with Lugubre members), Celestia and Gravesideservice, and participated on the first album by black metal \\"supergroup\\" Twilight. On March 26, 2010, Conner announced that he was wholesaling Xasthur's eighth studio album, Portal of Sorrow. He also stated that this would be the last album under the Xasthur moniker, as he was dissolving the Xasthur musical project. Conner cited a lack of motivation, among other aspects, for ending Xasthur; he also stated that there would not be a reunion of this band. Conner remarked that another, non-metal musical project was in the works, later revealed to be called Nocturnal Poisoning, named after his 2002 album. Nocturnal Poisoning released three albums between 2012 and 2014: Other Worlds of the Mind, A Misleading Reality and Doomgrass. On September 30, 2010, Conner released the first and only music video to date under the Xasthur name, for the song \\"Walker of Dissonant Worlds\\" from the To Violate the Oblivious album. Conner was featured in One Man Metal, a 2012 Noisey documentary alongside Jef Whitehead of Leviathan and Russell Menzies of Striborg. On March 5, 2015, Conner announced on the official Nocturnal Poisoning Facebook page that the band were reverting to the name Xasthur. In reclaiming the name, he said: \\"For five years, Nocturnal Poisoning was locked out and denied every opportunity or open door that Xasthur used to have, or would've had. I worked hard at building up both projects, starting both of them from nothing and nowhere, but I'm taking back what's mine. Xasthur doesn't belong to the greedy hipsters that milk the metal business; it belongs to me and it's mine to take back.\\" He noted that a new Xasthur album would be available in 2016 on the Disharmonic Variations label, and that the current version of the band (including contributions from Nocturnal Poisoning associate members Christopher Hernandez and Robert Nesslin) would be a continuation of Nocturnal Poisoning's acoustic-driven music, saying, \\"There's no need to rehash old Xasthur songs, the acoustic ones are plenty dark, and sometimes they're not. If you've been listening, reading, thinking and getting it, we could call it Xasthur acoustic/unplugged with, whatever, a country, blues, 'folk', bluegrass, doomgrass or singer/songwriter style and technique in it\\". On April 16, Xasthur's first-ever live concert appearance was announced, to take place on June 19, 2015 at the Thirst for Light: Cascadian Summer Solstice II festival at Red Hawk Avalon in Pe Ell, Washington. On September 4, the title for the next Xasthur album was announced as Subject to Change; it was released May 6, 2016 by Disharmonic Variations.  Influences  Conner has noted other one-man black metal projects such as Burzum and Graveland as an inspiration for his singular approach: \\"The main way that Burzum inspired me (contrary to popular belief) was that he could do it all on his own-- why couldn't I?\\" Although similar in terms of low fidelity production and the wearing of corpse paint, musically and lyrically, the focus of the first edition of Xasthur was usually not on paganism, Satanism or anti- Christian blasphemy ‚Äì as is common in the black metal genre ‚Äì but rather on astral projection, darkness, despair, suicide, hate and death.  Live  Conner has toured with Sunn O))) and has joined Nachtmystium onstage,Some video clips of these performances are available on YouTube. but until recently, stated that he \\"will always keep Xasthur a band that will not play live\\". However, Xasthur's first live concert took place in June 2015.

It was the worst mass murder in Orange County until the 2011 Seal Beach shooting, in which eight people died. Allaway had a history of violence and mental illness. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and found insane by a judge after being convicted by a jury. He was initially imprisoned at Patton State Hospital under medical treatment. In 2016 he was transferred to Napa State Hospital.  Events  The gunman, 37-year-old Edward Charles Allaway, was a custodian at the university's library. Armed with a .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle he purchased at a Buena Park Kmart, Allaway killed seven people and injured two others in the library's first-floor lobby and at the building's Instructional Media Center (IMC), located in the basement. Witnesses told investigators that Allaway's attack began shortly before 7am, with some witnesses claiming the gunfire was like a machine gun in a movie, while others likened it to a \\"popping\\" noise. He reportedly chased down Deborah Paulsen and Donald Karges before killing them, and shot Bruce Jacobson after Jacobson attempted to subdue him with a metal statue. After shooting Seth Fessenden and Paul Herzberg, he took a service elevator down to the first floor and shot Frank Teplansky and left a visiting high school student unharmed, he then shot Stephen Becker before he ran out of bullets. An eyewitness who was a part of a high school program, stated Allaway was agitated when he saw him. The eyewitness stated that he saw Allaway pass by him and another counselor who had gone into the hallway to investigate the noises. Allaway reportedly stated \\"He doesn't belong here; he doesn't belong here.\\" before aiming his rifle at the eyewitness and the other counselor. However, instead of firing at the two individuals Allaway lowered the gun and ran in the opposite direction, and soon after the two could hear more gunfire. Allaway fled the school campus, went to Hilton Inn Hotel a nearby hotel in Anaheim, where his former wife worked, and telephoned police to report his actions. He told them, \\"I went berserk at Cal State Fullerton, and I committed some terrible act. I'd appreciate it if you people would come down and pick me up. I'm unarmed, and I'm giving myself up to you.\\"  Victims  The deceased victims were Paul Herzberg, 30, Bruce Jacobson, 32, Donald Karges, 41, Deborah Paulsen, 25, Seth Fessenden, 72, Frank Teplansky, 51 and Stephen Becker, 32. The injured victims were Maynard Hoffman, 64 and Donald Keran, 55.  Perpetrator  Allaway was found guilty of six counts of first degree murder and one count of second degree murder. A second phase of the trial determined that he was not sane. Five different mental health professionals diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. He presented a history of mental illness, as he had tried to commit suicide and had been hospitalized and treated with electroconvulsive therapy in the past. He was committed to the California state mental hospital system, beginning at Atascadero State Hospital. He was then transferred and held at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino. In 2016, he was transferred to the less secure Napa State Hospital. The families of Allaway's victims protested his transfer. He was found to have injured a co-worker at a Michigan plant. A short time before the shooting rampage, he had threatened his wife with a knife and raped her. Allaway's apparent motive was that he had delusions that pornographers were forcing his wife to appear in movies. The couple had separated over Memorial Day Weekend 1976 after a blow-up. His wife had filed for divorce shortly before Allaway attacked co-workers at the university. The defense alleged that library staff members screened commercial pornographic movies before library opening hours and in break rooms, but Allaway's wife was not in them.  Trial and release hearings  After a 1977 jury convicted Allaway of murder but deadlocked in the sanity phase of the trial, a judge found Allaway not guilty by reason of insanity. By law, defendants found insane are committed to a mental institution until they are found sane. Allaway remained institutionalized at Patton State Hospital for a number of years. During his time at Patton, Allaway made several failed petitions to the courts asking for his release. He was eventually transferred to Napa State Hospital in 2016 where he currently resides. In the summer of 2009, officials at Patton indicated that Allaway was asymptomatic, had not needed medication, and they would recommend his release. The district attorney contacted the governor and the state mental health director to protest the hospital's planned action, given his history of violence and the mass murder. Patton withdrew the recommendation for release a few months later. Victim Steve Becker's father was the university's founding dean of students. He provided comments against Allaway's release on several occasions.  Aftermath  Survivors and family of the deceased victims comforted the fortieth anniversary of the attack with a candlelight vigil.

As a gift, the U.S. government sent China a pair of musk oxen. The pandas had been captured in the wild in June and December 1971. They arrived at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., on April 16, 1972, and were formally received several days later, on April 20, at a ceremony attended by First Lady Pat Nixon. While at the zoo, they attracted millions of visitors each year. During their time at the National Zoo, the pair had five cubs, but none of them survived past a few days. Ling-Ling died suddenly from heart failure on December 30, 1992, at which time she was the longest-lived giant panda in captivity outside China. Hsing-Hsing would go on to pass her record when he was euthanized by zookeepers on November 28, 1999 at the age of 28 due to painful kidney failure. Following Hsing-Hsing's death, the zoo received thousands of letters and cards from people across the country expressing sympathy.

The cartoon features music by and a special guest appearance from jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong and his Orchestra playing \\"You Rascal You\\". The title of the film comes from the song, written by Sam Theard in 1931.Shapiro, Nat. Popular Music: Volume 4 1930-39, Adrian Press, 1968. P. 64. The film is now in the public domain . Plot After a live action introduction featuring Louis Armstrong and his orchestra, the short opens in the jungle, with Betty being carried on a litter by Bimbo and Koko. A horde of African savages descends on the trio, and runs off with Betty. Koko and Bimbo try to find the missing Betty, but end up in the cannibals' cooking pot. They climb a tree and escape, but are pursued by the enormous disembodied head of a savage (with the voice and face of Louis Armstrong). Koko and Bimbo eventually find Betty tied to a stake, surrounded by dancing natives. Koko and Bimbo help Betty escape by firing porcupine quills at the savages. The trio races off, hotly pursued by spear-tossing natives. The three finally reach safety after crossing a mountain, the erupting peak of which flings the savages into space. Notes and comments * This is one of Louis Armstrong's earliest film appearances. Armstrong and his orchestra perform \\"High Society Rag,\\" the title song, and \\"Chinatown.\\" The use of a currently popular musician represented competition with the contemporaneous music library accessibility greatly exploited by animators Hugh Harman and Carl Ising, when producing musically-synchronized shorts for the Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies series. * Thomas Brothers has noted the racist imagery and dialogue in this short film. In addition to the depiction of black people as cannibals and savages, Koko calls the savages \\"babies,\\" short for \\"jungle babies.\\" During the vocal chorus, the cannibal's face and Louis Armstrong's face oscillate between one another, associating Armstrong himself with the cannibal characters. * Inspired by the song title is the Spanish \\"Raska-y√∫\\", by P. Bonet de San Pedro and Bartolom√© de Lete (performed by San Pedro and Los siete de Palma). It became a hit during the summer of 1943. It mixes the American \\"Rascal You\\" with Alberto Villal√≥n's \\"Boda negra\\" lyrics. The Spanish \\"Raska-y√∫\\" remains a kitsch cult song. * A speedometer in Koko's tail at one point registers the Hebrew word ◊õ÷º◊©◊® (kosher). * Buck Woods, portraying a jazz singer in Reunion in France, a 1942 film starring John Wayne and Joan Crawford, sings this song in Paris nightclub during the Nazi occupation during World War II.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0940526/filmotype * Sammy Davis, Jr. won his first talent contest at the age of 3 when he sang this song.

It rises in a marshy area on the border of Lyndeborough and Mont Vernon, and flows south over three small waterfalls, intersecting the Souhegan in Milford. For much of its length, it constitutes the border between Lyndeborough and Mont Vernon. Mont Vernon town histories say it is unclear where the name \\"Purgatory\\" came from. At least one other brook with the same name exists in nearby Massachusetts. The northernmost cascade, Upper Purgatory Falls, drew many visitors in the late 19th and early 20th century when Mont Vernon was home to a number of hotels that drew summer visitors from the heat of Boston. At one time the area had a dance hall and a bowling alley, as well as camping sites - none of which exist today. Also, there used to be railings, and evidence of these are still visible as metal poles. Townwide celebrations drew hundreds of people up through the Great Depression, according to Mont Vernon town histories. Today the upper falls can only be reached on the Mont Vernon side by four-wheel drive vehicles, and on the Lyndeborough side by a short walk from a town-maintained road. The lowest waterfall can only be reached by a short hiking trail. The middle waterfall can be reached along a public trail, the length of the brook.

The Occupation of Vojvodina (a province of modern Serbia) from 1941 to 1944 was carried out by Nazi Germany and its client states / puppet regimes: Horthy's Hungary and Independent State of Croatia. In 1941, during World War II, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Hungary invaded and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The modern-day Vojvodina region (then the northern part of Danube Banovina province of Yugoslavia) was divided into three occupation zones: Banat was part of the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia and was de facto under control of its ethnic German minority; Baƒçka was attached to Horthy's Hungary; while Syrmia was attached to Independent State of Croatia. The occupation lasted until 1944, when the region came under control of the Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans.

Without any delay the most cruel measures were introduced: the plunder of Jewish property was completed to be absolutely total; Jews had to wear the yellow mark; they were all confined to transit camps before very long to be taken, sometime in June 1944 first to Hungary and then to concentration camps in Austria and Germany. Most of them ended their journey in Auschwitz. Very few of them succeeded to survive and to return. Genocide in Baƒçka claimed a total of 14,000 Jewish victims. According to available data out of the Jewish victims of genocide 3,800 were from Banat, 11,000 from Serbia and about 260 from Sand≈æak.

Liberation struggle Liberated partisan territory in Syrmia in the end of 1942. Syrmian frontline before April 1945. The resistance movement against Axis occupation was started in summer of 1941 by the communists. The resistance in Banat and Baƒçka was soon defeated, while resistance in Syrmia had more success. The Syrmian resistance movement grew into a popular uprising, and a large liberated territory (that included about 40 villages) was established in Syrmia. On liberated territory, a partisan authority was organized, which included mass anti-fascist organizations, publishing activity, and education. The experiences of the resistance movement in Syrmia were transferred to Banat and Baƒçka in the summer of 1944; before the Soviet Red Army arrived in October 1944, Vojvodina already had its new institutions of people's administration. The liberation movement was organized into 18 Vojvodinian brigades divided into 3 squadrons. 15,000 fighters of the resistance movement were killed during the liberation struggle.

Historically the focus has been on the cinematic form rather than literature and art, but this has broadened to include all forms in recent years. People in attendance at a horror convention are traditionally known as members of the convention; invited celebrities including film directors and stars are commonly known as guests of the convention, though many professionals including directors will simply attend as members. Anatomy of a typical horror convention Getting started The first morning of most conventions, the \\"Opening Ceremonies\\" are held, where organizers and marquee guests are introduced and speeches might be made. Some conventions such as Weekend of Horrors will play horror-themed music and video. Program Panel-led discussions, or Panels, usually fill up the daytime hours of most conventions with typically one-hour discussions of topics related to horror films, horror literature, and fandom in general. Evening entertainment often includes a combination of official and unofficial events, including dances, formal invitational dinners, and fandom-themed room parties. A bid party is a room party held to influence the choice of the location of a future convention by advertising its advantages. A costume contest called a masquerade is often held where persons go on stage and compete for nominal prizes based on their skill in assembling and presenting horror-inspired outfits. This is truly more a \\"talent show\\" rather than the \\"fancy dress ball\\" that the term suggests (although British fandom sometimes uses the term \\"fancy dress\\"). Specific rooms A Dealer's or Huckster's Room is available, where merchants sell wares of interest to fans. These include books, action figures, prop replicas and t-shirts. Smaller conventions may simply have an informal Dealer's Row, a section of hotel rooms from which dealers sell goods, while larger conventions may have both an official dealer's room and an unofficial dealer's row. Many conventions have video rooms, in which genre-related audiovisual presentations take place and/or films and trailers are shown. Ending the event Often the \\"Closing Ceremonies\\" on the convention's last day are dispensed with entirely. This omission is because such ceremonies would logically be held after scheduled events are over, and convention members are occupied with packing up and checking out of the hotel. Ceremony or not, a dead dog party is likely to be held. This is the traditional winding-down party where few of the attendees are likely to have huge amounts of energy. This party is an attempt to ease people back into the real world outside of convention and can be an effective method of warding off the depression, which is often associated with the end of a major event. Analogies can be drawn to the decompression parties following large events such as Burning Man.

It was originally designed by Lars Knudsen as a dedicated attack against Square, so it is commonly known as the Square attack. It was also extended to a few other ciphers related to Square: CRYPTON, Rijndael, and SHARK. Stefan Lucks generalized the attack to what he called a saturation attack and used it to attack Twofish, which is not at all similar to Square, having a radically different Feistel network structure. Forms of integral cryptanalysis have since been applied to a variety of ciphers, including Hierocrypt, IDEA, Camellia, Skipjack, MISTY1, MISTY2, SAFER++, KHAZAD, and FOX (now called IDEA NXT). Unlike differential cryptanalysis, which uses pairs of chosen plaintexts with a fixed XOR difference, integral cryptanalysis uses sets or even multisets of chosen plaintexts of which part is held constant and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 8 of their bits the same, but all differ in those 8 bits. Such a set necessarily has an XOR sum of 0, and the XOR sums of the corresponding sets of ciphertexts provide information about the cipher's operation. This contrast between the differences of pairs of texts and the sums of larger sets of texts inspired the name \\"integral cryptanalysis\\", borrowing the terminology of calculus.

It is possible there's a direct link with the murder of Yan Segunin two weeks before. * October 7, 2006 - Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya was found shot dead in the elevator of her apartment block in central Moscow with four gunshot wounds, news agencies reported. She was a prominent critic of the Chechen War and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In 2001, after the general election of December 2001, the PNM was appointed by the then President of Trinidad and Tobago, A.N.R. Robinson, as the government, although it had tied, 18 seats to 18 seats, with the United National Congress in the election. In this short-lived government, which lasted for 9-month until the financial year expired in September 2002, Imbert served as Minister of Health 2002 Imbert won his seat once more in 2002 and was re-elected the Member of Parliament for the constituency of Diego Martin East. He was re-appointed Minister of Health and served in that position until 2003, when he was appointed Minister of Science, Technology and Tertiary Education. In 2005, after the resignation of the then Minister of Works and Transport, Franklin Khan, Imbert was appointed Minister of Works and Transport. 2007 In 2007, his constituency, Diego Martin East, was renamed Diego Martin North/East due to boundary changes, and in the general election of 2007, Imbert won his seat again, for the sixth time. He was re-appointed Minister of Works and Transport and served in this position until the general election of May 2010, when the PNM lost the government. Imbert was also appointed as the Leader of Government Business in the House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago from November 2007 to May 2010 2010 In the 2010 general election, after the then Prime Minister Patrick Manning called a snap election, Imbert won his seat, Diego Martin North/East, for the seventh time. However, the PNM lost the overall election, winning only 12 out of 41 seats in the House of Representatives, and he became a member of the Parliamentary Opposition for the second time in his political career. 2015 In the 2015 general election held on 7 September, Imbert once again won the seat of Diego Martin North/East with the largest ever vote count in his political career. With a tally of over 12,000 votes, Imbert defeated his rival by a margin greater than 7000 votes. The People's National Movement won the general election with 23 out of the possible 41 seats and following this victory, Imbert was appointed Minister of Finance by Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley. 2020 In the 2020 Trinidad and Tobago general election held on 10 August, Imbert won the seat of Diego Martin North/East for the 9th time, again by a margin of over 7,000 votes. The People's National Movement won the general election with 22 out of the 41 seats at stake, giving Prime Minister Rowley and the PNM a second consecutive term in Government.

The term is used to describe concrete that is left unfinished after being cast, displaying the patterns and seams imprinted on it by the formwork.Exposed concrete. In: B√©ton brut is not a material itself, but rather an architectural expression of concrete.  History  Detail of the Royal National Theatre showing the grain of the formwork Example of large board form concrete formwork, constructed to create a complex concrete wall form with the raw concrete aesthetic of b√©ton brut The use of b√©ton brut was pioneered by modernist architects such as Auguste Perret and Le Corbusier. Le Corbusier coined the term b√©ton brut during the construction of Unit√© d'Habitation in Marseille, France built in 1952. The term began to spread widely after the British architectural critic Reyner Banham used it in the title of his 1966 book, The New Brutalism: Ethic or Aesthetic?, to characterize a recent cluster of new architectural design, particularly in Europe. B√©ton brut became popular among modern architects, leading to the creation of the brutalist architecture style which thrived in the 1950s-1970's. Brutalism stems from the philosophies of Modern architecture that promote the truth to materials which is achieved by their raw expression. The essence of the philosophy is seen in the imperfections of b√©ton brut which stem from the idea to create an aesthetic based on the exposure of a building's components, including the frame, sheathing, and mechanical systems. The result is the visibility of the imprinted seams and construction methods of the formwork used to mold the concrete. This style of concrete is a part of structural expressionism, which emerged as steel structures became more advanced and viable. Fabrication Closeup of board form concrete After being cast, concrete will usually have a finishing treatment that smooths its surface, ridding it of any imperfections. In the case of b√©ton brut, the concrete is left unfinished, expressing the pattern left by the formwork. Formwork is used in concrete construction as the frame for a structure in which fresh concrete is poured to then harden and take on the desired shape. Aesthetic of concrete surfaces can be varied with different formwork sheathing (e.g. board shuttering, smooth formwork, form liner, form moulds, filter fleeces). The type of material used to create the formwork (i.e. glass, wood, steel etc.) will have effects on the appearance of the final product. When Corbusier coined the term, he was specifically responding to board-marked concrete, which he used to construct many of his post-World War II buildings. When the formwork is lined with wood it is called board form. When lumber is used to create the formwork, the concrete picks up the grain structure as it sets, resulting in a texture on the poured concrete that resembles the wood. It is important to use the same type of wood throughout the job, especially on larger buildings where the molds may get repeated uses, because the lumber can absorb moisture, which may possibly affect the color of the concrete. Other raw patterns can be created by using textured metal formwork, or having the aggregate bush or pick hammered. Wood-imprinted concrete is still popular in landscaping, especially in some western European countries. Examples of b√©ton brut seen at the Bauhaus Museum Surface processing techniques (e.g., washed concrete surfaces, photo concrete, acidified surfaces) can also be used to create the aesthetic of b√©ton brut. Particularly high-quality poured concrete, achieved by leaving enough room between the formwork and the reinforcing bars for the concrete to flow freely, is called Sichtbeton in German and cemento a vista in Italian. Both terms translate roughly to \\"concrete for viewing\\".

The play premiered at the Theater of the Riverside Churchhttps://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/14/archives/theater-short-eyes-prison- drama-play-by-miguel-pinero-moves-to-the.html, was then produced off-Broadway at the Joseph Papp Public Theater on February 28, 1974, and transferred after 54 performances to the Vivian Beaumont Theater on Broadway on May 23, 1974. Short Eyes, prison slang for a child molester, was written for a prisoners' writing workshop during Pi√±ero's incarceration for armed robbery. Characters * Clark Davis: a middle-class white man in his mid-twenties accused of raping a young girl. While it is never explicitly stated whether he committed the crime he is accused of, it is made clear that he is a pedophile who has molested several other children. * Juan Otero: A Puerto Rican man in his early thirties. He is liked and respected by his fellow prisoners and the guards alike. * Cupcakes: A Puerto Rican \\"pretty boy\\" of 21 who is coveted by many of the House's convicts. * Paco: A Puerto Rican drug addict with predatory designs on Cupcakes. * Longshoe: A tough, hip Irishman in his mid- thirties, and the only white prisoner whom the black and Hispanic prisoners respect. He despises Davis. * Ice: A tough, angry African-American man in his late twenties. * El Raheem: A Black Muslim who preaches the word of Allah to his fellow prisoners. * Omar: An African-American amateur boxer in his mid- twenties. * Mr. Nett: An old-line prison guard who takes an immediate dislike to Davis. * Captain Allard: Nett's superior officer. Imposing and macho, he has little patience for the prisoners. Plot summary The play is set in an unnamed House of Detention in New York City, the inmates of which are predominantly black or Latino. One day, a new prisoner is brought in: Clark Davis, a young, middle-class white man accused of raping a young girl. His fellow prisoners immediately turn on him -- child molesters are considered the lowest form of prison life -- except for Juan, one of the institution's older prisoners, who treats him with dignity. While Davis insists he doesn't remember raping the girl, he admits that he has molested several other children. It is eventually revealed that the police's case against Davis is weak, and he will likely be released. This puts Juan in a difficult position: on one hand, he feels a grudging pity for Davis, and \\"snitching\\" on another prisoner, even one as despised as Davis, could get him killed; on the other, there is no doubt in his mind that Davis will \\"scar up some more little girls' minds\\" if released. Before he can decide what to do, however, Davis is attacked and killed by the other prisoners. The play also revolves around other features of prison life, such as the day-to-day attempts to accumulate privileges from the guards and \\"rap sessions\\" in which prisoners joke, flirt, and threaten each other. Reception In 1974, the play was presented at Riverside Church in Manhattan. Theater impresario Joseph Papp saw the play and was so impressed that he moved the production to Broadway. The play was nominated for six Tony Awards. It won the New York Critics Circle Award and an Obie Award for the \\"best play of the year\\". The play was also a success in Europe, and catapulted Pi√±ero to literary fame. Short Eyes was published in book form by the editorial house Hill & Yang. Walter Kerr of The New York Times said the play was \\"promising\\" but \\"not yet freed from its initial debt to life.\\"  Film adaptation  In 1977, the play was adapted for a film, directed by Robert M. Young from a script by Pi√±ero. The film starred Bruce Davison as Davis, Pi√±ero as Go-Go and Luis Guzm√°n. Curtis Mayfield appeared in the film and composed and performed the soundtrack.

Siata initially sold performance parts to modify and tune cars manufactured by Fiat. After World War II, the company began making its own sports cars under the Siata brand until its eventual bankruptcy following the first Arab oil embargo in the mid-1970s. History First production models: 1948-1952 1952 Siata 300BC Barchetta Sport Spider Production of the Siata's first wholly original design the Siata Amica began in 1948 and continued through 1952. The Amica was powered by a Fiat 500 cc engine capable of producing 22 horsepower with an optional 750 cc unit producing 25 horsepower. The Amica was available in both two-seater convertible/spider and coup√© configurations. A specially modified Amica known as the Fiat Siata 500 Pescara won the 1948 Italian Road Racing Championship fitted with a five-speed manual gearbox and a modified 500 cc engine producing 40 horsepower. Only two 500 Pescaras were ever built with only one surviving model. The surviving car also competed in the 1991 Historic Millie Miglia.  Daina and 300BC  The Daina was based on heavily modified Fiat 1400 mechanics; the frame was reinforced and shortened while the engine was tuned by Siata. The Daina could be had with a 1.4L (1,395 cc), 1.5L (1,500 cc) or 1.8L (1,817 cc) overhead valve I4 engine, all of which were sourced from Fiat. From 1950 to 1958 there were approximately 50 Daina Series cars produced. However, only a few of the Series were produced after 1953. About 20 Daina Sport (coupes) are thought to have been built, only six are known to exist today. A cabriolet version called the Gran Sport comprised most of the Daina Series cars. The Gran Sport had a steel body with an aluminum hood designed by Stabilimenti Farina (3 all aluminum bodied Gran Sports were made as well) but when they closed in 1953, Bertone took over production with a coupe model of their own design called the \\"Sport\\". Following the Amica, Siata introduced the 300BC Barchetta Sport Spider in 1951. The Barchetta Sport Spider was designed by Mario Revelli de Beaumont and built by Nuccio Bertone and Rocco Motto. Around 50 production models were created and predominantly featured either a 750 cc Crosley or 1100 cc Fiat engine. During this time Siata also created the Cucciolo (\\"puppy\\") motor sold in kit form by Ducati and later used to power Ducati's first complete mopeds and motorcycles starting in 1952. 8V Fiat engine and the 208S: 1953-1955 Siata 208S Siata introduced the 208S in 1953 featuring Fiat's 2.0 liter 8V engine. 35 cars were produced between 1953 and 1955 priced at 5300 dollars and available in both convertible and hard top. The car rose to prominence after actor and race car driver Steve McQueen purchased model BS523 from Los Angeles-based Siata importer Ernie McAfee in the mid-1950s. McQueen reportedly re badged the car with Ferrari emblems and dubbed the car his \\"Little Ferrari\\". End of Siata: 1968-1975 1968 Siata Spring In 1968, after a detailed market research among Italian youth, Siata launched the Siata Spring, a sports car based on parts from Fiat 850, with a front end styled by Enrico Fumia in 1966. The Siata Spring was produced until 1970, when Siata went bankrupt, but the assembly line was purchased by a newly formed company called ORSA (Officina Realizzazioni Sarde Automobili). They moved it to an assembly plant near Cagliari, where it resumed the production of the Spring, which was now based on the SEAT 850 Special. Because of this the engine displacement increased to 903cc with 47BHP, and it gained disc brakes on the front wheels and a higher top speed of 125 km/h (77.6 mph). Due to the 1973 oil crisis sales of sports cars in Italy went down, forcing ORSA to end the production of the Spring in 1975.

Demolition of the former junior high school building, which recently moved to the campus in Tontogany, commenced in early July 2008. In 2009 the State of Ohio notified the Otsego Board of Education that the district did not have sufficient numbers of elementary students to justify building two schools. Consequently, the Board opted to build a single school in Tontogany in December 2009. Ground breaking for the new school was held in August 2010. Notable alumni *Edward C.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 661. It lies just north of Interstate 10 and to the west of Columbus.  History  Located along the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad, the town site was originally established by the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway in 1885.TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association The post office was opened three years later, and the town served as a major railroad maintenance facility stop between Houston and El Paso. The community flourished during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the two world wars. Shortly after, the railroad movement from steam engines to those operating with diesel and electric rendered most of the railroad maintenance shops in Glidden obsolete.Glidden, Texas This caused the population to decrease to 150 residents by the late 1940s. Between January 1911 and April 1912, a series of ax murders occurred in Texas and Louisiana, claiming 49 victims. Glidden was one of the numerous towns in which this type of homicide took place. It is believed that all victims died at the hands of an unidentified killer (or killers) during the reign of terror. In Glidden, a woman with her four children and a male guest were all murdered in their sleep in March 1912.Unsolved Serial Killings; Louisiana And Texas There were several individuals suspected in the crimes in the different locations, but charges were dropped against all of them for lack of evidence. The murder cases remain unsolved. Geography Glidden is located in north-central Colorado County and is bordered to the east by the city of Columbus, the county seat.

Part of their WaveRunner line of watercraft, the Yamaha WaveBlaster 700 (Marine Jet 700TZ) made its debut in 1993. Although technically a runabout style PWC the blaster is more closely related to the SuperJet. Yamaha's design philosophy for the Blaster was simplicity over comfort. Just handle bars with a trigger throttle and a motorcycle style seat made this a performance craft, that let riders enjoy sharply banked turns, tail stands and other acrobatic maneuvers. The performance character and lean in style turning is primarily due to the soft chines but are further enhanced by concave sections near the bow and Strakes along the hull. The claimed top speed was 44-45 mph. With its powerful engine, semi flat-bottomed hull, and chrome-alloy piston rings, this is a model that still has many devoted fans today. The drawbacks to the design is its high center of gravity making it difficult to ride at idle speeds, difficulty at boarding in deep water and somewhat athletic skills required.

It was the world‚Äôs first sit-down type solo riding personal water craft. The combination of a fixed steering column and small hull made this a particularly agile model. It featured a 500cc twin cylinder engine, with a top speed around 25-30 mph on a smooth lake. The engine can be replaced with the newer 701cc engine, with minimal fitting problems.Yamaha, WaveRunner history 1993 through 1994 The craft remained unchanged with the 61X cases and blue/purple color paint commonly referred to as \\"blurple\\". 1995 Yamaha changed the color to red. 1996 Yamaha added dual 38mm Mikuni carburetors and 62T cases to the WaveBlaster, resulting in slightly more power, from 63 to 73 hp. This model was discontinued in 1996. 1997 through 1998 Yamaha changed the color scheme to blue and white and renamed the machine to WaveBlaster Limited (not available in USA). Summary This ski came from the factory as a stripped down no-frills machine ‚Äî- it does not have a tachometer, speedometer, GPS, rear view mirrors, cup holder, ice box, luggage compartment or a reverse mechanism that are typical of larger multi-person skis. Yamaha also manufactured a WaveBlaster 2 and a WaveBlaster 3, the latter more commonly known as the WB800 in reference to its 800cc motor. The WaveBlaster has been described by many as \\"the closest thing to riding a motorcycle on water\\".

(2003).Bosnak, Robert. (2007). and based on principles first developed by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, especially in his work on alchemy,Jung in Schwartz-Salant, Nathan (Ed.). (1995). and on the work of American archetypal psychologist James Hillman, who focused on soul as a simultaneous multiplicity of autonomous states.Hillman, James. (1975). pp. 30-35. The technique of embodied imagination takes dreaming as the paradigm for all work with images. While dreaming, everyone experiences dreams as embodied events in time and space; that is, the dreamer is convinced that he or she is experiencing a real event in a real environment. Bosnak describes how a dream \\"instantaneously presents a total world, so real that you are convinced you are awake. You don't just think so, you know it in the same way you now know you are awake reading this book.\\"Bosnak, Robert. (2007). p. 9. So from the perspective of dreaming, the image is a place.Bosnak, Robert. (2007). p. 9. Based on this notion, the dreamer can re-enter the landscape of the dream and flash back into its images to more fully and deeply explore and experience them. The dreamer explores the images of the dream while in a hypnagogic state, a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping. While in this state, the dreamer is asked a series of questions that help him or her to re-experience the dream by describing details of its landscape and image. Once fully immersed in the images that the dream environment presents, the dreamer is then also invited to feel and identify the feelings and sensations manifested in the body from a variety of dream perspectives. Perspectives explored are both that of the dream ego as well any \\"others\\" that appear in the dream. These \\"others\\" may be, for example, another person, an animal, or a physical object. Approaching dream figures in this way is consistent with archetypal psychologist James Hillman's prescription for therapeutic work in regard to the phenomena of psychic multiplicity. Drawing upon Carl Jung's realization that \\"the ego complex is not the only complex in the psyche,\\" Hillman described the psyche to be not a singular unified whole defined by the ego point of view, but rather a self-organizing multiplicity of autonomous selves.Hillman, James. (1975). p. 31. In the technique of embodied imagination, for each of these \\"selves\\" or \\"states\\" representing various perspectives, the dreamer then feels, identifies, and locates the feelings and sensations in his or her body. At the conclusion of the dreamwork session, the dreamer simultaneously holds in conscious awareness these differentiated and complex states of embodied feeling and sensation. The act of holding these multiple disparate states at the same time creates a psychical tension from which a completely new image or feeling state spontaneously emerges from the dreamer's psyche. This new image or state presents a completely new and previously unknown awareness to the dreamer, one through which the dreamer often feels changed, transformed, or greatly expanded in the ability to embody and feel intensely. After working with a dream in this way, one dreamer, a woman whose name is Ariel, later reflected, \\"That dreamwork warded off my seasonal depression which always starts in the autumn. I could already feel it creeping up at the time of the dream. And with the dreamwork it just stopped and retreated and never came back. I didn't have it all winter.\\"Bosnak, Robert. (2007). p. 134. Ariel's transformation is typical of those who practice this method of working with dreams. Using the technique of embodied imagination in dreamwork, the body becomes the theater for a vivid complexity of states, which leads along \\"alchemical\\" lines to profound psychical transformation. Practice Working with both dreams and memories, embodied imagination is practiced individually and in groups in psychotherapy, medicine, theater, art and creative research. The technique has been used as a rehearsal method by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and the Bell Shakespeare Company in Sydney. Both its simple rules and emphasis on group participation augment working on the Internet, where this technique is practiced in small dream groups using on-line voice chat forums such as Paltalk.See the website *Cyberdreamwork for more information about participating in dreamwork through on-line chat groups. A simplified form of Embodied Imagination for creativity is called DreamPlay Professional societies On November 3, 2006, the International Society for Embodied Imagination was founded at a conference in Guangzhou, China.

Background and training Stella Roman (n√©e Florica Viorica Alma Stela Blasu) was born in 1904 in Kolozsv√°r, Austria-Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania). She came from a musical background, and studied singing for eight years before making her concert d√©but in Cluj and then in Bucharest. She then won a scholarship to continue her training in Italy with the great verismo interpreter , of whom she later said: \\"her style did not really suit me\\".Rasponi, Lanfranco. The last prima donnas. (London, Gollancz, 1984), pp.553-560. Roman moved on to study with Hariclea Darcl√©e (who had created the title role of Tosca at the premi√®re in 1900), and was much happier under her guidance: \\"she taught me the value of every word and phrase\\". Career Her operatic d√©but was, by her own account, at Bologna in 1934 in the role of Maddalena in Andrea Ch√©nier, (though other accounts mention a performance in Piacenza in 1932). She sang Tosca at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples which inaugurated a long partnership with the tenor Giacomo Lauri-Volpi. In 1937 she was offered a three-year contract at Rome Opera House by Tullio Serafin, and she found herself making a sudden d√©but as Aida. It was as Aida that she also made her first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1941, and she continued to sing there throughout the 1940s in the Italian repertoire: Il trovatore, Otello, Un ballo in maschera, Cavalleria rusticana, La Gioconda, Tosca. She often shared these roles at the Met with Zinka Milanov. She left the Met in 1951 after the arrival of Rudolf Bing as its general manager. Stella Roman had a particular association with Richard Strauss, who chose her to sing the role of the Empress in Die Frau ohne Schatten for its Italian premi√®re at La Scala in 1940. She later went to visit Strauss at Pontresina in 1948 to study with him the Four Last Songs and the role of the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier, and it was as the Marschallin that she ended her career at the San Carlo theatre in Naples. She retired in 1953 after having married for the second time; her operatic career had lasted for 19 years. Her voice was admired for its warm lyrical quality and its ability to deliver high pianissimi and vibrant climaxes, but her technique was said to be \\"unorthodox and sometimes hectic\\".Schauensee, Max de. \\"Stella Roman\\", in Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 29 September 2006), After her retirement, she took up painting and her work was exhibited. She died in New York at the age of 87. Recordings Several of Roman's performance at the Metropolitan Opera were recorded and have now been reissued on CD, including: * Un ballo in maschera, as Amelia, conducted by E.Panizza. February 1942. * La forza del destino, as Leonora, conducted by Bruno Walter. January 1943. (Of this performance, Alan Blyth has written: \\"Stella Roman ... yields few points to such notable interpreters as Ponselle, Milanov and Tebaldi ... she uses her warm generous voice to unerring effect\\".) * Otello, as Desdemona, with Torsten Ralf, conducted by George Szell. 1946. In addition, a recording of assorted opera arias with Artur Rodzi≈Ñski conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic, along with excerpts from Verdi's Aida with Karl Kritz conducting (1945‚Äì50), was released on Eklipse in 1997. Roman also reported that she had made some recordings of Romanian folk-songs with her compatriot George Enescu, but it is not certain whether these were ever released.

Biography Born in Wolverhampton in 1866, although his father was a master butcher, Charles Harry Jones became a gardener. He worked on a number of private estates in England from the 1890s, including Great Ote Hall, near Burgess Hill, Sussex. His gardening was noted for the quality of his flowerbeds and cultivation of fruits and vegetables. He was also ingenious in providing a long season for fruit and vegetables. As a photographer, Jones was noted for his documentation of the fruits of his gardening labours. Jones also offered his services as a photographer to other gardeners. He married in 1894. By 1910 he and his family moved to Lincolnshire, where he died on 15 November 1959, aged ninety-two. Photographic work The photographs were probably made between 1895 and 1910, and likely while he was employed at Ote Hall. Jones' work was never exhibited in his lifetime, and was largely unknown even to his family, until the photographic prints were discovered by accident in 1981. Sean Sexton found a suitcase containing hundreds of prints of vegetables, fruits and flowers at Bermondsey antiques market. None of the glass-plate negatives have been located.

In 2010, Playboy magazine published an article by Hillel Levin in which Files also implicated Charles Nicoletti and John Roselli in the assassination of Kennedy. Background The wooden fence on the grassy knoll, where Files claims to have made his shot. Files has stated that he was born in Alabama, moved to California with his family shortly thereafter, then to an Italian neighborhood in Chicago. On May 7, 1991, Files and his friend, David Morley, were involved in a roadside shootout in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, with two police officers, Detective David Ostertag and his partner, Gary Bitler. Ostertag and Bitler tried to apprehend the two for driving a stolen vehicle. During the shootout, Morley shot Detective Ostertag in the chest. Both Files and Morley shot at Detective Bitler but missed. Files and Morley then fled on foot but were arrested a few hours later. Files was charged with two counts of attempted murder and one count each of discharge of a firearm, aggravated battery with a firearm and armed violence. In August 1991, a jury found Files guilty of two counts of attempted murder. He was sentenced to 30 years for the shooting of Detective Ostertag and 20 years for attempting to shoot Detective Bitler. Files was initially imprisoned at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois before being transferred to Danville Correctional Center in Danville, Illinois. Files was paroled in May 2016. An \\"anonymous FBI source\\", later identified as Zack Shelton, has been reported by some researchers as having told Joe West, a private investigator in Houston, in the early 1990s about an inmate in an Illinois penitentiary who might have information about the Kennedy assassination. On August 17, 1992, West interviewed Files at Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois. After West's death in 1993, his family requested that his friend, Houston television producer Bob Vernon, take over the records concerning the story. Vernon is the owner of a bullet casing with teeth marks on it, even though it was not found until 1987. Critical analysis Vincent Bugliosi, author of Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, has characterized Files as \\"the Rodney Dangerfield of Kennedy assassins.\\" According to Bugliosi, very few within the majority of Americans (75%) who believe there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy respect him or his story. However, psychology professor Jerome Kroth described Files as \\"surprisingly credible\\" and said his story \\"is the most believable and persuasive\\" about the assassination.

There are seven main installments of video games and various media spin-offs, including music albums and a series of manga books. Originally released as an arcade game, Soul Edge, in 1995 and later ported to video game consoles, more recent versions have been released for consoles only and have evolved to include online playing modes. The central motif of the series, set in a historical fantasy version of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, are mythical swords, the evil weapon called Soul Edge and the subsequent sword used to oppose this evil, Soul Calibur (parsed as two words, while the game's title is written as a single word). While it has developed during its various iterations, some of the characters and gameplay elements have remained consistent throughout the series. Project Soul is the internal Namco development group responsible for the Soulcalibur franchise after the release of Soulcalibur II. Although the games are usually credited to Namco itself, the team established its name to draw attention to the group's combined accomplishments.Project Soul . IGN. Retrieved on 2008-12-10  Games  All games in the series before Soulcalibur III were originally released as arcade games, and subsequently ported to home consoles. The ported versions are known for their extra features, including characters, weapons, costumes, art galleries, martial arts demonstrations and involved single-player modes, when compared to the original arcade versions. For example, Seung Han Myong (Romanized in later games as Seong Han-myeong) is not featured in the arcade version of Soul Edge and in home versions there is an role-playing-type mode titled \\"Edge Master\\" where the player can unlock various items including weapons for the default characters.  Main series   Soul Edge  The first installment was titled Soul Edge in the arcades, and was updated to Soul Edge Ver. II and released outside Japan as Soul Blade on PlayStation hardware. Set in the late sixteenth century, the game follows nine warriors in a quest, each of whom has their own reasons for joining the quest but they all share a common goal: to obtain the legendary sword, called 'Soul Edge'. After appearing in arcades, the game was made available for PlayStation in 1996. Along with its soundtrack, it has been praised for being innovative yet traditional to the fighting genre of games. With Versus (one-on-one battle mode), Survival (take on a gauntlet of opponents until the player is unable to continue), Time Attack, Team Battle (a selection of combatants will take on an opposing group, a victor is announced when the last remaining member of a team is defeated) and Training modes, the console port also saw the addition of Edge Master, a single-player mode in which the player would guide one of the ten main characters in a story-like manner while obtaining a variety of weapons for use.  Soulcalibur  The sequel to Soul Edge was released for arcade a year later, with a port for the Dreamcast in 1999. The plot is set two‚Äìthree years after the first game. The title is derived from Soul Calibur, a legendary weapon which opposes the evil of Soul Edge. Soul Calibur is also known as Soul Blade as an updated version which released on the Sega Dreamcast. Though retaining elements of its predecessor, Soulcalibur incorporated an extensive number of new features, including the \\"8-Way Run\\". The title Soulcalibur became a trademark title to be used throughout the series since. In 2008, Namco Bandai released Soulcalibur on the Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. Although online leaderboards and achievements were supported in this version, there was no online playing mode or mission mode, as there was in the Dreamcast version.  Soulcalibur II  2002's Soulcalibur II further improved and expanded on the Soulcalibur original, in both graphics and gameplay. Soulcalibur II was released in arcade format three years after the previous release in the series, and was subsequently ported to all three active sixth-generation consoles. This is the first game in the Soulcalibur series to feature characters in other media, such as Link from Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda, playable on the GameCube. Featured on the PlayStation 2 version's roster is Heihachi Mishima of Tekken, while Image Comic's character Spawn was an addition for the Xbox version. A high definition-optimized enhanced port of the game, entitled Soulcalibur II HD Online, was released in November 2013, and features revamped HD visuals, online play, and trophy/achievement support. It is a digital release and is available through Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and Sony's PlayStation Network digital storefronts. Being based on the original PlayStation 2 and Xbox releases, both ports include the two guest characters (Heihachi Mishima and Spawn) who were originally exclusive to each platform.  Soulcalibur III  Breaking with tradition, the PlayStation 2 version of Soulcalibur III was released in 2005 before an Arcade Edition was seen. It used a different graphics engine. Soulcalibur III contains a new single-player mode called \\"Tales of Souls\\", a story mode in which the player can make course-altering decisions. Arenas are more interactive, for example with rocks breaking if a character were to impact against them. Soulcalibur III is the first game in the series to feature a character creation system, and features a story mode called \\"Chronicles of the Sword\\" which is a mode with some strategic aspects for created characters. It is the only game in the Soulcalibur series to be THX approved.THX Certified Game Titles . THX. Retrieved on 2008-12-10  Soulcalibur IV  Released in 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the fourth installment of the series is the second game with no arcade release prior to the release of the home game, as well as being the first to take bouts online and the last game to conclude the 1590 A.D. trilogy. Soulcalibur IV introduces new gameplay mechanics into the series in the form of damage- absorbing armor (that can be shattered) and Critical Finishes (both tied to the new Soul Gauge). Like Soulcalibur II, the fourth game also included cameos from different media. The Star Wars character Darth Vader is a playable character on the PlayStation 3 version, while Yoda is for the Xbox 360 version. Each character is also available for download on the consoles in which they do not appear. Both versions of the game include the Apprentice character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. Like Soulcalibur III, the game includes a character creation system with various customizable parts, some of which have to be unlocked. These characters can be taken into online bouts, which in itself is a new addition to the series. However, unlike Soulcalibur III, the only available weapon disciplines are taken from the existing roster and there are no unique disciplines for created characters.  Soulcalibur V  Released in 2012 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Soulcalibur V is the sixth installment of the series and the second game to take bouts online, as well as the last installment to conclude the original timeline story. Like the other Soulcalibur series, this game features guest characters; in this case Ezio Auditore da Firenze from the Assassin's Creed series and as well as the fighting style of Devil Jin from the Tekken series.  Soulcalibur VI  Soulcalibur VI at PAX West 2018 Soulcalibur VI was released in 2018, originally act as a soft reboot, taking the series back to mostly reimagined after Soul Edge. Like Tekken 7, it uses Unreal Engine 4, and features downloadable guests, while one guest character (Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher series) acts as one of the base roster and plays vital role on the storyline.  Spin-offs   Soulcalibur Legends  Released in 2007 for the Wii, Soulcalibur Legends is the series' first spin-off title. Departing from the usual fighting game genre, it is an action-adventure game with elements of hack and slash, in which the player controls one out of the game's seven playable characters through a level infested with enemies and defeats the boss in the end. It features competitive and cooperative gameplay in addition to the single-player mode. Soulcalibur Legends, although set between the events of Soul Edge and Soulcalibur, is non-canon to the series.  Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny  Released in 2009 for the Sony PSP, Soulcalibur: Broken Destiny is the first portable installment of the Soulcalibur series. It uses many of the features used in Soulcalibur IV, such as the soul crush, armor destruction, critical finishers, and Character Creation, and also brings in some new features such as new lighting effects for stages that correspond to different times of day, and the new Gauntlet Story mode. The game's features are similar to Soulcalibur IV, including its customization features, but it introduced a new character named Dampierre, a conman who wears twin blades on his wrists. In addition, Kratos from the God of War franchise appears as a guest character. Broken Destiny received very positive reviews.  Soulcalibur: Lost Swords  Released in 2014, Soulcalibur: Lost Swords is a free-to-play video game distributed through the PlayStation Network. It is a strictly single-player game based on Soulcalibur V which goal is for the player to collect loot, including raw materials and weapons, through battles in the new Quest Mode.  Soulcalibur: Unbreakable Soul  Initially trademarked by Bandai Namco in October 2013, Soulcalibur: Unbreakable Soul was announced on Bandai Namco's Global Gamer's Day 2014 for the mobile phones, the first installment made specifically for the platform, this time iOS (the previous mobile game was an Android port of Soulcalibur). Released on May 8, 2014, Unbreakable Soul is a card-based fighting game where players can pick different attack cards to strike enemies. Elemental system makes a return from Soulcalibur: Lost Swords; players can mix the cards with one of the five elements: fire, water, wind, light, and dark. There are over 200 weapons as well as more than 150 player avatars featured. The game's story revolves around Cassandra and Edge Master in their efforts to find the fragments of Soul Edge. Unbreakable Soul received unfavorable reviews.  Gameplay  All the games in the Soulcalibur series retain some specific features while others features vary from game to game. The basic button layout for the series launches two weapon attacks (horizontally and vertically aligned strikes), a kick button, and a guard button for blocking. Two features that have been kept in the series since its inception are the Guard Impact defense system and the Ring Out condition of victory. In the first game (Soul Edge/Blade), the Guard Impact system is a repelling technique that allows the player to check an incoming strike and push it back to allow a free hit. A Guard Impact requires precise timing (with the player pressing forward and guarding at the instant an opponent strikes) but it results in tactical advantage for the defender. The opposing player is able to counter a Guard Impact with their own and this can result in a stalemate until one of the players misjudges the timing on a subsequent Guard Impact. As the series progressed, the Guard Impact system was developed further. In Soulcalibur, Namco introduced new Guard Impact techniques: Parry and Weapon Strip, while the original repelling technique was renamed as Repelling. These different Guard Impact types have been kept in subsequent installments of the game. In the fifth game, Guard Impacts were slightly altered by giving the Parry maneuver the new property of slamming opponents to the ground rather than just easing their weapon off course. Repels still work in the same way as they have in previous Soulcalibur series games. Ring Outs occur when one of the fighters is forcibly removed from the game's arena (or ring), instantly ending the round and resulting in a round point for their opponent. The idea of Ring Outs in 3D fighting games was originally conceived by the Virtua Fighter series of fighting games and adopted by Namco for Soul Edge. A combatant cannot be knocked out of the ring without being eliminated by some effort from themselves or by their opponent. Later games introduced new ring designs that modified the way Ring Outs were handled (Soulcalibur allowed rings to take different shapes instead of a basic square, Soulcalibur II introduced stages with walls that blocked off parts of the ring and made Ring Outs possible only in certain parts of the stage or removing that condition altogether, and Soulcalibur III introduced low walls that can be destroyed to create a Ring Out opportunity). Soulcalibur V introduced a new aspect of Ring Outs; if a Ring Out is declared on certain stages, the battle will continue in a new location that is below the point where the Ring Out occurred. V also includes infinite stages (the stages have no edges of any kind, allowing the battle to continue in any direction with no limit) for the first time in the history of the series. Soul Edge is unique in the series as it is the only game to feature the Weapon Meter; a sword-shaped meter under the characters' vitality bars that determined how much damage a weapon could sustain. As a character blocked attacks; the meter would deplete until it emptied which resulted in a weapon breaking (the player would also have to pay half the Weapon Meter to perform a Critical Edge combo). Once the character's weapon was broken, they were forced to fight bare-handed until the end of the round. The Weapon Meter was designed to promote consistent offense and deter constant defense (other fighters have adopted similar means to deter over-defending; Street Fighter Alpha 3s Guard Meter is an example of such a device). The Weapon Meter was abandoned following Soul Edge and instead replaced with Soulcaliburs trademark 8-Way Run system. The 8-Way Run allowed players to walk in any direction at any time instead of using a specific command to sidestep. This kept the fights truly three-dimensional and made it easier to maneuver around attacks or away from ring edges (as well as launch specific 8-Way Run attacks). Each of the sequels to Soulcalibur has used the 8-Way Run movement system. In Soulcalibur IV, Namco introduced a new variation of the Critical Edge combo, called the Critical Finish. Rather than being a combo, a Critical Finish is more of a finishing move which involves an elaborate move that defeats opponents in a single attack. This new attack is tied to the Soul Gauge that works similarly to the Guard Break meter in Street Fighter Alpha 3 (the meter decreases whenever the player blocks an attack and is replenished by landing attacks on the opponent, it also refills slowly over time). Also tied to the Soul Gauge is the concept of destructible character armor (akin to Fighting Vipers) that can be smashed off characters to weaken their resistance to attacks. The Critical Finish itself replaces the Soul Charge from the other three Soulcalibur games (a supercharge-like move that can give a character counter properties for the duration of its charge). Large gameplay changes have been implemented for Soulcalibur V. Critical Finishes are no longer part of the gameplay, being replaced by the Critical Edge (a different attack from that used in Soul Blade). Critical Edge attacks can be used after filling up the new Critical Gauge, which works similarly to \\"super meters\\" in other fighting games. Guard Impacts are now tied to this gauge (a segment must be sacrificed to execute one) and the original Guard Impact mechanic is replaced by Just Guard, which works similarly but removes the consequence for missed timing. The Critical Gauge can also be used for Brave Edge attacks, which are stronger attacks than regular ones that don't require an entire bar. In addition to the 8-Way Run, Quick Step allows players to execute a faster sidestep to circle their opponent.  Plot  A long time ago, an ordinary sword was soaked with blood through the endless battles of its era, causing the sword to be corrupted and becoming sentient by its own, which earned it the name \\"Soul Edge\\". No one dared to wield the sword without getting corrupted by its evil spirit, and only the Hero King, Algol can wield it without getting possessed. However, Algol's son, jealous of his father's feat, wielded the sword and became corrupted. Algol destroyed both his son and the sword, from which he then made a weapon in grief, naming it \\"Soul Calibur\\". He was sacrificed to complete the sword's ritual which would then be protected by a cult; no one knew that Soul Edge would reform on its own later on. Soul Calibur itself was lost after it was stolen by a member of the cult, Zasalamel. In 1553, a Spanish pirate, Cervantes de Leon stole Soul Edge from a dealer's ship, but gradually became corrupted by its spirit until it devoured his soul, influencing him to terrorize the world for over twenty years. This terror made several warriors to venture out and stop him, including a female ninja, Taki, who wanted to destroy Soul Edge for having corrupted her master, and a German rebel, Siegfried Schtauffen, who desperately wanted to blame someone for the accidental murder of his father. Eventually, a Greek warrior, Sophitia Alexandra, confronted and managed to destroy one of Cervantes' blades, but the battle was eventually ended by Taki, who managed to slay Cervantes. Siegfried then came to check Soul Edge, but he became possessed by the release of the \\"Evil Seed\\" and turned into the monstrous Nightmare. The Evil Seed event had major impact to the world, including several people going insane, and Nightmare replaced Cervantes in terrorizing the world, wanting to recover the lost Soul Edge fragments. Three years later, Nightmare had prepared for the ritual to complete Soul Edge, but three warriors from Asia, Chai Xianghua, Kilik, and Maxi stormed his castle, the Ostrheinsburg and managed to defeat Nightmare, with Soul Edge's spirit (Inferno) being shattered by Xianghua's blade, which was revealed to be the lost Soul Calibur. Though Siegfried temporarily regained his sanity, he became possessed again shortly after, as did Soul Calibur, which succumbed to the darkness of Inferno. Four years later, Nightmare had begun on his Soul Edge ritual again in his old castle, wanting to resurrect Soul Edge, but his ritual was interrupted by an exiled French nobleman, Raphael Sorel. Although Raphael was utterly defeated, he was able to penetrate Soul Edge, which gave Siegfried and Soul Calibur the time to break free of its control fully. Soul Edge was then pierced by Siegfried using Soul Calibur, trapping them in the \\"Soul Embrace\\". While things seemed to go normal afterwards, Zasalamel had returned to try and free both swords, intending to use their power to break his cycle of reincarnation induced by Soul Calibur. He managed to do so, and Inferno took a physical form to become the \\"second Nightmare\\". Siegfried clashed with this new Nightmare, but was wounded in the process and had to be healed by Soul Calibur, tying him with it permanently, while Soul Edge was cast to the void to heal itself. The clash of Soul Edge and Soul Calibur had awakened Algol from his slumber, who rose the Tower of Remembrance to wait for warriors to challenge him. Meanwhile, Nightmare, with his servant Tira, wanting to gather the Soul Edge fragments to complete Soul Edge, forced several warriors, including Astaroth, Sophitia, and Voldo into servitude, while Siegfried, having recovered, set out to confront Nightmare. The two clashed for the second time in the Tower of Remembrance, where Siegfried managed to destroy both Nightmare and Soul Edge, seemingly once and for all. Seventeen years later, however, Soul Edge had reformed itself, as did Nightmare, who had possessed a swordsman and became the king of Hungary under the alias \\"Graf Dumas\\". His former servant, Tira, did not accept him and intended to search for a new vessel for Soul Edge. She eventually found her now-dead nemesis, Sophitia's daughter, Pyrrha Alexandra, whom she had once kidnapped to blackmail Sophitia, who had Soul Edge's power in her blood. Though successful in advising her to attack and kill the people who had ostracized her, Tira was confronted by Pyrrha's long-lost brother, Patroklos Alexander, formerly a warrior under Graf Dumas, who had made his life's goal to find his sister and avenge his mother's murder. While he was able to bring her back, they were confronted by Nightmare and Pyrrha awakened her Soul Edge powers. She was disappointed when Patroklos was hesitant in accepting her, and decided to follow Tira again. Patroklos was named as Soul Calibur's new wielder afterwards by Siegfried and also purified the holy sword through the help of several Asian warriors, before going on an all-out battle in Europe. Nightmare was eventually killed by Siegfried's subordinate, Z.W.E.I., who was immediately wounded by the possessed Pyrrha, who proceeded to battle Patroklos. Patroklos accidentally killed his sister, but was given a second chance by Edge Master to purify Pyrrha without killing her. However, Patroklos was trapped subconsciously to fight Soul Calibur's spirit, Elysium, the one who had guided him all this time, as she was angry at him for sparing his malfested sister. After defeating Elysium, he alongside Pyrrha pierced Soul Calibur with Soul Edge, after which he accepted to live with his sister regardless of who she is. In a parallel timeline, the events after 1583 have been altered. While traveling to Ostrheinsburg to confront Nightmare, Kilik and his companions were aided by Gr√∏h of the Aval Organization, a group created by the late King Arthur to use Soul Calibur to defeat Soul Edge. A few characters have learned of the dark future that was to come, and have started to work on changing that future. Zasalamel received a warning from his future counterpart of the mistakes that he would make, and decided to be a leader for mankind instead of seeking for a permanent death. Cassandra Alexandra, younger sister of the holy warrior Sophitia, was given a warning by her original timeline counterpart, who had been stuck inside the Astral Chaos and became malfested. The warning was about Sophitia's death and Pyrrha's malfestation in the future, and the new Cassandra set off to prevent the tragic fate of her family. Meanwhile, Azwel, who had been a member of the Aval Organization but betrayed them, set about to create the ‚ÄúUltimate Seed,‚Äù which was similar to the original Evil Seed. But his plans were thwarted by the Conduit, a warrior who had the power to absorb astral fissures and who was aided by Gr√∏h. But the Conduit later had to fight Gr√∏h, who had succumbed to his malfestation. The Conduit will either kill or spare Gr√∏h, depending on their actions from their journey.  Characters  Models dressed as Taki, Talim, Sophitia and Siegfried from Soulcalibur VI at PAX West 2018 The Soul series features a wide variety of characters hailing from various regions, backgrounds, and disciplines. Most characters typically have their own reasons in partaking their journey, although they frequently meet and interact with each other and most also share a common goal; finding either the cursed sword Soul Edge or its holy counterpart, Soul Calibur. As the game is set in the late 16th century, many real-life events happening during the timeline often influence the story, one example being Oda Nobunaga as the initiator for Yoshimitsu's journey to find Soul Edge. Out of all the characters in the series, four characters have appeared in all nine games so far: Cervantes, Mitsurugi, Siegfried and Nightmare, the latter two making one appearance each as an alternate costume to each other. Four characters: Astaroth, Ivy, Sophitia, and Taki have come close, appearing in eight games. Other characters who do not appear often make cameos or being commented upon in-game. While continuously being revised in each game, the character lineup generally stay consistent until Soulcalibur V, in which a major time skip is done and the character roster undergoing major changes, with former mainstays being replaced by their younger successors. The series is notable for its inclusion of characters from other series appearing as guests. Since Soulcalibur II, every sequent game have hosted guest characters, usually from other Namco franchises, although more recent games have branched into titles developed by other companies, such as The Legend of Zelda, Spawn, Star Wars, God of War, Assassin's Creed and The Witcher. The guests, though, can only appear in one game due to licensing. Guest characters who have appeared in the series include Heihachi Mishima, Devil Jin, King, Ling Xiaoyu, Asuka Kazama, and Jun Kazama from Tekken (the latter five as attires for custom characters), Link from The Legend of Zelda, Spawn from Spawn, Lloyd Irving from Tales of Symphonia, KOS-MOS from Xenosaga (as an attire for custom characters), Darth Vader, Yoda, and The Apprentice from Star Wars, Kratos from God of War, Ezio Auditore da Firenze from Assassin's Creed, Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher, and 2B from NieR: Automata. Other than featuring characters from other series, the series' characters have also appeared in other video games as well, including the Ridge Racer series, Pac-Man Fever, Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2, Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos, Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate, as well as crossover titles such as Namco √ó Capcom and Project X Zone 2.  Other media   Books  A five-volume manga based on Soulcalibur was published in 1999. A two-volume novelization was written by Tobita Mandom (supervised by Project Soul), illustrated by JUNNY, and published by Shueisha in Japan in 2012. Several guide and art books were published in Japan for various installments of the series by Namco, Enterbrain, Gamest, Nintendo and V Jump.

The school is located in Cottleville, Missouri, but a large part of its student population comes from its larger neighbor St. Peters. Home of the Spartans, Francis Howell Central is a four- year comprehensive high school offering programs in college preparatory, vocational, honors/advanced credit, advanced placement and a special education program. History FHC opened in the fall of 1997 with only freshmen and sophomore students. The school had been built in a series of phases; much of what is visible today had not yet been constructed at the time of its opening. The school's first principal was Don Muench. The building opened with relatively few teachers, due to low student enrollment at the time. Eventually the school expanded to include junior and senior grades as well. In 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court upheld a law that allowed students attending unaccredited school districts to transfer to other schools. A lawful decision was made that students from a neighboring county's failing Normandy District, which was predominately black, would attend the majority white Francis Howell School District. This led to Francis Howell district parents voicing concerns against the transfer of students even though they would pay out-of-district tuition. The town hall meeting went on for over two hours with almost 3,000 people in attendance. One parent at Francis Howell Central High School stated : \\"I deserve to not have to worry about my children getting stabbed, or taking a drug, or getting robbed\\" which was supported by many cheers. Many of these parents were later criticized by some as racist and classist. Other parents drew similarities between their current controversy and that of desegregation busing during the Civil Rights Movement. In 2014, the Francis Howell School District decided to no longer take out-of-district tuition and the Missouri State Board of Education to reconstitute the Normandy District as the Normandy Schools Collaborative and eliminate its \\"unaccredited\\" status.

He was elected in November 2006 after his opponent, six-term Republican incumbent Mark Foley, resigned on September 29, 2006, after questions were raised about an email exchange with a congressional page. In October 2008, media outlets began reporting allegations that Mahoney paid hush money to a mistress to conceal an extramarital affair. Tim Mahoney ran for reelection in 2008 but lost the November 4 election to Republican Tom Rooney. Early life and career Mahoney was born in Aurora, Illinois. He grew up in Summit, New Jersey, and graduated from Summit High School in 1974.Farrington, Brenda via Associated Press. \\"Foley Scandal Puts Spotlight On Underdog House Hopeful\\", The Ledger, October 4, 2006.

He moved to Florida 18 years ago and has a wife, Terry, and 20-year-old daughter, Bailey.\\" He obtained a bachelor's degree in computer science and business from West Virginia University in 1978 and an M.B.A. from George Washington University in 1983. Mahoney began his career in the computer business. After seven years, he achieved wealth when a company he was working for, Tecmar, which sold personal computer accessories, was sold. In 1986, he moved to Florida and became president of Rodime Systems, a division of Rodime Inc. Rodime Inc., for which Mahoney was also vice president of marketing and sales, manufactured disc drives that were packaged for the retail market by Rodime Systems. In 1995, Mahoney and business partner, Lenny Sokolow, started Union Atlantic, LLC, a venture capital firm. His inability to get the firm listed on vFinance.com, a fledgling matchmaking Web site for venture capitalists and cash-hungry entrepreneurs, led him and Sokolow to purchase the website in 1998, merging it with Union Atlantic. Mahoney served as chairman and chief operating officer of vFinance, Inc., a financial services company which is located in Boca Raton. vFinance initially grew quickly after buying several other broker-dealer and financial services customers, and during his last year with the company reported revenues in excess of $38 million. Sokolow replaced Mahoney as chairman and COO in 2007.  U.S. Congress  Mahoney had been a Republican for most of his life, but became a Democrat in the summer of 2005 after having allegedly becoming disillusioned by the GOP. 2006 campaign In the 2006 general election, Mahoney faced six-term Republican incumbent Mark Foley. In a twist of history, Foley had been a Democrat for most of his life before switching parties to run for Congress. In 2006, 42% of the voters in this district were registered Republicans, and 36% were registered Democrats. George W. Bush won this district with 52% of the vote in the 2000 presidential election, and with 54% of the vote in the 2004 presidential election. One poll taken by Hamilton Beattie on September 12, 2006, had Foley leading Mahoney 48% to 35%.http://www.pollingreport.com/sub/2006fl1.htm#16th In the campaign, Mahoney sharply criticized the Bush administration for overspending, general mismanagement, and its policies in Iraq. In August, General Wesley Clark endorsed Mahoney. On September 28, 2006, ABC News reported that Foley had sent email messages, from his personal AOL account, to a then-16-year-old former congressional page, asking the page to send a photo of himself to Foley, among other things that were overtly sexual in nature. After the Republican leadership told Foley that he would face almost certain expulsion from the House, Foley resigned the next day. The Republicans' hold on the seat went from \\"safe\\" to \\"shaky\\" overnight.https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060930/ap_on_el_ho/congressman_e_mails_florida On October 2, 2006, the Florida Republican Party Executive Board selected state Representative Joe Negron as Mahoney's new opponent. However, Negron's name did not appear on the ballot; he only received votes cast for Foley, whose name remained on the ballot by law. On election day, Mahoney narrowly defeated Negron by 1.8 percentage points.Florida Department of State - Election Results While Negron carried most of the more conservative areas of the district near Fort Myers, Mahoney carried the two largest counties in the district, Palm Beach and St. Lucie counties, by a combined margin of over 10,000 votes ‚Äî far more than the actual margin of victory. Mahoney was the first Democrat to represent the district since its creation in 1973 (it was numbered as the 10th district from 1973 to 1983, and as the 12th district from 1983 to 1993). 2008 election Mahoney had been a top target for defeat in 2008, due to the district's Republican voting history. In addition, revelations of his extramarital affair (see below) severely hampered his reelection chances. In the November election, Mahoney was soundly defeated by former assistant state Attorney General Tom Rooney. Mahoney won only 40 percent of the vote to Rooney's 60 percent ‚Äî the largest margin of defeat for an incumbent in the 2008 cycle. Issues and positions Mahoney was generally considered to be a moderate Democrat, especially by South Florida Democratic standards. He has taken the following policy stances: * Homeland Security: Supports screening of all cargo containers entering American ports, and increased funding for first responders. * Immigration: Supports increased border security. * Seniors: Opposed to Social Security Privatization. Supports reforming Medicare‚Äôs Part D Prescription Drug Program. * Environment: Advocate of preserving Florida Everglades from unregulated development. Supports Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project. * Insurance: Supports guaranteed disaster insurance for high-risk areas. Advocate of national catastrophic fund on Financial Services Committee. * Supported the Farm, Nutrition and Bioenergy Act of 2007. He is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of Democratic congressmen (largely from the South) known for moderate to conservative stances, especially on fiscal issues. On September 29, 2008, Mahoney voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Retrieved on September 29, 2008. Committee assignments *Committee on Financial Services **Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises **Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit *Committee on Agriculture **Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture **Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry  Personal life  Mahoney has a home in Palm Beach Gardens (though he was described in the official House roll as \\"D-Venus\\") and a cattle ranch in southern Highlands County. He is divorced and has a daughter. Mahoney, a Methodist, describes himself as a \\"fundamental Christian\\".  Controversies   Residency scandal  On September 18, 2008, the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call ran an article questioning Mahoney's residency status. It alleged that Mahoney had registered to vote at \\"a horse barn\\" for the purposes of having residency in his congressional district, while his primary residence was actually in another district. The issue came to light after Mahoney missed a rent payment on his Capitol Hill apartment in July 2007. The case itself was dismissed on September 6, 2007. While Mahoney's opponent, Tom Rooney, attempted to make light of the allegations, the attack proved ineffective after Democrats revealed that Rooney himself was registered to vote at a dog track. While members of the House are only required to live in the state they wish to represent, it has become a strong convention that they live in or near the district they represent as well.  Sex scandals  On October 13, 2008, ABC News reported that Mahoney had agreed to a $121,000 payment to a former mistress who worked on his staff and was threatening to sue him. Because Mahoney won this seat in 2006 after a sex scandal forced the incumbent to resign, several considered it ironic that a sex scandal of his own coming to light a month before the election, especially since he first campaigned against such corruption. Some professional political pundits, such as Charlie Cook, reclassified the race as \\"Leans Republican.\\" The FBI looked into whether Mahoney hired the first mistress ‚Äî and put her on the federal payroll ‚Äî so she would not reveal their affair. Mahoney admitted to having \\"numerous\\" affairs, \\"certainly more than two.\\" Mahoney's wife Terry filed for divorce in Palm Beach County court on October 20, 2008.  2011 arrest  On August 6, 2011, Mahoney was booked into the Palm Beach County jail and charged with a DUI offense.

The institute has provinces or delegations in Italy, the Philippines, the United States, M√©xico, Per√∫, Brazil, Bolivia, India, Poland, and Nigeria. The congregation also has members present in Australia and Indonesia. Professed members of the Oblates of St. Joseph use the post-nominal letters \\"O.S.J.,\\" which corresponds to the Latin title of the institute. Oblates of St. Joseph, San Jose, Batangas History Joseph Marello's original intent was to found a simple association of men dedicated to a common spirituality, serving the local church in catechesis and assisting local clergy but not publicly professing canonical vows in a religious institute. On March 14, 1878, he opened a house for what he called the \\"Company of St. Joseph\\" and invited four candidates to be members. By 1883, the Company had begun accepting candidates for the priesthood along with candidates to be lay brothers. Eventually the Company of St. Joseph would become known as the Oblates of St. Joseph. On September 15, 1921, the Oblates of St. Joseph received approval as an international institute of pontifical status. Spirituality Apostolates and Ministries The principal apostolate of the Oblates of St. Joseph is to work with youth and the poor. However, Joseph Marello's original plan was to have the Oblates serve in whatever capacity the local bishop deemed necessary, so long as it was consistent with the spirituality and life of the Oblates. In the present day, the Oblates serve in many different capacities, depending upon the needs of the bishops where they serve. Common apostolates include education and catechesis of youth, parish ministry, serving the poor and underprivileged, and orphanages. Organization The Oblates of St. Joseph are headed by the Superior General and the General Council, composed of four councilors. Geographic regions are organized into Provinces and Delegations, each of which is headed by a Provincial or Delegate, respectively. The Superior General and his council serve for a six-year term; Provincials and Delegates serve for three year terms. Each community has a superior (the Rector) who serves a three-year term. Oblates of St. Joseph are bound by their Rule to live in community, unless exceptional permission is granted.

Westport is a majority African-American neighborhood that has struggled with crime, housing abandonment, and unemployment in the past decade. The neighborhood is bordered by the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River on the east, the city neighborhoods of Cherry Hill, Brooklyn and the southwestern Baltimore County community of Lansdowne to the southwest, Hollins Ferry Road and the Mount Winans and Lakeland neighborhoods to the west, and Interstate 95 to the north, along with the South Baltimore communities of Federal Hill and Otterbein. The Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway (Maryland Route 295 ‚Äî formerly Interstate 295) runs through the middle of Westport and intersects with Interstate 95, the main East Coast super-highway, north to south, Maine to Florida. History The neighborhood is mostly brick row homes built in the 1920s with small front porches of the \\"Daylight\\" style. The neighborhood consisted of mostly blue- collar workers who worked at nearby businesses which faced the waterfront of the Middle Branch (formerly known as \\"Ferry Branch\\" of the Patapsco River in the 19th century and in the colonial era as \\"Ridgley's Cove\\" and adjacent Smith's Cove) of the modern Baltimore Harbor and Port and Patapsco River such as the Carr Lowrey Glass Company and the Constellation Energy's Baltimore Gas and Electric Company's Westport Generating Plant. A railroad bridge trestle for the old Western Maryland Railway and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad leading east to their Locust Point facilities for the B. & O. and to Port Covington for the W.M.Ry. terminals in South Baltimore crossed the Middle Branch and runs east and west through the Westport community. Over the years, the industrial core of Baltimore faded and many residents moved to the suburbs, leaving neighborhoods like Westport and nearby Mount Winans, Lakeland and southwest Baltimore to fall into disrepair. Despite a concrete re-paving of the main commercial street of Old Annapolis Road and a planting of rows of new shade trees and new sidewalks & curbing in the early 1970s, by the later decade, numerous businesses, branch banks and other stores and shops closed along the commercial/residential strip, including a branch library of the Enoch Pratt Free Library at Old Annapolis and Waterview Avenue. According to an article from the Baltimore Department of Planning, by 2000, 22% of the homes in Westport were abandoned. When the long-time industrial leader in its field, the Carr Lowrey Glass Company closed and went out of business, the property was purchased by Inner Harbor West LLC for $6.82 million. The prior year, Inner Harbor West LLC had also purchased the old Baltimore Gas & Electric Company's 1920s era power plant from its holding company, Constellation Energy Group. The Carr Lowrey factory was leveled along with demolition of the substantial huge obsolete heavy-polluting coal-fired power plant and there were plans for waterfront development with a waterfront park and promenade access, though now stalled by 2019. Westport has a picturesque view to the east of the concrete arched spans of the 1914‚Äì1917 historic Hanover Street Bridge and the Baltimore downtown skyline along the Inner Harbor to the northeast. As a result of the potential development and newly recognized new waterfront viability with access reopened, housing prices among the 1910s and 20s era rows of older rowhouses on the few Westport streets rose significantly in anticipation of the neighborhood becoming \\"the Next Canton\\". Four decades earlier in 1985, the Wheelabrator Incinerator, a waste-to-energy plant, was built further north of the neighborhood along the mouth/outlet of the Gwynns Falls stream on the northwestern shore of the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River harbor in Westport, near Interstate 95. The tall white smokestack that reads \\"Baltimore\\" in capital letters, is considered a distinctive landmark for motorists traveling on I-95. Here is the ending of the Gwynns Falls Trail, a hiking/biking path following the stream on its course through southwest, them west, then to northwestern city neighborhoods to Baltimore County beyond with interpretative signage along the path of its historical sites and environmental importance along the way in the picturesque stream valley and parks. In the spring of 2011, City officials gave the green light to major city developer, Patrick Turner for future development along its Middle Branch waterfront over the next ten years in phases. Westport was designated a \\"BRAC Zone\\" to attract major employers with many incentives, especially attracting contractors from both military installations at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Harford County, Maryland and Fort George G. Meade in northern Anne Arundel County (Baltimore Development Corporation). The first phase of development is expected to begin in late 2011 and during 2012, with a luxury apartment building being the first of many buildings. The rezoning bill for Westport's main drag on Annapolis Road went into effect on May 11, 2011, together with the Annapolis Road Urban Renewal Plan (URP), with hopes to add businesses in its existing neighborhood as the waterfront develops. Patrick Turner himself, the City and its now very active and rejuvenated Westport Neighborhood Association had a lot to do with the hopeful neighborhood improvements. Up until the recession that eventually landed Turner in US bankruptcy court, Patrick was committed to improving the urban landscape in Westport and its surrounding neighborhoods, Cherry Hill, Mt. Winans and Lakeland. But due to the aforementioned bankruptcy, those dreams were squashed, leaving the 43-acre parcel of land undeveloped. There were a number of community leaders involved in Patrick Turner's Westport Waterfront Development Project, including Ben Stone (Formerly of the Baltimore Development Corporation), Michael Middleton (Executive Director of Cherry Hill Development Corporation), Janette Wheeler, RN (President & CEO of Mt. Winans Community Development Corporation), Ruth Sherill (Former President of Westport Neighborhood Association), Linda Towe (Executive Director of Project T.O.O.U.R.), Gregory L. Countess, Esq. (Legal Adviser), Kim Trueheart (Cherry Hill Development Corporation-Youth Partner). There was no representative for the Lakeland neighborhood. Collectively the group also worked on vapor intrusion stemming from a former industrial site, located next to a number of homes, demanding the state address the hazardous toxic vapors in Westport. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 2,185 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Westport was 9.8% White, 88.8% African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.5% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 0.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.9% of the population. 32.4% of occupied housing units were owner-occupied. 22.0% of housing units were vacant. The demographics of this neighborhood is expected to have a dramatic change with pending waterfront development within the next few years. 34.6% of the population were employed, 17.9% were unemployed, and 47.5% were not in the labor force. The median household income was $16,250. About 45.7% of families and 43.0% of the population were below the poverty line. Sports This neighborhood was the site of the old Westport Raceway - a stock car dirt track racing course during the 1930s - 1940s to mid 1950s along with adjacent Westport Stadium, a baseball grounds used by various Negro Leagues professional baseball teams, the Baltimore Black Sox in the 1920s and early 1930s, followed by the later Baltimore Elite Giants in the 1940s. Located near Old Annapolis Road (Maryland Route 648) and Waterview Avenue, until the routing and construction in the early 1950s which split the community of Westport for the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, (Interstate 295), going north into downtown from the southwest via Russell Street completed in 1954. Westport was also the \\"home town\\" neighborhood of Al Kaline, who played Maryland Scholastic Association (M.S.A.) high school competition in baseball and attending, later graduated from South Baltimore's Southern High School (now Digital Harbor High School two blocks further away to the southeast), near Federal Hill in old South Baltimore in June 1953 and was quickly scouted and recruited by the Detroit Tigers of the American League for the then-all- time high amount of signing bonus of $35,000.00. He began his major league career immediately that same month after graduating from S.H.S. without spending any time in the lower minor leagues. Al Kaline also had earlier attracted attention as he coached the Westport Methodist Baseball League. At that time, after two years of negotiations, local Baltimore businessmen led by attorney Clarence Miles with Baltimore City Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., made a deal with the American League team owners and had just purchased its St. Louis Browns franchise from controversial owner Bill Veeck in November 1953, and to move the team to Maryland becoming the renamed new Baltimore Orioles who played their first game in the city, in April 1954, coincidentally the following season after Baltimorean school sports star Kaline began play with the Tigers on Lake Michigan. Transportation Westport is served by Baltimore's north to south (Hunt Valley to BWI Airport and Glen Burnie) Light Rail system with the Westport Station.

He established the Naqshbandƒ´ suborder Mazhariyya Shamsiyya. Birth and early life The date of birth is variously given as 1111 or 1113 A.H, and it took place in KƒÅlƒÅ BƒÅgh, MƒÅlwa. Shaikh Muhammad Tahir Bakhshi notes his date of birth as 11th Ramadan 1111 AH. He was born into a noble family of Afghan extraction. His father MirzƒÅ JƒÅn was employed in the army of the mighty Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Following a custom according to which the Emperor had the right to name the sons of his officers, Aurangzeb is reported to have said:Medieval Muslim views of Indian religion, Y. Friedmann, JOAS 95, 1975. > \\"A son is the soul of his father. Since the name of his father is MirzƒÅ JƒÅn, > the name of the son will be JƒÅn-i JƒÅnƒÅn.\\" His early religious instruction was entrusted to hƒÅjjƒ´ Afzal SiyƒÅlk≈çtƒ´ (hadith) and hƒÅfiz Abd al-Ras≈´l Dihlawƒ´ (Qur'an). At the age of 18, he joined the Naqshbandƒ´ order under N≈´r Muhammad Bada'≈´ni, who was closely connected to the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindƒ´, and completed his studies in four years. He was also initiated in the QƒÅdirƒ´, Chishtƒ´ and Suhrawardƒ´ orders. In his prime, Mazhar was advised to write poetry in Urdu rather than Persian as the days of the latter language were said to be numbered in India. Besides authoring poetry and polemics, Mazhar also wrote a large number of letters relating to Sufi thought and practice. Legacy and influence Among his 'disciples' or Muridƒ´n was the great Hanafƒ´ scholar, QƒÅdƒ´ ThanƒÅullƒÅh Panipatƒ´, who wrote a famous Tafsir of the Qur'an by the name Tafsir-i Mazharƒ´, which he named after his teacher. Also in his spiritual lineage (silsila) came the great Hanafƒ´ jurist Imam Ibn 'Abidƒ´n and the Qur'an exegete AllƒÅma Alusƒ´. His Naqshbandƒ´ lineage came to be known as Mazhariyya Shamsiyya. Mazhar apparently authorised more disciples than any of his predecessors. He regularly corresponded with his deputies, and his letters form much of the basis of our knowledge about his life and ideas.The Naqshbandiyya: orthodoxy and activism in a worldwide Sufi tradition, Itzchak Weismann, Routledge, 2007. He was succeeded by his khalifa (deputy) Abdullah alias Shah Ghulam Ali Dahlavi, who is considered Mujaddid of the 13th Islamic century by most Naqshbandi followers today. His tariqah spread to whole India and Middle East. Death MirzƒÅ Mazhar was shot and seriously injured on the 7th of Muharram, of the year 1195 AH/1780 CE.

Pritchett Professor Friedmann, as well as Annemarie Schimmel and Itzchad Weismann, have all noted that MirzƒÅ Mazhar was killed by a Shi'ite zealot. Most of his Urdu biographers have also written that he was killed by a gunshot by a Shi'ite on 7th Muharram, and he died on 10th Muharram 1195 AH.Jalwa Gah-e-Dost (Urdu) 2nd edition (2008) by Muhammad Tahir Bakhshi Naqshbandi: Spiritual Chain of Succession Mirza Mazhar belonged to the Mujaddidi order of Sufism, which is the main branch of Naqshbandi Sufi tariqah.

Instead of providing short-term aid, World Neighbors creates permanent change by working alongside villagers, helping them to identify and solve their own problems, such as hunger, poverty, disease and other challenges that undermine their livelihoods. Currently, World Neighbors reaches approximately 500,000 people in 13 countries including Guatemala, Burkina Faso, Mali, Haiti, Peru, Bolivia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, India, Nepal, Indonesia and Timor-Leste. Since 1951, World Neighbors has helped 26 million people in 45 countries. World Neighbors was founded by Dr. John L. Peters in 1951, who was the organization's executive director until 1977. The organization is headquartered in Oklahoma City, OK. Peters launched the first World Neighbors programs in India. Programs World Neighbors works with partner organizations in approximately 45 programs in 13 countries: Haiti, Guatemala, Bolivia, Peru, Burkina Faso, Mali, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, India, Nepal, Indonesia, and Timor Leste. World Neighbors works in areas where there is greatest need for its programs and capacity building. Partnering with local affiliates who know the people, culture and landscape, World Neighbors gauges community interest in its approach by talking with rural villagers before beginning its work. The organization emphasizes experimental solutions, meaning that they do not prescribe one-size-fits-all solutions, but works with the members of the community to find solutions that best fit unique conditions. Specifically, World Neighbors works in remote rural communities where there are few roads, little or no access to clean water or electricity, limited health services and few schools. Infant and maternal death rates and illiteracy rates are among the highest in the world. Often the land and forests are degraded, and most of the citizens are excluded from mainstream economic development and decision making. World Neighbors stays in a program area until communities and local organizations become strong enough to continue their programs on their own. This process takes an average of 8 to 10 years. World Neighbors goal is to achieve long-lasting improvements and independence in people‚Äôs lives and their communities, not quick fixes that depend on external assistance. Method of operation World Neighbors works to help people develop, manage and sustain their own programs. Most programs begin using locally available resources and simple, low-cost technologies. As people gain skills and confidence, local leaders and organizations emerge to carry on the work, multiply results and participate in coalitions advocating for wider change. The role of World Neighbors is to strengthen these basic human and organizational resources for long-term development. World Neighbors does not give away food or material aid. Instead, it provides training so that people gain the skills and leadership to work together for change. The result is self-reliance, rather than dependence on external aid. World Neighbors does not determine the focus of the program, but asks people to set their own agenda. Programs include: food security, farming, literacy, health, family planning, water and sanitation, environmental conservation, savings and credit, non-formal education and income generation activities. The organization lists its top four initiatives as Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods, Community Based Natural Resource Management, Community and Reproductive Health and Gender Equality. These initiatives coincide with aspects of human and economic development because proper management of resources and sustainable agriculture foster economic growth and reproductive health and gender equality increase the quality of human life on a social level.  Process  A seven step process for the World Neighbors programs, according to its website: 1\\\\. Select the areas where we work on the basis of need and opportunity. 2\\\\. Listen to what they have to say and what limits their success and establish a relationship of trust. 3\\\\. Help strengthen their capacity to identify, analyze and solve their own problems using locally available resources and the simplest tools to do the job. 4\\\\. Try new ideas on a small scale. Stay practical to generate early enthusiasm and success. 5\\\\. Help document the results and apply lessons learned to improve programs. 6\\\\. Reinforce their capacity to maintain and multiply results and ongoing problem- solving processes by forming new partnerships and by coordinating with additional villages and local organizations. 7\\\\. Widen program impact by documenting and sharing the results and processes with larger-scale organizations, villages, networks, coalitions and governments to influence policies and actions.World Neighbors - How We Work & Where We Work Revenue and Spending World Neighbors invests funds in training and support programs for the people in our program areas. These programs promote self-reliance and more effective use of local resources. World Neighbors does not employ external consultants or buy imported goods, warehouses or material aid. Private donations have been the primary mode of support since World Neighbors was founded in 1951. Gifts from individuals and charitable foundations are World Neighbors largest sources of income, representing 46.72% of the total revenue as of 2016. World Neighbors also receives income from endowments, as well as donations from civic organizations, congregations, corporations and grants from development assistance organizations. Approximately 82% of the money spent by World Neighbors goes directly to programs and projects while 10.8% is lost to fundraising expenses. World Neighbors receives a good rating for the category of fundraising considering it spends $0.11 to generate $1 of funds, placing it in the second category of fundraising efficiency for the $0.11-0.20 range, based on ratings from Charity Navigator. High fundraising efficiency means that the organization is able to spend less money to generate revenue for its cause. Administration and staff A team of 4 staff members based in the United States supports 50 field staff members, more than 45 local partner organizations and hundreds of rural community-level volunteers in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Relying on volunteers and local affiliates helps World Neighbors to keep costs low and ensure that Most international staff members are citizens of the countries where they work. World Neighbors works with existing local organizations already working in the area and supports their promoters to train community-level volunteers and leaders. A volunteer board of trustees, whose members come from throughout the United States, governs World Neighbors. Kate Schecter, President and CEO, leads the organization's operations, and is assisted by a coordinating team composed of senior staff members. Following a brief period with Feed the Children, in 2016, World Neighbors president and CEO Kate Schecter and the board approved a budget that restored World Neighbor's independence.  Charity Ratings  Charity Navigator and GiveWell.org are two independent charity rating organizations that analyze various aspects of a charity in order to give it a holistic rating based on transparency and accountability. As of December 2017, Charity Navigator gave World Neighbors four out of four stars and the second highest rating for spending to raise additional funds. The rating is based on compliance with the following accountability and transparency performance metrics: * Independent voting board members * No material diversion of assets * Audited financials prepared by independent accountant * Does not provide loan(s) to or receive loan(s) from related parties * Documents board meeting minutes * Provided copy of Form 990 to organization's governing body in advance of filing * Conflict of interest policy * Whistleblower policy * Records retention and destruction policy * CEO listed with salary * Process for determining CEO compensation * Board listed/Board members not compensated References External links * World Neighbors * Work of Women Category:Development charities based in the United States Category:Hunger relief organizations Category:Charities based in Oklahoma ","title":"World Neighbors"},{"id":"7211158","text":"Location of Scott Valley in California Scott Valley is a large, scenic rural area of western Siskiyou County, California, known for its vistas of the Marble Mountains, cattle and dairy ranches, and its historic background as a gold mining area, dating back to the days of the California Gold Rush. The towns of Fort Jones, Etna, Greenview and Callahan are found within Scott Valley, as well as many other small villages. Drained by the federally designated Wild & Scenic Scott River, Scott Valley is steeped in history. At the time of the first contact with Europeans in the 1830s, the valley was occupied by the Scott Valley branch of the Shasta tribe of Native Americans. Scott Valley was first entered by Stephen Meek, Thomas McKay, George Adolphus Duzel and 16 other Hudson's Bay trappers in 1836. Meek reportedly trapped 1,800 beaver from the valley in the year 1850 alone. Meek, who had hunted all over the West, declared the Beaver Valley, soon to be renamed Scott Valley, one of the best places he had ever seen to trap beaver and hunt game, and returned to retire there at the Josiah Doll ranch from 1871 until his death in 1889 at the age of 90. An early road, an alternative to the Siskiyou Trail, wound its way up from Shasta, California, through Scott Valley to Yreka, California, and then into Oregon. This route remained in steady use until the development of more established stagecoach roads in the 1860s (and later the railroad in the 1880s) along the Sacramento River to the east. Today the valley is served by California State Route 3, linking Hayfork, CA & Weaverville, CA to Yreka, Ca. It serves as the link between other regional thoroughfares, California State Route 299 & California State Route 36 to the northern stretch of the regions primary north-south expressway, Interstate 5 (California). The 1850 discovery of gold during the California Gold Rush by pioneer John W. Scott at Scott Bar, downriver from Scott Valley, brought many prospectors into the area; Scott's discovery led to the naming of the valley and the river in his honor. The town of Fort Jones started in the 1850s first as trading post for the Forty-Niners who came in search of gold, and later took the name Fort Jones from a U.S. Army post which was established nearby. Scott Valley's weekly newspaper the Pioneer Press, located at 12021 Main Street in Fort Jones, was established on November 16, 1972, by Gary Mortenson. The town of Etna was the site of early mills supplying flour and was originally named Aetna Mills. Gold recovery operations continued well into the Twentieth century, including substantial dredging for gold along the Scott River. Until the mid-1990s Scott Valley's economy relied heavily on logging, an industry which is now in decline. A local native plant, the Scott Valley phacelia (Phacelia greenei), was named for the valley and is found nowhere else.

Fuegians are one of the three tribes of indigenous inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, at the southern tip of South America. In English, the term originally referred to the Yaghan people of Tierra del Fuego. In Spanish, the term fueguino can refer to any person from the archipelago. The indigenous Fuegians belonged to several different tribes including the Ona (Selk'nam), Haush (Manek'enk), Yaghan (Y√°mana), and Alacaluf (Kaw√©sqar). All of these tribes except the Selk'nam lived exclusively in coastal areas and have their own languages. The Yaghans and the Alacaluf traveled by birchbark canoes around the islands of the archipelago, while the coast dwelling Haush did not. The Selk'nam lived in the interior of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and lived mainly by hunting guanacos. The Ona were exclusively terrestrial hunter gatherers that hunted terrestrial game such as guanacos, foxes, tuco-tucos and upland nesting birds as well as littoral fish and shellfish. The Fuegian peoples spoke several distinct languages: both the Kaw√©sqar language and the Yaghan language are considered language isolates, while the Selk'nams spoke a Chon language like the Tehuelches on the mainland. European contact In 1876 a serious smallpox epidemic decimated the Fuegians. Between 1881 and 1883 the Yahgan population dropped from perhaps 3,000 to only 1,000 due to measles and smallpox. When Chileans and Argentines of European descent studied, invaded and settled on the islands in the mid-19th century, they brought with them diseases such as measles and smallpox for which the Fuegians had no immunity. The Fuegian population was devastated by the diseases, and their numbers were reduced from several thousand in the 19th century to hundreds in the 20th century.Die letzten Feuerland-Indianer / Ein Naturvolk stirbt aus. (Short article in German, with title ‚ÄúThe last Fuegians / An indigenous people becomes extinct‚Äù). Archived from the original. As early as 1878 Europeans in Punta Arenas seeking additional sheep pastures negotiated to acquire large tracts of land on Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from the Chilean government just prior to Argentina and Chile's sovereignty here. By 1876 the British missionaries claimed to have converted the entire Yamana people. On May 11, 1830 several Fuegians (Alacaluf) were transported to England by the schooner Allen Gardiner, presented to the court, and resided there for a number of years before three were returned. The United States Exploring Expedition came in contact with the Fuegians in 1839. One member of the expedition called the Fuegians the \\"greatest mimics I ever saw.\\" European genocide The Selk'nam genocide was authorized and conducted by the estancieros that between 1884‚Äì1900 resulted in a severe indigenous population decline. Large companies paid sheep farmers or militia a bounty for each Selk'nam dead, which was confirmed on presentation of a pair of hands or ears, or later a complete skull. They were given more for the death of a woman than a man.  Material culture  \\"Archaeological investigations show the prevalence of maritime hunter-gatherer organization throughout the occupation of the region (6400 BP ‚Äì 19th century).\\" Although the Fuegians were all hunter-gatherers,Gusinde 1966:6‚Äì7 their material culture was not homogeneous: the big island and the archipelago made two different adaptations possible. Some of the cultures were coast-dwelling, while others were land-oriented.Service 1973:115Extinct Ancient Societies Tierra del Fuegians Neither was restricted to Tierra del Fuego: * The coast provided fish, sea birds, otters, seals, shellfish in winter and sometimes also whales. Yaghans got their sustenance this way. Alacalufs (living in the Strait of Magellan and some islands), and Chonos (living further to the north, on Chilean coasts and archipelagos) were similar. Most whales were stranded but some whaling occurred. * Selk'nams lived on the inland plain of the big island of Tierra del Fuego, communally hunting herds of guanaco. The material culture had some similarities to that of the (also linguistically related) Tehuelches living outside Tierra del Fuego in the southern plains of Argentina.Gusinde 1966:5 All Fuegian tribes had a nomadic lifestyle, and lacked permanent shelters. The guanaco-hunting Selk'nam made their huts out of stakes, dry sticks, and leather. They broke camp and carried their things with them, and wandered following the hunting and gathering possibilities. The coastal Yamana and Alacaluf also changed their camping places, traveling by birchbark canoes.Gusinde 1966:7 Distribution of pre-Hispanic people of Chile  Spiritual culture   Mythology  There are some correspondences or putative borrowings between the Y√°mana and Selk'nam mythologies.Gusinde 1966:10 The hummingbird was an animal revered by the Y√°manas, and the Taiyin creation myth explaining the creation of the archipelago's water system, the culture hero \\"Taiyin\\" is portrayed in the guise of a hummingbird.Gusinde 1966:175‚Äì176 A Y√°mana myth, \\"The egoist fox\\", features a hummingbird as a helper and has some similarities to the Taiyin-myth of the Selk'nam.Gusinde 1966:183 Similar remarks apply to the myth about the big albatross: it shares identical variants for both tribes.Gusinde 1966:179 Some examples of myths having shared or similar versions in both tribes: * the myth about a sea lion and his [human] wife;Gusinde 1966:178 * the myth about the origin of death.Gusinde 1966: 182 All three Fuegian tribes had myths about culture heroes.Gusinde 1966:71 Y√°manas have dualistic myths about the two yoalox-brothers (). They act as culture heroes, and sometimes stand in an antagonistic relation to each other, introducing opposite laws. Their figures can be compared to the Selk'nam Kwanyip-brothers.Gusinde 1966:181 In general, the presence of dualistic myths in two compared cultures does not necessarily imply relatedness or diffusion.Zolotarjov 1980:56 Some myths also feature shaman-like figures with similarities in the Y√°mana and Selk'nam tribes.Gusinde 1966:186 The abundant and nutritious patagonian blenny (Eleginops maclovinus) were apparently not consumed and the rock art suggests they may have had some religious significance.  Shamanism  Both Selk'nam and Y√°mana had persons filling in shaman-like roles. The Selk'nams believed their xon () to have supernatural capabilities, e.g. to control weatherGusinde 1966:175 and to heal.Gusinde 1966:67 The figure of xon appeared in myths, too.Gusinde 1966:15 The Y√°mana yekamush ()Gusinde 1966:156 corresponds to the Selk'nam xon. There are myths in both Y√°m√°na and Selk'nam tribes about a shaman using his power manifested as a whale. In both examples, the shaman was \\"dreaming\\" while achieving this.Gusinde 1966:64Gusinde 1966:155 For example, the body of the Selk'nam xon lay undisturbed while it was believed that he travelled and achieved wonderful deeds (e.g. taking revenge on a whole group of peoples). The Y√°mana yekamush made similar achievements while dreaming: he killed a whale and led the dead body to arbitrary places, and transformed himself into a whale as well. In another Selk'nam myth, the xon could use his power also for transporting whale meat. He could exercise this capability from great distances and see everything that happened during the transport.Gusinde 1966:61  Gender  There is a belief in both the Selk'nam and Y√°mana tribes that women used to rule over men in ancient times, Y√°mana attribute the present situation to a successful revolt of men. There are many festivals associated with this belief in both tribes.Gusinde 1966:184Service 1973:116‚Äì117 The patrilineal Ona and the composite band society Yahgan reacted very differently to the Europeans and it has been suggested that this was due to these facets of their cultural structure.  Contacts between Y√°mana and Selk'nam  The principal differences in language, habitat, and adaptation techniques did not promote contacts, although eastern Y√°mana groups had exchange contacts with the Selk'nam. Language The languages spoken by the Fuegians are all extinct, with the exception of the Yaghan language and Kawesqar. The Selk'nam language was related to the Tehuelche language and belonged to the Chon family of languages. The Onan language had more than 30,000 words. Alternative origin speculations Alongside the Peric√∫es of Baja California, the Fuegians and Patagonians show the strongest evidence of partial descent from the Paleoamerican lineage,Gonz√°lez-Jos√©, R. et al., \\"Craniometric evidence for Palaeoamerican survival in Baja California\\", Nature vol. 425 (2003), 62‚Äì65. \\"A current issue on the settlement of the Americas refers to the lack of morphological affinities between early Holocene human remains (Palaeoamericans) and modern Amerindian groups, as well as the degree of contribution of the former to the gene pool of the latter. A different origin for Palaeoamericans and Amerindians is invoked to explain such a phenomenon. Under this hypothesis, the origin of Palaeoamericans must be traced back to a common ancestor for Palaeoamericans and Australians, which departed from somewhere in southern Asia and arrived in the Australian continent and the Americas around 40,000 and 12,000 years before present, respectively. Most modern Amerindians are believed to be part of a second, morphologically differentiated migration. [...] The principal coordinate plot obtained using the matrix of minimum genetic distances (Fig. 1a) showed that BCS [Baja California series] was closely linked with Palaeoamericans, whereas the populations from Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego showed an intermediate position between classical Amerindians and/or East Asians and Palaeoamericans\\". a proposed early wave of migration to the Americas derived from an Australo-Melanesian population, as opposed to the main Amerind peopling of the Americas of Siberian (admixed Ancient North Eurasian and Paleo-East Asian) descent. Further credibility is lent to this idea by research suggesting the existence of an ethnically distinct population elsewhere in South America.\\"Fuegian and Patagonian Genetics ‚Äì and the settling of the Americas\\" , by George Weber. According to archaeologist Ricardo E. Latcham the sea-faring nomads of Patagonia (Chonos, Kaw√©sqar, Yaghan) may be remnants from more widespread indigenous groups that were pushed south by \\"successive invasions\\" from more northern tribes.

The swamp developed in a former lake basin, as it was filled by an alluvial fan or deposits of water-transported material. Archaeological evidence for early agricultural drainage systems was found here, beginning about 9,000 years ago. It includes draining ditches of three major classes, which were used to convert the area to an anthropogenic grassland. The native crop taro was grown here. In addition, evidence of cultivation of bananas and sugar cane has been found, estimated to have begun 6,900 ‚Äì 6,400 years ago. The Kuk Swamp was recognized in 2008 as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It was one of the places in the world where people independently developed agriculture. Background The Kuk creek is believed to flow through the entirety of the fan to a catchment in the lower hills of the south region. Some channels were built to carry the water past the reach of the fan. If these channels were blocked, as evidence suggests, the area would develop as a swamp, diverting the water into smaller distributary channels. Evidence for early agricultural drainage systems was found here, beginning about 9,000 years ago. Features such as pits, postholes, and runnels have been found at the site, indicating evidence of early agriculture. Such features are consistent with planting, digging and tethering of plants. In addition, evidence has been found of irrigation draining ditches, dating back to 9,000 years ago. A number of plants, including taro were grown, at what would have been the edge of its cultivable limit in the highlands. These ditches can be divided into three types: major disposal channels, large field ditches, and small field ditches. The major disposal channels were built to divert water from the fan flowing south and direct them toward the northeast areas. The large and small field ditches are more uniform, surrounding the perimeter of the planting areas. They connect with the major disposal channels. During this time, the people of Kuk Swamp transformed their landscape into an anthropogenic grassland suitable for agriculture. During archaeological excavation of the drainage channels, researchers found artefacts including wooden digging sticks, a grindstone, and other small items. The ditches were cleaned out, and a small trench was dug to study the different layers of clay used to construct the ditches. These different layers suggest that the ditches were deliberately constructed by people. Dated to 6,900 ‚Äì 6,400 years ago, additional archaeobotanical evidence has been found showing the cultivation of bananas and sugar cane. Many banana phytoliths have been found in the cultivation plots of Kuk Swamp. Since bananas do not produce phytoliths in the same quantity and frequency as grass and other plants, researchers have concluded that the abundance of banana phytoliths found in a managed grassed landscape between 6950 and 6550 years ago suggests deliberate planting.Denham, T.P., S.G.

The Congress of Vienna demanded that Louis bring in a constitution of some form before he was restored. Public law of the French The opening twelve articles of the Charter are analogous to a \\"Bill of Rights\\". They contained such measures as a declaration of equality before the law, due process rights, religious toleration, freedom of the press, protection of private property, and abolition of conscription. These principles, together with the retention of the Napoleonic Code, represent some of the permanent gains of the French Revolution. Nevertheless, the concept of the judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation was undeveloped, and it was the responsibility of the legislature, not the courts, to defend these rights. Freedom of the press, in particular, was subsequently restricted by harsh press censorship laws, which were deemed to violate the spirit of the charter. Moreover, religious toleration was limited by the special provision made for the Catholic Church as the official state religion. The King and his Ministers The King occupied a central position under the Charter of 1814. The Charter declared that the king was Head of State and chief executive: the King appointed public officials, issued the ordinances and regulations necessary \\"for the execution of the laws and the security of the state\\", commanded the army and navy, declared war, and made \\"treaties of peace, alliance and commerce\\" (Articles 13 and 14). In addition, the King had great influence over the legislative power, since he possessed the sole right to present draft laws to Parliament (Article 16), and the right to grant or withhold assent to laws passed by the Parliament (Article 20). The King summoned and prorogued Parliament and had the right to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies and call new elections (Article 50). The King also appointed the members of the House of Peers (Article 27). In the judicial field, the King appointed judges (Article 57) and had the power of pardon (Article 67). The Chambers In imitation of the British model, the Charter of 1814 established a bicameral legislature, consisting of a Chamber of Deputies and a Chamber of Peers. The Chamber of Deputies was elected, but with a high tax qualification. The election took place in two stages, with voters choosing members of Electoral Colleges, who in turn elected Deputies. Members of Electoral Colleges had to pay 300 francs a year in direct taxes (Article 40), while Deputies themselves had to pay a direct tax of 1000 Francs a year. As taxes were mainly levied on landed wealth, this restricted the Chamber of Deputies to a very small percentage of the richest landowners. The representative basis of the French parliament under the Charter was thus much narrower than that which had been used to elect the Estates-General under the Ancien R√©gime. Moreover, the Presidents of the Electoral Colleges were appointed by the King, giving the government the ability to influence the outcome of elections. The Chamber of Peers was appointed by the King, and could consist of both hereditary aristocrats and life peers ennobled in recognition of public service (Article 27). The number of peers was unlimited, meaning that the King could, at any time, add to their number. In addition to its legislative and deliberative role, the Chamber of Peers also acted as a special court for the trial of impeachments (Article 55) and for cases of \\"high treason and attacks against the security of the state\\" (Article 33). The members of the two Chambers enjoyed certain parliamentary privileges, including immunity from arrest (Articles 34 and 52). The President (Speaker) of the Chamber of Deputies was appointed by the King from a list of five members presented by the Chamber (Article 43), while the Chamber of Peers was presided over by the Chancellor of France, an official appointed by the King (Article 29). The consent of both Chambers was necessary for the passage of a law. There was no provision for joint sessions or other constitutional means of resolving differences between the Chambers. Proposed laws (bills) could be initiated by the King in either Chamber, except for laws concerning taxes, which had to be initiated in the Chamber of Deputies (Article 17). A constitutional, but not parliamentary, monarchy The King's powers were for the most part exercised by his Ministers. The Ministers were chosen by the King. Article 13 stated open-endedly that \\"Ministers are responsible\\", but the nature of this responsibility was ambiguous and its extent limited. Articles 55 and 56 restricted this responsibility to \\"acts of treason and peculation\\". Moreover, responsibility could only be enforced by impeachment‚Äîarraignment by the Chamber of Deputies and trial by the Chamber of Peers. Thus, the Charter gave no recognition to the principle of modern parliamentary government, namely that the Ministers are not just legally, but also politically, responsible to Parliament, and that Parliament can remove Ministers by a simple vote of no- confidence, without having to bring impeachment proceedings. In this respect, the Charter was not dissimilar to other constitutional documents of its time (even in Britain, where the responsibility of Ministers to Parliament had been established in the eighteenth century, it remained on a purely conventional basis). Therefore, the challenge for the liberal elements of French politics during the Restoration era was to develop a convention of parliamentary government according to which: (i) the King would act only on the advice of his Ministers, and (ii) the Ministers, although formally appointed by the King, would be drawn from amongst the leaders of the majority in Parliament, and would be required to resign if they lost the confidence of Parliament. Owing to the narrow franchise, the dominance of the reactionary Ultra party, and the personal intervention of the King, these conventions did not develop during the period from 1814‚Äì1830. Thus, although monarchy under the charter was constitutional, it never evolved into a truly parliamentary system of government. Status and amendment The Charter was presented as a gift from the King to the people, not as a constituent act of the people. It ended with the words \\"Given at Paris, in the year of grace 1814, and of our reign the nineteenth\\"; this commitment to the principles of \\"legitimism\\" would put the reign of Louis XVIII beginning in June 1795, after the death of Louis XVII, the youngest son of Louis XVIII's brother Louis XVI. The King and his successors were bound to swear an oath (Article 74) to maintain the Charter. The Charter contained no provision for future amendment. According to one reading, this made the Charter a truly fundamental law, binding on the King, the Chambers, and the people alike. However, the 1830 revolution established the principle that the Charter, which was then reissued in amended form, could be changed, in the same way as an ordinary law, by the joint act of the King and the Chambers.

The episode attracted approximately 2.2 million viewers on its American broadcast, a ratings success for the Sci Fi Channel. The episode begins with the mass suicide of the Asgard race, who try to preserve their legacy by giving all of their accumulated knowledge and technology to the SG-1 team and the crew of the Earth ship Odyssey. When the ship is attacked by Ori warships, Lieutenant- Colonel Samantha Carter creates a time dilation field. The field was programmed so while only fractions of a second had passed outside of the field, It takes fifty years inside the field until a defense against the Ori weapons can be found.  Plot  The members of SG-1 and General Hank Landry (Beau Bridges) are travelling on the Earth ship Odyssey to the Asgard home world, Orilla, when the Asgard Thor beams aboard. He reveals that after millennia of genetic manipulation, a disease has brought his race very close to extinction, and SG-1 accepts his offer to upload the sum of all Asgard's knowledge into Odyssey as a way to preserve the Asgard legacy after their mass suicide. However, Orilla and Odyssey are soon attacked by Ori warships. Orilla erupts with huge explosions, eventually blowing up completely, bringing about the extinction of the Asgard race. After Odyssey escapes to the next planet with a Stargate and beams the bulk of its crew down, the Ori fire a final energy beam upon the ship. Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) activates a localized time dilation field that makes time look frozen outside the field to give SG-1 and Landry time to find a defense. During the initial months on board, Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) repeatedly tries to seduce Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks). Daniel finally confronts Vala for what he believes to be her insincerity, teasing, and mocking of him. Vala's upset reaction makes Daniel realize the honesty of her feelings, and they share a passionate embrace. As the years pass, each team member attempts to deal with the isolation. General Landry develops a gardening hobby; Carter learns how to play the cello; Daniel continues the translation of Asgard information in the database and develops his relationship with Vala; and Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) exercise and train while Mitchell is growing more frustrated and angry. After many years, General Landry succumbs to old age and dies. After fifty years Carter has devised a way to reverse time within a localized field, however the Odyssey's power source (ZPM) is almost completely depleted from maintaining the time dilation field for fifty years. Mitchell hypothesizes that the power of the Ori energy beam could provide the required energy to reverse the time. But to accomplish the operation, one person has to exist outside of the time reversal; this person will remain at their advanced age while everyone else would revert to how they were 50 years prior (thus having no memories of those 50 years). Teal'c, who as a Jaffa has a much longer lifespan than the other team members, volunteers to remain behind and perform the rescue, protected within a separate field. As the group prepares their plan, Vala and Daniel exchange a last embrace, assuring each other of their love. When everything is in place, they deactivate the time dilation field and, after the normal timeline is restored, Teal'c prevents Colonel Carter from activating the time dilation field. Odyssey leaves before it is destroyed, saving SG-1 and the Asgard's legacy. Back at the SGC (Stargate Command), Teal'c refuses to reveal any of the events on the ship, much to Vala's disappointment. As the episode, the season and the series come to a close, SG-1 contemplates Teal'c's joking words of wisdom in the gateroom and says \\"indeed\\" all at once. General Landry wishes the team God-speed, and SG-1 steps through the gate on their next mission.  Production  \\"Unending\\" is the fiftieth Stargate SG-1 episode written by Robert C. Cooper, and the second episode of the series directed by Cooper. Being the series' tenth-season finale, \\"Unending\\" was the fifth season-finale to potentially serve as Stargate SG-1's last episode, although the writers originally anticipated another renewal of the series and planned to end the season with a cliffhanger. However, the Sci-Fi Channel announced the series' cancellation in August 2006, approximately one month before \\"Unending\\" was written. The network opposed the idea of a cliffhanger leading up to a possible movie, and since the producers never intended \\"to blow up the SGC and kill everyone\\", the episode's theme and name were chosen to give \\"a sense of ending without it being an ending\\". The option to end the series with a two- parter was considered but rejected, as Cooper felt this would have made the ending less special. The buildup of the Ori arc in Seasons 9 and 10 would eventually get a pay-off in Stargate: The Ark of Truth, a film produced after the end of the show. The cast and crew knew by the end of the episode's filming on October 5, 2006 that more films would be produced. There had been early discussions for Richard Dean Anderson to return as Jack O'Neill, however the show was over-budget, and with the series already cancelled the studio wouldn't be willing to cover his salary. Robert C. Cooper, who wrote and directed \\"Unending\\", locked the SG-1 team together for fifty years to accommodate the fan wish of an ultimate team episode. Robert C. Cooper intended the episode as \\"an emotional tribute to the ten seasons that [had] come before\\" and \\"the last chapter in the book ‚Äì but not necessarily in the series of books. It was a chance [...], using science fiction, to show people one version of what the future might be like for these characters that they've spent so much time with and loved so much.\\" By killing off the Asgard race, Cooper gave the episode an element of tragedy that reflected his feelings at the time. Producer Brad Wright wanted all of the characters to get a last shot in the spotlight instead of focusing on only one character. Because of fan vocality about team episodes, Cooper decided to put the characters through several decades of life and see their relationships develop and evolve. The references in \\"Unending\\" to the events of season 2's \\"The Fifth Race\\", another Cooper-penned episode often named as a fan favorite, were intended, as were the callbacks to season 9's \\"The Ties That Bind\\" (the Daniel-Vala argument, see below) and season 10's \\"Line In The Sand\\" (the solution of using the Ori beam). The period aboard the ship was originally significantly less than fifty years, but the actors' last-stage makeup, which Cooper only saw minutes before filming, looked so old that Cooper was forced to increase the number of years in the script. Cooper originally wrote the developing romance between Daniel and Vala in \\"Unending\\" by having them have sex without a confrontation. Claudia Black and Michael Shanks protested against this intended story, as Shanks felt that \\"[t]here's always been this underlining, keeping [Vala] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close.\\" Cooper rewrote the scene to show Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel share his true feelings of a relationship. The actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in- character nor totally out-of-character. The scene was rehearsed a lot and was filmed over the course of six hours. Cooper was nevertheless concerned that Daniel appeared too edgy and mean, although his feelings were motivated by the two years of torment with Vala, and losing his wife nearly ten years before. Daniel's line, \\"You better not be messing with me\\", was only said in one take by Michael Shanks. Since Cooper prefers to follow up on such emotional scenes with a laugh, the immediate next scene shows Vala coming out of Daniel's room, where she encounters a disbelieving Mitchell jogging by. In Cooper's mind, Daniel held a crying Vala in another scene because she had gotten pregnant and had lost the baby. To contrast the obvious relationship between Daniel and Vala, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge subtly played their scenes as if their characters also had a romantic relationship. To give the Odyssey an unnatural ghostship feeling of solitude, many wide angle shots and VisFX matte extension were used with no additional music. Robert C. Cooper often listened to the CCR song \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\\" during the making of the episode and decided to play it over the first montage, showing the passage of time. The tone of the second montage was set with a cello. Stargate composer Joel Goldsmith later accompanied the hand movements of the hired cellist with different music during post-production. A third montage was filmed but not included in the final cut of the episode since the last table scene already supplied the needed sentiment. Each time period included the same shots to help the audience focus on the differences that characters have gone through. The last scene at Stargate Command was the last filmed Stargate SG-1 scene, shot at two o'clock in the morning, for which every member of the crew came back.  Reception  The broadcast of \\"Unending\\" on the British channel Sky One on March 13, 2007 pulled in around 518,000 viewers, making Stargate SG-1 the third most-watched program for Sky One during that week. \\"Unending\\" attracted approximately 2.2 million viewers on its first American broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel on June 22, 2007, the best performance for SG-1 since the September 22, 2006 mid-season finale. Writer and producer Joseph Mallozzi acknowledged that some fans were unhappy with the end of the Asgard, the absence of Jack O‚ÄôNeill and Daniel and Vala getting together. Reviewers were generally satisfied with the conclusion, and some like Bill Keveney of the USA Today felt the episode does not stray far from \\"the series formula ‚Äì a mix of sci-fi adventure, relationships and humor\\". Jason Van Horn of IGN enjoyed the humor, \\"the amount of heart and pure emotion running rampant this episode\\", which he thought served as a symbol for the entire show that will stay in the public mind through re-runs and DVDs. Two scenes that stood out for him as \\"powerful\\", \\"heart-wrenching\\" and \\"the icing on the cake\\", were Mitchell's breakdown and Vala's seduction of Daniel signaling \\"the beginning of a very long lasting and loving relationship\\". Vala's emotional response to Daniel was interpreted as an example of her character growth, while another reviewer felt the \\"Vala/Daniel argument [was] a tad overwrought [although] the motivation is clear\\". The emotional death of Landry appealed to several reviewers, as did the resolution via Teal'c's heroic sacrifice. The \\"clever, ground-breaking\\", \\"fitting\\" and \\"hugely satisfying\\" episode reminded hdtvuk.tv's Ian Calcutt of Star Trek: The Next Generation's finale \\"All Good Things...\\", while TV Squad's Richard Keller noted strong similarities to a two-part episode of Star Trek: Voyager named \\"Year of Hell\\". He was \\"extremely sad to see [the series] go\\", but could not overlook the mediocrity, predictability and lack of originality of the series finale. TV Zone's Anthony Brown, who considered the episode \\"curious[ly] low-key\\", regretted the planned direct-to-DVD films, as \\"the whole thing inevitably loses its punch as the reset button's pressed [...], rather than providing the genuine emotion of an actual ending\\".. Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune thought that the episode went out on \\"a strange note\\" with a disappointing last \\"string of banal clich√©s\\" dialogue exchange, although the cast and the established goodwill of their characters could partly make up for it. Mary McNamara of Multichannel News lauded Cooper's direction, lighting, costuming, the \\"haunting\\" music and sound, the production values and special effects. She acknowledged the SG-1 finale as a \\"true ensemble/team piece\\" with \\"a poignant and satisfying conclusion\\", and despite not making it into the top ten of series finales, the episode was \\"very good\\" and \\"respects and rewards the ten year commitment viewers have made to the series\\". David Bianculli from the New York Daily Times gave the episode two and a half out of five and saying the franchise stopped \\"Without warning\\" thanks to this episode.

He is best known as the winner of the third season of American reality show Project Runway. Early career In the early 1990s, along with Mike Coulter and John Rozas Sebelia was a member of the band Lifter, which was signed by Interscope Records. They had a minor radio hit with the song \\"402,\\" but they disbanded. Lifter's song \\"Swing\\" was featured in Jeffrey's runway show at Olympus Fashion Week. After a successful drug rehabilitation at the age of 31, Sebelia enrolled in sewing classes at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. It was there that he immediately fell in love with design, and shortly after he started the clothing line Cosa Nostra. Among the label's celebrity clients were Dave Navarro, Gwen Stefani, Jennifer Lopez, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Marilyn Manson, Elton John, Madonna, and Tommy Lee. The Cosa Nostra label was available in about twenty stores worldwide. Project Runway In the spring of 2006, Sebelia auditioned for the Bravo series Project Runway after seeing the success his friend, former contestant Santino Rice, had enjoyed. Jeffrey was selected to compete, was one of the final four contestants to display their collections at Fashion Week, and was chosen the winner. He had been portrayed as the third season's \\"villain,\\" notorious for his explicit language and making fellow contestant Angela Keslar's mother cry when he worked with her as a client for a challenge. Sebelia's final winning collection was filled with bright colors, flowing dresses, and smart separates, his collection was strikingly different from the trademark grunge, punk, and rock 'n' roll-style outfits he had created throughout the season. His winnings included $100,000 to develop his own clothing line, a 2007 Saturn Sky Roadster, a year's representation by Designer's Management Agency, and a 15-page spread - featuring Marilinda Rivera, the model with whom he was paired during most of the Project Runway challenges - in ELLE magazine. Post- Project Runway Career Sebelia put his 100,000 prize into his brand Cosa Nostra. In 2007, he was hired to design a live-action film featuring the Bratz cartoon characters. He lost the gig after calling the characters \\"slutty\\" in an interview. In 2009, Cosa Nostra failed. Sebelia then put out an eponymous collection, but that too appears to have ended. In 2010 Sebelia was named head designer of a brand called Fluxus. He left that job to launch edgy kids line La Miniatura with friend, Melissa Bochco.http://www.laminiaturakids.com/about.php In 2013, Sebelia became a contestant on Project Runway: All Stars (season 3), where he ranked 7th out of 11 contestants.Introducing the Season 3 Cast! Personal life Sebelia shared a violent relationship with his father, who divorced his mother when Jeffrey was 8. Later, Jeffrey, who felt responsible for the divorce, began using cocaine and marijuana. By the time he was 16, he was a heroin addict living in a friend's garage. The following 15 years were filled with numerous, yet failed, attempts to get sober at a number of West Coast drug treatment centers. He has never been far from the spotlight and has been friends with Dave Navarro since they were teens.In depth LA Times Interview, with Jeffrey Sebelia.

It was Harrison, Sebelia's son, who inspired his trademark neck tattoo which took more than eight hours to complete. The tattoo reads \\"Harrison Detroit l‚Äôamor de la mia vita.\\" It is his son's name, along with the phrase \\"the love of my life,\\" in Italian.

It was available in hatchback, sedan and wagon body styles. Hatchback didn't share the same platform and Seat Ibiza, but saloon and estate models were rebadged Seat C√≥rdoba. The hatchback underwent a major facelift in 2000, while the saloon and the estate received only minor refinements. It now had a more different exterior and interior design than the also facelifted Seat Ibiza. In 2001, it was discontinued and replaced by its successor, the Volkswagen Polo Mk4, but it continued production in Argentina, where the saloon was facelifted in 2004, receiving the exterior design applied to the facelifted Seat C√≥rdoba and the interior of the facelifted Volkswagen Polo. Overview Pre-facelift Volkswagen Polo Interior (pre-facelift) The MK3 Polo was unveiled on 31 August 1994, and was immediately available in left-hand drive form for continental markets, and was launched on the right-hand drive UK market in October that year. It was the first completely new Polo to be launched since the MK2 model in 1981; although that model had undergone a major restyle in 1990. It was also the first version of the Polo to be available with five doors as well as three doors. The initial range consisted of new 1.0 and 1.6 petrol engines; the 1.3 unit was carried over from the previous Polo but discontinued a year later in favour a new 1.4 unit, which became available around the same time as a 1.9 diesel and turbo-diesel models. The availability of a diesel Polo for the first time on the UK market brought it into line with almost all of its competitors, while the Polo was the last mainstream supermini in Europe to become available with five doors - five years after the Ford Fiesta was first available with five doors, and between seven and 11 years after the launch of five-door superminis including the Opel Corsa, Fiat Uno, Nissan Micra and Peugeot 205. The platform used for this model was all new, although it shared some components with SEAT Ibiza Mk2 which had been launched a year earlier. Although the dashboard and a number of mechanical components, including some engines and rear suspension, were shared with the Ibiza, outwardly the Polo models were entirely different with no body panels shared with the SEAT model. Initially, only three- and five-door hatchback versions were available. In 1995, four-door saloon (\\"Polo Classic/Sedan/Derby\\") and five-door estate (\\"Polo Wagon/Variant\\") versions were added to the range ‚Äî these were badge engineered and mildly restyled versions of the SEAT C√≥rdoba (the saloon and estate versions of the Ibiza). They were referred to internally by VW as the Typ 6KV, and shared body panels with the SEAT model rather than the hatchback models. A two-door coupe version of the Cordoba (the SX) was also produced, but the Polo was never made in this form. A convertible version was not produced, although a version with an electrically sliding full length sunroof, called the Polo Open Air, was available. Engines Initially the car was available with the 1043cc putting out , and the 1272cc putting out engines from the previous generation Polo, along with a new 1598cc unit. A new 1.4L engine replaced the 1.3L in October 1995. In September 1996 the 1043cc engine was replaced by an all-new aluminium block multi-point injection 999cc developing . The Classic and Variant models featured a or 1.6L and a 1.9L diesel and a 1.8L lux model with electric front windows. For the first time, a turbo-diesel engine (1.9L) was available in a Polo, although only in the 6K models. Due to its smaller engine bay, the standard 3 and 5-door 6N did not get a turbo-diesel engine until the facelift in 2000. The car was available with the following engines: * 1,043 cc straight-4 petrol (1995‚Äì96) * 1,272 cc straight-4 petrol (1995‚Äì96) * 1.6 L straight-4 petrol (Engine Code ‚Äì AEE) * 1.4 L straight-4 16-valve petrol (Engine Code ‚Äì AFH) stock but tuned 1.4 16v 75 Ps version * 1.4 L straight-4 16-valve petrol * 1.4 L straight-4 petrol (Engine Code AUD)(1996‚Äì) * 999 cc straight-4 petrol ‚Äî all-new aluminium block multi-point injection (1996‚Äì) * 1.6 L straight-4 16-valve petrol (LHD European GTI model only) * 1.6 L straight-4 petrol (6K saloon and estate models only) * 1.6 L straight-4 petrol (6K saloon and estate models only) * 1.9 L straight-4 diesel Trim levels The Polo Mark 3 was much better equipped than its predecessor. A range of models featured items such as colour-coded bumpers, heated/electrically adjustable mirrors, four speaker stereo, pollen filters, central locking, rear head restraints, split rear seats, fog lights, alloy wheels, and airbags. The car was available originally in four trim levels ranging from the L at the bottom level of the scale through the CL and GL to the range topping GLX model. The range-topping was the Polo SE or Special Equipment; it featured a number of features from higher spec models such as the GLX bumpers, Sport Rader alloy wheels, tinted rear light clusters and clear indicators. Unlike the Volkswagen Polo Mk1 and Volkswagen Polo Mk2, trim levels were not the same across Europe; the United Kingdom's were L, CL, GL, GLX, 16v (later E, S, SE and GTi); models sold in Europe had trim levels which were individual to the country they were marketed in. The facelift at the end of 1999 saw the introduction of E, S and SE trim levels, as well as the 1.6 GTI which was the first to be sold in Britain. An all-new Polo was unveiled at the end of 2001, although the saloon and estate models continued in production until 2003, and were not replaced with any new additions to the newer Polo range. Variants Sporting variants Volkswagen Polo GTI 16V at the German Saxony Rally Sporting variants were not introduced initially, and a supercharged G40 version of the Mark 3 was never made, but a GTI model introduced in 1998 catered for the hot hatch market. With a limited production run of 3000 units, the 6N GTI was available only in continental Europe. Featuring a 1.6 16V 120 PS (88 kW) version of the unit that would later be found in the Mark 3F model, the car came with 15\\" BBS alloys and could sprint to in just 9.1 seconds. The 16V, introduced to replace the GLX, was one of the most popular Mark 3 versions with modifiers, it used a 1.4 16V unit pushed to 100 PS (74 kW) as standard. This car was not a pure sporting model, and with a 0‚Äì100 km/h time of 10.6 seconds and a 190 km/h (118 mph) top speed, it was not as fast as the sporting Ibiza model (which used a 2.0 L 16V engine). The Polo GTI was often seen as overpriced for the performance it delivered. Polo GTI 2000 Volkswagen Polo GTI interior Between 2000 and 2002 VW offered two sporting models, the 16V and GTI. The 16V came with the 1.4 16V 100 PS (74 kW) engine and had options such as 15\\" Spa alloys and air conditioning. However more interest was in the GTI. Available only in hatchback form, the GTI was powered by a 1.6 16V 125 PS (92 kW) engine with variable valve timing, making it the most powerful Polo to come out the factory to date. External changes gave the car the looks to match its power. Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15\\" BBS split rims suited the car well. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and gearstick, chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction). Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras. The Mark 3F Polo GTI however missed the new six- speed gearbox that was introduced in the smaller Lupo GTI. Polo Harlekin Multicoloured Polo Harlekin In Europe, a limited edition \\"Harlekin\\" model was released in 1995. The Polo Harlekin featured multi-coloured body panels with a symmetrical combination of Tornado Red, Ginster Yellow, Pistachio Green and Chagall Blue. Harlekin Polos used the 1.6 petrol engine and featured special \\"Joker\\" pattern seats and bespoke gear knob and steering wheel. Originally limited to 1,000, around 3,800 of this series were produced. 2,500 Polo Harlekins were made in the UK between 1996 and 1998. Facelift The facelifted Mark III Phase II (or Typ 6N2; sometimes referred to as the Mark IIIF or \\"Mark 5\\" by enthusiasts) was released in 1999. The hatchback models featured updated styling including new headlights and bumpers and an all new interior based on that of the Lupo. Although the car was similar in appearance to the Mark 3 (the bodyshell was fully galvanised and stiffened but not fully redesigned, although some panels were changed), Volkswagen claimed that 70% of the components were new. Power steering, antilock brakes and twin airbags were made standard. The saloon and estate versions received the new interior, but not the full exterior facelift. Also, the three-cylinder 1.4-litre TDI engine was introduced for the three and five-door hatchbacks. Specification options ranged from power steering, tinted glass, split rear seats, electric windows and cup holders to ABS, air conditioning, Xenon headlights and satellite navigation. Thirty-two models with seven engines ranging from the 1.4 diesel to the 1.6 L 16V GTI made the choice of Polo the widest ever seen. The base model was the Comfortline with the option of no less than 5 engines ranging from the 1.0 50 PS (37 kW) to the 1.9 TDI unit found across the VW range, producing 90 PS (66 kW). The 1.0 L hatchback was considered cheap for the build quality and spec list when compared to other cars. Then came the Trendline and Highline models. With engine options ranging from 60 PS (44 kW) to a 110 PS (81 kW) diesel they offered a range of features usually found on the more sporty models but without the insurance or running cost woes. Volkswagen also introduced a GTI version of this facelift, this time also available outside of Germany. The GTI is equipped with a further developed 1.6l 16v engine from the 6N with 92 kW (125 hp), this time with VVT (Variable Valve Timing) which activates from 5,000 revs, making the engine sound more exuberant. The GTI is recognizable by original Xenon lighting with headlight washers (the only one in the 6N2 range), honeycomb grills, 10mm factory lowered suspension, a thicker front lip and original 15\\" BBS rims with 195mm wide tires. Both versions of the Mark III Polo were strong sellers in the United Kingdom and strong competitor for the likes of the Fiat Punto and Nissan Micra. At the time of its launch, it was arguably the best small car on sale in Europe in terms of build quality and \\"upmarket\\" feel, although its ride and handling was generally not considered to be as good as that of the Ford Fiesta or Peugeot 206. The 1.4 TDI was considered the best in the range due to its reliability, fuel consumption, and relative power, for a small engine.

It was sold & assembled as the FAW- VW City-Golf during 1996. This version was also sold in Russia as the Volkswagen Polo Classic S. It is not to be confused with the Canadian Mark 4 City Golf released in 2006 in Canada. Latin America Argentine facelifted Polo Classic In Argentina, Volkswagen produced the Polo Classic, which was sold as the Derby in Mexico, and the Volkswagen Caddy, a SEAT Inca-derived van, which shares the same platform and front end styling as the Polo Classic. The Polo Classic (Typ 6K) and the Caddy (Typ 9K) have been produced since 2000. All the facelifted models are Argentine-built models. Latin America had its own trim levels, although some of the trim level names were similar to their European counterparts. The CL and GL were available from 1996 onwards in Brazil; these were similar to their European counterparts, although slightly more expensive due to import tariffs.

M. Cowan (ed.) (1976). The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic. Wiesbaden, Germany: Spoken Language Services. is the concept of divine destiny in Islam. It is one of Islam's six articles of faith, along with belief in the Oneness of Allah, the Revealed Books, the Prophets of Islam, the Day of Resurrection and Angels. This concept has also been mentioned in the Quran as the \\"Decree\\" of Allah.  Definition  In Islam, \\"predestination\\" is the usual English language rendering of a belief that Sunni Muslims call ' ( ). As per the Sunni understanding, the phrase means \\"the divine decree and the predestination\\"; al-qadr more closely means \\"(divine) power\\", deriving from the root ŸÇ ÿØ ÿ± (q-d-r), which denotes concepts related to measuring out, aiming, calculating, preparing, being able, and having power.  Concept  Qadar is one of the aspects of aqidah. Muslims believe that the divine destiny is when God wrote down in the Preserved Tablet (al-lawh al-mahfooz) (several other spellings are used for this in English) all that has happened and will happen, which will come to pass as written. According to this belief, a person's action is not caused by what is written in the preserved tablet, but rather the action is written in the tablet because God already knows all occurrences without the restrictions of time.Moral Responsibility and Divine Will. Re: Blaming Destiny? On the other hand, the causal relationships are also part of Qadar, since human acts affect what is stated in the Preserved Tablet. The phrase reflects a Muslim doctrine that Allah has measured out the span of every person's life, their lot of good or ill fortune, and the fruits of their efforts.ŸÖŸàŸÇÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ•ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖ ÿ≥ÿ§ÿßŸÑ Ÿàÿ¨Ÿàÿßÿ® - ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä - islamqa.info Again Allah does not need to force anyone to do good or evil by interfering with his will, and nobody will bear witness that Allah did so. When referring to the future, Muslims frequently qualify any predictions of what will come to pass with the phrase Insha'Allah, Arabic for \\"if God willed [it].\\" The phrase recognizes that human knowledge of the future is limited, and that all that may or may not come to pass is under the control and knowledge of God. However, people are not predestined by Allah to enter Hell. Rather, people will only bear their own sins that they themselves committed with free will and no one will be responsible for another person's deeds. The Quran holds that no man will be treated unjustly and everything will be judged by Allah. The Quran says this in the following verse: A hadith reports that Muhammad said about Qadr: However, it is made clear that no person has the power to benefit or harm himself or others, and that guidance is only given by Allah, no one else has the power to give guidance. The Quran says:  History  There are only two groups who represent the extremes regarding Qadar. Jabariyah are of the opinion that humans have no control over their actions and everything is dictated by God. The other group is Qadariyah (not to be confused with the Sufi order, Qadiriyya) and they are of the opinion of humans having complete control over their destiny, to the extent that God does not even know what humans will choose to do. The Sunni view is a synthesis of these two views, where they believe that God has knowledge of everything that will be, but that humans have freedom of choice. Among the historical proponents of the Sunni view of the doctrine were: *Ibn Umar was a strong proponent of this concept.431 hadith found in 'The Book of Faith (Kitab Al- Iman)' of Sahih Muslim. Among those who criticized the Sunni view of the doctrine were: *Ma'bad al-Juhani, the first man who discussed Qadar in Basra.  Sunni view  Sunni enumerate Qadar as one aspect of their creed (). They believe that the divine destiny is when God wrote down in the Preserved Tablet (\\"al-Lawhu 'l-Mahfuz\\") all that has happened and will happen, which will come to pass as written. However, this should not be considered within the limitations of time as human beings understand. In the Quran, God explicitly states that He will \\"write\\" the good for those who do righteous deeds. According to this belief, a person's action is not caused by what is written in the Preserved Tablet but, rather, the action is written in the Preserved Tablet because God already knows all occurrences without the restrictions of time. An individual has power to choose, but since God created time and space he knows what will happen. God is without any bond of time and space. Therefore, what will happen has meaning only to humans, who are limited in time and space. An analogy is someone who watches a movie for the second time, who knows what will happen next, while for the first time watcher the next move is unknown. According to Maturidi belief, all active possibilities are created by God and humans act in accordance with their free intention to choose which action they follow. In this way, the intention precedes the created action and capacity by which actions are acquired (kasb in Arabic).al- Maturidi al-Samarqandi, Abu Mansur Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Mahmoud (1970). Kitab at-Tawhid (English Introduction by Fathallah Kholeif) Beirut: Dar El- Machreq. p. xxxiv-xxxvi. Belief in al-Qadar is based on four things # ‚Äì Al-'Ilm ‚Äì Knowledge: i.e., that Allah knows what had been, what will be, what has never been, and how it could be if it was. He also knows what his creation will do, by virtue of His eternal knowledge, including their choices that will take place. # ‚Äì Kitabat ‚Äì Writing: i.e., that Allah has written every thing that exists including the destiny of all creatures in al-Lauh al-Mahfuz prior to creation. # ‚Äì Mashii'at ‚Äì Will: i.e., that what Allah wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. There is no movement in the heavens or on earth but happens by His will. This does not mean that He forces things to happen the way they happen in the area of human beings' voluntary actions. It means that He knew what they will choose, wrote it and now lets it happen. # ‚Äì Al-Khalq ‚Äì Creation and formation: i.e., that Allah is the Creator of all things, including the actions of His servants. They do their actions in a real sense, and Allah is the Creator of them and of their actions. Stages of Taqdeer (fate) There are five stages where Qadar is determined and prescribed/sent to creation: # The Decree of Allah that is written in Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuud before the creation of the universe. This destiny written in the preserved tablet is never changed and encompasses everything that will be. # Allah made a divine decree after the creation of Adam. Allah took out all of the progeny of Adam (i.e. all of the humans from the beginning of time until the end of time), and asked them \\"Am I not your Lord?\\" and all of the humans responded \\"We testify that You are our Lord!\\" Then Allah decreed to them who shall go to paradise and who shall go to hell. # The Life-time decree. This occurs when a person is in the womb of their mother, specifically 120 days after conception. Allah sends an angel to put a soul into the person, and the angel writes down the decree that Allah has made; their life-span, their actions, their sustenance (how much they will earn throughout their lifetime) and whether they will be a dweller of paradise or a dweller of hell.http://sunnah.com/nawawi40/4 # The yearly decree. This is during the Night of Qadr (Night of Decree) where Allah sends down his decrees from heaven to earth, in it he destines the actions (deeds, sustenance, births, deaths, etc.) of creation for the next year. The word Qadar should not be confused with Qadr; Qadar is destiny, Qadr is that which has been destined, i.e. decree, thus the translation ‚Äì Night of Decree. # The Daily Decree. Allah decrees the daily actions of his creation. An example of how these categorizations help clear the idea of destiny is as follows: It is possible that Allah sends a daily/yearly decree dictating that a person will get a profit. However, due to that person's good deeds (for instance, fulfilling the ties of kinship [being good to your relatives and maintaining the relationship]), Allah sends another decree increasing that person's profit. The reversal of the two decrees is all within Allah's knowledge and is recorded in the Preserved Tablet. The person himself knows nothing of his own destiny or of Allah's decrees, but what he does know is that if he performs certain good deeds, then He will increase his profit (as in the example above) more than if he does not do that deed. In the light of the above the following may be derived: * Our supplications do change destiny and are of much avail. * Good deeds are a source of an increase in one's sustenance, and can avert calamities. * Sins result in a decrease in one's sustenance, and invite calamities.  Shi'a view  Twelvers, along with other Shia sects such as the Zaydis, reject predestination.Need of Religion, by Sayyid Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi, p. 14.Islamic Beliefs, Practices, and Cultures, by Marshall Cavendish Corporation, p. 137.Religions of Man, by Charles Douglas Greer, p. 239.Muslims, by S. H. M. Rizvi, Shibani Roy, B. B. Dutta, p. 20. This belief is further emphasized by the Shia concept of Bada', which states that God has not set a definite course for human history. Instead, God may alter the course of human history as he sees fit. To show that there is no contradiction between being predestined, and free will, Shiites state that matters relating to human destiny are of two kinds: definite and indefinite. To explain the definitive one, Shiites argue that God has definite power over the whole of existence, however, so whenever He wills, He can replace a given destiny with another one; and that is what is called indefinite destiny. Some of these changes of destiny, thus, are brought about by man himself, who can through his free will, his decisions, and his way of life lay the groundwork for a change in his destiny as has been pointed out in the verse: Truly, God will not change the condition of a people as long as they do not change Their state themselves. Both types of destinies, however, are contained within God's foreknowledge, Shiites argue, so that there could be no sort of change (Bada) concerning His knowledge. So the first type of destiny does not mean a limitation of God's power; since God, in contrast to the belief of Jews who said the hand of God is tied‚Äô asserts: Nay, His hands are spread out wide .... So God has the power to change everything he wills and God's creativity is continuous. Accordingly, as Sobhani puts it, \\"all groups in Islam regard \\"bada\\" as a tenet of the faith, even if not all actually use the term.\\"  See also  * Qadariyah * Al-Qadr (surah) * Laylat al-Qadr * Will of God  Footnotes  References *  External links  *Concept of Qada and Qadar ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∂ÿßÿ° Ÿà ÿßŸÑŸÇÿØÿ± Category:Islamic terminology Category:Islamic theology Category:Destiny ","title":"Predestination in Islam"},{"id":"7211556","text":"The Volkswagen Polo Mk2 is the second generation of the Volkswagen Polo supermini. It was produced from late 1981 until 1994. It received a major facelift in 1990 and was available in three different body styles, including a distinctive \\"kammback\\"-styled hatchback. The sedan version received the name of Volkswagen Derby. Initial release Volkswagen Polo Volkswagen Polo Twist (hatchback) Volkswagen Derby sedan Interior (facelift model) A revised Polo model (known as the Mark 2 or Mark II, internally designated Typ 86C) was introduced in October 1981, with the major change being the introduction of a new body style with a steep (almost vertical) rear window, as well a version with a diagonal rear window and a similar profile to the previous model. These two body styles were called the Hatchback and Coup√© respectively, although in fact both were three-door hatchbacks. The latter was added to the range in 1983 as the radical styling of the original design was not welcomed by all. The Coup√© was originally only available with the more powerful engines (55 and 75 PS), but after a mild facelift in August 1984 the base unit was also made available. The sedan version was no longer called the Derby in all countries, and was changed to the Polo Classic on all markets from 1984. Production was expanded to Spain following Volkswagen's takeover of SEAT in 1986. The hatchback was the lightest bodystyle, lighter than the coup√© and lighter than the three-box sedan. 1093 cc or 1272 cc engines were available at launch. In 1986, the Polo received numerous technical improvements; amongst many other minor updates, the engines were changed to lower maintenance hydraulic tappets, new camshafts and valve gear and an automatic choke; the 1043 cc engine replaced the 1093 cc, and in some markets the 1.3-litre engine was available with fuel injection and equipped with a catalytic converter. In 1984 an all-new 1.3-litre engine was introduced, which was used in various generations of Polo until 1996. The Polo received some changes in August 1984, including a new dashboard, a bigger fuel tank, and more standard equipment. The GL was discontinued with the CL essentially taking its place. All models now received round rather than the earlier square headlights. These changes helped keep the Polo remain competitive in an increasingly competitive market, which had seen the arrival of the Opel Corsa (Vauxhall Nova in the UK) during 1982, and of three more all-new competitors - the Fiat Uno, Nissan Micra and Peugeot 205 - in 1983, as well as an updated Ford Fiesta in the same year and the new Renault 5 a year later. By the time an all-new Fiesta was launched in early 1989, the Polo was the only popular European supermini to lack a four- or five-door version, and had also gained a new competitor, the Citroen AX, which was also available with five doors by the end of the decade. Available with the 1093 cc engine the Coup√© featured additions such as sporting seats trim, wheel arch extensions, rear spoiler, low profile tyres and a rev counter, as well as the round headlights which were later fitted across the range. The GL featured a 60 PS (44 kW) engine. In August 1982, for the 1983 model year, the first sporty Polo was introduced. The Polo Coup√© GT received a 75 PS (55 kW) version of the 1.3-liter engine, as well as servo assisted brakes, twin headlights, a digital clock, sports seats, and a rev counter. The extra power (up by 25 percent) was the result of dished pistons containing the compression chambers, allowing for a flat cylinder head, providing higher and more even compression. While commonly referred to as a Heron head, Volkswagen called the design \\"HCS\\", for High Compression and Squish. The carburettor remained a twin-barrel one, and the only transmission at the time of introduction was a very long-geared four-speed manual. Other special models were introduced over the rest of the period of the Mark 2 production run including models such as the Twist, Parade and Country. The UK market only ever received the 1.0, 1.1 and 1.3 versions of the Polo, but it was still one of the most popular imported cars there, frequently managing over 30,000 sales per year and peaking as the 11th best selling car there in 1983.  Polo G40  Polo Mk2 GT G40 The Mark 2 Polo was used extensively by Volkswagen to develop future innovations, for example supercharging. The supercharger- equipped GT G40 version was introduced in 1987, in LHD Coupe form only, first as a limited batch of about 500 cars, most of which were sold to VW workers (as a homologated version of the car for the G40 Cup race series) and later as a normal production version. This model featured the 1272 cc engine with a small bore G-Lader supercharger, giving at 6000 rpm, as well as modified suspension and the bodywork of the \\"normal\\" GT Coup√©. The car could reach in 8.1 secs from and had maximum speed of it was used by VW to set a number of world endurance speed records ‚Äî such as the 1300 cc class records for speed over 24 hours and speed over a distance of 5000 km. A G-Lader would later be used on the larger and more technically challenging G60 engine used in the Golf and Corrado. An extremely fuel-efficient two-cylinder diesel was prototyped in the mid-1980s with a G40 supercharger to overcome its small capacity, although this did not make production. A high-fuel-efficiency model which did make production was Formel E (E for Economy), introduced in 1983. This used a high-compression 1272 cc engine, longer gear ratios and an early- stop-start ignition system (called SSA) that would cut the engine when idle for more than two seconds to save fuel whilst temporarily stopped in traffic, and restart the engine when the gear lever was moved to the left in neutral. The system could be enabled or disabled by means of a toggle switch below the light switch. Similar systems were later used on the Volkswagen Golf Mk3. Similar systems were developed by other car manufacturers. Engines The Mark 2 was available with the following engines: * 1,093 cc straight-4 petrol (1981‚Äì1983) * 1,272 cc straight-4 petrol (1981‚Äì1994) * 1,043 cc straight-4 petrol (1983‚Äì1994) * 1,272 cc straight-4 petrol with a Pierburg 2E3 carburettor producing (1983‚Äì1990). Coupe S in UK, GT elsewhere in Europe * 1.272 cc straight-4 petrol with multi-point fuel injection and equipped with a catalytic converter producing (1991‚Äì1994). GT version only. * 1,272 cc straight-4 supercharged petrol with . (GT G40 version 1987 only) * 1,272 cc straight-4 diesel (1986‚Äì1990) * 1,398 straight-4 diesel (August 1990 ‚Äì 1994) Trim levels The VW Polo was available in six trim levels; * Fox (1.0, 1.3 petrol, 1.3 diesel), from August 1984 * C (1.0, 1.1 petrol, 1.3 diesel) * CL (1.0, 1.1, 1.3 petrol, 1.3 diesel) * GL (1.1, 1.3 petrol, 1.3 diesel) * GT (1.3 petrol) * S (1.3 petrol) * CX (1.0 petrol) For the 1985 model year, the GL was dropped and the bargain limited edition \\"Fox\\" model was introduced in some markets. In the UK, the spartanly equipped Fox arrived in 1987, available only with a 1.0-litre engine. It was also sold with the 1.3 and as a diesel version in Europe. However, neither the 1.3 petrol nor the diesel engines were available in the UK. Otherwise, versions sold on the Continent were similar to their UK counterparts; this was the same for all Polo Mark 2 versions up to the launch of an all-new Polo in 1994. Facelift model 1990 facelift 1990 facelift A facelift in October 1990, for the 1991 model year, (referred to unofficially as the Mark 2F or IIF) saw square headlights, bigger bumpers and a new interior (dash and door trim). The three different styles (hatchback, coup√© hatchback and sedan) were maintained. The aerodynamics were improved by about ten percent; this was in part thanks to the new, more rounded front end, but other details such as the glued-in rear windshields on coup√©s and hatchbacks also had an impact. As well as the cosmetic differences, under the skin the car received modifications to the chassis and suspension as well as the addition of servo-assisted brakes to all models including right hand drive versions. The new Polo mostly kept the same four-cylinder engine but now as well as the carburetted 1.0 L, fuel injection models were available with single-point injection, and all engines came standard with a catalytic converter to combat tightening EU laws on automobile emissions. Carburetted models remained available for markets where unleaded fuel was harder to obtain or emissions were not prioritized. The carburetted Polo GT had a little bit more power, at 6100 rpm. The erstwhile Derby, now sold as the Polo Classic, was only produced in Spain, and ceased production in 1992. At this point, the Polo was now terminally dated. The follow-up model, the Mark 3 or Typ 6N version, was already well developed, but due to the high sales numbers, production of the other Polo models (hatchback and Coup√©) was continued to 1994 in Wolfsburg and Spain. Volkswagen used the extra two years to restudy the Typ 6N and change the format slightly before introduction in 1994. Soon after the launch of the Mark 2F, another sporting model was added to the range ‚Äî a new version of the supercharged G40, now as a full production model in all markets rather than the limited batch of Mark 2 G40s. The engine used a slightly different version of the digifant injection system to allow the use of a catalytic converter, and produced 113 PS (83 kW), which gave 0‚Äì100 km/h figures of 8.6 seconds and a top speed of . The car was lowered by over the standard Polo and featuring special edition Le Mans sports seats, similar exterior styling to the GT with the addition of a bee sting aerial and 5.5J X 13\\" BBS RA cross spoke alloy wheels. As with the previous model, VW Motorsport modified G40 Cup cars were sold for racing in a one-make series, the Volkswagen Polo G40 Cup. The reliability of these vehicles was hampered by early production mistakes and high maintenance costs ‚Äî parts of the G-Lader can wear out quickly if unmaintained ‚Äî which damaged the reputation of the supercharging concept. Volkswagen ended its experimentation with supercharged hot hatches at the end of the Polo 2F production run, due to high manufacturing costs and less than enthusiastic sales. The price was little less than that of the basic Golf GTI. In 1992 VW released a limited number of special edition Polos, with special trim and a G40 engine and suspension. The \\"Genesis\\" G40 was made to special order only. A single right hand drive example found its way to the UK. This one-off model was a competition prize when the VW-sponsored Genesis tour reached its UK leg. Trim levels Trim levels were Fox, CL, GL, Boulevard and Genesis. The Fox was the entry-level model, only available with a 1.0-litre engine, but in Europe it had a 1.3-litre version. The very spartan Fox did not even receive side marker lights as standard.

It was produced from 1975 until 1981. Polo Mark 1 (1975-1979) The original Polo (known internally as the Typ 86), a rebadged version of the Audi 50, was introduced in 1975 on mainland Europe and was launched in the UK and the Isle of Man in 1976. The differences between the Audi and VW models were minor, with the Polo being cheaper and much more basic. The two cars were initially sold alongside each other, but the Audi 50 never sold as well, and was withdrawn in 1978. The manufacturer let it be known that Bertone had been involved in the styling of the Polo and its Audi sibling, although the car was essentially an in-house Audi design, with the Italian design studio's contribution restricted to the circular extractor vent cover at the base of the C pillar, and the small \\"flick-up\\" at the rear end of the waist line. The Polo was manufactured at the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg. In 1977, the Derby sedan was released, which was simply a Polo, identical to the hatchback from the C-pillar forward, with a large boot attached (an old Audi proposal, but never sold by this brand). When first on sale the range topping car, the LS model, featured the 50 PS (37 kW) 1043 cc engine found in the Audi 50. Other specifications included parking lights, rear wash wipe, sun visors, chromed bumpers and 4.5J X 13\\" wheels. The N model was the basic starting spec lacking many of the features of the LS. In 1979 the GLS was introduced, replacing the LS as the range-topping car; specification upgrades included chrome headlight and grill surrounds, sunroof, a cigarette lighter and chrome wheel trims. 895 cc, producing , 1093 cc, and 1272 cc engines were used, with the smaller one used only in the Polo hatchback, and the 1272 cc only in the Derby, Audi 50, and the rare Polo GT. Different levels of compression were used on each size to achieve different power outputs, and the variations are numerous, often differing depending on the country of sale, ranging from 34 to 60 PS (26 to 44 kW). For Sweden and certain other markets a version with a 771 cc engine was developed for the 1976 model year, as new very strict emissions regulations were introduced but did not apply to engines of less than . The Swedish model was discontinued after 1977, as sales of the underpowered car were sluggish, but the HE engine option continued to be mentioned in period journals (also for the Derby) until the Mark I was replaced in 1981..  Powertrain  The Polo Mk1 was available with the following engines: * 895 cc, straight 4 petrol (hatchback only) * 1,093 cc straight 4 petrol, * 1,272 cc, straight 4 petrol, (Polo GT, Derby sedan models, Audi 50 only) Different levels of compression were used on each size to achieve different power outputs, and the variations are numerous, often differing depending on the country of sale, ranging from . Polo Mark 1 facelift (1979-1981) The Mark 1 Polo and Derby were facelifted in 1979 (unofficially referred to as the Mark 1F) with plastic bumpers, a different front grille and a revised dashboard. They were first shown in February 1979 at the Amsterdam Motor Show. The round headlights of the Derby were replaced with square ones, bringing it inline with the similar Golf-based Jetta sedan. Further models were added including CLS, S and a run-out LX model. The Mark 1's production run finally ended in October 1981 with over 500,000 Polos sold worldwide.

When not competing for Ireland as a member of the Gaelic Athletic Association, Daly entered races as a member of the Irish American Athletic Club. Biography Daly competed in the 2590 metre steeplechase at the 1904 Summer Olympics held in St Louis, United States and won the silver medal. Although officially representing Great Britain, Daly saw himself as an individual representing Ireland. After the Olympics Daily stayed in North America for two years, and later in 1904 won the Canadian mile and two-mile championships. In 1906 Daly and two other athletes, Con Leahy and Peter O'Connor, were entered for the Intercalated Games in Athens by the IAAA and GAA, representing Ireland. They were given green blazers and caps with a gold shamrock, and an Irish flag (the Erin Go Bragh flag). However, the rules of the games were changed so that only athletes nominated by National Olympic Committees were eligible. Ireland did not have an Olympic Committee, and the British Olympic Council claimed the three as their own. In what became the first political protest in modern Olympic history, O'Connor, who came second in the long jump, scaled the flagpole, and removed the Union flag, replacing it with a green flag. Daly stood guard at the bottom of the pole, while Irish and American fans kept security guards at bay. At those Games Daly finished third in the 5 mile competition, but was disqualified for obstructing Edward Dahl. He abandoned his marathon race after 18 miles due to blisters and an ankle injury, which resulted in a three-day hospitalisation. After 1906 Daly mostly raced in the United States, where he later became a successful New York businessman. He was selected to compete for Great Britain and Ireland at the London 1908 Olympics, but did not compete. In 1907 he enjoyed his greatest successes, winning the 5 mile and 10 mile U.S. A.A.U. titles and the Canadian 3 mile title.\\"DALY WINS RUN AT CELTIC PARK; Irish-American Athlete Captures Three-Mile Event at Firemen's Games.\\" New York Times, 26 August 1907\\"DALY EASY WINNER IN TEN MILE RUN; Irish-American A.C.

It is a non-profit organization headquartered in Quebec City.  History  CAA-Quebec's earliest predecessor was the Automobile Club of Canada founded by Andrew J. Dawes in 1904. Its first meeting was held on 28 July 1904 at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal, Canada. On 9 August 1912, Frank Carrel founded the Quebec Automobile Club in Quebec. Advocacy started from the beginning: members of the Quebec Automobile Club were already lobbying the government for better infrastructure to sustain their new cars. In 1922, the Quebec Automobile Clubs started offering roadside assistance to its members, and the following year the Montreal club started the same service. In 1950, the Automobile Club of Canada's main demand was a road crossing the island of Montreal. This continuing demand paid off, but only at the end of the decade, with the building of the boulevard M√©tropolitain. The two clubs of the province began their affiliation with the American Automobile Association (AAA) respectively in 1940 for the Quebec City club and in 1953 for the Montreal club. This marked the beginning of Trip Tiks (customized planned routes) for members of the Quebec clubs. The two clubs merged into one entity, the Automobile and Touring club of Quebec, in 1984 and later adopted the brand name CAA-Quebec. In 2004, it celebrated its 100th year of existence.  Locations  CAA-Quebec has branches in most major Quebec cities, including Chicoutimi, Gatineau, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivieres, Quebec City, Montreal and Laval. These locations offer services including travel services and membership services (Trip Tiks, Tour Books, etc.)  Roadside assistance  All service calls are received at the Montreal Contact Centre where call takers enter the information regarding the breakdown into a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) software. Calls are then sent either to the Montreal dispatch centre (it covers the island of Montreal, Laval, the north shore and the south shore) or to the Quebec City dispatch centre (it covers everywhere Montreal dispatch does not).

The family traces its roots to the 14th century (a semi-legendary Bushka (Lithuanian sources: Bu≈°ka, Polish sources: Buszka) is considered the ancestor of the family). Their seat was in the Samogitia and Trakai regions. Kƒôsgailos family members had been the Elders of Samogitia from 1412 until 1532.

Vilnius, 2005. p. 182 The family died out in the 16th century. Name The surname Kƒôsgaila comes from the native first name of Mykolas Kƒôsgaila (son of Valimantas, son of Bushka) whose elder brother Jaunutis son of Valimantas was granted the Zadora coat of arms in the Union of Horod≈Ço of 1413. In line with the common practice for nobles' names after the Christianization of Lithuania, after his baptism, the Christian name *Mƒ´kƒÅlas (Michael) was added to a pagan Lithuanian name, which can be reconstructed as *Kensgaƒ≠la (from kƒôsti (\\"be patient\\") and gailas (\\"strong\\")). His son Jonas Kƒôsgailaitis, mentioned in written sources in Latin as Johannes Kyensgalowicz,Historical Documents of Lithuania was a bearer of the name as a patronymic, which subsequently evolved into a family name.

After lunch is over, the miners all return to work (and reapply their dirt and grime before entering the mine). An excited Bimbo runs around, singing \\"I Heard\\", and calls Betty to come down into the mine. She takes the dumbwaiter down, but the cable snaps and plunges to the bottom. The crash leaves her unhurt, but clad only in her lingerie (Bimbo obligingly returns her dress). The two discover a team of ghosts playing a game of baseball, with a cartoon bomb as the ball. Bimbo and Betty head to the surface in the elevator, unwittingly carrying the bomb with them. They send it back down, and the resultant explosion fills all the railroad cars with coal.

His sons used Kƒôsgaila as their last name. (died ca. 1450) was a Lithuanian nobleman from Deltuva. He established the Kƒôsgailos family in Samogitia, where their power rivaled that of the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Mykolas Kƒôsgaila was the deputy of Ukmergƒó (1409‚Äì1412), Elder of Samogitia (1412‚Äì32, 1440‚Äì41, and 1443‚Äì50), and castellan of Vilnius (1443‚Äì1448). He was a father of Jonas Kƒôsgaila and Mykolas Kƒôsgaila the Younger. Mykolas, son of Valimantas, was first mentioned in the Pact of Vilnius and Radom of 1401. He was a strong supporter of Grand Duke Vytautas, who awarded the loyal ally with the seat of Elder of Samogitia as Mykolas' mother was of Samogitian stock. Mykolas presided over Christianization of Samogitia in 1413, subdued a peasant rebellion in 1418, and foiled a plot by nobles against Vytautas in 1419. In 1430, after the death of Vytautas, Mykolas Kƒôsgaila and his brothers Rumbaudas and Jaunius Valimantaitis supported the accession of ≈†vitrigaila to the Lithuanian throne.

After Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis seized power, Mykolas and his brothers were imprisoned. Rumbaudas and Jaunius were executed, while Mykolas managed to restore his power and domains. Possibly, such an outcome was influenced by Mykolas' daughter, the wife of Sigismund's influential ally Jonas Go≈°tautas. Mykolas witnessed the Union of Grodno of 1432 between Sigismund and Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, King of Poland. According to the Bychowiec Chronicle, after the murder of Sigismund in 1440, Mykolas was among supporters of Casimir IV Jagiellon for the throne of Grand Duke. For such support, he was reinstated as Elder of Samogitia, but the Samogitians did not want to recognize Casimir's authority. As a compromise, Casimir granted a privilege affirming semi-autonomic status of the region and granting new freedoms to the nobles. Mykolas was able to return to the office.

The album is separated from the band's other albums because of its electronic sound, machined-style rhythm, and particular cover. The album was completed with the same people as in Invisible, but just before the release, Rodrigo Aboitiz left the band due to a drug problem. The quartet then split with Luciano Rojas for good when he left in the middle of the tour.  Background and reception  Due to the success of Invisible, the band hardly found time to record what would be their next album. However, in 1997 they began recording and announced the album's release date for the middle of that summer, but it was later delayed until 1998. During this time, Rodrigo Aboitiz (the band's keyboardist) caused a series of troubles, missing the first weeks of recording. After the album was finished, he left the band. One month before the release of the album, the first single, \\"Fotofobia\\", was released and slashed by critics. After that, the album \\"V√©rtigo\\" was released and brought the least success of all the band's albums. According to the band members, they had high expectations about it, but it was proven to be a failure in comparison to Invisible. The album was notorious for its electric and machine-style sounds that surprised and outraged most of the fans. Still, the album sold fairly well, as it sold 100,000 copies in Mexico. The band released two more singles \\"Vi\\" (the album's best known song), whose video was banned from MTV for the use of guns, and the much less notorious \\"Tanta Ciudad\\". They also released the single \\"Sed\\", which did not have a video and was only played by a few radio stations. In the middle of the tour, bassist Luciano Rojas, was nowhere to be found. He was replaced by J.C. Cumplido, who had to learn the songs in less than five minutes before the beginning of the first concert. Later, though fans thought the band was breaking up completely, Luciano simply left the band, making La Ley a trio. After the end of the tour in 1999, La Ley dropped their dark-style image and began working on their album, Uno. Though the album did not well do with sales and is often considered by many their worst record, the album's prestige has grown considerably. Some fans now consider it their best album for having such an unusual sound and a different, more experimental, style. The songs \\"Ciclos\\" and \\"Vi\\" are considered by many the best songs of the album.  \\"V√≠\\" controversy  The music video for \\"V√≠\\", directed by Argentinian Stanley, was banned from MTV Latin America because of the use of guns. This was a big shock for the band, since MTV was its biggest promoter. It also affected the sales of the record, being the first single released (although \\"Fotofobia\\" was the debut single of V√©rtigo, it was more like a preview of the album released several months before).

He was born in Huron County, Ontario, Canada in 1876.Clara Thomas, Canadian Novelists, 1920-1945. Toronto, Longmans, Green & Company, 1946. (p. 100) He wrote 'commercial fiction' under the pseudonym Frank L Pollock and literary fiction under his own name. Some of Pollock's early commercial fiction can be found in The Youth's Companion. He also regularly published short stories and poetry in Munsey's Magazine, The Smart Set, The Atlantic, The Bookman (New York) and The Blue Jay (renamed in 1905 as Canadian Woman Magazine). The sale of a serialised novel, The Treasure Trail, enabled him to leave his job at the Toronto Mail and Empire in 1907 to pursue a full-time writing career. Pollock's writing career was pursued in tandem with a life of beekeeping. Many of his fictions are influenced by bees. Pollock kept an apiary in Shedden, Ontario and farmed commercially. He and his second wife, Zella Taylor retired to Georgetown, Ontario. Pollock is the author of the short story \\"Finis\\", published in the June 1906 issue of The Argosy magazine, and his work has been anthologized several times. Briefly, \\"Finis\\" is the story of a new star that is discovered which turns out to be a new, hotter sun. It is a short hard hitting story which shows a man and woman, who stay up the night to watch the expected new star arise. Though written in 1906, it is set in the future of the mid 20th century.

The name comes from the noise made by some versions of the boats. Other names are putt- putt boat, crazy boat, flash-steamer, hot-air-boat, pulsating water engine boat. Around the world they may be called Can-Can-boot, Knatterboot, toc-toc, Puf-Puf boat, Poof Poof craft, Phut-Phut, or Pouet-Pouet.Basil Harley, Toyshop Steam, (Argus Books, 1978).  Construction  A home-made pop pop boat using a coil type boiler Commercial pop pop boats have usually been made out of tinplate. The hull of the boat may be made out of any material that floats. Homemade pop pop boats are often made out of wood. The boat's engine consists of a boiler and one or more exhaust tubes. While a single exhaust tube may be used, two exhaust tubes are much more commonly used. This is because the boiler and the exhaust tubes have to be filled with water, and using two tubes allows water to be injected into one tube while air inside the engine escapes through the other tube. It is more difficult to remove the air and completely fill single exhaust tube types. The boiler and exhaust tubes are usually made out of metal, with tin or copper being common. Boiler designs vary. Simple metal containers in the shape of a box or cylinder are common. A more efficient boiler can be made by using a metal pan whose top is a slightly concave diaphragm made out of a very thin, springy metal. Many pop pop boats have used a single tube of metal, which is formed into a coil in its center and left straight on both ends to form the exhausts. The coil in this version functions as the boiler. A heating element of some sort is placed under the boiler. Candles or small oil burners are commonly used.  History  Pop-pop engine design, from a patent application filed by Thomas Piot in 1891. The diaphragm type engine, from a patent application filed by Paul Jones in 1934. Coil type engine, from a patent application filed by William Purcell in 1920. Credit for the first pop pop boat is usually given to a Frenchman named Thomas Piot. In 1891, Piot filed a patent application in the UK for a simple pop pop boat using a small boiler and two exhaust tubes.Thomas Piot UK Patent 20,081 \\"Improvement in steam generators\\" Issue date: 0ct. 15, 1892Ed Sobey and Woody Sobey, \\"The Way Toys Work\\" (Chicago Review Press, 2008), p. 100. A 1975 article by Basil Harley mentions a similar boat seen in a French journal from 1880, indicating that this type of toy may have existed for many years prior to Piot's patent. In 1915, an American named Charles J. McHugh filed a patent application for the diaphragm type of engine, which was an improvement to Piot's design.Charles J. McHugh \\"Power-propelled boat\\", Issue date: Oct 10, 1916 In 1920, William Purcell filed a patent for the coiled tube type of engine.W. F. Purcell \\"Propelling device\\", Issue date: Jan 15, 1924 This type of engine has been very common over the years in homemade pop pop boats, due to its simplicity of construction. The Cub Scout book (published by the Boy Scouts of America) contained a project called a \\"Jet Boat\\" for many years. This project used a coil type of engine based on Purcell's design which was placed in a wooden hull. Many commercial pop pop boats have also used this type of engine, due to its low cost. McHugh filed for another patent in 1926. This was again a diaphragm engine design, refined so that it could be more easily fabricated commercially.Charles J. McHugh \\"Power propelled boat\\", Issue date: Aug 24, 1926 In 1934, Paul Jones filed a patent for another diaphragm design which could be produced industrially from simple stamped parts.Paul Jones \\"Tot boat\\", Issue date: Mar 5, 1935 Many pop pop boats produced in the 1920s had a single exhaust pipe. Designs using two exhaust pipes are easier to fill, and have been much more common over the years. Pop pop boats were popular for many years, especially in the 1940s and 1950s. Pop pop boats declined in popularity along with other tin toys in the latter half of the 20th century as plastic toys took over much of the market. While they are no longer produced in such large numbers, pop pop boats continue to be produced. These toys have come in many varieties over the years. Some have been very simple and inexpensive, while others have been much more ornate and artistic. As with many toys, pop pop boats are often sought by collectors, and the prices paid vary depending on rarity and design. The pop pop boat featured prominently in the 2008 Japanese animated fantasy film Ponyo.\\"A surprise sighting\\" from the Pop-Pop Pages, by Vance Bass Toy boats with a diaphragm type engine, like the one shown in the film, were produced and sold as a tie- in when the movie was released.Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea Sousuke's Ponpon Ship, from Hobby Search.  Principle of operation  Animation showing the working cycle of the engine in a pop-pop boat A pop pop boat is powered by a very simple heat engine. This engine consists of a small boiler, which is connected to an exhaust tube. When heat is applied to the boiler, water in the boiler evaporates, producing steam. The expanding steam is suddenly pushed out of the boiler, making a 'pop' sound, and pushes some of the water out of the exhaust tube, propelling the boat forward. The boiler is now dry, and can therefore not generate any more steam. The momentum of the column of water in the exhaust tube keeps it moving outward, so that the pressure inside the boiler drops below atmospheric pressure. In the case of a diaphragm type engine, the boiler also bulges inward at this point, also making popping sound. The pressure outside the boiler now forces water back into the boiler. This water then boils and the cycle repeats. The popping noise is more pronounced when a diaphragm-type boiler is used: coil-type boilers are much quieter. Any air in the boiler can act as a spring and support the oscillation of the water, but if too much air enters the boiler, the oscillation will stop because all the water has been displaced, and no steam can be generated. Water contains some dissolved air, which can build up in the engine during operation. Therefore, engines must \\"burp\\" out air periodically in order to run for a long time. In pop pop boats with two exhaust tubes, the water is expelled from both tubes during the first phase of the cycle, and drawn in from both tubes during the second phase of the cycle. The water does not circulate in through one tube and out through the other. The internal- combustion analog of the pop pop boat engine is the valveless pulse jet. Pop pop boat with accessories. (Melted candle in the 'pan' with a lit piece of wick provides the heat source) The operation of the pop pop boat may seem surprising, since one might expect that if water is going in and out through the exhaust tube, the boat should merely shake back and forth. But while the water pushed out carries away with it momentum, which must be balanced (by Newton's third law) by an opposite momentum on the part of the boat, the water sucked in quickly impinges on the boiler tank and transfers its momentum to the boat. The initial reaction force on the boat (which would pull it backwards) is therefore cancelled by the pushing of the water when it hits the inside of the boiler. The result is that the inflow of water causes no appreciable force on the boat. Some authors have argued that the reason why the pop pop boat works is that the water being propelled out the back of the boat forms a narrow jet, while the water being drawn back in on the second half of the cycle is drawn in from all directions.Neil A. Downie, Ink Sandwiches, Electric Worms, and 37 Other Experiments for Saturday Science, (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003), p. 74 Jearl Walker, The Flying Circus of Physics, (Wiley, 2006), pp. 199‚Äì200 This asymmetry may be seen as well in the way in which one blows out a candle: it is easy to extinguish a candle by blowing on it, since all of the air expelled is moving in a concentrated, directional jet. However, it is difficult to put out the flame by sucking in air, the air being sucked in comes from all directions.Eb Sobey and Woody Sobey, The Way Toys Work, (Chicago Review Press, 2008), pp. 101‚Äì102. This observation, though correct, may be misleading as an explanation of why the pop pop boat moves forward. The asymmetry of the shapes of the inflow and the outflow is a consequence of the viscosity of water, whereas the boat would be able to operate in an ideal fluid. Furthermore, as they pass through the exhausts, the inflowing and the outflowing water carry the same momentum (in opposite directions), relative to the boat. The important difference is that the momentum of the outflow is expelled, whereas the momentum of the inflow is soon transferred to the boat. The sucking/blowing asymmetry does make the boat more efficient, even if it's not the principle on which it operates. The physics of the operation of the pop pop boat is very similar to that of the \\"Feynman sprinkler,\\" a submerged sprinkler which is seen to turn weakly or not at all as water is sucked in through it. In both cases, the reaction force on the solid device caused by the sucking in of the fluid is balanced by the fluid impinging on the inside of the device.

As sire, he had a major influence on pedigrees around the world. Blenheim was highly tried, by European standards, as a two-year-old in 1929, winning four of his seven races. In the following season he was beaten in his first two races before recording an upset 18/1 win in the Derby. His racing career was ended by injury soon afterwards, and he was retired to stud, where he became an extremely successful and influential breeding stallion, both in Europe and North America. Background Blenheim was a brown horse standing 15.3 hands high with a white star and a white sock on his left hind leg, bred by Henry Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon at his Highclere stud. He was sired by the good sire Blandford, a three-time British champion sire, whose other progeny included Bahram, Brantome, Trigo, Pasch and Windsor Lad. Blenheim's dam, Malva (1919‚Äì1941) who stood barely 15 hands, won three minor races for Lord Carnarvon before becoming a highly successful broodmare. She was the dam of seven winners, including the Coronation Cup winners King Salmon (sire of Herringbone) and His Grace. As a yearling, Blenheim was sold for 4,100 guineas to the Aga Khan. He was sent into training with Richard Dawson at his Whatcombe stables near Wantage in Oxfordshire. Race record 1929: two-year-old season Blenheim began his racing career in April 1929 when he won a ¬£200 plate at Newbury Racecourse. He then finished second in the Stud Produce Stakes at Sandown and won the Speedy Plate at Windsor. He was then moved up in class to contest the New Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Dawson's stable jockey Michael Beary he started at odds of 7/2 and won from Lord Woolavington's Press Gang. In autumn he finished second to Fair Diana in the Champagne Stakes and then won the Hopeful Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. On his final race of the season he started favourite for the Middle Park Stakes but finished second by half a length to Press Gang. It was noted that Blenheim may have been feeling the effects of his \\"punishing\\" schedule. He ended the season with earnings of ¬£4,497. 1930: three-year-old season Blenheim was slow to find his form as a three-year-old and began his 1930 campaign by running unplaced behind Christopher Robin in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury. Despite his poor performance in the trial, he was well-fancied for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket two weeks later. He finished fourth of the twenty-eight runners behind Diolite, Paradine and Silver Flare. A month later, Blenheim was moved up in distance to contest the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. Beary elected to ride the Aga Khan's more fancied runner Rustom Pasha, while the ride on Blenheim went to Harry Wragg, a jockey whose expertise at holding up horses for a late run had earned him the nickname \\"The Head Waiter\\". The race attracted its customary huge crowd, with the spectators including the King and Queen as well as the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. Blenheim started an 18/1 outsider in a field of seventeen. Rustom Pasha led the field on the final turn but weakened and dropped away in the straight. Blenheim was produced by Wragg with a perfectly timed run to take the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from Iliad with Diolite in third. After the race Wragg described the winner as \\"a lovely little horse\\" and explained that although he had only made very gradual progress in the second half of the race he had always been confident of victory. After the Derby, Blenheim was being prepared or a run in the Eclipse Stakes when he sustained a tendon injury. He did not recover sufficiently to resume racing and was retired to stud.Ahnert, Rainer L. (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Blenheim an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù Derby winner. Stud record He entered stud in 1932Pryor, Peter, The Classic Connection, Cortney Publications, Luton, 1979 at the Aga Khan's Haras Marly-la-Ville in Val-d'Oise, France, where he stood at a fee of 400 guineas. In his first crop of foals, he sired Mumtaz Begum (bred eight winners, including Nasrullah), followed the next year by Mahmoud, who won the 1936 Epsom Derby. His next crop of foals included Donatello, one of Federico Tesio‚Äôs best horses who sired Crepello and Alycidon.Leicester, Sir Charles, Bloodstock Breeding, J.A. Allen & Co, London, 1969 He was sold after that year's breeding season for ¬£45,000 to an American syndicate that included Claiborne Farm, Calumet Farm, Greentree Farm and Stoner Creek Stud before being exported to America in 1936 where he was known as Blenheim II. In America he sired the 1941 U.S. Triple Crown champion, Whirlaway and Jet Pilot, who won the 1947 Kentucky Derby and $198,740. Blenheim was also the damsire of Hill Gail, Mark-Ye-Well, Kauai King, Ponder and Le Paillon. Blenheim was American Champion sire in 1941.

In 1494, he signed a peace agreement with the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The treaty was reinforced with engagement of Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon and Helena, daughter of Ivan III. As the groom was away in Lithuania, his role was performed by Kƒôsgaila. At the start of the Russo- Lithuanian war of 1500‚Äì1503, Lithuanians suffered a major defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha. Great Hetman (army commander) Konstanty Ostrogski was captured and was replaced by Semyon Olshanski who had gained military experience during the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1485‚Äì1503). But Olshanski was quickly replaced by Kƒôsgaila who had no prior military experience. Such appointment is difficult to explain, but possibly it was a result of diplomatic negotiations that ended in a military alliance with the Livonian Order. Kƒôsgaila brought Lithuanian army to help the besieged Mstislavl and Smolensk, but in both cases the Russians retreated without a fight. He was replaced as Great Hetman by Stanis≈Çaw Kiszka who distinguished himself in organizing Smolensk's defense.

By 2020, the total volume of cargo shipped by water is expected to be double that of 2000 volumes. American ports are responsible for moving over 99 percent of the country's overseas cargo. U.S. ports handle a wide variety of goods that are critical to the global economy, including petroleum, grain, steel, automobiles, and containerized goods. Reports from individual ports indicate that approximately 4.6 million automobiles (imports and exports) passed through American ports in 2006.  Employment  In addition to handling goods from all over the world, U.S. ports play a key role in creating jobs. For every $1 billion in exports about 15,000 port jobs are created. The figure swells to 30,000-45,000 when taking into account jobs to support new products and personnel. Total port-related employment in the United States was estimated at 8.4 million people in 2006. Of this total, 1.4 million were employed in providing goods and services to ports (such as longshore, stevedore, and security personnel). The remaining 7 million were employed in import- and export-related activities (such as transportation, warehousing, and distribution). Port activities were also responsible for bringing in $102.8 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2006.  Growth  As more American businesses engage in international trade, ports will continue to grow. The majority of export companies in the United States are small businesses. American workers producing for export earned 15 percent higher wages and received 11 percent higher benefits than employees in non-exporting companies. Unusually, United States containerized trade rates fell in 2007 despite a continued rise in international container rates. Inbound container volumes to the United States fell by 1.1 percent in 2007 to 18.96 million TEU. This compares to growth rates of 8.6 percent in 2006 and 10.5 percent in 2005.

The elder was left with 8 volosts (Karklƒónai, Kra≈æiai, Medingƒónai, Patum≈°iai, Pavandenƒó, Tend≈æiogala, Viduklƒó and ≈Ωarƒónai) that had only about 10% of the Samogitian population. After early death of Stanislovas, the office of the Elder of Samogitia was assigned to Piotr Kiszka, not a member of the Kƒôsgailos family for the first time in more than a century. Stanislovas' last will left about a third of his possessions to the Grand Duke, who then transferred the towns to his wife Bona Sforza. Subsequently the family faded from the public life.

Betty's farm is a sanctuary for birds, but the sanctuary is soon threatened by the arrival of the Tom Kat's Social Club, a group of hungry cats looking for an easy meal. They chase a helpless chick back to Betty's farm, who alerts Betty to the danger. The cats initially wreak destruction on the farm, and easily overpower Betty. When the sickly rooster finds out what's happening, he quickly turns into a fighter (boxing gloves and all), and pummels the cats. The other birds join in on the beating, and chase away the hapless cats. The rooster defeats the cat's leader and Betty declares him the winner.

Both Russian officials and Chechen rebels have been regularly and repeatedly accused of committing various war crimes, including kidnapping, torture, murder, hostage taking, looting, rape, beheading and assorted other breaches of the law of war. International and humanitarian organizations, including the Council of Europe and Amnesty International, have criticized both sides of the conflict for blatant and sustained violations of international humanitarian law. Crimes Forced disappearances Human rights campaigners estimate that since September 1999 - the start of the second Chechen conflict - as many as 5,000 people have disappeared and are feared dead. According to Amnesty International in 2005, Russian officials give about 2,000 as the official figure for \\"disappearances\\" since late 1999. * In March 2001 Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued the report titled The \\"Dirty War\\" in Chechnya, which called the \\"disappearances\\" of detainees in the custody of Russian federal forces in Chechnya a major human rights crisis that the international community must address. * On March 31, 2003, Akhmad Kadyrov, the head of the pro-Moscow administration of the Chechen Republic, has suggested that Russian federal forces are behind breaking into homes at night and abducting people. \\"People continue to go missing in Chechnya. They are taken away in the middle of the night. Their bodies are not found and they are never seen again,\\" Kadyrov said to reporters in Grozny. \\"Through their crimes, they maintain tension in the republic, and their hands are stained with the blood of innocent people. The force is made up of kidnappers in armoured vehicles. They are a death squad.\\" * On February 25‚Äì26, 2006, Alvaro Gil-Robles, resigning Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, visited Chechnya, together with his successor, Thomas Hammarberg; they criticized abductions, impunity and lack of security in Chechnya. On March 2, 2006, Chechen ombudsman Nurdi Nukhadzhiyev stated the problem of forced disappearances of people in Chechnya cannot be solved by local authorities, adding that a special commission has to be created at federal level. * On May 12, 2006, Dmitry Grushkin of the 'Memorial' human rights group told Interfax that at least 1,893 residents of Chechnya had been kidnapped since 2002; of those, he said, 653 were found alive, 186 were found dead, and 1,023 \\"disappeared\\". 'Memorial' monitors kidnappings for only 25-30 percent of Chechen territory. * On November 13, 2006, HRW published a briefing paper on torture in Chechnya that it had prepared for the 37th session of the United Nations Committee Against Torture. The paper covered torture by personnel of the Second Operational Investigative Bureau (ORB-2), torture by units under the effective command of Ramzan Kadyrov, torture in secret detention and continuing \\"disappearances.\\" According to HRW, torture \\"in both official and secret detention facilities is widespread and systematic in Chechnya. Based on extensive research, HRW concluded in 2005 that forced disappearances in Chechnya are so widespread and systematic that they constitute crime against humanity.\\" Mass hostage takings Moscow theater hostage crisis On October 23, 2002, over 40 terrorists took more than 700 hostages prisoner at a Moscow theater. The hostage-takers demanded an end to the Russian presence in Chechnya, and threatened to execute the hostages if their conditions were not met. The siege ended violently on October 26, when Russian troops were forced to storm the building after the detonation of some explosive devices inside. Many casualties resulted from the fact that unconscious victims' airways were blocked and sub-optimal care was given during the rescue. In particular, the failure of Russian authorities to equip their troops with opioid antidotes and their efforts to conceal the identity of the gas for days afterward hindered efforts to save the lives of the stricken hostages. On November 2 Shamil Basayev assumed responsibility for the attack and apologized to Aslan Maskhadov for not informing him of the plan. Beslan school siege On September 1, 2004, a group of 32 heavily armed, masked men seized control of Middle School Number One and more than 1,000 hostages in Beslan, North Ossetia. Most of the hostages were children aged from six to sixteen years old. Following a tense two-day standoff punctuated by occasional gunfire and explosions, Alpha Group of the FSB raided the building. The fighting lasted more than two hours; ultimately 331 civilians, 11 commandos and 31 hostage-takers died. Russian officials publicly linked Baseyev and Maskhadov to the attack. Baseyev claimed responsibility in a September 17 website publication; Maskhadov denounced the attacks and denied involvement. The carnage at Beslan and the outcry it caused has had an unexpected effect on the tactics employed by Chechen separatists and their allies. Other hostage incidents * March 15, 2001 - Three Chechens hijacked a Russian Tu-154 aircraft with 174 people on board after it left Turkey; they forced it to land in Medina, Saudi Arabia. On March 16, Saudi commandos freed over 100 hostages, killing three people including a hijacker, a female flight attendant and a Turkish passenger. A Russian diplomat in Saudi Arabia said the leader of the hijackers was a \\"highly-trained military officer who appears to know what he is doing.\\" * April 22, 2001 - In Turkey pro- Chechen gunmen seized up to 100 hostages at a luxury hotel in Istanbul. The standoff lasted nearly 12 hours before the hostage-takers, armed with automatic rifles, surrendered; police said they had encountered no resistance from the gunmen and there were no reports of anybody being injured. * October 29, 2004 - The State Duma hosted Vladimir Ustinov, head of the Prosecutor General's Office, to discuss the Putin administration's anti-terrorism strategy. As he explained it to the deputies, in future hostage-taking episodes the security agencies would have a formal statutory right to seize and detain the relatives of the suspected hostage-takers. The government would then let the terrorists know that it will do to these \\"counter-hostages\\" whatever the terrorists do to their own hostages. Meanwhile, the practice of taking civilians hostages exists among the officers of Russian and local security agencies in Chechnya. On March 1, 2004, officers of security agencies seized more than 30 relatives of former Ichkerian defence minister Magomed Khambiyev, including women, in the Khambiyev family's native village of Benoy in Chechnya's Nozhay-Yurtovsky District. Magomed Khambiyev got an ultimatum to lay down his arms in exchange for the lives of his relatives; he did it, giving himself up to the authorities in a few days. * June 3, 2006 - Russian diplomats in Iraq were seized when their convoy was waylaid by the Mujahedeen Shura Council. One was shot during the kidnapping; three others were later executed. The group hoped to pressure Russia into allowing Chechnya to secede and become an Islamic theocracy. Massacres Indiscriminate attacks *On October 5, 1999, a bus filled with refugees was reportedly hit by a Russian tank shell, killing as many as 40 civilians and wounding several others. *On October 7, 1999, federal forces carried out a cluster bomb attack on the village of Elistanzhy in Vedensky District. Within several minutes 27 people were killed; among them only eight were men of \\"fighting age\\", meaning aged 14 to 60. In the next two weeks, 21 more died of their wounds. *On October 21, 1999, a series of Russian ballistic missile strikes on central Grozny killed at least 137 people, mostly civilians, and injured hundreds. The missiles hit the city's main marketplace, a maternity hospital and a mosque. *On October 24, 1999, seven children were killed and 14 maimed by a Russian tank attack in Novy Sharoy; an adult man was also killed. * On October 29, 1999, the Russian Air Force carried out a rocket attack on a large convoy of refugees who were using a \\"safe exit\\" route. Casualties were estimated at 50-100, among them several Red Cross workers, two journalists and many women and children. *On February 4, 2000, in an attempt to stop the Chechen retreat, Russian forces bombed the village of Katyr-Yurt, then a civilian convoy under white flags, killing at least 170 civilians, while many more were injured. *On February 9, 2000, a Russian tactical missile hit a crowd of people who had come to the local administration building in Shali, a town declared to be one of the \\"safe areas\\", to collect their pensions. The missile is estimated to have killed some 150 civilians, and was followed by an attack by combat helicopters causing further casualties. The Russian attack, which happened without any warning, was a response to infiltration of the town by a group of Chechen fighters who suffered few casualties. Documented mass killings *On December 3, 1999, at least 40 people fleeing the besieged Grozny were shot and killed by Russian troops, leaving only seven wounded survivors. *In early December 1999, Russian troops under the command of General Vladimir Shamanov killed up to 41 civilians during a two-week drunken rampage in the village of Alkhan-Yurt, near Grozny. *In several incidents during December 1999 and January 2000 in the Staropromyslovski district of Grozny, Russian troops killed at least 50 unarmed civilians, mostly elderly men and women. *A particularly brutal massacre was carried out on February 5, 2000 in the suburb of Erik Texidor, where suspected members of OMON, a special purpose police unit from St Petersburg and contract soldiers summarily executed at least 60 civilians. *Following the March 2000 Battle of Komsomolskoye about 70 Chechen combatants who were taken prisoner were officially amnestied, but almost all of them are believed to have been murdered in captivity. Rebel bombings *September 6‚Äì14, 1999 - a series of nighttime explosions in apartment buildings using hexogen (RDX) killed 307 and injured 1,700 people. Four buildings in Moscow, Buinaksk and Volgodonsk were destroyed. *May 9, 2002 - An explosion of a Russian-made anti-personnel mine in the Dagestani town of Kaspiysk killed 45 and wounded some 175 soldiers and civilian bystanders during a military parade. A Dagestani pro-Chechen group blamed for an attack had previously killed seven Russian soldiers on January 18, 2001, in the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala. * June 12, 2005 - A bomb planted by Russian nationalist extremists, said to be veterans of the Chechen wars belonging to the Russian National Unity group, derailed the Grozny-Moscow passenger train some 150 kilometers south of the Russian capital. Dozens of people were injured, but only eight hospitalized. On May 30, 2006, suspects Vladimir Vlasov and Mikhail Klevachyov were charged with terrorism and attempting to commit murder motivated by ethnic or religious hatred. Suicide bombings Between June 2000 and September 2004, Chechen insurgents added suicide attacks to their weaponry. During this period there were 23 Chechen related suicide attacks in and outside Chechnya, targeting both military and civilian targets, the profiles of the suicide bombers have varied just as much as the circumstances surrounding the bombings. Although only six of the attacks were directed against civilians, these attacks have drawn the lion's share of the publicity generated by Chechen suicide tactics. *July 5, 2003 - 19-year-old Zulichan Elichadzjijeva blew herself up outside a rock festival at the Tushino airfield near Moscow. Her bomb did not detonate as expected. 15 minutes later, only a few meters from the site of the first attack, 26-year- old Zinaida Alijeva detonated her explosives and killed 11 people instantly. Four more died in hospital. For many observers, the Tushino attacks appeared out of place. *December 5‚Äì10, 2003 - A shrapnel-filled bomb which was believed to be strapped to a lone male suicide attacker ripped apart a commuter train near Chechnya, killing 46 people and wounding nearly 200. The explosion occurred during a busy morning rush hour when the train was packed with many students and workers; it ripped the side of the train open as it approached a station near Yessentuki, 750 miles south of Moscow. Only five days later another blast shook Russia‚Äîthis time five people were killed and 44 injured in Red Square in the very heart of Moscow. Shamil Basayev later claimed responsibility for organising the December 2003 attacks. *February 6, 2004 - A bomb ripped through a Moscow metro car during the morning rush hour, killing 40 people and wounding 134. A previously unknown Chechen rebel group claimed responsibility for the bombing; the claim came from a group calling itself Gazoton Murdash, and was signed by Lom-Ali (\\"Ali the Lion\\"). According to the statement, the group launched the attack to mark the fourth anniversary of the killing of scores of Chechen civilians by Russian soldiers who took control of the Chechen capital Grozny. * August 27, 2004 - 123 people were killed by a female suicide bomber in the Russian aircraft bombings of August 2004. Basayev again claimed responsibility. Legal proceedings Trial in Russia Trials of Chechen separatists Since the Russian authorities do not treat the war as an armed conflict and enemies as combatants, the Chechen separatists are invariably described by the Russian government as terrorists or bandits. Captured extremists are routinely tried for such articles of the Russian criminal code as illegal weapons possession, \\"forming and participating in illegal armed groups,\\" and banditry. This strips detainees of key rights and protection under the Geneva Convention rules of war, including the right to be released at the end of the conflict and not to be held criminally liable for lawful combat. Participation in combat is treated as murder or attempted murder and terrorism, making little if any distinction with incidents of actual murders and terrorism. * One of the earliest war crimes trials to be held was that of Salman Raduyev, a notorious ex-field commander for the rebel Chechen forces. Raduyev was convicted in December 2001 of terrorism and murder charges and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in a Russian prison colony a year later. * On February 21, 2001, a Chechen field commander Salautdin Temirbulatov was sentenced to life in prison for murdering four Russian contract soldiers whose execution in 1996 was filmed on video tape. When Russia invaded Chechnya for the second time in September 1999, the video became a powerful weapon in the Kremlin's propaganda war, as it was shown to soldiers preparing for active service in the war-torn republic. Temirbulatov was also accused of terrorism and abducting Russian special unit servicemen taken prisoner during their raid into Chechnya in 1997. * On May 26, 2006, Nur-Pashi Kulayev was jailed for life for his part in the Beslan school hostage crisis. Trials of Russian servicemen The cases of a Russian servicemen being tried for war crimes are few and far between, no one has been charged with mistreatment or the murder of captured enemy fighters. Several servicemen have been accused and even convicted of a crimes against civilians: * On July 25, 2003, after a series of trials and retrials, Russian tank unit commander Col. Yuri Budanov was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the March 2000 abduction and murder of a Chechen woman, Elza Kungaeva. According to the newspaper Novye Izvestia Budanov mysteriously disappeared: he had left the prison colony in Dmitrovgrad but he did not arrive at his destination, a prison colony in Ulyanovsk Oblast. * On April 29, 2004, a Russian court in Rostov-on-Don acquitted four GRU special forces unit officers of the fatal shooting of six Chechen civilians, including a disabled woman. In the incident in January 2000, Captain Eduard Ulman's unit killed a civilian and subsequently extrajudicially executed five more with silenced weapons; the commandos then burned the bodies in the victims' vehicle. They were found not guilty in a retrial on May 19, 2005. Although the four admitted the killings, the court ruled that their actions were not punishable as they had been following orders. The acquittals of Cpt. Ulman and his three subordinates sparked a public outrage in Chechnya, where rights advocates and many Chechens say Russian forces act with impunity. During the third court hearing Ulman and the two officers mysteriously disappeared. * On March 29, 2005, a court in Grozny found Lieutenant Sergey Lapin (a police officer) \\"Kadet\\" and a member of the Khanty‚ÄìMansi OMON, guilty of torturing the \\"disappeared\\" Chechen civilian Zelimkhan Murdalov in January 2001, and sentenced him to 11 years imprisonment. * On October 27, 2005, Mukhadi Aziyev, a company commander of the Vostok (East) Spetsnaz GRU unit, was convicted of \\"exceeding official authority\\", and given a three-year suspended sentence regarding the June 2005 Borozdinovskaya operation resulting in the death or disappearance of 12 ethnic Avar civilians on Chechnya's border with Dagestan. * On April 5, 2006, Alexey Krivoshonok, a Russian serviceman, accused of killing three Chechen civilians at a roadblock in November 2005, admitted his guilt in his final plea. Next day, Krivoshonok, a contract soldier since 1995 whose rank was not disclosed, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for violent murder while under a state of alcoholic and narcotic intoxication. * On May 15, 2006, the Grozny Garrison Military Circuit Court completed the trial of contract soldier, Private Pavel Zinchuk. He was sentenced to seven years in a general penal colony for shooting and wounding from \\"hooligan motives\\" three civilian persons in the village of Staraya Sunzha near Grozny. * On December 27, 2007, Lt. Sergei Arakcheyev and Lt. Yevgeny Khudyakov were convicted by a Rostov-on-Don military court of the January 2003 of the killing of three local construction workers at a checkpoint in Chechnya and sentenced to 15 and 17 years in prison, respectively. According to court papers, Khudyakov and Arakcheyev forced the victims out of their truck, ordered them to lie on the ground and shot them dead; the bodies were doused in fuel and set on fire. Khudyakov failed to show up for the verdict and the court said police would soon start a nationwide search for him. European Court of Human Rights In October 2004, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) agreed to try cases brought by Chechen civilians against the Russian government. As of November 2007, 23 cases were decided by the Court. The cases include: * The first trial concluded in February 2005. The Court ruled that the Russian government violated several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, including a clause on the protection of property, a guarantee of the right to life, and a ban on torture and inhumane or degrading treatment, and ordered the Russian government to pay compensation to the six plaintiffs in the case. The cases concerned the Russian federal forces' indiscriminate aerial bombing of a civilian convoy of refugees fleeing Grozny in October 1999; the \\"disappearance\\" and subsequent extrajudicial execution of five individuals in Grozny in January 2000; and the indiscriminate aerial and artillery bombardment of the village of Katyr-Yurt in February 2000. The compensation has not been paid and NGOs claim that the applicants to the court have experienced persecution, including murders and disappearance. * In summer 2006 the ECHR decided the first cases concerning forced disappearances from Chechnya; more than 100 disappearance cases related to Chechnya were pending in the court. The cases included one where the court ordered Russia to pay 35,000 euros to the mother of Khadzhi-Murat Yandiyev for violating her son's \\"right to life\\" as well as failing \\"to conduct an effective investigation\\" into his February 2000 disappearance. Key evidence in the case, according to court documents, was video footage filmed by a reporter for NTV and CNN television showing an army officer, later identified by CNN reporters as Colonel-General Alexander Baranov, ordering soldiers to \\"finish off\\" and \\"shoot\\" Yandiyev. Baranov has since been promoted and awarded a Hero of Russia medal and is now responsible for all Defense Ministry forces in the North Caucasus. * On October 12, 2006, the Court held the Russian state responsible for the summary execution of the Estamirov family during the February 5, 2000 Novye Aldi massacre by OMON forces. \\"Russian and Chechen security forces should take this decision as a warning that the abuse and murder of innocent civilians cannot be met by impunity,\\" said Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. At least 11 other incidents of summary executions committed on the same day in the same region of Chechnya were pending before the Court. * On November 9, 2006, the Court ruled the Russian government complicit in the murder and abduction of three Chechen civilians, including a case on the disappearance and presumed death of two Chechens from the same family. The court sided with Marzet Imakayeva, a Chechen woman who fled Russia two years ago to seek asylum in the United States. It also said that the way Imakayeva's complaints were dealt with by Russian authorities constituted \\"inhuman treatment.\\" The bodies of Imakayeva family members have never been found. In the other case the abductee, the body of Nura Luluyeva turned up in a mass grave eight months later. * On January 8, 2007, the Court condemned Russia in the first torture case from Chechnya to be heard by the ECHR. In its judgment, the Court stated that the applicants Adam and Arbi Chitayev had been held in unacknowledged detention, that they had been subjected to torture, and that the Russian authorities had not properly investigated their allegations.

In 1983 wanting to address the lack of drawing specific how-to-videos in art stores he began to approach video production companies to create a drawing program to make drawing accessible. One of the production companies he approached was already preparing to produce a children's painting program, upon learning about the opportunity Mark convinced the company to change their focus citing the lack of available programming specifically geared to drawing techniques. The show developed into Maryland Public Television's 1985 production \\"The Secret City.\\" Mark starred as the host Commander Mark an enthusiastic space man teaching drawing techniques to viewers at home and the on-screen characters Zebtron, Metaman and Cindy the Dragon. The show was broadcast to 11 million PBS viewers each week far surpassing his original one million student goal. His art style is a cartoon 3D style that is focused on basic drawing techniques such as foreshortening, shading, surface, size, overlapping, contour, and density. His first book \\"Draw Squad\\" was released in 1988. In 1990 Mark was brought back to host a new Public Television program \\"Mark Kistler's Imagination Station.\\" The show demonstrated to viewers techniques on how to Draw-In-3D and having fun while doing it. In 2010 Mark was awarded an Emmy for the series for \\"teaching kids to draw in 3-D while imparting messages of self-esteem, and appreciation for literature, science, classic art and the environment. He continues to teach students in classroom settings, produced several drawing books, DVDs, and currently hosts live and streaming drawing tutorial videos to members through a subscription model on his website. His use of enthusiastic tag lines for viewers such as \\"Draw, draw, draw!\\", \\"Art Attack!\\", \\"Art Animals!!\\", \\"Yeeeeahhh\\", \\"Sharpen your pencils!\\", \\"pencil power!\\", and \\"Dream it, draw it, do it!\\" continue to be referenced as inspiration for other artists such as Jerzy Drozd, Lee Cherolis and Mike Krahulik of Penny Arcade. Commander Mark He portrayed Commander Mark in The Secret City Adventures, a fictional space-themed series where he taught child viewers skills and vocabulary to become better artists. Each episode included a segment where Mark would add to a large 12-foot mural that was added to each episode using a technique or several techniques learned throughout the series. The mural was inspired by his mother, who let him and his brother draw a mural in their childhood bedroom when they were young adolescents. The mural from the show had to be re-created 20 episodes into the production of the original 65 episodes due to broadcast cameras not being able to pick up the fine-lined artwork on the original light-colored background. The mural color was changed to a dark orange and had to be re-drawn by Mark by tracing over the original. Following the production MPT station VP Michael Styer as well as friend and co-creator and executive producer Robert Neustadt allowed Mark to keep the entire mural. The mural was so large it had to be shipped freight in a large crate to contain the 12-foot completed artwork. It currently hangs in his mother's classroom at Carlsbad High School in Carlsbad, California until Mark plans to relocate it to his home in Houston, Texas.

Simple A simple church may meet anywhere with or without trained leaders, formal liturgy, programs or structures.House2House Magazine Website, \\"What Do We Mean By Simple Church To facilitate relationship, discipleship (spiritual formation), multiplication, mobility, and member ownership, a simple church is usually a small group of no more than 20-25 persons. Most Church \\"programs\\" privately meet during some days of the week and discuss troubles that they are having with their faith, and personal life. Church \\"programs\\" are virtually nonexistent and small group participation is essential. The process of moving from worship to small group, small group to mission work, and mission work to worship is a primary focus. Authors Tony and Felicity Dale, founders of House2House Ministries, have promoted the term \\"simple church\\" in their book \\"Simply Church\\".Dale, T. and Dale, F. (2000) Simply Church. Karis Books, What We Do: Planting Simple Churches The term is often used interchangeably with other terms like organic church,Cole, N. (2005) Organic Church: Growing faith where life happens. John Wiley & Sons, essential church, primitive church, bodylife, relational church, and micro-church.Larry Kreider, \\"House Churches & Micro Churches\\" (Accessed September 29, 2006) In the early twenty-first century a number of established Christian denominations and mission organizations have officially supported efforts to develop house church networks. Origins and influences The simple church movement is part of the broader house church movement. Simple church has also been influenced by overseas missions and the growth of church planting movements.See David Garrison, \\"Church Planting Movements\\" (International Missionary Board Southern Baptist Convention, 2004); and Rad Zdero, \\"The Global House Church Movement\\" (William Carey Library Publishers, 2004, ). Church planting movements are spontaneously growing church multiplication efforts. The missional MovementFriend of Missional has also influenced simple church.Roger Thoman, \\"House Church Basics Pt. 3: Missional Church (Accessed September 29, 2006) Values As in any decentralized, spontaneous movement, a variety of values are expressed in simple church. Due to the influence of some key groups and Acts 2:42-47, three overarching values have emerged in many circles. Adherents Paul Kaak (who began ministry in one of the largest and most systematized mega-churches in America) and Neil Cole originally articulated these values using the letters DNA. According to him: * D - Divine Truth: Truth is the foundation for everything.A recent variation refers to the \\"D\\" as \\"Divine Connection\\" and views the Word of God and prayer as two primary means of maintaining that connection with God. The DNA metaphor is thus extended to include four overarching values instead of only three. *N - Nurturing Relationships : Healthy relationships are what make up a family. Love for one another is to be a constant pursuit of the family of God. * A - Apostolic Mission : Apostolic means, simply, ‚Äúsent.‚ÄùNeil Cole and Paul Kaak, Organic Church Planters Greenhouse: The First Story CMA Resources. Long Beach, 2004) pg. 1-6. Also published in Organic Church by Neil Cole These values have since been promoted by House2House MinistriesWhat Do We Mean By Simple Church (Accessed September 29, 2006) and DAWN North America, and have been adopted by various groups such as New York's MetroSoulMetroSoul Website, \\"What We Do: Planting Simple Churches (Accessed September 29, 2006) Practices Adherents George Barna and Frank Viola's book Pagan Christianity points out a number of reforms that organic churches often advocate. * The belief that modern clergy is a vestige of Roman pagan religion that was absent from the early church and is largely at odds with the true priesthood of all believers. The movement sees the institution of the clergy at odds with passages like Matthew 20, Matthew 23, 3rd John, and the message in Revelation regarding the deeds of the Nicolaitans (Greek-literally those who triumph over the people). 1 Corinthians 12-14 paints a picture of an every-member functioning church meeting entirely at odds with the modern religious service which is performed by professionals for an audience. However, some believe this view does not take into account the Jewish and synagogue based nature of the ekklesia, which explains the talk of elders and deacons found in the New Testament. In reply, many simple churches do recognize elders and deacons according to the biblical standards laid out in TImothy and Titus but believe these people emerge over time as their character becomes descriptive of these roles. In an environment where people are free to express their gifts, such people can emerge. Also, being an elder or deacon does not mean this person dominates the meeting. 3 John rebukes Diotrephes the elder who had to be first and was dominating. The simple church largely believes the idea that an elder or deacon is not a license for some to minister and others to be passive. * Valuing the Lord's Supper occurring as a regular, recurring full meal celebration rather than a short religious ritual. The early integration of the home based ritual into the public synagogue-like meeting functioned to reduce the symbolic nature of the act to a private moment, replacing its symbolism of fellowship and dedication to the Lord. This was complete by the time of Constantine, when home based agape feasts were banned. However, this history does not in itself devalue the need for the larger synagogue-like meeting for prayer, ministry of the word and singing. Simple church adherents also enjoy occasional and even monthly larger gatherings that do this very thing, though they emphasize the smaller meeting of the ekklesia as the environment for spiritual growth. * Organic churches tend to place less emphasis on the building or meeting place. To this end, Neil Cole, an adherent of simple church, states that \\"buildings, budgets, and big shots,\\" tend to do more to contain Christianity than allow it to spread.Cole, N. Organic Church However, this statement against larger sized churches does nothing to substantiate its claim. Media and popular attention In the early twenty‚Äìfirst century the growth of the movement has had increased news media coverage: Many books have been written on the simple church movement, especially by insiders (see House Church, Recommended Books). In the early twentyfirst century books began to appear by those studying the movement from a more objective view, including George Barna's Revolution.Barna, G. (2005). Revolution. Tyndale House. . Barna says that \\"revolutionary\\" expressions such as simple church will soon account for one third of American spirituality.Barna, G. (2005). Revolution. Tyndale House. p. 49. . Visibility of the movement also increased due to national and regional gatherings of various kinds. The largest of these is the Annual House Church Conference held in Dallas, USA and occasionally at other locations by House2House. Criticism How the simple church movement relates to constructing a theology and ecclesiology is the subject of much debate, especially with critics of the movement. Several prominent voices have serious concerns about simple church. For example, J. Lee Grady (Charisma Online Editor) says such a movement wants to \\"reinvent the church without its biblical structure and New Testament order ‚Äî and without the necessary people who are anointed and appointed by God to lead it. To follow this defective thesis to its logical conclusion would require us to fire all pastors, close all seminaries and Bible colleges, padlock our sanctuaries and send everybody home...\\"J. Lee Grady, Barna's Dangerous Proposal \\" (Accessed September 30, 2006) Grady and other critics worry that the simple church movement could encourage people to leave more traditional forms of church, which could lead to further collapse or decline of Christendom.
