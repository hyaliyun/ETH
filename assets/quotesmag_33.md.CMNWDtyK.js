She is best known for helping present a series of pageants in support of women's suffrage. Family and early life MacKaye was born into a prominent theatrical family. Her father Steele MacKaye (1842-1894) was a famous actor, playwright, and producer; Hazel was named after his hit play Hazel Kirke.https://ead.dartmouth.edu/html/ml5_fullguide.html MacKaye family papers, Dartmouth Hazel's mother Mary Medbery MacKaye (1845-1924) wrote a popular adaption of Pride and Prejudice for the stage in 1906. Hazel's siblings included engineer and writer James MacKaye (1872-1935), dramatist and poet Percy MacKaye (1875-1956), and conservationist Benton MacKaye (1879-1975). The family settled in Shirley, Massachusetts in 1888. MacKaye first intended to be a concert pianist, but in 1907 she enrolled in Radcliffe College theater classes taught by George Pierce Baker.The Torchbearers: Women and Their Amateur Arts Associations in America, 1890-1930, Karen J. Blair, Indiana University Press, 1994, p. 136 She failed to graduate but was made an honorary member of the 1910 class. After leaving Radcliffe MacKaye worked as an assistant on various pageant productions, including several with her older brother Percy. She was a charter member of the American Pageant Association in 1913 and wrote a \\"Who's Who\\" of the members. MacKaye also acted, touring with the Castle Square theater company of Winthrop Ames and appearing in her brother's Sappho and Phaon and Jeanne D'Arc (both 1907) and Mater (1908). She worked as an instructor at the Children's Educational Theatre in New York City. Career MacKaye was active in the woman suffrage movement, being present at the first meeting of Alice Paul's Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, forerunner of the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage and the National Woman's Party. The organizers of the Woman Suffrage Procession, planned for Washington, D.C. on March 3, 1913, just prior to Woodrow Wilson's inauguration, asked MacKaye to create a pageant for the event. Titled Allegory and produced by director Glenna Smith Tinnin, it was presented on the steps of the U.S. Treasury Building as the culmination of the event. The pageant was praised as \\"one of the most impressively beautiful spectacles ever staged in this country\\" in the New York Times.Torchbearers, p. 138 Her 1914 production \\"The American Woman: Six Periods of American Life\\", presented by the New York City Men's League for Women's Suffrage, \\"used historical scenes to expose the specific economic, political, and social oppressions of American women\\".Torchbearers, p. 139 It was not a popular success. Her 1915 production Susan B. Anthony, presented at Convention Hall in Washington, D.C., was more successful, raising money for Paul's Congressional Union and celebrating the life of the great early leader of women's suffrage. These productions were huge enterprises, involving hundreds of participants. In 1916 MacKaye staged a \\"Jubilee Pageant\\" for the National Young Women's Christian Association. By 1919 MacKaye was serving as Director of Pageantry and Drama for the organization.War Work Bulletin, Jan. 17, 1919, National Board of the Young Women's Christian Association, p. 3 (unnumbered) While with the YWCA MacKaye wrote a number of pageants for their use.

Its site is located near modern Kardamaina. Excavations have been ongoing since 1985. When settlement began in the area is unknown, although some remains of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age have been found. Ceramic fragments have also been found from the geometric and orientalizing periods, but during those centuries and also during the classical period the size of the Halasarna as well as whether it was an independent polis (city-state) or a small village is open to interpretation. It could have been an independent polis before the refoundation by synoecism of the city of Cos, because of a revolt in the year 366 BCE. Afterwards it was probably a deme of Cos. The remains of a sanctuary of Apollo Halasarna believed to belong to the 4th century BCE, have been excavated. That sanctuary should have been the second most important on the island after that of Asclepius. The settlement continued to be inhabited during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. From these periods fragments of pottery, statues of marble and terracotta, and inscriptions have been found, as well as remains of an ancient theatre and early Christian basilicas, among other artefacts. It is believed that the place was abandoned around the seventh century due to an earthquake and fear of Arab invasions.

It is separated into two locations, one at 2 Jalan Kemaman and another at 3 Bassein Road. Built by the Cantonese philanthropist Chan Chor Min , Chan Chor Min Tong ‚Äì Jalan Kemaman, National Heritage Board Singapore in 1926 and 1936 respectively, the hall hosted migrant Chinese workers with no family or means of support in Singapore. From being a place of lodging to now being a place of worship, Chan Chor Min Tong is significant as a representation of the vegetarian hall culture as well as the migrant origins of Singapore.  Vegetarian halls  Chan Chor Min Tong was a vegetarian hall, also known as a zhaitang. Show Ying Ruo, Chinese Buddhist Vegetarian Halls (zhaitang) in Southeast Asia: Their Origins and Historical Implications, Nalanda-Sriwijaya Centre Working Paper No 28 (Jul 2018). Vegetarian halls practice a Buddhist religion that is known as the Great Way (Xiantiandao, Chinese: ÂÖàÂ§©ÈÅì). This religion was a folk layman religion that was considered to be heterodox and was suppressed by China. Thus, the ideology spread to countries in South East Asia to avoid persecution. In these halls, worshippers would only consume a vegetarian diet as a form of purification and practice Buddhist rituals. However, these worshippers were not monks and were rather laymen, with one main master of the house acting as the primary caretaker.  Context  Singapore faced an influx of immigrants in the early 20th century after World War 1. National Library Board, Singapore infopedia: Chinese Coolies These immigrants were the main population of Singapore's workforce and consisted of not just men but also women. These women swore off marriage and left their homes in order to find work. Unfettered by the trappings of traditional marriage, they were free to gain their independence through finding work and becoming self-sustainable. They most likely took inspiration from the 19th-century independence movement in the districts of Guangzhou, China, where the mahjie and samsui women in Singapore also originated from., biblioasia: A Lifetime of Labour: Cantonese Amahs in Singapore, Janice Loo Thus the majority of them were likely to speak the Cantonese dialect. Alone, they gathered together and lived in these vegetarian halls as a community. The vegetarian halls offered a place to stay for these migrants with no homes or relationships with kin, provided that they would convert, and practice the vegetarian diet and the Buddhist rituals. They also had to remain single and abstain from sex., Bustling Balestier, Straits Times, 2018 It was not free of charge, as they still had to find work or do chores to stay. These places established a community amongst these immigrants, bounded by their oaths to care of each other. This was important, especially since most would probably never return to their hometown again due to financial costs. As part of a community, they were assured that through old age and then in death they were not alone and that the necessary funeral rites would be performed for them.Cantonese Society in China and Singapore: Gender, Religion, Medicine and Money, Marjorie Topley, 1954. At the same time, Balestier was also slowly evolving to be a relatively affluent residential neighborhood. This invited many wealthy philanthropists to buy land and erect religious institutions.Balestier Heritage Trail: A Companion Guide, National Heritage Board Singapore, 2018 This resulted in the creation of many Chinese religious institutions like the Thong Teck Sian Tong Lian Sin Sia Buddhist- Taoist temple, Boon Teck Road Water Kiosk and Thong Teck Sian Tong Lian Sin Sia, National Heritage Board and the Fei Hsia Tsing She Buddhist temple in Balestier.  History  In 1926, Chan Chor Min Tong was founded by Master Chan Chor Min. The first temple was a one-story terrace house built at 2 Jalan Kemaman Rd and housed migrant men. A decade later in 1936, the second temple was built as a two-storey terrace house at 3 Bassein Road. This temple housed the migrant women instead. In the 1940s just before World War II, the old master Chan passed away, and the current master took over his duties., Retired Homes The zhaitang of Balestier Road, Marcus Ng, Victor Yue, 2012 During the 1960s‚Äì1970s, the last residents in both halls have all passed away and Chan Chor Min Tong ceased being a place for lodging. Windows into the past: the mysterious house at Bassein Road, The Long Winding Road, Jerome Lim, 2016  Present day  Today, both halls are maintained by a trust as religious halls, and only opens its doors to visitors during Chinese New Year. The Jalan Kemaman site is only open on the 3rd day of the Chinese New Year, while the Bassein Rd site is open for the first 3 days. The visitors are usually the elderly who have been coming for decades, as well as their families. Many of the adults there are also continuing the tradition. They were brought to the temple by their parents, and are now bringing children of their own there as well. As Chan Chor Min Tong is mainly a Cantonese enclave, most of the visitors converse in Cantonese as well. At Jalan Kemanan, visitors would first enter the compound and make their way past the garden and into the side of the house. They offer their prayers to Guanyin the Goddess of Mercy, through offerings and joss sticks for their wishes such as wealth and good studies in the coming year. After, they proceed to the back where they pay their respects to the deceased past master of the house. Following, visitors crawl under the offering table in a tradition unique to the temple. Devotees believe in that crawling under the table would bring them good fortune in the coming year, and even encourage visitors to repeat this three times for extra luck. After which, they proceed back to the main altar where they pray and drink holy water in front of the current master of the house. Visitors are also treated to vegetarian food cooked by the temple volunteers. Visitors will be seated around a table with other strangers and be served Yu Sheng, vegetarian bee hoon and noodles. At Bassein Road, most visitors arrive on the first day, and the number slowly dwindles by the third day in which it becomes mostly quiet. Just like at Jalan Kemanan, one pays their respect to Guanyin and the old masters of the house.  Future  Chan Chor Min Tong is currently managed by a trust, which would decide the future of both buildings. It is situated in a prime location of Balestier. All around the Bassein Road site, high-rise condominiums tower over the two-storey terrace house, hiding it away from view. Several visitors to the Jalan Kemanan temple have also been turned away by rumors that the Bassein Road site had been demolished and have since stopped visiting. Devotees volunteer to take care of the place for short periods of time but do not reside there anymore. Most of them are also retirees. Many of the visitors are also aged, while the place is unheard of by the younger generation, so the number of visitors may dwindle over time. As such, although it brings together the community of worshippers, it is still at risk of being demolished if the trust someday decides to sell it.  Architecture  Wide usage of octagonal windows to represent the Ba Gua in Taoism and provide ventilation The building at Jalan Kemaman is a one-story L-shaped house. It features a garden in the front containing plants that are commonly used for tropical remedies. It houses the shrine to Guanyin in the side wing, while the main shrine to the hall sits at the back. According to the elderly visitors, the roof used to be made of attap while the path was made of mud. The site has recently undergone renovations, with the roof replaced by a pitched roof and the paths paved with concrete. The Bassein Road house was built as a two-storey terrace house. The building is made of two houses separated by a courtyard with a connecting corridor. In the building, wide walkways and large living spaces exhibit the function of the house as a communal space. It also features a traditional kitchen and a garden. The use of the number eight in its architecture is also very prominent. The windows are octagonal in shape, and the double doors in the four walls in the courtyard adds up to eight. This would probably tie into the Ba Gua philosophy in Taoism. Tropical considerations were also built in place, with both buildings featuring perforated windows as well as high ceilings and doorways that allow for ventilation. At Bassein Rd, Linoleum also lines the second floor and insulates against the bare concrete that rapidly loses heat at night.

It was from this place that Shiva threw his chimta towards the famous Kera Tree splitting it into two halves along with the land. It is believed that Suswani Mata entered into the Earth along with her lion and the Earth closed up again. The Kera tree still stands there lush and green since the above-mentioned incident which took place at AD 1173 according to the deciphered inscription of the main temple. Legend Goddess Ambe incarnated as Suswani Mata and was born to Sri Seth Satidasji and Srimati Sugankanwarji of Nagaur in V.S. 1219. Her marriage was fixed at the age of 10 in the Dugar family. She was very beautiful. On the day of her pre-marital function, the nawab of Nagaur was allured by her beauty and fell in love with her. He expressed his wish to marry 'Suswani' in front of her father, but her father said that the girl was an incarnation of the Mata Ambe and it was not in his power to bestow her on any body. As marital relationship between Hindu and Muslim was not possible her father rejected the proposal. The nawab got furious and threatened to kill the whole family and imprisoned Seth Satidas. The entire family blamed Suswani for the whole incident. Suswani became upset and started praying to Arihant and felt asleep. In her sleep she saw a dream of an enlightened idol assuring her not to worry. The idol told Suswani to inform the nawab that she would marry him, if he fulfills the condition laid down by her. The condition was that,\\"She would be at a distance of 7 feet from him and he should catch her by following her either barefooted or on a horse.However the idol assured her that he will never be able to catch her.\\" > \\"‡§®‡•à‡§® ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§Ö‡§∞‡§ø‡§π‡§®‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Ä‡•§ ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§® ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§®‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§à‡•§ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§™‡•ç‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç > ‡§§‡•á‡§ú‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä ‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§® ‡§®‡•á ‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§π‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ö‡§® ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡•§‡•§ ‡§ò‡§¨‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à ‡§â‡§∏‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§î‡§ï‡§æ‡§§ > ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•à‡•§‡•§ ‡§§‡•Ç ‡§â‡§∏ ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§ï‡§π‡§≤‡§æ‡§¶‡•á ‡§∂‡§∞‡•ç‡§§ ‡§∞‡§ñ‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡•á‡§∞‡•á ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á‡•§‡•§ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§§ ‡§™‡§æ‡§Ç‡§µ‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§õ‡•Ç‡§ü > ‡§¶‡•á‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§™‡•Ä‡§õ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§≤‡•á ‡§ò‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡•á ‡§ö‡§¢‡§º‡§ï‡§∞‡•§‡•§ ‡§µ‡•ã ‡§§‡•Å‡§ù‡§ï‡•ã ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§™‡§ï‡§°‡§º ‡§™‡§æ‡§Ø‡•á‡§ó‡§æ ‡§¶‡•å‡§°‡§º-‡§¶‡•å‡§°‡§º ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§•‡§ï > ‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡•á‡§ó‡§æ‡•§‡•§ \\" \\\\- Suswani Mata Ki Gatha The proof of this dream would be the saffron tilak on the forehead of her family members, in the morning and the idol disappeared. Suswani woke up and narrated the entire dream to her mother and found the saffron tilak on the forehead of the family members. All the members were pacified and thereafter the message was sent to the nawab. The nawab agreed to her terms and was extremely happy. Sethji was freed from the prison. Very soon nawab with a few soldiers arrived at Sethji's palace. Suswani left the imprints of the kumkum hand on the wall near the front door of the house, before starting to run. As per the condition, she started running on foot, and the evil nawab on the horse leaving a gap of 7 feet in between them. . The nawab was unable to catch her, although he was on a horse and the distance remained the same. She kept on running and when she got tired, she prayed for help. Immediately a lion appeared on which she mounted and continued running up to the present Bikaner district's Morkhana village. There she saw a shrine of Shiva and prayed for help. Shiva appeared in front of her and threw a chimta in front of the temple, amidst a Kera tree. As soon as Suswani reached the place, the Kera tree and the earth parted in two making a thunderous sound. Suswani entered into the earth with the lion and the earth closed up again, leaving a small part of her saree out. The Nawab and his friends fought for the pallu and killed each other. The divine shrine of Morkhana still witness the fully bloomed Kera tree. In V.S. 1232, Malhadas Surana, the younger brother of Seth Satidas Surana, saw a dream in which Suswani in the form of Devi, ordered him to construct a temple at the place where she entered into the earth. He expressed his inability due to lack of money. Devi told him about a place with hidden treasure in his goshala. Malhadas constructed the temple, a well and a Goshala with the help of that money. When Malahdas Surana expressed the lack of money to construct the temple, Devi told him about a place with hidden treasure in his Goshala. Malahdas constructed a temple of Suswani Mataji with the help of that money. Prominent Temples Apart from Chief temple at Morkhana, her major temples are located at Nagaur(Rajasthan), Jodhpur (Rajasthan), Rajarhat (West Bengal), Viluppuram (Tamil Nadu), Attibele (Karnataka), Andarsul (Maharashtra), Kanwaliyas (Rajasthan).

After having participated in the show ' in 2011 and collaborated on ' (2010‚Äì12), she is a regular columnist for the program Le Cercle, hosted by Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder on Canal+ Cin√©ma. In March 2014, she launched a series entitled \\"Questions de Caract√®re\\". (co-edition Plon / France Culture): she interacts with contemporary philosophers while keeping the spirit and approach of her program. The first volume, co-written with Jean-Luc Nancy, deals with jouissance, a theme on which she has already spoken several times. On December 19, 2017, it was announced that Ad√®le Van Reeth would take over from Jean-Pierre Elkabbach and host the new literary program of Public S√©nat, still recorded in the Senate Library, Livres & Vous. From September 2018, she hosted the show ' on France 2.http://www.jeanmarcmorandini.com/article-382556-frederic-taddei-ecarte-de- la-presentation-de-d-art-d-art-sur-france-2-la-pastille-culturelle-qu-il- presentait-depuis-son-lancement-en-2002.html  Publications  * La Jouissance in collaboration with Jean-Luc Nancy, co-edition Plon / France culture, 2014. * R√©ussir le bac philo, under the direction of Ad√®le Van Reeth, Fayard, 2014. * La M√©chancet√© in collaboration with , co-edition Plon / France culture, 2014. * L‚ÄôObstination in collaboration with , co-√©dition Plon / France culture, 2014. * Le Snobisme in collaboration with Rapha√´l Enthoven, co-edition Plon / France culture, 2015. * La Pudeur, in collaboration with √âric Fiat, co-edition Plon / France culture, 2016. * Questions de caract√®re (compiles five themes addressed in the program: jouissance, malice, obstinacy, snobbery and modesty)  See also  * Women in philosophy * List of women philosophers * Jean-Luc Nancy  References   External links  * Les Nouveaux chemins de la connaissance on France Culture * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Belgian descent Category:21st-century French philosophers Category:French television presenters Category:French radio personalities Category:ENS Fontenay-Saint- Cloud-Lyon alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni ","title":"Ad√®le Van Reeth"},{"id":"60169894","text":"Musica de Camara (Spanish for Chamber music) is a non-profit organization, based in New York, devoted to presenting classical music concerts in and around New York City venues including schools.

It consists of the historic surroundings of the Googong Dam that predated the dam itself. It is also known as the Googong Foreshores Cultural and Geodiversity Heritage Areas. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 3 November 2017.  History  There is evidence that Aboriginal people occupied the area in the vicinity of the Queanbeyan River. Googong Foreshores contains physical evidence of Aboriginal occupation, including sites containing stone artefact scatters, a scarred tree, cairns (potentially associated with burials) and campsites. An excavation of a shelter immediately outside Burra Cave revealed some quartz flaking debris and two hearths \\"dating from 700 to 900 BP with some charred bone material\\".Spate 1993, citing Boot and Cooke 1990 In 1823, the \\"London Bridge\\" arch was first described by Captain Mark Currie during exploration in which he named the Monaro Plains. In 1834, Joseph Kenyon started a cattle run at 'Katy's Flat' but soon forced to leave due to poor conditions. Two pastoral properties were established in the area, divided by the Burra Creek. The west bank was granted to William Hutchinson in 1836, who conducted the \\"Burra Estate\\", a pastoral run of 5293 acres, in absentia. The east bank was acquired by John McNamara Sr. through Crown grant and selection in 1857, and was later known as \\"London Bridge\\". In 1872, McNamara acquired 1902 acres of the Burra Estate and began farming sheep. McNamara Sr died in 1901, and his son, John McNamara Jr, inherited the property and moved there to live. The estate was sharply reduced in 1904 by the auction of 3442 acres from London Bridge North, and in 1908 McNamara Jr. and his family left the district for Sydney. They leased the property to Fred Campbell of Woden, who installed Arthur Warwick as overseer. In 1912, the lease expired on the London Bridge homestead, and McNamara Jr. leased his property to his neighbour at London Bridge, James Moore. McNamara Jr. returned to London Bridge in 1914, but died in residence in 1915. The property was again leased to the Moores until being sold to Edward and Jim Noone on 21 January 1921. London Bridge Homestead was purchased by Robert Douglas in 1928, and shearing at the old woolshed ceased in the same year. Sheep were shorn at Burra Station for a period until Douglas commissioned a new woolshed during the Depression years. The orchard was planted or extended at this time. Electric power was connected to London Bridge HOmestead in 1954 at a cost of ¬£200. In 1973, 5089 hectares of land, including London Bridge, north and south, was acquired by the Commonwealth of Australia from New South Wales for the creation of the Googong Reservoir Foreshores. Andrew Douglas leased a section of the London Bridge Homestead property back from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth enacted the Canberra Water Supply (Googong Dam) Act 1974 (Googong Dam Act) in 1974. This Act vested control over water supply and management of the Googong Dam Area in the Australian Capital Territory Executive, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth. The construction of Googong Dam was completed in 1978. In 1983, the ACT government commissioned Philip Cox and Associates to prepare a Conservation Management Plan for the London Bridge Homestead. In 1999, conservation work was undertaken at London Bridge Homestead.  Description  The Googong Foreshores Cultural and Geodiversity Heritage Area is a 223 hectare area of land largely cleared for pastoral use. A small river called Burra Creek runs through the place. There is also a collection of farm buildings including the London Bridge Homestead group, a woolshed and squatter's quarters. The London Bridge Homestead group of buildings is located near to Burra Creek and the buildings are arranged to form an \\"L\\" shape. Four buildings are included in the homestead group: a stone cottage, a slab hut, a lath and plaster building, and a weatherboard building with a fibro annex. The woolshed and shearer's quarters are located approximately 1.5 km away from the homestead. The area also includes a distinctive natural limestone formation, London Bridge Arch, which acts as a natural bridge over a section of the Burra Creek. London Bridge Arch formed in limestone containing fossils of brachiopods, corals, crinoids and trilobites.ACT Government, 2007 It developed, along with several smaller caves, from erosion at a meander bend in Burra Creek. Formation of the arch resulted in a meander cut off which occurs when the two closest parts of a meander bend are directly connected, usually causing the river to abandon the meander loop and continue straight downstream. An abandoned meander loop is visible east of Burra Creek. The limestone which contains the arch and caves is a small lens (approximately 50m by 150m) developed in the late Silurian Cappanana Formation. The arch is 34m long, about 12-18m wide and 5m high, while 5-7m vertical cliffs occur above both entrances to the arch. Two through caves, containing patches of flowstone and Pleistocene fossil deposits, occur in the limestone above the level of the arch.AHDB 1182 These caves, Douglas and Burra, are older creek passages. Several other small caves and shelters also occur in the limestone.  Condition  The condition of the buildings in the London Bridge complex has been described as fair to good.ACT Government 2007 The buildings have previously been conserved to a high standard, although it is unclear how much work has been undertaken on them since 2002. The buildings have retained much of their original fabric. London Bridge Arch is in good condition with some minor insignificant damage occurring within the caves.Finlayson, 2014 Historic and recent visitor use has compacted some of the cave deposits and destroyed some surface fossils, and historic graffiti is evident within the Douglas and Burra caves.Boot & Cooke, 1990 The surrounding landscape is mostly highly modified former pastoral country.  Heritage listing  The Googong Foreshores Cultural and Geodiversity Heritage Area is an important heritage area because of its ability to demonstrate the region's pastoral, Aboriginal, geological and natural history, including through its archaeological deposits. The place demonstrates a number of settlement and pastoral practices used in the area and wider region. The place and the buildings within it demonstrate past living conditions, rare nineteenth and early twentieth century historic building techniques and later evolution in building practice. The London Bridge Arch and its associated cave deposits are also significant. The Arch is valued because of its ability to demonstrate karst processes. The Arch also provides insight into the evolution of the local natural landscape. The cave deposits provide further insight into past flora and fauna regimes of the area. The London Bridge Arch and London Bridge Homestead building group are also valued for their aesthetic appeal appreciated by the local community. Googong Foreshores was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 3 November 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The Googong Foreshores Cultural and Geodiversity Heritage area has important historic heritage value because of the place's ability to demonstrate aspects of the pastoral history of the Canberra and Queanbeyan region. The features which express this value include, but are not limited to, the location of the homestead and associated farm buildings near to Burra Creek, the arrangement of the remnant farm buildings, their function and architecture including the building materials used and the demonstration of historic building methods. The buildings and the buildings within their surroundings demonstrate aspects of the living conditions experienced by the people living and working on the pastoral property. The place also has significant heritage value for providing insight into the development of the local landscape as it demonstrates a naturally eroded limestone arch and caves formed at a meander bend, resulting in a meander cut-off and the eventual abandonment of a meander loop. Features which express this value are the London Bridge Arch and associated caves, Burra Creek and the abandoned meander loop visible to the east of the arch. Criterion B: Rarity The Googong Foreshores Cultural and Geodiversity Heritage area has important heritage value because of the place's possession of rare aspects of the Canberra region's vernacular and rural architecture. The features which express this value include, but are not limited to, the building fabric of the London Bridge Homestead and all associated rural buildings. The place also has significant heritage value for the presence of a rare and unusual geological formation, London Bridge Arch and its associated caves. Criterion C: Research The Googong Foreshores Cultural and Geodiversity Heritage area has important research value because of the place's ability to provide information that will lead to a better understanding of the establishment and development of pastoral properties in the Canberra and Queanbeyan region. The buildings are also an important historic record. In part the place also represents pastoral practices implemented more widely beyond the immediate region. Features which express this value include, but are not limited to, the built fabric of the place, the location, function and arrangement of rural buildings and their proximity to Burra Creek plus the place's demonstration of establishment processes such as land clearing, use of water, field and stock management. The place also has significant heritage value for its ability to provide information that will lead to a wider understanding of Aboriginal use of the area over time. These archaeological values occur throughout the entire place. The place also has significant heritage value due to its potential to provide additional information on the formation of the local landscape and the past flora and fauna assemblages of the Burra Creek Valley. Features which express this value include, but are not limited to, the London Bridge Arch and caves incorporating rich Pleistocene cave deposits and fossil remains of large and small mammal species, some of which are locally extinct. Criterion D: Characteristic values The Googong Foreshores Cultural and Geodiversity Heritage area has significant heritage value for its importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of cave formation in the local region due to karst processes. Features which express this value are the London Bridge Arch and associated caves, Burra Creek and the abandoned meander loop visible to the east of the arch. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics The London Bridge Arch is an unusual and attractive natural landmark valued by the local community. Features which express this value include the dramatic form of the natural arch, its demonstration of geological processes and its association with Burra Creek, the small, natural river course flowing underneath. The presence of water is an important part of its aesthetic appeal. The London Homestead group of buildings (excluding the shearer's quarters and woolshed) within its rural setting is valued by the local community for its picturesque quality. These aesthetic characteristics are best appreciated by homestead visitors walking in the area. Distant views and immediate views of the London Homestead group of buildings are important. Features which express this value include, but are not limited to, distant and immediate views of the London Homestead group of buildings, the historic character of the homestead group of buildings, the vernacular building materials used and the presentation of these buildings within their wider rural setting.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Mulwala Homestead was founded as part of the process of European pastoral development of the vast Riverina. Squatters started moving into the eastern Riverina in the late 1820s as the area's pastoral potential was recognised by colonists. The region's Aboriginal inhabitants were displaced as the tide of white settlement advanced. An early settler at Mulwala was George Hillas, but the central story of the property is that of the Sloane family. Alexander Sloane emigrated from Scotland to Australia in 1849. He married Annabella (nee Gibson) in 1856 and they had a family. In 1853 Sloane formed a pastoral company, and after a brief trip to Scotland in 1854 he returned to Australia. In 1862 he purchased Savernake, north of Mulwala village, where he had nearly 5000 sheep by January 1863. In 1864 he purchased Mulwala Station from Hillas. Here the Sloanes lived in the slab hut built by Hillas, near a lagoon close to the Murray River, which they extended, and they built other buildings. Then a flood came in 1867, causing much damage. The Sloanes moved some of the buildings to a higher site and these formed the genesis of the present homestead complex. Sheep numbers on Mulwala grew from 12,081 in 1865 to 60,604 by 1874, and the station attained a good reputation as a sheep stud. The 1890s depression, which ruined many properties, was weathered by the Sloanes, as Alexander turned to wheat farming to supplement the property's revenue, and he brought in share farmers. In 1870 the homestead was described as \\"one of the most pleasant on the Murray\\".Freeman, p.278 The remains of the lagoon buildings formed the central and south wings of the new homestead. In 1869 a schoolroom was added to a north wing, and over the coming years other rooms were added. The homestead buildings were mainly Murray or Cypress Pine slab, with shingle roofs, with internal walls lined with pine boards and finished with calico and wallpaper. A good fruit and vegetable garden was developed. The major final addition to the house was a pise wing in 1927-29, designed by a Corowa architect, Mr MacKnight. Various outbuildings were constructed over the years, the shearing shed having been begun in 1867 and subsequently expanded. Alexander died in 1907. During the early twentieth century, the various Sloane holdings were split up amongst the family members. After 1964, Mulwala Homestead was not permanently occupied, though still owned by the Sloanes. The Mulwala Explosives Factory had been developed nearby during the Second World War. In 1982, due to expansion of the factory, Defence bought Mulwala Station from the remaining Sloane owner. Later, the caretaker who had been in the building till then was moved out (due to safety concerns, with the explosives works coming closer to the homestead) and public access to the historic home was reduced. With the buildings empty there were concerns about their maintenance. The Department of Defence and the Department of Housing and Construction have carried out some conservation works, but the complex has deteriorated. The property is currently owned by Defence/ADI. A large and significant collection of archival material created through the lifetime of the Sloanes' occupation of Mulwala is no longer on site, and has not been for some years. It is spread between Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga and family members around Mulwala and in Melbourne.  Description  Mulwala Homestead Precinct is at the homestead and all associated nearby outbuildings and garden, the woolshed and shearers quarters, the sheep dip, the land running between the shearers quarters and sheep dip; and the burial site. The place consists of the homestead, outbuildings, yards, a remnant garden, woolshed and shearers quarters, a sheep dip and remnant sheep wash site, a burial site and a pastoral landscape. There are other archaeological sites outside the boundary. The homestead complex comprises several wings, which are single storey, and it contains 40 rooms. The north wing has a mix of hipped and gabled roofs, clad in corrugated iron. Walls are mostly vertical slab Cypress Pine, some of which has been painted, some varnished. There is some weatherboard and brick walling as well. Verandahs are timber-floored, with corrugated iron roofs and timber posts. The three chimneys have corbelled tops and are made of hand-pressed bricks. The central wing has an iron-clad hipped roof, with some shingles remaining under the iron. Walls are entirely vertical pine slabs; again some are varnished and some painted. The verandah is timber floored and has timber posts, and the roof is a continuation of the main hipped roof. Again, there are three corbelled chimneys. The south wing has a hipped roof, clad with iron. Walls are of Flemish bond brick, and weatherboard. Verandahs are timber floored although there is a concrete-floored section. Two of the three brick chimneys have double flues. The final wing is that built of pise, with walls 500mm thick, and a surface which has been rough trowelled and painted. Chimneys are also pise. The roof is long, L-shaped, hipped and clad with iron. The verandah has a timber floor and posts, the roof is an extension of the main roof; on the west side is a sunroom enclosed with screen walls, with the lower part clad with asbestos cement. The slabs in the buildings have been pit-sawn rather than adzed, which is of additional interest. Some of the internal features are as follows (room numbers are as per the Allom Lovell Sanderson report in the bibliography). Room 1, essentially 1868 in configuration, has slab walls and a board ceiling. Room 2 has hessian and wallpaper covered slab walls, a cypress mantelpiece, board ceiling and double- hung sash windows and an early door. Room 3 has a 1910 carpet, slab walls with cover strips and wallpaper, board ceiling, early door and catch, sash 6-pane windows; the room is basically 1891, but with an 1868 fireplace. Room 4 has a lino-covered floor, the usual 4-panel door, and 6-pane casement windows. Room 7 has early skirtings, as found generally in the house. Room 8 has hessian and paper to the walls, and two arches; its form dates from the 1870s and 1920s. Room 10 was used as a photographic dark room, with calico and paper covered board walls. Room 11 has lino and rugs on the floor, and is basically 1872 with an 1878 chimney. Room 13 has exposed rafters and is 1877 in vintage. Room 14, a hall, has painted fibrous plaster walls, a varnished ceiling and a 4-panel door with toplight. Room 15 has cement-rendered walls and varnished pine skirtings, and 6-pane double-hung sashes. Room 17 has a centre rug and a stain-finished perimeter floor (as does Room 27), hard plastered walls and brass door furniture. Room 18 is similar. There is some porcelain door furniture in the house as well as brass. Room 21 has 1950s toilet fittings. Room 22, a shower, has ripple-iron walls. Room 23, bathroom, has asbestos cement walls to dado height and fibrous plaster above. Rooms 28-40 are in the pise wing, with plastered pise walls, board floors, skirtings, board and fibreboard ceilings and with an original fuel stove in one room. The outbuildings are numerous, although some others have been lost. The woolshed was built in 1867 and enlarged four times up to the early 1900s; it had 16 stands by 1881. It has large square posts and tree-trunk beams, sapling rafters, a mix of slab and sheet metal walls, and the formerly shingled roof is clad with iron. In the 1980s there were still many tools and pieces of equipment inside and these may still remain. Blades were superseded by powered shears in the 1890s-1900s period. The shearers' quarters, dating from the late 1920s-early 1930s, is a building with weatherboard walls, iron-clad gabled roof, skillion lean-to, double-hung sash windows, is internally lined with boards, has vertical-boarded doors, and an asbestos-cement laundry/washroom was added later. The shearers' dining hut is weatherboard, with an iron-clad gable roof, two brick chimneys and a brick bread oven. Other outbuildings are as follows. The engine shed dates from 1927 and was built as a laundry, and still contains the boiler and copper. The carpenter's shed is late 1890s, early 1900s and iron-clad. The pump shed has a diesel engine and the floor is trodden earth. The pump house is built over a brick-lined well. The garage, built 1916, is weatherboard with a gabled iron roof. A dovecote is gabled, weatherboard and originally had a brick floor. The carriage shed is gabled, with large doors at one end, and has tack and store rooms as well as a groom's room. Walls are vertical slab, and the building may have been erected in 1874. The machinery shed is weatherboard, gabled and is partly open. The 1916 feed shed is weatherboard and includes boys' and jackeroos' rooms. Other outbuildings include a toilet and chicken coops. There are several water tanks of varying materials and age. A child's grave (that of Alexander Turner Sloane, the fourth son, who died in 1871) is known to exist on the property, although its features are not evident; it is to the south and west of the homestead. At the far north-west of the site have been found the remains (in the form of several posts) of the nineteenth century sheep wash, together with a more intact sheep dip in the form of a brick and concrete structure, with yards. The garden, which was well developed in the late 1800s, has been little maintained since the 1930s. Over 140 individual trees have been identified in the garden area. Frequently found are Pepper trees, Monterey Pine, Kurrajong and Cedar, as well as fruit and nut trees. A citrus avenue runs across the former driveway/turning circle. Trees range in age from around 30 years to nearly 130, and some of them are not in good condition (the Bunya Pine was reported to be poor in the mid 1980s). There are traces of paths and driveways. The garden has a mix of formal and axial patterns and informal groupings. Raised mounds indicate former vegetable and flower beds. Much of the garden had a utilitarian purpose, to provide vegetables and fruit for the station population. Near the house is the remains of the tennis court. Between the woolshed/shearers complex and the sheep dip there are grazing paddocks and timbered areas which provide a remnant rural setting to the homestead and other buildings and structures. Condition  The buildings and garden as a whole have deteriorated and the complex is run down. Termites and entry of water have been two particular problems. Examples of present problems include chimney corbelling coming adrift, dying garden trees, gutters full of leaves, some fabric falling off outbuildings, one outbuilding has been relocated, some verandah flooring is missing, paintwork is in fair to poor condition, areas of roofing iron are showing rust, some ceilings and walls are cracking, areas of rising damp in walls, and considerable evidence of entry by possums and sheep. The woolshed is in poor condition, roofing is in part missing and structural timbers are failing. Trees are growing close to some outbuildings and are gradually damaging the dovecote and the garage. Explosive storage magazines are close to the precinct. (August 2003)  Heritage listing  Mulwala Homestead Precinct was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 with the following rationale: Mulwala Homestead was developed from the 1860s to the 1920s and the precinct is historically significant. Mulwala Station was part of the wave of development of the Riverina during the nineteenth century and the place is associated with the growth of pastoralism in this important region. Mulwala played a notable role in the development of stud flocks and the advancement of wheat growing in this part of New South Wales. Mulwala illustrates many of the characteristics of the Australian nineteenth century homestead, for example high pitched hipped roofs extending to encircling verandahs, a joined series of single storey buildings which reflect the process of growth, and a typical selection of materials such as Cypress Pine slabs, weatherboard, corrugated iron, brick and pise, and the original and early materials used in the interiors. The scattering of outbuildings, and their modes of construction and their materials, also serve to typify these sorts of pastoral complexes in the region. The sheep dip and remnant sheep wash are further elements characteristic of sheep properties of the area. The place is of additional interest for the use of pit-sawn (as opposed to adzed) slabs, which makes the place relatively rare. Also somewhat uncommon is the use of vertical slabs for a Riverina homestead as opposed to just the outbuildings. Of exceptional interest and rarity value is the extent of the surviving elements of the original homestead at the newer high site after the floods of 1867. Further, the property was owned by the one family, the Sloanes, from the 1860s until resumption by the Commonwealth in the 1980s. The grave of a Sloane son, although no longer marked, is in the south-west part of the precinct. The landscape of partly timbered and grazed paddocks, remnant garden, and complex of extended homestead and scattered outbuildings is evocative of the Riverina pastoral life and possesses notable aesthetic values.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  The first record of army use in Armidale was 1897, when the 6th Light Horse was based in the town during the Boer War; the first official record was two years later in 1899. These events appear to have been related to a site in Faulkner Street, Armidale. A larger, less flood prone site, in Mann Street, was acquired by the Commonwealth in 1904. The transaction was gazetted in May 1906. A weatherboard drill hall was erected, based on a specification dated 1 December 1906. The complex also included a well and a gun shed, with a harness room, workshop and cart room, erected in April 1911. Until 1901 Defence was the responsibility of each state. The Commonwealth Defence Act 1903-1904 constituted the legislative basis for the Australian Military System. The passing of the Defence Act in December 1909 introduced a universal training scheme based on the Swiss model which provided for the compulsory training of Junior and Senior cadets from the age of 12-18 and then for adult training. The Minister for Defence laid down the principal that \\"the cost of Drill Halls was to be put down to bedrock\\", since so many were required. This would appear to have resulted in the design of wood and iron drill halls. Before Federation all public works were undertaken by State Works Departments. Although the responsibility for the construction of public works was under the Public Works Branch of the Department of Home Affairs, many Commonwealth works were undertaken by the State Works Departments in the early years. From 1901 to 1910 drill halls were generally rented in each state or leased by the Commonwealth, with some purchased. The erection of the new drill hall in Armidale in 1906 appears to have been an exception, a result of the regional importance of Armidale in the 2nd Military District (NSW) and the inadequacy of the existing site. Between 1 January 1910 and 7 October 1913 14 drill halls were erected with one purchased in NSW. The Armidale Drill Hall was designed and erected by the Department of Public Works, New South Wales, according to plans and specifications prepared for the Director of Works by the New South Wales Government Architect's Office. The specification described the Drill Hall as a wooden building roofed with iron and containing a large Drill Hall and six officer's rooms and separate double wooden closets with concrete floors. The closets were to a standard design by the office of the Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon, dated 22 February 1900. Vernon as New South Wales Colonial Architect from 1890-1911 appears to have been responsible for the design of the drill hall and associated buildings. Bricks were to be laid in old English Bond with damp proof courses and hoop iron reinforcing. Air gratings were to be fixed for the sub floor spaces with slate steps to the outer doors set on brick risers. External cladding and carpentry were to be of hardwood the frame and roof timbers of Oregon or approved local pine. Architraves and mouldings were to be in redwood, floor boards tallow wood and lining boards in Kauri pine. The roof comprised four steel and timber trusses with cast iron jointing pieces which were to be made by the contractor. The patterns would remain the property of the Commonwealth. The roof is clearly described as hipped with gablets. The main entrance was to be covered by a pent roof formed by extending the main roof. Externally the hall was to be covered with rusticated mahogany weatherboards. The development of drill halls for training does not appear to have been fully implemented until 1912, when urgent discussions took place between the Department of Hoem Affairs and the Department of Home Affairs. This followed Parliament's decision to vote 80,000 pounds for the construction of drill halls, and for the purchase of suitable sites. At the suggestion of King O'Malley and the Department of Home Affairs, the selection and acquisition of land was undertaken jointly by the two Departments. A reference of 19 March 1913 reveals that standard plans, to four basic designs, had been sent to the Department of Defence by the Department of Home Affairs to expedite the construction of drill halls. In addition existing drill halls were in some instances enlarged to provide extra accommodation. In 1913 the drill hall at the Hunter River Lancers Training Depot was extended, by the addition of a skillion at one end, to include three offices on brick foundations. In 1922 the drill hall was described as a Type 4 in a survey of drill halls, by the Commonwealth. This referred to the standard Commonwealth designs of 1913 with Type 4's 60x30 feet with a 12 foot skillion down one side. Latrines and a small arms range were also accommodated on the site in addition to a parade ground on the Allingham Street frontage in preparation for a possible international conflict. Armidale served as the training area for the 4th Brigade, 13th Battalion and was later the HQ of the 33rd Battalion and the 12th Light Horse. In 1906 the 4th and 6th Australian Light Horse were renamed the \\"Hunter River Lancers\\" and the \\"New England Light Horse\\". In 1918 both units were redesignated to become the 16th Light Horse and the 12th Light Horse (New England Light Horse) respectively. Members of both units saw active service with the AIF in the First World War as part of the Light Horse Regiments AIF. The 16th and 12th Light Horse were disbanded in 1943. During the Second World War 1939-45 the site was briefly used to accommodate Italian POWs. With the reformation of the Commonwealth Military Forces (CMF) in 1948 the 12/16 Hunter River Lancers Regiment was formed and was equipped with Matilda tanks. In 1952 the tanks were replaced with Staghound Armoured Cars. Following other changes the Regiment became an RAAC Regiment in 1972 comprising RHQ, HQ Squadron a Cavalry Squadron and an APC Squadron. During the 1950s the Workshop section of the former Gun Shed (now Q-Store) was used as accommodation by the Sergeant, with the Camp Cart and Gun Shed sections used as classrooms. A prefabricated Riley-Newsum house for the Warrant Officer Training was erected in the 1950s at the opposite end of the site. This now serves as a local museum and is fenced off from the remainder of the site. The depot is presently used by Defence for tank training and maintenance. At the rear of the site, building 7 houses the tanks, with a wash down area and maintenance bay. The former depot in Faulkner Street has been demolished and is no longer occupied by Defence. In 2001/2002 Gutteridge Haskins Davey undertook a heritage analysis of the Mann Street site with respect to Building 2, the Q-Store, which Defence wanted to replace with a new Q store (Quartermasters store). As at May 2002 this had not been demolished.  Description  Hunter River Lancers Training Depot is at allingham Street, corner Mann Street, Armidale, comprising the Drill Hall, Q-Store (former Gun Shed), and Parade Ground. The depot site, comprising blocks 10, 11 and 12, is surrounded by modern development including town houses. The site is close to the railway line and station as well as the main Grafton Road, illustrating the prominent siting given to drill halls in the urban landscape. In common with many drill halls and training depots, the buildings were arranged along the boundaries of the site to maximise site utilisation. The site slopes from south to north towards Mann Street. This slope appears to have resulted in the Drill Hall being sited at the rear of the block in order to maintain functional open space, the parade ground, in front of the hall, visible from both Allingham and Mann Streets. Drill Halls were seen as part of a setting designed to achieve prominence in the streetscape. The former Gun Shed, now the Q-Store, was also sited at the rear of the block adjacent to a small laneway, for servicing and proximity to the Railway Station. The depot comprises 5 main structures: the Drill Hall (1); the Q-Store, former Gun Shed (2); tank garages and wash-down areas (7); former Warrant Officers House; and a modern demountable (8). The former Warrant Officers House has been adapted considerably both internally and externally and is of relatively low integrity. Structures and sites above the threshold for inclusion in the Register include buildings 1 and 2 and the area of the former parade ground on the north side of the Drill Hall, which provides a functional and spatial context for the Drill Hall. The separation of the Drill hall and Q-Store is characteristic of the layout of such training depots. The Drill Hall, located at the south east corner of the site, is generically similar in design to the Gladesville Drill Hall erected in 1900 by the NSW Colonial Government. However, the hipped roof with gablets contrasts strongly with the gabled forms employed in NSW, and is generically similar to early designs employed by the Commonwealth, which reflected the prevailing Federation style adopted later by Commonwealth architects such as John Smith Murdoch. The draft Drill Halls Data Base (as at May 2002), compiled by Allom Lovell, Architects, for Defence, describes the drill hall as follows. > 'The Hall is standard 60x30 dimension and originally would have had offices > at each end. Skillion roofed offices and armoury have been added to south > and beyond this an extension to the armoury and toilets at the south west > corner. More recent extensions have been made on the west and for recreation > facilities. The roof is Dutch gable form and recently clad in corrugated > Colorbond with the original roof profile changed. The ridge ventilators have > been removed. The building is clad externally with rusticated weatherboard > and the windows are double hung timber on the east and pivot type on the > north. The double hall doors are timber with glazed top panel. The interior > walls are lined with Masonite over the original timber boards. The open roof > trusses are unique and constructed with 6x4 inch top chords and a network of > 4x4 inch timber braces and single and paired 5/8 inch iron rods connected > with cast iron joint fixings.' It would appear that the roof profile has not been changed with respect to the original specification of 1906, merely recovered with the loss of the original ridge ventilators. The Gun Shed, now the Q-Store, comprises four rooms: the Gun Shed originally dirt floor now concrete; the Camp carts section with concrete (originally dirt) floor; the Harness room with timber floor; and the Workshop section with timber floor. The building features hardwood stumps, hardwood floor, wall and framing structure, tallowwood flooring and Oregon doors. Internally the building has lost evidence of the original fittings including shelving and saddle brackets. The Gun Shed and Camp Cart sections are now lined with asbestos cement sheeting. The gabled roof is covered with corrugated galvanised iron.  Condition and integrity  Both the Q-Store and the Drill hall are in good condition (April 2002) The Drill has been reroofed in Colorbond and extended at one end. The extensions and changes illustrate the adaptation of the drill hall in the lead up to the First World War to bring the hall up to standard and the changes required to incorporate an armoury and new toilets. Overall the building is of relatively high integrity when compared to the original design. The Q-Store has been adapted by the insertion of concrete floors to replace dirt floors. Internal fittings have been lost. (April 2002)  Heritage listing  The Hunter River Lancers Training Depot was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 with the following rationale: The Hunter River Lancers Training Depot in Mann Street, Armidale, acquired in 1904, is important for its association with the early implementation of military training under the Commonwealth following the 1903 Defence Act and with Armidale's Light Horse military history. The Drill Hall (1906), Q-Store (former Gun Shed 1911) and the Parade Ground are important in illustrating the role of the New South Wales Department of Public Works in erecting buildings designed by the Government Architect's Office, New South Wales, under Walter Liberty Vernon as Government Architect 1890-1911, for the Commonwealth Government, in the years leading up to the First World War. The Drill Hall and former Gun Shed are of exceptional interest as unusual and surviving examples of weatherboard military buildings designed by the New South Wales Government Architect and erected by the Department of Public Works for the Commonwealth, before the implementation of standard designs in 1913. The Drill Hall and Q-Store are important in illustrating the principal characteristics of the siting, layout and design of drill halls and associated buildings for citizens militia training. The simple rectangular buildings are located on a prominent site close to the railway and main road, the stores at the rear. The drill hall and Q-Store are of stud framed weatherboard construction, with timber floors and corrugated galvanised iron roofs. The Drill Hall and former Gun Shed in Hunter River Lancers Training Depot are highly valued by members of the community for their cultural and social associations.  References   Bibliography  * 1.

His artistic talents first came to the attention of Laurentio di Rossi, an artist of Venetian origin who was serving as a court painter in Saxony, while Kern was attending the Jesuit school in . Rossi was sufficiently impressed to take him home to his studio in Dresden and give him lessons. In 1723, Rossi took him to Italy and secured him an apprenticeship with Giambattista Pittoni. He remained with Pittoni for seven years, although he also took lessons at various public and private schools. He returned to Bohemia in 1731, accompanied by Laurentio's brother, Ventura. Four years later, he was officially registered as a \\"Pictor\\" at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague. In 1738, he was summoned to Dresden, where he received several commissions related to the wedding of Princess Maria Amalia and King Charles VII of Naples (later Charles III of Spain).Biography from the Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich @ WikiSource, He made numerous sketches for altar and ceiling paintings at the court church that were never executed. That same year, Frederick Augustus II, the Elector of Saxony, presented him with a scholarship to study in Rome, where he may have worked with Francesco Trevisani. Upon his return in 1741, he was appointed a court painter. He died in Dresden. His most important work there was an altarpiece featuring an enthroned Virgin Mary, surrounded by St. Anthony, St. John of Nepomuk and St. Wenceslaus; which shows the influence of Johann Christoph Lischka. In his last years, he turned to mythological subjects and developed stylistic elements that would later become part of the Rococo style. In 1747 he became ill, with an unknown ailment, and died the same day. His older brother, Benedict (1704-c.1777), was also an artist and court painter in Saxony, who specialized in landscapes and restorations. References Further reading * Kl√†ra Garas (1969).

At its peak, the Chero kingdom extended from Varanasi in the west to Patna in the east and from Bihar Sharif in the north and Kaimur in the south. They established principalities in the Shahabad, Saran, Champaran, Muzzafarpur and Palamu. Bihea was capital of Chero Chief Ghughulia. Tirawan in Bhojpur region was second capital where Raja Sitaram Rai, the son of Raja Ram Rai was ruling chief. Chainpur was capital of third principalities where Raja Salabahim as its ruler. In Sasaram, the capital was Deo Markande with Raja Phulchand as chief. History Origin Chero claims to have originally been tribal Kshatriyas. Other members claim to be Nagvanshi. Some Chero claim descent from the sage Chyavana.People of India Bihar Volume XVI Part One edited by S Gopal & Hetukar Jha pages 229 to 231 Seagull Books Chero rose to power in 12th century after fall of Pala Empire. Conflict with Afghans According to Ahmad Yadgar, Sher Shah Suri wanted to take possession of a White elephant from Maharata Chero. On refusal of Maharata Chero, Sher Shah dispatched Khawas Khan with 4000 horses against the Raja. The Chero chief was besieged and compelled to surrender the elephant and Khawas Khan captured huge booty. According to Abbas Sarwani, the author of Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi the Maharata Chero became so powerful in Shahabad that Sher Shah had to send Khawas Khan to lead an expedition against him. Due to battle of Chausa, the campaign was suspended. Soon after the battle of Chausa, Sher Shah dispatched Khawas Khan and Chero chief was defeated and killed. Rebellion against the Mughals In 1590, Man Singh after suppressing chief of Kharagpur and Gidhour, attacked Anant Chero of Palamu. Cheros offered strong resistance to invading army but they were outnumbered. A large number of them were killed and many taken as prisoners. Raja Man Singh captured valuable booty including fifty four elephants. Palamu brought under Mughal administration. Soon after death of Akbar, Anant Chero drove out imperial troops out and declared his independence. In 1607, Jahangir ordered an expedition against Anant Chero. Mughal officials launched repeated attacks on Cheros and Chero had to shift their capital into deep jungle. The Cheros of Palamu began to grow in power again in the 17th century and under the leadership of Pratap Rai, they started to raid cattle from neighbouring Mughal districts. Because of this, Shah Jahan sent the Mughal Governor of Bihar, Shaista Khan, on an expedition to subdue the Cheros and stop the rebellion from taking place. During this expedition, the Mughals had trouble reaching the Chero stronghold in Palamu due to the hilly and forested terrain which made it almost inaccessible. Eventually, after 6 months the Mughals managed to surround the Palamu Forts and Pratap Rai surrendered which the Mughals accepted. War with the Ujjainiyas The Cheros had lost their territory in Western Bihar in the 14th century to the invading Ujjainiya Rajputs who were under the leadership of Hunkar Sahi. In the ensuing battles, both sides suffered many casualties with the Cheros losing more than 10,000 men. In 1607, a number of Chero chief combined to launch a spirited attacks against Ujjaniniyas. One of the descendants of Sitaram Rai, Kumkum Chand Jharap drove out Ujjainiyas from Bhojpur region and capture major parts of territory. The Ujjainiyas could not offer much resistance because their chief Raja Narayan Mal who had usurped the throne after disposing Raja Mukut Mani in 1607, had gone to Mughal court to get his confirmation as the rulers of Ujjainiyas from Jahangir. He brought these developments to the notice of emperor and also got assurance of imperial support against the Cheros. Immediately after return, he raised his headquarters at Buxar, regrouped the Ujjainiyas and started making efforts to capture the lost territory. Kum Kum Chand Jharap upon realising he would not able to resist the onslaught of Narayan Mal alone for long, appealed Cheros of Sonpari reign for his help. Large numbers of Cheros led by Raja of Khaddar, Anandichak and Balaunja (Japla) joined Kum Kum Chand Jharap. They repaired the trenches around the Tirawan forts, and reinforced it with war materials. The rival armies faced each other for twenty-one days. On twenty-second day Cheros made determined attacks on the Ujjaniyas. The Ujjaniyas move cautiously firmly behind their shield and succeeded in repulsing Cheros from their position. They move further and launched surprise attacks on the fort of Tirawan. The besieged were under tremendous pressure because of shortage of foods and war materials. The morals of besieged was so low that they contemplating vacating the fort. Fortunately, Raja Madha Mundra of Lohardaga came to help them. Then Cheros fought bravely and foiled the attempt of Ujjaniyas to capture the fort. A large number of Ujjaniyas killed or force to retreat. Pratap Singh, the brother of Narayan Mal was in front of retreating Ujjaniya army. Chero mistook him for Narayan Mal and surround him. At that time, Thakur Rai Kalyan Singh, the Bakshi of Mughal imperial army who had been left at Buxar by Narayan Mal with half the army reached Bhojpur and joined them. Words spread in the camp that imperial army had arrived to help the Ujjaniyas. Chero once again demoralised however they continue their struggle. On the other hand, with this new reinforcement Narayan Mal attack on Cheros from all four sides with renewed vigour. Chero too responded vigorously. All male member joined the battle and women help them by throwing stones with slings. A fierce fight ensued and the commander of both the armies showed great valour. The Ujjaniyas succeeded in defeating the Cheros. A large number of Cheros, including Sharan Jharap the Raja of Lohardaga, Haratpal and Raja Madha Mundra, were killed in the battle. A huge booty came into possession of Ujjaniyas. Deogaon and Kothi the forts of cheros razed to the ground. The battle was fought in 1611 on ninth day of Dusshera. Narayan Mal was indisputably accepted as leader of Ujjaniyas. He destroyed the power of Cheros and expelled them from Bhojpur region. After ruling for decades Narayan Mal was killed by his own kinsmen in a family feud. Rule in Palamu Palamu Forts The Chero rule in Palamu region was established by Bhagwant Rai after overthrowing the Raksel dynasty. After Bhagwant Rai, Bhupal Rai and Medini Rai ruled Palamu. Medini Rai constructed new fort. After death of Medini Rai, the dynasty fell apart due to power struggle and in-fighting in the ruling family. the administration slowly and indirectly passed into hand of various ministers and advisers who were driven by personal gain and fame. Then Pratap Rai, Rudra Rai, Dikpal Rai, Saheb Rai, Ranjit Rai, Devi Batesh Rai and Jai Kishan Rai ruled Palamu. In 1770, the Chitrajeet Rai became 12th Raja of Chero dynasty after the 11th Raja Jai Kishan Rai, died at Chetna ghat fighting a defiant adviser. Two candidates claiming to be the rightful Raja, one Gopal Rai, grandson of Jaikishan Rai, the other Chitrajit Rai, grandson of the murdered ruling chief Ranjit Rai, brought their suits to the British. The British, more interested in revenue collection than in family quarrels, decided to occupy the fort of Palamu. As Chitrajit's Dewan, Jainath Singh, refused to agree to this even in return for recognition of Chitrajit's claim, the controlling council at Patna decided to support the cause of Goapl Rai. The Nephew of Raja, Gopal Rai immediately created animosity with Raja Chitrajeet Rai and started divulging to British which help them to interfere in the rule of Chero in the Palamu. On 9 January 1771, British East India company ordered Palamu to hand over the fort to Company. Raja Chitrajeet Rai's deewan asked 10 days to do so. On 10th day, Captain Camac of Patna Council asked to lead a contingent against Raja. On 28 January 1771, Captain Camac and his force laid siege to the fort. On 29 January, he sent a message to Raja asking him to surrender the fort to the East India company. But the Valiant Cheros refused, vowing to fight on to death to protect their Raja and the fort. The Chero warriors stationed at new fort returned to the old fort due to water scarcity. This provided opportunity to British force to occupy the new fort. Since the new fort was located on the hillock, it allowed Captain Camac an opportunity to gauge to actual strength of Chero warriors stationed inside the old fort. Sensing inadequacy of forces and resources, Captain Camac sent a message to his commander at Patna to send heavier cannon and shells. On meanwhile, the gallant Cheros kept the British ground forces on the defensive with their continuous shelling from the top of the old fort. On 2 February 1771, the British reinforcements with their 6-pound cannons and extra rations were attacked by the Cheros, who made away with rations and killed some soldiers. This forced captain Camac to ask for additional 12 cannons and more rations. On 4 February 1771, Chero again intercepted British force on their way to Palamu, looted the rations and killed many soldiers. By 7 February, Captain Camac was on the point of retreating. His soldiers attempted to scale the wall of old fort under cover of darkness but Cheros foiled all such efforts. In the meantime another 12 pound cannons with ammunition and extra reinforcements reached the fort. By 19 March 1771, the old fort was surrounded by a numerically superior British force. The besieged fort was then shelled by British force but outer wall was so strong and well fortified that they failed to demolish it in order to gain entry. At this point, the captain Camac cleverly sought the help of Akhauri Udwant Rai, promising to establish him as future king with plenty of wealth. Akhauri Rai helped Camec contact a man called Sugandh Rai, who knew a secret point to entry into the fort. When Raja Medini Rai was rebuilding the old fort, he had built a corner outer wall using mud mortar, so that in an emergency his people could escape breaking through this part of the wall. The secret entrance to the fort was divulged to the Captain Camac, who immediately stationed his 12-pound cannon there and shelled continuously. Finally breaking through the advance into the fort. On 21 March 1771, Camec led his soldiers in defeating the soldiers and capturing the fort. British installed Gopal Rai as King on the agreeing to pay an annual tribute of Rs. 12,000. The Dewan of Palamu, Raj Jainath Singh returned from Ramgarh and reorganized the Cheros. In April 1772, they renewed their attack on the British force. To contain the determined onslaught of the Cheros, Leutinant Thomas Scot was sent with a strong additional force. Nevertheless, the 400 cheros and Kharwars proved too strong for British. On 26 April, after sergeant Pelwin was killed and Lieutenant Scot badly injured, the British force gave up and the fort was recaptured by the Cheros. Gopal Rai was removed after a trial in 1776. His minor brother Biswanath succeeded him and Gajraj Rai became the manager. But their position was assailed by Sugandh Rai and Sheo Prasad Singh. The Governor ordered that Bishwanth Rai, the third brother of Gopal Rai and not Gajraj or Sugandh, was the successor. Since this order was resisted Major Grawford was sent to Palamu with military force to restore peace. Major Crawford managed to capture Gajraj and Sugandha. Raja Bishwanath Rai died in 1783. he was followed by Churaman Rai. His action provoked the tenantry, and led to the Chero insurrection in 1800. The leader was Bhukhan Singh, a Chero. The British came with a force and suppressed the insurrection but by that time the Raja and the administration had been reduced to bankruptcy. An Assistant Collector of Bihar was appointed to look after the revenue collection in the western part of the province. Parry, the Assistant Collector who took over in 1811 made the first settlement of revenue in 1812. he annulled the Sanad, granted by Churaman Rai and took over direct collection. The Palamu estate was attacked. In 1812, the sale of Palamu estate was authorized and it was accordingly sold for Rs. 51,000. The assessment of the estate was reduced to Rs. 9,000 in 1814 when it was granted to Ghanshyam Singh of Deo as a reward to his help to the British in suppressing the Cheros and the Kharwars.

Durgabai‚Äôs artistic career has flourished even further not only by her marriage to Subhash Vyam but also by the veteran Gond Artist, Jangarh Singh Shyam, her cousin. Durgabai and Subash together take workshops and teach participants the integral elements of Gond painting while pointing out the changes brought by modernization in their medium of painting. Impressed by Durgabai‚Äôs skills, Jangarh Singh Shyam, encouraged and advised her not to repeat what they had done for years but use their skills to show new things. Her subjects are rooted in tribal folklore and mythology and are drawn mainly from the pantheon of the Gond Pradhan community and popular folklore. She also painted several goddesses: Ratmaimurkhuri, the guardian of the night; Maharalin Mata, who wardedoff ghouls from entering villages; Khero Mata, protector against evil people; Budi Mai, patroness of the harvest; and Kulsahinmata, a goddess invoked when crop was sown. Durga also painted the males gods, Bada Dev,the supreme god, and Chula Dev, who ensured that the household chulha (hearth) always burns. > \\"The themes I have always liked to paint are rivers, trees ‚Äîespecially the > bamboo tree which is vital to life because from it is made Bada Dev's > musical instrument bana and the bansuri,flute ‚ÄîDiwali celebrations, > kanyadan, houses and children, animals such as tiger, deer, stag with > antlers, peacock, bull, garden lizard, pig, birds sitting on top of trees > while animals sit below.\\" In 1996, Anand Singh Shyam, a fellow Gond artist, invited her to exhibit her works at Bharat Bhawan in Madhya Pradesh. Since then, Durgabai has notably had exhibitions in and around India and also abroad. Durga Bai did a series of paintings of aeroplanes in the Gond style to mark her first plane ride and her first visit abroad to the Frankfurt Book Fair. Each of her paintings is inspired by archetypal scenes of Gond Mythology, creating the unbridled lyricism and audacious imagination of her signature style. In 2003, Vyam was invited to a workshop by Tara Publishing in Chennai, and has since been illustrating books. She has contributed to illustrate several art books like 'The Night Life of Trees', 'One, Two, Tree!', 'Sultana's Dream'. In 2011, Durgabai and Subhash Vyam published a graphic biography of Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar titled 'Bhimayana: Experiences of Untouchability' published by Navayana. In the ongoing Kochi Muziris Biennale 2018, the artist couple has created an experimental graphic narrative on marine plywood giving the traditional Gond wall art another dimension.

He stars, alongside Major Sundarrajan, Kishmoo, Ramesh Aravind, Kasthuri, Sangeetha and Vadivukkarasi. The film was released on 14 August 1992, and failed commercially.  Plot  Shanmugam lives with his wife Vadivu and three children ‚Äì Uma, Mala and Narayanan. Shanmugam has great respect for his elder brother (Major Sundarrajan), a widower. A small flashback is shown where Sundarrajan‚Äôs wife passes away during their child birth. Sundarrajan decides to give his baby to an orphanage as he thinks it is impossible to grow a child without mother. But Shanmugam and Vadivu come for rescue. They adopt Sundarrajan‚Äôs baby and raise her as their eldest daughter. The child is none other than Uma. However, the elders decide to keep this as a secret not informing their children. Gomathi is the younger sister of Sundarrajan and Shanmugam but is expelled from their home long back for marrying a man of her choice who happens to be Kamalanathan, a marriage broker. Meena is their only daughter. Kamalanathan is financially backward and the couple strive hard to meet their ends. Although the elders maintain enmity, Uma and Meena are good friends. Meena is employed in a beach resort but she also happens to be the concubine of the resort owner who is already married to a rich woman living in the US. Uma also secures a job of receptionist in the same beach resort. James is the manager of the resort who is genuine and kind natured. Love blossoms between James and Uma. Hearing about this, Sundarrajan and Shanmugam get furious as they hate love marriages. But Uma stands firm in her decision of marrying James but only after getting the blessings of elders. Sundarrajan and Shanmugam decide to get the other two children married. Mala is married to Sanjay but Shanmugam hides the truth about Uma to Mala‚Äôs in-laws. Narayanan is in love with a girl and tactfully plays game by making it as an arranged marriage with the help of the girl‚Äôs parents. On the day of marriage, Kamalanathan takes revenge on Sundarrajan and Shanmugam by disclosing about Uma‚Äôs love affair to Mala‚Äôs in-laws which makes them feel cheated. Also, he informs to Shanmugam about Narayanan‚Äôs plan of making a love marriage into an arranged one. Kamalanathan feels happy for avenging his anger over Sundarrajan and Shanmugam.

This makes Kamalanathan realize his mistake. He takes care of Meena at the same time, decides to solve the problems at Shanmugam‚Äôs house created by him. Mala returns back to Shanmugam‚Äôs house as her husband often suspects her virginity. Also, Narayanan has a quarrel with his wife and in-laws. Uma meets Mala‚Äôs mother in-law and sorts out the problem. With the help of Meena, she helps Narayan to patch up with his wife. James discloses about his love to his parents for which they agree but on a condition that they should get married in two weeks-time. Uma patiently waits for the approval of Sundarrajan and Shanmugam but they are very stubborn. After two weeks, James comes to a register office with his parents expecting Uma to be there as well. Kamalanathan plans to meet Sundarrajan and Shanmugam and try to convince them. But Meena gets labour pain and is admitted in the hospital. Meena requests Kamalanathan to first help Uma for which he agrees. Kamalanathan goes to Shanmugam‚Äôs house and tries all means to convince them but in vain. Finally, Kamalanathan reveals the truth to Uma, that she is actually the daughter of Sundarrajan but raised by Shanmugam which everyone thinks to be a secret. Uma, to their surprise says that she knew the truth when she was in school itself with the help of Meena but she pretended not knowing it as she does not want her family elders feel bad. Uma requests Sundarrajan and Shanmugam to agree for her wedding with James. Sundarrajan and Shanmugam agree and their wedding takes place. But Meena passes away during child birth.

She was the first Thai woman to receive a degree in medicine.  Early life and education  Margaret Lin Xavier was born on 29 May 1898 in Bangkok, Thailand (then Siam), to Celestino Maria Xavier, known as Phraya Sri Phipat Kosa, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Kim Kee. She was sent to study at the Holy Sacred Heart of Jesus Convent in Singapore. Upon her father's foreign posting as the Thai ambassador to Italy, Xavier entered Clark's Commercial College in London. She then passed matriculation and entered the London School of Medicine for Women and the Royal Free Hospital. She obtained an MBBS, MRCS, and LRCP.  Career  Following her father's death, Xavier returned to Thailand in 1924 and became an obstetrician and worked for the Thai Red Cross Society, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, and the medical facility in Bang Rak District under the Ministry of Public Health. She also established a medical clinic called \\"Unakan\\" with her half sister Chan Xavier as the clinic's pharmacist. Xavier tended to patients of all social classes, not only Thai aristocracy. As the Bang Rak medical facility was for treatment of sexually-transmitted diseases, many of her patients were impoverished sex workers, whom she would treat free of charge. Even when she was breastfeeding, Margaret still continued to work, going home to breastfeed in the middle of the work day and returning to work in the afternoon. She opted to breastfeed the children herself, despite the fact that a woman of her status during that time would have employed the help of a wet nurse. A highlight of Xavier's career occurred on 12 August 1932, when she delivered Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, who would become Queen Sirikit, the queen consort of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (or Rama IX) and the mother of King Vajiralongkorn (or Rama X).  Personal life   Marriage to Phraya Srivisanvaja  Xavier married Phraya Srivisaravaja on 15 August 1926. He would become the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand in 1932. She was bestowed the title of Khun Ying Srivisanvaja. They had two daughters, Than Phu Ying Manasanit Vannikul (n√©e Srivisanvaja) and Khun Ying Sawitree Srivisanvaja, and one son, Kittirat Srivisanvaja.  Death  Xavier contracted encephalitis and died due to complications of influenza on 6 December 1932. She was 34.  Tribute  On 29 May 2020, Google celebrated her life with a Google Doodle.

Nearly twenty new Scottish convents would be established in the next 50 years.

Opening  The bridge was inaugurated on 9 July 2016, which was marked by the release of hundreds of fireworks and lanterns by the Mayor of Surabaya after pressing the button to sign the inauguration of the Suroboyo Bridge.  Critics  The bridge project was criticized by members of the Surabaya city council because it was assessed without good planning. An economic lecturer from Airlangga University, Nisful Laila, believes that the Kenjeran bridge is inefficient. Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology's urban planning expert Putu Rudy Setiawan added that the construction of the Kenjeran Bridge was lacking in planning. At the time, the Head of the Public Works and Public Works Office of the Surabaya City Highways and Eradication Office, Erna Purnawati, denied various arguments that the Kenjeran Bridge was built to advance the tourism sector in Surabaya.

Early life  Monica arrived in Rangoon in 1937 with her Burmese husband. She lived through World War II and Japanese occupation while working as a hospital nurse. It was when the war ended that she was appointed to the British Council's library staff. Since 2011 when the British Council reopened after an upgrade, it has been thriving as the only public library free of censorship in a country of 60 million population.  Contributions  Preservation of Burmese scholarly literature She worked as a deputy librarian of the British Council, which was located by Strand Road in Rangoon. In 1962, the Burmese military dictator and his troops overran the library and ordered to have the books sold off. Monica hastily hid 200 books in the British Embassy to save them from the coup which General Ne Win orchestrated. Her intervention had contributed to the preservation of Burmese scholarly literature which made her a recipient of the 1979 MBE. Today, the books she protected are compiled and named after her as 'Mrs Monica Mya Maung Collection' in the British Council Library in Myanmar.  English tuition legacy  The local Burmese addressed her as \\"Auntie Monica\\" out of affection because she was also offering private tutoring sessions in 1950s. It was the beginning of the English tuition legacy which is widely prevalent in modern Yangon. Auntie Monica taught English part-time all the way through her 90s, even past her retirement after working at the British Council and the British Embassy for a total of 38 years.

Because of conscientious objection in some countries, even if abortion is legal, it is difficult for women to find non-objecting gynaecologists and thus to access abortion. By country Americas United States Europe thumb|Conscientious objection to abortion in selected European countries |alt=|331x331px Conscientious objection is granted in 22 member states of the European Union plus the United Kingdom, Norway and Switzerland. It is not granted in Sweden, Finland, Bulgaria and Iceland. The right of member states to enact legislation that limit the right to conscientious objection to abortion was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights in March 2020. Croatia Doctors and other medical personnel have the right to conscientious objection. Rada Boriƒá (Women's Network Croatia) has argued that it is given more prominence than the women's right to abortion, thus making it difficult. On February 21, 2017 the Constitutional Court ordered the Parliament to enact new abortion law within two years, introducing educational and preventive measures to make abortion an exception and not a rule, and to regulate conscientious objection.  Czech Republic  In the Czech Republic since 2011 doctors and medical personnel can choose not to perform an abortion or prescribe any contraceptive (called V√Ωhrada svƒõdom√≠). But if a doctor refuse to perform an abortion they have to refer the patient to another doctor who can perform it. Hungary In 2013 the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women of the United Nations expressed concern about \\"the increasing resort to conscientious objection by health professionals in the absence of an adequate regulatory framework.\\" Ireland Under section 22 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 medical practitioners, nurses and midwives have the right not to participate in abortions, except when there is a risk to life or health of the pregnant woman in emergency. They also have to make arrangements to enable the woman to get an abortion. Italy The law gives the option for health professionals to claim the right to refuse to perform abortion. If the health personnel demands to be conscientious objector, they have to declare it in advance (Art.9). However, conscientious objection may not be invoked by health professionals if the personal intervention is essential in order to save the life of a woman in imminent danger. Italy keeps a record of the objecting doctors. According to data from the Ministry of Health, between 1997 and 2016 there was a 12.9% increase in the number of gynecologists who refuse to perform abortions on moral grounds, from 62.8% to 70.9%, the highest percentage ever recorded. As of 2016 the percentage is higher than the national average in Southern Italy (83.5%) and Sicily and Sardinia (77.7%), and lower in Central (70.1%) and Northern Italy (63.9%). The percentage is growing in all the macroregions except the North. As a result, voluntary abortion is performed only in 60% of the hospitals of the country. Also, non- objecting doctors suffers discrimination, and -in some provinces- needs to perform record-numbers of abortions, up to 15.8 per week in the province of Taranto (Apulia) or 12.2 in the province of Catania (Sicily). A resolution by the Council of Europe has found several violations of the European Social Charter in the situation: * right to protection of health (art. 11) of women seeking abortion; * right to work (art. 1) and to dignity at work (art. 26) of non-objecting medical practitioners, because of different treatment and moral harassment. Poland The Constitutional Tribunal \\"abolished a requirement that medical professionals who refuse to provide health services refer patients to an alternate medical provider\\". Portugal Abortion was legalised in Portugal in 2007. The law allows conscientious objection and many doctors refuse to perform abortion, making it difficult for women to access it. United Kingdom In England and Wales and Scotland medical staff has the right to refuse to participate in abortion because of conscientious objection.

It was written in 1995 and premiered as part of the Last Night of the Proms on 16 September 1995 at the Royal Albert Hall, London. At the premiere the solo saxophone part was played by John Harle, the drum kit by Paul Clarvis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Andrew Davis. It was commissioned by John Drummond in his last season as director of The Proms. Its full name is Panic: A Dithyramb for alto saxophone, jazz drummer, wind, brass and percussion. The title indicates both the nature of the music and the fact that it is a representation of the Classical Greek god Pan. Structure and style The piece is scored for solo alto saxophone, jazz drum kit, 3 flutes (nos. 2 & 3 doubling piccolo), 3 oboes (no. 3 doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets in B (no. 2 doubling clarinet in E), bass clarinet, 3 bassoons (no. 3 doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 4 trumpets (no. 1 doubling piccolo trumpet), 3 trombones, tuba, timpani and percussion. The playing time is approximately 18 minutes. The score is prefaced by a quotation from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem A Musical Instrument: Harrison Birtwistle has said of the piece: The music is heavily focussed on the solo saxophone which plays almost uninterruptedly throughout, at times seeming to overwhelm the accompanying wind and percussion. Some commentators have noted that the saxophone is clearly identified with Pan himself (\\"there appears little doubt about the soloist's identification with the work's protagonist\\"). The overall style of the music has been described as \\"raucous\\", \\"violen[t]\\", \\"wild\\" and \\"chaotic\\".

Although the Proms has a tradition of premiering new music, the Last Night was traditionally associated with 'safe' traditional patriotic pieces such as Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Gloryhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgnq6d-IjUs. Subsequently the BBC was reported to have received \\"thousands\\" of complaints. Some newspaper comments were scathing, chiefly from non-music journalists who had their attention drawn to it because of its prominent scheduling. The Daily Mail branded it a \\"horrible cacophony\\", the Daily Express said it was \\"unmitigated rubbish\\", although John Harle has said that he \\"read a nice review on the Monday [following the concert]\\". There were in fact several positive notices by music journalists: Hilary Finch in The Times stated that the piece had \\"tremendous, unremitting energy\\".\\"All Quiet on the Chariot of Fire\\", The Times, Monday September 18, 1995 Robert Maycock in The Independent stated that \\"John Harle played it with astonishing physical and expressive power, and the drummer, Paul Clarvis, matched precision with brilliance.\\"The Independent, Monday September 18, 1995 These more measured views have remained.

Opposition to it came from both first-wave feminists and fascists, who would often have connections to beliefs about racial purity in their condemnation of prostitution. Accusations of prostitution would also be made to damage political and social enemies. In the modern pre-Second Republic period, prostitution was illegal in Spain, though in the latter period, efforts were made to legalize it under the justification that it would assist in improving people's health by better addressing the spread of venereal disease. During the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, being a labeled a prostitute could be a disqualifier from participating in public life. Women in the CNT opposed prostitution as part of wider efforts related to women's emancipation. The Second Republic period saw Spaniards oppose prostitution as they argued in favor of racial purity arguments and maintained it led to the spread of venereal disease. Starting in 1931 and continuing through to 1935, the Second Republic adopted both an abolitionist and regulatory approach to appease both sides of the debate. During the Civil War, prostitution became an important issue for many women on the left to the confusion of foreign feminist allies. With women featuring heavily in propaganda on both sides, milicianas were accused by military and political leaders of being prostitutes and nymphomaniacs, in order to discredit their involvement on the front lines. Nationalist military members would often use female prostitutes on the home front. It is difficult to assess the extent of the problem of prostitution in the Franco period as lesbians, considered undesirable, were simply accused of being prostitutes.  Background  Accusations of prostitution have been used as slanders against women as a form of disempowerment dating back to the Christian Bible. Accusations of being a prostitute have also been used to define who is a \\"good woman\\" and who is a \\"bad woman.\\" False accusations would also be made to discredit social and political opponents.  Prostitution and feminism  Feminism from this period fostered a belief that women should work to better the state through the better nature of women, with their more caring and nurturing natures. This extended into the domain of having greater ability to control their own reproductive activities by virtue of being the ones who gave birth. First-wave feminism in Spain started around 1850 and continued until around 1950. Middle- class and upper-class women in early Spain became feminists as they became more self-aware of the inequalities they faced as a result of men viewing them as intellectually inferior. Ideologically, first-wave feminism was diverse in its approach to dealing with problems faced by women but generally centered around providing women with access to education and participation in public life as part of a broader strategy to demonstrate women's intellectual capabilities. This wave largely ended internationally as a result of achievements in gaining universal suffrage, which had the underlying belief that women were intelligent enough to vote. It was highly influenced by socialism. In places like Portugal, first-wave feminist was sometimes called \\"corset feminism\\" because it came from middle-class women who could afford to buy corsets and other trappings of femininity. In contrast, second-wave feminism is defined more by women's liberation movements and equal rights efforts. This group wanted to do away with women's sexual repression that they associated with \\"bourgeois morality\\". First-wave feminism saw often itself opposed to prostitution on the grounds women were morally and spiritually superior than men, and they served important roles of protecting men in society by acting as moral and spiritual gatekeepers. Opposition to prostitution was also on the grounds that banning prostitution was needed to protect women and children from abuse committed by men. In yet other contexts, opposition to prostitution was about the need to redeem women's morality. For some, mostly in the United States and Catholic parts of Europe including Spain, opposition to prostitution was on the grounds that it was little more than part of a white slave trade and to improve the purity of society. Those arguing against prostitution because of white slavery were often separated from the broader first-wave feminist movement.  Fascism and prostitution  Fascism sometimes supported regulated prostitution. Opposition to prostitution was much more frequent, often because of a belief that legalization of prostitution would result in a surge of men getting sexually transmitted diseases. In other cases, it was opposed as a violation of religious beliefs. Many fascists in this period believed that women were defined around reproduction. Thus, the greatest opposition to prostitution often involved a belief that prostitution represented a deep moral and racial crisis. Fascists would slander political enemies of being or supporting prostitutes, as demonstrated through the spread of venereal disease which hurt a country on the whole. Jews in multiple countries would be accused of supporting prostitution.  Prelude to the Second Republic (1800‚Äì1922)  Prostitution had been illegal in Spain since 1864, with varying periods with changing legal statutes. Prostitution was legal in pre-Second Republic Spain. Trying to legalize prostitution was difficult, because the bans for it in the mid-19th century existed on the provisional level so a national solution was not easily attainable though local police did have lists of prostitutes. This was eventually solved by treating prostitution as a health crisis and creating the Special Regulation of the Service of Hygiene of Prostitution in 1905 by the Real Consejo de Sanidad. National police were charged with enforcing it in its first year, before local police took over the job in 1909 with police listings being problematic as some women were listed as prostitutes who offered their services for free. Prostitution was legalized in Spain in a move viewed as very progressive by male leadership at the time. It was viewed as a way to isolate venereal disease and to provide a natural way for men to relieve their urges while protecting women more broadly and the honor of Spanish families. By legalizing prostitution, the government also hoped to curb male masturbation and homosexuality. Meanwhile, poor, white women had to fear being trafficked as slaves. The 1870 Penal Code had allowed for pimping and prostitution. It was modified in 1904 to make pimping illegal. Sumptuary laws in Spain in this period meant prostitutes were able to wear articles of clothing and jewelry that more respectable, moral women could not. The International Agreement 1904 signed in Paris required the Spanish government to monitor for the trafficking of women at railway stations and ports. If prostitutes were found trying to enter Spain from abroad, they were supposed to be repatriated to their home countries. In 1918, venereal disease began to be recognized as a real problem in Spanish society and a few clinics began allowing prostitutes to use them to avoid the spread of these infections. Specialized clinics for venereal disease would begin to spread around the country starting in 1920. Later laws said people with venereal disease could be required by doctors to undergo involuntary treatment for it. Real Patronato para la Represi√≥n de la Trata de Blancas was created in 1902 to fight prostitution and the spread of venereal disease in Spain, being overseen by Queen Consort Maria Cristina. It would continue until 1931, and, outside the Queen Regent, the board had mostly male membership or women of aristocratic birth with little interest in the topic. Their primary activity was reporting alleged prostitutes to the police, and then trying to get these women to stop by putting them into a shelter. Margarita Nelken was particularly critical of their efforts in this period, seeing the organization as highly ineffectual in helping women. The Sociedad Espa√±ola del Abolicionismo was created in 1922 by C√©sar Juarros, the first organization of its kind seeking the abolition of prostitution in Spain.  Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera (1923-1930)  The 8 March 1924 Royal Decree's Municipal Statue Article 51 for the first time included an appendix which would allow electoral authorities on a municipal level to list women over the age of 23 who were not controlled by male guardians or the state to be counted. Article 84.3 said unmarried women could vote in municipal elections assuming they were the head of household, over the age of 23, not prostitutes and their status did not change. Changes were made the following month that allowed women who met these qualifications to run for political office. During this period, CNT members in many places were required to meet clandestinely. Women continued to refine their positions during the Dictatorship of Primo de Reivera. In the 1920s, anarchist viewed women having fewer children, increased sex education and the elimination of prostitution as position that would provide resistance to institutions and ideologies they opposed, including capitalism, religion and the military. These changes would also emancipate women, by defining them around a task other than reproduction.  Second Spanish Republic (1931‚Äì1937)  There was opposition to prostitution in this period because of the belief that it destroyed the Spanish race and it led to the spread of venereal disease. Anarchist women condemned middle-class and upper-class women over their views on prostitution. Anarchists believed that they supported prostitution so the lower classes would be polluted, while middle and upper-class women could maintain their appearances of chastity. The Second Republic abolished Patronato para la Trata de Blancas by decree on 1 July 1931, and replaced it by decree on 11 September 1931 with Patronato de Protecci√≥n de la Mujer. This created a regulatory framework for the legalization of prostitution while at the same time putting Spain into compliance with international agreements and more broadly promised to work towards the abolition of prostitution in Spain. The drafts of laws for the Second Republic as they related to prostitution were writing by S√°nchez Covisa, M√©ndez Bejarano, S√°inz de Aja, Bravo and Jim√©nez de As√∫a. In April 1932, all taxes on prostitution were eliminated, even if the intention of putting those funds towards anti-venereal services was used. This debate would continue through to 1935, as the Second Republic adopted both an abolitionist and regulatory approach to appease both sides of the debate. During one of these debates, Clara Campoamor took to the floor of the Congreso de Diputados, saying, The 1933, the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes removed homosexuality as a crime from the books, except among members of the military. Beggars, ruffians, pimps and prostitutes were still considered criminals. Passing on 4 August 1933, it was approved unanimously in the PSOE and Communist dominated Congreso de Diputados.  Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)  During the Civil War, some women resorted to prostitution because they were starving and had nothing else they could barter with. It was a decision of last resort as their husbands, brothers and fathers who supported them were killed during the war. Spanish authorities responded to this showing two faces at the same time, openly tolerating the practice while at the same time condemning only the women involved with it. During the war, entrenched gender roles continued to exist, alongside it included prostitution. Federica Montseny, in charge of the Public Health and Welfare portfolio from November 1936 to May 1937, started schools to assist prostitutes in learning new trades. Even after Nationalists took control of an area, the Second Republic regulatory system for prostitution continued and would not end until the official end of the war.  Mujeres Libres  Mujeres Libres became one of the most important women's anarchist organizations during the Civil War. Their Civil War ranks were aided by women moving over from CNT to participation in their organization. One of their biggest struggles during the Civil War was around fighting prostitution. Education was viewed a key aspect of this, as they believed educated women would be less likely to turn to prostitution. They had over 20,000 members by 1938. Foreign anarchists found organizations like Mujeres Libres baffling, as discussions around women's rights by Spanish anarchist women were often based around expanding rights while at the same time maintaining traditional gender roles. Older members were often critical of younger ones, viewing them as being too hesitant to act and considering them obsessed with sexuality, birth control and access to abortions.  Slanders and propaganda  Women involved on the Republican side of the Civil War were defamed as a matter of course by nationalists, accused of spreading venereal disease, of being immoral and unnatural. Young women who displayed overt femininity on the Nationalist side during the war were also slandered over their sexuality, and accused of being traitors to the state for flirting with men. Women associated with Mujeres Libres were at times dismissed as prostitutes for their challenge of traditional gender roles. Women who found themselves in prison would often accuse other women of being prostitutes to try to imply their state was better than theirs. This was because for women in Nationalist prisons, there was no way for these women to differentiate themselves as political prisoners whom they were often housed alongside. Military and political leaders slandered milicianas, accusing them of being prostitutes and nymphomaniacs, representing a greater threat to the Republic than the fascist forces they were facing in battle because they spread venereal disease.Mika Etcheb√©rh√®re in Ma guerre d'Espagne √† moi published in Paris in 1976 contends that some women were straight up prostitutes, encouraged to the front by the presence of single men who had money.Mar√≠a de la Luz Mejias Correa in Asi fue pasando el tiemp: memor√≠as de una miliciana extreme√±a published in 2006 in Seville said that despite going to the front to accompany her husband, local women in the area still called her (incorrectly) a prostitute and a slut. These local women also accused milicianas of spreading venereal disease. While there were some brothels near the front, they were not run by milicianas and de la Luz Mejias Correa contends that men who went to brothels were never accused of spreading venereal disease. Clara Campoamor would be among a number of voices urging women off the front, accusing women of being prostitutes. When this was shared among milicianas, it made some of their blood boil, as it demonstrated to them that the left was no better than the right when it came to protecting women's rights. Such rationales, along with lack of weapons training, were used to make an argument that women should be removed from the front. Rosario S√°nchez Mora, La Dinamitera, reacted in anger when interviewed, saying that comparisons to prostitutes hurt her as these women were ready to die for their ideals and ready to die for those who shared in their leftist ideology. Milicianas often created and shared narratives that highlighted their chastity during the Civil War. When interviewed by the press, many women were offended by questions about their private lives. Nationalist propaganda in contract often depicted the miliciana as a prostitute. In the end, milicianas featured in propaganda published by both sides during the Civil War often served as a symbol of a gendered cultural ideal. Their depictions were often for the male gaze on both sides of the propaganda war. The way there were often drawn as highly sexualized beings made it easy for those on both sides to dismiss them as prostitutes.  Nationalist military  Salamanca and Burgos became home to large numbers of women who were wives of military officers on the Nationalist side. They could largely live comfortable, as their part of Spain was not in a state of total war. Both cities had zones for homes, and military zones. The military zones were home to medical services and to prostitutes. Nationalist nurses working in these zones were viewed as essential but transgressive, as they were occupying male spaces. As such, their behavior was always highly watched. Poverty and economic need often pushed many women into prostitution, where it flourished behind Nationalist lines. That Nationalist forces were fighting for a Spain that supported traditional family structures and opposed to prostitution did nothing to stop Nationalist officers from using prostitutes. These brothels would often involve binge drinking on the part of officers and physical violence enacted upon the bodies of the women they bought.  Francoist Spain (1938‚Äì1973)  Prostitution and how to combat it was a problem for the Franco regime given its historical acceptance and Catholic views opposing it. A zealous system of monitoring public morality was created to combat it. Lesbians in Francoist prisons were charged with prostitution instead of homosexuality, which makes it impossible to determine their numbers when compared to gay men.Conxita MIR CURC√ì, Pobreza, Marginaci√≥n, delincuencia y pol√≠ticas sociales bajo el franquismo.

As well as raised bog there are areas of saltmarsh, brackish grassland, alder carr, fen and woodland, and the variety of habitats at Moine Mh√≤r provide important habitats for a variety of animal and plant species. The area was declared a national nature reserve (NNR) in 1987, and is now owned and managed by NatureScot. According to NatureScot lowland raised bogs like Moine Mh√≤r are some of the rarest and most threatened natural wildlife habitats in Europe, due to removal of peat, afforestation and reclamation of farmland.The Story of Moine Mhor National Nature Reserve. p. 5. Around 8,000 people visit the Moine Mh√≤r NNR every year, with the reserve being popular with local people and school groups, as well as tourists visiting the nearby attractions of Kilmartin Glen and the Crinan Canal. A 600 m nature trail has been constructed at the northern edge of the reserve; other visitor facilities include a car park and picnic area. History The Moine Mh√≤r began to form after the last Ice Age some 10,000 years ago, as rising sea levels covered the area in impermeable marine clay. The land began to rise as the glaciers melted due to post-glacial rebound, and a shallow estuary formed at the mouth of the River Add. A freshwater loch formed over the Moine Mh√≤r, separated from the sea by an area of saltmarsh. About 5,500 years ago sea levels fell further, and sphagnum mosses started to colonise the area, which was kept damp due to the impermeable clay. Over time layers of peat were laid down, leading to the Moine Mh√≤r as it is today. Moine Mh√≤r lies to the west of Kilmartin Glen, one of the most important prehistoric landscapes in Scotland, however the boggy conditions prevented these prehistoric people from living or farming on the moss. It is nonetheless likely that they would have used the bog to cut peat for fuel, and to collect berries and lichens for food, drinks, dyes, and potions. Core samples have shown that the bog was regularly burnt to maintain open grazing for animals.The Story of Moine Mh√≤r National Nature Reserve. p. 12. The Crinan Canal, built immediately to the south of the Moine Mh√≤r between 1794 and 1801, led to a decline in peat cutting, as coal from the Glasgow area began to replace peat as fuel. Landowners began to \\"reclaim\\" the bog by drainage in order to commence agriculture. Controlled burning of the unimproved sections of the bog continued, however the focus shifted from grazing to sporting interests, with the aim of encouraging red grouse for shooting parties. Around 1980 approximately 100 ha of conifer plantation were planted at Moine Mhor. In order to prevent the disappearance of more of the blanket bog, the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC - the predecessor body of NatureScot) decided to purchase 500 ha of land and declared the area a national nature reserve.The Story of Moine Mh√≤r National Nature Reserve. p. 13. Since taking ownership NatureScot have attempted to reverse historical drainage of the bog by the damming of drainage ditches, with over 190 dams having been constructed by 2017. This has led to a rise in the water table, and allowed the sphagnum mosses to regenerate. NatureScot has also taken action to remove trees and scrubs in order to maintain the area as a raised bog. Flora and fauna Sphagnum mosses are the key plants in the formation of a raised bog and nine species have been recorded at Moine Mh√≤r NNR. The marginal habitats mean that there is also a diverse flowering plant community, including purple heath orchid, round-leaved sundew, bog myrtle and bog asphodel.The Story of Moine Mh√≤r National Nature Reserve. p. 8 The plant life of the bog helps supports many types of invertebrates, including the marsh fritillary (one of Europe‚Äôs most threatened butterfly species), which lives on devil's-bit scabious, a plant of the drier fringes of the bog. The large heath butterfly, a UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species is also present, and the reserve hosts many species of dragonflies.The Story of Moine Mh√≤r National Nature Reserve. p. 9. 235 bird species have been recorded at the reserve, with the bog itself supporting species such as curlew and meadow pipit, whilst redshank, snipe and oystercatcher breed on the saltmarsh areas. The reserve hosts an important population of breeding hen harriers; other raptors present include short-eared owls, which also breed here occasionally, whilst ospreys can be seen fishing along the river and at the estuary.The Story of Moine Mh√≤r National Nature Reserve. p. 10.

It was opened in 1902 by Frederick Samuel Willoughby, vicar of Hooton Pagnell. In 1904 a sister institution, St Chad's Hall, was opened at the University of Durham. The hostel closed in 1916, when its buildings were requisitioned as a war hospital. All teaching moved to Durham, where the hostel's sister institution survives as St Chad's College, Durham.  History  Foundation  Beam dated 1903 at the main entrance of the hostel building In 1902 the vicar of Hooton Pagnell, Revd Frederick Samuel Willoughby, opened St Chad's Hostel in the village to prepare men of limited means to enter theological college. In the first issue of the hostel's magazine, Willoughby wrote: The hostel received extensive financial support from Julia Warde-Aldam, owner of Hooton Pagnell Hall. Initially students were housed in the vicarage, then, as numbers grew, in surrounding farms. The 1903 college magazine records the hostel having 42 students, resident in seven houses - Scott's, Pashley's, Smith's, Seels', Roper's, Harrison's and Vicarage. In 1903, Julia Warde-Aldam funded the construction of a dedicated building, in the centre of Hooton Pagnell, with room for twenty students and a large lecture room. This building opened in the summer of 1904. In its early years, the hostel had a connection with Willoughby's alma mater, Lichfield Theological College. The Principal of the college, Prebendary E. Elmer Harding, visited the college in 1903 and was described in the college magazine as \\"our Educational Sponsor before all and sundry\\". The hostel used as its arms those of the Diocese of Lichfield (the cross potent quadrate of St Chad, surrounded by four crosslets patee) with the hostel's own motto, \\"Non Vestra Sed Vos\\".  Expansion to Durham  The original home of St Chad's Hall on South Bailey in Durham In 1903, the Revd Stephen Moulsdale, a recent graduate from Hatfield Hall at the University of Durham, was appointed vice-principal of the hostel, along with Revd Harold Merryweather who also held a Durham MA. Shortly afterwards, with financial assistance from Douglas Horsfall, a wealthy Liverpool businessman and devoted churchman, St Chad's Hall was established in Durham as a sister institution to the hostel, with Moulsdale as its first principal. The hall was licensed by the Durham University Senate as the first independent hall of the University, and opened in October 1904 with nineteen matriculated students. At around the same time, Willoughby resigned as principal, and Moulsdale became principal of the hostel as well as the hall. Willoughby's departure was apparently on bad terms; he forbade the new vice- principal of the hostel, Revd Sydney Richards, from celebrating mass in the parish church, and the hostel's 1905 St Chad's Day celebrations took place at the church in Hickleton instead. After Willoughby's departure in 1906, cordial relations between the church and hostel were restored, with new vicar A H Kearney appointed honorary chaplain at the hostel.  Kensit Crusade  In February 1911, the Anglo-Catholic orientation of the hostel brought protestors to Hooton Pagnell, when a large number of participants in the \\"Kensit Crusade\\", a movement against ritualism in the Church of England, marched from South Elmsall to Hooton Pagnell to protest what they saw as young men being trained to become Roman Catholic priests in the Church of England, as well as against the ritualistic practices of various local clergy.  Closure  The hostel continued to operate as a preliminary place of study, preparing students to qualify for university matriculation at Durham, until 1916 when it was requisitioned as a hospital during the First World War and all teaching was concentrated in Durham. The hostel briefly re-opened after the war, but the financial problems of running the hall across two sites led to it closing permanently in 1921. With the removal of the theological college to Durham, the Hostel was bequeathed to the village by the Warde-Aldam family as a village club. It now operates as a pub, \\"The Hostel\\". The hall in Durham was renamed St Chad's College in 1918, and continues to operate as an independent college of the University of Durham.

The film is about soccer, feminism, and the revolution that toppled Muammar Gadaffi's rule in 2011.  Background  Arebi's father is Libyan, and she grew up in the United Kingdom. Until the 2011 revolution, she had never been to her father's native land, but found herself fascinated with the sweeping changes overtaking the nation following the Arab Spring, and decided to fill in this gap in her personal history. The film, Freedom Fields, is the result of her personal and documentary investigation.  Contents  The film follows three friends, Naama, Halima and Fadwa, who met on the soccer field. Their stories are told in three parts: The first occurs in 2012, a year after the revolution - a period of great hope for change, democracy and gender equality. The second part takes place in 2014, when the spirit of hope has evaporated, and is replaced with a sense of confusion and loss, after ISIS establishes their presence in Libya. The last part is in 2016, and describes the great sadness of the Libyan people as they realize the revolution was a complete failure, and if anything, they are worse off. And yet, not everyone has lost all hope, and some are still committed to the struggle for change. The film opens with a quote from Audre Lorde's canonical feminist book from 1984, Sister Outsider:  Part 1  Upon Arebi's arrival in 2011, the Libyan revolution is at its height. She begins to document the key role played by women in leading the first protests, smuggling arms, supporting the rebels at the front; and afterwards, when they were elected to central roles in the national elections. Arebi also recorded the optimism that accompanied the unfolding events. In the course of this work, while in England, she first hears of the Libyan women's football team on an Internet message board. She asks to meet the team when she returns to Libya. She discovers that the team has existed for 10 years, and includes more than 30 women and girls, but they have never been allowed to play a match. It is only in 2012 that the Libyan Football Association permits the team to compete for the first time, in a tournament against other Arab women's teams in Germany. The permission to play is the result of a years-long struggle, and the women view this victory as the fulfillment of the promise of the revolution, that things are changing for women in Libya. Arebi talks about this time, calling it, in hindsight, \\"naivete\\", but of a sort that infected every aspect of life and creativity, from literature, to poetry, to film-making, and that a great number of collaborations were begun at this time.  Part 2  Soon, however, it becomes clear that there is strong opposition in addition to the optimism and desire for change. For the women's team, this means that some men are beginning to voice objections to the women playing in shorts, and that if this is what change looks like - then change is not desired. The opposition swells, especially online. Arebi documents both the opposition to the team and the women's responses, which are far from simple: The players want to play the game they love, and they also want to respect their religion and society, and are unsure how to balance these conflicting attitudes. In the end, the team receives the news that they will not be permitted to play.  Part 3  Two years later, the women's football team has disbanded. while the Libyan civil war has escalated. Naama, Halima and Fadwa - each in her own way - is trying to understand what happened, and to find a way to express her love of the game. \\"Together, we had hope, together we lost hope, and together we also renewed our hope\\", says Arebi. In spite of the two year jumps in the flow of the film, Arebi continued to film and document in the gaps not covered in Freedom Fields, and is planning on showcasing her work in a second documentary, which she calls \\"even more tragic\\", called After the Revolution.  Release  The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2018, and was selected to screen at the British Film Institute in October 2018, and continued from there to additional international festivals. Freedom Fields was nominated for the Bronze Horse award at the Stockholm International Film Festival.

Its leaves are in a ground rosette, and have a stalk of mostly long and an inverted egg-shaped to elliptic, 6‚Äì9 cm (2.6‚Äì4.6 in) long and wide leaf blade, with a toothed margin. It mostly has two flower heads at the tip of the branches of each erect, dark reddish brown scape. The flower heads have a bell- to cup-shaped involucre that consists of 20‚Äì24, purplish, overlapping bracts in 3‚Äì4 whorls. These protect 12‚Äì16 pink, ray florets, surrounding many yellow disc florets. This species was only seen flowering once, in December. It is known from one location in the Langeberg, Western Cape province of South Africa.  Taxonomy  This species of fire daisy was first recognised by Ulrike Zinnecker-Wiegand in 2011. She named it Mairia petiolata, based on a specimen collected by South African botanist Elsie Elizabeth Esterhuysen at Misty Point on Goedgeloof Peak, in the Swellendam District, Western Cape province of South Africa in 1979.  Description Mairia petiolata is a perennial herbaceous plant of up to high. It has dark brown to black, thick and succulent roots of up to long and about 2 mm (0.08 in) thick. The approximately six to ten leaves are in a ground rosette, and have a stalk of mostly long (full range 1‚Äì9 cm). They are slender, often washed dark purple-red, always densely set with white woolly hairs on the inner axils, and the remainder of the surface white woolly, eventually or even very young hairless. The leaf blade is inverted egg-shaped to elliptic, 6‚Äì9 cm (2.6‚Äì4.6 in) long and wide. The tip is mostly sharply, rarely bluntly pointy, the base tapering gradually to a point (or attenuate), the margin with coarse and irregular teeth, perhaps somewhat lobed, seldomly almost entire, rolled down. On the underside a netted structure of veins is visible but on the upper surface, only a single main vein can be distinguished. The leaves are often coloured dark red, both surfaces may be hairless or set with few or many short woolly hairs, but the leaf surfaces are always visible through the indumentum. From each rosette, usually one to three rigid, erect, dark reddish brown, ribbed, occasionally loosely woolly, sparsely glandular and slightly broadened flower stalks of long emerge, with one to three bracts that are increasingly smaller further up, which branch about halfway, are white woolly just below the mostly two, rarely one or three flower heads. The bracts that jointly surround the florets in the same head form a broadly bell-shaped to cup-shaped involucre of about hig and 1‚Äì1 cm in diameter. There are between twenty and twenty four overlapping bracts arranged in three to four whorls, occasionally with white woolly hairs and some glands on the surface, each of which is tinged dark red-violet or purplish but green in the middle, narrowly oval to narrowly inverted egg-shaped, with papery margins set with a dense, regular row of equally long hairs. The bracts in the outermost whorl are 5‚Äì7 mm (0.22‚Äì0.28 in) long and wide. The bracts in the inner whorl are long and wide, eventually hairless. Each flower head contains twelve to sixteen pink, functionally female ray florets, with a closed tube at the base of about long set with some glandular hairs, and with a line-shaped strap that radiates out from the head of long, bluntly ending in three lobes, narrower towards the base, and with five to seven veins. From the mouth of the ray floret tubes extends a tube consisting of five infertile staminodes, through which a forked style grows. The ray florets surround many bisexual disc florets with a yellow corolla of about long, which is only slightly longer than the pappus. The tube nearer the base is glandular hairy in its lower half, the five lobes at the top are distinctly upright, loosely glandular hairy and have resin ducts along their margins. Sticking out of the center of each disc floret corolla are five anthers of 1 mm (0.06 in) long with triangular appendages at their tips, that are merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. The styles are dark red and exert far beyond the mouth of the florets. At the tip of both style branches of long is a triangular appendage of about long and wide. Surrounding the base of the corolla of both ray- and disc florets are two whorls of pappus. The outer whorl consists of few white, free, delicate, barbed bristles of long. The inner whorl consists of more white feathery bristles of up to long, barbed near the base. The eventually bright brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are inverted egg- shaped, about long and wide, with four or five ribs along their lengths, with shiny glands and many, long twin hairs on a further smooth seed skin.  Differences with other Mairia species  Mairia petiolata has leaves with particularly coarse and irregular teeth along the margin, a distinct pattern of netted veins on the underside, and slender leaf stalks. It also has relatively graceful and elegant flower heads at the top of long, slender, mostly branched stalks. The involucral bracts have dark red margins, the disc florets are longer than the pappus and the dark red styles extend far beyond the mouth of the florets.  Distribution and conservation  Mairia petiolata is known from only one location in the Langeberg, just to the north of Swellendam. Here it grows among a fynbos vegetation on sandstone slopes above . It is considered critically rare because this one population is stable and does not seem to be under thread.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. History When the land around Grass Lake was opened up to European settlers in the 1830s, the plot where this building now stands was bought and sold multiple times. Finally, in 1837, the parcel was sold to Daniel Walker, one of the area's first European inhabitants and the founder of Grass Lake village. Walker owned the land until his death in 1839, at which time it passed to his widow Maria. When Maria died in 1846, a parcel was split off for her son, William H. Walker, who was a local brick manufacturer and eventually established a drug business. In 1869, Walker's daughter Aurora married cabinet-maker and undertaker Henry Vinkle Jr., and in 1871 The Walkers gave Aurora and Henry a small plot of land next door to their house. Likely between about 1871 and 1875, the Vinkles constructed a house on the plot of land. They lived and raised two children in the house. Henry Vinkle's business flourished, and he branched out into other investments and served some time in public office. In the late 1890s. however, the family moved to the Dakota Territory for health reasons, eventually settling in Dickey County, North Dakota. In 1901, the Vinkles sold the house was sold to the Detroit, Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor and Jackson Railway, who used it as a boarding house for their workers. In 1909, the railway sold the house to the elderly Herman H. and Fredericka Mellencamp. Herman died in 1919 and Fredericka in 1920, leaving the house to their son Henry. In 1925, Henry Mellencamp rented it to the young widow, Cathrene Walz, who purchased the home the next year. Walz remained in the house many years, renting rooms and raising her family, She eventually sold it to Archie and Myrta Coe. The Coes lived in the house until Archie's death in 1969 and Myrta left to live with her children in 1974. Myrta Coe arranged to have the Grass Lake Area Historical Society purchase the home, to turn into a museum. The Coe House Museum opened to the public in 1977.

Early life and education  Mothersole was born in Essex in 1874 and trained at the Slade School of Fine Art in London from 1891/92 until 1896. During this time Mothersole was awarded prizes and certificates in drawing from life and antique drawing. From 1899 Mothersole studied with and then worked with the artist Henry Holiday as his studio assistant and was closely associated with him and his family until his death in 1927. Holiday wrote enthusiastically in his memoirs about Mothersole's talent with stained glass and decorative arts and intended to bequeath her his collections of cartoons and drawings. While at the Slade School of Fine Arts, Mothersole was also taught by Alphonse Legros and by her own account in 1892 when she went to speak to him found a discarded self-portrait which had been torn into eight pieces. Mothersole kept the pieces and later donated the drawing to the Victoria and Albert Museum. Mothersole also donated a silverpoint drawing of a young woman by Ellen Lucy Grazebrook. Career Mothersole's early work in archaeological drawing included drawings of wall paintings from Saqqara, exhibited by Flinders Petrie in an exhibition at University College London in 1904. These followed her work at the 1903/4 excavation season at Saqqara with Margaret Murray where alongside drawings Mothersole recorded the season with photographs, some of which were later published in an article \\"Tomb Copying in Egypt\\" for the family magazine Sunday at Home. A photograph credited to Mothersole from this period was taken at Luxor and is now in the Petrie Museum. Mothersole put on a further exhibition of her Egyptian work at Walker's Art Gallery, New Bond Street, London of Sketches in Egypt and other Works with Henry Holiday from 16 to 28 March 1908. Following her early work in Egypt, Mothersole primarily focused on British archaeology. Mothersole's first illustrated book, concerning the Isles of Scilly, was published in 1910, and her first full-length book on Hadrian's Wall in 1922. Mothersole's key watercolours of Hadrian's Wall were exhibited 30 October-11 November 1922 at Walker's Art Gallery. Mothersole, like Henry Holiday, was an active campaigner for Women's suffrage. She made a drawing of a fellow campaigner, Myra Sadd Brown, at a meeting in c.1912 which is held in the archives of the Women's Library. Select publications *1903. (Illustrator) Apuleius.

Private life  Kay was an only child, and was born in 4 Grindlay Street, Edinburgh, where she lived most of her life. She was a pupil at the James Gillespie's School for Girls from the age of 5 where she later taught. At the age of 15, her father, Alexander Kay, a cabinet maker, died. She continued to live with her mother and cared for her until her death in 1913. Kay was a devout Christian and remained unmarried. She is buried in Abercorn Cemetery, West Lothian, which was her wish.  Career  Kay completed her teacher training between 1897 and 1899 at the Church of Scotland College, Edinburgh. She was described as an 'exemplary' student. She taught at the James Gillespie's School for Girls and was an inspirational teacher to her 11- to 12-year old students. At the time Kay commenced her career as a school teacher, few women could take degrees, and therefore Kay remained 'class mistress' without getting promotion. Kay retired in 1942.  Kay as inspiration for Miss Jean Brodie  One of Kay's pupils was Muriel Camberg, later Spark, whose literary success Kay predicted. Spark later wrote The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and the main character, Jean Brodie, a stern schoolmistress, was based on Christina Kay. Kay, like Miss Jean Brodie, would speak to her pupils about her travels to Italy, and was an admirer of Mussolini. She had a picture of the Fascisti on her classroom wall. Kay called her class the 'cr√©me de la cr√©me' and would form friendships with individual pupils, among those Muriel Camberg and her friend Frances Niven, whom she would take on private outings. Kay's pupils believed that she lost a fianc√© in the first World War, a rumour unconfirmed by her. In The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Miss Brodie also had a fianc√© she lost in the war.

She was a lifelong friend of the prison reformer Margery Fry, Labour Councillor for Hampstead in London, and undertook significant relief work before, during and after the Second World War. Some time after graduating with an arts degree from the University of Birmingham, Marjorie worked as a lecturer in education at the University of Sheffield for several years. She was appointed warden of Masson Hall, University of Edinburgh, in 1924 and General Advisor to Women Students at the University in 1927.  Early life  Marjorie was born in Highgate, Middlesex on 24 June 1888 to Matthew and Fanny Rackstraw (n√©e Blofeld), the second out of five children. Her father was a tradesman who owned two shops on Upper Street, Islington, and her mother's family were dealers in Smithfield. The family lived in a large house in Cholmondeley Park until their children left home. As a young girl, Marjorie attended Grove School, Highgate, but transferred to a school for disabled children at Margate after developing spinal problems, possibly resulting from polio. She continued to suffer from spinal troubles throughout her life.  Education  After a year in France, Marjorie went on to study for an undifferentiated arts degree at the University of Birmingham. It was during her time at Birmingham that she met Margery Fry, who was then warden of University House. After her time at Birmingham she spent a year at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania.  Career  Marjorie eventually returned to Birmingham to assist Margery Fry at University House. When the older Margery left to work with the Friends' War Victims Relief Committee, Marjorie followed in her footsteps and began working with refugees on the Marne. In 1920, Marjorie's relief work took her to Russia, where she worked through the famine. In her autobiography, Unfinished Adventure: Selected Reminiscences from an Englishwoman's Life (1933), suffragist Evelyn Sharp describes Marjorie as fluent in Russian, efficient, and possessing \\"the sympathetic temperament of a leader\\" which led her to being \\"very popular with the members of the village Soviet and with all the Russians she had to deal with in her district.\\" After working as a lecturer in education at the University of Sheffield, Marjorie served as the warden of Masson Hall at the University of Edinburgh from 1924 to 1937. In 1927, she was also appointed General Advisor to Women Students at the University. In this capacity, she was personally responsible for interviewing the vast majority of women students not residing in halls or recognised hostels. Upon her resignation from the post, Marjorie left a detailed guide for her successor, in which she noted: > \\"The chief duties of the Adviser of Women Students are to give advice on > careers, on general matters, and, where necessary, on accommodation.... She > is concerned with the social life of the students generally and is > responsible for keeping a Register of Lodgings which is reviewed every year. > She is a member of the Appointments Board and of the Athletic Committee. She > has an office in the Old College and the assistance of a part-time > secretary.\\" In 1937, Marjorie entered into lengthy correspondence with Scottish suffragist Frances Melville, hoping to compile data from all the Scottish universities in order to advocate for women's potential in governmental service. In response to concerns that \\"some parts of the world would be unsuitable for women to live in,\\" Marjorie sought to gather information from female graduates with overseas experience about whether they had encountered difficulties because of their gender.

She gained notoriety for being at the centre of allegations of prostitution and 'disturbance of the peace' in a case brought to the courts in Edinburgh.  Life  Burns was one of three daughters from her father's first marriage; after her father's second marriage Burns moved from Durham to Edinburgh. Burns arrived in Edinburgh in 1789 when she was approximately 20 years old and took up residence with Sally Sanderson at an address on Rose Street. Burns was noted as being very beautiful and fashionable; gaining attention at the 'evening promenades'. An engraving by John Kay depicted her wearing the fashion of the time. She was involved in a number of disturbances reported around her Rose Street address in Edinburgh. William Creech, a bookseller, publisher and local magistrate, then assisted her neighbours in bringing these complaints to the courts. The complaint was \\"since Whitsunday last, she and a Miss Sally Sanderson, who were persons of bad character, had kept a very irregular and disorderly house, into which they admit and entertain licentious and profligate persons of both sexes to the great annoyance of their neighbours and breach of the public peace...\\". These disturbances lead to her being brought before the magistrates where she was sentenced to banishment from the city with the charge of being 'drummed through the streets' and 'confinement in the house of corrections for 6 months' if she returned to Edinburgh. The verdict was over-turned after an appeal to the courts that received a statement from one of the original witnesses claimed to have been induced to give a statement against Burns. The poet Robert Burns, who was unrelated to Margaret Burns, followed the case closely and wrote the following under an image of her in his published works; > 'Cease ye prudes your envious railing Lovely burns has charms - confess. > True it is she had one failing Had a woman ever less?' Burns remained in Edinburgh after the verdict was overturned but eventually moved to Roslin, Midlothian, less than 10 miles from her Rose Street address. She died shortly after this at the age of 22. Burns was buried in a graveyard in Rosslyn Chapel.

Until 1983, she was a reporter for the Nouvel Observateur working in the Middle East. She then turned to literature, publishing the international best-seller De la part de la princesse morte (Regards from the Dead Princess) in 1987 which told the story of her family. Les jardins de Badalpour, further documenting her family history, followed in 1998. Biography Born in Paris in November 1939, Keniz√© Hussain de Kotwara is the daughter of Princess Selma Raouf, who was the grand-daughter of Murad V, a sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Her father was the Indian Raja of Badalpur. After her mother died in poverty when she was only a year and a half old, she was brought up in a Catholic environment by a French family. Keniz√© chose to use the name Mourad in honour of her great grandfather who spent 30 years in prison and had no life. In 1970, on graduating in sociology and psychology from the Sorbonne, she became a reporter for Le Nouvel Observateur in the Middle East, covering the Iranian revolution and the war in Lebanon. After working as a journalist for 12 years, she decided to turn to literature, upset by the censorship she experienced. \\"My work was never openly rejected,\\" she explains, \\"but instead I would be told 'The article is too long' or the story would be delayed constantly until I gave up.\\" From 1983, she conducted four years of detailed research in Turkey, Lebanon and India as a basis for her novel De la part de la princesse morte which was published in 1987.

Macie \\"Bobby\\" Roberts was the original supervisor of the human computers at NASA, later dubbed the rocket women. She believed that it would be too difficult to work with men, so she created a culture of all women that spanned much longer than her time at JPL. Roberts's job was not limited to just calculations, she hired and trained the new employees for over thirty years after being promoted. Her successor, Helen Ling, continued on the tradition of only hiring women. The women on Robert's team performed trajectory calculations for all space flights before the advent of the desktop computer. One of the techniques that Roberts employed to find women for the job was to list the job as \\"not requiring a degree.\\" This was code meant for women to know that the job was open to all women.  Legacy  Her legacy was continued on by the supervisors that followed her. Many women that were just as smart as male engineers could not find work, but they were hired on to be rocket women at JPL.

In the early 19th century the old medieval building was replaced by a new church, begun in 1809 and completed in 1815.

It is also presented as Te (effective or equivalent). Effective elastic thickness of the oceanic lithosphere Te is largely dependent on the thermal structure of the lithosphere, its thickness and the coupling of crust with mantle. For the oceanic lithosphere with coupled crust and mantle, Te is usually taken to the base of the mechanical lithosphere (isotherm of 500 - 600 ¬∞C). This way it is also age dependent, as gradually thickens moving off the oceanic ridge. Effective elastic thickness of the continental lithosphere For the continental lithosphere more aspects are taken under consideration, thermal age is only the estimate for slowly cooling cratonic areas, where mantle is involved and Te reaches large values. Similar conditions are expected also on terrestrial planets. If the crust is decoupled from mantle, value follows the average crustal thickness. Topography load is also important factor, significantly lowering the value of Te. Methods of determination Methods for Te determination on continents are mostly based on thermal and rheological approach, but also on comparison of gravity anomalies and topography. For thermally young areas Te is about 20-30 km, for older 40-50 km, cratons can reach more than 100 km. Determination of the effective elastic thickness is important for Earth's surface deformation studies, warp tectonics, glacial isostatic rebound and sea-level changes.

She uses various formats to express herself ranging from text to scenic reading and performance (performing knowledge). Moreover, she combines academic and lyrical narrative. In 2012, she was guest professor for Gender studies and Postcolonial studies at the Humboldt University of Berlin.  Life  Grada Kilomba was born in Lisbon and is of West African descent (S√£o Tom√© e Pr√≠ncipe and Angola). In Lisbon, she studied clinical psychology and psychoanalysis at the Instituto de Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA). While practicing as a psychologist in Portugal, she worked in psychiatry with war-traumatised people from Angola and Mozambique and initiated various artistic and therapeutic projects on trauma and memory as well as on the work of Frantz Fanon. Grada Kilomba received a scholarship from the Heinrich B√∂ll Foundation to pursue her PhD, which she completed in 2008 at the Free University of Berlin where she additionally worked as a guest lecturer. From 2009 to 2010, she was a fellow at the Berlin Institute for Cultural Inquiry. In subsequent years, she taught post-colonial studies, psychoanalysis, and the work of Frantz Fanon at various universities, including the Free University of Berlin, the University of Bielefeld, and the University of Ghana in Accra. Most recently, she was Professor of Gender Studies and Postcolonial Studies at the Humboldt University in Berlin. There she conducted research on African diasporas, among other topics, and taught on Decolonial Feminism, Decolonizing Knowledge, and Performing Knowledge. She gives lectures in Europe. In the talk show \\"Insight Germany\\", presented by Deutsche Welle in 2013, Kilomba talked about how early experiences of racism in post-fascist Portugal in the 1970s and 1980s shaped their perception of the world. In 2009, German Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung commented: \\"Her literary work combines post-colonial discourse and lyrical prose on the traces of slavery, colonialism and everyday racism\\".  Work  Kilomba says about her work: \\"My goal is to always appropriate the spaces with new knowledge configurations. It is a political work, parallel to my artistic work. The intention is to decolonize the discourse.\\" In 2008, she became known to a wider audience through her book Plantation Memories (2008), a collection of everyday experiences of racism in the form of psychoanalytic short stories, first published for the International Literature Festival at the Haus der Berliner Festspiele. The short stories concern racism related to voice and the right to speak, hair politics, space, gender, trauma, skin politics and sexual politics. In this book, she asks, for instance: > \\"What knowledge is being acknowledged as such? And what knowledge is not? > What knowledge has been made part of academic agendas? And what knowledge > has not? Whose knowledge is this? Who is acknowledged to have the knowledge? > And who is not? Who can teach knowledge? And who cannot? Who is at the > centre? And who remains outside, at the margins?\\" In 2013, Plantation Memories by Kilomba was adapted for a stage reading at the Ballhaus Naunynstra√üe theatre in Berlin. The theatre wrote about her work: \\"With her book, Plantation Memories ‚Äì Episodes of Everyday Racism, Grada Kilomba succeeds in revealing the consequences of racist violence and racist traumata through her concise and profound language.\\" One year later, the scenic reading was shown at the Haus der Berliner Festspiele. \\"In her performances, Grada Kilomba brings the oral African tradition to a contemporary context, using texts, narration, images and video projections to recover the memories and realities of a postcolonial world.\\" In recent works, Kilomba has increasingly been concerned with the performative staging of theoretical and political texts, including the film Conakry (2013) about the African freedom fighter Am√≠lcar Cabral. The short film is a project by Grada Kilomba, director Filipa C√©sar and radio editor and activist Diana McCarty. Conakry was realized at the House of World Cultures in Berlin and shown at Art Tatler International, Theater Arsenal in Berlin and Funda√ß√£o Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon, among others. In the aforementioned interview with Deutsche Welle, Kilomba states the following with regard to contemporary racism: > \\"We have to start posing other questions. So, it is not the question 'Am I > racist or not?' but much more the question 'How do I dismantle my own > racisms?' So, it is also not a moral question. It is really a question of > responsibility. Racism is not about guilt and shame and denial. It is about > taking responsibility.\\" Grada Kilomba in \\"Kosmos\\", at Gorki Theater (2016) Since 2015, Grada Kilomba has been developing the project \\"Decolonizing Knowledge: Performing Knowledge\\". Kampnagel writes about her lecture performance \\"Decolonizing Knowledge\\": \\"In her lecture performance, Grada Kilomba uncovers the violence of classical knowledge production and asks: What is recognized as knowledge? Whose knowledge is this? Who is allowed to produce knowledge at all? Kilomba touches this colonial wound by opening up a hybrid space in which the boundaries between academic and artistic language blur and the structures of knowledge and power transform.\\" Decolonizing Knowledge was shown at the University of Amsterdam, the University of Link√∂ping (Sweden) and the Vienna Secession, among others. The project is accompanied by experimental videos such as While I Write (2015), in which Grada Kilomba explores the function of writing for postcolonial subjects. While I Write was premiered at the Vienna Secession in 2015. \\"Kilomba gives us a glimpse into our narcissistic society, which offers up little by way of symbols, images and vocabularies with which to deal with the present.\\"  Publications  * Plantation Memories.

It is a production-ready framework that allows developers to quickly create static and dynamic JAMstack websites and is used widely by many large companies. Next.js is one of several recommended \\"toolchains\\" available when starting a new React app, all of which provide a layer of abstraction to aid in common tasks. Traditional React apps render all their content in the client-side browser, Next.js is used to extend this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side. The copyright and trademarks for Next.js are owned by Vercel. On July 27, 2020 Next.js version 9.5 was announced, adding new capabilities including incremental static regeneration, rewrites, and redirect support.  Background  Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. React is a web framework that is traditionally used to build web applications rendered in the client's browser with Javascript. Developers recognize several problems with this strategy however, such as not catering to users who do not have access to javascript or have disabled it, potential security issues, significantly extended page loading times, and it can harm the site's overall search engine optimization. Frameworks such as Next.js sidestep these problems by allowing some or all of the website to be rendered on the server-side before being sent to the client. Next.js is one of the most popular components available in React. It is one of several recommended \\"toolchains\\" available when starting a new app, all of which provide a layer of abstraction to aid in common tasks. Next.js requires Node.js and can be initialized using Node Package Manager. Google has donated to the Next.js project, contributing 43 pull requests in 2019 where they helped in pruning unused JavaScript, reducing overhead time, and adding improved metrics. As of March 2020, the framework is used by many large websites, including Netflix, Docker, GitHub, Uber, and Starbucks. In early 2020, it was announced that Vercel had secured twenty-one million dollars in Series A funding to support improvements to the software.  Development history  Next.js was first released as an open-source project on GitHub on . It was originally developed based on six principles: out-of-the box functionality requiring no setup, JavaScript everywhere, all functions are written in JavaScript, automatic code-splitting and server-rendering, configurable data-fetching, anticipating requests, and simplifying deployment. Next.js 2.0 was announced in March 2017 including several improvements that made it easier to work with small websites. It also increased the build efficiency and improved the scalability of the hot-module replacement feature. Version 7.0 was released in September of 2018 with improved error handling and support for React's context API for improved dynamic route handling. This was also the first version to upgrade to webpack 4. Version 8.0 was released in February 2019 and was the first version to offer serverless deployment of applications, in which the code is split up into lambda functions that are ran on demand. The version also reduced the time and resources required for static exports and imporved prefetch performance. Version 9.3, announced in March 2020, included various optimizations and global Sass and CSS module support. On July 27, 2020 Next.js version 9.5 was announced, adding new capabilities including incremental static regeneration, rewrites, and redirect support. The framework's original author, Guillermo Rauch, is currently the CEO of Vercel and the projects lead developer is Tim Neutkens.  Styling and features  The Next.js framework utilizes JAMstack architecture, which distinguishes between front-end and back-end and allows for efficient front-end development that is independent of any back-end APIs. The framework supports common CSS as well as precompiled Scss and Sass, CSS-in-JS, and styled JSX. In addition, it is built with TypeScript support and smart bundling. The framework integrates with Redux for state management and uses the GraphQLquery language for API calls. The software uses Redux's \\"store\\" to hold information about the state of the application, which is updated sequentially to avoid read-write conflicts. The open source transpiler Babel is used to transform and compile code into JavaScript usable by a browser. Webpack, another open-source tool, is used to bundle the modules afterwards. All of these tools are used with npm in a terminal. The main feature of Next.js is its use of server-side rendering to reduce the burden on web browsers and provide enhanced security. This can be done for any part of the application or the entire project, allowing for content-rich pages to be singled out for server-side rendering. It can also be done only for first time visitors, to reduce the burden on web browsers that have yet to download any of the site's assets. The \\"hot reloading\\" feature detects changes as they are made and re-renders the appropriate pages so they server avoids the need to be restarted. This allows changes made to the application code to be immediately reflected in the web browser, though some browsers will require the page to be refreshed. The software uses page-based routing for developer convenience and includes support for dynamic routing. Other features include hot-module replacement so that modules can be replaced live, automatic code splitting, which only includes code necessary to load the page, and page prefetching to reduce load time.

History  There are very few historical information about Rio San Martino, reflecting the poor relevance of the town. Probable the Roman origin, since the center of the village rises near the intersection between a cardo and a decumanus of the altinate centuriation. The place names of Gallese and Sermazza (today Capitellon) could refer to two barbaric settlements, respectively of Gauls and Sarmatian. Rio San Martino is mentioned in 1152 as a chapel dependent on the parish church of Zero. During the Republic of Venice, the villa of Rio San Martino was divided into five districts (Rio San Martin Galese, Rio San Martin di Sopra, Rio San Martin di Mezo, Rio San Martin Sarmazza, Rio San Martin Church).  Monuments and places of interest   Parish church  In ancient times was a chapel of the parish church of Zero, from 1560 it has its own rector. The current building was consecrated on 20 April 1512. Restored in 1761, it was significantly modified in 1958 with enlargement works. Inside is preserved the San Martino altarpiece and the poor attributed to Sante Peranda, while the ceiling fresco (Apotheosis of San Martino), and the one above the entrance (David playing the harp in front of Saul), were commissioned in 1811 to Giovanni Carlo Bevilacqua. Other works by the same author have been lost: the Madonna del Rosario canvas between San Vincenzo and San Domenico and the frescoes La Fede, Speranza and Carit√† and the Sacrifice of Abraham. The frescoes of the presbytery are by prof. Soligo (1950‚Äì1952). The organ, by Domenico Malvestio, built at the beginning of the twentieth century, comes from the archpriest church of Noale. The bell tower is from 1846 to 1856.

It was based around the Banggai Islands and the eastern coast of Sulawesi, centered at the island of Banggai. For a significant part of its history, the kingdom was under the overlordship of the Sultanate of Ternate. History Ternate The island of Banggai was named in a Chinese document dating from 1304 and the 14th century Negarakertagama as a Majapahit tributary. In the 16th century, four small states located in Banggai were conquered by the Sultanate of Ternate under Sultan Babullah, with Java-born Ternatean general Adi Cokro expanding the polity in the 1580s to include parts of mainland Sulawesi. Adi Cokro's son Mandapar was recorded to rule between 1600 and 1625. It was recorded that the king of Banggai sent his son to Ternate in 1564 to examine Christianity and Islam, eventually selecting the former. Between 1536 and 1539, Portuguese administrator Ant√≥nio Galv√£o recorded contemporary oral tales of the kings of Banggai, along with Bacan, Papua, and Butung, being descended from hatchlings of four serpent eggs found by an elder in Bacan. The myth associated the states with the Maluku Islands ‚Äì centered around Ternate and Tidore ‚Äì placing them in the peripheries. A Dutch report from 1682 noted the Banggai Kingdom as having control over the relatively large islands of Banggai and Peleng, \\"a hundred\\" little islands ‚Äì mostly uninhabited ‚Äì in addition to parts of Southeast Sulawesi such as Balantak. Inhabitants of Peleng were subjected to slavery. Banggai also had dependencies in the eastern parts of Sulawesi's East Peninsula. During this time, the island of Banggai was central to trade in foodstuffs in the area. Another Dutch figure from 1679 gave the kingdom's population as \\"10,000 able- bodied men\\", mostly non-Muslims. A later estimate from 1706 noted that some 90 percent of the population lived in Peleng ‚Äì the total population estimate being as high as 21,560. During this time, Banggai was located between the powerful states of Ternate and Gowa, though Banggai later came under influence of Ternate following the Treaty of Bongaya in 1667, with Ternate receiving annual tribute from Banggai and appointing its ruler. During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company attempted to spread its influence to Banggai with little success. During this time, Banggai was also subjected to raids from Papuans and routinely fought with the Tambuku and Buton polities. Dutch East Indies and Indonesia In 1907, Ternate ceded territories including Banggai to the Dutch East Indies, and the following year the king of Banggai signed a treaty with the Dutch putting the kingdom under Dutch control. Banggai's territories were administered through two Onderafdeling ‚Äì the islands and the mainland. After the independence of Indonesia, territories that comprised the Banggai kingdom was reorganized into the Central Sulawesi province, with an administrative reorganization in 1952 removing any legal powers of the kingdom. Today, the former territories of the kingdom are divided into the regencies of Banggai, Banggai Islands and Banggai Laut. Government Although the position is hereditary, the king of Banggai is ultimately appointed by the Sultan of Ternate, and acts as the polity's chief executive. The king is aided by four advisers, who also help in monitoring four autonomous local chiefs known as the basalo sangkap. As an example, the 1706 Dutch estimate noted that Banggai had a population of 1,450, with the king of Banggai only having 150 men and the rest under the 4 local chiefs.

The first examples were developed just before the opening of World War II and they have remained a major instrument on patrol aircraft since that time. It is part of the wider surface search radar classification, which includes similar radars in ground and ship mountings. The first ASV was developed after the accidental detection of wharves and cranes while testing an air-to-air radar in 1937. For a variety of reasons, ASV was easier to develop than the air-to-air variety of the same systems, and the first operational use of the Mark I followed in early 1940. A cleaned-up and repackaged version, ASV Mark II, replaced it at the end of the year, but the system was not widespread until late in 1941. ASV was useful for detecting U-boats at night, but the target had to be seen to be attacked, a problem that was addressed with the Leigh light. As German U-boat losses shot up in 1942, they concluded the RAF was using radar to detect them and responded with the Metox radar detector. The RAF responded by deploying the microwave-frequency ASV Mark III, which the Germans were unable to detect until the U-boat fleet had already been decimated. A series of other ASVs were developed for different aircraft as the war progressed. In the post-war era, several new ASV radars were developed, notably ASV Mark 7A, ASV Mark 13 and ASV Mark 21. By the late 1960s the original terminology was no longer being used, and the last major entries in the series were known simply as Searchwater and Seaspray. WWII developments Initial concept Avro Anson K8758 demonstrated ASV in commanding fashion in September 1937. Development of the original ASV systems started in 1937 after the team testing an experimental air-to-air radar noticed odd returns while flying near the shore of the English Channel. They eventually realized these were the docks and cranes at the Harwich docks miles south of them. Shipping also appeared, but the team was unable to test this very well as their Handley Page Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. To further test the concept, Robert Watson-Watt provided the team with two Avro Ansons that were able to fly out over the English Channel from nearby RAF Martlesham Heath. After several successful flights over the summer of 1937, Watt asked the team if they could be ready for a demonstration in September. On 4 September, the system was used to detect Royal Navy ships on manoeuvres in almost complete overcast. The weather was so bad they had to use the radar pattern from local sea-side cliffs to navigate home. Albert Percival Rowe of the Tizard Committee later commented that \\"This, had they known, was the writing on the wall for the German Submarine Service.\\" Mark I and II The antenna array of the Mark II was quite large and produced considerable drag. For a variety of reasons, the 1.5 m wavelength of the radar system worked better over water than land, and the large size and flat vertical sides of the ships made excellent radar targets. Production quality sets were available in 1939 and entered operational service in early 1940, becoming the first radar system to be mounted on an aircraft in a combat setting. A somewhat improved version, Mark II, followed in 1941, which saw tens of thousands of units produced in the UK, Canada, US and Australia. These designs had a relatively long minimum range, meaning the submarine targets disappeared from the display just as the aircraft was readying for the attack. At night, this allowed the submarines to escape detection. This was solved by the Leigh Light, a searchlight that lit up the submarines during the last seconds of the approach. By early 1942, Mark II and the Leigh Light were finally available on large numbers of aircraft. Their effect was dramatic; German U-boats had previously been almost completely safe at night, and could operate out of the Bay of Biscay in spite of it being close to British shores. By the spring of 1942, Biscay was increasingly dangerous, with aircraft appearing out of nowhere in the middle of the night, dropping bombs and depth charges, and then disappearing again in moments. The Germans ultimately solved the problem of Mark II with the introduction of the Metox radar detector. This amplified the radar's pulses and played them into the radio operator's headphones. With experience, the operators could tell whether the aircraft was approaching or just flying by. It provided this warning long before the echos from the submarine became visible on the aircraft's display, allowing the U-boat to dive and escape detection. By the end of 1942, Mark II had been rendered ineffective. Mark III The Mark III's small antenna was installed in a well-streamlined radome on the nose of the Wellington, forcing the removal of the guns in that location. With the radome of the Mark III well streamlined, the Leigh light installation was also cleaned up by placing it in a retractable \\"dustbin\\". The introduction of the cavity magnetron in early 1940 led to efforts to develop microwave-frequency versions of the various radars then in use, including a new ASV under the name ASVS for \\"Sentimetric\\". A prototype was available from Metrovick in the summer of 1942, but they predicted it would not be widely available until summer 1943. It was at this point that the Metox started to become effective. Robert Hanbury Brown suggested a new ASV could be quickly introduced by making minor changes to the new H2S radar, mostly to the antenna. This started a furious debate between RAF Bomber Command, who wanted every H2S for their bombers, and RAF Coastal Command, who wanted them for submarine hunting. After several changes in policy, the first ASV Mark III's began arriving in March 1943, and had largely replaced the Mark II in front-line units by the end of the summer. The Germans had no way to detect these signals, and their submarines were repeatedly attacked with no warning. The losses were so great they took to leaving port in the day, but the RAF responded with strike aircraft patrols and losses shot up once again. In August, shipping losses to submarines was the lowest since November 1941, and more U-boats were sunk than cargo ships. The Germans spent much of the next year using radar detectors at longer wavelengths in a fruitless attempt to find the new ASV. Further confusion was added by a captured Coastal Command pilot, who related that ASV was no longer used for search, but only in the last minutes of the approach. Instead, their aircraft were using a receiver tuned to the Metox intermediate frequency that allowed them to detect the submarines at as much as . This led to an urgent 13 August 1943 message from German Naval High Command ordering that submarines turn off their Metox. This incredible deception not only allowed Mark II to once again become effective but further delayed the German discovery of the true nature of the problem. The reason for the long delay in discovering Mark III is somewhat surprising given that a magnetron from H2S fell into German hands almost immediately after it was first used in February 1943. For reasons that are not recorded, the magnetron was either unknown to the German Navy, or they did not believe it could be used against U-boats. It was not until late 1943 that a naval version of the Naxos radar detector arrived, having originally been developed to allow German night fighters to track the RAF's H2S radars. Naxos provided very short detection range, about , too short to be really useful. Better detectors arrived very late in the war, but by that time the U-boat force had largely been destroyed. Other WWII developments The magnetron was revealed to the United States in 1940 during the Tizard Mission, and local development began at the MIT Radiation Laboratory in a matter of weeks. US development was not subject to the infighting in the RAF, but suffered its own series of setbacks and confusion. The early DMS-1000 proved to be an excellent unit, but for reasons unknown, the US War Department decided to put the inferior Western Electric SCR-517 into production instead. Meanwhile, Philco had been developing a system for blimps, the ASG, which was much better than the SCR-517. The RAF decided that UK-built aircraft would be fitted with their Mk. III, while any US aircraft in British service would use US sets. Initially, they planned on using the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, which had the range to operate over the Mid-Atlantic Gap, and an example of this aircraft with the DMS-1000 was sent to the UK for testing in early 1942. Another 30 arrived with a mix of DMS-1000, SCR-517 and ASG. However, when Bomber Command decided the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress was unsuitable for bombing operations, the Air Ministry ordered Coastal Command to take over their existing orders in spite of them having a shorter range that was unsuitable for closing the Gap. Coastal Command was able to have the radar switched to the ASG, which they operated under the name ASV Mark V. The TRE was sure the Germans would soon detect Mark III and render it ineffective as well, so they responded with a new ASV Mark VI that was essentially a more- powerful Mark III. The key trick to Mark VI was the \\"Vixen\\" device that allowed the operator to progressively mute the output as they approached the U-boat, hopefully fooling the radio operator into believing they were flying away. Mark VI never fully replaced Mark III in service, as truly effective detectors did not become available until the U-boat fleet had largely been destroyed. The failure of Naxos and later devices led to morale problems in the U-boat force. Another solution to the problem of being detected was to change frequencies. From 1943, both the UK and US began developing magnetrons that worked on even shorter wavelengths, first in the X-band at 3 cm wavelength, and later in the K-band at 1.25 cm. The UK-developed 3 cm version for the Liberator became ASV Mark VII, while the US version based on ASG was known as AN/APS-15 and given the UK designation ASV Mark X. It was expected the latter would be available in December 1943. The similar AN/APS-3 was mounted to Catalinas and named ASV Mark VIII. Late-war developments The Swordfish mounted the ASV Mark XI radome between its landing gear. In October 1944, the Germans introduced two innovations that were extremely worrying. One was the introduction of new classes of U-boats with much higher performance, and the other was the use of the schnorkel, allowing even older types to spend most of their time submerged. This made the X-band versions of ASV a requirement, as they had the resolution needed to detect the schnorkel. On 22 November 1944, it was decided to deploy new 3 cm-band ASV's, with both the UK and US developing versions. However, these demonstrated poor performance against the schnorkel, and experiments with these new systems were still underway when the war ended. In the immediate post-war era, development of the system continued as an air-sea rescue system, as it could detect life rafts even if they did not carry a transponder. In order to upgrade the Fairey Swordfish, which had previously used the early Mark II radars, the Mark X was further adapted as the Mark XI. This used a new narrow radome that fit between the Swordfish's landing gear. The radome's location made the carriage of a torpedo impossible, so these aircraft were fit with eight RP-3 rockets with armor-piercing warheads to damage or puncture the U-boat making it impossible to dive, and flares to mark the location for follow-up attacks by other aircraft carrying depth charges. Further developments of this system led to the Mark XIII, used on de Havilland Mosquitos, Bristol Beaufighters and Bristol Brigands. Post-war developments The Shackleton MR2 moved its Mark 13 radar to the ventral position in a well-streamlined installation. With the ending of World War II in 1945, the British believed another war was at least a decade off, and put little effort into new radar systems. The opening of the Cold War led to a rapid re-evaluation of this stance, especially as the Soviets were known to be introducing new submarines surpassing even the late- war German designs. Adding to the problem was the loss of the large numbers of Liberator aircraft with the ending of lend-lease. These had been used as very long-range patrol aircraft during the war, and their return to the US left Coastal Command with no suitable airframes to cover the GIUK gap. A solution was found by adapting surplus Bomber Command Avro Lancaster bombers with Mark VII to become the Lancaster GR.3. The use of Roman numerals had become pass√© by this point, and these units were referred to as ASV Mark 7A, remaining in service until 1954. This says that \\"some Lancaster Mk 3s were rapidly converted first for air-sea rescue duties and then, with the addition of ASV 13 radar, to the general reconnaissance role.\\" A more suitable custom-built patrol aircraft was a priority and led to the Avro Shackleton. The Shackleton Mk 1 and 2 mounted the ASV Mark 13 (ASV13). The main improvements were the addition of stabilization so the image did not change when the aircraft manoeuvred, and the use of a pressurised radome that kept out humidity and made it suitable for use in tropical areas. ASV13 was a centimetric radar with a detection range in a calm sea (Sea State 1) of about for a destroyer, for a surfaced submarine, and for a submarine conning tower. \\"In rougher conditions, the range would be much less.\\" By 1958, ASV13 was considered \\"old and rather unreliable\\". EMI developed a replacement, ASV Mark 21 (ASV21), which was cleared for service use in 1958, and came into operational use in the Shackleton Mk 2 and 3 beginning in 1959. ASV21 could detect a submarine schnorkel at \\"in very favourable conditions but at much shorter range in the sea states normally experienced in the North Atlantic.\\" ASV21 was generally similar to the earlier designs. ASV21 was also selected for the Mark II models of the Canadair CP-107 Argus, replacing the American AN/APS-20 of the Argus Mark I's. The Argus was widely described as the best anti-submarine aircraft of its era. ASV21D also equipped the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR 1 when it came into service in 1970, and was replaced by the Searchwater radar in the Nimrod MR 2 starting in 1980. ASV 21 remained in service on the Argus until the last example retired in 1981. ASV13 and ASV21 used magnetrons, which was a technology developed during World War II. \\"Searchwater was a completely new concept, having a high power wideband TWT transmitter and being the first generation of ASV radars to include modern signal and data processing (digital as well as analogue)\\". This gave Searchwater a better ability than ASV13 or ASV21 to detect small targets such as submarine pericopes against a background of strong sea returns. The radar screen for Searchwater could be viewed in daylight, unlike the screen of ASV21, which was viewed in a radar 'tent' on board the aircraft. Later developments Radar returned to the nose in the Nimrod, with this MR2 showing no outward sign of the Searchwater radar within. Seaspray on the Lynx was an export success, seen here in the Royal Thai Navy. The war-era radar classifications became less relevant in the 1970s as radar units increasingly became multi-purpose as opposed to being dedicated to a single role. Newer designs, even dedicated naval surveillance designs, were not assigned numbers in the ASV lineage. The first such example is the Seaspray, a small unit designed to be mounted on the Westland Lynx. This was originally developed in concert with the Sea Skua missile to allow the Lynx to attack fast attack craft at long range from their carrier ships. It has since been sold around the world and used in a variety of roles. The latest versions, Seaspray 7000, are completely rebuilt and share only the name with the original models. Another example is the Searchwater, which was designed to replace the Mk. 21 in a new version of the Nimrod, the MR2. These began arriving in 1979. In 1978, the Royal Navy retired its fleet carriers, losing the Fairey Gannet AEW.3 airborne early warning aircraft. A new version of Searchwater, the LAST, was created to provide this coverage when mounted under a Westland Sea King helicopter that was able to operate from a variety of ships. Several greatly improved versions followed, part of the Searchwater 2000 series.

A spur route of I-65, it extends from I-65 in Bowling Green to U.S. Route 60 (US 60) and US 231 in Owensboro. It opened in 1972 as the Green River Parkway and was renamed the William H. Natcher Parkway in 1994. It was designated as I-165 in 2019, after upgrades bringing it to Interstate Highway standards were completed. Route description I-65 exit for I-165 and KY 9007 The Interstate highway begins at a cloverleaf interchange with I-65 (exit 20) near Bowling Green. The portion of the former William H. Natcher Parkway between US 231 and I-65 is not a part of the Interstate Highway System as per federal regulations, and is designated as Kentucky Route 9007 (KY 9007). I-165 travels along the west side of the city in a northwesterly direction, through rolling farmlands and near coal mines, for before meeting its northern terminus at an interchange with US 60 in Owensboro. At exit 41, the freeway intersects with the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway. I-165 bypasses the cities of Morgantown, Beaver Dam and Hartford. History US 60 exit for I-165 (I-165's northern terminus) The highway that is now I-165 opened in 1972 as the Green River Parkway, and later became the William H. Natcher Parkway before receiving the I-165 designation. In early 2016, funding was set aside to rebuild and restore sections of the parkway to interstate standards.http://transportation.ky.gov/Program- Management/Documents/2016RecommendedProjectListing.pdf From July to August 2017, construction consisting of shoulder widening, draining and repaving was completed. Additional work is underway along the entirety of the parkway. In July 2018, major modernization upgrades began in the Warren County section, consisting of ramp extensions, guardrail replacement, LED lighting updates and bridge wall replacement. Traffic flow was restricted to one lane, wide loads were prohibited and the speed limit set to 55 mph. This work continued through the end of 2018. The US 231 interchange (exit 7) will be partially or completely revamped, and several interchange designs are being considered, including a dual-roundabout system. A new interchange will likely be constructed between the mile markers 3.4 and 4, allowing access to Elrod Road in Bowling Green. The presumed number for the parkway was I-565, but on September 24, 2017, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials' Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering approved the Natcher Parkway as I-165 instead. On September 5, 2018, it was announced that the entire parkway would be signed with I-165 shields by the end of 2019, even before completion of the parkway's upgrades, thus officially bringing it to Interstate status. On March 6, 2019, the resigning of the freeway began, thus officially designating it as I-165, with exit numbers reverting to the parkway's original exit numbers prior to its extension to US 231 in November 2011. In 2018, Representative Suzanne Miles of Owensboro introduced a bill that would have given the highway an honorary designation of \\"William H. Natcher Expressway\\", but the bill did not make it out of committee. Exit list See also  References External links *KentuckyRoads.com ‚Äî William H.

She participated in various international missions that took place at remote hospitals, often in dangerous areas. On December 17, 1996 she was murdered together with five of her colleagues when on a mission in Chechnya, Russia. Posthumously, she was awarded both the Florence Nightingale Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal. Life Born in Brockville, Ontario, on October 6, 1945, she studied at the KGH School of Nursing before completing her bachelor's degree in Nursing Science at Queen's University in 1969. After being a teacher in Montreal, she moved to Vancouver in 1979, where she worked as a nurse at Vancouver General Hospital. She joined the local Red Cross branch in 1987. Over the course of nine years, she was a director and medical administrator for six outpost hospitals in remote British Columbia. As well, she participated as a medical administrator and nurse during ICRC missions to Ethiopia (1990), Kuwait and Iran (1991), Belgrade (1993), Zaire (1995), and Chechnya (1996). Murder In the mission following a peace treaty between Russia and Chechnya, Nancy Malloy, together with six international Red Cross workers were located in a hospital in Novye Atagi, close to Grozny, the capital of the Chechnya region. On December 17, 1996, when the mission had been running for two and a half months, armed men entered the sleeping quarters of the hospital and shot and killed Malloy, together with five of her coworkers. In 2010, it was reported that a Russian special forces major had claimed to be part of the group which carried out the shooting, and that their intention was to target Chechen fighters. However, witnesses had claimed soon after the event that they had heard the attackers speaking Chechen, and that the Red Cross staff had been directly targeted. Honours A memorial plaque on the fatal attack is present in a school and former hospital in Novye Atagi. Nancy Malloy was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1997 by Governor General Romeo LeBlanc. As well, she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal by the ICRC, while receiving the Order of the Red Cross from the Canadian Red Cross in 2001. In addition, Queen's University's school of nursing administers the Nancy Malloy Memorial Award, handed out by her friends and classmates.

Design The CANT 23 was an entirely metallic aircraft with a conventional look, a three-engine, biplane with a fixed trolley. The fuselage, with a rectangular section, was made of duraluminium and was characterized by a closed passenger compartment equipped with 10 single armchairs that overlooked a series of 5 rectangular windows on each side. The cockpit was external, placed on the upper part in front of the wings in an open cockpit protected by a windshield. The wing configuration was biplane-sesquiplane with the upper wing, more open, connected to the lower, considerably smaller, thanks to a Warren truss configuration. Both were made with a structure of side members in profile and ribs in square section tube covered in painted canvas. Development In 1927 the airline company Societ√† Italiana Servizi Aerei (SISA), a company owned by the brothers Callisto and Alberto Cosulich as well as the CRDA, had begun to operate on the route that joined the Italian Trieste with Budapest, capital of the then Kingdom of Hungary. In anticipation of an increase in demand from the air transport market with the possibility of making new connections to Central and Eastern Europe and in particular the opening of a route capable of connecting Trieste airport - Ronchi dei Legionari or, alternatively, the new Noghere airport, then under construction near the village of Zaule, in Vienna to continue to Budapest. The project, the first of the CRDA-CANT that was not a seaplane, was supervised by the engineer Raffaele Conflenti, who at that time held the position of chief designer and director of the technical office of the company of Monfalcone, which took experience gained in the creation of the CANT 22 hydro line. The new aircraft, designated CANT 23, appeared to possess a conventional appearance and presented a new, for the company, fuselage made of duralumin characterized by the closed passenger compartment and an open cockpit for the pilot. The veiling and the three- engine propulsion in the tractor configuration were substantially similar to the previous CANT 22. The construction of the aircraft began as early as 1927, but its progress was not so fast, continuing until the beginning of the 1930s . [3] In 1929 a cell was created for static tests but the prototype, serial number NC.136, managed to be registered (I-ABLA) only on 11 July 1932. Although the design of CANT 23 benefited from all-metal construction, the constant development of the aeronautic industry determined the early technical aging of the model and definitively undermined any further development. The program was suspended on 1 May 1933 and the project was therefore abandoned.

Development In 1926 the Regia Aeronautica contacted the CNT assigning it a contract that provided for the supply of a prototype for a two-seater, single-engine long-life hydro-ridicitor. The task was entrusted to the chief designer of the company, Raffaele Conflenti, who developed the new model, which assumed the designation CANT 21, based on the previous CANT 10 and CANT 13 maintaining the biplana central hull and from which it was essentially differentiated a different design of the hull, without a keel and with a reduced redan. The CANT 21 was taken to the air for the first time in 1927 by the new test pilot of the company, the commander Adriano Bacula, then transferred to Vigna di Valle for comparative evaluations with the competitor Savoia-Marchetti S.62. However, the examining commission considered the S.62 much higher, declaring it the winner of the competition, but the Ministry of Aeronautics gave the CNT the necessary documentation authorizing its production for the foreign market. The company presented it to the public at the Prague Air Show of 1928, then offered to the governments of Argentina, Portugal and Turkey . Of these, only the Argentine government showed an initial interest, requiring a sample followed by a supply order for three others, subsequently reduced to one and then definitively terminated together with the first while the specimens were being built. According to other exemplary sources, however, it was delivered in 1930 and remained in service until 1940 in the Aviaci√≥n Naval. production had already started and the first completed, registered I-AALN, had been provisionally assigned to the flight school headquarters of the SISA airline near Portoro≈æ followed by a second one, registered I-AAPW. At the end of the 1930s a new competition was announced for a further supply to the Navy's Auxiliary Aviation of a new water-repeller for the replacement of the Savoia-Marchetti S.59. The CNT managed to secure a contract for the supply of a prototype again, developed as the development of CANT 21 and which took the designation 21bis. The new model, now suitable for three crew members, adopted a different hull, returned to a more classic solution, equipped with a keel and with a considerably lengthened redan, and which housed a second station for the tail machine gun positioned behind the wingspan. For the engine we chose an Isotta Fraschini Asso 500Ri, the version equipped with a speed reducer, installed in a tractor configuration and combined with a double metal propeller. After the first flight, carried out by Bacula on 13 April 1931, he was transferred to Vigna di Valle where he again competed with the Savoia-Marchetti S.62. The S.62 was able to guarantee better performance thanks to a more powerful engine, but before the deadline, the CNT tried to remedy the problem by launching an intense development program. We returned to the solution with a drive unit in a pushing configuration, enclosing it in a gondola to reduce the overall aerodynamic drag, and adopting a quadripal helix with variable pitch, with the possibility of adjustment to the ground, coming from another model. Also the wings were subsequently modified, decaled, and adopting Handley-Page flaps on the leading edge to improve the characteristics at low speeds. The improvements were able to increase the overall performance, but despite this the choice remained on S.62. However not even the Savoia-Marchetti obtained a supply contract because after a short time the competition was canceled for the second time.

Biography  Jane Lyon was born in Edinburgh in 1771. Lyon's father and elder brothers had been recruited in 1784 by Catherine the Great's Scottish architect, Charles Cameron, to assist in building works at Tsarskoe Selo, the imperial estate near St. Petersburg. When Jenny joined them later she was appointed nanny in 1796 to Catherine's grandson, the infant Grand-Duke Nicholas, the future Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas (1796-1855), caring for him until the age of seven and retaining his affection thereafter. He called her the 'nanny-lioness' (niania- l'vitsa), also known in Russian as Evgenia Vasil'evna Laion. She remained with the imperial family for almost 40 years and was described in 1835 as: > 'quite a character ... [T]hey all doted on her and could not exist without > her... she kept their money, their jewels etc. and had charge of > everything'.  The Scottish influence  Lyon was not the only Scottish nanny/governess recruited to imperial service. The empress Catherine had earlier appointed two Scottish nurses for her elder grandchildren: Pauline Gessler and Sarah Nichols, n. Primrose. In the nineteenth century, several more Scottish nurses entered the imperial household, including Catherine McKinnon (c. 1778 - 1858), employed during the reign of Alexander I as nanny to Alexander II (1818 - 81). These Scotswomen were 'responsible, it was said, for giving the Russian rulers a particularly Scottish lilt to their English'.  Bibliography  * Lincoln, W.B.

Pytko Walter Stanley Pytko (January 16, 1901 ‚Äì June 17, 1992) was a Democratic politician from Philadelphia. Active in Polish-American groups in Philadelphia's Bridesburg neighborhood, Pytko also became involved in local politics. He served one term in the Pennsylvania State Senate in the 1930s and worked in various government agencies through the 1940s and 1950s. In 1962, he was elected to the Philadelphia City Council, where he served until retiring in 1968. Family and education Pytko was born in 1901 in Philadelphia, the son of Polish immigrants Francis M. Pytko and Anna Borsuta Pytko. He grew up in Philadelphia's Port Richmond neighborhood and graduated from Roman Catholic High School. After high school, Pytko earned degrees from Temple University and Temple Law School. He was active in Polish-American groups in Philadelphia, joining the staff of the Polish Beneficial Association in 1922 and organizing the Polish-American Citizens League, a political group, in 1925. He also operated a real estate and insurance business. He married Helen Stachowiak around 1926, with whom he had one daughter, also named Helen. They remained married until her death in 1956. Political career State senate Representing the Polish-American Citizens League, Pytko joined a group of neighborhood leaders in endorsing the mayoral candidacy of Republican J. Hampton Moore in 1931. By 1932, he had moved to the Bridesburg neighborhood, switched his party allegiance, and was elected the Democratic leader of the 45th ward. He was nominated by the Democrats to run for state senate in the 8th district. He won, defeating Republican John J. McKinley by 64,406 to 57,394, picking up the seat for the Democrats. He was the first Polish-American elected to that body. Soon after joining the Senate, Pytko introduced a bill making it a crime to fraudulently receive poor relief, which passed unanimously. In 1936, he served as a presidential elector for Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won a second term in office. The following year, he helped draft a bill to create a state housing agency that would have the power to conduct \\"slum clearances\\" and supervise the local authorities that construct public housing, including the Philadelphia Housing Authority. He was re- nominated for the senate in 1938, but lost to Republican Louis H. Farrell by a vote of 79,985 to 71,266. Administrative agencies Following his defeat, Pytko was named to the newly created Employment Board of the Department of Public Assistance by outgoing Democratic Governor George Howard Earle III. Earle's successor, Republican Arthur James, recalled the last-minute appointments, and the state senate agreed to nullify them, including Pytko's appointment. He ran for sheriff of Philadelphia later that year, but withdrew in favor of former U.S. Attorney Gerald A. Gleeson, who lost to Republican David E. Watson. Meanwhile, Pytko helped organize relief for Poland as World War II ravaged that country. In December 1939, state auditor general Warren R. Roberts appointed Pytko to the Board of Mercantile Appraisers, a part of the taxation bureaucracy of the state. He traveled to the 1940 Democratic National Convention in Chicago as a member of the Pennsylvania delegation. The Pennsylvania delegates united on the choice of Roosevelt for a third term, but split over the vice presidency, with Pytko unsuccessfully backing Governor Lloyd C. Stark of Missouri. The Board of Mercantile Appraisers was abolished in 1943, its functions transferred to the State Department of Revenue. Starting in 1945, Pytko worked as the administrative assistant to state treasurer Ramsey S. Black. In 1947, the Democrats nominated him for Receiver of Taxes, but he lost to Republican W. Frank Marshall in the general election that year. Republican Governor James H. Duff, against the wishes of his own party members in Philadelphia, appointed Pytko to a spot on the Philadelphia Board of Registration Commissioners in 1949, filling a vacancy left by the death of another Democrat, Michael R. Kerwick. The appointment maintained the partisan balance on the Board, which was in charge of voter registration. Pytko served alongside Victor E. Moore, whom he would one day succeed on City Council. (The Registration Commission's duties were transferred to the City Commissioners in 1965). That same year, he resigned as head of the 45th ward. In 1951, the city adopted a new charter and the Democrats won the mayoral and council elections for the first time in decades. One of the charter changes involved the creation of a Department of Licenses and Inspections, and newly elected mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. appointed Pytko to head it. Pytko pledged stricter enforcement, saying that \\"Any inspector who takes a bribe or accepts money not only will be dismissed but also will be prosecuted.\\" Three months later, he dismissed ten such inspectors. The following year, Pytko concentrated his department's efforts on tenements that did not meet health and safety requirements. By 1955, his department had expanded and now employed 96 inspectors. He gained a reputation for honesty; according to Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Saul Schraga, Pytko became known as \\"the man who wouldn't do a favor.\\" Schraga quoted one city politico as saying Pytko \\"wouldn't let his own mother get by without a permit.\\" After five years at Licenses and Inspections, Pytko resigned to become the executive director of the Philadelphia Parking Authority. City council In 1962, Victor Moore resigned from his at-large seat on City Council, necessitating a special election later that year. Democratic ward leaders decided on Pytko. The nomination came as a surprise to many observers of the political scene, and his nomination was believed to be the choice of William J. Green, Jr., the Democratic organization's chairman. Pytko easily defeated his Republican opponent, James T. McDermott, for the seat, winning by more than 140,000 votes in the citywide election, a reduced but still sizable majority compared with the 1959 at-large vote. On Council, Pytko chaired the Committee on Public Works and Public Property. In the 1963 elections, Pytko won a full term on the Council, placing fourth among the five Democratic candidates who were elected. In December of that year, he introduced the resolution that renamed Municipal Stadium in South Philadelphia after President John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated a month earlier. Pytko clashed with mayor James H.J. Tate in 1964, accusing the mayor of creating unnecessary jobs in the city bureaucracy. In 1965, he focused on air pollution, calling for stricter enforcement of the city's regulation of industrial sites. Retirement In March 1967, Pytko announced that he would not seek re-election to city council, and would instead \\"now watch the parade go by.\\" He enjoyed a quiet retirement in Bridesburg until his death in 1992 at the age of 91. After a funeral at St. John Cantius Roman Catholic Church, he was buried in Most Holy Redeemer Cemetery in Bridesburg.

Engineer Raffaele Conflenti designed a biplane, wooden boat with a central hull, which was purchased on October 24, 1930 for 402,000 lire. He received the military matriculation MM.154. Temporarily transferred to Lisbon on December 21, 1931, he flew for the first time on May 18, 1932 . However, this aircraft did not develop, and the only specimen built was destroyed on June 23 six years later, following an accident.

He led soldiers in the Spanish conquest of territory from Chichameca tribes and was later made governor of the province of Jilotepec in early New Spain.  Early life  Juan Bautista Valerio de la Cruz was born Xicalchalch√≠lmitl in Texcoco. He was the descendant of the famous Texcocan poet-king (or tlatoani) Nezahualc√≥yotl. After the Spanish occupation of Mexico, Xicalchalch√≠lmitl was baptized by the city attorney of Mexico City, Don Bernardino de Santa Clara. According to the Jilotepec Codex, he received the name \\"Juan Bautista\\" because he was born on the feast day of John the Baptist (June 24), the name \\"Valerio\\" from his uncle, and the apellation \\"de la Cruz\\" because he arrived in Jilotepec on the day of the Day of the Cross (May 3). In 1527, when de la Cruz was 10 years old, he joined the royal militia and by 1529 he had been promoted to lieutenant of the royal guard of lance and shield. After two more years of service, de la Cruz retired to cultivate his land in Texcoco.  Military Command  De la Cruz returned to royal service in 1534 and was sent to occupy the then-frontier city of Jilotepec with 80 Spanish arquebusiers and 400 indigenous archers. In particular he was to protect the road to Zacatecas, one of the primary sources of Mexican silver. His other responsibilities were to contain the Chichameca incursions in the region, and maintain peace with the local indigenous population. Don Antonio de Mendoza, first viceroy of New Spain, ordered de la Cruz to raise an army and conquer territory where Chichameca tribes lived. Along with other local caciques ‚Äî notably Fernando de Tapia (Con√≠n) and Nicol√°s de San Luis ‚Äî he would go on to conquer the territory around \\"Jilotepec, Tula, San Miguel el Grande, Quer√©taro, Valle de San Felipe, Xich√∫, R√≠o Verde, Nueva Galicia, [and] Michoac√°n.\\" Cross of the Order of Santiago According to the Jilotepec Codex, de la Cruz actively reduced the number of smaller settlements, and evangelized to and converted the local Chichameca population. This was part of the Spanish strategy of conquest. By reducing the number of nomadic natives and relocating them into pueblos, the Spanish were reducing the number of potential soldiers for the Chichamecas, hastening the work of conversion, and facilitating extraction of wealth. It was said of him \\"nunca mostrar cari√±o a los indios y tenerlos muy sujetos [he never showed affection to the natives and had them very subjugated].\\" The Jilotepec Codex also suggests that de la Cruz was actively working with the Franciscans in their work of conversion. Valerio de la Cruz's work was so successful in the region that around 1540 he was elected to governor of the province, and by 1545 Mendoza had conferred upon him the title of Captain of the Great Chichameca. In 1550 he was named cacique and lord of Jilotepec. And in 1559, Lu√≠s de Velasco (second Viceroy of New Spain) named him Captain-General of the Chichamecas, replacing Nicol√°s de San Luis Monta√±√©s to lead the local Otomi people against the Chichamecas. Further, de la Cruz was granted a coat of arms by Holy Roman Emperor Carlos V and permission to don the cross and habit of the Order of Santiago by Felipe II of Spain.  Charitable Acts  Cruz del Atrio of Jilotepec During his time in the Jilotepec region, de la Cruz undertook many charitable acts. In 1565, thanks to the work of de la Cruz, the construction of the open chapel in Jilotepec (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Limpia Concepci√≥n) began. Its use was intended primarily for the local indigenous population. It measured 47 x 27 meters and was one of the largest open chapels of its time. He is credited with the construction of the first churches in Jilotepec (La Parroquia de San Pedro y San Pablo), Tula (La Catedral de San Jos√©), and Huichapan (Parroquia de San Mateo Ap√≥stol). He constructed the Cruz del Doend√≥ and reconstructed Jilotepec's Atrial Cross in front of the Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, two of Jilotepec's iconic stone crosses. Cruz de Doend√≥ in Jilotepec, Mexico In 1569 he began construction on multiple bridges in the region, notably in Jilotepec and Tula, to facilitate traffic on the Camino Real.  Death  Don Juan Bautista Valerio de la Cruz died in Jilotepec in 1589 and was buried with \\"ostentation,\\" \\"pomp, and solemnity\\" by order of the Viceroy in the Convent of Santiago in Tlatelolco, Mexico.

History  The SBe series of bombs were designed to be semi-armor piercing fragmentation bombs that could act as an adjunct to the SD series of bombs. There were two bombs in this series the SBe 50, and the SBe 250. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The SBe series was an effort to balance low cost, good fragmentation, and effective explosives. The SBe series achieved its fragmentation by embedding scrap metal in a layer of concrete instead of having a thick steel casing like the SD series. This concept had already been used successfully on the SD 10 A Type II and the SD 10 DW.  Design  The SBe 50 wasn't a single type but six closely related sub-variants intended to rectify shortcomings in the original design. None of the models were considered completely successful. The explosive for the Model A I was contained in a thin metal liner which the concrete was cast around. However, the Model A I was not satisfactory because the explosive charge was too large which pulverized the concrete instead of creating effective fragments. The Model C unsuccessfully attempted to address this problem by reducing the amount of explosives and increasing the thickness of the concrete. The Model D reduced the amount of explosive once again and increased the thickness of the concrete but the explosive charge was now too small. The Model E increased the amount of explosives back up to the amount used by the Model C, the internal metal container was eliminated, and the concrete was now cast around a rebar framework. The early models were filled with TNT but later models were filled with naphthalene a lower grade explosive that may have been used to promote fragmentation. Early models had sheet steel tails set in concrete while later models had detachable tails. The SBe 50 could be suspended vertically in a bomb bay or horizontally from a wing or fuselage hard point. The bombs were painted bright green in color.

Biography  In 1994, Lohana founded the Association for the Fight for Transvestite and Transsexual Identity (ALITT), which she presided over until her death. She was the driving force behind Law 3062 on respect for identity adopted by transvestites and transsexuals and approved by the Buenos Aires Legislature in 2009. In 2002, she starred in a fundamental demand for the visibility of transvestites and trans people by enrolling in Normal School No. 3 to become a teacher. Faced with the impossibility of doing so with her name, she lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman of the City of Buenos Aires, which ordered the school authorities to respect her gender identity. She was a legislative adviser (mandate fulfilled) at the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires for the Communist Party (led by Patricio Echegaray), thus becoming the first travesti person with a public job. She also worked as a legislative advisor for the Buenos Aires deputy Diana Maff√≠a, on issues such as Human Rights, Guarantees, Women, Children, Children and Adolescents. She was a candidate for national deputy in the year 2001, accepted in the electoral lists officialized by the Electoral Justice on the occasion of the renewal of positions of the Argentinian Congress. In 2008, she led the creation of the Nadia Echaz√∫ Textile Cooperative, the first Cooperative School for transvestites and transsexuals. It was named after Nadia Echaz√∫, as a tribute to the trans activist. The labor enterprise managed and administrated by travesti people was inaugurated in mid 2008, in a place donated by the National Institute of Associations and Social Economy (Inaes). In 2010, the National Front for the Gender Identity Law was created. It was an alliance of more than fifteen organizations that promoted the sanction at a national level of a law guaranteeing the adaptation of all personal documents to the gender identity perceived and the name chosen by each person and the access to medical treatments for those who request interventions on their body. The bill was finally presented (as a unified project, agreed between the different social organizations) and accepted. It was the only project that contemplated full access to health care. The Gender Identity Law was approved by the Argentine parliament on May 9th 2012 and promulgated by the President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner a few days later, becoming the most advanced in the world in this matter so far. It was the first law to recognize the gender identity of people in terms of self-perception and guarantee full access to health, depathologizing trans identities. In 2013, she was appointed head of the Office of Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation, which operates under the auspices of the Gender Observatory in the Justice departement of the City of Buenos Aires.

The site of the Khuld Palace is No. 23 The Khuld Palace () was one of the principal caliphal palaces in Baghdad during the early Abbasid Caliphate. History Baghdad was founded in 762 by the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (). The main part of the original city was the Round City, with the first caliphal palace, the Palace of the Golden Gate, at its centre. In 773, al-Mansur began construction of another palace on an elongated, mile-long stretch of land between the walls of the Round City and the western bank of the Tigris River. The palace and its extensive gardens was located between the Round City's Khurasan Gate and the western entrance of the city's Main Bridge of Boats leading across the Tigris. Al-Mansur reportedly chose this site because at this spot the Tigris bank was the highest above the river, and thus protected the palace from the ubiquitous insects along the river bank. The site was noted for its fresh air. It was named \\"Palace of Eternity\\" (Qa·π£r al-Khuld) from a passage in the Quran alluding to Paradise, the \\"Palace of Eternity promised to the God-fearing\\", because its gardens were said to almost rival the garden of Paradise. According to Ya'qubi, before the palace was a large review ground, adjacent to the royal stables. While the Palace of the Golden Gate was the official caliphal residence, after the Khuld Palace was inaugurated in 775 al-Mansur as well as his successors up to Harun al-Rashid () frequently used both residences, with Harun reportedly favouring the Khuld during his stays in Baghdad. The palace, like the nearby Palace of Zubaydah, suffered extensive damage from stone missiles during the Siege of Baghdad (812‚Äì813). The Khuld Palace was likely in ruins at the end of the siege, although at least one source claims that al-Ma'mun () stayed there when he came to Baghdad in 819, before the Hasani Palace was prepared for his residence. Following the move of the capital to Samarra under al-Mu'tasim (), the remains of the structure further decayed, and it remained in a ruined state until 979, when the Buyid ruler 'Adud al-Dawla decided to build the Al-'Adudi Hospital on its site.

The applications for this software lie in particular in the process industries for the engineering, operation, and maintenance of process plants as well as their asset management.  History  The COMOS (acronym for Component Object Server) software system was originally developed and sold by the Logotec Software GmbH, then by the innotec GmbH (founded in 1991 with headquarters in Schwelm, Germany). The first version hit the market in 1996. In 2008, the innotec GmbH was taken over by the Siemens Corporation COMOS is developed further and marketed by a subsidiary, the Siemens Industry Software GmbH. The current status is COMOS Generation 10.  Product characteristics  Originally, COMOS was developed as an integrated CAE system for engineering in plant construction: all process engineering trades and the involved disciplines of the Electrical, Instrumentation & Control system engineering should be able to work together seamlessly on one system platform. The system incorporates the characteristics of object orientation, central data administration, and open system architecture. Interfaces enable the integration into existing IT infrastructures or cooperation with supplementary software systems. The COMOS software system is based on a central data platform and includes applications that can be combined. They help with the engineering and set-up, operation, and shut-down of industrial plants.  Applications  The software is used by plant developers (e.g. EPC) to plan process plants (chemical, energy, water / waste water, pharmaceuticals, oil, natural gas, food, etc.). It is also used by plant owner/operators in the mentioned industries, since COMOS not only supports engineering but also operational processes. There are regular user conferences. Its architecture makes COMOS suitable for engineering: it can manage large quantities of data and provide it on an integrated basis. Siemens cooperates in the standardization of export and import interfaces (DEXPI - Data Exchange in the Process Industry), an initiative together with BASF, Bayer, and Evonik.  Scope of functions  The software system is modular. The functionalities of the COMOS platform support the digital transformation of a plant via the object-oriented data base and a special layer technology that permits joint and consistent work on data and documents. Object properties or attributes can be changed in data sheets and various entry masks. Batch queries and changes are also possible. The system is used to design process engineering. Integration into standard process simulators results in the definition of process data at an early planning stage using process flow diagrams and combination with the engineering of processing plants. Another module is used to make this data more precise. The pipework engineering based on piping and instrumentation diagrams followed specified industry standards for the respective pipe classes. Data is exchanged in the further geometrical planning using isometries based on ISO 15926. At the end one gets the virtual 3D design of the plant. The system serves for the electrical engineering of plants all the way to their complete automation: it covers electrical, measurement, control, and regulation (EMSR) processes. Functional plans and sequences can be generated based on common standards. Sequence controls can also be represented graphically. This information can be exchanged directly with distributed control system (DCS) process control systems such as Simatic PCS 7. It supports plant operation after start-up. Engineering data can be used and expanded in the operating phase. There are solutions for maintenance during operation, during inspections, or during maintenance down-time. Repairs or maintenance work can be reported directly from the field to the central system using mobile maintenance processes. It permits traceable document and data management. It meets the strict requirements of the FDA. Secure access possibilities permit work with distributed information all over the world. It also makes it possible to train plant personnel with visualization and simulation in 3D VR models combined with corresponding training scenarios. Walkinside was developed by the 3D specialist VRcontext and was integrated into the software after the takeover of the company by Siemens in 2011.

She was married to engineer David Gray Jarvie, with whom she had two sons, Colin and Grant.  Swimming career  Jarvie was one of only two women to win all Scottish swimming championship titles from 50 to 1,000 yards, and swam with Motherwell Ladies' Relay Team. She broke the Scottish breaststroke record in 1945, and held the Scottish senior titles from 1944 to 1948. Along with her husband David Jarvie, she was part of an aquatic team that won 172 Scottish and 47 British records between 1936 and 1960.  Counselling career  Jarvie worked in counselling for more than 40 years. She was on the staff of the University of Edinburgh's Moray House for 24 years where she was a course leader in guidance and counselling and contributed to the establishment of the first award-bearing course on counselling for those working in welfare and healthcare. In 1955, Jarvie signed up for a counselling training scheme and went on to become the youngest marriage guidance counsellor in Scotland and one of the Scottish Marriage Guidance Council's first educational tutors. She became very interested in how schools handled guidance counselling, and went on to study sociology at the University of Edinburgh because she \\"thought educators would listen more\\" if she was a teacher. Jarvie was also employed by the Bank of Scotland to counsel employees involved in traumatic bank raids. In his book The Persons in Relation Perspective: In Counselling, Psychotherapy and Community Adult Learning, author Colin Kirkwood acknowledges the influence of Jarvie, in particular through her involvement in the Gorbals Group and the Iona Community, where Jarvie and her husband worked together on the Rowen Engineering project. *  References  Category:1928 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Scottish swimmers Category:Scottish sociologists Category:People from Motherwell ","title":"Margaret Jarvie"},{"id":"60173648","text":"Beti Jones (1919-2006) was a Scottish social worker.

He is also suspected in the deaths of another two women, but hasn't been charged in their deaths. Johnson was convicted of the three murders and given three consecutive life sentences. Biography Early life Born as one of two twins into a family including 9 other siblings, Johnson grew up in Hartford's Blue Hills and Asylum Hill neighborhoods. At age 12, he lost sight in one of his eyes when he was shot with a pellet gun. He was described as a very sweet child, but whom exhibited immature behavior such as sucking his thumb when he was asked to do something he did not want to do. His kindergarten teacher later stated to a psychologist that he was highly aggressive and unable to cope with denial. By the time he was a teenager, he had been admitted to the Connecticut Children's Medical Center and repeatedly evaluated. Although he was noted for doing well in music and physical education, Johnson had a limited academic ability due to his intellectual disability and also suffered from seizures, which had to be medicated. His recorded IQ is 69. At age 17, Johnson had very little contact with his father, but still visited his family on the weekends. He had also grown tired of evaluations and stopped taking his medication, as he claimed it made him feel dizzy. When he reached adulthood in 1980, Johnson grew depressed and began mixing drugs and alcohol to calm himself. At one point, however, he managed to seek help at The Institute of Living in Hartford, earning his high school equivalency diploma before beginning work as a laborer. Crimes At 19 years of age, while he living in a home for troubled youth, Johnson tried to kill a security guard during an attempted robbery inside Asylum Hill's Cathedral of St. Joseph. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for this attack, but only served 4 and was then released. Before that, in May 1980, he robbed and assaulted a pregnant woman. In 1988, Johnson forcefully restrained a woman on the street, and about two years later, he raped and beat another woman. In both instances, he was caught because the women managed to identify him. After his eventual release from prison and now a homeless drifter, Johnson began luring drug-addicted prostitutes to secluded areas around Hartford. After having sex with them, he would then strangle before repeatedly stomping his victims, crushing their necks and skulls in the process. His victims were: * Aida Quinones (33) - killed in April 2000 * Rosali Jimenez (33) - killed in August 2000 * Alesia Ford (37) - killed in July 2001 Johnson is also suspected, but not charged in, the deaths of another two women who died in a similar fashion: * LaDawn Roberts (28) - found dead on a back porch in Garden Street, June 1999 * Rosalind A. Casey (32) - found dead on Sigourney Street, June 2000 Arrest and sentence After forensic scientist Henry Lee managed to connect the similar deaths using the DNA test results, authorities in the city began hunting for the women's killer. Using semen, blood splatters and cigarette butts found on each of the bodies, they put it in a database for convicted sex offenders and obtained a match for Matthew Steven Johnson. He was arrested on January 13, 2002 and subsequently brought to trial. During the court hearing, Gabriel Jimenez, brother of Rosali Jimenez, pleaded the jury to give Johnson the max penalty. When asked to respond, the accused said that he felt for the victims' families, but still refused to admit his guilt. When he heard the announcement of his verdict, Johnson remained slumped down in his chair, looking straight ahead and without response. In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the verdict, after Johnson failed to persuade the court that he should've had three separate trials for the deaths. He also claimed that he couldn't have had his DNA on them, as he hadn't had sex with a woman since 1982.

History Bharatpur is an ancient place. The University of Burdwan, in collaboration with the Archaeological Survey of India, carried out excavations at Bharatpur. Several statues of Gautama Buddha were found and the remains of a Buddhist stupa was unearthed. In 1994-95, the Burdwan Gazeteer had commented that the style of construction indicated that the stupa at Bharatpur was built during 7-9th century. The lower portions of the excavations indicated the presence of a neolithic-chalcolithic habitation which remained deserted till the time of construction of the stupa.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol II, pages 579-580, Radical Impression.

Biography  Minnie Bronson was from Fayette, Iowa. Her father, Harvey S. Brunson, came from Ohio and worked as a minister, a hotel operator, and a director of Upper Iowa University. Her mother, Jane McCool, was originally from Illinois. Bronson was the youngest of five siblings. Bronson graduated from Upper Iowa University with an A.B. and M.A. During her time in university she participated in several oratorical contests; one of her competitions was attended by social reformer Jane Addams, who would comment on the performance in her autobiography. Bronson worked as a high school mathematics teacher in St. Paul, Minnesota from 1889 to 1899. Beginning in 1900, she led the design of educational exhibits at world's fair expositions including Paris (1900), the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo (1901), St. Louis (1904), Li√®ge (1905), Jamestown, Virginia (1907), and Seattle (1909). She also held a number of short-term assignments working for the U.S. government, including as a Special Agent for the Bureau of Labor investigating labor conditions for women and children from 1907 to 1909 and Special Agent reporting on the New York shirtwaist strike in 1910. During World War I, Bronson was a member of the American Committee for Devastated France and traveled throughout France. She presented about the organization's work to the Iowa Bankers Association convention in 1919.  Anti-suffragist activity  Bronson served as General Secretary for the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage (NAOWS), the United States' leading anti-suffrage organization based in New York City. She edited their weekly periodical, the Woman Patriot, that distributed anti- suffrage opinion across the country. In December 1913, Bronson addressed the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Woman Suffrage representing the \\"anti\\" perspective, alongside speeches given by prominent suffragists Anna Howard Shaw, Helen H. Gardener, Carrie Chapman Catt, and Ida H. Harper. A skilled orator and organizer, Bronson was active in speaking tours and debates in New York and other states throughout the U.S., together with Josephine Jewell Dodge, the president of NAOWS. Her campaigning took her across the country including California, Nevada, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Washington D.C., and Virginia. She also organized training classes to teach others how to dissect pro-suffrage arguments. With her background as a wage-earning woman - in contrast to many prominent anti- suffragists of the period, who came from wealthy families - Bronson was able to promote her connection with the working class in her public speaking and writing. Her events were often well-attended, though sometimes attracted significant attention and criticism from her pro-suffrage opponents. During a visit to Nevada in 1914, Bronson was escorted from the theatre where she had been speaking and, according to local news reports, \\"agitators\\" set the building on fire. In her speeches and reports, Bronson maintained that granting the vote to women would not have a positive impact on improving women's social and economic circumstances. A frequently-referenced line of argument held that opening up the vote to all women would dilute the influence of educated and reform-minded women who were better positioned to affect the political change she desired. Before an audience of 150 women in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Bronson was reported to have said: \\"In attaining the ballot, we believe that the best women would throw away the advantage which is now in their hands. In shaping public opinion, the intelligent and good woman now counts immeasurably, while the ignorant and vicious woman counts scarely at nil. But at the ballot box, both would be equal.\\" Bronson, together with Massachusetts anti-suffragist Alice George, created a recording of the song \\"The Anti-Suffrage Rose\\" featured at the New York State Fair.

They are known for reporting high severity security vulnerabilities in a variety of products. IOActive has offices in Seattle, London, Dubai and Madrid. IOActive has done researches on smart cities and the transportation and technology that connects them, and has worked with Global 500 companies in multiple industries.  History  In 2018, IOActive was awarded CREST accreditation for its penetration testing services. In 2019, the company was recognized as one of the ‚ÄúMost Important Industry Companies of the Last 30 Years‚Äù by SC Media in their 30th Anniversary Awards.  Research   ATM Hack  In 2010, Barnaby Jack, Director of Security Research at IOActive, demonstrated his ability to remotely reprogram an ATM over a network to allow him to access cash in the machine. He was also able to access cash from a Triton ATM by using a key to open the machine‚Äôs front panel, as it was discovered that the ATM uses a uniform lock on all of its systems. In 2017, Mike Davis, Director of Embedded Systems Security at IOActive, and Josh Hammond, a Senior Security Consultant at IOActive, demonstrated their ability to hack one of Diebold Nixdorf's popular Opteva ATMs into completely spewing out its entire stash of cash in seconds during IOActive‚Äôs ‚ÄúBreaking Embedded Devices‚Äù panel at Black Hat 2017. The security flaw near the ATM's speakers in the upper section provided an opening for potential hackers to loosen and expose a USB port.  Car Hack  In 2015, Charlie Miller, a researcher at Twitter and Chris Valasek, Director of Vehicle Security Research at IOActive, constructed a demo with Wired reporter Andy Greenberg in which Greenberg was instructed to drive a Jeep Cherokee on a highway as Valasek and Miller hacked the car from approximately 10 miles away. The two were able to control car functions such as air conditioning, radio, windshield wipers, and even the brakes or engine from a remote computer. This discovery urged automakers to consider automotive security as a legitimate concern as the industry began a shift of turning cars into high-functioning computers and competing to install new Internet-connected cellular services for entertainment, navigation, and safety.  SATCOM Security   Overview  In 2014, Ruben Santamarta, Principal Security Consultant at IOActive, discovered major vulnerabilities in satellite communication (SATCOM) equipment that could be abused to hijack and disrupt communications links to airplanes, ships, military operations, and industrial facilities. These design flaws would allow attackers to run their own code, install malicious firmware, cut off communications, or even spoof messages to the vessel. Santamarta also found that certain weaknesses made it possible to locate cargo ships and military bases that were intended to remain hidden. The discovery exposed vulnerabilities in the equipment from six major companies. = Cobham GMDSS = Insecure protocol could compromise the entire terminal communications suite, in which an attacker could control devices by data spoofing or disrupting communications through the installation of malicious firmware.

As of 2019, Rudolf is a Professor at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials, University of Groningen, Netherlands.  Biography  Born in Munich, Rudolf moved to Italy to complete high school and to receive her MSc degree (magna cum laude) in physics at the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. Following, she worked at the National Surface Science Laboratory in Trieste for five years, interrupted two times to work on the newly discovered fullerenes at Bell Labs, USA. In 1995, she received her PhD (magna cum laude) in physics under the supervision of Roland Caudano at Facult√©s Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix, Namur, Belgium. After several research positions in Namur, she became professor in Experimental Solid State Physics at the University of Groningen in 2003. In addition to her research, Rudolf also has been active in spreading knowledge on how unconscious biases impact careers in science, and how to mitigate that influence through advocating positive action programs. Efforts by Rudolf and colleagues have been pivotal in installing the Rosalind Franklin Fellowship program at University of Groningen, which has been recognized by the 2018 Diversity Award from The Netherlands Physics Association.  Research  Petra Rudolf's research focuses on surface physics of organic thin films, molecular motors, nanocomposites, as well as 2D materials, to gain a better understanding of the physical phenomena that they display and for potential technological innovations. Rudolf's expertise has been on the application of various surface sensitive spectroscopic measurement techniques (x-ray and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, inverse photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, as well as low energy- and time-resolved electron diffraction) to study the various materials systems. While these techniques have been used by Rudolf and her group to study a wide variety of materials, Rudolf has always maintained a special interest in graphene-based materials and, more recently, also in 2D materials . Graphene-based materials have great potential in revolutionizing today's electronics industry and making it more sustainable, and Rudolf's lab has contributed successfully to finding better ways to produce 2D materials. More recently, Rudolf has also been devoted to developing pillared graphene materials for spintronics and hydrogen storage applications. Her interests span much further than carbon-based materials however, with recent successes with germanane-based and other materials which show promising devices and catalysis applications. As of 2019, Rudolf's work on synthetic molecular switches and molecular machines for the production of functional surfaces, in collaboration with renowned colleagues, such as Ben Feringa, is also ongoing.  Awards and honours  Petra Rudolf is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, awarded \\"for explorations of fullerenes, nanotubes, graphite, and graphene, as well as light-driven synthetic molecular motors\\". She is also a Fellow of the Institute of Physics and an honorary member of the Italian and the Dutch Physical Society. In 2007, Rudolf and her research group was one of the winners of the EU Descartes Prize for their work on molecular machines, as part of the SynNanoMotor consortium, a collaborative partnership of researchers from countries including France, Italy and Scotland. This work was pivotal in building early synthetic nanomachines. In 2013, Rudolf received the royal decoration and was appointed Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau. In 2016 Rudolf was elected Member of the German National Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech).

Morgan & Co. for 39 years. Early life He was a son of Isaac Nevett Steele (1809‚Äì1891) and Rosa Londonia (n√©e Nelson) Steele (1825‚Äì1894). Among his siblings was the Rev. James Nevett Steele of Trinity Church (his wife as a daughter of Herman D. Aldrich), Mary Steele, John Nelson Steele, Rosa Nelson Steele, Kate Steele, Henry Maynadier Steele. His father was a \\"distinguished lawyer\\" who was \\"universally recognized for years as the leader of the Maryland Bar\\" and served as the Charg√© d'Affaires, Venezuela under three U.S. Presidents, serving from 1850 to 1853. He was the nephew of Rep. John Nevett Steele, and Mary Nevett Steele, who married John Campbell Henry (the eldest son and heir of Gov. John Henry). His maternal grandfather was U.S. Representative, U.S. Ambassador to Italy and U.S. Attorney General John Nelson and his great-grandfather was Revolutionary War Brig. Gen. and U.S. Rep. Roger Nelson.

Buchanan, the former head of the law department of the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad, in the firm of Buchanan & Steele, with Steele becoming general counsel of the Erie. Seward, Guthrie & Steele on February 1, 1892. In the 1890s, Morgan partner Charles H. Coster retained Steele to assist with reorganizing certain railroad interest, including the reorganization of the Erie Railroad. In 1900, Coster died and J. Pierpont Morgan invited Steele, during Coster's funeral, to become a partner in J.P. Morgan & Co. Steele then \\"played an important but unpublicized part in the affairs of the firm until 1934, when, because of his age, he gave up active participation. He remained a partner, however, until his death, although he gave up his many corporate directorships at his retirement.\\" At the time of his admission, a single partnership agreement governed both the American and French houses of Morgan, therefore, Steele was admitted as a partner in the New York firm, the Philadelphia firm (Drexel, Morgan & Co.) and the Paris firm (Morgan, Harjes & Co.). Steele, who became a close friend of Morgan, served on the corporate boards of the International Mercantile Marine Co., the U.S. Steel Corporation, the Southern Railroad Company, the International Harvester Company, Cerro de Pasco, and the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad. Personal life The Steele Mansion in New York, designed by the firm of Haydel & Shepard, 1900 In 1885, Steele was married to Richmond-born Ann \\"Nannie\\" Gordon French (1866‚Äì1932).

The Steele's maintained residences in New York City (a Beaux-Arts mansion at 11 East 62nd Street), in Old Westbury, and a large cottage in Southampton, New York. Together, Charles and Nannie were the parents of three daughters: * Eleanor Herndon Steele (1893‚Äì1977), who married Count Jean de la Greze of Paris in 1910. They divorced in 1920, and she married Dr. Louis Debonnesset in 1920. They also divorced and she married H. Hall Clovis in 1930. They too divorced and she remarried for the fourth and final time to Emmet P. Reese (d. 1982) in 1941. * Nancy Gordon Steele (1894‚Äì1955), who married Devereux Milburn (1881‚Äì1942) in 1913. * Kathryn Nevitt Steele (1896‚Äì1981), who married Francis Skiddy von Stade Sr. (1884‚Äì1967) in 1915.

A devoted director of the Metropolitan Opera Association for the Metropolitan Opera House, he was also a member of the Racquet and Tennis Club, the Metropolitan Club, the Piping Rock Club, the Meadow Brook Club, the National Golf Links of America and the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. Steele died at his home in Westbury on August 5, 1939. After a funeral at St. Thomas' Church at Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street, where 100 seats were reserved for employees of J.P. Morgan (including Junius S. Morgan and Thomas W. Lamont), he was buried at the Locust Valley Cemetery on Long Island. After his death, his estate was valued at $29,498,373 (equivalent to $ today), including a $23,122,904 interest in J.P. Morgan. Each of his daughters received $1,500,000 (equivalent to $ today) and an interest in the remainder of the estate. Philanthropy Steele was noted for his generous philanthropy both during his lifetime, and after his death which totaled $5,000,000 (equivalent to $ today). A lover of music and former pupil of Dr. T. Tertius Noble, he gave $100,000 (equivalent to $ today) in 1922 to St. Thomas' Church for the purchase of buildings for a permanent choir school, today known as the Saint Thomas Choir School, which was founded in 1919. He gave an additional $300,000 (equivalent to $ today) to endow the school in 1925, and another $100,000 to the Church upon his death.

In his 1987 Goddard College thesis,McConnell, P. (1987). The Art of Improvisation. Senior Thesis. Goddard College, Plainfield, Vermont. McConnell wrote that Duggan was ‚Äúthe single most important person‚Äù in helping improve his improvisational playing.  Background  Born in Washington, DC, Duggan moved with his family to the suburbs of New York City at the age of five. He began playing piano early on, taking a couple years of classical lessons in grade school, followed by several years of jazz lessons with Joel Forbes in high school. Duggan's first job was at age fifteen, sitting in for Dave McKenna. Living close to New York City in the late 1950s, Duggan went to hear the jazz icons of that era, but ended up going to college in Boston where he studied for a few months with Margaret Chaloff. Since that time, Duggan has continued to work and compose, with various non-musical jobs interspersed throughout.  Career  In 1978, Duggan received a grant from the Vermont Council on the Arts to write music, which resulted in The Lake Studies, a series of sixteen eponymously named songs recorded by Charles Eller and released on Duggan's Aerie label. Two years later, Philo records re-recorded half the songs and released an album in 1980, which was reviewed by Keyboard in October 1981. In 2001, Duggan re- released his original 1978 recording. The Lake Studies remains Duggan's sole recorded material, as he has eschewed a typical musician's life of travelling and recording. Duggan has given private piano lessons over the years, including to Page McConnell when the latter was starting in Phish. McConnell credits Duggan for teaching him fundamental improvisational techniques and methods.  Personal life  Duggan has lived in the Burlington area of Vermont since 1967, and rarely ventures outside the area.

The film is about a submarine's sonar officer Chanteraide (Fran√ßois Civil), who must use his brilliant sense of hearing to track down a French ballistic missile submarine and end the threat of nuclear war.  Plot  The French submarine Titan - Le Titane (Titanium) in the original French version - is sent near the Mediterranean coast of Tartus, Syria to stealthily recover a French Special Forces unit operating in the area. The submarine sails under the command of Captain Grandchamp and Executive Officer (XO) D'Orsi. However, during their mission they encounter an unidentified sonar contact. The sonar expert of the submarine, Chanteraide ‚Äî nicknamed \\"Socks\\", and serving as \\"golden ear\\", the officer specialized in underwater acoustics ‚Äî first classifies the contact as a wounded whale, but it quickly turns out that the contact is an unknown submarine transmitting their position to an Iranian frigate and a maritime helicopter operating in the area. The helicopter launches depth charges in what seems to be an unprovoked act of aggression which, however, is a valid defensive measure as the Titan is in fact violating sovereing Syrian waters while recovering an invasion force that has already engaged in combat and killed syrian nationals. After evading the barrage, the Titan surfaces, and the captain shoots down the helicopter with a Panzerfaust 3. They recover the Special Forces unit and return to base. When the Titan returns to base, the radio announces that Russia is invading Finland's √Öland Islands, and that the French President has decided to send a naval task force to the Baltic Sea in support of Finland. Moscow then threatens nuclear retaliation against the French Republic. Chanteraide, trying to identify the unknown contact in Syria, discovers that it is in fact a Russian Timour III ballistic missile submarine, supposedly dismantled. Meanwhile, Grandchamp is promoted for his actions to command Formidable - L'Effroyable (The Dreadful) in the original French version - while D'Orsi takes over command of Titan. The next day, the French military command detects a Russian R-30 nuclear missile being launched by the Timour III from the Bering Sea, prompting the French President to order the Formidable to launch its nuclear missiles against Russia in response. In the command bunker, Chanteraide, while listening to the record of the launch, finds an anomaly: the missile is too light, because it was launched without a nuclear warhead. Reporting this to the admiral in command of the Strategic Oceanic Force (codename: ALFOST), he's present when the US Secretary of State calls the ALFOST to report a critical intel: the terrorist organisation Al-Jadida obtained the decommissioned Timour III and launched an empty missile at France, tricking the French into the irrevocable procedure to launch a nuclear counterstrike from the Formidable. The ALFOST and Chanteraide then enter the Titan to stop this nuclear launch by all means necessary. Grandchamp prepares to fire the nuclear missile, following procedure and eliminating all outside communication while maintaining the submarine in stealth mode. After D'Orsi is rebuffed in his efforts to communicate with Grandchamp via underwater telephone, he attempts to approach Formidable in person. He is killed when Grandchamp launches torpedoes at Titan to prevent their attempts to foil his missile launch. While the timer to missile alignment counts down, Titan simultaneously launches their own torpedo at Formidable. While Chanteraide breaks down under the pressure of targeting his ship, the ALFOST is able to use his experience commanding Formidable to predict Grandchamp's evasive actions. Titan's torpedo hits Formidable's bridge, impacting just seconds before Formidable's torpedo similarly hits Titan. Grandchamp is able to release ballast air and throw the torpedo enough off target to prevent direct impact, although the control room is devastated. Formidable's torpedo directly hits Titan which begins to sink. Grandchamp orders the evacuation of the carbon monoxide filled control room and denies appeals to issue an SOS call, intending to follow orders and launch the missile first. As Chanteraide and the ALFOST, the sole survivors of the impact, escape the burning area of the ship, Chanteraide makes a last call to the Formidable over underwater telephone. Chanteraide recalls Grandchamp's prior trust in him, and begs him not to arm the missile, before saying goodbye in the face of his impending death on the stricken Titan. With his dying breath, Grandchamp removes the nuclear targeting board, preventing the missile from being launched. The ALFOST is able to evacuate Chanteraide via the escape hatch, but is unable to do so himself. Chanteraide is rescued and is seen at the memorial for the fallen French sailors, and reunites with his girlfriend Diane.

Gallagher calls The Wolf's Call \\"...pulse-pounding action and military intrigue on a level you just don‚Äôt see from Hollywood filmmaking anymore\\" that is, while being \\"familiar and predictable\\", still a \\"well-constructed\\" movie. He states that while the film's $22 million production budget is much lower than a similar US film would get, the French film does well within its budgetary constraints. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 6.25/10.

She worked in a number of academic libraries in the United States and Canada before serving as chief librarian at Seneca College. In addition to writing for Chatelaine, she co-founded and edited Emergency Librarian, a publication focused on feminist issues in librarianship, with Phyllis Yaffe. Following her position at Seneca, she worked at the Canadian Periodical Publishers Association and the Ontario Arts Council before taking a position with the Ontario Ministry of Culture and Communications. Early life and education Cheda was born in Osgood, Indiana February 15, 1936. N√©e Schneider, her father Abraham was a Russian Jew who had traveled on foot from Kiev to Hamburg to escape the pogroms that followed the Russian Revolution. He eventually settled in Indiana where he married Myrtle Stout. Cheda was the eldest of their four children. She graduated from high school as valedictorian and was the first member of the family to receive a university education. She studied briefly at Hanover College before enrolling at the University of Indiana where she completed a bachelor's degree in 1958. Cheda completed a master's degree in library science from the same university in 1963 after a break in her studies following a relocation to San Francisco and then Baltimore with her husband, Noel Perry, and their two children, in pursuit of work. Career After working for a time at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, Cheda and her family returned to San Francisco where she held a librarian position at the San Francisco State College. Following the end of her marriage to Perry, she left the United States on July 4, 1967, along with her children and then partner Micheal Cheda, in protest of the country's involvement with the Vietnam War. They landed in Vancouver, British Columbia where she worked in library roles at the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University. The couple was married from 1969 to 1975 during which time they relocated to Toronto, Ontario. For at time Cheda worked in the Indian-Eskimo Association of Canada's library before becoming chief librarian at Seneca College. She held the position from 1973 to 1978 before serving as Chair, Applied Arts Division until 1979. After leaving her position at Seneca College, Cheda served as executive director of the Canadian Periodical Publishers Association. Although the association was close to bankruptcy when she accepted the position, its financial outlook was improved in less than a year following her efforts to gain support from member organizations before implementing a system to help better distribute and promote publications. Beyond her work with the CPPA, Cheda also worked for the Ontario Arts Council and before later holding office with the Ontario Ministry of Culture and Communications. Feminist writing Cheda was a feminist and shared progressive views as a Chatelaine columnist. Her worked covered a range of topics ranging from having male children make their own lunches and contribute to housework to accounts of her experience as a liberated housewife. Though her writing elicited angry responses from some readers, she was eventually assigned a monthly advice column called \\"Ask a Feminist\\". In 1973 she launched Emergency Librarian alongside Phyllis Yaffe. The publication offered a feminist perspective on librarianship, a profession consisting predominantly of women working environments where management roles were overwhelmingly held by men. Covering topics such sexism, the glass ceiling, prison libraries and minority rights, Emergency Librarian was edited by Cheda and Yaffe, CEO of Atlantis Alliance, in Toronto, while Barbara Clubb, future City Librarian for the City of Ottawa, managed subscriptions from her home in Winnipeg. Emergency Librarian was prompted by heightened interest in feminist ideas among members of the Canadian Library Association following a 1973 talk Cheda gave at the association's annual conference. Titled \\"That Special Little Mechanism\\" the talk explored barriers faced by women in the profession \\"as well as suggestions for actions to overcome masculine mystique\\" that she felt \\"is a device that prevents women from full participation in the library world.\\" It served as a response to the conference theme \\"Librarians: beginning, middle and end of career.\\" Cheda and Yaffe continued as editors until 1979 when Ken and Carol-Ann Haycock took over, redirecting the publication's focus to library services for children and young adults. Death and legacy Cheda died from complications due to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) at the age of 72 on June 7, 2008 in The Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto. She was survived by her third husband Karl Jaffary, her children from her first marriage, Marc Perry and Andrew Perry, and his children from his first marriage, Eric Jaffary and Nora Jaffary. She was laid to rest at Mount Pleasant Cemetery. York University offers a scholarship in Cheda's name, aimed at supporting incoming Women's Studies graduate students.

She has been variously known as Sarah Fish, Sarah D. Fish, Sarah David Bills, and Sarah David Bills Fish.  Life  Sarah Fish was born 11 September 1798 in Union, Union County, New Jersey, USA. In 1822, she married Benjamin Fish. Benjamin was a Quaker, as well as an abolitionist. \\"When the Orthodox and Hicksite Quakers split in 1828, primarily over the issue of how actively slavery ought to be opposed, the Fishes joined the Hicksites‚Äîthe more zealously abolitionist sect‚Äîand moved to Rochester.\\" The couple had two daughters: Catherine Ann Fish (later Stebbins) and Mary Fish (later Curtis). Letters suggest the couple were living in Rochester, NY circa 1848 and were involved also in the rise of spiritualism.  Activism  Their family was \\"one of the most prominent early anti-slavery advocate groups.\\" Their home was one of Rochester, New York's first way-stations of the Underground Railroad. The Fish family \\"helped organize everything from abolitionist conventions to antislavery craft fairs.\\" Sarah herself was a member of the Rochester Female Anti-Slavery Society (RFASS), and for a period served as the group's secretary. The RFASS \\"for a few years,\\" \\"dominated women's antislavery activism,\\" but was eventually replaced by a more radical group. In 1842, Sarah joined the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society and, at the urging of Quaker activism Abbey Kelley, served on the executive committee. She was still serving on the executive cocmmitte in 1848, when her husband was president and her son-in-law corresponding secretary. She also wrote for the abolitionist newspaper The North Star. Sarah Fish was also an early activists for women's rights. She participated in the very first Seneca Falls Convention in 1848. Sarah helped organize a second' women's rights convention only weeks later in Rochester, a convention of which her daughter Catherine was a secretary, and on \\"August 2, 1848, Sarah D. Fish delivered an address to the Rochester Woman's Rights Convention\\". Other important attendees included Frederick Douglass. Sarah Fish, Amy Post, and Sarah Hallowell \\"made the historic recommendation that the Rochester Woman's Rights Convention elect a female president.\\" It is reported that \\"This was so radical a step that, amazingly, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, two organizers of the Seneca Falls convention, walked off the platform in protest when Bush took the chair!\\" The Fish family were also apparently involved in working for fairer treatment of Native Americans.  Death and legacy  She died on 7 Nov 1868 at the age of 70 in Rochester, Monroe County, New York, USA. She was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester. Her daughter, Catherine, was also active in women's rights and abolition. Her husband is buried alongside her, and her daughter Catherine and son-in-law are in the adjacent plot.

It featured Don Cherry, and was co-hosted by Dave Hodge from 1982 until 1986, and by Ron MacLean from 1986 to 2019. The popularity of the segment led to Cherry placing seventh in the television show The Greatest Canadian, ahead of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first Prime Minister of Canada, and Wayne Gretzky, considered one of the greatest hockey players. MacLean has referred to the show as \\"six minutes of psychotherapy for athletes\\". The show has also been described as \\"one of the most watched five minutes on Canadian TV\\", and Cherry as an \\"icon of Canadian TV hockey\\". The last airing of the segment was on November 9, 2019, two days before the firing of Cherry from Hockey Night in Canada for comments that suggested Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans but do not wear Remembrance Day poppies. Background Cherry was hired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in 1980 by Ralph Mellanby, executive producer of Hockey Night in Canada (HNIC), to be an analyst for the 1980 Stanley Cup playoffs. He was hired full-time for the following season as a colour commentator, but his habit of cheering for particular teams and his lack of impartiality led to his dismissal from the role; Coach's Corner was created as a result, and was hosted by Dave Hodge and Cherry. Ron MacLean replaced Hodge when was he was hired in 1986. Cherry earned \\"about $1 million\\", negotiating contracts that were less than market value for his services in discussions lasting \\"about 90 seconds\\". Editorial control of the program was the responsibility of MacLaren Advertising and Canadian Sports Network in the 1960s and 1970s, and of Ohlmeyer Communications and Molstar in the 1980s. When Rogers Media acquired control of HNIC following the company's 2013 acquisition of Canadian NHL broadcast rights (from 2014 to 2026), rumours of Cherry's impending dismissal from the broadcast were predicted, but Coach's Corner and both Cherry and MacLean were retained, albeit with a segment reduced from seven minutes to five. During a November 2013 show in the final year of CBC's broadcast, Cherry stated that Rogers Media should not \\"try and ruin a good thing, just leave us alone, and we'll be just as good next year\\". In an interview earlier that week, he had stated that \\"They've been saying that for 30 years...I know I'm No. 1 and Coach's Corner is No. 1 and what are you going to do?\\" During the first few years of Rogers Media control, Cherry and his bosses frequently argued, and during the 2014‚Äì15 NHL season, he had an on-air outburst complaining about the reduction of broadcast time for Coach's Corner. Rogers Media also cut all other appearances by Cherry on HNIC broadcasts, restricting him to Coach's Corner. In a 2017 interview with The New York Times, Cherry stated that other hockey television hosts \\"know all the stats, they know all the players, the whole deal\\" but that he \\"can pick out things no one else picks out\\". Scott Moore, president of Rogers Sportsnet, had stated that he had \\"never met anybody who has a keener eye for the game\\". Broadcast Throughout the week, Cherry and MacLean prepared notes and sent producer Kathy Broderick a list of video clips to prepare for broadcast. Broderick would send them both an email on Friday morning, then MacLean would call Cherry at 9:30 Saturday morning to finalize the list of clips for that night's broadcast. Every Saturday for 33 years, Cherry answered the call with \\"Don's Bicycle Shop, Big Wheel Don talking\\", a gag carried over from his coaching days with the Boston Bruins when Bobby Orr once answered the phone in Cherry's office with \\"Don's Bicycle Shop\\". They spoke for about half an hour. He did not leave his house in the morning. Late each Saturday morning, Cherry concluded a telephone conversation with Broderick with the phrase \\"I'm going to be brilliant as usual\\". Cherry would not eat after 13:00, only drinking coffee, and would take an afternoon nap. At about 17:00, preparations began during story meetings that cover the entirety of the Hockey Night in Canada broadcast, including the pre-game show, Hockey Central Saturday, and Headlines. MacLean and Cherry arrived on the set at about 17:30, and reviewed highlights from the previous week's games. Cherry then sat in his set seat, and the crew adjusted lighting and camera angle for his suit. When the game began, MacLean and Cherry sat in a viewing room alone until the first intermission. Coach's Corner used a set independent from the rest of the HNIC broadcast, which resulted in Cherry never encountering HNIC's hosts and panelists. The set was created because Cherry was uncomfortable with the presence of a full crew and preferred a quiet set and refused an earpiece to receive instructions or notes from the producer. During the broadcast, only Cherry, MacLean, and the camera operator were on the set. Cherry has stated this was because he was not a professional broadcaster and was distracted by the presence of other personnel. Originally, the show featured a discussion of the first period of the game that was airing, followed by highlights of games from the previous week. With the increasing availability of video highlights from numerous online sports resources, such highlights became increasingly stale by the time they would air on Saturday night, so the show shifted its focus to more obscure and specific elements of the game for Cherry to analyse. General and special interest hockey stories were covered on the show. During the final broadcast of the 2017‚Äì18 NHL regular season, Coach's Corner was devoted to the Humboldt Broncos bus crash, which Cherry described as a \\"national nightmare\\". Cherry sometimes preceded his commentary with \\"I'm going to get in trouble for this\\" before making statements that might not be politically correct. Cherry reviewed the segment after it aired, and once again at home, making minor complaints to Broderick about the production. The opening sequence featured Blue, a bull terrier Cherry received as a gift from Boston Bruins players. Cherry's suits A still shot from 22 April 2017 broadcast in which Cherry wore the \\"blood spray\\" suit Cherry has become famous for the suits he wore during Coach's Corner. The suits are tailored at The Coop in northern Toronto, which assumed the role following the death of Cherry's longtime tailor. Cherry selected the material at Fabricland, which was styled at The Coop, then sent to a factory for tailoring. Up to five yards of material were used for each suit to ensure that elements align properly. In April 2017, Toronto Life published an article rating that season's suits \\"from least to most offensive\\". Among them was a jacket he wore for 22 April 2017 broadcast that many likened to bloodspatter. He apologized during an interview the next day, saying that he had read social media postings stating it was symbolic of Cherry \\"murdering the English language\\", and referring to him as Dexter. During an interview on The Morning Show in December 2018, he stated that there were several suits he regretted wearing, but the \\"blood spray\\" suit was the most memorable. Entertainment Tonight Canada published a list of Cherry's most memorable suits in February 2019. During a November 2018 broadcast, Hockey Night in Canada conducted a Retro Jacket auction to raise funds for Hockey Fights Cancer. One of Cherry's blazers was auctioned for $23,550, and one worn by MacLean was auctioned for $17,941. Advocacy Cherry had used the show to promote rule changes. For example, he campaigned for no-touch icing in order to reduce injuries caused as a result of players colliding at the end boards when chasing the puck. When the rule was implemented, he criticized referees who improperly called the rule. He also campaigned for modifications to the protective equipment players wear to make it cause less injuries, rapping a hard plastic elbow pad on the table on air to make his point. He criticized coaches for in-game replacement of a goalie performing poorly, instead of doing so during an intermission. He often targeted his messages to children, and proposed changes to children's hockey, such as requiring children's hockey leagues to use smaller pucks instead of those used by adults. He stated that young children have trouble handling the NHL regulation-sized pucks. On the show, he may preface comments to children with \\"You kids\\" or \\"You young kids\\"; for example, in a November 2014 show, he stated \\"I'm going to show you kids, you young goalies, how to act and how not to act\\" in a segment showing clips of NHL goalies. During the first intermission of game 2 of the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals between the Washington Capitals and Vegas Golden Knights, MacLean invited NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, who was standing nearby, to participate in the segment. Cherry had stated that the league should expand to Quebec City, and that there has never been another rivalry in any sport like that between the Montreal Canadiens and the Quebec Nordiques. Bettman stated that Cherry's \\"popularity just went up in Quebec\\". Criticism Cherry's strong opinions at times led to repercussions, including several attempts by the CBC to fire him. In the early 1980s, as a result of his inability to pronounce names and for \\"butchering the language\\", CBC executives were prepared to fire him but refrained when Mellanby told them he would quit if Cherry was fired. Columnists have referred to him as a troglodyte and a misogynist for the views he expresses on the show. In 2004, the CBC tested running Coach's Corner on a seven-second delay after he made \\"inappropriate and reprehensible personal\\" statements on 24 January 2004 broadcast. He has stated that National Hockey League rule changes to limit fighting in the game, particularly the instigator rule, were made because \\"nerds don't want fighting\\" and that the lack of protection by enforcers of star players is why there is an increasing prevalence of injuries to the latter, and wanted enforcers in the game so that star players such as Connor McDavid would not have to fight. The segment was also criticized for being a dominant presence on Hockey Night in Canada, and for focusing primarily on issues of interest to Cherry. He often used Coach's Corner to express some of his right-wing conservative views and Canadian nationalism and paid tribute to Canadian law enforcement and the military. He has also endorsed conservative political candidates, and has made many references to \\"left-wing pinkos\\". In 2003, the hosts devoted an entire show to discussing the federal government's decision to refrain from participating in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the Iraq War led by the United States. The annual broadcast preceding or on Remembrance Day included a video clip of Cherry walking in a \\"war cemetery in France that's full of Canadian soldiers\\". Pat Hickey, writing for the Montreal Gazette in 2014, stated that Coach's Corner is not the appropriate forum to honour the military or to discuss politics. In a February 2018 broadcast, Cherry stated that people who believe climate change are \\"cuckaloos\\", eliciting a response from Catherine McKenna, the federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change. In a broadcast in 2008, he had referred to environmentalist David Suzuki as a \\"left-wing kook\\". Some of his proclamations on the show have been criticized for insulting Quebecois and European players, some of whom he has regarded as \\"soft\\". He has stated that Americans are ruining the NHL. In a 2011 article in Maisonneuve, Mike Spry stated that Coach's Corner is \\"a caricature of sports commentary\\", describing it as a comedy and parody that is better suited to Saturday Night Live. He also called for Cherry and MacLean to be fired. In a 2014 article for Postmedia News, Scott Stinson stated that the segment is \\"tinged with xenophobia\\".  Cherry's removal from Hockey Night in Canada and the end of Coach's Corner  On 9 November 2019, Cherry made remarks during Coach's Corner suggesting that Canadian people benefit from the sacrifices of veterans and do not wear remembrance poppies. He remarked, \\"You people that come here... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that... These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price.\\" Sportsnet apologized for the remarks, stating that his comments were discriminatory and offensive, and that they \\"do not represent our values and what we stand for as a network.\\" His co-host, Ron MacLean also apologized via Twitter, expressing regret for his actions and for allowing Cherry make the comments. The NHL also released a statement on Cherry's comments saying \\"the comments made last night were offensive and contrary to the values we believe in.\\" Cherry later told the Toronto Sun that he would not apologize for his comments stating \\"I have had my say\\". The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) stated that its internal systems had been overloaded by a high number of complaints. Two days later, on 11 November, Remembrance Day, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that \\"following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night's broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down\\". Speaking to the Toronto Sun, Cherry commented \\"I know what I said and I meant it. Everybody in Canada should wear a poppy to honour our fallen soldiers... I would have liked to continue doing Coach's Corner. The problem is if I have to watch everything I say, it isn't Coach's Corner\\". He later said that if he had to do it again, he would have said \\"everybody\\". On 16 November 2019, MacLean addressed and reflected on the incident during Hockey Night in Canada, the first without Cherry, also announcing that Coach's Corner is no more. Following the firing of Cherry, Numeris figures showed a slumping in the viewership of Hockey Night in Canada. When the NHL season opened in October, the first Saturday night game featuring the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens drew an average audience of 1.247 million. Cherry's last broadcast on 9 November, a game that featured the Maple Leafs playing the Philadelphia Flyers, drew an average audience of 1.027 million; in the two weeks following Cherry's dismissal the eastern broadcast of Hockey Night in Canada failed to make the Numeris Top 30 ranked TV shows. On 13 December, the main game drew an average audience of 810,000 compared to 983,000 for the same weekend in 2018. Awards Coach's Corner was nominated for a Best Sports Program or Series for the 22nd Gemini Awards in 2007. In popular culture The album Supporting Caste by the Canadian punk rock band Propagandhi includes the song \\"Dear Coach's Corner\\", in which the singer directs questions to MacLean, asking why his niece should be subjected to requests to adhere to a collective will. It also refers to Cherry's ideology as \\"A strange and bitter fruit, that sad old man beside you keeps feeding to young minds as virtue\\". The show and its hosts have been parodied a number of times, including by This Hour Has 22 Minutes and the Twitter account DonCherryParody. A review of the weekly show was printed in the Toronto Sun in a segment named Cherry Pickin'. In November 2015, Cherry and MacLean were inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. They unveiled their star on King Street West of Toronto's Entertainment District in July 2016.

It is native to the tropical and subtropical New World and has expanded its range into the eastern United States, where it lives in piles of sawdust, whereas in the hotter part of its range it lives under the bark of decomposing logs. It was named after the American entomologist Henry Guernsey Hubbard, who discovered the insect in the United States. Description Adults are about in length and have nine segments in their antennae, while nymphs have eight. Adults have winged forms with eyes, and females occur in blind, wingless forms. The wings, when present, are membranous and paddle-shaped, the fore wings being larger than the hind wings. The hind legs have distinctive stiff spines on the underside of the femurs. The abdomen has eleven segments, with a pair of short cerci at the tip. Nymphs are white, gradually changing to brownish as they grow. Distribution and habitat Originally a tropical and subtropical species in Central and South America, Zorotypus hubbardi has expanded its range northwards into the United States. This has probably occurred through the movement of winged females, possibly overwintering in piles of sawdust. Its normal habitat is under the loose bark of decomposing logs. Along with Zorotypus snyderi from southern Florida, Hubbard's angel insect is one of only two members of this order to be found in the United States, the rest of the order being largely tropical in distribution. Hubbard's angel insect has been detected in Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. Ecology Hubbard's angel insects are gregarious and are usually found under bark in small groups. They feed on fungal spores and hyphae, and scavenge for dead mites, nematodes and other small invertebrates. They often groom themselves or each other, using their mouthparts to clean their own antennae, legs and hind part of the abdomen, while other individuals clean the thorax and front of the abdomen. This allogrooming may be important to help avoid the fungal attacks that kill many zorapterans. On being disturbed by removal of the bark, the insects scuttle rapidly away to hide in crevices. The small pale insects may be confused with termites, but move much faster. When conditions are suitable for the insects, only wingless females are present, which breed by parthenogenesis. Batches of eggs are concealed under chewed food particles and guarded by the mother. The eggs hatch after a few weeks and the nymphs moult four or five times as they grow. Under adverse conditions, such as when the insects become overcrowded or run out of food, the females lay eggs that hatch into nymphs that develop into winged males and winged females. These fly off in due course to search for more suitable places to colonise. On arrival, they shed their wings and mate repeatedly. During courtship, the males offer the females droplets of a liquid secreted by glands on their heads.

It occurs in shallow coastal waters in the western Atlantic Ocean. It is the type species of the genus Entomacrodus. Description Pearl blennies are pale in colour marked with dark brown bands and have extremely bright white spots along the length of theor whole bodies. They have a blunt head and a high forehead with two moderately-sized eyes. They have filaments over the eyes and on the nape which are called cirri. When breeding the male's cirri and dorsal fins become enlarged. They have slender, sharp teeth, resembling combs, in their jaws. There are 13 spines and 14-15 soft rays in the dorsal fin while the anal fin has 2 spines and 16 rays. This species may attain a Total Length of . The flattened eyes are thought to be an adaptation for seeing in air. Distribution The pearl blenny is found in the western central Atlantic where its distributions stretches from Bermuda to southeastern Florida, west to the Gulf of Mexico where it ranges from the Florida Keys to Campeche, Mexico, and south through the Caribbean Sea. Habitat and ecology The pearl blenny prefers shallow waters and they are normally recorded close to the surface, as well as in tidal pools or rocks pools. The smaller individuals stay lower down in the water column so that they can avoid harsher conditions. They are largely diurnal feeders, mainly feeding on algae. They can survive on land but prefer to remain in water. Their flattish eye gives then a vision something like that of a bird. They are able to survive out of water in shade for around 2.5 hours which extends to 3.5 hours during the night but only 7 minutes in direct sunlight. The males choose small crevices or empty shells which they clean out and the female will spawn into these. The eggs have an adhesive pad with which they stick to the internal surface of the nest. The males guard the eggs and often fan them until they have hatched.

Its development occurred during the second half of the 19th century and today it displays several buildings listed on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage list, with a variety of architectural styles, from eclectic to early modernist. The area also nurtured a series of local successful factories, under the Prussian and the Polish periods. Location The street is located on an area between the Brda river and the Bydgoszcz Canal, laid on an ESE-WNW axis. It starts from the river bank and crosses a handful of other streets, among which Kr√≥lowej Jadwigi Street. History The plot of land where the street lies was called canalswerder () in the 19th century, as mentioned on an 1857 Prussian map of Bromberg. Canalswerder area on an 1857 map Indeed, the area was delimited by the Brda river bed on the north and the Bydgoszcz Canal on the south. Nowadays, the sector is even cut off in the north-west by a second section of the Bydgoszcz canal, built in the early 20th century. The street is mentioned as early as the mid-19th century, as the address of the successful Buchholz tannery. The rest of the building plots have been completed at the turn of the 20th century. The street bore only two names through time: * 19th century - 1920 and during German occupation, Alfred stra√üe; * 1920 - 1939 and since 1945, Ulica Garbary. The current appellation Garbary refers to the (Buchholz ) tannery, called garbarnia in Polish.

He did not live there, preferring his house at Danzigerstra√üe 61 (Gda≈Ñska Street 107, building is gone). The house features picturesque settings, with medieval references. Material is a mix of brick and plaster, with a particular notice to the facade on Kr√≥lowej Jadwigi Street, where several architectural pieces are to be underlined. The corner is highlighted by a tall bay window adorned with gothic-shaped windows, oeil-de-boeuf and stuccoed motifs, topped by an octagonal tower capped by a crenellated conical roof. The frontage onto Jadwigi Street possesses another grand bay window with the same gothic-medieval allusions (e.g. the crow-stepped gable). In addition, the highest part displays in a medallion a figure of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko (by Piotr Triebler); above the medallion, a statue of Queen Jadwiga stands in a niche, towering the whole street that bears her name.

Although most of it is underground, the creek does surface in several locations. It has two branches, the Rockridge Branch and the Broadway Branch.  Watershed and geography  Glen Echo Creek is part of the 2.6-square-mile Glen Echo Creek Watershed and drains parts of Upper Rockridge, Piedmont Avenue, and Piedmont. Both the main creek and its Rockridge Branch start in the Oakland Hills around the Rock Ridge outcroppings. Glen Echo Creek runs past the Mountain View Cemetery, then through the Piedmont Avenue neighborhood, where it surfaces for a stretch that includes the Glen Echo Creek Park pocket park. After continuing underground in a culvert, it again surfaces at Oak Glen Park along Richmond Boulevard between Westfall Avenue and Randwick Avenue. From there, it continues mostly underground to Lake Merritt. The Rockridge Branch flows from the hills to a pond near Pleasant Valley Avenue and then continues as the Broadway Branch. It surfaces briefly near 38th Street and Manila Avenue before continuing under Mosswood Park and eventually joining the main creek near Lake Merritt.  History  In 1905, inspired by the City Beautiful Movement, developers Frank and Wickham Havers purchased and protected the Oak Glen Park area, which contains a 1,500-feet section of the creek surrounded by live oaks. A stone bridge and pergola were added in 1911, but have fallen into disrepair. Piedmont Avenue residents first worked to protect Glen Echo Creek in 1976, when the Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District proposed to pave over and redevelop the open-air section of creek that would later become Glen Echo Creek Park. In 1984, the creek was damaged by bulldozers deployed by the flood control district. A woman lay in front of the bulldozers, stopping them, and she was then able to garner support from neighborhood groups to successfully oppose the project. The flood control district then had to repair the damage. The section of creek was stabilized and restored, and replanted with native riparian plants and redwood, maple, and alder trees. By 2001, this section of the creek was again in disrepair, and was again restored by Oakland in 2002. In 2015, the East Bay Municipal Utility District accidentally spilled 140 cubic yards of cement into the creek in Upper Rockridge.

The founders were George Fowler, Alexander Dick and Gilbert Walker. They had previous employment experience in the dry goods business in Connecticut. The first store opened for business on April 5, 1879. By December, they were advertising in other nearby towns, and by February had 18 employees. In 1882, they opened a Binghamton, New York branch.

The main Wilkes-Barre store was severely damaged in the Hurricane Agnes flood in 1972 while at the same time Wilkes-Barre‚Äôs Wyoming Valley Mall opened. A branch store was opened in the Laurel Mall in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, which Fowler, Dick and Walker also developed. The combination of the slowdown at the main Wilkes-Barre store and the expense of opening the new store which started off slowly, proved too much. Fowler, Dick and Walker celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1979 and then was sold first to a local entrepreneur and then to Boscov's.

It highlights the intersections of antisemitism and ableism in World War II era Switzerland.  Biography  Liselotte Rosenberg was born in Giessen, Germany on 15 September 1923 to Clara and Siegfried Rosenberg a couple of Jewish apple wine producers and merchants who lived and worked in the nearby town of Usingen. As an infant she contracted bone tuberculosis and at the age of 3 her family sent her to a sanatorium in the French-speaking village of Leysin in the Swiss Alps, where Auguste Rollier had developed a therapy based on sunlight treatment. After Liselotte's family became unable to pay for her medical expenses in Switzerland due to restrictions on Jews being able to transfer funds abroad, Dr Rollier allowed for her to remain in the sanatorium. After her recovery she worked there as a nursing assistant before moving in 1945 to Zurich to train as a social worker. Liselotte Rosenberg (centre) working as a nursing assistant in Leysin, c. 1940. When Liselotte last visited her parents in Usingen in 1937, she became aware that Nazism had a strong following in the area after suffering anti-Semitic abuse. She was sent back to Switzerland and soon after her parents fled to Frankfurt, Germany before taking refuge in the United States in 1941. Liselotte remained in Switzerland until she joined her family in the United States in 1946. Switzerland held a profound importance in her life and became the setting for her novel Tongue-Tied. In New York she attended Hunter College. In the immediate post-war years, the college waived many of the normal entry requirements and attracted a large number of European refugees who had missed out on formal education. It was there that she first met Ruth Kl√ºger, a Holocaust survivor whose memoir Still Alive discusses Hunter and the start of what would be her lifelong friendship with Liselotte. After graduating, she earned a master's degree in comparative literature from Yale. While at Yale, she met her future husband Peter Marshall, a British history doctoral student. Peter and Liselotte moved to England in 1953, married, and had two children Eleanor and Oliver in Bristol where Peter worked at the university. The family moved often; from Bristol to California and back to Montreal, and finally to Manchester. When her husband Peter retired, they moved to Whaley Bridge (in Derbyshire), and finally to London. Among other things, Liselotte felt comfortable with her official status of being stateless since she disliked the idea of nationality. Her husband Peter died in 2008, Liselotte lived for 9 more years until her death in 2017. She was survived by her children Eleanor and Oliver, and her grandchildren Jessica, Sam, Anneliese, and George.  Tongue-Tied  Highlighting the intersections of antisemitism and ableism, Tongue-Tied is a novel written by Liselotte Marshall about a New York-based interpreter, Rachel. Upon losing her ability to speak, Rachel is overcome by a past of painful memories that contributes to the breakdown of her marriage and a series of reflections on her family and upbringing as a stateless person. The themes of the novel highlight Marshall's own experiences as a refugee in Switzerland where she battled bone tuberculosis and struggled against her experiences with antisemitism. Marshall began drafting the novel in 1970 in English, but she took a hiatus due to the intensity of emotions she experienced while writing. She finished Tongue-Tied in 1991. However, the novel was originally published in German in 1997, followed by French in 2000, and then in 2004 in English, its original language. Marshall said of Tongue-Tied that she hoped to erase the pain of her childhood. She wanted to tell her story, and highlight a child's life in a sanatorium in Leysin. On why Marshall chose to write a novel, she states that a novel allowed her to express things she would not feel safe expressing in an autobiography. She feared backlash for her critical portrayal of Swiss society in the 1930s and 1940s.

Stratfield Saye House Pitt was born after 1691, the eldest son of George Pitt of Strathfieldsaye, Hampshire, and his first wife Lucy Pile, daughter of Thomas Pile of Baverstock, Wiltshire. and Shroton, Dorset. By 1721, he had married Mary Louisa Bernier, daughter of John Bernier of Strasburg, in Alsace. His mother had died on 17 November 1697 and in 1714 he succeeded to the Dorset estates of his maternal grandfather. Pitt was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Wareham on his family interest at a by-election on 18 April 1715 after his father, elected at the 1715 British general election, chose to sit for Hampshire instead. Like his father, he refused to sign the loyal association in December 1715. He voted against the septennial bill in 1716, but was absent from the divisions on the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts and the Peerage Bill in 1719. At the 1722 British general election, he lost his seat at Wareham. He appears to have changed sides as he defeated the Tory, Thomas Horner, at a by-election for Dorset on 25 January 1727, with the help of Bubb Dodington, who described him as ‚Äòscarcely capable‚Äô. Before the 1727 later in the year, Richard Edgcumbe reported to Walpole that Pitt had changed sides again and Pitt did not stand at the election.

Biography  Ruytchi Souzouki was introduced to painting by Sanzo Wada (1883‚Äì1967), a well-known artist in Japan. His banker father moved to Brazil in the 1920s and the young Ruytchi continued his artistic training at the School of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro. The poet Paul Fort, visiting Brazil, became interested in the creative intensity of the young man and convinced him to settle in Paris in the early 1920s. Souzouki met the world of Japanese artists living in Paris in the Montparnasse of the Roaring Twenties. He became close to Tsuguharu Foujita, who made a portrait of Souzouki and introduced him to the patron Jirohachi Satsuma (1901‚Äì1976). In 1922, Souzouki presented his first solo exhibition at the Galerie Manuel Fr√®res in Paris, with a catalog prefaced by the art critic Andr√© Salmon. Starting from 1923, he exhibited regularly at the Salons d'Automne, the Salon des ind√©pendants and the Tuileries. In particular at the Salon des ind√©pendants, he presented Dames √† la Terrasse in 1928 and, Piano et Chant. in 1930. In 1936, Foujita had one of Souzouki's paintings acquired by the National Gallery in Prague. His pictorial approach became increasingly influenced by the various currents of the figurative avant-garde. He became associated with the painters of the School of Paris and connected with Jules Pascin and Max Ernst. His research on the expression of the psyche led him to adhere to the surrealist approach, which became pivotal for all his work, leading him to become interested in automatic drawing and collage. He received the prize of the Japanese Embassy in Paris in 1939. After the Second World War, he further made himself known with works at the Salon d'Automne, the Salon des Tuileries and the Salon des Ind√©pendants. His fame thrived and in 1954, he exhibited surrealist collages at the Galerie Paul Petrides and the Galerie Romanet. Respectively in 1969 and 1971, he presented L'invitation par la D√©esse Shakti and Poids de la modestie at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. He published articles in the magazine Bizarre. The originality of his artistic expression laid in the integration of popular elements (press, soap operas, crime novel), from which he made portrait collages of Martine Carol, Brigitte Bardot and Marcel Proust, with an Arcimboldo influence. The editor Eric Losfeld, published a collection of his drawings devoted to Brigitte Bardot (1960, prefaced by Jacques Sternberg). Gradually, he became estranged to the world and continued his research alone in his workshop, rue Mouton-Duvernet. He played a Japanese tourist in The Holes a film by Pierre Tchernia in 1973 and received the City of Paris Silver Medal in 1980. He died poor and forgotten, in 1985 and is buried in the mass grave of the Cimeti√®re parisien de Thiais. His work, recovered by his janitor, was auctioned at the H√¥tel Drouot Auction House in March 1986, the unsold being dumped. He was gradually rediscovered in the 2000s. The Galerie Vallois (Paris, New York) devoted an exhibition, organized by Henri Enu. Some of his works are sold in public markets. The painter Albert Mescam became aware of his drawings which he published a book about at the √âditions de L‚ÄôUsine Souzouki, les dessins de 1935. The gallerist Fran√ßois Deneulin revisited his work with an exhibition in 2016 and a website. Ruychi Souzouki is sometimes mistaken with Ryozo Souzouki (1898‚Äì1958), a contemporary Japanese painter who also lived in France. Some of Ruychi Souzouki's paintings have been attributed to Ryozo.

Career Brownlee was born to father Os Brownlee, a founding member of Australian Canoeing. With his paddling experience, he helped raise and train her in competitive canoeing. With her father's help, Brownlee trained on the Parramatta River in the K1 and K2 classes but shortly thereafter switched to canoe slalom. Brownlee won Australia‚Äôs first international slalom medal; however, because Australian Canoeing focused mostly on sprint canoeing, she was unable to compete in the 1972 Summer Olympics. As a result, Brownlee served as a judge for both the 1972 and 1988 Summer Olympic Games and later was a member of the competition jury at the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games.

A second, very similar but single seat design, the Rubik R-16 Lepke, provided follow-up solo experience of the same techniques. Pairs were widely used by Hungarian glider clubs post-war, with 65 of each produced. Design and development In 1940 Ern≈ë Rubik began to consider a glider flight training programme based on a pair of aircraft with similar flight characteristics and sharing many components but differing in their seating. Students would begin on the R-15 Koma, with side-by-side seating and the reassurance and guidance of a tutor watching, then go solo on the R-16 Lepke. During the war, the Hungarian National Aviation Association (Orsz√°gos Magyar Rep√ºl√∂ Egyes√ºlet or OMRE) chose to use his R-11 Cimbora and the Koma and Lepke designs were shelved until, in 1948, OMRE announced a competition for single seat and two seat trainers. By the end of the year Rubik's two designs had been chosen. The prototype Koma first flew in April 1949, followed by the Lepke in the summer. The Koma was a pod-and-boom glider with a cantilever, mid-mounted wing which was rectangular in plan out to rounded tips and had 3¬∞ of dihedral. The wing was built around a single, wooden spar with wooden ribs; ply covering ahead of the spar formed a torsion-resistant D-box. The rest of the wing was fabric-covered. Diagonal drag struts near the root were made from steel tubes. Constant chord flaps and Handley Page slotted ailerons together filled the whole trailing edge, mounted on a light-metal tube false spar and fabric-covered. Flap settings were 5¬∞ for launching and 60¬∞ for landing. The wings could be folded back alongside the fuselage for transport. The forward pod was built around two plywood, semi- circular, transverse frames mounted parallel to each other under the wing on a box-section beam which projected forward to the nose. This carried the two side-by-side seats, provided with dual controls, in an enclosed cockpit under a generously glazed, centrally hinged two-part canopy. It also mounted, on its underside, a semi-recessed monowheel, placed under the trailing edge on production aircraft (it was further forward on the prototype) with a short, rubber sprung landing skid ahead of it. From the aft of the beam a metal tube strut reached upwards and rearwards to support the boom that formed the rear fuselage. This tube was enclosed within the pod, which had ply-covered lower surfaces but was fabric-covered above. The upward sloping tailboom was a rectangular section, wooden, ply-covered structure mounted on the centre of the rear semi-circular frame, braced with wires from the inner wings as well as the metal tube from the lower fuselage. All Komas had a conventional tail and the production R-15b had a large, blunted triangular fin and rounded under-fin incorporating a small tailskid and carrying a roughly triangular, deep rudder. Its strut-braced tailplane was rectangular in plan with rounded tips and carried rounded elevators, centrally cut-away for rudder movement. The prototype R-15 Koma first flew in April 1949. Flight trials revealed lateral instability when towed and so the single R-15a had a lengthened fuselage with a fin with its area increased by sweeping its previously upright leading edge forward, introducing the underfin and lowering the tailplane to the top of the fuselage. Its trials showed average students needed landing speeds reduced and so flaps were added to the R-15b Koma, first flown in June 1950, which went into series production. Sixty-five were built between 1950-1, becoming the standard Hungarian, dual control, winch-launch trainer. It remained in operation well into the 1960s. In 1957 Sport√°rutermel≈ë V√°llalat designers J√≥zsef Mih√°ly, Lajos B√°nv√∂lgyi, Lajos Bende and Ferenc Major developed a light metal version of the Koma, the R-15F F√©m-Koma (Metal-Koma), which flew in June 1958. The R-15F was very similar to the R-15b externally but there were some differences. The latter's rounded tips had been squared off, reducing the span by and it was longer. The cockpit canopy opened forward on a transverse hinge. The horizontal tail was also squared off and the fin had a narrow, rectangular profile. The R-15F was also about 11% heavier. Performances were close though the metal version had a higher VNE and a slightly better glide ratio at a higher speed. By June 1964 the sole F√©m-Koma had made 6275 launches and flown for 520 hours.

He wrote articles for the journal as well as editing it, and published five books on the Australian Army's campaigns in the First and Second World Wars, and one on the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862 in the American Civil War. The Army decided that this would be the subject of examination in 1952, and as there were few sources available, Keogh wrote one. Interest was low, and only the last book, South West Pacific, 1941-1945 attracted a mainstream commercial publisher. In retirement, Keogh was the technical advisor to the television series, The Sullivans, about the experiences of an Australian family during and immediately after the Second World War. He died on 9 November 1981. In 2014, the E.G. Keogh Visiting Chair was named in his memory.

Sankoff was born in North York, Ontario, and double-majored in psychology and creative writing at York University, where she met Hein. After graduating, the couple moved to New York City in 1999 where he worked at a music studio and she studied at The Actor's Studio and performed in theatres. They were in New York City during the September 11 attacks. After spending several years studying and working in New York the couple returned to Toronto where Hein wrote a song, \\"My Mother's Lesbian Jewish Wiccan Wedding\\", about his mother and her later life partner. Sankoff and Hein expanded the song into a play that became a hit at the Toronto Fringe Festival in 2009 and then picked up by Mirvish Productions for a run at Toronto's Panasonic Theatre before touring Canada. As a result of My Mother‚Äôs Lesbian Jewish Wiccan Wedding success, theatre producer Michael Rubinoff approached Hein and Sankoff with his idea about a show based on Operation Yellow Ribbon in which residents of Gander, Newfoundland, housed 7,000 airline passengers who had been stranded at Gander Airport as a result of the grounding of all North American air flights following the September 11 attacks. The couple visited Gander in 2011 during the 10-year reunion of passengers and locals, and subsequently wrote Come from Away based on the stories they learned there.\\"From Gander to Broadway\\" .

Candidates Within days of the vacancy arising as a result of Cawdor's death and the elevation of his son and heir to the House of Lords, George Lort Phillips of Lawrenny had issued an address declaring himself as the Conservative candidate, with the support of his predecessor. The local Conservative newspaper, the Pembrokeshire Herald, strongly endorsed his candidacy.

However, he was opposed by a Liberal candidate, Hugh Owen Owen, son of the Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire and previously MP for Pemnroke Boroughs. In contrast to its strong support for Lort Phillips, the Herald referred to Owen's long absence from the county, his age (although he was only in his mid 50s), his abandonment of his previous Conservative views, the attitude of his father and his record years before as member for the Pembroke Boroughs. Although the Pembrokeshire Herald railed against \\"the evils\\" of a contested election the scene was set for a bitter contest.

Baghdad was founded in 762 by the second Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur (). The main part of the original city was the Round City, with the Palace of the Golden Gate and the adjacent Great Mosque of al- Mansur at its centre. Apart from the mosque, no other buildings were allowed to be built close to the palace, which was thus surrounded by a wide space; only on the northwest, towards the Gate of Syria, two buildings were constructed next to the palace wall: a barracks for the Caliph's horse guard, and a two-part gallery, originally intended as an audience hall for the sahib al-shurta and the captain of the horse guard respectively, but later came to be used as a public prayer space. Around this wide open space, the palaces of al-Mansur's younger children, quarters for the palace servants, and the offices of the various administrative departments were built. The palace originally occupied an area of , with a central building topped by a green dome, high, which gave the palace its alternative name of al-Qubbat al- Kha·∏çrƒÅ æ. At the top of the dome was the effigy of a horseman carrying a lance, who in later times was credited with magical properties: he would allegedly turn his lance towards the direction where enemies were approaching from. Underneath the dome was a square audience chamber , with a vaulted ceiling just as high; and above that, in the interior of the dome, was another chamber of similar dimensions. In front of the audience chamber was an alcove, called the aywan, which was surmounted by an arch high and wide. The palace and mosque appear to have been completed in 763, one year after construction began, allowing al-Mansur to take up residence in the city. While the Palace of the Golden Gate remained the official residence of the caliphs, al-Mansur and his successors also spent much time in the nearby Khuld Palace constructed soon afterwards. Harun al-Rashid () is said to have particularly preferred Khuld over the older palace, but his son al-Amin () restored it as his residence, added a new wing to it, as well as a large square (maydan). As the main stronghold of al-Amin and his partisans, it suffered extensive damage from bombardment by catapult during the Siege of Baghdad (812‚Äì813). The palace then ceased to be used as a royal residence, and became neglected. The palace remained standing, however; part of the structure was torn down to facilitate the expansion of the nearby Great Mosque under al-Mu'tadid (), but the landmark Green Dome remained standing until the night of 9 March 941 (7/8 Jumada II 329 AH), when heavy rainfalls, and possibly a thunderbolt strike, led to the collapse of the dome. The walls of the dome survived until the Sack of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258.

He also played in Ireland for Bohemians, and managed Dundalk to the 1932‚Äì33 League of Ireland title. Life and career Wright was born in Leicester in 1893. He played representative football for Leicester Schools, alongside future Bolton team-mate and Scotland international Alex Donaldson. He went on to play for Leicester-based club Belvoir Street Sunday School, where he succeeded future England international Tommy Clay as team captain after Clay signed for Leicester Fosse. During the First World War, Wright served with the Leicestershire Regiment and the Royal Army Medical Corps. For a time he was stationed in Ireland, where he played for Dublin club Bohemians and was picked to play in an amateur international against England, the selectors believing him to be an Irishman; he did not accept the invitation. After the war, amid interest from \\"several first-class clubs\\", Wright signed for Bolton Wanderers of the Football League First Division. He spent something over two seasons with the club, as backup for Jimmy Seddon, and played 10 first-team matches, all in the league, before moving on to Norwich City of the Third Division South in July 1922 for a ¬£750 fee. Until then he had played as a centre half, \\"[making] up for his lack of height by his cleverness\\"he stood but he was a regular for Norwich on the left of the half-back line. Wright saw his future in management, but after failing to get the player-manager vacancy at Chatham Town, he attempted to continue his playing career with another Third Division club, Brighton & Hove Albion, in 1923‚Äì24. He made just four appearances before a broken leg forced his retirement at the end of the season. Wright returned to Ireland in 1930 as trainer-coacheffectively, managerof Dundalk. He was later to describe the role as \\"doing everything except selling the programmes\\". He led the club to runners-up spots in both league and Cup in his first season, and his team then won the President's Cup by a wide margin. In his third season, Dundalk became the first team based outside the capital to win the league title. After four years with Dundalk, Wright went back to England to take up the post of trainer to Lincoln City Lincoln finished in the top four of the Third Division North three times in the four seasons that Wright trained them, and according to the Lincolnshire Echo, he \\"proved a popular and efficient trainer, and tributes to the fit condition of the players have been paid on many of the grounds on which City have appeared.\\" He joined Ipswich Town, newly elected to the Football League, as trainer in July 1938, but left them again soon afterwards. The following year, Wright was recommended by Stanley Rous, secretary of the Football Association, to their Norwegian counterparts for a three-month appointment as trainer-coach of SK Strong's football department and technical adviser to other teams in Oslo and elsewhere. Wright's son, Geoff, played league football for Walsall in the 1950s. Wright died in his native Leicester in 1959 at the age of 66.

Its members, mostly Sturmabteilung (SA), were trained in military camps in Bavaria, then armed in preparation for a potential invasion of Austria. Operating from 1933 to 1938, the Legion proved mostly ineffective and in some cases detrimental to Germany's interests in Austria. Formation Following the deportation of Theodor Habicht from Austria in 1932, Habicht moved his headquarters into Bavaria, to continue organized Nazi activities in Austria. On 19 June 1933, the government of Engelbert Dollfuss banned the Nazi Party in Austria. About 10,000 Nazis fled from arrest to Bavaria, where Habicht organized them into the Austrian Legion, based at Dachau. Joined by more emigres following the failed 1934 July Putsch, they soon numbered over 15,000. In Bavaria, the expatriates received military training from the Sturmabteilung (SA), Schutzstaffel (SS), and German Army and police. They were also given arms ‚Äì 10,300 rifles and 360 machine guns. The Austrian Legion was officially part of SA-Obergruppe VIII, designated for Austria. The Legion was used in practice to cause concern in the Vienna government of military action from Bavaria and to smuggle Nazi propaganda into Austria. At this time, the Legion numbered over 14,000 and possessed over 1,500 motorcars and could reach the Austrian border in 24 hours. The threat the Legion posed was minimized, however, when the Legion was ordered to surrender its arms to the Wehrmacht following the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler's purge of the SA. Anschluss and disbanding When the Anschluss came in March 1938, the Legion was blocked from participating by Josef B√ºrckel, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, and Heinrich Himmler. The Legion paraded through Vienna on 2 April, and was totally disbanded two weeks later. Most of its members returned to Germany, while those who remained in Austria faced poor job prospects. Impact In spite of the massive amount of support given them by Berlin, in 1935 receiving 24 million Reichsmark, the Austrian Legion had mixed success. Its members were often an object of ire for German and Austrian Germans for their lack of discipline in their violent and ill-advised agitation, especially against the Catholic Church. The Legion's activities, which amounted to state-sponsored terrorism in another sovereign state, also angered Benito Mussolini. The Vienna government began to worry less about the Legion following its disarmament, and from intercepted communiques that revealed that their fighting power had been overstated. Geopolitical consequences Mussolini assured the Dollfuss government in August 1933 that, in the event of any attack from Germany by the German government or the Austrian Legion, Italy would come to Austria's aid. Dollfuss, in response, agreed to a military convention with Italy.

Development and design The aircraft was developed under a program initiated by the French Navy in March 1937 to replace the aging Loire 130 floatplane. Had it entered service, the fast battleship was to have carried three of the aircraft. The program requested an aircraft that had an endurance of six hours and be able to carry a bomb load. The endurance requirement was later reduced to five hours to save weight. The NC.420 was a twin-engine aircraft, an uncommon arrangement for ship-borne reconnaissance aircraft where a premium was placed on compactness. It could nevertheless be reduced to a width of with the wings folded, which made it comparable in size (and weight) to the Loire 130 it was slated to have replaced. Work on the prototype was nearing completion in June 1940, but the German victory in the Battle of France ended many French military programs, including that for the NC.420. The German Armistice Commission approved the construction of up to fifteen aircraft to replace Loire 130s that were damaged or destroyed through normal operation, but work thereafter proceeded slowly and the prototype was only completed in mid-1943. Italian occupation forces thereafter disabled the aircraft's controls so it could not be flown to join Free French Forces in North Africa.

The allegations rested upon several servicemen, although seven were sent to trial at the Old Bailey in London. Two were from the Royal Signals Regiment, and five from the Royal Air Force, with all being accused of engaging in homosexual activitiesAt the time, homosexuality was not allowed in the UK Armed Forces. and passing state secrets \\"by the bagful\\" to the Soviet intelligence network. The treatment of the accused whilst detained before trial was deemed unlawful and after a trial at the Old Bailey in 1985, in which they were acquitted, six of the servicemen were allowed to sue the Ministry of Defence for their mistreatment. At the time, it was the longest spy trial go through the British court system. It was also known as the Mata Hari Cyprus Spy Ring due to the involvement of a female conspirator despite the allegations of homosexuality. Background The Ministry of Defence, and other NATO partners, have had listening stations on Cyprus since the 1960s when the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia were established, however, other sites, such as Ayios Nikolaos Station have been in existence since the 1940s. The bases at Cyprus provide valuable SIGINT (signals intelligence) from the Middle-East and the Caucasus region which is fed into the GCHQ system. Cyprus has also been dubbed The Spy Capital of the World; its location at the corner of the Middle-East has meant its strategic importance is recognised by all sides. One book written about espionage in the Middle- East describes Cyprus as \\"bristling with radar and electronic intelligence hardware that made it a major military prize for the superpowers\\". At the time of the supposed spy-ring, over 4,000 British service personnel were stationed there and the US Air Force regularly undertook reconnaissance missions from the island. The SIGINT (and to an extent, ELINT [electronic intelligence]) stations on the island of Cyprus were the settings for some show trials throughout the 1970s and 80s. In 1978, the ABC trial was tried at the Old Bailey; this case revolved around a former corporal, John Berry, who had divulged information about the SIGINT activities on the island to investigative journalists, Crispin Aubrey and Duncan Campbell. All three were tried, and the first initials of their surnames became the acronym for the trial. The first trial collapsed when it was revealed that the foreman of the jury was a former SAS officer who had served on Cyprus and at least two other members of the jury had signed the Official Secrets Act (OSA). A second trial was hampered by the gvernment admitting that most of the information that Berry had supplied to the two journalists was now in the public domain and so the offences under Section 1 of the OSA (which accused them of felony and acting against the state, offences with a maximum sentence of 14 years) were invalid. Whilst they were all convicted, none of them received custodial sentences. The Commander-in-Chief of 9 Signals Regiment was prosecuted for being involved in a smuggling and theft racket with the most senior non- commissioned officer in the same unit. They had traded with, among others, Turkish nationals whom they had been listening in on. All of the accused, who were from 9 Signals Unit on the base, were taken into custody in February 1984 and questioned. The case against them was built on the belief that they had suffered entrapment at the hands of the Soviets and were blackmailed into passing on secrets to the Russians after attending homosexual orgies. The accused alleged that they were subjected to torture and punishment beatings, including one who claimed that he had been questioned for 96 hours, though the official inquiry into the affair ruled that none of them had been \\"subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.\\" Formal charges were laid against seven of the men in April 1984 with an eighth being charged in June 1984. Trials In August 1984, a year before the case went to trial, Aircraftsman Paul Davies, who was also serving in Cyprus, was acquitted on charges related to exchanging secrets for sexual favours from a local woman that the press had dubbed Mata Hari. It was alleged that in 1983, he passed classified information to Eva Jaafar, who was a Hungarian born wife of a Lebanese businessman. At the trial, Davies claimed his confession was made under duress and Jaafar testified in his defence despite no guarantees of immunity from prosecution whilst she was in Britain. The other eight accused from the following year, were all charged with the following; The trial took 119 days and was presided over by Sir John Stocker. The case was known variously under different names (the Cyprus Eight Case, the Cyprus Spy Trial, the Mata Hari Affair etc), with, in essence eight men being sent to trial, although only seven went through the whole trial. The case had officially started in late May/early June 1985 and the period at the start of the trial was down to the prosecution of David Hardman only. This was down to the fact that before his interrogation, a medical officer examined Hardman and declared him unfit to be questioned, but the service police still questioned him anyway. The counsel for the prosecution offered no evidence in his case and the judge instructed the jury to acquit him of the charges laid against him, which left the two army signallers, Martin Taffy and Anthony Glass, along with the five airmen (Geoffrey Jones, Adam Lightowler, Christopher Payne, Wayne Kriehn and Gwynfor Owen) to face trial.Six of the accused were from 2 Squadron, 9 Signals Regiment, which intercepted the SIGINT messages and the seventh man was an administrator. All plead not guilty to the charges. The prosecution opened their case on 10 June 1985 and stated that Senior Aircraftsman Geoffrey Jones was the ringleader who had coerced the others into the spy-ring with blackmail. Police Investigators on the island had only uncovered the spy-ring when Jones, who was due to be posted out of Cyprus, failed to get his clearances in time and so aroused suspicion. Jones had apparently become infatuated with a local singer by the name of Josie. When questioned about his untimely clearance from the unit, investigators became aware of something of far greater significance. In February 1982, Jones met a Saudi Arabian man named \\"John\\" in a nightclub and after a night of drinking, they went back to his flat in Larnaca on the coast. After a night of sex with two other men, John later revealed that he had images of the three men having sex and he used this leverage on Jones to acquire information from him. After the first day of opening statements, the trial was held in camera due to the secret nature of some of the information being revealed in court. In a similar vein to the Aircraftsman Davis court case a year earlier, the defence called those who they said were the handlers and spies on the receiving side of the information. Josie Igniliano, the Filipino cabaret singer who Jones was supposedly infatuated with and others whom the prosecution alleged were involved in the spy ring testified for the defence in September 1985. Igniliano and another singer, the defendants and in at least one case, a defendant's wife, all strenuously denied that the sexual encounters described by the prosecution ever took place. After the jury deliberated for seven days, all of the defendants were acquitted, with Jones the last to be discharged on 27 October 1985. The prosecution allegations were that the men had done \\"incalculable damage\\" to the United Kingdom, and stating that the spy-ring had given secrets away \\"by the bagful\\". The defendants argued that their confessions were tortured out of them, with the judge acknowledging in court that Jones had been questioned by the service police for 55 hours and by Special Branch by 21 hours. Jones had also spent 17 hours over three days writing out his statement. Jones said that his interrogators had told him that; Aftermath Due to the collapse of the trial and the allegations of mistreatment, the case was raised in the House of Commons, with the Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark demanding that the MoD pay compensation. The Labour Party's shadow defence minister,The Conservative party were in government in 1985 and the Labour Party were in opposition. Denzil Davies, accused the military police of \\"Gestapo-style methods\\", while Gerald Kaufman, the Labour Party's Home Affairs spokesman, demanded an explanation to the \\"pointless and humiliating charade\\". Peter Almond, writing in The Washington Times, described the failed court case and the spy allegations as a serious embarrassment for the British Government. In the editorial of The times for 29 October 1985, the leading article is in agreement stating; The UK government ordered an inquiry to be conducted by David Calcutt QC, which became known as the Calcutt Report. The report, which was delivered in May 1986, was quite scathing into the interview methods of the Service Police in Cyprus, but especially of the Royal Air Force Police. The publication of the report led to the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, John Stanley, announcing in Parliament that the seven men were entitled to ex gratia payments for being detained unlawfully. He stated that the arrests themselves were lawful, but the subsequent detention period that followed whilst being interviewed, was not in line with the standards and parameters laid down for arrested persons. The outcome of the case was also raised in the House of Lords where questions were asked about how widespread the Calcutt Report would go given the remit was to investigate the Royal Air Force Police and the Army Special Investigation Branch, but not on the Special Branch, who had taken over the investigation at a later date. The case was the longest espionage trial held in the UK courts system and cost over ¬£5 million ($7.1 million),The monetary values given represent those at October 1985. not including payments to those detained, and prompted the Army to overhaul its security procedures on Cyprus. The trials of 1984 and 1985 cost the commanding officer of 9 Signals Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Boyle, his chance of being Britain's first astronaut. When men under his command were sent to trial at the Old Bailey, he was de-listed from the programme so that he could head up the internal inquiry. The programme was curtailed anyway due to the 1986 Challenger Disaster.

He enjoyed a rags-to-riches career, from working as a ‚Äòmiller‚Äôs boy‚Äô at St. Albans to becoming the owner of one of the largest breweries in the London area. Halsey left his home town of St Albans and went to London ‚Äòwith 4s.6d. only in his pocket‚Äô, and found work at James Child's Anchor Brewery in Southwark. He began by sweeping the yards, but was promoted to become clerk of the brewery's counting-house. He eventually married James Child's only daughter Anne Child on 17 October 1693, and became a partner in the business. By May 1696 he had already garnered enough wealth to loan ¬£1,000 to the crown. When Child died in September 1696, he assumed complete control of the brewery. By that time Halsey may have already become involved in local politics, for the elections committee reported in December 1696 on the testimony of a ‚ÄòMr Halsey‚Äô on a disputed election. He became Freeman of the Brewers‚Äô Company in 1697. Halsey was put forward as a candidate in December 1711 for Southwark, which had several brewers supporting the Whig cause. He was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Southwark at the by-election on 12 January 1712, although he actually finished 16 votes behind his opponent, Sir George Mathews. Mathews petitioned and as the committee reported several irregularities at the poll, the House ruled in favour of Mathews, and Halsey was unseated on 7 February 1712. Halsey became master of the Brewers Company in 1715. He was returned as MP for Buckingham at a by-election on 30 November 1717 through the influence of his son-in-law, Sir Richard Temple, 4th Baronet. In the House he supported the administration. He was a governor of St Thomas‚Äô Hospital by 1719 and a director of the South Sea Company in 1721, holding both positions for the rest of his life. At the 1722 British general election he was returned again in a contest for Southwark. His local interest was probably increased by the growing success of his brewery, and in 1724 he spent ¬£12,000 on the purchase of the manor of Stoke Poges. He was returned unopposed for Southwark at the 1727 British general election. Halsey died in August 1729. Two sons predeceased him and he left an only daughter, Anne, Viscountess Cobham, who inherited the Stoke Poges property. His widow died in 1741. The brewing business was sold for a reported ¬£30,000 to Ralph Thrale of Streatham, his brewery clerk and son of his sister Anne who had married Ralph Thrale of Offley, Hertfordshire.

It was designed by John Thomas Kelleher of the state Public Works Department, possibly with the assistance of A. J. McDonald, and built in 1890 by George Diggle. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  The first Euroa Post Office was opened by John De Boos on 1 January 1854 and a telegraph office was provided at the railway station in 1876, followed by a PO savings bank in 1878. The town's first permanent post office building, a new single-storey building constructed of polychrome brick, was constructed on the same site in 1883-4 by J. H. Brewer, however this burnt down on 23 February 1889. The current building, constructed of red face brick, was erected by builder George Diggle in 1890 for ¬£1,300. It incorporated remnant brick walling from the original building into the rear ground floor areas. The original sub-treasury area at the northwest corner of the building was converted to a telephone exchange prior to 1960. Between 1962 and 1968, the building underwent major alteration to front of the building, plus substantial internal changes to the postal areas and former residence. The latter included subdivision of the kitchen pantry, provision of a side entrance to the residential stair, conversion of first floor sitting room to a kitchen and bathroom, and a double-storey toilet block constructed at the southern end of the north-south passage. This addition also included an external laundry block at the southwest corner of the building. By this time, the original timber picket fence along both frontages had been removed and replaced with a standard picket fence in front of the western side garden and eastern rear yard. A new clock was installed in 1968. Presumably the alterations were recognition of Euroa's increase in size - its population had more than doubled to around 4500 in around 50 years, as the town serviced an increasing Hume Highway traffic and assumed a role as district capital. In 1986-88, a single-storey rear addition was constructed at the south-east corner of the building to provide loading dock facilities to Brock Street and an opening was created in the original rear wall to interconnect this space to the contractor's area (original ground floor bedrooms). A brick scooter shed was constructed at the adjacent corner of the property. In the 1990s and then in 2002, ramped access was constructed to the rear of the 1960s post office addition and public space interior refurbished to Australia Post standards. This included reducing the long counter to a small angled service counter in the northwest corner of the shop and enlargement of the retail area. The post box lobby and main entrance were also retiled.  Description  Euroa Post Office is at 90 Binney Street, Euroa, comprising the whole of Lot 1 on Plan of Subdivision No. 147805A. Euroa Post Office of 1890 is located at the south-west corner of Binney and Brock streets, at the eastern end of Euroa's principal retail strip. The post office building forms a streetscape pairing with the nearby 1892 Court House at 99 Binney Street, and contributes to the predominantly Victorian and Edwardian surrounds. The building is now built to the Brock Street frontage, but originally had a narrow garden setting on the east and west sides. Vehicular access to the site is provided at the south-east corner with a recent concrete driveway providing access to 1980s rear loading dock and scooter shed. An earlier timber-framed and corrugated steel shed survives in the rear garden. The 1890 post office building was a double-storey symmetrical design facing north-east, parallel with the Binney Street frontage and comprised a breakfront containing recessed ground floor porch and first floor \\"piazza\\", and two single-storey flanking pavilions projecting beyond the breakfront. This Tshaped plan, with verandahed quarters to the rear, followed the original single-storey post office of 1883-4, retaining some or most of the surviving fabric in the ground floor walling. This fabric is indicated by polychrome brickwork as opposed to plain red of the later building and is clearly visible in the rear side elevations at ground floor level. The slate-finished roofscape is punctuated by tall red face brick chimneys and the eaves are lined with beaded timber lining boards. The 1890s load-bearing walls are finished in exposed tuckpointed face red brick, lined with five cement string- courses over the two storeys, and a rock-faced bluestone plinth with tooled margins. As noted above, the remnant 1883 polychrome brickwork is evident in the rear sections at ground floor level. Two single-storey pavilions project forward under simple gables, complementing the main breakfront gable above, however the eastern bay has been widened to double its original width, although it contains the original arched window. The western bay, however, has a non-original arched doorway and steps. These three gables have non-original timber bargeboards, replacing the original moulded design. Below the main breakfront gable is a roundel, now containing a non-original clock, and below that three linked arches with stuccoed pilasters, architraves and flanking quoins rest on a panelled floor course now labelled with non-original lettering. Below that is a sculpted spandrel above the, now infilled, main entry arch, with paired crests of the Queen and St George/England to each side, a popular motif in the contemporary American free Romanesque. The crests were linked by a field of relief sculpture proclaiming the construction date. The original main entry arch is in brick with rendered voussoirs and a moulded arch line, with a moulded brick archivolt and reveal and non-original timber- framed lunette with leaded glazing. Original fenestration throughout the building has round arches in face brick with timber-framed double-hung sash windows in and lunettes divided into quadrants in the arches themselves. This arrangement was echoed in the upper storey quarters windows, though the lunettes on these were single-paned. Initially the lower string course was tiled in to fit the upper fence line, while the lower fence line, with double the newels, lined up with the plinth top. The eastern elevation is screened by a double-height timber-framed and floored verandah with timber balustrades and friezes, and a roofline integral with the main quarters roof. Externally, Euroa Post Office was substantially altered in the 1960s, although at the time, the alterations were believed to be in keeping with the original architectural concept. The works included a major alteration to the front of building to incorporate a larger post office area at the north-east corner, and a larger mailroom and private post office box area in the original sub- treasury area. The work involved widening of the eastern single-storey breakfront wing towards the side street, effectively doubling the original bay width. The original arched counter in the southern wall was removed and a long new counter was installed, reoriented to the eastern wall. A new single-storey office was constructed directly behind this wing, concealing the original entrance from the side verandah, and the adjacent original window was altered to provide a new doorway from the verandah. The original main arched entrance to the ground floor porch was also infilled and the porch area incorporated into an enlarged mailroom. The mailroom was also extended in a southerly direction, absorbing two original ground floor bedrooms. In addition, the original clock in the front gable was replaced with the present projecting illuminated clock, the original \\"POST & TELEGRAPH OFFICE\\" inscription was removed from the label course and replaced by a simpler steel sign \\"EUROA POST OFFICE\\" in Roman lettering, and additional illuminated signage was installed. The decorated bargeboards were also removed and replaced with plain barges. Internally, the original program and planning of the ground floor was also substantially and significantly obscured by the 1960s works, although the bulk of original joinery remains intact. While it was not inspected, the integrity of the first floor form and fabric is apparently relatively high. Key areas/elements include: * The original building presentation to both streets and garden, including overall massing and form, unpainted brickwork, decorative cement appliqu√©, verandah, recessed \\"piazza\\", projecting gables, and roof form; * presentation of the quarters; * plan form of residence and verandah and piazza (main stair, configuration of rooms and fireplace placements). Externally and internally the Euroa Post Office appears to be in relatively sound condition, well maintained and with no major defects visible. Original fabric includes: * Structural frame: Load-bearing brick walling on bluestone base; timber-framed floor on masonry piers and timber-framed roof. * External walls: Tuckpointed face red brick with cement dressed courses and stucco appliqu√©; coursed rock-faced bluestone base with tooled margins. * Internal walls: Hard plastered finish to brick walling; timber-framed partitions with lathe and plaster finish. * Floor: Timber boards on timber- framed floor and masonry footings throughout with the exception of the original ground floor porch which was tessellated tiled; bluestone thresholds and front steps. * Ceiling: Strapped plaster with moulded cornice. * Roof: Gabled with slate finish, beaded timber lining boards and sections of exposed timber rafters; timber barge boards finished with moulded timber roundels; multiple red face chimneys with corbelled caps and terracotta chimney pots. * Other: Decorative wrought iron gate and turnstile to ground floor porch; clock fitted in main gable; timber-framed verandah with timber fretwork to east elevation; moulded timber joinery throughout interior with architrave roundels, panelled timber doors and timber mantels and surrounds.  Heritage listing  Euroa Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 with the following rationale:. Euroa Post Office of 1890, which originally incorporated a post office, telegraph office, sub-treasury and integrated residence, is of historical and social significance. The post office has been a very prominent and highly visible public and postal building for 120 years in Euroa, and forms an important streetscape pairing with the nearby 1892 Court House. The substantial post office incorporates part of an earlier 1880s postal building, which burnt down; it also underwent major remodelling and additions in the 1960s, at a time when Euroa's population was increasing as the town serviced the growing Hume Highway traffic and assumed a role as the local district \\"capital\\". The emphasis given to the post office, in promotional material for the town, also helps demonstrate its social significance in the local context Euroa Post Office is an example of a: # Post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1920); # Victorian period building in a Romanesque style with American freestyle and Federation Queen Anne influences; # Building by Public Works Department architect, JT Kelleher, possibly with the assistance of AJ McDonald. Typologically, Euroa Post Office is an example of a combined post and telegraph office and sub-treasury with integrated quarters, originally skilfully unified into a composite form, but subsequently substantially altered. The works to the building have impacted on the integrity of the original separate functions and diminished evidence of the original internal relationships, although the residential component is believed to be more intact at first floor level. The bulk of original joinery also remains intact. Stylistically and architecturally, Euroa Post Office in its original form was a fine example of a design which combined Romanesque style with American freestyle and Federation Queen Anne influences. It was also one of several 1890s post office and courthouse designs where a free Romanesque style was mixed with other treatments. The 1960s alterations and additions altered the building front quite substantially, particularly in relocating the entries, and are confusing at one level as they attempted to retain and work within the original freestyle. On the other hand, the thoroughness with which the free Romanesque was pursued in these alterations was rare in Australia in the early 1960s, coming before Romanesque and nineteenth century Italianate and freestyles were generally well understood in architectural circles. Accepting that the architectural qualities of the building have been diminished by these works, the original symmetry and overall building form and detailing are largely retained, including the main breakfront, first floor \\"piazza\\", single-storey flanking pavilions, arched openings and vigorous gabled roof forms. The main breakfront gable in particular retains its roundel, and three linked arches below with stuccoed pilasters, architraves and flanking quoins, and below this again the sculpted spandrel above the infilled main entry arch which in turn retains the paired crests which were a popular motif in the contemporary American free Romanesque. Euroa Post Office is also a competent example of the work of Public Works Department architect, JT Kelleher and possibly AJ McDonald, comparing directly with their work on the nearby Euroa Courthouse (1892). Aesthetically, Euroa Post Office Euroa is a landmark building on a principal street corner, deriving aesthetic value from its scale and prominence, vigorous gabled roof forms and tall chimneys, and redbrick walls contrasting with the rendered Romanesque detailing. The building also complements the nearby Euroa Court House (1892), by the same architect, and makes an important contribution to the historic character and visual harmony of the town streetscape. The post office is additionally prominent among local historic buildings which are featured in promotional material for the town. The curtilage includes the title block/allotment of the property. Significant elements of Euroa Post Office include the two-storey 1890 post office building, and the remnant 1884-4 ground floor fabric from the earlier post office on site. Non-significant elements include the later mostly skillion- roofed brick additions, 1980s rear loading dock, recent brick scooter shed, brick-walled concrete ramp and earlier but still utilitarian timber-framed and corrugated steel shed to rear of site.

Biography  Beryl Mildred Cryer was born in England in 1889, and migrated to Canada with her family as a child. She lived in Chemainus, BC for much of her life. She died in Welland, Ontario in 1980.  Work  An educated woman from a privileged background, and married to a businessman, Beryl Cryer was both a homemaker, and a journalist and newspaper columnist. She was introduced by her neighbour Mary Rice (Tzea-Mntenaht) and also by Jennie Wyse (Tstass-Aya) and other Elders, to cultural traditions and narratives of the Hul'qumi'num people and this connection was key, allowing her to receive the stories of places and people that feature in so much of her writing. The stories that she gathered from Elders, mostly women, through her relationship with Mary Rice were the source of many newspaper articles about Indigenous life and history on Vancouver Island, including oral narrative stories published between 1929 and 1935 in the Victoria Daily Colonist Sunday Magazine. She also published the book Flying Canoe: Legends of the Cowichans in 1949. Highlighting the unique value of Cryer's work, scholar Sarah Morales reflects that Cryer didn't guide her interviewees, but rather listened carefully and recorded stories of the Elders just as they were told to her, resulting in a richness and completeness not found in other ethnographic sources.  Legacy  Cryer's writings, and the stories passed on through her by many Hul‚Äôqumi‚Äônum Elders, have been an important and unique resource both to Indigenous and settler communities, and to scholarship in the social life and history of Vancouver Island.

He is mainly known for his commentaries to the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi (also known as the Nanhua Zhenjing).  Life  Cheng Xuanying was born sometime around the first decade of the seventh century CE, in Shan Prefecture in modern-day Henan. He lived in Donghai in seclusion until 631, when he was summoned to the Tang capital Chang'an and appointed the head monk of Xihua Abbey by the imperial decree of Emperor Taizong.New Book of Tang, vol. 59. The New Book of Tang does not mention being accorded the title of Master of Doctrines (), and it is likely that this was a later fabrication of the Song period. Prior to his summoning, he was a philosopher well-known for his commentary on the popular Lingbao scripture, the Clarified Meaning of the Scripture of Universal Salvation ().Chou Ya-ching , Cheng Xuanying sixiang yanjiu (Taipei: Xinwenfeng, 2003), 71-73.Choi, Jin-Hee , Cheng Xuanying Zhuangzi shu yanjiu (Chengdu: Bashu shushe, 2010), 17. Some scholars alternatively maintain that Cheng was summoned to the capital to serve as the disciple of Liu Jinxi (fl. 620), a major representative of (Chongxuan) Daoist thought at the Institute of Education ().Lu Guolong, Zhongguo chongxuan xue (Beijing: Zhongguo renmin chubanshe, 1993), 222 and 235-6. In 636 and 638 Cheng was present for a series of debates between Daoists and Buddhists at the temple of the monk Huijing ( b.578) along with Cai Zihuang (), a fellow Chongxuan adherent.Zhang, Shuheng. ‚ÄúForming the Image of Cheng Xuanying (Ca.600-690).‚Äù University of Washington Libraries ResearchWorks Service, 2018, digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/41709. Cheng, again along with Cai, participated in the translation of the Daodejing into Sanskrit in 647, headed by the eminent Buddhist monk Xuanzang. Cheng was responsible for explaining the meaning of the Daodejing to Xuanzang in order to translate it.Ji Xianlin , Ji Xianlin fojiao xueshu lunwen ji (Taipei: Dongchu chubanshe, 1995), 463-486. Xuanying wanted to translate the term Dao as bodhi, but Xuanzang rejected it in favor of mƒÅrga ( \\"road/path\\").Ji gujin fodao lunheng 3, 52.387a. He also requested that the Heshanggong commentary be translated as well, which Xuanzang similarly denied.Ji gujin fodao lunheng 3, 52.387b. In 647 Cheng and Zhang Huiyuan () were commissioned to investigate the major Daoist scripture known as the Sanhuangjing. They determined it was \\"an absurdly written document, in no way composed in the current time\\",Fayuan zhulin jiaoshi, 55.1675-6. and all copies of the text were then ordered burned by Emperor Taizong, leading to the near-total destruction of all copies of the scripture. Cheng was banished to Yuzhou () around 653 following a draught during the Yonghui reign (650-655) of Emperor Gaozong, likely due to his interpretation of the Classic of Changes as explaining the occurrence of natural disasters, which the court saw as a prognostication of the draught. He died sometime between 685 and 690.. Xin Deyong , Liangjing xinji jijiao (Xi‚Äôan: Sanqin chubanshe, 2006), 3.65.  Commentaries  Cheng wrote one of the more significant commentaries to the Zhuangzi, the Subcommentary to the Zhuangzi (ZhuƒÅngz«ê sh≈´ ). His commentary, valued for its concise explanations and character glosses, is a sub-commentary to Guo Xiang's; traditionally, both commentaries have been handed down together. Both commentaries have been handed down to posterity in the Daozang as the Commentary and Subcommentary on the True Scripture of Southern Florescence (N√°nh√∫a Zhƒìnjƒ´ng Zh√πsh≈´ ) in 30 juan. Cheng also wrote 2 juan of commentary on the Daodejing, and 7 juan of subcommentary on the Laozi kaiti xujue (). Fragments of these texts have survived in quotations.http://en.daoinfo.org/wiki/Cheng_Xuanying Cheng's commentary focuses on first using the Mystery ( xuan) to transcend Being ( you) and Nonbeing ( wu), and then to transcend the Mystery itself.Assandri, Friederike. ‚ÄúUnderstanding Double Mystery: Daoism in Early Tang as Mirrored in the FDLH (T 2104) and Chongxuanxue.‚Äù Academia.edu, https://www.academia.edu/21980223. Cheng believed that the Dao \\"is eternally deep and still, it is neither form nor sound, neither personal name nor style; solitary, it alone surpasses the logic of the tetralemma, vague and indistinct it goes beyond the hundred negations.‚ÄùAssandri, Friederike. ‚ÄúMYSTERY AND SECRECY IN THE CONTACT OF DAOISM AND BUDDHISM IN EARLY MEDIEVAL CHINA.‚Äù Academia.edu, https://www.academia.edu/25463869. Cheng's commentary on the Lingbao Scripture of Universal Salvation, the Clarified Meaning of the Scripture of Universal Salvation (), was extremely popular in its time and likely resulted in his summoning to Chang'an in 631. It is preserved in the Daozang. Additionally, Cheng composed a work in 5 juan on the Classic of Changes, the Diagram on the Circulation and Development of the Changes of Zhou (), which is lost and rarely-mentioned. Records of the work say it \\"examined across and synthesized all sixty-four hexagrams and explained the Nine Palaces, extrapolating the weal and woe of the state down to the months and days.\\"Ruan Yuan comp., Quben Junzhai dushu zhi (Nanjing: Jiangsu guji chubanshe, 1988), 1.9a-b and Wang Xianqian (1842-1917), Junzhai dushuzhi (Guangxu jiashen Qu-Yuan hekeben, 1884), 1.11a.

CEAC was the first ever multi-media centre owned and operated by an artist-run centre in Toronto and the largest non-institutional art space during its time. The centre engaged with artists, musicians, and activists from across North America through organized exhibitions, in addition to hosting video production facilities, workshops, screening, and performance series'. CEAC encouraged artist-to-artist communication and provided a platform for Canadian artists to expand their knowledge through international tours. The centre was also home to the radical art magazine Art Communication Edition, later renamed STRIKE. Despite its success as an artist-run centre from 1976 through to 1978, CEAC was disbanded in the summer of 1978 following scandal and the withdrawal of government funding from the Ontario Arts Council During its years of operation, CEAC was invested in the radical juxtaposition of materialist practices and communication through art. A recurring theme throughout its programming included the synthesis of language and/as art, and technology. CEAC's multimedia approach to art bridged across many platforms, and included art exhibitions, international tours, workshops, conferences, film and video screenings, art performances, and music events. The centre housed a library and archives, a video production studio, a performance space, a film theatre, and a punk-music venue. A chief concern of CEAC was the critique of social norms and formalism and the commodification of art, a characteristic of similar art groups formed during the apex of conceptual art throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Amerigo Marras, CEAC's co-founder (alongside Suber Donald Corley) and chief theoretician, promoted \\"contextual art\\" as a process that deconstructs meanings that no longer correspond to reality and allows the audience to introduce new meanings. The group celebrated the exhibition of avant-garde and non-material art practices (performance art, happening, body art, experimental film, et cetera), and was dedicated to ‚Äúa continuous collective experiment in living and in sociological infiltrations with practical demonstrations.‚Äù  Locations  Photograph of present-day 15 Duncan Street, Toronto, Ontario. Before the formation of CEAC, their members and their peers co-worked in shared spaces. CEAC's founders Amerigo Marras and Suber Donald Corley purchased a house at 4 Kensington Avenue in the Market area, allowing early incarnations of The Body Politic and Glad Day Bookshop to use a shed behind the house as an alternative space. In the early 1970s, Jearld Moldenhauer moved into Marras and Corley's apartment at 65 Kendal Avenue - this address served as the official home for Glad Day Books and The Body Politic. Previous to the formation of CEAC, Marras and Corley were affiliated with the Kensington Art Association (KAA). Following a $55,000 Wintario grant, KAA became the first artist-run organization in Toronto to buy a building and effectively establish a large multimedia centre. After acquiring 15 Duncan Street in September 1976, KAA launched CEAC. The centre's large, four-storey building in the light-manufacturing in the area south west of Queen Street and University Avenue, now known as the Entertainment District, where it became an instrumental hub for Toronto's creative cultural scene. Funnel Experimental Film Theatre The Funnel Experimental Film Theatre (1977-1989) was an experimental cinema collective that gathered in the basement of CEAC's 15 Duncan Street location. The collective was born out a concept of \\"hybrid telemedia\\", whereby independent video production would intersect with television's mass communication systems; emphasizing broadcast quality and colour technology. Founding the Canadian Super 8 Distribution Centre in 1976, CEAC organized regular screenings and Super 8 Open Screenings which provided a focus for local filmmakers. These screenings led to the creation of a video production studio in the basement of CEAC and the formation of The Funnel Experimental Film Theatre in September 1977, co- founded, amongst others, by filmmaker Ross McLaren, who was then teaching filmmaking at OCAD University. The Funnel's video program included Noel Harding, David Clarkson, Elizabeth MacKenzie, Susan Britton, Peter Dudar, John Massey, Ian Murray, and members of the Development Education Centre and Trinity Square Video. Filmmakers exhibiting at CEAC showcased during this period included: Vera Frenkel in the \\"Language Art\\" series of 1975; Darryl Tonkin's film Cantilever Tales (1975) in the \\"Body Art\\" series; Michael Snow, Rick Hancox, Vito Acconci, and David Rimmer in the \\"Art Film\\" series of 1977; Holly Dale, Janis Cole, and Al Razutis; and Ross McLaren with the documentary film Crash 'N' Burn (1977). Other associated artists included Keith Locke, Jim Anderson, Peter Dudar, Eldon Garnet, David Rimmer, Rick Hancox, Ron Gillespie, Noel Harding, Raphael Bendahan, and Chris Gallagher. Following CEAC's closure in 1978, The Funnel moved to 507 King Street East where about 30 members built a state-of-the-art 100 seat theatre, recording/projecting studio, darkroom, library and office. Suffering a political split in 1986, the group finally dissolved in 1989 Centre for Experimental Art and Language (CEAC) School In early 1978, the centre established the CEAC school which held several workshops and seminars, including: *\\"Basic Film Making\\" held by Ross McLaren, covering films, cameras, lenses, lighting, exposure, sound, editing, production and distribution. *\\"Movement Workshop\\" held by Lily Eng, examined methods of movement and choreography, exercises and spatial explorations. *\\"Words\\" held by John Faichney, aimed at making one's vocabulary a tool for expression. *\\"Thought and Thinking\\" *\\"Video Cassette Editing\\" *\\"Art and Revolution\\" *\\"Colour Theory and Practice'  Publications  KAA/CEAC published 9 magazine issues under the name Art Communication Edition (A.C.E) between the years 1976-1977 and 3 issues as STRIKE in 1978. The publication Art Communication Edition was reinvented as STRIKE due to a desire to \\"merge with the social stance with consumerist tactics, the antithetical position\\". The magazine dealt with contemporary art in Toronto and abroad. It was distributed monthly in Canada, the United States, throughout Europe, South America and Australia. The material published included activities of the CEAC, features on film and performances, books, and statements on recent research and developments in the arts.  Controversy  The contents of the second issue of CEAC's magazine, STRIKE, and its radical political program caused major controversy that led to the withdrawal of funding from the Ontario Arts Council and the Canada Council. The May 1978 issue of STRIKE, in support of the Italian militarist group, The Red Brigades, and Red Brigade-style ‚Äúart- world‚Äù kneecapping, was charged with promoting violent overthrow of authority. The controversial issue included an excerpt from a 1937 work by Mao Tse-tung: ‚ÄúTo still maintain tolerance towards the servants of the State is to preserve the status quo of Liberalism. In the Manner of the [Red] Brigades, we support leg shooting/knee capping in order to accelerate the demise of the old system‚Äù. Scandal broke quickly after the editorial was published, with a headline on the front page of Toronto Sun on May 5, 1978 reading: ‚ÄúOnt. Grant Supports Red Brigades Ideology: Our Taxes Aid Blood Thirsty Radical Paper‚Äù. Following nearly immediate loss of funding in June and July 1978 following the controversial May article, CEAC was forced to close its doors, unable to meet mortgage payments on the 15 Duncan Street location. Competitive animosities and lack of support between CEAC and other Torontonian artist-run centres, notably A Space Gallery, also became clear in the aftermath following the STRIKE scandal and CEAC's demise. A 1978 letter to CEAC from the Video Officer for the Canada Council, Renee Bart, stated: > \\"[The] Council has received numerous written and verbal complaints about the > lack of access to the CEAC facility, an alleged censorship of projects in > the selection process, the disdainful manner in which many artists either > using or requesting the use of the facilities were treated [...] This is a > very clear indication of a lack of support for, or confidence in the CEAC > from the very community which it was funded to serve, and gives rise to > questions about CEAC's use of public funds.\\". CEAC's subsequent and final third issue of STRIKE stated, in response to the scandal: ‚Äúwhat we wish to make clear is that what happened to STRIKE and CEAC is a definite case of censorship, in fact, political repression [...] our project was conceived of as a social experiment, designed to expose the illusions of freedom within the arts and the greater context of liberal democracies‚Äù; \\"As the Futurists were in fascist Italy; as the Bauhaus was in Nazi Germany; as the Constructivists were in the Soviet Union, the CEAC was banned in Canada.‚ÄùCEAC advertisement, Ontario Association of Art Galleries, Magazine, Winter 1978/79. CEAC's founders Amerigo Marras and Suber Corley relocated to New York City following the controversy in 1978  Influence  CEAC has been credited with influencing the development of the Toronto art scene and the art hub at Queen and Spadina by many art historians. Of the many existing art institutions that moved to the area during the mid 1970s, including the Music Gallery, Art Metropole, A Space Gallery, and others, as well as new spaces which opened up, YYZ, Mercer Union, and the Cabana Room, CEAC was the largest and most avant-grade. CEAC has also been credited with sponsoring the first punk venue in Canada, Crash ‚ÄôN‚Äô Burn and with developing the early punk-rock scene in Toronto. Crash 'n' Burn In the spring of 1977, the Toronto underground scene saw an explosion of local bands adopting the style and counterculture ethos of the New York and British punk movements. Perceiving the phenomenon as a spontaneous behavioural reaction against mainstream media, CEAC sponsored the first punk venue in Canada, Crash 'n' Burn. Organized by The Diodes,David Farrell (14 January 1978). Canada learns to Pogo. Billboard. Nielsen Business Media, Inc. pp. 66‚Äì. ISSN 0006-2510. a band composed of OCA students, Crash 'n' Burn was located in the basement of CEAC from May through August 1977. The original members of The Diodes Paul Robinson, John Catto, David Clarkson, John Hamilton, and Ian MacKay‚Äîcollaborated with Amerigo Marras and Bruce Eves in the production of a 45-rpm disc entitled \\"Raw/War\\", which was distributed as the 8th issue of Art Communication Edition. The music on the record was scattered among droning statements by Marras and Eves from the Behavioural Manifestos of CEAC and Reindeer Werk (performance-duo of Tom Puckey & Dirk Larsen).

Other bands that played Crash 'n' Burn, included The Curse and The B Girls; The Poles; The Viletones; The Dishes; and The Dead Boys. In 1977, Ross McLaren made the experimental film called \\"Crash 'n' Burn\\" shot in and named after the club. The film, shot on 16mm black-and-white stock, features punk rock performances by the Dead Boys, Teenage Head, The Boyfriends, and the Diodes.Guttenplan, Howard. \\"Ross McLaren: One Person Program,\\" Millennium Film Workshop Upcoming Screenings. New York: Millennium Film Workshop, 2004. Village Voice critic Ed Halter called the film a \\"self-destructive document of Toronto's eponymous punk club.\\" The short-lived energy of the venue ended in September 1977, when CEAC closed Crash 'n' Burn forever. Later in 1977, the basement of CEAC was transformed into The Funnel Experimental Film Theatre's headquarters.  Tours and exhibitions  CEAC's first exhibition, presented in January 1976, was entitled Body Art. The exhibition investigated the body's architecture, transmutation, and social behaviour. Featured artists included Suzy Lake, Darryl Tonkin, Lily Eng and Peter Dudar, amongst others. The exhibition was influenced in part by the Vienna School and Hermann Nitsch. It established a platform for performance and non-objective art, which countered present strategies of appropriation and parody then promoted by the art-collective General Idea, also operating in Toronto during that time. Bound, Bent and Determined, a performance series organized by Bruce Eves, elaborated on the theme of sado-masochism taken up by Body Art.. Featured artists included: Wendy Knox-Leet, Ron Gillespie, Heather MacDonald, Darryl Tonkin, Blast-Bloom, Bruce Eves, Andy Fabo and Paul Dempsey CEAC began to promote art in New York and on the European continent in 1976. CEAC highlighted the work of the Missing Associates, Ron Gillespie, and made their initial connections with the Polish contextual artists, the ‚Äúaction‚Äù school of performance, and Reindeer Werk. CEAC's second European tour was in May 1977. Taking part in discussions held in Paris by the Sociological Art Collective and in Poland by the contextual art movement, the CEAC group also presented collaborative performances in various art venues, asserting the importance of performance as a means to break down audience/performer barriers. In one seminar/performance, Bruce Eves, Amerigo Marras, Diane Boadway, and Suber Corley placed themselves in the four corners of a gallery, taking turns reading from a text, and speaking in turns into a microphone for fifteen seconds at a time. The text consisted of ‚Äúseventy statements proposing an antithetical stance to dominant ideology rather than alternative positions that could be reappropriated by the cultural hegemony‚Äù. Throughout its few years of operation, CEAC collaborated and exhibited with a multitude of artists, such as Sarah Charlesworth, Joseph Kosuth, Anthony McCall, Dennis Oppenheim, Martha Rosler, Carolee Schneeman, and Lawrence Weiner, and had organized concerts by Philip Glass and Steve Reich.

Plot In 1866, in the runup to the Fenian Rising, Brian Malone was falsely denounced as an informer. In 1919, his grandson of the same name aims to clear the family name by serving in the IRA. Reception The Irish Times correspondent wrote, \\"The Dawn, in spite of various crudities, is as thrilling a show as ever I want to witness, and its amateur cast gives it a freshness which is all too rare.\\" It was contrasted with Ourselves Alone, which had portrayed \\"clean-limbed police\\" with the IRA men shown as \\"tough hombres\\"; The Dawn, on the other hand, depicted the Black and Tans as \\"too scoundrelly for words\\" and was liable to make Unionist viewers squirm.The Irish Times (Tuesday, August 25, 1936), page 4. Cooper received an award from Cork Film Festival in the late 1970s. An original 35 mm print is stored in the British Film Institute; it was digitised and restored in 2016. Prints are also held by RT√â and the Irish Film Institute.

Her work often addresses memory and the construction of history.  Education  Sawyer earned an Honours Diploma in Photography from Emily Carr University of Art and Design in 1982 and an Interdisciplinary Master of Fine Arts (Visual Art, Music, Theatre) from Simon Fraser University in 1998.  Professional activities  Sawyer has served as a board member for the Canadian Photographic Portfolio Society, Or Gallery, and the Western Front, and has taught as a sessional instructor at Emily Carr University of Art and Design and Simon Fraser University's School for the Contemporary Arts. Sawyer has received numerous BC Arts Council and Canada Council grants and has been an artist-in-residence at the Western Front and the Banff Centre for the Arts. In 2018 Canada Council for the Arts awarded Sawyer the prestigious Duke and Duchess of York Prize in Photography.Her work is included in the collections of the Canada Council Art Bank (Ottawa), the City of Vancouver, Microsoft Corporation (Seattle) and the Museum of Fine Arts (Houston).  Art practice  Carol Sawyer is active in a wide array of disciplines. The following is a selected list of her artistic projects.  Natalie Brettschneider  Sawyer conducts research and makes artwork that enriches the Natalie Brettschneider Archive, a genre-defying fictional Canadian artist active in the early 20th- century. Brettschneider's life - as seen through letters, photographs, paintings and film - intersects with and brings light to a rich community of interdisciplinary women artists working in Canada and abroad. When Sawyer began this project in the 1990s, very little had been written about the women involved in Dada and surrealist movements. This project helps shed light on the ways that male artists have dominated art history.  The Scholar's Study: Still Life  This single-channel video projection draws from footage Sawyer shot while dismantling the home office of her late father, Alan R. Sawyer, a prominent scholar of pre-Columbian Andean and Peruvian art. Over the course of nearly a year, Sawyer's camera recorded the slow withdrawal of her father's presence from a room where he had spent countless hours, as hundreds of historical artifacts, slides, and his library and professional papers, were carefully photographed, catalogued, and archived.  Shadow Puppet  Exhibited in 2015 at Republic Gallery, Vancouver, and again in 2017 at the same gallery as part of UTOPIAS CONSTRUCTED III, this video installation and group of photographs document a series of short performances in which Sawyer uses cardboard and plastic to turn herself into a life-sized shadow puppet.  I attempt from love's sickness to fly, in vain  Exhibited in 2017 at Republic Gallery in Vancouver, BC, in conjunction with the Capture Festival of Photography, this project is a video and group of photographs based on an aria written by English Baroque composer Henry Purcell.  ion Zoo  Since the late 1990s Sawyer has performed as a vocalist with the avant-garde, improvisational, jazz-influenced music group ion Zoo. Their albums include Set Free at the Cellar and Venus Looks Good. ion Zoo was also commissioned by Los Angeles-based composer Michael Vlatkovich and Albuquerque-based poet Mark Weber to record the album Elasticity.  Voxy  Along with singer Kate Hammett-Vaughan, from 2007 to 2016 Sawyer ran an annual workshop series about improvisation for singers.

Violators of so-called \\"Bible bans\\" have been punished by killing, imprisonment, forced labor, and banishment, as well as by burning or confiscating the Bible or Bibles used or distributed. Censorship of the Bible occurred in historical times and is still going on today. The Index Librorum Prohibitorum of the Catholic Church included various translations of the Bible. In most cases, the bans on pious lay people possessing or using Bibles were related to vernacular Bible editions. Clerics were never forbidden to possess the Vulgate Bible translation in the Latin language. From the point of view of Protestantism, the topic mostly refers to historical provisions of the Catholic Church against reading or possessing Bibles not of the Latin Vulgate translation, or in the case of the laity, possessing any Bibles at all, including the Vulgate. From a Catholic point of view, one rarely speaks of Bible bans, because in their view the attempts by the hierarchy to prevent opposing biblical interpretations were justified. From a Catholic point of view, the censorship of the Bible was justified both by restricting Bibles from those lacking instruction and by censoring translations thought to encourage deviations from official doctrines.

The New Testament was written in Koine, a form of ancient Greek. The books were translated into several other languages, including Latin. From about A.D. 300 onward, Latin began to assert itself as the language of worship in Western Christianity. This was aided by the fact many European languages, called the Romance languages, are all descended from Latin. In contrast the earliest written Western Germanic languages date only from the 6th century. From A.D. 382-420, a new translation was made into the Latin vernacular, the Vulgate, which became the dominant translation for Western Christianity in the 7th-9th centuries. From about the 9th century it was regarded as the only valid Bible translation. In Eastern Christianity, on the other hand, Greek remained dominant.  Diocletianic persecution  During the Diocletianic Persecution, Bibles were targeted as part of a larger program intended to wipe out Christianity. On February 24, 303, Diocletian's first \\"Edict against the Christians\\" was published.Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 22; Clarke, 650; Potter, 337; de Ste Croix, \\"Aspects\\", 75; Williams, 176. Among other persecutions against Christians, Diocletian ordered the destruction of their scriptures and liturgical books across the entire Roman empire.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 8.2.4; De Martyribus Palestinae praef. 1; and Optatus, Appendix 2; Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 22; Clarke, 650; Liebeschuetz, 249-50; Potter, 337; de Ste Croix, \\"Aspects\\", 75.  During the Middle Ages  There were some controversies whether the translation in Old Church Slavonic was permissible. According to St. Methodius, he was officially allowed to use it by John VIII in 880. Yet Christians were forbidden to use the Old Church Slavonic translation by John X in 920 and by the Lateran Synod of 1059, with the synod being confirmed by Nicholas II and Alexander II. In a letter to Vratislav II of Bohemia dated 2 January 1080, Pope Gregory VII revoked his predecessors' permission to use the Slavonic language. The reason he gave was that \\"Not without reason has it pleased Almighty God that Holy Scripture should be a secret in certain places, lost, if it were plainly apparent to all men, perchance it would be little esteemed and be subject to disrespect; or it might be falsely understood by those of mediocre learning, and lead to error.\\"English Bible Translations Through 1611 A.

Herder-Verlag, 1972; abgedruckt in: KIBA ‚Äì Kirchenmusik im Bistum Aachen, August 2007, p. 16 However, the rite was under the protection of the Croatian kings and was so firmly rooted there that Pope Innocent IV in 1248 allowed the South Slavs the Latinized Slavonic Rite again. Between 1170‚Äì80, Peter Waldo commissioned a cleric from Lyon to translate the New Testament into the vernacular \\"Romance\\" (Franco-Proven√ßal). He is credited with providing to Europe the first translation of the Bible in a 'modern tongue' outside of Latin., p=18-19 In the struggle against the Bible-centered mass movements of the Cathars and the Waldensians, who had made their own translations on the basis of the Vulgate, the church moved to an increased control of Bible reception. In 1199, Innocent III, writing in a letter to the bishop of Metz, banned the reading the Bible in private meetings (which he labeled as occultis conventiculis, or \\"hidden assemblies\\"). However, he noted that the desire to read and study the divine scriptures, was not to blame, but rather it was a recommended disposition. Since, however, the individual by himself apart from private meetings could hardly procure Bible texts, this ban was practically equivalent to a Bible ban for lay people. Horst Robert Balz, Gerhard Krause, Gerhard M√ºller, Siegfried M. Schwertner, Claus-J√ºrgen Thornton, Matthias Glockner: Theologische Realenzyklop√§die. Walter de Gruyter, 1977, , p. 66 The following year, the Pope sent some abbots to Metz to order the burning of French Bible translations. In 1202, the papal envoy, Bishop Guido of Pr√§neste, issued a visitation to Leuven to enforce several provisions. In one of them, it was said that all books in the Latin and German languages concerning the Holy Scripture were to be delivered to the bishop. The bishop then decided which books to return. After the 1210 council held in Paris, Peter of Corbeil, Archbishop of Sens, issued a decree according to which all theological writings in Romance languages with the exception of saints' legends were to be delivered to the diocesan bishops. Since several cities or parishes had residents with differing languages and customs, it was decided at the Fourth Council of the Lateran under Innocent III that suitable people were to be sought who performed the priestly ministry according to their respective customs. After the end of the Albigensian Crusade, the Council of Toulouse tightened the provisions against the heretics in this ecclesiastical province. The Inquisition was the first to work nationwide, and the University of Toulouse was founded, to which the Catholic Institute of Toulouse is also called. At the synod a general Bible ban was pronounced for lay people of this ecclesiastical province, only Psalterium and Brevier in Latin were allowed.Correspondence on the formation, objects, and plan of the Roman Catholic Bible Society, 1813Edward Peters, Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe, Edited with an introduction by Edward Peters, (Scolar Press, London, 1980) , p.194‚Äì195.Pierre Allix, Ecclesiastical History of Ancient Churches of the Albigenses (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1821.)

Although sections of the Council Toulouse were used, this statement was omitted. In the course of a confirmation of the writings in 1215 at Fourth Council of the Lateran's condemnation of the writings of David of Dinant ordered Gregory IX. in 1231, to hand over all the theological books written in Latin to the diocesan bishops. At the Second Council of Tarragona (Conventus Tarraconensis) in 1234, the Spanish bishops, according to a decree of King James I of Aragon, declared that it was forbidden to anyone, to own a translation of the Bible. They had to be burned within eight days, otherwise, they were considered heretics.The Church Council of Tarragona (1234 AD), 2nd Cannon.D. Lortsch, Historie de la Bible en France, 1910, p.14.

In 1376, Pope Gregory XI ordered that all literature on the Bible should be placed under ecclesiastical direction. As a result, only the Vulgate and a few poor quality translations in national languages were tolerated. Das Neue Testament deutsch, √ñkumenisches Heiligenlexikon John Wycliffe (1330‚Äì1384), a theologian with pre-Reformation views, finished the first authoritative translation of the Bible from Latin into English in 1383. His teachings were rejected in 1381 by Oxford University and in 1382 by the church. For fear of a popular uprising Wycliffe was not charged. The translation of the Bible caused great unrest among the clergy, and for their sake, several defensive provincial synods were convened, such as the 3rd Council of Oxford (ended in 1408). Under the chairmanship of Archbishop Thomas Arundel, official positions against Wycliffe were written in the Oxford Constitution and Arundel Constitution. The latter reads as follows:A collection of the laws and canons of the Church of England: from its first foundation to the conquest, and from the conquest to the reign of King Henry VIII By John Johnson, 1851 Unlike before, translations of liturgical readings and preaching texts (psalms, pericopes from the Gospels and Epistles) were now bound to an examination by church authorities. Individuals like William Butler wanted to go even further and also limit Bible translations to the Latin language alone. In 1401, Parliament passed the De heretico comburendo law in order to suppress Wycliffe's followers and censor their books, including the Bible translation. At the Council of Constance in 1415, Wycliffe was finally proclaimed a heretic and condemned as \\"that pestilent wretch of damnable memory, yea, the forerunner and disciple of anti-christ who, as the complement of his wickedness, invented a new translation of the Scriptures into his mother-tongue.\\"Schaff's account of Wyclif and the Lollards, quote from Arundel His helpers Nicholas Hereford and John Purvey were forced to recant their teachings, and his bones, as determined by the council were finally burned in 1428. However, his translation of the Bible along with 200 manuscripts were secretly preserved and read by followers, and have survived to the present day. However, Wycliffe's Bible was not printed until 1731, when Wycliffe was historically conceived as the forefather of the English Reformation. Eberhard Zwink: Verwirrspiel um eine Bibel, W√ºrttembergische Landesbibliothek Stuttgart, 1999 The next English Bible translation was that of William Tyndale, whose Tyndale Bible had to be printed from 1525 outside England in areas of Germany sympathetic to Protestantism. Tyndale himself was sentenced to death at the stake because of his translation work. He was strangled in 1536 near Brussels and then burned.  From the printing press until the Reformation  Around 1440‚Äì1450 Johannes Gutenberg invented a printing press with movable type, with which he produced the Gutenberg Bible. His invention quickly spread throughout Europe. In 1466 the Mentelin Bible was the first vernacular language Bible to be printed. It was a word-for-word translation from the Latin Vulgate.

The Spanish Inquisition which they instituted ordered the destruction of all Hebrew books and all vernacular Bibles in 1497. This was five years after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain. In 1498, the Inquisition stated that it was impossible to translate the Bible into a modern language without making mistakes that would plunge unskilled and especially new converts into doubts about faith.

Ausgabe, Gebr√ºder Reichenbach, Leipzig 1840, p. 124 ‚ÄûBibelverbot‚Äú (Online-Version) The complete translation of the Bible into a Romance language, a transfer of the Vulgate into Valencian, was made by the Carthusian order general Bonifaci Ferrer (1355-1417) and was printed in 1478. A successor appeared again in 1790. By letter of March 17, 1479, Sixtus IV authorized the rector and dean of the University of Cologne to intervene with ecclesiastical censors against printers, buyers and readers of heretical books. This authorization was approved by Pope Alexander VI. In several theological and non-theological books from this period a printing patent is included in the publications. From this time also printing patents of the Patriarch of Venice can be found. With the censorship of January 4, 1486 and an executive order of January 10, the Elector-Archbishop Berthold von Henneberg of Mainz can be considered a pioneer in censorship regulation in the German-speaking countries for Mainz, Erfurt, and Frankfurt. His censorship decisions did not concern secular topics, but instead targeted specific religious texts, especially translations from Latin and Greek into the German. Berthold was of the opinion that the German language was too poor to reproduce the precise and well-formulated Latin and Greek texts. Up to this time, no heretical writings had appeared printed in German, but since 1466 about ten relatively identical German Bible translations were completed. He commented:Fremde R√§ume, Religionen und Rituale in Mandevilles ‚Ä∫Reisen‚Äπ: Wahrnehmung by Christina Henss, page 32 For every book translated into German, a license from certain university professors had to be obtained before distribution. Otherwise, one would be excommunicated, the books would be confiscated and one would have to pay a fine of 100 gold florins to the Elector-Archbishop. Due to a bull of Innocent VIII from the year 1486 there was also a censorship authority set up involving the university in Cologne and operated by an official of the archbishop. Alexander VI declared a preventive censorship with his bull of 1 June 1501. This extended to all the writings of the three religious electors Cologne, Mainz and Trier and the Archdiocese of Magdeburg, in which so many heretical books and treatises were printed. Pope Leo X determined during the Fifth Council of the Lateran on May 3, 1515, in the bull Inter Sollicitudines, that in all dioceses all books or writings to be printed had to be carefully examined and approved by the inquisitor, bishop, or a bishop commissioned by the bishop. In case of contravention, punishment would be the loss of the books by public burning, a fine of a hundred ducats payable to the protonotary apostolic in Rome, threatened with no hope of estate, deprivation of permission to write for a year, ex-communication, and potentially the confiscation of one's estate upon death. Recidivism (\\"if he is persistent\\") could be dealt with by the offender's bishop by all legal means as deterrence to others. In 1490 a number of Hebrew Bibles and other Jewish books were burned in Andaluc√≠a at the behest of the Spanish Inquisition.The Spanish Inquisition, Henry Kelsea, London, White Lion, 1965, p. 98  16th century  From 1516 to 1535, Erasmus of Rotterdam published several editions of his Novum Instrumentum omne. It was a double edition with both a new Latin version as well as the first print of the Greek text, which was reconstructed in a few places by back-translating Latin into Greek. In 1517 Luther published his Ninety-five Theses. In 1521 he was excommunicated with the bull Decet Romanum Pontificem, declared a heretic, and issued the Edict of Worms. In 1522, the first translation of Luther's New Testament was published. It was translated on the basis of the Greek text of Erasmus. In 1534 the entire Holy Scripture was printed, completing the Luther Bible. At the Council of Trent, both Luther's and Erasmus's writings were put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Later printed copies of the index explicitly banned their Bibles as well as any prior editions and in general all similar Bible editions.\\"Biblia+cum+recognitione+Martini+Luteri\\"&s; Index auctorum, et librorum, qui ab officio sanctae Rom. et vniuersalis by the Congregazione dell'Inquisizione, 1559 Testaments Index Librorum Prohibitorum ‚Äì NOV. TEST., 1559 The use of Erasmus's translation resulted in the abandonment of the Vulgate as a source for most future translations. Later, Erasmus was classified in a milder index class, and as a result later Catholic Bible translations were able to be based on Erasmus's Greek New Testament. The Edict of Worms against Luther was not enforced throughout the empire. In 1523, at the Reichstag in Nuremberg the papal nuncio Francesco Chieregati asked for the Holy Roman Empire to enforce the clause of the Lateran Council against printing any book without the permission of the local bishop or his representative. He also wanted the Edict of Worms to be enforced. Instead, on March 6, 1523, it was decreed that until the demanded church council could be held, local rulers themselves should ensure that no new writings were printed or sold in their territories unless they had been approved by reasonable men. Other writings, especially those of an insulting nature, were to be banned under severe punishment. Likewise, the Nuremberg Diet of 1524 determined that the imperial estates should \\"obey as much as possible\\" the Edict of Worms, and otherwise repeated the order of 1523. Pope Clement VII complained to the emperor and to the kings of England and France concerning the decision of 1523. In a letter dated July 15, 1524, Charles V insisted that the Edict of Worms was to be enforced. But he dropped this demand at the 1526 Diet of Speyer. Instead, it was decided on August 27 that, until the planned council, every imperial state in relation to the edict of Worms should \\"live, govern and behave for itself, such as it hopes and trusts before God and the Emperor.\\" The 1529 Diet of Speyer limited its decrees essentially to repeating the resolutions of 1523 Diet of Augsburg. On May 13, 1530, the papal nuncio gave the Emperor a memorandum which recommended that the Edict of Worms and the bull of Leo X was to be implemented by imperial decree and on pain of punishment. Following the Protestation at Speyer at the conclusion of the Reichstag on November 19, 1530, it was decided that nothing should be printed without specifying the printer and the printing location. The nuncio's request had failed. As part of the 1541 Diet of Regensburg which set the terms of the Regensburg Interim, the rule against publishing insults was repeated.  England  Henry VIII of England changed his opinion about Bible translations multiple times. In a proclamation of 1530, he said that the prelates, etc., believed there was no need to translate the Bible into English and put it into the hands of the ordinary people. The reading of Bible translations must be made dependent on the permission of the superiors. All printed English books concerning the Bible were banned and were to be delivered to the bishop within 14 days. New English books concerning Holy Scripture should not be printed without the permission of the bishop and the author. Yet after the danger of spreading heretical writings passes, the Bible ought to be translated. In the meantime, however, all English, French and Low German (including Dutch Low Saxon) versions must be delivered to the bishop, with the exception of any books corrected by the king and the bishops. The Tyndale translation, the only one so far printed, continued to be banned on the basis of translation errors, annotations, and extensive prologue. In 1534, the Canterbury Convocation requested that the king commission a new translation of the Bible by suitable persons and authorize the reading of the new translation. Although the king did not designate translators, new translations appeared from 1535 and afterwards. In 1536 and 1538 Thomas Cromwell prescribed that Coverdale's translation of the Bible was to be placed in every church. These Bibles were to be printed in a large size and chained to prevent theft. This translation came to be called the \\"Great Bible\\" or \\"Chained Bible.\\" In contrast, Henry VIII complained in 1539 that people were abusing their permission to read the Bible. Regulations of 1538 and 1539 provided that no one should sell English books without the King's permission and that no one should print or import English Bibles with comments and prefaces unless they have been verified by authorized agencies. In 1540, Thomas Cromwell was executed for heresy and treason. In 1542 the Convocation negotiated about the shortcomings of existing Bible translations and started a new translation. In 1543, the king again forbade the Tyndale Bible and ordered all annotations removed from all the Bibles and New Testaments. It was also determined that without the King's permission, the lower classes would no longer be allowed to read the even non- forbidden translations. The basis for this was that if allowed to read the Bible, they would end up abusing their privilege. In 1546, the last year of Henry VIII's reign, it was again decreed that no foreign-language English books concerning Christianity should be printed without express permission.  During reign of Mary I  In England, the provisions of the bull Inter Solicitudines (1515) under the reign of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I in the \\"Reformation Decrees\\" of the papal legate Cardinal Reginald Pole in 1556 were published. As various books of heresy, rebellion, and treachery were brought in from abroad and secretly printed in the land, in 1558 Mary I determined that owners of such books should be regarded as rebels and punished under the martial law.  Council of Trent  At the Council of Trent, the Vulgate was declared authentic and alone applicable.(Fourth session on April 8, 1546) It was also decided that in the future, books dealing with religious subjects could not be printed, sold, or even kept without the name of the author and the approval of a bishop. The imprimatur notice must be printed at the beginning of the book. Bishops may not charge fees for providing the services of examining and approving books. During the negotiations in March and April of 1546 it was also discussed whether it was not appropriate to ban Bible translations into the vernacular. Pierre Van Der Worst, bishop of Acqui thought that if the untrained were to read the Bible, it could easily give rise to misunderstandings and errors. He thought it would be enough for the women and ordinary people to become acquainted with the doctrines of Scripture through sermons at church. Cardinal Pedro Pacheco de Villena believed that all Spanish and French and most Italian bishops were against vernacular Bible translations. He referred to Spain's longstanding ban on translations, to the ban in France and to the fact that the University of Paris, which had 150 doctors, had not only spoken out against Bible translations, but also explained that the authors of such translations are like heretics because translations are a source of many heresies. In Germany, a part of the population had been brought to apostasy through vernacular translations. On the other hand, Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo of Trent replied that it was not the German translations of the Bible but the professors of the Greek and Hebrew languages who were to blame for the confusion. A ban would make the worst impression in Germany. In the end, no decision was reached on March 17th. Pacheco requested on April 1 to reject all ancient translations except the Vulgate, including the Septuagint and all Bible translations by heretics. Pietro Bertani, Bishop of Fano replied that the Church has always tolerated various translations and that even the heretical translations are not necessarily to be rejected, just as the early church did not reject the translations of Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion. Bartolom√© Carranza reported that many bishops and theologians spoke out in favor of allowing Bible translations. His argument in favor of vernacular translations came from the common practice in Spain and other countries to publicly read and preach from Gospels and epistles in the vernacular during festivals. As this had occurred without danger, why not also translate additional parts of the Bible? Yet still, it would be best not to translate the whole Bible. The majority of the members of the Council agreed with him. Similarly, the Paris Faculty of Theology expressed a similar opinion in 1526. As a result, Pacheco's claim was judged to be incorrect.  Index Librorum Prohibitorum  Around this time, the papal Index Librorum Prohibitorum began to be developed. At the 1548 Diet of Augsburg, which pronounced the terms of the Augsburg Interim, the ordinance against insults was repeated and the previous provisions were extended to include the name of the author or poet. In addition, books were to be checked before printing by the \\"ordinary authority of every place.\\" There was a sentiment against that which was \\"rebellious and ignominious or unruly or obnoxious to the Catholic Doctrine of the Holy Christian Church.\\" The already printed books of Luther were to be suppressed. The Holy Roman Imperial Fiscal official was to intervene against the offending authorities. After the 1555 Peace of Augsburg ended the Augsburg Interim and increased religious freedom by declaring cuius regio, eius religio, the papal Index Librorum Prohibitorum was only observed as law in Catholic territories.  The Netherlands  In the Netherlands up until 1550, Charles V issued a series of decrees intent on enforcing the 1521 Edict of Worms. He issued them by virtue of his sovereign power and did not refer to the decrees of the councils and popes. In contrast to his strictly secular method censorship, the Inquisition derived its ability to censor from papal authority. In addition to bans against individual authors and specific works, there was a language-related book ban against the translation of German, Flemish, and French heresies into Dutch issued in 1526. Some general works of heretics were allowed to appear if the name was not mentioned. Additionally, individuals were allowed to possess Luther's writings in order to refute them. During the reign of Philip II of Spain (son of Charles V), the laws were not significantly expanded, although they were confirmed and honed. During his time the possession or reading of forbidden books was sufficient evidence that one was a heretic. Such heretics were usually allowed to save themselves by abjuration if it was a first offense. Punishments could include consequences to \\"body or goods, according to circumstances\\" (1524), exile (1526), and the death penalty (1529, 1531). The prescribed method of execution differed by sex. Men had their heads placed on stakes following their beheading, while women were to be buried alive. Burning was only for recidivists. The list of banned books grew over time. Relatively short untitled lists were produced in 1526, 1529 and 1540. There are also historical references to a condemnation catalog issued by the University of Leuven faculty in 1546 and 1550. Parts of these earlier lists of banned books were later incorporated into Spanish banned book catalogs and in the Roman index. It was suggested that in dangerous times, the heretical books in the lists were better not to be read and should not be given to the common people and young people. One consideration was the risk of these lists inadvertently advertising which books were subversive. A list in the Netherlands omitted books not found in the Netherlands so as not to draw attention to them. In addition, there was also a directory of books that could be used at schools. As for the Bibles, it was noted in the catalog of 1546 that in some, especially in French and German translations, the meaning was corrupted by misinterpretation or by additions or omissions. Some theological writings from this period were faulted for only pretending to follow the Vulgate while actually adding things in from the Greek. With respect to other writings, it was asserted that although the translation was good, the printers had added bad prefaces, notes, and so on. At times, summaries of the individual chapters and marginal notes were asserted to have errors in them. The prohibited books catalog of 1546 contains 25 Latin Bibles and three Latin New Testaments, of German Bibles mostly the Antwerp editions, and two French Bibles as well as four French New Testaments from Antwerp. After a decree of April 29, 1550, lay people were forbidden to argue over the Scriptures. To preach concerning the Holy Scripture was only be granted to those authorized by the University or by the bishops. On September 25, an additional ordinance followed, saying that this prohibition would not apply to those who simply talked about Scripture according to the understanding of the church.  Spain  In Spain, the inquisitors were forbidden in 1549 to grant permission to own or read forbidden books. The inquisitors themselves were not to read the forbidden books in their possession. Pope Julius III issued a bull in 1550 which abolished all previously granted authorizations to read banned books. This bull was also published in Spain. The Spanish catalog of 1551, which was inspired by the Leuven catalog ordered by Charles V, included among other things a general prohibition on all Bibles translated into the Spanish or other vernacular languages.  France  In France, bans on certain books were published by the king or parliaments at the request of bishops or state- appointed inquisitors. Appraisals took over especially the Sorbonne. On March 18, 1521, at the request of the University of Paris, Francis I decreed that Parisian booksellers should not print new Latin or French books on the Christian faith before they had been examined by a theological faculty or deputies. On May 2, 1542, Parliament amended this regulation by stating that nothing should be printed without the approval of the Rector and the Dean, and that the Rector should appoint two members from each faculty to examine the writings concerned. In 1569, Bibles and religious books were subject to approval by four doctors. Containers of imported books were only to be opened under official supervision. Beginning in 1551 with the Edict of Ch√¢teaubriant, the import of religious books from Geneva or other places notoriously for heresy was forbidden. On August 26, 1525, the Sorbonne, at Parliament's request, declared that a Bible translation used for the Horae Beatae Virginis Mariae of Mere sotte would not receive a printing permit. In accordance with earlier decisions of the faculty, it was decided on February 5, 1526 that it would be dangerous at all to publish translations of the Bible or biblical books and those already published should be better suppressed than tolerated. A rare exception was the Sorbonne's permission for a Pauline-related gospel work in 1530, which was translated from Latin into French. From 1543 to 1556 there was a catalog of banned books at the Sorbonne. Later on, every bookstore was required to have a copy of this catalog available. There was also a general remark in the catalog: How dangerous it was to allow Bible translations in the vernacular to be read even by uneducated people and those who did not read them with a pious and humble spirit, as there were many now Waldenses, Albigensians, etc. Therefore, considering the malice of the people in the present, the translation of the Bible into the vernacular should be regarded as dangerous and perishable. The later Roman index was never used in France and an intended French index dating from 1562 was ultimately not published due to theEdict of Beaulieu of Henry III. In 1577 the provisions were changed in favor of the Protestants: \\"No books may be sold without permission of our local officials or, as far as the so-called Reformed religion books are concerned, without the approval of the Chambers which we hold in the parliaments for the affairs of the form so-called Reformed. Forbidden is the printing and distribution of defamatory libels.\\" From the 16th through 18th centuries, a Bible smuggler's path led from Passau to the Slovenian border and Arnoldstein in Austria. Cattle drivers and dealers, merchants, and carters brought Bibles and hymnals into Austria, where they were used by Crypto-Protestants.  General Rules in the Roman Index  Pius IV (pontificate 1559‚Äì1565) also added general rules to the Index Romanus. In the first printed and published version of 1559, there are 30 Latin editions of Scripture, 10 New Testament editions, and two short general rules for Bibles in foreign languages. At the 18th meeting of the Council of Trent on 26 February 1562, it was decided to work out general indexing rules. On December 3rd or 4th, 1563, the Council decided to submit its proposal, the Decretum de indice librorum, to the Pope for final adaptation. With the bull Dominici gregis custodiae the Index tridentinus was published on March 24, 1564 by the Pope. In it all the writings of all heresiarchs (all Reformers) were included on the index, regardless of whether they contained theology, religious words, or descriptions of nature. Especially on Bibles, Rules 3 and 4 came into play: The rules were reprinted in each version until the reform in 1758. Believers were forbidden to make, read, own, buy, sell or give away these books on the basis of excommunication. Hubert Wolf: Index: der Vatikan und die verbotenen B√ºcher, C.H.Beck, 2007, , p. 27‚Äì34, 218 pages At the Diet of Speyer in 1570, it was decreed that every printer should be sworn in on the Reichstag regulations. A similar provision can be found in the Reich Police Order (Reichspolizei-Ordnung) of 1577, however, \\"nothing unruly and obscenely should be printed,\\" according to the Christian general doctrine and the religious peace called for at Augsburg. Sixtus V (pontificate 1585‚Äì1590) replaced the general rules of the Index Romanus. In its seventh rule it stated: Clement VIII confirmed in a bull of October 17, 1595, in principle, the old general rules, but made the fourth rule more restrictive by adding to it. This restored the provision of Paul IV that dispensation could only be granted on behalf of the Pope or the Roman Inquisition: With this addition, the rule remained valid until 1758. How it was dealt with in each country was different. In a Catholic country like Bavaria, it was state law. In particular, booksellers had their licenses revoked for violating it. In contrast, in W√ºrttemberg, a refuge of Protestantism, the index functioned more like a blacklist. But it also found application in elite Catholic schools in secularized France until the 20th century. In general, secularized France almost never used the Roman Index.

In a bull dated December 30, 1622, Pope Gregory XV forbade the laity to read vernacular Bible translations. Alexander VII (pontificate 1655-1667) insisted on the fourth rule in his 1664 index and added all Bible translations - in whatever language - to the index. However, according to another interpretation, he only confirmed the fourth rule.  Unigenitus  In 1713 Clement XI issued the bull Unigenitus dei filius in order to fight against Jansenism. The bull condemned 101 excerpts from the work R√©flexions morales by Pasquier Quesnel, including the following propositions: Philip Schaff: Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes. Volume I. The History of Creeds., 1919; ¬ß 27\\\\. The Papal Bulls against the Jansenists, 1653 and 1713. This bull was controversial among the French clergy for various reasons. Among the reasons it was controversial was that it condemned various sentences from the Bible and the Fathers of the Church. But the 1719 bull Pastoralis officii threatened excommunication on all who did not submit to Unigenitus dei filius.Ott, Michael. \\"Unigenitus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 3 June 2017 At the Lateran Council confirmed Benedict XIII. in 1725 the bull Unigenitus dei filius.  Developments in the Index Later all paraphrases, summaries, and \\"biblical stories\\" were banned in the vernacular languages. In the eighteenth century, attempts were made to move away from individual dispensations; now, any Bible translation approved by a competent ecclesiastical authority should generally be considered as lawful for all laymen. This broad interpretation of the fourth index rule was followed in 1757 by Benedict XIV. (This lasted until 1836.) A later regulation of the Roman book censorship of 1757 permitted only translations with explanatory notes taken from the Fathers of the Church and with papal approval.  Punishments against violators  As part of a program of persecution against the Salzburg Protestants, in 1731, Leopold Anton von Firmian ‚Äì Archbishop of Salzburg as well as its temporal ruler as Count, ordered the wholesale seizure and burning of all Protestant books and Bibles.Catholics Cleanse Salzburg of Protestants On May 27, 1747 Jakob Schmidlin (\\"Sulzijoggi\\") was hanged as the leading head of a Bible movement in the canton of Lucerne in Galgenw√§ldli on the Emme. His corpse was burned along with a Luther Bible. He is considered the last Protestant martyr of Switzerland. Where his farm stood, a pillar was erected. Of over 100 co-defendants of this movement (from Ruswil, Wolhusen, Werthenstein, Menznau, Malters, Kriens, and Udligenswil), 82 of them were also punished, mostly with perpetual banishment. Since the Bible was at the center of this movement and violations of censorship rules against the use and possession of Bibles was one of the offenses committed by the convicted, after the trial the authorities issued a decree that included a general prohibition on laymen having Bibles: Only after 1833 were Bibles were regularly and openly sold in Lucerne.  Italian and Spanish translations  Pope Clement XIII allowed for the use of Italian translations of the Bible during his pontificate, which spanned 1758-1769. The second Spanish Bible translation appeared in 1790.  19th‚Äì20th centuries  Pius VII forbade in two breves to the Archbishop of Gniezno and Primate of all Poland (June 29, 1816) and to the Archbishop of Mohilev (September 3) the use of the Polish Bible, which had been published in 1599 in Krakow with the permission of Clement VIII. It says: The Epistola encyclica of May 3, 1824 by Leo XII also did not exhibit any liberal attitudes. In 1836, Gregory XVI eliminated the relief made back in 1757. His encyclical letter Inter praecipuas of 1844 spoke out against vernacular Bibles of the Bible societies. Since the dawn of Christianity, the trick of heretics has been to falsify the wording of Scripture and distort it by interpretation. \\"Therefore, there is a deep wisdom in the previous Catholic practice to forbid the independent reading of the Bible in the vernacular to laymen, or only to allow it with considerable caution, because they ultimately threaten to undermine the teaching authority of the Church.\\" Hans-Josef Klauck: Religion und Gesellschaft im fr√ºhen Christentum. Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament 152, Mohr Siebeck, 2003, , p. 361 Pius IX spoke in 1846 his entry-level encyclical Qui pluribus. He warned against \\"the most impudent Bible societies, which renewed the ancient artifice of the heretics and translated the books of the Divine Scriptures, contrary to the most sacrosanct rules of the Church, into all national languages and often provided twisted explanations.\\" William Herman Theodore Dau: Luther Examined and Reexamined: A Review of Catholic Criticism and a Plea for Revaluation, St. Louis, Missouri: Concordia Publishing House: 1917, page 68 The situation in Nice was very different from the situation in the Duchy of Tuscany. The duchy had a reputation for being liberal during the rule of Leopold II, even prior to 1849. There were three Protestant churches within the duchy: one English, one Scottish and one French. The French Protestant church held fairs in the Italian language. After the brief period during the republic the subsequent counter-revolution, the liberal climate changed to conservative. On May 18, 1849, 3,000 copies of a Catholic Italian translation of the Bible were confiscated and burned under the orders of Antonio Martini, the Archbishop of Florence, even though they had been printed with permission. Persecution of Protestants increased. In 1851, services in Italian were outlawed. The possession of a Protestant Italian Bible alone was considered sufficient evidence for conviction. The most prominent prisoner was Count Piero Guicciardini, who was arrested with six others. They had met on May 7, 1851, the day before his voluntary departure for religious exile, and read the Scriptures together. He was therefore sentenced to six months imprisonment for blasphemy, which was then converted into exile. Samuel Waldegrave: Italien (Aus einer Rede des Herrn Sam. Waldegrave, zu Bedford 9.

In the Austrian Empire, the Patent of Toleration was published on October 13, 1781. In addition, on June 22, 1782, and October 12, 1782, Joseph II issued court decrees explicitly authorizing the import and printing of Protestant books and stipulating that previously confiscated publications should be returned as long as they were not abusive towards the Catholic Church.

In 1854 in Buda the police seized 121 Bibles found in a Protestant congregation and reduced 120 of them to pulp in a paper mill. In return the congregation was given 21 kreuzers due to the value of the books as pulp as well as the one remaining Bible, \\"which is enough for the pastor.\\" August Nathanael B√∂hner (Mitglied der Schweizerischen Naturforschenden Gesellschaft): Naturforschung und Kulturleben.

On December 7, 1859, in front of the Archbishop's Palace in Santa Fe de Bogot√° in the then Granadine Confederation a great bible burning took place.

The first issue with annotations from 1820 was added to the Index of Prohibited Books. Another example of an author who violated Officiorum ac Munerum is Franz Stephan Griese, who in 1919 printed without permission The Letters of St. Paul (which contained his translation of the letters) in Paderborn, Germany. Although he was banned from publishing following this transgression, in 1923 without his knowledge, his Pauline letters were published by someone else, complete with ecclesiastical permission of the Archdiocese of Cologne!  Brittany  The first New Testament translation into Breton was published in 1827 by Protestants after the Catholic Church refused its publication. The translation was placed on the Index. However, the Old Testament was completed by the Catholic diocesan publisher and printed in 1866.  United States  In 1827 in New York, 116 pages of The Book of Mormon, had been lost under peculiar circumstances and are presumed to be destroyed. Joseph Smith intended the book to be a companion to the King James version of the Bible. On July 20, 1833, a mob destroyed a printing press owned by a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, partly thought to be in retaliation for its use in printing portions of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible for a Church paper. The text had extensive additions that had never been seen before. In 1842, a Jesuit Priest named Telman was responsible for the burning of a number of \\"Protestant\\" Bibles in Champlain, New York.  Nazi Germany  In late August 1933, authorities used 25 trucks to transport about 70 tonnes of Watch Tower literature and Bibles to the city's outskirts and publicly burned them as part of a larger program of Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany. Later on, in July 1935, state governments were instructed in July 1935 to confiscate all Watch Tower Society publications, including Bibles. On November 9 and 10, 1938, thousands of Hebrew Bibles were burned in multiple communities in Germany as part of a program of persecution against Jews.Why Did the Nazis Burn the Hebrew Bible?

The Jehovah's Witnesses successfully sued in response.  China  When the economic reforms implemented by Deng Xiaoping created greater openness to the West, Christians of various affiliations began smuggling Bibles and Christian literature into China. The CCP viewed the recipients of those Bibles as engaging in illegal activity in violation of the principle of not accepting aid from Western sources.Spiegel, Mickey (2004), \\"Control and Containment in the Reform Era\\", in Kindopp, Jason; Hamrin, Carol Lee, God and Caesar in China: Policy Implications of Church-State Tensions, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 51‚Äì52. Acts 2:14‚Äì17  Taiwan  For two years in the 1950s, churches were banned from using Chinese Bibles written with Latin letters instead of Chinese characters. The ban was lifted with an encouragement to use Chinese characters. A 1973 Taiwanese translation of the New Testament was the product of cooperation between Protestants and Catholics. It was confiscated in 1975, also for using Latin letters.The Presbyterian Church in Taiwan and the Advocacy of Local Autonomy, page 6 of the document, page 22 of the pdf  Russia, Estonia and Latvia  In Russia, the activities of the Bible Society in Russia were greatly limited after Czar Nicholas I placed the society under the control of Orthodox church authorities. Following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, no Bibles were published until 1956, and even then the circulation was limited until the 1990s.History of The Bible Society in Russia, in Russian Aldis Purs, wrote that in Estonia as well as Latvia, some evangelical Christian clergy attempted to resist the Soviet policy of state atheism by engaging in anti-regime activities such as Bible smuggling.  21st century   Islamic states  In some, mostly Muslim states, censorship of the Bible exists today, such as in Saudi Arabia where the distribution of non-Muslim religious materials such as Bibles is illegal, although non-Muslims are permitted to own their own Bibles. For example, Sadeq Mallallah was accused of smuggling a Bible by a judge prior to his beheading.  Malaysia  The Prime Minister clarified in April 2005 that there was no ban on Bibles translated into Malay, although they are required to be stamped with a disclaimer \\"Not for Muslims\\"Bahasa Malaysia bibles not for Muslims|Spero News The word translated in English as \\"God\\" is translated as \\"Allah\\" in some Malay Bibles, which is illegal as non-Muslims are prohibited from using the term \\"Allah.\\" In March 2010, the Malaysian Home Ministry seized 30,000 Malay language bibles from a port in Kuching, Sarawak.Christians say fed up with Najib administration A lawsuit was filed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur against the Government of Malaysia at the High Court of Malaya to seek a declaratory relief that the word \\"Allah\\" should not exclusive to Islam.

Eventually, it was explained to the government that there was no other comparable term in Iban. As such, the ban was not enforced further, although neither was it officially repealed. However, following the 2014 court ruling 16 Iban language Bibles were seized on the basis they illegally contained the term \\"Allah Taala.\\"  Uzbekistan  The government of Uzbekistan may confiscate and in some cases destroy illegally imported religious literature. In July 2006 the Customs Service detained a shipment of 500 Russian-language Bibles and other literature that had been shipped to the Jehovah's Witnesses congregation in Chirchik, and charged them for storing it. Following a raid on an unregistered Baptist church in Karshi on August 27, 2006, a court ordered the burning of seized Christian literature, including a Bible, hymnbooks, and multiple copies of the Old Testament Book of Proverbs in Uzbek.  U.S. military  In 2009 the U.S. military burned Bibles in the Pashto and Dari languages, which were seemingly intended for distribution among the locals, which is in breach of regulations which forbid \\"proselytizing of any religion, faith or practice\\".  U.S. schools  Likewise, when the use of the Bible by staff in U.S. public schools was restricted (along with teacher-led prayers), this prohibition was also commonly referred to as a \\"Bible ban\\".  Bible smugglers  Censorship of the Bible has met with resistance from groups such as Open Doors, Voice of the Martyrs, and World Help, which supply Bibles for smuggling or directly smuggle the Bibles themselves into lands where the Bibles or their distribution are prohibited. Individual Bible smugglers include Andrew van der Bijl, David Hathaway, and John White.  Canon 825 of the Catholic Church  Today Canon 825 governs Catholic Bible translations:Code of Canon Law, canon 825  Russia  In 2015, Russia banned importation of the Jehovah's Witnesses' New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.Customs Officials Block Bibles From Entering Russia Official Website of Jehovah's Witnesses, retrieved 30 March 2016. On May 5, 2015, customs authorities in Russia seized a shipment of religious literature containing Ossetian-language Bibles published by Jehovah's Witnesses. Russian customs officials in the city of Vyborg held up a shipment of 2,013 Russian- language copies of Bibles on July 13, 2015. Customs authorities confiscated three of the Bibles, sent them to an \\"expert\\" to study the Bibles to determine whether they contained \\"extremist\\" language, and impounded the rest of the shipment.  China  The state-owned Amity Press is the only publisher allowed to print Bibles in China that are not for export. The quantity printed is restricted, and the sale or distribution of Bibles is limited to officially sanctioned churches, with online sales having been recently cracked down upon. The Associated Press reported in September 2018 that the current suppression program in China includes the burning of Bibles. Singapore Singapore has banned Bibles and other literature published by the publishing arms of the Jehovah's Witnesses. A person in possession of banned literature can be fined up to S$2,000 (US$1,333) and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction. In February 1995, Singapore police seized Bibles during a raid and arrested 69 Jehovah's Witnesses, many of whom went to jail. In March 1995, 74-year-old Yu Nguk Ding was arrested for carrying two \\"undesirable publications\\"‚Äîone of them a Bible printed by the Watch Tower Society.  Vietnam  Due to persecution by the government against the Montagnard ethnic minority in Vietnam today, death is a possible consequence of getting caught with a Bible.

It was designed by John Thomas Kelleher and J. R. Brown of the colonial Department of Public Works and built in 1886. The entire building was added to the Victorian Heritage Register on 20 August 1982, with the federally-owned post office wing also being listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  The Traralgon court house and post office complex was designed by Department of Public Works' architect J. T. Kelleher and constructed in 1886. It also included Colonial government offices in the form of a sub-treasury. Prior to this, the region's mail services and the Court of Petty Sessions had operated variously from the rear of the Traralgon Hotel (formerly Campbell's Traveller's Rest) and Kate Campbell's residence in Kay Street. The operation of postal services from the new postal building was commenced in May 1887. When it opened, the main entrance to the post office complex was from Kay Street with a full length counter. Living quarters for the Post Master were above the post office, with the private entrance also being in Kay Street. Folding stairs in an ante-room provided access to the platform surrounding the clock tower, from which views of the town and surrounds could be obtained. The installation of the clock in the tower in 1892 was the achievement of the local Progress Association. and a telephone exchange was installed in 1920. The Kay Street loggia was enlarged 1920 by extending northwards to Kay Street; this arrangement included single door openings from both Kay and Franklin Streets. This work probably involved the installation of a new counter area between the former loggia space and post office, internalising a public space for postal transactions. A ground floor window opening in the Franklin Street elevation (adjacent to the projecting bay) had been converted to provide a door opening by 1925. The picket fence had been removed from the court house frontage by 1940, and The clock faces were lit in 1948. Major works to the post office wing in 1965-66 included the relocation of main entrance to Franklin Street centre bay. These works involved demolition of the central pair of ground floor windows and construction of a door opening with a pair of aluminium- framed doors, curved steel-framed awning and concrete access ramps. Other major works included the complete demolition of the original rear quarters wing and construction of a large mail room wing with loggia facing Kay Street containing multiple banks of private letter boxes and public telephone booths. Other works included brick infill to original and 1920s door openings in corner bay; overpainting of rendered dressings; replacement of original slate roofing with corrugated galvanised steel; removing gablet vents and replacement of original clock mechanism with electric drive. The clock hands were replaced with stronger hands and the Roman figures repainted in 1982-85. Electric chimes were installed in the clock in 1994. The Traralgon Magistrates' Court was abolished from December 1989, with single-court local courts having increasingly fallen out of favour; it was replaced with a multi- court regional Magistrates' Court, initially based in Moe. The courthouse wing sat vacant for several years until it briefly reopened as a court for the Family Court of Australia in 1993, after which it again sat vacant. In 1995, a Delivery Centre was established off-site and the 1960s mail centre wing was converted to a separate tenancy. The post office was refurbished throughout the ground floor areas. Refurbishment works included ceramic tiling of public space, recarpeting, new display systems, new counter joinery, installation of plasterboard ceilings and cornices, new lighting. Works to the first floor appear to be limited to the provision of a small kitchenette in the former lunch and meeting room. The \\"Friends of Traralgon Court House\\" community group was named caretakers of the vacant courthouse wing in 2017, after which the section underwent further repairs in 2017-18, including the repair of a leaking roof which was inhibiting its potential use. It was reported in 2018 that the group aimed to refurbish the courthouse as a community space, while the City of Latrobe hoped to use a later addition to the courthouse wing for commercial purposes. In 2019, the Friends of Traralgon Court House organised an exhibition in the courthouse wing for Anzac Day.  Description  Traralgon Post Office and Court House is at 161-169 Franklin Street, Traralgon, comprising the whole of Lot 1D/2/3647. The post office is on a nearly flat site at the corner of Kay and Franklin Streets. This is the primary administrative street in Traralgon, though the two main roads through the city are Tyers Road, one block north, and Princes Street, three blocks to the south. In Kay Street the post office site is diagonally opposite the Shire and City offices, and the post office fronts a roadside park to the immediate north. The title, which was originally rectangular, is now essentially L-shaped which reflects the subdivision of the post office and courthouse components. The central mass is symmetrical on the three street sides, with a mansarded clock tower and a platform roof immediately behind it, framed with a cast iron balustrade as a widow's walk. The clock tower is clad with pressed metal sheet, which makes it read as distinct from the rest of the building. The tower has angled corner buttresses and the clock faces are placed as dormers directly in front of the mansard, both these elements heightening the mansard's baroque referencing. Each clock face has a small pyramidal finial. The roof is clad in slate tile with galvanised iron ridge capping, and supported by a weighty bracketed timber cornice above tuckpointed salmon- coloured face brick walls. The east elevation, facing Franklin Street, is marked by a breakfront with a finialled pediment above it. The tympanum is vigorously ornamented in a floral pattern with a central circular vent and surmounted by a continuing line of cornice brackets. The main windows facing the street are all double-hung sashes in stilted round arches, the arches being picked out at the keystone and springing points with accentuated dressings. These act to give the arches a pointed impression, hinting at the Florentine combination of pointed over round arches. Each storey has two prominent moulded string courses and a substantial base battered out from the wall in several steps. This is accentuated by a projecting panel under each upper side window facing Franklin Street, and by a further breakfront over the Franklin Street entrance, topped with urns - a favourite early device in Queen Anne free style usage. The main entrance bay is a conversion of an original window bay, associated with the reorientation of the interior in the 1960s which included a steel-framed awning, concrete ramps and aluminium-framed doors. All ground floor windows were supported on recessed spandrels originally, giving the impression of full-height windows. One of the upstairs windows, facing south toward Seymour Street, has been left blind. The original double-storey north elevation of the main building is fronted by a single- storey, double-fronted bay; the present form, dating from the 1920s, replaced the original arcaded loggia. The 1920s pattern of fenestration included a single arched door opening to Franklin Street and three arched window openings and a door opening to Kay Street; the two door openings have since been converted to windows. The bay has a parapeted flat roof, fronted with a balustrade of miniature ovals outlined in rendered cement and interspersed with piers topped with urns. A generally similar treatment tops the still open loggia connecting the post office to the neighbouring courthouse. The 1960s Kay Street wing is almost fully glazed with non-original shopfront glazing to the street and has an additional pavilion at its west end facing a right of way. This wing contains a retail tenancy with timber-framed partitions but was originally a single large volume. At the rear of this transverse part is a 1960s amenities wing, linked to the main post office by a rear verandah. This is a later addition with louvred windows and several lean-to extensions in brick, framing a concreted courtyard with a large roll-a-door loading bay behind the post office retail area. The courthouse itself is a rectangular, temple-like, single-storey mass behind its Franklin Street loggia, with a floral ornamented pediment and exposed brick walls similar to those of the post office. There are two levels to the main postal section, and one to the original loggia wing, rear wing and court house.  Condition  Despite a number of phases of change to the external form of the building, including the enlargement of the Kay Street loggia wing in the 1920s, the replacement of the original quarters wing in the 1960s, and reorientation of the main entrance, the external integrity of the original post office and associated courthouse complex is very good. Internally, the intactness of the original form and fabric has been substantially compromised by a number of changes to the program and extensive refurbishment. The overall condition of the building appears generally sound and reasonably well maintained, with the exception of damp which is evident in the post office public hall. There are a small number of sections of brickwork which require repointing.  Heritage listing  Traralgon Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 with the following rationale: Traralgon Post Office, constructed in 1886 as a combined court house, post office and sub-treasury complex, has been of considerable historical importance to Traralgon, a major regional centre of the Latrobe Valley in eastern Victoria. The scale and quality of the post office and court house complex, with its inherent landmark qualities and key siting, emphasises the significant role of Traralgon as the communications and administrative centre of the region during the 1880s and after. Traralgon Post Office has an uncommon multiplicity of functions and is one of a small group of post and telegraph offices and residence which was combined with a court house, Colonial offices and sub-treasury. Despite a number of alterations and phases of refurbishment, the original composition is still highly evident externally, including the distinct building components. Typologically, and although subject to some alteration, Traralgon Post Office remains an uncommon example of a composite public service building with a range of original functions including an integrated court house. While the separate building components are conceived as distinct units, they are also unified by the common use of overall building form and detail, frontal loggias and integrated planning. Stylistically, the Traralgon Post Office complex is a large scale and flamboyant transitional design combining rich Victorian detailing fused with the freer language of Federation Queen Anne and Romanesque styles. Architecturally, Traralgon Post Office is an example of the Public Works Department architects, J. R. Brown and J. T. Kelleher. The liberated design is characteristic of the transitional and varied approach of the Department, following the departure of William Wardell and marking the lead up to the Federation period. Traralgon Post Office is an excellent example of a large-scale public building complex in the Late Victorian Italianate style fused with transitional free-Romanesque and Queen Anne characteristics, typical of the Federation period. It is one of, if not the most, prominent nineteenth century elements in the central Traralgon streetscape and, as such, forms a widely-known regional landmark. Traralgon Post Office gains aesthetic weight from a very well handled meshing of integrated, yet distinct, functions into a finely composed asymmetrical design. This is further enhanced by the complex fusion of layers of Victorian Italianate with free-Romanesque and Queen Anne form and details. Traralgon Post Office has been a key and prominent component of the historic townscape for 120 years and is a widely known symbol which is identified with the town's development and prospective future. The post office building is also locally valued for its combination of public and administrative functions, within a richly detailed building of high architectural and aesthetic value. The curtilage includes the title block/allotment of the property. The significant components of Traralgon Post Office include the main postal building of 1886 and the extension of the loggia to Kay Street undertaken in the 1920s.

He was captured following the conflict ending Battle of Alamance on May 16, 1771, and shortly thereafter ordered to be executed as a rebel and traitor by Colonial Governor William Tryon. Personal life Merrill was born circa 1731 in Hopewell, New Jersey. He became a gunsmith and plantation owner. His lands included a river with a strong current \\"...sufficient to power the machinery used in boring out the barrels.\\" His residence was located four miles south of Lexington, North Carolina, in what was then Orange County. It was reported that Merrill was a deacon of the nearby Jersey church, a Baptist congregation founded about 1755 by settlers from New Jersey.Rowan County; North Carolina Counties; accessed Aug 2018 He was married to Jemima Smith, daughter of Andrew Smith of Hopewel, and was known to have had eight to ten children.NOTE: Although Elder H. Sheets noted that his wife's maiden name could not be ascertained. Regulator movement The Regulation movement (or \\"War of the Regulation\\") was at first a low intensity action carried on by colonists from about 1765 to 1771 against local and state officials and offices in the Carolinas. The colonials had become upset over issues of what some considered unfair taxation, local government corruption, and local government control. At first, the colonial governments did little to intercede; but by early 1771, North Carolina Governor Tryon had had enough, now viewing the perpetrators as full fledged rebels.Prelude to the American Revolution? The War of Regulation: A Revolutionary Reaction for Reform; Sarah Sadlier; Charles Wright Academy, Tacoma, Washington; (2012); PDF format file, accessed March 8, 2019. Governor Tryon sent General Hugh Waddell through Rowan and Mecklenburg to raise troops. Waddell enlisted almost one hundred in Mecklenburg and about the same number in Rowan. At this time, Captain Merrill had also rallied a company of three hundred men, most of whom were Baptists, from the Jersey Settlement (in what is now Davidson County). From here Captain Merrill marched to meet other Regulator forces, who were convinced an overwhelming show of force would intimidate the government forces into withdrawal, rather than to actually fight. The Regulator militia was gathering a large force at a camp site along the Alamance Creek. Alamance On May 9, when marching to join Tryon, Waddell was intercepted at the Yadkin by the much larger force of Regulators under Merrill. Realizing his force was outnumbered, Waddell fell back to the Salisbury District. He was unable to join the governor until after the battle. Meanwhile Tryon had proceeded westward from Hillsborough with just under eleven hundred men. He met the forces of the insurgents at Alamance Creek and defeated them, thereby bringing open opposition of the Regulators to an end. Captain Merrill arrived after the battle had been decided; his force was scattered and he was taken prisoner. The Battle of Alamance was the only full- scale‚Äîand the decisive battle‚Äîof the war.Brown, Richard Maxwell; The South Carolina Regulators: The Story of the First American Vigilante Movement; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Belknap Press of Harvard University; (1963) Battle aftermath James Pugh, Robert Matear, Benjamin Merrill, Captain Messer, and two others whose names are now unknown. \\"Our blood will be as good seed in good ground, that will soon produce one hundred fold.\\" ‚ÄìJames Pugh, under the gallows at Hillsboro, N.C., June 19th, 1771.\\" From May 30 to June 20, 1771, the court of oyer and terminer was held at Hillsborough for the trial of the Regulators captured at Alamance.

It first appeared in the fifth century, and was influential from the eighth to tenth centuries during the Tang dynasty. It was not a structured philosophical school; it was identified and named by the Daodejing commentator Du Guangting (ÊùúÂÖâÂ∫≠, 850-933).Daodezhenjing guangshengyi ÈÅìÂæ∑ÁúüÁ∂ìÂª£ËÅñÁæ© .Livia Kohn, Daoist Mystical Philosophy: The Scripture of Western Ascension p 181-188 Chongxuan's most important representatives were Cheng Xuanying (ÊàêÁéÑËã±, fl. 631-655) and Li Rong (ÊùéÊ¶Æ), both from the seventh century CE. Chongxuan is also an appellation of the immortal embryo in internal alchemy,Fabrizio Pregado ed. Encyclopedia of Taoism, 200, Routledge, p24-25 or Neidan, reflecting some influence of Chongxuan thought on Neidan.Livia Kohn Taoism Handbook, 2000, Brill, p17  Thought  The Chongxuan authors continue the interpretation of a Daodejing phrase first used by the Xuanxue exegetical school, \\"mysterious and again mysterious\\".ÁéÑ‰πãÂèàÁéÑ The Xuanxue thinkers deduced from this phrase the infinite depth, hence the transcendence of the Dao, and its empty nature (w√∫ ÁÑ°). The Chongxuan school, inspired by the Madhyamaka thought of the Sanlun SchoolSchool of the \\"Three Treatises\\": Shatika ≈õƒÅstra „ÄäÁôæË´ñ„Äã, Madhyamika ≈õƒÅstra„Ää‰∏≠Ë´ñ„Äã and Dvadashamukha ≈õƒÅstra„ÄäÂçÅ‰∫åÈñÄË´ñ„Äã and the Buddhist philosopher and monk Jizang, considered the phrase to mean that there are two stages to attaining the Dao: first, to get rid of the mental illusion of being, and then that of nonbeing. A similar phrase in Daodejing chapter 48, \\"diminish and again diminish\\",Êêç‰πãÂèàÊêç is interpreted as meaning the erasure of desire in two stages: first, to eradicate desire, and then to eradicate the ultimate desire of wanting to have no desires. In practice, Jizang's \\"forgetfulness in two steps\\" (jiƒÅnw√†ng ÂÖºÂøò) will be accomplished; this inspired the Shangqing patriarch Sima Chengzhen's seven-step yoga of the Zuowanglun.ÂùêÂøòË´ñ, see Livia Kohn Taoism Handbook, 2000, Brill, p46 Similarity to MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and the soteriology of the Lingbao School is also found in some Chongxuan authors' idea that after the sage completes their spiritual path for their own benefit, they must benefit others. On the other hand, Chongxuan thinkers also relied on the Zhuangzi, many of whose passages center around the overcoming of conceptual oppositions. Cheng Xuanying's commentary to the Zhuangzi is of great importance here.Harold Roth Zhuangzi, 2001, \\"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\" Active at a time when the Tang state had great influence over and gave patronage to Daoist teachings, Chongxuan thinkers generally admitted the existence of social and spiritual inequality between humans, which they explain as divergence on the part of the Dao or Taiyi universal force received at birth, and by the interplay of qi, both of which depended on circumstances. This point of view already existed with Guo Xiang. On the level of chances for the advancement of spiritual progress, they distinguished brilliant minds who quickly reached the Dao, and lesser minds which needed to be guided step-by- step by a master. In politics, Chongxuan thinkers advocated a wuwei philosophy for the sovereign.  Authors  Apart from Cheng Xuanying and Li Rong, the following people are also mentioned as Chongxuan thinkers: Sun Deng Â≠´Áôª (third century), Meng Zhizhou Â≠üÊô∫Âë® and Zang Xuanjing ËáßÁéÑÈùú (fifth century), Zhu Rou Ë´∏Á≥Ö and Liu Jinxi ÂäâÈÄ≤Âñú (sixth century), Cai Zihuang Ëî°Â≠êÊôÉ, Che Xuanbi ËªäÁéÑÂºº, Zhang Huichao ÂºµÊÉ†Ë∂Ö, and Li Yuanxing ÈªéÂÖÉËàà (Tang dynasty), and Shao Ruoyu ÈÇµËã•ÊÑö and Dong Sijing Ëë£ÊÄùÈùñ (twelfth century).

The term is used metaphorically where \\"the woodshed\\" means any private place to practice without being heard by anyone else. This is based on the assumption that an actual woodshed would likely be in a remote location, away from the main house. In jazz music In jazz lingo, woodshedding is often shortened to 'shed or 'shedding. According to Paul Klemperer, a Texas-based jazz educator, woodshedding is more than just practicing‚Äî it is \\"the place where you work out the techniques that form the foundation of your improvisational ability\\". In barbershop singing In barbershop music, woodshedding can mean starting only with a melody and working out harmonies by ear without benefit of notated music. Other uses In legal parlance, \\"woodshedding\\" refers to the instruction given to a witness to make him respond in one party's favor. It is the act of impermissibly coaching a witness or unfairly prejudicing him during ex parte communications. This fits with the concept of the metaphor of a \\"woodshed\\" being a private place where such conspiracy might occur. It is also called \\"horse shedding\\" and involves practice questions and answers or even a mock trial. Such tactics can have an impact on a witness's memory, which is malleable and suggestible.

The station opened in 1878 and closed to passengers in 1951, although the line remained open for a further 18 years for diversions and goods traffic. History The station was on the western edge of Kippax village adjacent to the hamlet of Great Preston. Like all the other stations on the line, it had just one platform on the eastern side of the line. The station opened to passengers in August 1878, but had opened to goods traffic four months earlier. As with other sections of the line, the station did not possess a passing loop, though trains could pass in the freight loop that led into the goods yard. In 1880, the station's water tower was used to supply fresh water to the people living in and around the station area (Great Preston). An outbreak of fever, diphtheria and diarrhoea in previous years had led to the railway company providing fresher water than that already afforded to the locals. The tower, which was situated on the main platform, was not fitted with an apparatus to transfer water to locomotives. The station had a goods shed to the south of the platform; its design was the same as the one provided at . The chief export from Kippax was aggregate; a local quarry had a siding just to the north of the station. Kippax was the busiest station on the line as it served a larger and well established village. In 1911, 44,000 tickets were issued compared to Ledston's 15,000. The station closed to passengers in January 1951, with closure to goods in September 1963. No trace of the station remains, though the trackbed has been converted into a cycleway.

Jameson is an Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois. She works on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantum chemistry. Jameson dedicated her academic career to supporting women scientists. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Early life and education  Jameson was born in the Philippines. She completed her bachelor's degree in chemistry at the University of the Philippines in 1958. She graduated magna cum laude. She moved to America for her graduate studies, earning a PhD as a Fulbright Program scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1963. Her graduate work involved the prediction of chemical shifts in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy under the supervision of Herbert S. Gutowsky. She was awarded the Eastman Award for the most outstanding chemistry graduate student. She completed postdoctoral studies with Martin Karplus at Columbia University. She mapped the NMR Chemical Shift and indirect coupling constants across the whole periodic table. She worked won the relationship between dihedral angle and spin-orbit coupling.  Research and career  In 1968 Jameson returned to University of Illinois at Chicago as an Assistant Professor. She was made full Professor in 1976. Jameson spent time as a visiting scientist at the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and Queen's University. Her work uses quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics to understand molecular electronic properties such as nuclear magnetic shielding. Jameson worked on NMR in the gas and liquid phase to establish inter and intra-molecular effects on NMR parameters. She looked at how isotopic substitution impacted the chemical shift of NMR, and used rotational‚Äìvibrational averaging theory to explain intramolecular effects, such as isotope effects and the temperature dependence of shifts in NMR. She used gas phase NMR to extract relaxation times that allowed calculation of effective collision cross-sections. She described how NMR shifts could be used as a paradigm for electronic properties of molecules. Jameson established the field of 129Xe NMR to study local environments with high sensitivity and fast data acquisition. She used 129Xe and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations to study adsorption and diffusion in zeolites. She provided the mathematical explanation for the chemical shift and spin-spin coupling observed in NMR spectroscopy of chiral materials. She contributed to the book Multinuclear NMR, which provided information about the theory and observations in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of various nuclei. She was the first woman to deliver NMR section Rocky Mountain Conference on Analytical Chemistry Vaughan Lecture in 2000. She spent a year as a Visiting Miller Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 2008 Jameson returned to the Philippines to teach a quantum chemistry course for university teachers. She is a member of the Philippine-American Academy of Science and Engineering.  Academic service and advocacy  In 2003 Jameson was part of the University of Illinois at Chicago National Science Foundation ADVANCE program WISET, which looked to support women in science and engineering. Jameson designed the Postdoc Institute at University of Illinois at Chicago. She was recognised by the University of Illinois at Chicago as Woman of the Year. She delivered the Jean Dreyfus Boissevain Lecture at Washington & Jefferson College. Jameson was a member of the Chicago chapter of the American Chemical Society, where she helped to judge the Josiah Willard Gibbs Award from 2006.

Early life  Gibson was born on 16 May 1868 in Ipswich, Queensland, the daughter of bank manager James Gibson and Anne Bush Blair (n√©e Copeland). The family moved to Manley, Brisbane when her father retired. She was taught art by prominent local artist Godfrey Rivers at the Brisbane Technical College from 1899 to 1905. Inspired to study art abroad, her family financed a three- year study trip to Paris. Gibson left Australia in September 1905 and had established herself in Montparnasse, Paris by May 1906 where she lived until 1939.  Career  Gibson was not a part of the avant-garde art scene of early twentieth century Paris. Instead, she worked within the conservative world of the Royal Academy and Salon exhibitions.  Later life  Gibson left Paris in 1939 with the outbreak of World War II and spent the war years in England engaged in Red Cross work. When peace was declared she returned to Paris. Returning to Australia in 1947, Gibson's work was almost unknown in Australia, despite recognition of the work of contemporary female expatriates. This is probably because of her shyness and her Queensland background. Her work is now in several State galleries, the National Gallery of Australia and in private collections. She died in a Brisbane convalescent home on 13 July 1961 and was cremated.

However, Richard Andrews purportedly preceded him as the first wounded in action, at the Battle of Gonzales on October 2, and was the first killed in action, at the Battle of Concepci√≥n on October 28.  Early life  Samuel McCulloch Jr. was born on October 11, 1810, in South Carolina. His white father, Samuel McCulloch Sr., had three daughters in addition to Samuel Jr. There is no mention of Samuel's mother in any official record. His father moved the family to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1815. They relocated to Jackson County, Texas, on the Lavaca River, in 1835. Five months after their arrival in the Texas territory of Mexico, the Texas Revolution broke out, and Samuel Jr. took up the cause.  Texas Revolution  Samuel McCulloch Jr. joined the Matagorda Volunteer Company, under the command of George M. Collinsworth, even though he had only lived in Texas for five months. He fought in the Battle of Goliad. McCulloch attempted to storm into the officers' barracks and in the process took a bullet to the shoulder, which made him among the first soldiers wounded in the Texas Revolution. The shot shattered his shoulder. For the next year, the wound left him disabled, and even after the wound healed, it continued to affect him for the rest of his life. By April 1836, McCulloch was able to return home, although the family was forced to flee as the advancing Mexican Army drove the Texan revolutionaries north. On July 8 of that year, McCulloch's wound would be finally tended to by a doctor, who removed the musket ball from his shoulder.  Legal trouble in the new republic  McCulloch soon found himself living in a country that had just banned all free blacks from living there. With the passing of the Texas Constitution in 1836, all people of African and Native American descent were denied citizenship. McCulloch petitioned the Congress of the Republic of Texas for an exemption to the law. In April, he was granted the exemption, along with the land grant that he was entitled to for his service in the Texas army. In August 1837, he married Mary Vess, a white woman. This marriage violated the Texas ban on interracial unions. The couple was never prosecuted, however. In 1840, McCulloch and his sisters were exempted from the Ashworth Act, and they lived in Texas until their deaths. Samuel McCulloch's Grave.

Having joined the Zurich based Julius Baer Private Bank as COO in 2006, he was the CEO from May 2009 until his widely unexpected resignation in November 2017. In June 2018, Collardi joined the Geneva-based Pictet Group as partner.  Early Years  Boris Collardi grew up in Nyon, where he obtained an accounting major from the Cessouest School in 1993. Subsequently, he joined the Career Start Program at Credit Suisse in Geneva. From 1995 until 2006 he was active in various functions at Credit Suisse. Commencing as an Analyst in the Investment Research Group in Zurich, he worked his way through the ranks, including two stints in Singapore, before taking the role of private banking CFO in 2003 and becoming private banking COO of EMENA and Head of Special Projects in 2004.  Julius Baer   Becoming CEO  In 2006, Collardi joined the Julius Baer Bank as COO following its acquisition of three private banks and GAM, a Swiss asset management company, in 2005. The publication ‚ÄúGlobal Custodian‚Äù credits him as a decisive factor behind the successful integration of these banks and the subsequent establishment of Julius Baer as ‚Äúone of the premier addresses in global wealth management‚Äù. In 2008, he topped the Wealth Bulletin top-40 list of rising stars under the age of 40 among over 300 contenders. Only one year later, following the tragic passing of Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd and Julius Baer Holdings Ltd. CEO Alex Widmer, Collardi was chosen to succeed interim CEO Johannes de Gier, in the process becoming the bank's youngest-ever chief executive.  Strategy The Wall Street Journal describes what followed as ‚Äúan aggressive, acquisitive expansion‚Äù. At the end of 2009, the bank had 150 billion Swiss francs in assets under management, 80% were booked in Switzerland. Since then, Julius Baer has more than doubled its assets under management, totaling 393 billion Swiss francs in October 2017. Acquiring Merrill Lynch‚Äôs international wealth business in 2013 marked the largest single increase in AUM. Diversifying into new markets was also part of the declared strategy ‚Äì by 2013 more than 75% of the bank‚Äôs net new money originated from emerging markets, with Asia in first place followed closely by the Middle East. In 2014, Bank Leumi‚Äôs Swiss and Luxembourg business were acquired, with Commerzbank‚Äôs Luxembourg division and a majority stake in Italian asset manager Kairos following in 2016. In 2015, Jimmy Lee was hired from Credit Suisse to spearhead Julius Baer‚Äôs Asian expansion, with the target of becoming the bank‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond home market‚Äù. Citing cost and complexity of a multi-market presence, Collardi predicted private banks would either focus exclusively on one or two markets, become part of a gigantic, integrated firm offering all facets of banking (asset management, commercial, investment and private banking), or achieve the critical mass to be able to afford an international pure-play private bank, the latter of which formed the basis of his strategy. While keen on expansion, he stressed the importance of organic growth through direct hire and client acquisitions. Asked about some of the failed attempts by competitors to enter the Asian market, Collardi remarked, ‚ÄúWe look at three things: costs, investments and three-year revenue growth. At the beginning of each year, we are prudent and adjust short-term expenses and decrease headcount where needed.‚Äù Regarding management, he stressed the importance of keeping people in their functions for many years, eliminating the need to re-explain the strategy and building long-term trust with clients. Consequently, the bank‚Äôs structure was divided into five markets with independent leadership: Switzerland, Europe, Asia, Latin America and emerging markets, in order to better cater to each‚Äôs individual idiosyncrasies. Despite his ambitions, Collardi noted the importance of risk management when evaluating takeovers, going as far as to call them potential atomic bombs. As of 2016, Julius Baer planned to invest several hundred million Swiss francs into technology and was developing a new centralized, fully digital IT platform, to be rolled out worldwide. Simultaneously, Collardi admitted that the bank had been a ‚Äúlate adopter‚Äù of technological advancements during a Financial Times interview. Going forward, however, he expressed his enthusiasm for blockchain and its potential to improve transactional products and services, such as international money transfers or stock market trading. He reaffirmed this stance two years later, saying the execution and back office aspects of the value chain will become fully automated and allow for increasingly customizable products. The value creation will shift from transaction execution, which becomes a low-cost commodity, to advisory, with additional resources allocated to direct client contact, understanding clients‚Äô needs and improving the advice provided. As of 2018, Luxembourg and Asia have migrated to the new platform. According to Collardi, the rollout will be completed by 2020. At the time of his departure, the bank‚Äôs price-to-book valuation was roughly double that of local rivals UBS and Credit Suisse.  Resignation  On November 27, 2017, Julius Baer announced the resignation of its CEO Boris Collardi, effective immediately, due to his decision to take on a new position as partner of The Pictet Group, a direct competitor. Chief Risk Officer Bernhard Hodler assumed the CEO position, with the bank announcing an evaluation process addressing the long-term leadership of the group. In September 2017, Bernhard Hodler was announced to be replaced as Chief Risk Officer by Oliver Bartholet, coming from UBS, effective April 1, 2018, with Hodler becoming deputy to the CEO. There was speculation at the time as to Hodler being the intended successor to Chairman of the Board Daniel Sauter, who would be hitting the 12-year term limit in 2019. At the annual shareholder meeting in April 2018, Chairman Sauter announced Hodler was appointed to guide the bank in the long run and not as an interim solution. While the bank was generally considered to be in good shape by the company chairman Daniel Sauter, analysts as well as media outlets, his strong leadership position in the bank and the abrupt departure were considered risk factors towards the market valuation and mid-term success of the bank. Key shareholder Harris Associates also expressed their disappointment. Shares opened down 4.2% following the news. The news, while unexpected, should not have come as a complete surprise according to sources within the industry, as Collardi was known for his drive and affinity towards challenges and had largely implemented his vision for Julius Baer since taking over the realms in 2009. He was quoted in 2014 saying, ‚ÄúWhen you have a challenging environment, you can win on strategy and execution. If you have the right idea, deploy the right resources, and see the opportunity before someone else, you can really make a difference.‚Äù  Pictet  At Pictet, Collardi has assumed the role of partner alongside Nicolas Pictet, Renaud de Planta, R√©my Best, with whom he is running the bank's global wealth management business, Marc Pictet, Bertrand Demole and Laurent Ramsey. He is the first outsider to join in almost 20 years and one of only 42 to ever hold such as position. Despite the company's smaller size, though the 492 billion Swiss francs in AUM are greater than at his former employer, Collardi stressed his desire to be more of an entrepreneur than employee as a key factor in his decision to take on the role. Due to Pictet's legal structure, Collard's new compensation plan will likely never be released to the public, but his departure from Julius Baer did result in a considerable compensation cut including not receiving a bonus for 2017 and leaving behind over 7 million francs worth of unvested stock awards. Despite Pictet‚Äôs reserved attitude regarding public commentary, the bank has conceded its need to grow in Asia. Collardi's extensive experience in Asia, a region where Pictet‚Äôs presence is comparatively small at US$36 billion AUM relative to Julius Baer's 65 billion USD, makes him a good fit for the bank. It has, however, also fueled speculation on the potential for poaching not only employees but client assets from his former employer. Collardi excluded this possibility, indicating there was enough room for both to grow, and mentioned that in any case getting to know the existing teams was required before decisions on additional hires could be made. Given Pictet's 213-year history, traditional approach and tendency to hire from within the company, his appointment also made possible culture clashes a topic, considering Collardi's extensive personal network and tendency to be directly involved with staffing decisions. Nicolas Pictet, the eighth-generation to run the bank, remarked that, on the contrary, he sees Collardi as a powerful endorsement of the continued strategy of independence, organic growth and focus on the long term in the best interests of our clients.  Impact on Switzerland‚Äôs Banking Sector  Besides guiding his former employer Julius Baer though the transition to a much larger, globally established pure-play private bank, Collardi has also engaged himself for the Swiss banking sector as a whole. He was president of the Association of Swiss Asset and Wealth Management Banks for over six years until his resignation in May 2018. During this time, he established the association as a recognised political and public voice, in alignment with his personal conviction that private banking is and should undoubtedly continue to be a key export industry in Switzerland. Collardi was also a Board Member of the Swiss Finance Institute since 2014 and was elected Vice-Chairman in September 2017. At the Swiss Banking Association's 2018 Annual General Meeting he was elected to the Board of Directors. Boris Collardi became CEO of Julius Baer during a time when the Swiss banking industry was facing significant challenges. The United States Department of Justice had begun investigating long-standing practices among Swiss banks with regards to how it treats foreign client assets. Julius Baer had voluntarily approached the DoJ regarding its past practices in 2009, something the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) had advocated against, as it was looking for a universal solution for banks and raised concerns the bank may otherwise violate Swiss banking secrecy laws. Such an agreement was reached in 2013. Julius Baer signed a deferred prosecution agreement with the DoJ in 2016, in which the bank agrees to pay 547.25 million USD in compensation, which were booked in the bank's 2015 financial results, acknowledges its practice of helping US citizens evade taxes by setting up undeclared accounts, but in exchange will not be prosecuted. This penalty was lower than what rivals UBS and Credit Suisse paid and, as opposed to the latter, did not include an admission to a criminal charge. Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline Ciraolo commented that while this agreement made it clear that there is a heavy price to be paid for misconduct, there is significant benefit in fully cooperating. In 2016, Collardi announced he anticipates further consolidation in the finance sector as a result of both the settlements reached with US authorities and increased regulatory pressure going forward resulting in increased costs. While the investigations into Swiss tax practices were a setback for the industry, Collardi maintained Swiss banking had significantly more to offer than tax avoidance or evasion. During a 2010 offshore banking conference in Zurich, he commented: ‚ÄúSwitzerland currently manages around a third of the world‚Äôs USD 7 trillion worth of offshore money. I believe around 40 percent of these assets currently under management in Switzerland are here for secrecy reasons but only around eight or 10 percent of that amount is here purely for tax avoidance and greater transparency will see this all but vanish. However, the levels of service and safeguard of assets that the Swiss banking system provides will enable it to continue its role as a safe haven for incoming funds.‚Äù and Part of his strategy for Julius Baer's expansion was to increase the percentage of mandated assets under management, meaning the bank makes decisions on behalf of the client on the basis of general criteria such as expected returns, acceptable volatility, market segments, ethical considerations and more. Mandated AUM increased from 30% in 2015 to 45% in early 2017, with the ultimate goal of reaching 100%. Another element was the implementation of new advisory levels based on tiers, the aim of which was to both increase the consistency and quality of the advice given to clients as well as stabilize the revenue streams for the bank amid stricter regulations on fees and retrocessions and an increasingly competitive market putting pressure on margins. Similar steps were taken at competitor UBS. Talking to CNBC Asia in 2013, Collardi said: ‚ÄúI personally think that given a choice even in this new business model, clients will continue to favor Switzerland over other financial centers.‚Äù  Vision for the Swiss Banking Industry  At the joint annual press conference of the Association of Swiss Private Banks (ASPB) and the Association of Swiss Asset and Wealth Management Banks (VAV) in January 2018, Boris Collardi presented his vision for Swiss private banking and wealth management, summarized below.ASPB Media Conference: Boosting private banks with a programme of reforms and differentiated regulation and  Relevance of the sector  Collardi emphasises the significance of the sector for Switzerland. Private banking generates more than half of all revenues in the local banking sector. Within that sector, two thirds of gross revenues originate from the cross border business, in which Switzerland is the global leader, at twice the size of the US or Singapore, and three times the size of Hong Kong. On the other hand, the above-average growth rates in Asia up to 2021 make it clear this could change. He sees Switzerland‚Äôs stability and security as a central unique selling point. Nevertheless, Western Europe remains Switzerland‚Äôs largest cross-border wealth management market. It accounts for 40% of business at one trillion Swiss francs from EU domiciled clients and employs around 20‚Äô000 people and results in approximately 1.5 billion Swiss francs in business tax revenue. Most importantly, it is dependent upon active and unhindered access to the European Common Market and an intact, stable political relationship, ruling out a ‚Äústand-alone‚Äù policy for Switzerland.  Key challenges facing the industry  * The high general debt level and the low interest rates which must be risk-managed. * The regulatory framework from the fallout during the financial crisis, described as ‚Äúessentially sensible‚Äù, which result in increased expenditure on compliance, investor protection, accounting standards and tax data exchange. * Client expectations towards bank services (quality, reliability, transparency) and the IT platforms required to deliver this. * Increasing competitive pressure due to the globalized nature of the business.  Elements of future success  In order for Switzerland to remain the global market leader in private banking by 2025, he presents a competitive regulatory framework, a positive image and sustainability in the industry as essential.  Competitive regulatory framework  This takes into account the export nature of the private banking and asset management business. Implementation of the OECD developed automatic exchange of information (AEOI) is, by Collardi's assessment, a fundamental paradigm shift. It requires actively approaching clients and providing a full range of services locally rather than clients seeking out a bank. With regards to the European Single Market this assumes, at a bare minimum, continued bilateral agreements and acknowledged equivalency of Swiss financial regulation. In case the aforementioned does not succeed, Collardi suggests a comprehensive financial services agreement should be sought out which fairly balances Swiss and EU interests. He emphasises the importance of refraining from the so-called ‚ÄòSwiss finish‚Äô, meaning not going beyond international standards and thereby putting the Swiss financial centre at a disadvantage. Effort should instead be put into ensuring compliance with the ‚Äòlevel playing field‚Äô principle by foreign competitors. Of particular relevance is the ‚Äòactivation clause‚Äô, recently adopted by the Swiss parliament, which was strongly advocated for by the Association of Swiss Asset and Wealth Management Banks. It means information is only handed over to a country if it adheres to the principle of reciprocity and there is an assurance it will be used properly. For context, in 2017, Yves Mirabaud, senior managing partner at the Geneva-based private bank carrying his name, commented that ‚ÄúData could be sold or used to put pressure on clients or their families,‚Äù and that he is specifically referring to countries with uncertain democratic standards or high levels of corruption. Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD‚Äôs tax policy director, acknowledged this argument, but added that if such an ‚Äòactivation clause‚Äô was used as an excuse, the offending country will be sanctioned. Nevertheless, critics remained unconvinced, such as Nicholas Shaxson of the Tax Justice Network, an organization that lobbies against tax havens, who called it a ‚Äújustification for an ocean of fraud.‚Äù Finally, he proposes the establishment of a ‚Äòlighthouse‚Äô institution for training and education in the financial sector, similar to what the world renowned Ecole h√¥teli√®re de Lausanne does for the hospitality trade.  Positive industry image  The positive image aspect focuses on highlighting the banking sector's over 200-year tradition as well as its efforts to maximize quality and professionalism. In order to achieve this, the dialogue with politicians, the administration and the population is to be stepped-up in order to achieve full acceptance as an export industry like any other.  Sustainable transformation  Sustainability in the industry involves the importance of partnerships and a continuous digital and industrial evolution. Partnerships with independent asset managers (IAM), have, by Collardi's assessment, been somewhat neglected in the past and are now rightfully receiving much deserved attention. Despite being competitors with regards to direct client contact and advisory services, they face the same challenges in dealing with regulation and training resulting in considerable interdependence. IAMs will not be able to cope with all of the incoming regulatory requirements and infrastructure demands, while larger banks will have the opportunity to diversify revenue streams by serving IAMs. Collardi sees digitization as a positive impact, resulting in fintech and automated advisory services for the increasingly autonomous but demanding customers. However, he is convinced that the provision of personal advice to clients will always be at the heart of the private banking and wealth management business. In the industrial aspect he draws comparisons to what has occurred in the automotive industry and calls for a more entrepreneurial approach. Manufacturing has largely been automated, with the majority effort being invested in research and development in order to differentiate the products. Similarly, he sees legal, compliance, standard banking documentation, procurement and mortgage processing as a priority for complete or partial automation. Further areas of interest are basic financial research solutions and solutions for know your customer (KYC) requirements such as client background checks. Due to the effort required to develop such systems, it is important for banks to closely cooperate in non-competing sectors, i.e. standardized solutions, preventing unnecessary duplications and increasing quality standards. He mentions the repositioning of SIX Group and their establishment of a ‚Äúnetwork services‚Äù innovation unit as a first step in the right direction. Its aim is to develop services for its shareholders, who are almost exclusively domestic and foreign banks.

Like the second and third symphonies, the fourth symphony is based on the texts of the 11th-century German monk and musician Hermanus Contractus. The music of the symphony consists of three blocks or phrases which are repeated through various permutations whilst retaining a recognisable shape.

It was unveiled at MWC 2019 on 25 February 2019 and was originally scheduled to launch in June 2019, but the launch was pushed back to allow for extensive testing in light of the failures reported by users of a similar product, the Galaxy Fold from Samsung. The Mate X launched in China only in November 2019.  Specifications  Hardware The Mate X has an 8-inch OLED display that can fold outwards resulting in a 6.6-inch main display and a 6.38-inch rear display. The screen is covered by plastic and is secured by a push-button latch when closed. It uses the Kirin 980 and has 8 GB of RAM with 512 GB of UFS 2.1 storage. The latter is expandable up to 256 GB via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory. The device contains two batteries split between the two halves, totaling a 4500 mAh capacity, and can quick charge at 55W. The Mate X has a bar situated on the right side of the device with four cameras and an LED flash on the back, the power button/fingerprint sensor on the left side and a USB-C port on the bottom. The cameras include a 40 MP main lens, a 16 MP wide-angle lens, an 8 MP telephoto lens and a time-of-flight sensor. The bar is roughly twice as thick as the rest of the device, giving the user a grip to hold it. Unlike the Galaxy Fold, it comes standard with 5G enabled by Huawei's own Balong 5000 modem. Software The Mate X runs on Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" with Huawei's EMUI 9.1 skin. Successor Huawei announced the Mate Xs on 24 February 2020 as a hardware revision of the original Mate X; it was released in \\"global markets\\" outside China in March 2020. The device features a more durable display, improved hinge function and a redesigned cooling system, as well as the newer Kirin 990 5G SoC and Android 10 with EMUI 10.

She was a Putch clan elder and a cultural leader of the Wik and Kugu people of Aurukun, Cape York Peninsula, Far North Queensland. Her work is held in national and state collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide and Gallery of Modern Art, Brisbane. Early life and education Ngallametta was removed from her family at the age of five and grew up in the dormitories of Aurukun Mission. She maintained connections with her family, learning to weave dilly bags and fruit bowls, made from cabbage palm and pandanus, from her mother and aunty. Career Mavis Ngallametta was initially recognised for her mastery of weaving in traditional materials. While attending a workshop at the Wik and Kugu Art Centre, run by Gina Allain, she began making small paintings depicting important cultural sites. Larger paintings refer to the changing seasons as well as specific sites including Ikalath, where she collected the white clay Yalgamungken, for the vibrant local ochres; her traditional country, the coastal side of Kendall River, which she was able to view from the air; Wutan, a camping site belonging to her adopted son Edgar; and various pamp, or swamps, around Aurukun. Ngallametta painted with traditional materials, including ochres, clays and charcoal, which she collected herself. Between 2011 and 2019, she created 46 monumental paintings. According to Sally Butler: \\"nearly every major public and private art collection in Australia\\" acquired one of these large-scale paintings between 2011 and 2014. Work  Major exhibitions  Queensland Art Gallery Gallery of Modern Art is hosting the first major retrospective of Ngallametta's work in 21 March - 2 August 2020.

Native to mountain ranges of western North America including the Olympic Mountains and Cascade Range of Washington and the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia and Alberta south to Colorado, it occurs on rocky outcrops and talus at subalpine and alpine elevations, i.e., from , and blooms from late May until early September. Description This perennial rhizomatous herb typically forms a grayish-green mat with more or less hairy stems reaching a maximum height of 1.5 centimeters to around 20 centimeters. The ovate or obovate basal leaves are long by wide, entire or pinnately lobed. They are borne on petioles about as long as the leaf. Leaves on the flower stem are similar but smaller and borne alternately on short petioles. A solitary flower-head is borne on a slender upright or ascending stem. Flowers have four white, or sometimes light-purple, petals long and six stamens with yellow anthers. Evolutionary history The evolutionary history of the Smelowskia genus was examined in a study published in 2010 in the journal Taxon. Based on microsatellite and DNA sequences, the Smelowskia genus first appeared in Central Asia. From there it dispersed in two separate events to North America by means of the Beringian land bridge. Smelowskia americana, S. porsildii and S. media are the result of one of these dispersals. S. porsildii is found in Beringia and S. media in the western arctic of North America. S. americana is the most widely dispersed of the three species, i.e., on mid-latitude mountains of western North America. These three regions were free of glacial ice during the Last Glacial Maximum approximately 25,000‚Äì21,000 years ago. Consequently, these species may be the result of allopatric speciation in ice age refugia.
