The college was established in 1868 for Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, a descendant of William Withers. Thomas and his wife,Mary Susannah Symonds Ravenshaw, were residents of India and were successful in the Indian Political Service. History After the great famine of 1866, the people of Odisha and few liberal Britons wanted to start a college at Cuttack. Thomas Edward Ravenshaw, Officiating Commissioner of Odisha Division finally made the Government of Bengal realise the difficulties of Oriya students in getting College education and succeeded in obtaining permission to start collegiate classes in the Cuttack Zilla School. Thus the first College in Odisha was born in January 1868 with only intermediate classes and having six students on roll. In January 1875 Commissioner Ravenshaw proposed to convert the Ravenshaw Collegiate School into a full-fledged degree College. The Government of Bengal accepted the demand with the condition that a public contribution of Rs. 30,000/- be deposited for the proposed College. Ravenshaw took up the matter as an object of personal interest and guaranteed the collection of the required amount. Mr. H. Woodrew, DPI of Bengal supported Ravenshaw. Mr. H. J. Reynolds, Secretary to the Government of Bengal requested the Government of India to sanction the incidental charges and the post of the Principal on the additional condition of meeting half the monthly expenses by public donation. Due to Mr. Ravenshaw's efforts and the support of the Maharaja of Mayurbhanj, HH Shree Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo by means of financial help, the College department of the Collegiate School was finally converted in 1876 to a full- fledged Government Degree College, bearing the name 'Cuttack College' affiliated to the University of Calcutta. Mr. Samuel Ager was appointed as the first Principal. The college then had only 19 students on roll. Maharaja of Mayurbhanj H.H. Sri Krushna Chandra Bhanjdeo donated Rs. 20,000/- as a permanent endowment for the college which almost fulfilled the condition imposed by the Government for public contribution. On his insistence the name of the college was changed to Ravenshaw College in 1878 after Thomas Edward Ravenshaw to commemorate his services to the cause of education in Odisha. The College was granted permanent status by 1881. Growth of the college in the initial days was slow. Altogether 94 graduates were produced by the closing year of the 19th century and the student strength had increased to 97. Science stream remained confined only to Intermediate level until 1912 when Bihar and Odisha were separated from Bengal. The college entered a new phase of development after 1912. School and survey classes were removed. Teachers of Indian Education Service were appointed as professors in different departments. New subjects such as Political Economy, Political Philosophy and honours in History and Persian were introduced. Infrastructure facilities for teaching of science at BSc level were augmented. The student strength rose to 280 in 1912 and 375 in 1915. A new site (the present site) for the college at \\"Chakkar Padia\\" was located by the Government to construct a complete set of new buildings at an approximate cost of Rs./-. In 1916 the University Bill proposed the transfer of Ravenshaw College from Calcutta University to Patna University to be created newly. Although there was some public resistance for the change of affiliation, the then commissioner rightly supported the transfer by writing \\" Divorced from the Calcutta University, its progress would be rapid and in course of time it should be able to supply every educational need of the people of Odisha\\". Accordingly, the affiliation of the college was transferred to newly created Patna University on 1 October 1917. The college was shifted to its present site in the erstwhile \\"Chakkar Padia\\" in 1921. While laying the foundation stone of the present building in the November 1919 Sir Edward Gait, the then Governor of Bihar and Odisha wished that this mighty monument would one day grow into a University. Maharaja of Mayurbhanj donated Rs. 1,00,000/- for the electrification of the new building and purchase of equipment for science laboratories. A library building having an area of . was opened in 1922 by Lt. Governor of Bihar and Odisha. Maharaja of Kanika Sri Rajendra Narayan Bhanjadeo generously donated Rs. 55,000/- for its construction which stands today as a beautiful piece of architecture. In his honour the library is named as \\"Kanika Library\\" which is very close to the hearts of educated Oriyas. In recognition of the public generosity, the Government sanctioned Rs. 25,000/- towards purchase of books for the newly created \\"Kanika Library\\". After the shifting of the main library to the centenary building, the old premise houses the journal section. Legislators from Odisha such as Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das and Sri Krishna Mohapatra demanded time and again for further growth of the college in Bihar Odisha Legislative Council and Viceroy's Council. In the words of Krishna Mohapatra \\"Odisha had a pet child and that child was the Ravenshaw College.\\" In response to public pressure Mathematics honours got recognition by 1920. A year later affiliation was granted to BSc. in Botany and the College became a postgraduate institution with M.A. classes in English started in 1922 through munificence of Maharani Smt. Parvati Devi, the queen of Sonepur, in granting Rs. 1,71,500/- for its opening. The staff position of Ravenshaw College was strengthened with the appointment in 1918, of scholars such as Sir Jaudunath Sarkar and R. P. Khosla as professor of History and Economics respectively. By 1922 the sanctioned strength of teaching staff had reached 31, out of which 13 came from Indian Education Service, two were Europeans and the rest were from provincial Education Service. Honours classes in Physics, Chemistry and Botany were opened with effect from July 1930 and steps were initiated to start postgraduate teaching in all subjects which was fulfilled after Odisha became a separate province. Co-education began in 1929‚Äì30 with 4 girl students taking admission in the college. Their number gradually rose over the years. Medical facilities opened in the college with the appointment of a Sub-assistant surgeon and medical examination became compulsory for all students from October 1929. The College remained affiliated to Patna University even after the separation of Odisha from Bihar in 1936. The affiliation was finally transferred to newly created Utkal University in 1943. In fact during these times Urdu as a separate department for the first time in a college in Odisha was inaugurated at Ravenshaw College & headed by renowned Urdu scholar Mr Syed Manzar Hasan. In fact, it was Ravenshaw College that gave birth to the new University, nursed and sustained it. If walls could speak, the present zoology department building could say how the university started functioning on its premises more than half a century ago. The law department of Ravenshaw College was finally separated and gave birth to the Madhusudan Law College. A Brief Time line of Illustrious History of Ravenshaw 1903 ‚Äì Modern Oriya consciousness began in the formation of the Utkal Sammilani by Odisha's first graduate, first post-graduate, and first practicing lawyer, Madhusudan Das. When that Utkal Sammilani had its first session here on the Idga Ground in Cuttack, history tells us, it was attended by 335 delegates from the outlying areas; zamindars, representatives of the Gadjats, the Commissioner himself, two Christian missionaries, local intellectuals like Radhanath Roy, Madhusudan Rao, Bishwanath Kar and the Principal and students of Ravenshaw College assembled to engage in the deliberations. 1920 ‚Äì Students of Ravenshaw, like Harekrushna Mahatab, N.K. Chaudhury and their fellow alumni, opposed the idea of the same Madhusudan Das accepting ministership of the British created government and distributed leaflets in protest; they disturbed a progovernment felicitation meeting. Their activities were reported to Mr. Lambart, Principal of Ravenshaw College, and their parents were asked to withdraw the two from college just a week before their BA examinations. In the years that succeeded, parallel to the uprising of Oriya consciousness, was the beginning of the national freedom movement. When India made her shift from self-rule to demand for full freedom, the chants for freedom first reverberated within the four walls of this great Institution before they spread far and wide. 1930 ‚Äì When the Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee gave a call observing 26 January as \\"Independence day\\", history tells us that the hostelers of Ravenshaw College took the lead in organizing the celebrations and many students gave up a meal to contribute to the funds of Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das towards the national freedom movement. Then came the Salt Satyagraha and the post graduate students of Ravenshaw College actually dropped their examination in support of the struggle when a batch of protesters marched from Khurda to the sea to defy the Salt Act of the British Empire. 1937 ‚Äì Even as Odisha acquired statehood under the British Empire on 1 April 1936, there was no legislative assembly for people's representatives to represent their will and legislate on their behalf. It is no small coincidence that the grounds of Ravenshaw College were chosen for the very first meeting of the Legislative Assembly of Odisha on 28 July 1937. The new Legislative Assembly of Odisha started functioning from the Examination Hall of Ravenshaw College and upper balcony and verandah acted as balcony for visitors. 1942 ‚Äì At the forefront of the Quit India movement were the students of Ravenshaw College. On 15 August that year, 200 of them protested. They actually set the office room on fire. Among the arsonists were Banamali Patnaik, Ashok Das, Biren Mitra, Suraj Mal Saha and Bibhudendra Mishra. The last two were detained under the Defence of India Act and sent away to the Berhampur Jail. The movement spread to all other educational institutions in the state. Born of famine, child of a foreigner's vision, Ravenshaw College was the vortex of political, intellectual and literary movements in Odisha for the first seven decades of its existence. That is probably why it has produced countless heads of state, poets, politicians, judges and bureaucrats who spread their impact far and wide. Description Ravenshaw College is an alma mater of different colleges. Its Assembly hall was the venue of the Legislative Assembly of the newly carved state of Odisha. It witnessed the debates of the legislators framing laws to govern the state. It remained so until the capital was shifted to Bhubaneswar. All the significant cultural, intellectual and political movements of the state have sprung from its portals. It has nourished such great and kindred souls as Utkal Gourab Madhusudan Das, Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihar Das, Pandit Nilakanth Das, Pandit Godabarish Mishra, Bidhu Bhusan Das, Prabhat Nalini Das, Bhubaneswar Behera and Bhubanananda Das. It had on its staff such great scholars as Artaballav Mohanty, Sir Jadunath Sarkar, Sir Ross Masood, Prana Krushna Parija, Balabhadra Prasad, Acharya Jogeschandra Vidyanidhi, Mahendra Kumar Rout, Baba Kartar Singh, Parasuram Mishra, P.A.Sundaram and A.K.Dasgupata, to name a few. Most of the prominent political leaders of the state such as Biswanath Das, H.K.Mahatab, Nityananda Kanungo, S.N.Dwibedi, Biju Patnaik, Nilamani Routray, Nandini Satpathy, Janaki Ballav Patnaik and Rabi Ray were Ravenshavians. The college produced creative writers such as Kalindi Charan Panigrahi, Ananda Shankar Ray, Gopinath Mohanty, Sachidananda Routray, Ramakanta Rath, Sitakant Mahapatra and Surendranath Mohanty. In short, the college has been the major source of preparing manpower to lead every sphere of the society. In the Diamond Jubilee celebration address the then Principal Mr. H.R.Batheja rightly observed: \\"We have at last a temple of learning, fair to look on, stately in proportions which compares not unfavorably with the only other temple ‚Äì The temple of Jaganath for which Odisha is known all over India. The twin monuments represent Odisha to the outside world and are a source of justice and pride to every Oriya.\\" The Indian Science Congress Association meet of 1962 was held in the Ravenshaw College Quadrangle. The college achieved the unique distinction of being one of the three colleges of the country to have been awarded national honour by Government of India through the issue of commemorative stamp in 1978. The college has seen 55 Principals. It has been accorded autonomous status since 1989. It stands today on a sprawling campus of . The magnificent red brick building of gothic architecture has several blocks added to it in course of time. The main library is located in the new centenary library building. Teaching is now imparted to more than 5000 students in Arts, Science and Commerce faculties. Altogether there are 22 departments out of which 17 have postgraduate teaching facility and M.Phil course is available in 12 subjects. In addition, several new courses have been added under autonomous functioning besides the regular courses. There are 11 hostels, 9 of which are on the campus, accommodating about 2,500 boarders. The College also houses, besides Ravenshaw Junior College having student strength of 1536, the Cuttack Study Centre of Indira Gandhi National Open University having student strength of 1133, IAS Coaching Class and Pre-Examination Training Centre for SC/ST students. The campus also has a post office, an extension counter of the State Bank of India, a Dispensary, a power house, GED, PWD and PHS sections, a canteen, Guest House, a gymnasium, and spacious playgrounds. Ravenshaw University has acquired a distinctive, secular, cosmopolitan culture of its own helping all Ravenshavians to live the college motto \\"Gyanameba Shakti\\" or \\"Knowledge is Strength\\". Emblem The emblem is designed in three segments, separated by a river and its tributaries. The Microscope on left symbolizes the insatiable human spirit of enquiry and scientific research fostered by this institution. The palm leaf manuscripts on a stand with writing instrument on the right represent the great storehouse of accumulated wisdom of past generations and the pursuit of creativity which are the hallmarks of this institution. The open book at the bottom epitomizes dissemination of knowledge and wisdom which the college inculcates in its countless scholars. The river and its tributaries suggest the endless flow of knowledge through great stretches of time and the perennial flow of life, its unity and diversity.

It is found in an area roughly corresponding to present-day Alachua County, the northern half of Marion County and the western part of Putnam County. It was preceded by the Cades Pond culture, which inhabited approximately the same area. Origin The archeologist Jerald Milanich suggests that the people of the Alachua culture were immigrants from what is now Georgia. Early Alachua culture pottery resembled that of the Ocmulgee culture found along the Ocmulgee River. In this scenario, the Ocmulgee immigrants were either already practicing agriculture or adopted it shortly after arriving, and settled in upland areas suitable for agriculture. These areas had been little used by the Cades Pond people, who had occupied areas in wetlands. The Cades Pond culture disappeared soon after the appearance of the Alachua culture.Milanich 1994: 333-36 Other archaeologists have suggested that the distinctive Alachua pottery types developed in situ, and even that the resemblance between Ocmulgee and Alachua pottery resulted from a migration from the Alachua area to the Ocmulgee area.Roland: 138-39 Archaeologists also note the close resemblance between Alachua culture and neighboring Suwannee Valley culture pottery, which appears to have developed in situ out of the McKeithen Weeden Island culture.Worth: 153-54, 164-65 Periods The precolumbian part of the Alachua culture period has been divided into the Hickory Pond period (600 to 1250) and the Alachua period (1250-1539).Milanich 1994: 338 At the time of first contact with Spanish explorers, the Alachua culture area was occupied by the historical Potano Indians, a branch of the Timucua. They spoke the Potano dialect of the Timucua language.Milanich 1995: 90 The sub-periods in the Alachua culture period are defined by the relative prevalence of different pottery types. The most common type of pottery during the Hickory Pond period was the Prairie Cord Marked style. The Alachua Cob Marked style became more prevalent in the Alachua sub-period. Other styles of pottery occurred throughout the Alachua culture period.Milanich 1994: 337-38 The period after 1539 was characterized by the introduction of European artifacts and of pottery styles from other cultures. The Potano II period was marked by the almost complete replacement of traditional pottery styles by Leon-Jefferson pottery styles (associated with the Apalachee). This suggests that the depopulated Potano Province was repopulated from Apalachee Province, but no evidence of such a population movement has been found in Spanish documents.Milanich 1995: 214-15 Stone and bone tools show little variation over the course of the period.Milanich 1994: 340 Sites The Alachua-culture people occupied hardwood hammocks, with village sites on high ground, near streams or sinkholes.Milanich 1994: 334-35 The village sites are often in clusters, which may have resulted from periodic relocation of a village in a small area. The village clusters tend to fall along lines, which may represent the lines of the hammocks, or the paths of trails. Archaeological sites associated with the Alachua culture include the Richardson (8AL100)Site, currently believed to have been the site of the town of Potano visited by Hernando de Soto in 1539, as well as the later mission of San Buenaventura de Potano. Other Alachua culture sites include Bolen Bluff, Fox Pond, Henderson Mound, Law School Mound, Rocky Point and Woodward Mound and Village.Milanich 1994:333-336 Subsistence The presence of Cob Marked pottery throughout the period indicates that the people of the Alachua culture grew maize. Middens contain few fresh water shells, and a smaller number of animal species, compared to Cades Pond middens. This may indicate a reduction in hunting and gathering as food sources, compared to the preceding Cades Pond culture.Milanich 1994: 335 A more detailed analysis of the food resources used by the Alachua culture people has not been made. Burial mounds are found in the area, but have not been extensively excavated. Storage pits and indications of other structures, including a circular house at one site, have been found in villages.

It is located along U.S. Route 60 in the central part of Arizona, about 35 miles northwest of central Phoenix, and while technically located within the city's metropolitan area it is generally regarded by locals to be just outside it. As of the 2010 census, there were 6700 people living in the Wittmann ZIP Code Tabulation Area (85361), but 763 in Wittmann itself. A variant name was Nadaburg; the present name is for Joseph Wittmann and his wife Eleanor van Beuren Wittmann, a couple who attempted several times to get approvals to build a dam project in nearby Box Canyon that would benefitted the town. This was to be a successor to the poorly engineered Walnut Grove dam that collapsed in February 1890 less than two years after it had filled. Eleanor van Beuren's father was the nominal head of a group of East Coast investors that had funded what was then primarily a placer mining project. One of the Walnut Grove Water Storage Company's engineers (not responsible for the design) was Lieut. Col. Alexander Ogden Brodie who was later appointed Arizona's Territorial governor. Governmental approval and adequate funding lacking, the replacement dam project plans faltered. A long projected time for repayment of supplemental Government funding killed Joseph Wittmann's project in the 1940s leaving promises to Maricopa County families broken. The naming of nearby Morristown also refers to the Wittmann and van Beuren families, for they had residences in Morristown, New Jersey. History The town was first named Nadaburg, which is a combination of two words, the Spanish word \\"Nada\\", which means \\"nothing\\" and the German word \\"burg\\", which means \\"town\\". The railroad who built the Southern Transcontinental Railroad line named the site Nadaburg years before the area was formally opened to homesteading as a result of the Department of Interior Act of December 29, 1916.History of Nadaburg\\"A brief history of a tiny western town\\" by: Rock Betu William Hovey Griffin, a native of Texas, founded the town of Nadaburg (Wittmann). He filed his homestead petition in September 1920. That same year he also plotted out the town site. Griffin donated a block of land to the Maricopa County School District where the little Red School House (it was white at that time) was built. The school currently serves as the Nadaburg Unified School District Governing Board‚Äôs Boardroom. Joseph Wittmann, continuing a legacy initiated by his father-in-law, endeavored to build a dam on the Hassayampa River, which would bring irrigation water to the town of Nadaburg. In 1926, lots and acreage were given to Wittmann, by the citizens of Nadaburg, in support of the construction of the dam. In 1930, the people of Nadaburg changed the name of the town to Wittmann, honoring the family who promised them the water that would irrigate their fields. Other land and claims included those that had belonged to the Wittmann-van Beuren family ever since the Walnut Grove Water Storage Company went into receivership in the 1890s. However, unable and/or ill-equipped to keep his family's promise, Joseph Wittmann and his son Joseph, Jr. were sued by the citizens of the town. Justifiably, at least half of them were able to recover their lands.  Demographics  As of the census of 2010, there were 6700 people living in the Wittmann area (Zip Code 85361), but 763 in Wittman itself. The population density was 56.3 people per square mile. The racial makeup of Wittmann was 83.8% White, 0.8% Black or African American, 1.2% Native American, 0.5% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 10.6% from other races, and 3.0% from two or more races. 24.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

The original 505 area code, covering the whole state. North American area code 505 is a New Mexico telephone area code which was one of the original area codes established in October 1947. Until October 7, 2007, it covered the entire state of New Mexico. It currently serves the northwestern and central portions of the state, including the Albuquerque metropolitan area, Gallup, Santa Fe & Farmington. Due to the increasing demand for new numbers, area code 505 was split on October 7, 2007. Northwestern and central New Mexico continued to be served by the 505 area code, while the remainder of the state switched to area code 575. The issue was decided in 2006 by vote of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, with a 3-2 majority in favor of allowing the Albuquerque area to keep the old area code. The question of how to implement a new area code was a contentious one. The need for a new code had been clear since at least 2000, but the PRC's initial votes for Albuquerque and Santa Fe to switch to a new area code and the rest of the state to keep the old 505 area code (including the Farmington and Gallup areas that are now part of the current 505 area code) were met with vocal opposition and even death threats. Amid heightening tensions between the urban and rural areas of the state, the commission eventually chose to put off the decision until 2006 after number pooling made the immediate addition of a new code unnecessary. \\"The 505\\" (a reference to the area code for New Mexico) is a slang term indicating the state of New Mexico.

The daily launched video news in its online edition in the second part of the 2000s, being among the first in the region. As of 2008 Abdul Hamid Ahmad was the editor-in-chief of the paper. Regular op-ed contributors to Gulf News include: Uri Avnery, Kuldip Nayar, Faisal Alkasim, Joseph A. Kechichian, Sami Moubayed, Marwan Al Kabalan, Rakesh Mani, Linda S. Heard, Stuart Reigeluth and Wael Al Sayegh. Gulf News moved to its present headquarters on Sheikh Zayed Road in April 2000. Gulf News changed its format to Berliner on 1 June 2012, being the first Berliner-format daily published in the Arab countries. In 2016, Gulf News appointed Jonathan Richards as Digital Strategy Director, who led digital transformation at the newspaper and the team that created a new design for the newspaper, a new CMS and classifieds platform getthat.com. Sponsorship and promotion Gulf News was the first newspaper in the region to promote the arts, culture, music and sport through sponsorship of events. In March 1989, The paper started the Gulf Business Awards in collaboration with DHL for the Best Chief Executive, Enterprise and Businessman. The scheme was discontinued in 1996. The Gulf News Fun Drive was started in March 1986. The 26th Fun Drive was held in December 2006 and saw 750 all-terrain vehicles with over 2,800 participants. An earlier Fun Drive was recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as being a significant first achievement.

Gulf News also sponsors an evening of horse racing at Nad Al Sheba, with each race being named after one of its titles. The paper also sponsors a number of other sporting events in the UAE, as well as seminars and conferences. Principal among this latter is the Arab Strategy Forum, where leaders in politics and industry gather to discuss current events affecting the region. Role in Orkut ban On 3 July 2007, Gulf News revisited the issue of Orkut's \\"immoral activities\\" communities, publishing complaints from members of the public against Orkut communities like \\"Dubai Sex\\", and officially bringing the complaints to the attention of the state telecom monopoly Etisalat.Orkut.com 'being used for immoral activities' Gulf News 3 July 2007 The ensuing moral panic resulted in a renewed ban of the site by Etisalat by 4 July 2007.Orkut.com banned in the UAE Gulf News 4 July 2007 Awards The newspaper won the Asia - Pacific award for best newspaper production in July 1990. The online edition of the paper was reported by Forbes Middle East in 2010 to be the number one among the English-language online newspapers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as well as in the UAE. The paper's online version was the seventh most visited website among all online websites in the same ranking. Forbes Middle East named it as the third online newspaper overall in the Arab world in the period from 31 August 2011 to 31 August 2012. Controversy In January 2009 Gulf News ran a column by Mohammad Abdullah Al Mutawa that claimed the holocaust was a lie. \\"Today, the whole world stands as a witness to the fact that the Nazi holocaust was a mere lie, which was devised by the Zionists to blackmail humanity. The same Zionist entity swindled the world out of billions of dollars over the years to compensate the wrong and unjust which they claim to have been inflicted on their people. It is evident that the holocaust was a conspiracy hatched by the Zionists and Nazis, and many innocent people gave their lives as a result of this inhuman plot.\\" The article has since been removed from Gulf News' website. On 15 December 2013, Gulf News in its editorial claimed without mentioning any source that Pakistan and Afghanistan did not vote for Dubai in its bid for Expo 2020. The Foreign Office of Pakistan quickly brushed aside the allegations as baseless mentioning the facts that Pakistan was committed to bid for Turkey Izmir since Turkey approached Pakistan for its support in 2011 long before Dubai even expressed its interest to host Expo 2020. Javed Jalil Khattak, Consulate General of Pakistan in Dubai, in an open letter to Gulf News termed the editorial as \\"an orchestrated attempt to damage and defame the historic fraternal relations between Pakistan and the UAE\\", while the editorial drew an angry reaction from the Pakistani expat community in the UAE. On July 10th 2017, Francis Matthew, former Editor and then Editor-at- Large at Gulf News, was charged with the murder of his wife, Jane, allegedly with a hammer blow to her head, over a row about finances. According to the charge, he killed her in the early morning of 4th July 2017, then went to work and held meetings as normal, after which he then returned in the evening to their villa and reported to police that thieves had broken in and assaulted her. After questioning he admitted he killed her, claiming she harangued him when a huge argument erupted over finances and debts totalling some 1 million dirhams (¬£200,000). Subsequently, controversy surrounding his sentencing and re-sentencing has led to media reports. In October 2018 his sentence was increased from 10 years to 15 years, with pleas from Jane Matthew's family to change the charge from physical assault to premeditated murder. But then, due to the death of Jane's father, his lawyers were allowed to appeal again, as UAE newspaper The National reported: \\"Jane's only surviving legal heir, her son, had previously signed a waiver dropping criminal charges against his father. This meant all private charges against him had been dropped but that public law ‚Äì the right of government law against an accused ‚Äì was still applicable. In UAE law, if the legal successors of a victim drop charges and waive their private rights, the court is still obliged to impose a penalty against the accused under public law ‚Äì but it will be a shorter term.\\". While the minimum sentence for murder in the UAE is 10 years, Matthew's defence expects a reduction to two years based on public law. The case is ongoing.

The tournament is a grassroots developer with the main objective of discovering and developing Malaysian motorcycle racing talents. The title sponsor of the championship is Petronas and it is supported by motorcycle manufacturers Modenas, Yamaha, Honda, and Suzuki. History The name Cub Prix itself is derived from the moniker Cub ‰ªî. Pronounced ‚Äòcub chai‚Äô or ‚Äòkapcai‚Äô, the phrase literally means Little Cub in Cantonese and refers to the original Honda Cub (Honda 50 that was introduced by Soichiro Honda in 1958). Today, the name has become synonymous with underbone motorcycles in Malaysia. Begun in 1994, the concept was to create a motorsports championship that was accessible to people from all walks of life. That is why, to this day, Cub Prix races predominantly on the streets with a maximum of two rounds per year held at permanent circuits. To date, Cub Prix is still the only mobile motorsports event that brings the excitement of motorcycle racing to its fans throughout the country. Through Cub Prix‚Äôs mobility, the championship has visited every major town and city in Malaysia. A typical season for Cub Prix consists of 10 rounds beginning in late March and ending in December with a two-month break in between for the Ramadan and Shawwal celebrations. Cub Prix 2011 Penang Stage Underbone The underbone motorcycle was born in Asia in 1958 when Soichiro Honda rolled out the first Honda 50. An underbone motorcycle is a small motorcycle built around a single tube frame called the underbone. This ‚Äòunderbone‚Äô supports the whole vehicle and runs low all across the length of the motorcycle. There is a similarity in appearance to the scooter, largely due to the fuel tank position, the open-frame design which the fuel tank position allows and the splash guards. However, the entire power train, namely the engine position, power transmission and wheels are based on the design of conventional motorcycles. The position of the fuel tank, in fact, located below the seat, is the main aspect that truly differentiates the underbone with other conventional motorcycles. This allows for a design that improves ease of mounting and dismounting, making the underbone popular with consumers of both genders. The engine size of a typical underbone motorcycle can range between 80cc to 150cc. In the early years, two-stroke engines were the norm, but come the turn of the millennium, the four-stroke evolution picked up speed. The technical sophistication of larger motorcycles such as fuel injection systems, capacitor discharge ignition and electric starters, were gradually fused into the underbone. With each addition, the underbone became zippier, sportier and trendier. Objectives Since its inception, Cub Prix‚Äôs main objective is, and always has been, to build a strong base of grassroots talents from which promising and talented Malaysian riders can be filtered through to the higher levels of racing. Grassroots development forms a very important part in the growth of any sport. Without a strong foundation, even the most glittering pinnacle at the top of the pyramid would crumble and fall Race Categories The actual format of the race classes and their technical regulations differ from season to season, evolving either in response to, or to trigger changes in the industries. In 2017, the race categories are as follows: Open-Make Categories Cub Prix during Season 2012 * CP150 ‚Äì A new class opened for Malaysian Cub Prix 24 for the year 2017, with introduction of new cub bikes with larger engine capacity for the year 2016. Due to this had increased demand for this class to be opened, requested by public, manufacturers to enhance more marketing and interest as cub class motorcycles continues to grow in the country. It replaces the former CP130 by increasing the engine capacity of category and due to this implementation, most team are able to utilize fuel injection systems in their bikes to qualify for Euro inspection races as required by FIM. For this class, it will be the first time fuel injection systems being used in Cub Prix history. Formerly known as the Expert class, this is the premiere class of the Malaysian Cub Prix. * CP125 ‚Äì Intermediary category for riders who have had some racing experience but are not yet ready to race in the hyper-competitive CP150 class. * Wira ‚Äì This is an age-restricted class only for riders aged between 13 years to 17 years old.  Semi-Amateur Category  * Privateer ‚Äì This is strictly for privateer riders who race without corporate sponsors. One-Make Categories The one-make categories of the Malaysian Cub Prix play a vital role in the effort to bring in more fresh talent every season. Fully supported by motorcycle manufacturers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha, the manufacturers prepare the bikes for the riders who are also supplied with the proper racing gear and safety attire. The one-make races, therefore, become ideal platforms for first-time newbies to break into the sport. To qualify for the one-make races, the riders must range from ages 13 to 20 and must be first-time riders in Cub Prix. In 2017, the one-make categories are: * Yamaha PETRONAS Super Series * Honda Dash 125 Challenge * Aeon Credit Service Yamaha NVX Challenge The Malaysian Cub Prix is only open to Malaysian riders only and all entries must hold the appropriate racing license issued by the Motorsports Association of Malaysia (MAM). Key Milestones *1994: First Cub Prix race on May 8, 1994, in Melaka. *2002: Introduction of the age-restricted Wira class specifically for riders below-21 years of age. This is Cub Prix‚Äôs first 4-stroke class. Since then, the age ceiling has been progressively dropped as part of the Championship‚Äôs drive to attract more younger riders who will be able to enjoy a longer international career. *2003: Petronas signed on as title sponsor of the Malaysian Cub Prix. *2005: The introduction of the Team Award in the Expert class, aimed at creating recognition for the teams‚Äô efforts to develop new talents, added heat to the competition. *2006: The Novice class was transformed from 2-stroke 110cc to 4-stroke 115cc. The age- ceiling in the Wira class was lowered to under-19. The landmark year also saw the old making way for the new. Veteran names like M. Meganathan, Wazi Abdul Hamid, Shahrun Nizam Tamin, Chia Tuck Cheong and Soong Chee Kieong announced their retirements. A new batch of riders quickly came in to fill the void. *2007: The Malaysian Cub Prix went from a one-day event to a two-day event, giving more track time to the riders. *2008: The migration from 2-stroke to 4-stroke was finally complete when the 4-stroke 125cc class was introduced for the Expert category. *2009: Race classes were rebranded. The Expert category was renamed the CP130 class and the Novice category was renamed as the CP115 class. Nasha Edziera Bahauddin, the first woman rider, starts competing in Cub Prix. *2017: CP150 class replaces the CP130. *2020: CP125 class replaces CP115 Creating Malaysian Champions In 2009, the key teams and sponsors of the Malaysian Cub Prix came together as an industry to launch its first mega- project. A wildcard development programme aimed at training Malaysian riders to race in the World Motorcycle Grand Prix. After an exhaustive training and selection process, Elly Idzlianizar Ilias and Zulfahmi Khairuddin made their GP125 debut. From there, Zulfahmi was given the opportunity to race full- season in the GP125 class of the MotoGP and became the 2nd Malaysian to do so after Shahrol Yuzy. In 2010, the wildcard project moved from the GP125 class to the newly introduced Moto2 class. Only one rider was selected ‚Äì Md Zamri Baba. In 2011, the wildcard project was expanded to two riders ‚Äì Md Zamri Baba and Hafizh Syahrin Abdullah.  Future  The organiser considering to add a new 'Rookie' category into the championship because of overwhelming response received during the new season rider's registration. Organiser received near 1000 rider's applications for the Season 2017 championship. On December 2017, Benelli, one of the oldest Italian motorcycle manufacturers, testing their prototype for CP150 class category. Currently, there are only two constructors competes in CP150 class which is Honda and Yamaha. With Modenas expected to launch their new supermoped in 2018, it is very likely Modenas will compete in the CP150 class in the future.

He obtained a patent for his method in July 1738, and his system remained in production for over 100 years. Under the Bristol Brass Company, from 1738 within works established at the Old Market, by September 1742 he had produced of zinc per charge from six crucibles located in the furnace, at a cost of around ¬£7,000. However, he had now created two sets of enemies: * The local residents, who in September 1742 reported Champion to the City Council. They sought assurance that Champion would cease metal smelting at the site immediately. * The zinc importers and traders. When he started his experimentations, spelter sold at ¬£260 per ton. By 1750, this had reduced to ¬£48, resulting in a loss to the traders who were trying to force Champion out of business. Warmley Works In 1742 father Nehemiah ‚Äì a widower ‚Äì married a widow, Martha Vandewall, the sister of Thomas Goldney III. The Goldney family owned land in Warmley, and in 1746 backed by the Goldney family, William left the Bristol Brass Company and began to construct the Warmley Works. With tools and manufacturing equipment supplied by the Darby Ironworks at Coalbrookdale, over the next few years Warmley Works became the biggest metal processing plant in the world, with outputs of zinc, copper, brass and other metals. After the death of his father in 1747, William was joined in the business by his brother Nehemiah, and sister Rachael as a shareholder. In February 1750, William applied to the House of Commons for some form of recompense for the losses he had suffered in making the first home produced zinc, which he hoped would allow extension of his patented process. Although a committee reported agreed that the patent should be extended through an Act of Parliament, a counter petition by the powerful lobby of the merchants of Bristol delayed the passage, and William later abandoned the legal process. However, William continued to expand the business through development at both the Warmley site, as well as new furnaces at Kingswood, a forge at Kelston near the River Avon, and a battery mill at Bitton on the River Boyd. By 1754, he had: > '15 copper furnaces 12 brass furnaces; 4 spelter or zinc furnace; a battery > mill or small mill for kettles; rolling mills for making plates; rolling and > cutting mills for wire; and a wire mill of both thick and fine drawn kinds. His brother John Champion developed a refined process and patented in 1758 the calcination of zinc sulfide (zinc blende) to oxide for use in the retort process. The English zinc industry was concentrated in and around Bristol and Swansea. Docks and Bristol floating harbour By 1765, with excess capital on his hands, William commenced development of a new dock at Rownham on the eastern bank of the River Avon, which would be capable of holding 36 large ships. However, after the increased cost of construction depleted his resources, and with a distinct lack of trade, he sold the dock in 1770 to the Merchant Venturers for ¬£1770, who renamed it The Merchants' Dock. During the dock's construction, William had also proposed creating a complete floating harbour at Bristol, by building lock gates on the River Avon where it junctioned with the River Frome. However, the plan was abandoned due to an estimated cost of ¬£37,000. Downfall By 1767, the Warmley Company claimed to have a capital of ¬£200,000 and to give employment to about 2,000 people. Further, William had taken out additional patents covering: the refining of copper by using wrought iron pipes to remove arsenic from the smelt; using pit coal instead of charcoal to make brass wire; using zinc sulphide instead of calamine to make his brass. The company had been formed under the \\"Bubble Act\\", and in 1767 petitioned Parliament to change its status to incorporation. In return, the partners offered to invest another ¬£200,00 worth of capital, including ¬£30,000 into the production of brass pins. This brought about the combined wrath of other metal companies formed under the Bubble Act, as well as the pin makers of Gloucester, who petitioned that such an investment was 50% greater than their existing facilities. In April 1767 the Commons issued a warrant that gave authority for the preparation of Charter of Incorporation, but this was countered by the competitors. After lengthy legal proceeding, a second warrant was issued by the Attorney General in October 1767. This led to a further counter-petition, which claimed that the Warmley Company would become a monopoly. By March 1768, the opposition had won and no further steps were taken to obtain a Charter of Incorporation. Due to the collapse of the process to incorporate, in April 1768 William's partners discovered that he had tried to withdraw part of his capital without permission, and he was instantly dismissed from the company. Because he could not pay his debts William Champion was declared bankrupt. He died in 1789. Legacy Now a debt-encased and loss-making enterprise, on 11 March 1769 the Warmley Works were offered for sale in Felix Farley's Bristol Journal. Sold to the Harford & Bristol Copper Company, they also obtained the rights to Champion's patents. Using the process but winding down the operations until 1809, they later sold the Bitton Battery Mill in 1825 for use as a paper mill. Because of the American War of Independence, the price of tar greatly increased, which was used at the time as a sealant on ships. On 29 April 1780 an advert appeared in Sarah Farley's Journal offering for sale a process of making English tar, from the estate of the deceased William Champion. Later, a tar works was established within Bristol Harbour. See also *National Smelting Company References  *P. K.

Background In 1961, Jennings and his band began playing a club called J.D.'s in Scottsdale, Arizona, owned by J.D. Musil. Jennings' eclectic repertoire, which included country, rock and roll, and folk music, made him a local star as he gained a loyal fan base throughout Arizona. \\"It's a thing called payin' your dues,\\" the singer explained in the authorised video biography Renegade Outlaw Legend, \\"but while you're payin' your dues you're learnin' your craft, you're learnin' your trade.

An active investor may buy a property, make repairs and/or improvements to the property, and sell it later for a profit. A passive investor might hire a real estate firm to find and manage an investment property for them. Typically, investors choose real estate for several reasons: cash flow, capital appreciation, depreciation, tax benefits and leverage. Appreciation occurs over time, generally, though an investor may \\"force the equity\\" in a property by making enhancements to it or the surrounding environment to increase its value. In general, residential real estate is valued by the \\"comparable sales\\" method which estimates the value of property under the principle of substitution. The method estimates property values by comparing a subject property to similar properties sold in similar locations within a recent period of time. Depreciation is one of the many benefits afforded to real estate investors. Though the property is actually increasing in value, the government allows owners to systematically depreciate the property over its projected useful life span. Depreciation is an allowable tax deduction. In addition to depreciation, an investor will usually claim the interest portion of his monthly mortgage payment as a tax deduction. Leverage is a powerful reason for investing in real estate. If an investor used 100% cash to acquire a house worth $100,000, and the house increased in value by $5,000 in one year, then the investor made a return of 5% (assuming no other costs in this case). However, if the investor obtained 95% financing, only $5,000 cash would be required at the closing table, and a bank or other lender would loan the remaining $95,000 to acquire the property. Assuming the same $5,000 increase in value, the investor's cash contribution of $5,000 would yield an increase in equity of $5,000 in one year, a 100% return. Leverage works in the opposite manner as well. A $1,000 decrease in value would produce a negative 20% return on the $5,000 investment. Real estate investing has become quite popular in recent years due to rising property values and low interest rates. However, Deflation in property values or a sharp increase in interest rates would dampen the market considerably.

Life  Godfrey was the son of Godfrey, Count Palatine of Lotharingia, and Ermentrude. He was a sixth generation descendant of Charlemagne and was related, through blood and marriages, to the most important royal families in Europe. His great aunt was Oda, married to Gerhard I, Count of Metz, and the widow of the Carolingian king of Lotharingia Zwentibold, also sister of Henry the Fowler, the Saxon king of Germany. His aunt, Oda, was married to Gozlin, Count of Bidgau and Methingau, and he was thus a cousin of Godfrey I, Count of Verdun, whose children later became dukes of Lower Lorraine as well. In 958, Bruno finished off the revolt of Count Reginar III and exiled him. He gave his county to Godfrey. The next year, Lorraine was divided, to make it easier to defend from enemies within and without. The lower portion went to Godfrey while the upper to one Frederick. In 962, he was made count of J√ºlich. He accompanied the Emperor Otto I, his first cousin once removed, into Italy, against the usurper Adalbert, in 962 and died at Rome of an epidemic in 964.

Prior to his appointment, Cordray variously served as Ohio's Attorney General, Solicitor General, and Treasurer. He was the Democratic nominee for Governor of Ohio in 2018. Cordray was raised near Columbus, Ohio and attended Michigan State University. He was subsequently a Marshall Scholar at Brasenose College, Oxford and then attended the University of Chicago Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Law Review. He clerked for Judge Robert Bork on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and for Justice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1987 he became an undefeated five-time Jeopardy! champion. Cordray was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1990. After redistricting, Cordray decided to run for the United States House of Representatives in 1992 but was defeated. The following year he was appointed by the Ohio Attorney General as the first Solicitor General of Ohio. His experience as Solicitor led to his appearance before the United States Supreme Court to argue six cases. Following Republican victories in Ohio statewide elections in 1994, Cordray left his appointed position and entered the private practice of law. While in private practice he unsuccessfully ran for Ohio Attorney General in 1998 and the United States Senate in 2000. He was elected Franklin County treasurer in 2002 and reelected in 2004 before being elected Ohio State Treasurer in 2006. Cordray was elected Ohio Attorney General in November 2008 to fill the remainder of the term ending in January 2011. In 2010, Cordray lost his bid for reelection to former U.S. Senator Mike DeWine. He became Director of the CFPB via recess appointment in July 2011 and was confirmed by the Senate in 2013. Cordray left the agency in late 2017 to run for governor of Ohio, an election he lost to DeWine. Early life, education, and early law career Cordray was born in Columbus, Ohio, the middle child between brothers Frank, Jr. and Jim, and was raised in Grove City, Ohio, where he attended public schools. At Grove City High School, Cordray became a champion on the high school quiz show In The Know and worked for minimum wage at McDonald's. He graduated from high school in 1977 as co-valedictorian of his class. His first job in politics was as an intern for United States Senator John Glenn as a junior at Michigan State University's James Madison College. Cordray earned Phi Beta Kappa honors and graduated summa cum laude with a BA in Legal & Political Theory in 1981. As a Marshall Scholar, he earned an MA with first class honours in Economics from Brasenose College, Oxford and earned a Varsity Blue in basketball in 1983. At the University of Chicago Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor with honors in 1986, he served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review. After starting work as a law clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court, he came back to his high school to deliver the commencement speech for the graduating class of 1988. Cordray began his career clerking for Judge Robert Bork and Supreme Court associate justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. After clerking for White in 1987-1988, he was hired by the international law firm Jones Day to work in its Cleveland office. Early political career (1990‚Äì1995) From 1989 to at least 2000, Cordray taught various courses at The Ohio State University Moritz College of Law and at Georgetown University. Ohio House of Representatives In 1990 Cordray ran for an Ohio State House of Representatives seat, in the 33rd District (southern and western Franklin County), against six-term incumbent Republican Don Gilmore. Unopposed for the Democratic nomination, he defeated Gilmore by an 18,573-11,944 (61-39%) margin. 1992 congressional election In 1991 the state Apportionment Board, controlled by a 3-2 Republican majority despite the party's 61-38 minority in the state House of Representatives, redrew state legislative districts following the results of the 1990 Census, in the hope of retaking control of the state House. The new boundaries created nine districts each with two resident incumbent Democrats, pairing Cordray with the 22-year incumbent Mike Stinziano. Unable to be elected in another district due to a one-year residency requirement, Cordray opted not to run for reelection. Cordray ran for Ohio's 15th congressional district in the 1992 U.S. House of Representatives elections, and won the Democratic nomination over Bill Buckel by an 18,731-5,329 (78-22%) margin, following the withdrawal of another candidate, Dave Sommer. Cordray's platform included federal spending cuts, term limits for Congress and a line-item veto for the president. When Deborah Pryce, then a Franklin County municipal judge, announced that she would vote to support abortion rights, Linda S. Reidelbach entered the race as an independent. Thus the general election was a three-way affair, with Pryce taking a plurality of 110,390 votes (44.1%), Cordray 94,907 (37.9%) and Reidelbach 44,906 (17.9%). Ohio Solicitor General While in private practice in 1993, Cordray co-wrote a legal brief for the Anti-Defamation League, in a campaign supported by Ohio's attorney general, for the reinstatement of Ohio's hate crime laws. This was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, but not ruled on because of its similarity to a previous Wisconsin ruling. In 1993 the government of Ohio created the office of state solicitor general to handle the state's appellate work. The state solicitor, appointed by the Ohio attorney general, is responsible for cases that are to be argued before the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court. Until 1998, the Solicitor worked without any support staff. Cordray, who had earlier worked for a summer in the office of the United States solicitor general, was the first Solicitor to be appointed, in September 1993. He held the position until he resigned after Ohio Attorney General Lee Fisher was defeated by Betty Montgomery in 1994. His cases before the Supreme Court included Wilson v. Layne () and Hanlon v. Berger (). Though he lost his first case, he won his second case, which garnered a substantial amount of media attention for its consideration of the constitutionality of media ride-alongs with police. Other cases included Household Credit Services v. Pfennig (), Brown v. Legal Foundation of Washington (), Demore v. Kim (), and Groh v. Ramirez (). Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's right to erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the symbolic meaning of the cross was different from the Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3 m) cross the following day. The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year the Klan again applied to erect a cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice Department. Cordray was granted a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of execution for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court. Latter political career (1995‚Äì2007) In early 1996 Cordray was elected to the Ohio Democratic Party Central Committee from the 15th district by a 5,472-1,718 margin over John J. Kulewicz. From 1995 to 2007 Cordray was a sole practitioner and Of Counsel to Kirkland & Ellis. Alt URL In late 1996 Cordray, who was in private practice at the time, was a leading contender and finalist for a United States Attorney position during the second term of the Clinton Administration, along with Kent Markus and Sharon Zealey. Zealey was eventually selected. 1998 Ohio Attorney General election During the 1998 election for Ohio attorney general, Cordray ran unopposed in the Democratic primary but was defeated, 62%-38%, by one-term Republican incumbent Betty Montgomery. 2000 U.S. Senate election Cordray entered the U.S. Senate elections in a race that began as a three-way contest for the Democratic nomination to oppose first- term Republican incumbent Mike DeWine. The three-way race was unusual since the three candidates (Cordray, Rev. Marvin McMickle, and Ted Celeste) were encouraged to campaign together in order to promote name recognition, conserve resources and lessen infighting. Ohio Democratic party leaders believed Cordray was better suited for an Ohio Supreme Court seat and urged him to drop out of the Senate race. Despite the Ohio Democrats not endorsing any candidate in the primary election, the entry of Dan Radakovich as a fourth competitor, and the anticipated entry of former Mayor of Cincinnati and television personality Jerry Springer, Cordray persisted in his campaign. Celeste, the younger brother of former Ohio governor Dick Celeste, won with 369,772 votes. He was trailed by McMickle (the only black Senate candidate in the country in 2000) with 204,811 votes, Cordray with 200,157, and Radakovich with 69,002. Franklin County Treasurer Cordray as Ohio Attorney General Cordray was unopposed in the May 7, 2002, primary election for the Democratic nomination as Franklin County treasurer. He defeated Republican incumbent Wade Steen, who had been appointed in May 2001 to replace Bobbie M. Hall. The election was close, unofficially 131,199‚Äì128,677 (50.5%‚Äì49.5%), official margin of victory 3,232. Cordray was the first Democrat to hold the position since 1977, and he assumed office on December 9, 2002, instead of after January 1 because he was filling Hall's unexpired term. The Franklin County Republican party made no endorsement in the 2004 election, but Republican Jim Timko challenged Cordray. Cordray defeated him and was elected to a four-year term by a 272,593‚Äì153,625 (64%-36%) margin. As Franklin County treasurer Cordray focused on four major initiatives: collection of delinquent tax revenue through a tax lien certificate sale, creation of a land bank, personal finance education, and the development of a community outreach program. He managed a portfolio that averaged $650 million and consistently beat its benchmarks, and set new records for delinquent tax collection in Franklin County, which was the only Ohio county with a AAA credit rating. He also served as president of the Board of Revision and chair of the Budget Commission. In 2005, Cordray was named the national County Leader of the Year by American City & County magazine. Statewide office (2007‚Äì2011) Ohio Treasurer In the 2006 Democratic party primary election for Ohio Treasurer, Cordray was set to face Montgomery County Treasurer Hugh Quill, but Quill withdrew before the election. He defeated Republican nominee Sandra O'Brien for state treasurer in the 2006 election. Cordray succeeded Jennette Bradley in a near-statewide sweep by the Democratic Party. Cordray noted that when he assumed statewide office, Ohio was challenged with restoring public trust after the misdeeds of former Ohio Governor Bob Taft. Referring to what would be required to follow Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann and his interim successor Nancy Rogers, he said: \\"... we have been patiently rebuilding the public trust there [in the state government] and I think it would be a very similar task there in the Attorney General's office.\\" Ohio Attorney General 2008 election Cordray campaigning for Barack Obama on October 13, 2008 in Columbus, Ohio Cordray announced his 2008 candidacy for Ohio state attorney general on June 11, 2008. He was endorsed by Ohio Governor Ted Strickland. The vacancy in the office of the attorney general was created by the May 14, 2008, resignation of Marc Dann, who was embroiled in a sex scandal. Several leading Republican party contenders such as Montgomery, Jim Petro, DeWine, Maureen O'Connor, and Rob Portman declined to enter the race. Cordray's opponents in the race were Michael Crites (Republican), and Robert M. Owens (Independent). Cordray had a large financial advantage over his opponents, with approximately 30 times as much campaign financing as Crites. Crites's campaign strategies included attempts to link Cordray with Dann‚Äîan association The Columbus Dispatch called into question‚Äîand promoting himself as having more years of prosecutorial experience. Cordray asserted that he managed the state's money safely despite the turbulence of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Ohio statewide offices are regularly contested every four years in the midterm election years. 2008 was a Class 2 senatorial election year, and Ohio is a state with class 1 and class 3 senators. Thus the Attorney General race was the only non-presidential race in the 2008 election aside from contests for two seats on the Ohio Supreme Court. Cordray defeated Crites, 57%-38%. Tenure Bank of America In July 2009 Denny Chin, a judge on the United States district court for the Southern District of New York, granted lead plaintiff status to a group of five public pension funds for investor class-action lawsuits against the Bank of America Corporation over its acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Company. The claim was that Bank of America misled investors about Merrill's financial well-being prior to the January 1, 2009 acquisition despite awareness that Merrill was headed toward a significant loss that amounted to $15.84 billion in its fourth quarter. The suit also alleged that significant bonus payments were concealed. The curious dealings led to congressional hearings about why the merger commenced without any disclosures. In September 2009 Cordray, on behalf of Ohio's largest public employee pension funds (State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System), the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and pension funds from Sweden and the Netherlands, filed suit alleging that Bank of America, its directors and four executives (Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Joe Price, accounting chief Neil Cotty and former Merrill chairman and CEO John Thain) acted to conceal Merrill's growing losses from shareholders voted to approve the deal the prior December. Cordray's first official portrait at CFPB Prior to the filing the five funds had filed individual complaints, but the September filing of an amended complaint joined the actions with Cordray representing the lead plaintiff. The amended complaint included details about conversations and communications between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives that were revealed in media reports, congressional testimony and investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing was an attempt to recover losses endured when Bank of America's share price fell after the transaction. The damages were sought from Bank of America, individual executives, the bank's board of directors, including any insurers that cover directors' legal liabilities. Among the specifics of the claim were that Bank of America agreed to allow Merrill Lynch to pay as much as $5.8 billion in undisclosed year-end discretionary bonuses to executives and employees and that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch executives were aware of billions of dollars in losses suffered by Merrill Lynch in the two months before the merger vote but failed to disclose them. Bid rigging case In April 2010 Cordray reached a $1 billion settlement with American International Group (AIG), one of four remaining named defendants (along with Marsh & McLennan, Hartford Financial Services and Chubb Corp.), in a 2007 antitrust case regarding business practices between 2001 and 2004. The settlement was divided among 26 Ohio universities, cities and schools. Zurich Financial Services settled in 2006. Cordray believes that Marsh was the organizing company for the illegal practices and noted that a trial could commence in 2011. AIG admitted no wrongdoing and said the settlement was to avoid risks and prolonged expenses. 2010 election On November 2, 2010, Cordray lost his reelection bid to former U.S. senator Mike DeWine by two points. Cordray was repeatedly mentioned as a potential 2014 candidate for governor of Ohio, but after being confirmed to a five-year term to head the CFPB, he declined to run. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (2012‚Äì2017) President Barack Obama announces the nomination of Cordray as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on July 18, 2011 On December 15, 2010, Special Advisor to President Barack Obama Elizabeth Warren announced that she had selected Cordray to lead the enforcement arm of the newly created United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), saying, \\"Richard Cordray has the vision and experience to help us build a team that ensures every lender in the marketplace is playing by the rules.\\" In announcing his appointment to this position Cordray also said that he intended to once again run for statewide office in Ohio in 2014. Cordray described the opportunity to The Wall Street Journal as a chance to resume \\"... in many ways doing on a 50-state basis the things I cared most about as a state attorney general, with a more robust and a more comprehensive authority.\\" On July 17, 2011, Cordray was selected over Warren as the head of the entire CFPB, but his nomination was immediately in jeopardy because 44 Senate Republicans had previously vowed to derail any nominee in order to push for a decentralized structure to the organization. This was part of a pattern of conflict between Republicans in the Senate and the Obama administration that had led to record numbers of blocked and failed nominations. On July 21, 2011, Senator Richard Shelby wrote an op-ed article for The Wall Street Journal affirming continued opposition (that went back to a May 5 letter to the President) to a centralized structure, noting that both the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had executive boards and that the CFPB should be no different. Politico interpreted Shelby's statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was \\"Dead on Arrival\\". In October, as the nomination remained on hold, the National Association of Attorneys General endorsed Cordray. On December 8, 2011, the Senate failed to secure cloture on Cordray's nomination. The final vote was 53-45, with 50 out of 51 Democrats voting for cloture, and 45 out of 47 Republicans voting against.Both independent Senators voted for cloture; John Kerry (Democrat of Massachusetts) did not vote; Scott Brown (Republican, Mass.) voted aye; and Olympia Snowe (R, Maine) voted \\"present\\". Senate roll call no. 223, 112th Congress, 1st session On January 4, 2012, a White House communications director announced in a tweet that President Obama would be giving Cordray a recess appointment to the post, bypassing the Senate. The move was criticized by Republican senators, who argued that Congress had not officially been in recess, and that Obama did not have the authority to bypass Congressional approval. Writing for The New Republic, Timothy Noah, a supporter of Cordray, wrote, \\"As someone who strongly supported a recess appointment for Richard Cordray to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I'm confused as to why President Obama chose to act today. ... The trouble is that the Senate isn't in recess.\\" Cordray's Recess Appointment Sure Doesn't Look Constitutional To Me, The New Republic, January 4, 2012. The United States Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision on June 26, 2014, that vacated Cordray's appointment and several other recess appointments, in NLRB v. Noel Canning, determining that the Senate was not in recess at the time of the appointments. On January 24, 2013, Obama renominated Cordray as Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Nominations of: Richard Cordray and Mary Jo White: Hearing before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, One Hundred Thirteenth Congress, First Session, on Nominations of Richard Cordray, of Ohio, to be Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection; Mary Jo White, of New York, to be a Member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, March 12, 2013 Amid a push by Senate Democrats in July 2013 to eliminate the filibuster for all executive-branch nominees, senators struck a deal to pave the way for a final, up-or-down vote on Cordray's nomination. The Senate voted 71‚Äì29 on July 16, 2013, to invoke cloture on Cordray's nomination, and confirmed Cordray in a 66‚Äì34 vote the same day. Republican groups including American Rising Squared and Congressman Jeb Hensarling filed complaints that Cordray had violated the Hatch Act by considering a run for governor of Ohio while serving as the Director of the CFPB. The United States Office of Special Counsel cleared Cordray of any wrongdoing. Cordray has said that after President Trump was inaugurated, Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney worked to undermine Cordray and the CFPB. On November 15, 2017, Cordray announced his resignation as director of the CFPB, sparking a legal dispute over who would succeed him as acting director.  2018 Ohio gubernatorial election  On December 5, 2017, Cordray announced his candidacy for Governor of Ohio in the 2018 election. He won the Democratic primary on May 8, 2018, and faced Republican challenger and Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine in the general election. On August 1, 2018, former President Barack Obama endorsed Cordray for governor. In the November 6, 2018, general election DeWine defeated Cordray with 50.7% of the vote to Cordray's 46.4%; third-party candidates received 2.9%. Personal life On July 11, 1992, Cordray married Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Cordray, a law professor at Capital University Law School. The Cordrays have twins, a daughter and son, and reside near Grove City, Ohio. His father retired as an Orient Developmental Center program director for intellectually disabled residents after 43 years of service. His mother, Ruth Cordray, from Dayton, Ohio, died in 1980. She was a social worker, teacher and founder of Ohio's first foster grandparent program for individuals with developmental disabilities. Richard Cordray carried the Olympic Flame through Findlay, Ohio, as part of the nationwide torch relay to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia and has served as a member of the Advisory Board for the Friends of the Homeless and part of Al Gore's select group known as Leadership '98. Appearances on Jeopardy! Cordray is an undefeated five-time champion and Tournament of Champions semifinalist on Jeopardy! In 1987 he won $45,303 from the show, which he used to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first- round win in the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super Jeopardy! elimination tournament of champions, as ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity Jeopardy!). But he did compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, and finishing second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, he turned down the $5,000 he won for that appearance.

The website includes thousands of photographs, hundreds of sound clips, and a virtual museum. Overview The ADW acts as an online encyclopedia, with each individual species account displaying basic information specific to that species. The website used a local, relational database written by staff and contributors. Each species account includes geographic range, habitat, physical description, development, ecosystem roles, reproduction, life span, communication and perception, behavior, food habits, predation, and conservation status. The organization of the site reinforces past biology knowledge by providing sharp images and showing common phyla on the home page.Spelman, Lucy H. Animal Encyclopedia: 2,500 Animals with Photos, Maps, and More! National Geographic, 2012. The Animal Diversity Web has resources other than its database. The website also offers a virtual museum and a cell phone app for quick reference. The virtual museum contains mostly mammals and has a large collection of skulls that can be virtually handled.Tarng, Wermhuar, et al. ‚ÄúThe Development of a Virtual Marine Museum for Educational Applications.‚Äù Journal of Educational Technology Systems, vol. 37, no. 1, 2008, pp. 39‚Äì59., doi:10.2190/et.37.1.d. The Animal Diversity Web is a non- profit site and is written largely for college students.The Animal Diversity Web Myers, P., R. Espinosa, C. S. Parr, T. Jones, G. S. Hammond, and T. A. Dewey. 2017. Although the ADW primarily targets audiences of higher education, it also provides resources for K-12 instructors.Animal Diversity Web, www.learnnc.org/lp/external/1798?style=print.  Background  The ADW was created by Philip Myers, a former biology professor at the University of Michigan, in 1995. The site now contains over 2,150 accounts of animal species along with over 11,500 images and 725 sounds. These numbers will continue to grow as the developers of the website plan to add 250 species by the end of 2017. Along with species accounts, the ADW has over 250 accounts of higher taxonomic groups. Most of the contributors to the website are undergraduate students. ADW has collaborated with 30 colleges and universities across the United States. The undergraduate students often submit reports on species as part of their course requirements.Parr, C.S. et al., (2006). Building a biodiversity content management system for science, education, and outreach. Data Science Journal. 4, pp.1‚Äì11. DOI: http://doi.org/10.2481/dsj.4.1 Each account is researched using peer reviewed scientific journals and research papers and is edited by both the professors and the staff at the ADW. This provides opportunities for students to experience real-world examples of writing skills and biology intertwining and also adds efficient contributions to the site. Experts at the University of Michigan and elsewhere also provide content at higher taxonomic levels. , The Animal Diversity Web had 3,675 contributors.  Animal Diversity Web resources  The ADW markets itself as a resource for constructing scholarly documents. All species accounts have been reviewed and approved several times over, providing the most accurate data. ADW is highly ranked by Google and Google Scholar search engines and is often the first result when searching for animal names or animal databases. Scholarly journals often draw from the ADW database when they are looking at a broad range of species in their study. When Keinath et al. collected data to determine animals' sensitivity to fragmentation, the ADW and other databases allowed them to compile evidence suggesting there are important differences among taxa in how they respond to habitat loss, depending upon habitat specialization and life history.Keinath, Douglas A., et al. ‚ÄúA Global Analysis of Traits Predicting Species Sensitivity to Habitat Fragmentation.‚Äù Global Ecology and Biogeography, vol. 26, no. 1, 2016, pp. 115‚Äì127., doi:10.1111/geb.12509. Some scholarly writers will reference the Animal Diversity Web source regardless of the size of the study. One journal about adaptive evolution in pheasants references the habitat elevation of three different types of pheasant species directly from the ADW webpage.Gu, Peng, et al. ‚ÄúEvidence of Adaptive Evolution of Alpine Pheasants to High-Altitude Environment from Mitogenomic Perspective.‚Äù Mitochondrial DNA, vol. 27, no. 1, Apr. 2015, pp. 455‚Äì462., doi:10.3109/19401736.2014.900667. The ADW is also a potential resource in the field. Biologists can use the sounds, image gallery, or descriptions to properly distinguish between closely related species.Salman, Manar Dawood, et al. ‚ÄúSorting of Glossiphonia Complanata (Linnaeus, 1758) ( Rhynchobdellida : Glossiphoniidae ) from Three Aquatic Plants in Tigris River within Baghdad City.‚Äù Egyptian Journal of Petroleum, vol. 26, no. 3, 2017, pp. 851‚Äì853., doi:10.1016/j.ejpe.2016.11.001. Experts believe ADW can be implemented as a teaching and learning tool in order to improve research and writing skills in college biology courses. ADW encourages inquiry-driven learning methods by showing methods of science in action. Student authorship of a species focuses on student research and writing in an engaging way. Students run into problems such as limited information or difficult language the helps them sharpen their skills. Publishing a species account gives students opportunities to highlight a real-world project that provides them insight about their desired field.

Most people would refer to this type of keg as a \\"half- keg\\" or \\"half-barrel.\\" The keg must be completely emptied before it should be tossed to avoid injuries. There are many different types of keg-tossing, as it is practiced throughout the world. In Ireland, the keg is typically thrown over upwards and the height of the toss determines the winner. The newest way to toss a keg combines techniques of both the discus and hammer throw. This updated form of keg-tossing does not require the athlete to toss the keg high, rather they are required to try to throw it the farthest distance. Athletes are given three attempts to throw the keg and the winner is determined by measuring the distance tossed. The one who throws the keg the furthest wins. The basic technique for tossing the keg involves swinging the keg in a pendulum like manner and releasing the keg when it is at its apex. A more experienced athlete uses a spin method similar to a hammer throw. The keg is again released when it is at its apex, allowing for the maximum distance. Strongman competitions In competitive strongman competitions, such as at the World's Strongest Man competition, competitors throw kegs of increasing weights, and the keg is generally thrown overhead and to the rear of the thrower, and must be thrown over the top of a high bar. The competitors are scored based on how many kegs they can throw over the bar in the least amount of time. In this category, the world record is held by the USA strongman Brian Shaw in an official strongman event, of 24 feet and 9 inches.

The various species inhabited northern Russia during the Upper Tatarian (Vyatskian), a Russian regional stage equivalent to the Wuchiapingian stage of the Late Permian period, dating from approximately 265 to 252.3 million years ago. It is known from several skulls and two almost- complete skeletons. Description An I. alexandri attacking a Scutosaurus The species in Inostrancevia were the largest gorgonopsids known; known individuals have total body lengths reaching up to and long, narrow skulls up to long. This animal had an average mass of 300 kg (661.3 lbs). Like several other gorgonopsids, Inostrancevia was characterized by strongly developed canine teeth, with those of the upper jaw up to long, the root corresponding to half its length. Their bodies were slender, with rather short legs. Inostrancevia shared its habitat with Scutosaurus which it likely preyed upon. Etymology Inostrancevia was named by the Russian paleontologist Vladimir P. Amalitsky in honour of the Russian geologist Aleksandr Inostrantsev. Discovery Holotype skeleton of Inostrancevia alexandri The first fossils were found in the Sokolki Assemblage Zone of the Kutuluk and Salarevo Formations in the Oblast of Arkhangelsk as part of the Northern Dvina River excavations led by Amalitsky during the end of the 19th century. Two nearly complete skeletons were found alongside several other skeletal remains, one of which was mounted and exhibited in Saint Petersburg in 1900 with the other following a few years later. Proper descriptions of the findings were published posthumously in 1922.

The peak rises steeply out of the Playas Valley, to the west, and the Hachita Valley, to the east of the range. The summit stands about 4,000 feet above the valley floors. Also, the north and west faces of the peak are particularly steep, making for an impressive mountain. There are a few other minor summits in this small range, but most are not named, except for New Well Peak with a summit elevation of and which anchors the southeast end of the mountains. Geologically this range is part of the Basin and Range Province which spans much of the southwestern U.S. and parts of northern Mexico. It is a fault-block range made up of Paleozoic limestone and Cretaceous shale and sandstones.Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, Ecologically, the Big Hatchet Mountains lie near the Chihuahuan Desert and the Sonoran Desert, but their large relief provides many ecological niches more in keeping with the mountains to the north. Notable inhabitants include bats, raptors, bighorn sheep, and javelina. The Big Hatchet Mountains are far from population centers, and have no paved road access or developed recreation sites; they therefore see little recreational activity.

It was founded by Brigham Young on 6 August 1877, 23 days before his death. He deeded several acres of land to a board of trustees for the development of a college. This was just two years after he founded Brigham Young Academy in Provo in 1875, which became Brigham Young University in 1903. History Brigham Young established the college to provide higher education to the youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in northern Utah, southern Idaho, and western Wyoming. It was intended to operate similarly to Oberlin College‚Äîthe students' work would support the college and their needs‚Äîbut the plan was never fully worked out. Classes started on 9 September 1878; they met in Lindquist Hall and also for a time in the basement of the Cache Tabernacle. Brigham Young College had nearly 40,000 students in the period of its operation. Initially it was for preparing teachers (1877‚Äì1894), then offered college courses and for fifteen years (1894‚Äì1909) granted bachelor's degrees. After 1909, it operated as a high school and junior college. Closure In 1926, the Board of Education of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church Educational System decided to discontinue all its schools except for Brigham Young University. Brigham Young College's buildings were sold to the city of Logan and were used by Logan High School. In August 1962 an earthquake occurred nearby; in 1968 the historical buildings were then demolished and replaced with new construction.

It is also a primase, making short stretches of RNA that initiates DNA synthesis. It forms a complex with T7 DNA polymerase. Its homologs are found in mitochrondria (as Twinkle) and chloroplasts. Crystal structure The crystal structure was solved to 3.0 √Ö resolution in 2000, as shown in the figure in the reference. In (A), notice that the separate subunits appear to be anchored through interactions between an alpha helix and an adjacent subunit. In (B), there are six sets of three loops. The red loop, known as loop II, contains three lysine residues and is thought to be involved in binding the ssDNA that is fed through the center of the enzyme. Mechanism of sequential dTTP hydrolysis Crampton et al. have proposed a mechanism for the ssDNA-dependent hydrolysis of dTTP by T7 DNA helicase as shown in the figure below. In their model, protein loops located on each hexameric subunit, each of which contain three lysine residues, sequentially interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of ssDNA. This interaction presumably causes a conformational change in the actively bound subunit, providing for the efficient release of dTDP from its dTTP binding site. In the process of dTDP release, the ssDNA is transferred to the neighboring subunit, which undergoes a similar process. Previous studies have already suggested that ssDNA is able to bind to two hexameric subunits simultaneously.

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co- writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in X-Men #12 (July 1965) as an adversary of the eponymous superhero team. Since then, he has come into conflict with other heroes, primarily Spider-Man and the Hulk. Cain Marko is a regular human who was empowered by a gem belonging to the deity Cyttorak, becoming a literal human juggernaut. He possesses superhuman strength and durability, and is virtually immune to most physical attacks; his helmet also protects him from mental attacks. Although not a mutant, Juggernaut has been featured as a prominent member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. He is also the stepbrother of Professor X. Since his debut during the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has appeared in over five decades of Marvel publications, featuring prominently in the X-Men titles and starring in two one-shot solo publications. The character has also been associated with Marvel merchandise including clothing, toys, trading cards, animated television series, video games. Vinnie Jones played Juggernaut in the 2006 film, X-Men: The Last Stand, while Ryan Reynolds did motion capture and voice acting for the CGI character in the 2018 film, Deadpool 2. In some reinterpretations (most notably the X-Men film series), Marko is a mutant who was born with this powers, while in others they simply come from his costume. In 2008, Juggernaut was ranked 188th on Wizard's list of Top 200 Comic Book Characters.\\"The Top 200 Comic Book Greatest Characters of All Time, Part 2\\" , May 13, 2008 (dead link).

Juggernaut\\" (article dated 2009 on first page) IGN also ranked him as Spider-Man's 22nd greatest enemy. Publication history The character debuted as an antagonist of the eponymous mutant superhero team in X-Men #12‚Äì13 (July & September 1965). In the first of these issues, he rampaged unseen throughout the X-Men's headquarters while the team's leader, Professor X, related the character's origin in a series of flashbacks. After an initial defeat in the following issue, the Juggernaut returned in X-Men #32‚Äì33 (May‚ÄìJune 1967), and returned again in X-Men #46 (July 1968), then fought the sorcerer Doctor Strange in Doctor Strange #182 (September 1969), X-Men member the Beast in Amazing Adventures #16 (January 1973), and the Hulk in The Incredible Hulk #172 (February 1974). After the canceled X-Men returned in the mid-1970s, the Juggernaut returned to fight a new iteration of the team in X-Men #101‚Äì103 (October 1975‚ÄìFebruary 1976). Storylines in Spider-Woman #37‚Äì38 (April & June 1981) and The Amazing Spider- Man #229‚Äì230 (June‚ÄìJuly 1982) explored the Juggernaut's relationship with his ally Black Tom Cassidy. The X-Men and Spider-Man proved to be regular foes for the character, who appeared in Uncanny X-Men #183 (July 1984), Marvel Team-up #150 (February 1985), and Uncanny X-Men #194 (June 1985). The Juggernaut guest-starred in Secret Wars II #7 (January 1986), battled a new generation of mutants in X-Men #217‚Äì218 (April & June 1987), appeared in a flashback story in Marvel Saga #21 (August 1987), and in a humorous episode in Excalibur #3 (December 1988). The Juggernaut also participated in the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" storyline in Thor #411‚Äì412 (December 1989) and returned in Thor #429 (February 1991). Other appearances included an encounter with his creator, Cyttorak, in X-Men Unlimited #12 (September 1996) and starring in the one-shot issue Juggernaut #1 (April 1997). In 1994 Marvel purchased Malibu Comics and began a series of crossovers that saw Marvel characters entering the Malibu Ultraverse. In 1995‚Äì1996, Juggernaut lead a group of Ultras, who were named The All New Exiles. The All New Exiles eventually met up with the X-Men in a special Malibu/Marvel collaboration, The All New Exiles vs X-Men, Issue #0, dated October 1995. The character appeared in Juggernaut: The Eighth Day #1 (November 1999) and Avengers Vol. 3, Nos. 23‚Äì25 (December 1999‚ÄìFebruary 2000) with similarly powered avatars and attempted a reformation in Uncanny X-Men # 410‚Äì413 (September‚ÄìDecember 2002) and X-Men #162‚Äì164 (November 2004‚ÄìJanuary 2005). The Juggernaut confronted his stepbrother, Charles Xavier--leader of the X-Men--in X-Men: Legacy #219 (February 2009), and fought the Hulk in Hulk #602 (November 2009). He appeared as a regular character in Thunderbolts beginning with issue #144, and remained on the team until issue #158, during the Fear Itself limited series. Fictional character biography 1960s Cain Marko is the son of Kurt Marko, who becomes Charles Xavier's stepfather when he marries Sharon Xavier after the death of her husband Brian, for which Kurt is partially responsible. Kurt Marko favors Charles and abuses his own son, Cain. Cain resents Charles and bullies him frequently. Cain Marko and his step-brother Charles serve in the US Army and are stationed in Korea. Marko finds a hidden temple dedicated to the entity Cyttorak. On entering, Marko finds and holds a huge ruby and reads the inscription on the stone aloud: \\"Whosoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become ... forevermore ... a human juggernaut!\\" The gem channels Cyttorak's power into Marko. The transformation causes a cave-in, and the character is buried and presumably killed, not being heard from again until a sudden assault on the X-Men's headquarters. Xavier recounts the Juggernaut's origin to the X-Men, and after shrugging off the mansion's defenses and brushing aside the X-Men, Marko is seen clearly in the final panel as he confronts Xavier. The X-Men regroup and attack, while Xavier summons Fantastic Four member the Human Torch to aid the mutants; the Torch generates 'pulses' of flame that essentially hypnotize the Juggernaut, distracting him long enough for Angel to remove his helmet, making Marko susceptible to a telepathic attack by Xavier.X-Men #12-13 (July & Sept. 1965).

While Cage is initially against his joining, Professor X telepathically contacts Luke and asks him to reconsider, believing he has a chance at redemption despite what he previously told Cain.

Magik strikes a deal with Cyttorak, who chooses her to become the new host of the Juggernaut's powers. However, the entity transfers the Juggernaut's powers to Colossus instead.

Subsequently, he is taken to the borders of the country of Sharzhad just as the Thunderbolts return from their tumultuous tumble through time, and Satana aids Man-Thing in opening a gateway to the Crimson Cosmos (or possibly an alternate universe where Cain Marko had died while still the Juggernaut). Pushing his hand through, Marko is re-empowered, becoming the Juggernaut once more, just in time to thunder forth and smash through the otherwise unbreakable force field surrounding the country. This allows the Thunderbolts to resolve an otherwise deadly threat to the planet, as had been orchestrated by the Ghost, who had sent the request for Marko's release back through time.Dark Avengers #182.

Cain Marko, finally having found peace‚Äîeven tending a vegetable garden‚Äîsenses the call and, having armed himself, coerces the Vanisher to take him to the Gem's location. He comes into conflict with a team of X-Men (having been alerted by Colossus, who also perceived the call), as well as seekers of the Juggernaut's power such as Man- Killer. Marko and Colossus struggle with one another, only to realize that they have the same goal‚Äîto destroy the Crimson Gem and prevent another avatar being empowered. Ahmet Adbol, the former Living Monolith, claims the Gem and is transformed into an amalgam of Living Monolith and Juggernaut.Amazing X-Men vol. 2 #16‚Äì17. Marvel Comics. As the colossal new Juggernaut wreaks havoc in the countryside, Colossus invokes Cyttorak, and the god responds to his former exemplar. Arguing that the Monolith-Juggernaut will eventually fail Cyttorak, as all his former avatars have done, Colossus challenges him to try something new: empower him enough to kill Cyttorak himself. Apparently daunted by this prospect, the god withdraws his power from Ahmet Abdol and instead empowers another avatar, to a greater extent than any Juggernaut has ever been. However, the new avatar is not Colossus, but once more Cain Marko. Marko is full of rage, which he focuses on the X-Men and specifically Cyclops (who isn't even present), for killing Professor Xavier. Now more powerful than ever and stripped of even his last weaknesses, he feels that Charles Xavier was the only one who ever truly believed in Cain Marko. Colossus attempts to battle the empowered Juggernaut, but dodges Cain's blows rather than fighting him head on. Peter eventually \\"cheats\\" and strikes the sea side cliff edge where they had been fighting, causing Cain to fall into the ocean below, but in the end, he is seen rising from the waves once again.Amazing X-Men vol. 2 #18‚Äì19.

Bobby, thankful for the distraction, engages Cain. At the end of the fight, Iceman encases Juggernaut in an ice cage and rockets him into the nearby river via ice elevator sling-shot. Then he creates some ice simulacrum that carry/swim him down river, removing Cain from the area altogether.Iceman #5. Marvel Comics. A continuation where Iceman #5 left off, Cain is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and is being flown to a secure location but gets accidentally summoned by Dr. Voodoo to the X-Mansion. Cain fights a mixed team of veterans (Rogue, Quicksilver, Wanda, Dr. Voodoo & Wasp) and newbie (Quicksilver's latest girl- friend: Synapse). Once Juggernaut has engaged them, Rogue power punches him away from the team to give them more space. Quicksilver attempts to finish the fight quickly by racing Synapse over to Cain to get his helmet off so she can mentally neutralize him. Pietro quickly gets the helmet off but finds out Cain's wearing a mental protection skull cap underneath. Cain subsequently attacks Synapse, almost killing her. More battle ensues and Dr. Voodoo sends his summoned Cyttorak minions to \\"fix\\" Cain's armor and thus \\"sealing\\" him inside his armor. The little Cyttorak builders then carry Cain back into Cyttorak's realm and Dr. Voodoo closes the portal.Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 #29. Marvel Comics.

Marvel Comics. As the Juggernaut, Marko possesses superhuman strength, being capable of shattering mountains, lifting and using buildings as weapons,Uncanny X-Men #361 (Nov. 1998). Marvel Comics. and extreme durability. Juggernaut is able to generate a mystical force field that grants him additional invulnerability to any physical attack when it is at its maximum.X-Men #13 (Sept. 1965). Marvel Comics. Even when the force field is temporarily absorbed by Thor's hammer, the Juggernaut's natural durability still proves to be great enough to withstand blows from Thor. The Juggernaut is described as physically unstoppable once in motion, does not tire from physical activity, and is able to survive without food, water, or oxygen. The Juggernaut heals quickly, as when he was stabbed through the eyes by Shatterstar, the wounds were healed almost immediately.Spider-Man #16 It is possible for an opponent with sufficient physical or mystical strength of their own to turn the Juggernaut's unstoppable movement against him, by redirecting his motion so that he gets stranded in a position in which he has no escape; both the Hulk and his son, Skaar, have done this physically, and Thor has done it mystically with Mjolnir.World War Hulk: X-Men #3. Marvel Comics.Thor #412. Marvel Comics. The only character to have stopped Juggernaut while he was in motion as an act of pure physical strength was the Hulk while he was War, a horseman of Apocalypse and empowered with Celestial technology.The Incredible Hulk #457.

Trion Juggernaut is capable of altering the size of matter, growing in size, tracking, levitation, absorbing and projecting energy, increasing his own strength, and creating portals through space-time.The Uncanny X-Men #369. Marvel Comics. The character is vulnerable to mental attacks, a weakness that has been exploited via the removal of his helmet, which normally protects him from such. The Juggernaut has circumvented this weakness on occasion by wearing a metal skullcap inside his main helmet. If Juggernaut loses his helmet, he can magically recreate it from available raw materials (as long as he possesses the full power of the gem). After Cyttorak's re-empowering of Cain Marko, his strength and durability were raised to higher levels than ever before, and his vulnerability to mental attacks was negated.Amazing X-Men vol. 2 # 19.

Marvel Comics. What If? There are two different stories of \\"What If\\" that revolve around Juggernaut: *In a reality where Xavier acquires the Crimson Gem rather than Cain, Cain joins forces with Magneto and Xavier's disillusioned students, the X-Men. Believing that Xavier's more ruthless methods contradict his alleged dream of peaceful co- existence and using a telepathy-blocking headband to prevent Xavier from realizing what he is up to, they expel the Juggernaut into space. Cain leaves with Magneto after Xavier's Juggernaut is dispatched.What If? vol. 2 #13 *In What if? Vol. 2 #94, in a reality where Cain successfully defeats the X-Men in their first battle, the Sentinels are thus released in mass numbers without the X-Men to oppose them, resulting in Earth's destruction in their subsequent assault. Although Cain eventually destroys the Sentinels through sheer persistence, he is left alone wandering in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with all other humans, and even animals, having been killed by the radiation released by the Sentinels. In his eagerness for human company, he also unintentionally destroys a hidden enclave of humans and mutants conserved by Magneto.What If? vol. 2 #94. Marvel Comics.

Juggernaut betrays Mystique and smashes through the X-Men's mansion.

Internet parody On February 14, 2006, the parody troupe My Way Entertainment released \\"The Juggernaut Bitch!!\\", an overdub of part of the X-Men animated TV series episode \\"Phoenix Saga (Part 3): The Cry of the Banshee\\". \\"The Juggernaut Bitch!!\\" uses a variety of slang, profanity and non sequiturs through ad-libbing. The parody includes the often-repeated line, \\"Don't you know who the fuck I am? I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!\\" At first, the clip was made available on the duo's college website, but when YouTube became popular, so did the parody. The internet meme became so popular that the line was included in X-Men: The Last Stand during Juggernaut's fight with Kitty Pryde. In June 2006, My Way released a sequel, \\"J2: Juggment Day\\", using footage from the episode \\"Juggernaut Returns\\". On June 10, 2007, My Way released a second sequel, entitled \\"J3: Shadow of the Colossi\\", on their website, using footage from \\"The Unstoppable Juggernaut\\" and \\"Pryde of the X-Men\\". The video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has an achievement called \\"I'm the Juggernaut...\\" which references the parody.

The Parliament meets in the Basque capital, Vitoria-Gasteiz, although the first session of the modern assembly, as constituted by the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, was held in Guernica - the symbolic centre of Basque freedoms - on 31 March 1980.Parlamento Vasco - Servicios > Con√≥cenos > La sede Later in 1980 it started meeting at the premises of the Council of √Ålava. In 1982, it got its own site in a former high school. The symbol of the Parliament is an oaken sculpture by Nestor Basterretxea representing a stylized tree, an allusion to the tradition of Basque political assemblies meeting under a tree, as in Guernica. It is composed of seventy-five deputies representing citizens from the three provinces of the Basque autonomous community. Each province (√Ålava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay) elects the same number of deputies, despite their having very different levels of population. This was chosen to earn support from √Ålava and Navarre, less populated territories. Still, Navarre did not join the autonomous community. The elections are held using closed list proportional representation with seats allocated on a Provincial basis using the D'Hondt method of allocation. To qualify for seats in a particular province, electoral lists must receive at least 3% of the votes cast in that province, including votes \\"en blanco\\" for \\"none of the above.\\" From 1984 to 2001, the election threshold was 5% in each province. Sessions of the Basque Parliament are conducted in both Basque and Spanish, with translation services. The Parliament consists of 75 deputies elected by universal adult suffrage under a system of proportional representation. The last elections, held 12 July 2020, resulted in the following distribution of seats: * Partido Nacionalista Vasco (EAJ-PNV): 31 deputies (39.12% of popular vote) * Euskal Herria Bildu (EH Bildu): 21 deputies (27.84% of popular vote) * Partido Socialista de Euskadi- Euskadiko Ezkerra (PSE-EE / PSOE): 10 deputies (13.64% of popular vote) * Podemos Izquierda Unida (Podemos-IU): 6 deputies (8.03% of popular vote) * Partido Popular + Ciudadanos (PP+Cs): 6 deputies (6.75% of popular vote) * Vox (Vox): 1 deputy (1.96% of popular vote) Antiguo Instituto Ramiro de Maeztu See also * List of Basque Presidents (known as Lehendakari), heads of the Basque government * List of Presidents of the Basque Parliament References External links * Official website of the Basque Parliament (in Basque and Spanish) Parliament Category:Legislatures of the Spanish Autonomous Communities ","title":"Basque Parliament"},{"id":"4529870","text":"Peter Ernest Cowan (3 January 1882 ‚Äì 7 May 1955), usually known as Ernest Cowan, was a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1928 to 1930. Born in Wallaroo, South Australia on 3 January 1882, he was the son of farmer Robert Cowan and Christina n√©e McMartin. Nothing is known of his early life until 1894, when he arrived in Esperance, Western Australia. On 31 October 1914 he married Lilly Mary Prisk, with whom he would have five sons and four daughters. Cowan spent most of his life prospecting for gold on the north-eastern goldfields of Western Australia. In 1918 he was working as a labourer on the Gwalia woodline, and the following year settled at Leonora, where he worked as a timber-cutter and labour. In 1828 he was working as a barman when he successfully contested a Legislative Assembly by-election for the seat of Mount Leonora on a Labor ticket. He held the seat until its abolition at the election of 12 April 1930. In that election he contested the seat of Mount Magnet, but was defeated by the Labor incumbent Michael Troy. From 1934 to 1937, Cowan worked as a labourer at Lake Darlot. In 1939 he worked as a cyanide solutionist at the Victory battery at Leonora. In the general election of 29 April 1944 he contested a Western Australian Legislative Council North East Province seat as an Independent Labor candidate, but was unsuccessful. In 1946 he was working as a shop assistant. Cowan suffered from silicosis in later life. He died at the Wooroloo Sanatorium on 7 May 1955, and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

He made performance history in playing chronological cycles of all 32 piano sonatas by Beethoven over two days in New York, Boston, and London.Balint Vazsonyi profile, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music (2004), pg. 761. Sweet Suffolk Owl During the last six years of his life, he became a commentator in Washington, D.C., on the state of American politics. Early studies From 1945 to 1956, Vazsonyi attended the Franz Liszt Academy of Music from which he earned an Artist Diploma. He made his debut in Budapest at age 12 with the F minor Concerto of J.S. Bach. On 15 December 1956, Vazsonyi fled Budapest on foot for Austria, where he became a pianist in the refugee Philharmonia Hungarica under conductor Antal Dor√°ti. He studied at the Vienna Music Academy with Professor Richard Hauser from 1957‚Äì58 and made his Western debut in the Gro√üer Musikvereinssaal, Vienna in January 1958 as soloist with L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande under conductor Volkmar Andreae. In 1960, upon receiving a scholarship to study with Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi at the School of Music at Florida State University, Vazsonyi moved to the United States, earning a Master of Music degree. Among the last pupils of the master, Vazsonyi became one of the last links in a tradition that stretched back to Franz Liszt. At FSU, he met another Dohn√°nyi student, Barbara Whittington, whom he married on 26 February 1960. Early career From 1960 to 1962, Vazsonyi resided in Z√ºrich, Switzerland and in Wiesbaden, Germany, giving concerts and recording in Europe. From 1962-64, he became Pianist-in-Residence at the newly formed Interlochen Arts Academy where his son, Nicholas Vazsonyi, was born in 1963. He became an American citizen in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1964 and was awarded the Liberty Bell Award the same year. In 1964-78, Vazsonyi moved to London, England with his family for private studies with pianist Dame Myra Hess, from 1964 to her death in 1965. London remained his home base for concertizing in Europe, England, America, and South Africa, recording, and presiding over master classes at Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, New England Conservatory, Catholic University, Peabody, and the University of Washington. Professorship From 1978 to 1984, Vazsonyi was invited to be Professor of Music at Indiana University, Bloomington School of Music where, as well as having a private piano studio, he conducted all doctoral seminars in Piano Literature. In 1982, while still teaching at Indiana University, Bloomington, Balint Vazsonyi earned a Ph.D in History from the University of Budapest, based in part on his seminal monograph of Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi,\\"Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi\\" (1st comprehensive monograph), Editio Musica, Budapest 1971. 70.5477 Egyetemi Nyomda; Nap Kiado. and Budapest 2002 which resulted in a street next to the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest being named for his mentor as well as an official absolving (2002) of false Nazi-sympathizer charges against Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi made after World War II. While a professor at Indiana University School of Music, Vazsonyi held a master class in piano performance. In this weekly seminar, performances were offered critical comments from students and from Professor Vazsonyi. No stranger to the political arena, he exposed his piano students to the realities of the international political climate. Entrepreneurship ‚Äì Telemusic, Inc. In 1983-92, Vazsonyi, founder/CEO of Telemusic, Inc., wrote/produced, along with video conceptualizer and director Nicholas Vazsonyi, four TV/Home Video/DVD films on the lives of Mozart (scripted by Nicholas Vazsonyi), Beethoven (European portions directed by Cash Baxter), Schubert, and Brahms (see TV/Video titles below). With the English actor Sir Anthony Quayle, he leads the viewer through cities of Europe in search of the life and soul of these composers, using costume drama, music video, and musical selections. Mayoral run In 1991, Bloomington, Indiana's Republican mayoral candidate having stepped down with 100 days (3¬Ω months) remaining, Vazsonyi, based on several articles published in Bloomington's The Herald- Times regarding the First Gulf War, was recruited to run. Although his opponent won, he claimed the experience taught him how the U.S. works full circle. Deanship In 1993, Balint Vazsonyi became Dean of Music at the New World School of the Arts in Miami, Florida. In 1995, he was appointed Senior Fellow to the Potomac Foundation in McLean, Virginia and wrote his first political treatise, The Battle for America's Soul. Between 1993-95, he was Honorary Cultural Counselor in America for Hungary (The Republic of Hungary), and a member of the Board of Directors of the Chopin Foundation of the United States and of the Washington Bach Consort. Political philosopher In 1995‚Äì2003, he moved to Washington, D.C. as Senior Fellow of the McLean, Virginia think tank, Potomac Foundation. He then co-founded and became Director of the Center for the American Founding. Vazsonyi stated: \\"We advocate and practice discussion of national issues as they relate to America's founding principles. For continued success, we believe this nation needs to return to the Rule of Law, Individual Rights, the Security of Property, and the same American Identity for all its citizens ... As time progressed, the creation of commissar positions in America acquired the dimensions of a growth industry. The avalanche began with affirmative action officers, equal opportunity officers, judicial inquiry officers, and civil rights divisions. These positions exist for the sole purpose of enforcing a political agenda - an occupation at odds with the very nature of America. Certain college and university departments - departments of education, of communications, of journalism, social studies, and urban planning - became the reliable producers of commissars. Law schools, too, began to churn out graduates trained to serve a specific political agenda, rather than jurisprudence ... Soon, entire government departments were created to function as Commissariats, such as the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Commerce. Several other federal agencies, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, and its sister outfit, for the Humanities, fall into the same category. All these agencies offer services people find useful and employ many capable professionals along with commissars. But they are of the same cloth, for they provide a platform for commissars, lack constitutional legitimacy, and are virtually immune to citizen complaints. Eventually, commissar types found their way into legislatures, the Supreme Court, and the White House. The recent acquisition of the Department of justice as a commissariat, and the growing multitude of commissar judges on federal benches, complete this massive force whose effectiveness - unlike the armies and submarines of the Third Reich or the ICBMs of the Soviet Union - has proved a match for America's awesome industrial, financial, and spiritual strength.\\"Balint Vasonyi, America's Thirty Years' War: Who is Winning (1998). Last years During those years he published and lectured extensively on cultural and political subjects, appeared in The Wall Street Journal and National Review. He wrote a bi-weekly column for The Washington Times, and wrote a weekly, nationally syndicated column for Scripps Howard. His proposals for the application of America's founding principles to the national debates have been printed in the Congressional Record, Heritage Foundation, and Representative American Speeches. His book, America's 30 Years War: Who is Winning?, defining the source of alien ideas subverting America's culture and society, was published by Regnery in 1998. He was a frequent guest on national talk radio and appeared on television shows such as NBC Today, Booknotes on C-SPAN with Brian Lamb, Washington Journal, MSNBC, and Insights with Robert Novak. In 2000, he toured the nation's capitals to promote a national conversation he called Re-Elect America!. The one-hour television documentary about the tour has been aired on WETA-TV, Washington's PBS station. Death Vazsonyi died on 17 January 2003, aged 66, survived by his wife, the couple's son Nicholas and daughter-in-law, Agnes, and several grandchildren. According to his Washington Times obituary, he once played all of Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas in the order they were composed over the course of a single weekend.

Their intention was to make it appear as though it were a traffic accident. Instead of killing Dra≈°koviƒá, who managed to survive the crash, they ended up killing four of his associates: high-ranking Serbian Renewal Movement member Veselin Bo≈°koviƒá (who was also Dra≈°koviƒá's brother-in-law), along with three bodyguards (Zvonko Osmajliƒá, Vuƒçko Rakoƒçeviƒá, and Dragan Vu≈°uroviƒá). Event The target, Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá. On Sunday, 3 October 1999, in the early afternoon hours, Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá and his entourage were traveling in three cars southbound on the Ibar Highway. The trip began in front of Dra≈°koviƒá's house in Belgrade and the destination was Ravna Gora. The original plan was to travel in two cars with Dra≈°koviƒá, his wife Danica, SPO federal MP Gordana Aniƒçiƒá, and Dra≈°koviƒá's personal driver Bane in the jeep followed by the three bodyguards in the black BMW 520 right behind. However, immediately before setting off, Veselin Bo≈°koviƒá, Dra≈°koviƒá's brother-in-law, showed up in his Audi 8 in front of the house and joined the group. He also requested that Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá come over to his car, so they can ride together, which Dra≈°koviƒá did. Thus, the modified driving arrangement was: a jeep with Danica, Gordana, and driver Bane first, followed by the Audi with Bo≈°koviƒá and Dra≈°koviƒá inside it, and finally the three bodyguards Osmajliƒá, Rakoƒçeviƒá, and Vu≈°uroviƒá in the BMW just behind. Bo≈°koviƒá was driving cautiously, and quickly gave up trying to keep up with the jeep driven by Bane that pulled way ahead and out of sight. The bodyguards in the BMW were right behind Bo≈°koviƒá and Dra≈°koviƒá, throughout. Around fifteen minutes past noon, as the two cars were driving down the Ibar Highway through the municipal territory of the village of Petka near Lazarevac, a huge crash occurred. A green-coloured truck traveling in the opposite direction, toward Belgrade, abruptly swerved left into oncoming traffic five meters before the two cars, plowing into and over them. It hit the first car (an Audi) on the driver's side, bouncing it into the corn field, and then slammed into the second car (a BMW) with full force. The BMW went underneath the truck and exploded, incinerating the three people inside it. Reaction Initially reported in Sunday bulletins as a traffic accident with four casualties,U saobracajnoj nesreci poginula cetiri istaknuta clana SPO-a, B92, October 3, 1999 it soon became clear that there was much more to the crash. The very next day, on Monday, Dra≈°koviƒá himself called it a \\"clear attempt on my life\\".Draskovic: Bio je to ocigledan atentat na mene, B92, October 4, 1999 He accused the authorities of 'state terrorism'. Other political factors in Serbia at the time also reacted on the same day. The opposition coalition Alliance for Changes (SZP) called on the Serbian police authorities to \\"investigate every single detail of the crash\\". Speaking as a SZP representative, Democratic Party president Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá said that the traffic accident near Lazarevac looked suspicious. He also relayed his expectation about the authorities \\"providing an immediate and convincing explanation of the event because if that doesn't happen, there will be suspicions that something abnormal occurred\\".Poziv policiji da hitno otkrije detalje nesrece, B92, October 4, 1999 Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) vice president Milorad Jovanoviƒá said that \\"it's too early to discuss the reasons for this tragedy since the police didn't yet provide all the information\\".Poziv policiji da hitno otkrije detalje nesrece, B92, October 4, 1999 The release by the New Democracy political party was the strongest: it clearly referred to the event as an \\"assassination attempt on Dra≈°koviƒá\\" and strongly condemned it.Poziv policiji da hitno otkrije detalje nesrece, B92, October 4, 1999 On Tuesday, 5 October, Veselin Bo≈°koviƒá was buried at Topƒçider cemetery in Belgrade. Many opposition leaders came to the funeral, however no one from the ruling coalition showed up. Eulogizing his brother-in-law, Dra≈°koviƒá gave an impassioned speech: On the following day, Wednesday, 6 October, Zvonko Osmajliƒá, Vuƒçko Rakoƒçeviƒá, and Dragan Vu≈°uroviƒá were being laid to rest at the same cemetery, and Dra≈°koviƒá delivered another impassioned eulogy: Trial (2002‚Äì03) The trial started with four individuals on the indictment list: Nenad Bujo≈°eviƒá, Nenad Iliƒá, Radomir Markoviƒá, and Milan Radonjiƒá. The verdict in what turned out to be only the first trial (presided by judge Miroslav Cvetkoviƒá) was delivered on 30 January 2003. The immediate assassins Nenad Bujo≈°eviƒá and Nenad Iliƒá were sentenced to 15 years in prison each, State Security chief Radomir Markoviƒá received 7 years, while State Security Belgrade Branch chief Milan Radonjiƒá was found not guilty of all charges.Presude u sluƒçaju Ibarska magistrala, BBCSerbian.com, January 30, 2003 Supreme Court appeal The above verdict was subsequently annulled before the Supreme Court and a re-trial was ordered. Repeat trial (2005) The re- trial, which consisted of an expanded indictment list that now also included 8 more individuals (Milorad Ulemek, Mihalj Kertes, Branko ƒêuriƒá, Dragi≈°a Diniƒá, Vidan Mijailoviƒá, and 3 more JSO members), wrapped up on 29 June 2005 in the Belgrade District Court. It resulted in first degree sentences for the following individuals: :*Milorad Ulemek (a former JSO commander), received 15 years for taking part in the assassination attempt. :*five other JSO members (Nenad Iliƒá, Nenad Bujo≈°eviƒá, Du≈°ko Mariƒçiƒá, Branko Berƒçek, and Leonid Milivojeviƒá) also received 15 years each for taking part in the assassination attempt. :*Radomir Markoviƒá (the former Serbian State Security Service chief), received 10 years for helping those that directly carried out the crime by aiding them after they committed it. He was also indicted with a much more serious charge of organizing the assassination attempt, but the court found him not guilty of that. :*Mihalj Kertes (the former Federal Customs director), received 3 years also for aiding the immediate executioners of the assassination attempt after the crime was committed. :*Dragi≈°a Diniƒá (former chief of Serbian Interior Ministry traffic police), received 2 years. :*Vidan Mijailoviƒá (member of Serbian Interior Ministry traffic police), received 1 year. The remaining two individuals on the indictment list were absolved of any responsibility: Milan Radonjiƒá (the former State Security's Belgrade Branch chief) and Branko ƒêuriƒá (the former Police Chief in Belgrade). The sentence was made official on 23 November 2005, almost 5 months after it was delivered, because presiding judge Bojan Mi≈°iƒá took an unusually long amount of time to write it up.Danas pisana presuda za Ibarsku, B92, November 22, 2005 This led to veiled public accusations of time wasting with the intent of sabotaging the appeals process which has a 1-year window from the date of the verdict being delivered, but can only start once the verdict is official. By taking almost 5 months to make the verdict official, judge Mi≈°iƒá effectively made that time period unavailable for appeals, leaving only 7 months for the appeals instead of a full year. Supreme Court appeals Everyone involved with the case (public prosecutor, lawyers, and the accused) appealed the verdict, and the case went before the Supreme Court again between 27 March and 31 March 2006. The Supreme Court's 5-judge council had three options in regards to the district court verdict: upholding the verdict, modifying the verdict, or ordering a partial/full re-trial by partially/fully annulling the verdict. On 16 May 2006, the Supreme Court made its decision public - it fully annulled the verdict and ordered a full re-trial for the second time.Ibarska vraƒáena na ponovno suƒëenje, B92, May 16, 2006Ibarska, treƒái put - Dra≈°koviƒá ogorƒçen, MTS Mondo, May 16, 2006 The prison detentions for all of the accused were extended. Third trial (2006‚Äì07) The third trial, again under the presiding judge Bojan Mi≈°iƒá, ended on 14 February 2007. The verdict was delivered on February 16, 2007. It resulted in the following sentences: :*Milorad Ulemek (former JSO commander), received 15 years for taking part in the assassination attempt. :*Nenad Iliƒá, JSO member and the driver of the truck also received 15 years. :*4 other JSO members (Nenad Bujo≈°eviƒá, Du≈°ko Mariƒçiƒá, Branko Berƒçek, and Leonid Milivojeviƒá) all received 14 years each for taking part in the assassination. :*Radomir Markoviƒá (former Serbian State Security Service chief), received 10 years for helping those that directly carried out the crime by aiding them after they committed it. :*Mihalj Kertes (former Federal Customs director), received 2 and a half years for aiding the immediate executioners of the assassination attempt after the crime was committed. :*Dragi≈°a Diniƒá (former chief of Serbian Interior Ministry traffic police), received 19 months. :*Vidan Mijailoviƒá (member of Serbian Interior Ministry traffic police), received 9 months. The remaining two individuals on the indictment list were again absolved of responsibility: Milan Radonjiƒá (former State Security's Belgrade branch chief) and Branko ƒêuriƒá (former Police Chief in Belgrade). On appeal, the Supreme Court made a decision that the case should be again be re-tried in front of the Supreme Court rather than sending it back to the District Court. Fourth trial (2008) On 3 March 2008, the fourth trial in the Ibar Highway case opened - this time in front of the Serbian Supreme Court's five-person council, which was presided over by judge Dragomir Milojeviƒá. According to the presiding judge the case was to be heard again from beginning to end with old evidence as well as new evidence that surfaced in the meantime.Sluƒçaj ‚ÄûIbarska‚Äù, ƒçetvrti put, Politika, March 4, 2008 On 19 June 2008, the Supreme Court delivered a verdict sentencing Rade Markoviƒá, Milorad Ulemek, Branko Berƒçek, and Nenad Iliƒá to 40 years for the murder of 4 men and the attempted murder of Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá. Nenad Bujo≈°eviƒá was sentenced to 35 years for the same crime, while Du≈°ko Mariƒçiƒá and Leonid Milivojeviƒá got 30 years.Ubicama sa Ibarske magistrale 258 godina robije, Politika, June 20, 2008 Furthermore, the Supreme Court gave out sentences for hiding the evidence: Mihalj Kertes - 18 months, Dragi≈°a Diniƒá - 10 months, and Vidan Mijailoviƒá - 6 months. Branko ƒêuriƒá and Milan Radonjiƒá were once again absolved of responsibility due to lack of any evidence against them. This sentence was final for Kertes, Mijailoviƒá, and Diniƒá while all others had a right to appeal it and did so. Appeal The supreme court met in late October 2009 to discuss their appeals. On 21 December 2009, the appeal verdict was announced and it confirmed all of the sentences for all accused, meaning that their sentences now became final.Konaƒçna presuda za Ibarsku magistralu - Legiji ƒçetvrti put 40 godina, Blic, December 20, 2009 References External links *Draskovic attends crash victim's funeral, BBC, October 5, 1999 *Ibarska magistrala, treƒái put: Profesionalni kukaviƒçluk, Vreme, May 25, 2006 *Ulemeku 15, Markoviƒáu osam godina za Ibarsku, MTS Mondo, February 16, 2007 Category:Assassinations in Serbia Category:1999 in Serbia Category:1999 road incidents Category:Road incidents in Serbia Category:1990s murders in Serbia Category:1999 crimes in Serbia Category:1999 murders in Europe ","title":"Ibar Highway assassination attempt"},{"id":"4529888","text":"Harrigan may refer to: *Harrigan (surname) *Harrigan (TV series), Canadian children's television series *Hop Harrigan, comic-strip aviator *\\"Big John\\" Harrigan, nurturing pedophile in film L.I.E. *\\"Harrigan\\" (song), by George M.

Part of Yamaha's WaveRunner line of watercraft, it was introduced in 1990 and has become one of the most successful stand-up personal watercraft ever made. All SuperJets, including the engine, are hand-built in Japan. Credit for the design is given to Clayton Jacobson II. Prior to the introduction of the new Kawasaki SX-R 1500 four stroke on October 6, 2016, it has been the only stand-up sold by a major manufacturer since the Kawasaki SX-R 800 was discontinued in 2011. There are three engine generations spanning 1990-1993, 1994-1995, and 1996-2020, and three hull generations spanning 1990-1995, 1996-2007, and 2008-2020. 2019 marks the 30th year of production for the SuperJet. The current model SuperJet is powered by a 701cc inline two- cylinder, two-stroke engine. All generations have an upper and lower hull constructed from SMC (sheet molded compound). SMC is a compression moldable composite material made of long strands of glass fibers suspended in a polyester resin. The Yamaha FX-1 is the only other stand-up personal watercraft produced by Yamaha, and was produced in limited numbers from 1994-1995. On August 12, 2020 Yamaha released the new 2021 SuperJet. This is the first complete redesign from the ground up since the introduction in 1990, and marks 30 years of SuperJet history. The hull is entirely new and it is now powered by Yamaha's 1,049cc three-cylinder four-stroke TR-1 marine engine. Model Designations Yamaha numbers its models according to their make (in the case of the SuperJet, all models begin with the letters SJ) followed by the engine size (given in approximate cubic centimeters‚Äî the 650cc referred to as 650 and the 701cc referred to as 700) and the year in which the vehicle was made, given as either a one or two letter designation and increasing by one ‚Äòletter' each full year, with an optional letter placed before the year letter as an amendment code. For example, the letter year designation for the year 1994 for the SuperJet was the letter S, so a SuperJet manufactured in 1994 would have the designation SJ700S. However, Yamaha made engine and chassis changes to the SJ700 for 1996, so appropriately an amendment code was added and a 1996 model has the designation SJ700AU, and in 2002 they increased the amendment by one to ‚Äòroll over‚Äô the letter years so the designation is SJ700BA. The model year 2018 has the designation SJ700BT. There was not a specific amendment code associated with the 2008 hull refresh. SuperJet 1990-1993 (SJ650D,P,Q,R)[Generation 1] The 1990 SuperJet was the first year of Yamaha's stand-up PWC offering.

The current SuperJet (produced by Yamaha Motor and hand-built in Japan) has been visually the same since 1996. The 2008 model was the first year of a new bottom deck, changed for the first time in the history of the SuperJet. This watercraft no longer meets California or New York two-stroke emissions standards as a new vessel (however, previously titled vessels can still be registered in CA). Purchasing a SuperJet new from a dealer will usually require a license from IJSBA as they are classified as a \\"competition use only\\" watercraft, partly due to stringent EPA regulations for two-stroke engines. An annual membership from IJSBA is $65 for the first year as of May 2018, with renewal at $60 per year, if desired. These memberships can be purchased from the dealer in most cases.  Body Updates The new 2008 has the same Roundnose top deck that was introduced in 1996, with a new bottom deck (or hull) incorporating the first changes since 1990 when the SuperJet was released. The new bottom hull has incorporated side sponsons (similar to adding \\"Blowsion tubbies\\") onto the hull. The rear of the hull is also slightly narrower and has deeper strakes for improved tracking. The handle pole on the 2008 SuperJet is 50 mm shorter than previous generation Roundnose SuperJets, which moves the rider forward slightly in the tray.  Mechanical Updates The intake grate, pump, and ride plate are all set back 50 mm rearward compared to the past year SuperJets. The engine remains as the same reliable two-cylinder twin carb as the previous 1996+ years, with no noted mechanical changes. The impeller was updated to a newly designed geometry and made from stainless steel for the first time, in comparison to the previous aluminum design that remained the same throughout 1990-2007. The new impeller design offers large improvements in hookup as well as reduced pump cavitation. The prop driveshaft was changed to a constant diameter over the entire length to increase stiffness, versus previous years in which it is necked down to a smaller diameter in the center section. However, the impeller is backwards compatible with all older models and can be installed on any year SuperJet to replace the original aluminum impeller design.

The hull has also been completely redesigned from the ground up with a new 144mm pump, adjustable steering nozzle, and reboarding grab handle in the tray. The TR-1 marine engine weighs 160lbs and is 30\\"L by 21\\"W by 19\\"H inches in size, producing 100hp. It has an integrated oil tank, ECU and air filter onto the engine.

The coat of arms of Bern, along with the associated flag and heraldic colours, are used both by the Swiss city of Bern and by the canton of the same name. They were also used by the former district of Bern until its abolition in 2009. The coat of arms of Bern is on a red field a yellow diagonal band charged with a black bear walking upwards toward the hoist. The heraldic blazon reads: Gules, on a bend or, a bear passant sable, langued, armed and vilen√© of the field. The flag of Bern is square and depicts the coat of arms. The heraldic colours of Bern are red and black.  Heraldic beast  The hunt for the bear as depicted in the Tschachtlan chronicles. Note the original coat of arms above the gate. The heraldic beast of Bern is the bear. It has long served as namesake, emblem, mascot and ‚Äî at times ‚Äî personification of Bern. The founding legend has it that Duke Berthold V of Z√§hringen vowed to choose as namesake the first animal his hunt met in the wood that was to be chopped down for the new city. Then, as Konrad Justinger's chronicle puts it: :Nu wart des ersten ein ber gevangen, darumb wart die stat bern genempt; und gab do den burgeren in der stat ein wappen und schilt, nemlich einen swarzen bern in einem wissen schilt in gender wise. :Then they caught a bear first, which is why the city was called Bern; and so the citizens had their coat and shield, which was a black bear in a white shield, going upright.Quoted from Vinzenz Bartlome / Urs M. Zahnd, Gr√ºndung und Sage, in: Schwinges, op.cit., p. 23. The bear motif is in evidence as early as 1224 (on city seals), and has remained in use ever since. Today the city of Bern still has bears featured directly outside its Altstadt in the B√§rengraben.  Coat of arms  The Bern-Rych coat of arms from the Berner Chronik of Michael Stettler, 1620. As Justinger's chronicle reveals, Bern's original coat of arms was an upright black bear on a white shield (which is, incidentally, the coat of arms of Berlin). In the 13th century, the coat of arms changed to the one in use today. The modern coat of arms is already recognisable in Alsatian mercenary songs of 1375 reported by Justinger. The change, according to the chroniclers, was linked to the Battle of the Schosshalde in 1289 against the troops of Duke Rudolf II of Austria, son of Emperor Rudolf II von Habsburg. According to Justinger, a Bernese salvaged a part of the ensign as the fortunes of war turned against Bern, and Tschudi recounts: :Und als die von Bern bis ze der zit in ir paner den bern in wijssem veld gefuert, wars damals verendert in ein rot veld, von wegen das die paner ... von bluot was rot worden. :Until then, those of Bern carried the bear in a white field, but the field turned red that day, as the banner was drenched in blood.Quoted from Ladner, op.cit. The chronicler Stumpf then adds that the diagonal band changed from silver to gold to celebrate the eventual Bernese victory over the House of Habsburg. The coat of arms of the State and Republic of Bern, around 1790. As long as Bern still considered itself (at least formally) to be part of the Holy Roman Empire, subject to the Emperor, this was reflected in its coat of arms. The imperial eagle was placed above the Bernese shield, constituting a compound coat of arms known as the Bern-Rych, or \\"Berne-Empire\\". Eventually, Bern formally gained the full sovereignty it had long since de facto possessed with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, but it was not until 1700 that the eagle was replaced with the Republic's trefoil crown that signified ultimate temporal power.See Karl W√§lchli, Von der Reformation bis zur Revolution, in: Peter Meyer (ed.), Berner - deine Geschichte, B√ºchler Verlag, Bern 1981, , p. 129.

Like all Hasidism it is based on the teachings and customs of Chasidut as taught by the Baal Shem Tov, in turn based on the Kabbalistic works of Rabbi Isaac Luria (also known as the Arizal).  The first Rebbe  The first Rebbe of Strashelye was Rabbi Aharon HaLevi Horowitz, a student of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745-1812), the founder of the Chabad Chassidic school of thought.Rabinowicz, H. The World of Hasidism. Hartmore House. (1970): p.130 A charismatic figure As Rebbe, Rabbi Aharon was said to be incredibly charismatic. Stories related by the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, claimed that some Chassidim of Rabbi Dovber went to visit Rabbi Aharon and were so taken by his charisma that they stayed despite their promises to the contrary.  Rabbi Aaron and the second Rebbe of Chabad-Lubavitch  While both Strashelye and Lubavitch consider Rabbi Shneur Zalman to have been the first rebbe of their respective schools, the former considered Rabbi Aharon HaLevi Horowitz to be his successor. The latter consider Rabbi Dovber Schneuri (the son of Rabbi Schneur Zalman) the second rebbe. In as much as that is the case, the Strashelye branch of Chabad Chassidus began in 1812, when Rabbi Shneur Zalman died.  Disagreement over prayer  While both were good friends, Rabbi Dovber and Rabbi Aharon disagreed about the emphasis on, and correct method of, emotional expression in Chassidic prayer. According to Rabbi Dovber,as laid out in Kuntres Hispa'alus (Tract on Ecstasy) the greatest service a Jew can perform in worship is to totally nullify himself before The Creator. Therefore, maintained Rabbi Dovber, a person's meditation can appear to be cold and emotionless on the exterior, where the prayer causes the person praying to feel oneself one with The Creator. To that end, Rabbi Dovber prayed with great D'veikus (cleaving), rather than with Hispaylus (excitement), where the one praying gets excited over the Creator but remains, in his own feeling and understanding, a separate entity and existence. Rabbi Dovber prayed while perfectly still, hardly moving. His outward countenance remained completely unaffected. It is important to note this mode of davening was something personal to him, as he was able to conceal his emotions, rather than something he recommended for everyone. When the Rebbe DovBer noticed that his chassidim (followers) thought that they should be devoid of any emotional appearance, he wrote a public letter stating that this is wrong. His disagreement with Rabbi Aharon was rather that he felt that there must be an understanding of Godliness and a cleaving, in other words that one's emotional feeling be a lasting one, not one that would evaporate after a short time. Rabbi Aharon disagreed, maintaining that it is acceptable and even commendable for a Chassid to become outwardly excited during prayer. Rabbi Shneur Zalman himself was known to pound his fist so hard on the wall while praying that he sometimes literally bled from his hand. Rabbi Aharon displayed similar excitement and intensity during prayer. Moreover, he encouraged others to similarly express themselves openly during prayer.  Disagreement over education  Furthermore, the two disagreed about the extent to which the deepest elements of Chassidic wisdom should be taught openly. Rabbi Dovber, in his magnum opus Sha'ar HaYichud (The Gate of Unity), explains the entire spiritual superstructure of creation. Rabbi Aharon, on the other hand, argued that it was dangerous to discuss certain aspects of creation because it could lead a person to inadvertently view God anthropomorphically. Therefore, it is merely enough for a person to know that God is so great that His Existence precludes the existence of any created beings, but that created beings exist, nonetheless. This very paradox is a testimony to the greatness of God. While Rabbi Aharon's teachings involve some of the deepest aspects of Kabbalistic wisdom, they nonetheless entreat the reader to use the deep intellectual wisdom of Kabbala in order to inspire simple love and fear for God. This was the foundation of Rabbi Dovber's doctrine as well, and in fact a cornerstone in Rabbi Shneur Zalman's own Tanya. The difference lay primarily in the outer (Chitzonius) emotional conduct Rabbi Aharon expected of his followers, and the intense manifestation of self-effacement Rabbi Dovber expected of his.  Succession  At some point before Rabbi Shneur Zalman's passing, Rabbi Dovber and Rabbi Aharon had a disagreement. It is not known what the disagreement was about. What is known is that Rabbi Aharon left Liadi (where both he, Rabbi Shneur Zalman and Rabbi Dovber lived), and settled in his home town of Strashelye. After Rabbi Shneur Zalman died, Rabbi Dovber moved to the city of Lubavitch. Seeking to become the leader of the Chabad school, Rabbi Dovber became the Rebbe of the Lubavitch school of Chabad Chassidus. Rabbi Aharon, similarly seeking to be the leader of the Chabad school, became the Rebbe of the Strashelye school of Chabad Chassidus. The two competing schools held strongly to the ideological distinctions between their leaders.  Works  Rabbi Aharon's two books were based on Rabbi Shneur Zalman's magnum opus, Tanya. Rabbi Aharon's first book, Sha'arei HaYichud ve'Ha'emuna (The Gates of Unity and Faith), is based on the section of Tanya of a similar name. In it, Rabbi Aharon argues that the corresponding part of Tanya was incomplete, and that it is therefore necessary to learn his book in order to understand it fully. Sha'arei HaYichud v'HaEmuna focuses on the creation of the universe, and the universe's relationship with God. It develops the concept of pele (wonder), which refers to the paradox caused by God's and the universe's simultaneous existence. It then argues that one will never \\"understand\\" God, because God is incomparable with created existence. Therefore, the closest thing man can come to \\"grasping\\" God is to meditate on the pele , and to constantly desire to understand God further. The book further elaborates on the relationship between the universe, God, and the Ten Sefiros. The second of his books is called Sha'arei HaAvoda (The Gates of Divine Service). It is based on the first book of the Tanya, which outlines the specific divine service of the Beinoni (the \\"Average Man\\"; see the article on Tanya). It was in this book, and in Avodas HaLevi, that Rabbi Aharon systematized his approach to divine service: Rabbi Aharon emphasized the importance of heartfelt emotions as a tool of connecting with the Divine. He argued that, contrary to Rabbi Dovber Schneuri's position, cold and intellectual contemplation cannot lead to true self-nullification. Only by openly and emotionally desiring to cleave to God can one attain something approaching nullification before the Infinite (the highest goal of Chabad Chassidism). Rabbi Dovber, by contrast, called that approach a glorification of the self. Rabbi Aharon's students compiled many of the oral discourses that Rabbi Aharon gave, and some of the discourses that he either wrote himself or transcribed from discourses given by Rabbi Shneur Zalman. That compilation is called Avodas HaLevi. While his books are not commonly studied within Chabad circles today, they are widely respected for their scholarly insights and broad scope. Furthermore, the Toldos Avraham Yitzchak Rebbe instructed his Chassidim to study Rabbi Aharon's books. The discourses constitute explanations of passages in the Torah, or concepts in Torah thought, in the light of his Chassidic outlook.  The second Rebbe  After Rabbi Aharon died, his son, Rabbi Haim Raphael HaLevi ben Aaron of Staroselye (d. 1842), became rebbe in his place.Ehrlich, Avrum. The Leadership of Dovber. Leadership in the Habad Movement. (Chapt. 11). Jerusalem: Jason Aronson, 2000. https://www.academia.edu/1316532/Leadership_in_the_Habad_MovementBeck, Atara. \\"Is Chabad Lubavitch\\". Jerusalem Post. August 16, 2012. http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Judaism/Is-Chabad-Lubavitch However, the dynasty did not last into the next generation. Many chassidim of the Strashelye returned to Chabad-Lubavitch in the third generation, accepting the Tzemach Tzedek as their Rebbe.

The group was founded in March 1981 in Los Angeles, California and continued with various personnel changes through 2011. The original members of the EAR Unit were Dorothy Stone (flute); James Rohrig (clarinet); Amy Knoles and Daniel Kennedy (percussion); Gaylord Mowrey and Michael McCandless (piano); Robin Lorentz and Mary Terranova (violin); Erika Duke (cello); and Rand Steiger (conductor). By 1983 Terranova, Kennedy and McCandless had departed, and Arthur Jarvinen (percussion) and Lorna Eder (piano) joined. After many years with the same personnel, changes began to occur and one by one original members departed and new performers joined the group. Amy Knoles is the only remaining original member, along with longtime pianist Vicki Ray, and violinist Eric KM Clark. The EAR Unit was formed at the California Institute of the Arts in 1981 by a group of students who had all been performing in the CalArts 20th-Century Players under the direction of Stephen \\"Lucky\\" Mosko. Inspired by their experiences with Mosko, and aware that Los Angeles at the time did not have a resident contemporary music ensemble, Steiger and Rohrig gathered a group of colleagues together after a rehearsal and in the meeting that followed in the CalArts Cafeteria the idea for the group was developed. The name EAR Unit was chosen sometime later, after many weeks of debate. In 1983 the EAR Unit performed a notorious concert at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (one of the first of over 100 they would play there) featuring the West Coast premiere of Elliott Carter's Triple Duo, Louis Andriessen's \\"Hoketus\\" a satirical work written for the occasion by Nicholas Slonimsky, and the premiere of While you were Art, by Frank Zappa. Zappa asked the EAR Unit to perform the work silently while playing a synthesized recording, and they complied with his wishes, learning the piece and matching the recording precisely. But after the concert he told the Los Angeles Times that the statement of the piece \\"is that the whole of serious music in Los Angeles is as fake as the finger-synching in the piece.\\" In the 1980s the EAR Unit often juxtaposed strikingly different works on the same program. At one of the first concerts in 1982, in a bank building in downtown Los Angeles, they presented a program that included works by Steve Reich, Pierre Boulez, Frederic Rzewski, and Donald Martino. Later, in San Francisco they combined Martino's Noturno with Stockhausen's Stimmung, and Subotnick's Key to Songs. Since 1987 the California EAR Unit had been Ensemble-in-Residence at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. During that time they have presented over 500 premieres of musical works. They now hold court at REDCAT in the Disney Hall Complex in downtown Los Angeles. See www.earunit.org for more information. In 1999 The EAR Unit received a Letter of Distinction from the American Music Center. Among the many other composers the EAR Unit has commissioned and premiered are Louis Andriessen, Eve Beglarian, Henry Brant, Kitty Brazelton, Joan LaBarbara, Annea Lockwood, Scott Lindroth, Robert Paterson (composer), Mel Powell, Terry Riley, Erkki-Sven T√º√ºr, Wadada Leo Smith, Ann Millikan, Nicholas Frances Chase and Julia Wolfe.

Biography Kahle studied orientalism and theology in Marburg and Halle. He attained his doctorate in 1898. He worked as a Lutheran pastor. He studied semitic philology in Cairo between 1908 and 1918. In 1918, he was promoted to a full professorship (Ordinary professor) at Gie√üen University, a chair previously held by Friedrich Schwally.

After his wife helped a Jewish neighbor whose shop was ransacked during the Kristallnacht of 1938, the family was persecuted by the Nazis. Kahle immigrated to England where he joined the University of Oxford in 1939, having been dismissed from his university post in Bonn, owing in great part to the fact that he had a Polish rabbi (Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg) as an assistant. At Oxford he gained two further doctorates. During this period at Oxford he suffered the personal tragedy of his son Paul's early death. Kahle returned to Germany after the war, where he pursued his research as professor emeritus. His principal academic renown is as editor of the Hebrew Bible.

It was one of the three main kingdoms of the ancient Tamil country. Their early capitals were Urayur and Kaveripattinam. Along with Pandyas and Cheras, Chola history goes back to the period where written records were scarce. Sources Ancient Tamil Nadu contained three monarchical states, headed by kings called Vendhar and several chieftaincies, headed by the chiefs called by the general denomination Vel or Velir.K.A.N. Sashtri, A History of South India, pp 109‚Äì112 Still lower at the local level there were clan chiefs called kizhar or mannar.'There were three levels of redistribution corresponding to the three categories of chieftains, namely: the Ventar, Velir and Kilar in descending order. Ventar were the chieftains of the three major lineages, viz Cera, Cola and Pandya. Velir were mostly hill chieftains, while Kilar were the headmen of settlements...' ‚Äî The Tamil area had an independent existence outside the control of these northern empires. The Tamil kings and chiefs were always in conflict with each other mostly over property. The royal courts were mostly places of social gathering rather than places of dispensation of authority; they were centres for distribution of resources.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India, p 129 The names of the three dynasties, Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras, are mentioned in the Pillars of Ashoka (inscribed 273‚Äì232 BCE) inscriptions, among the kingdoms, which though not subject to Ashoka, were on friendly terms with him.'Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as Tamraparni...' ‚ÄîK.A.N. Sastri, The C≈çƒªas, 1935 p 20 The king of Kalinga, Kharavela, who ruled around 150 BCE, mentioned in the famous Hathigumpha inscription of the confederacy of the Tamil kingdoms that had existed for over 100 years. Another source for the available information of the early Cholas is the early Tamil literature of the Sangam Period. Karikala Chola was the most famous early Chola. He is mentioned in a number of poems in the Tamil Sangam literature.Pattinappaalai, Porunaraatruppadai and a number of individual poems in Akananuru and Purananuru have been the main source for the information we attribute now to Karikala. See also K.A.N. Sastri, The Colas, 1935 There are also brief notices on the Chola country and its towns, ports and commerce furnished by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (Periplus Maris Erythraei). Periplus is a work by an anonymous Alexandrian merchant, written in the time of Domitian (81 ‚Äì 96 CE) and contains precious information of the Chola country. Writing half a century later, the geographer Ptolemy has more to tell us about the Chola country, its port and its inland cities. Mahavamsa, a Buddhist text, also recounts a number of conflicts between the inhabitants of Ceylon and the Tamil immigrants from Chola Country. Chronicles such as the Yalpana Vaipava Malai and stone inscriptions like Konesar Kalvettu recount that Kulakkottan, an early Chola king and descendant of Manu Needhi Cholan, was the restorer of the ruined Koneswaram temple and tank at Trincomalee in 438 CE, the Munneswaram temple of the west coast, and as the royal who settled ancient Vanniar. Early Cholas The inscriptions of the Medieval Cholas are replete with history about the Early Chola kings. The Cholas were looked upon as descended from the sun. These historic incidents speak of the Chola king Kantaman, supposed contemporary of the sage Agastya, whose devotion brought the river Kavery into existence. There is also the story of the king Manu who sentenced his son to death for having accidentally killed a calf. Mahavamasa portrays King Elara who was defeated by Duttha Gamini (c. 3rd century BCE) as the just king who '..had a bell with a rope attached at the head of his bed, so that all who sought redress might ring it..'. King Sibi who rescued a dove from a hawk by giving his own flesh to the hungry hawk was also part of the early Chola history. These historic incidents received enormous emphasis in the later Chola period in the long mythical genealogies incorporated into the copper-plate charters of the 10th and 11th centuries. The earliest version of this is found in the Anbil Plates which gives fifteen names before Vijayalaya Cholan including the historical ones of Karikala, Perunarkilli and Kocengannan. The Thiruvalangadu Plate swells this list to forty-four, and the Kanyakumari Plate runs up to fifty-two. There are other lists gathered from literary works such as Kalingathuparani. No two of these lists agree, although some names and details are common to all. The chola kings namely dharmavarcholan and killivalavan developed the shrine of Srirangam into big temple seen now. They laid the Basic foundations and primary Buildings. Killi, Thiru Mangai, Kulasekaran, Rajamahendra and Thiru Vikrama were named in the Sri Ranganathar temple in Tiruchchirappalli as being ancestors of Killivallavan. Dharmavarma was another ancestor of Killivallavan, possibly his father.

Due to this, we know of several rulers, but not their chronology. All three kings have been portrayed as fighting the war or involved in feeding both the armies at that legendary war. Karikala Chola Karikala Chola (c. 90 BCE) stands pre-eminent amongst all those mentioned in Pattinappaalai. Karikala's father was Ilamcetcenni, a brave king and a hard fighter. 'Karikala' means 'elephant feller' or 'charred leg', which is assumed to be a reference to an accident by fire which befell the prince early in his life. Pattinappaalai describes this accident and the enterprising way in which the prince escaped and established himself in the Chola throne. Pattinappalai is a long poem on the then Chola capital Kaveripattinam. This work also describes the numerous battles Karikala fought against the other two Tamil kings in one of which the Chera king was disgraced (received a wound on his back) and committed suicide. Karikala thus broke the confederacy that was formed against him and established hegemony over Pandyas and Cheras. Kallanai / Grand Anicut built by Karikala Cholan, on the River Kaveri, near Tiruchirappalli In later times Karikala was the subject of many legends found in the Cilappatikaram and in inscriptions and literary works of the 11th and 12th centuries. They attribute to him the conquest of the whole of India up to the Himalayas and the construction of the flood banks, Grand Anicut, of the Kaveri River with the aid of his feudatories. These legends however are conspicuous by their absence in the works of Sangam. Nalankilli and Nedunkilli The poet Kovur Kilar mentions a protracted civil war between two Chola chieftains Nalankilli and Nedunkilli. Nedunkilli shut himself in a fort in Avur, which was being besieged by Mavalattan, Nalankilli's younger brother. The poet chided Nedunkilli to come out and fight like a man instead of causing untold misery to the people of the city. In another poem, the poet begs both the princes to give up the civil war as whoever wins, the loser will be a Chola. Kocengannan Kalavali by Poygayar mentions the Chola King Kocengannan and his battle with the Chera king Kanaikkal Irumporai. The Chera was taken prisoner and Poygayar, who was a friend of the Chera, sang a poem praising the Chola King Kochchenganan in 40 stanzas. The Chola king, pleased with the work, released the Chera. Kalavali describes the battle fought at Kalumalam, near the Chera capital. Kocengannan is one of the 63 nayanars. Kocengannan became the subject of many instances in later times and is portrayed as a pious Siva devotee who built many fine temples for Siva along the banks of the river Kaveri. Social conditions Sangam literature gives an unusually complete and true picture of the social and economic conditions during the early chola period. The culture is best described as an amalgam of the Dravidian and Aryan. The stories of Mahabharata and Ramayana were well known to the Tamil people, shown by the claims of some kings to have fed both the opposing army in the Mahabharata War. The claim that Sibi, who gave his own flesh to save a dove, as a Chola is obviously influenced by northern legends. The land of the Cholas was fertile and there was ample food. Sangam poems say that in the Chola country watered by the river Kaveri, in a space in which an elephant could lie, one can produce enough grain to feed seven. Hereditary monarchy was the prevailing form of government. Disputed succession and civil war was not uncommon. The sphere of the state activity was limited. In a society steeped in respect for custom, even the most perverse dictator could not have done much harm. The Chola monarchs were approachable by subjects and justice was meted out directly by the king in most occasions. This is in marked contrast to the magnificent empires of the later Cholas where the Emperor was kept much away from contact with the lay people. The kings often took the field in person in battles and if the kings was killed or wounded in battle, his army immediately gave up the fight and surrendered. The trade that flourished between the Chola country and the ancient Roman Empire is given in much detail by Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 75 CE).

The highway also runs through the cities of Casa Grande, Eloy and Marana. Segments of the highway are referred to as either the Papago Freeway, Inner Loop or Maricopa Freeway within the Phoenix area and the Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway outside metro Phoenix. Route description Interstate 10 through Arizona is designated a \\"Purple Heart Trail,\\" after those wounded in combat who receive the Purple Heart. The western terminus is located at the California border at the Colorado River in La Paz County where I-10 continues westward into California towards Los Angeles. Here, the same physical road is signed as both I‚Äë10 and U.S. Route 95 (US 95). Western segment The highway runs east by northeast past Ehrenberg and Quartzsite and then turns to an east by southeast orientation just before the junction for US 60\\\\. It continues this path entering Maricopa County and the Phoenix Metro area. The route turns east by northeast again at the junction for State Route 85 (SR 85) northwest of downtown Buckeye, and turns due east at Verrado Way (exit 120). Here, the speed limit drops from . The landscape by this point is largely urban. Papago Freeway From there, I-10 traverses through the communities of Goodyear, Avondale and Tolleson, meeting with local streets and area freeways such as Loop 303 (at the former Cotton Lane interchange, exit 124) and the Loop 101 Agua Fria Freeway along the way. By December 2019, the simple diamond interchange with 59th Avenue (exit 138) was totally rebuilt, transforming it into the first of two junctions with the Loop 202 Ed Pastor Freeway. As it makes its way through Phoenix, the highway meets with I‚Äë17 and US 60 for the first time just northwest of downtown at The Stack. Inner Loop East of The Stack, I-10 forms the north edge of downtown. Near 3rd Avenue, the highway enters a half-mile tunnel () that runs under a park and the central branch of the City of Phoenix Library. Emerging past 3rd Street, the highway continues due eastward for another before coming to another interchange for Route 51 and Loop 202 (second of three junctions with the latter), called the Mini Stack. At this interchange, I‚Äë10 turns southward for about , passing near Sky Harbor Airport and reaching the second junction with I‚Äë17/US 60. Here, I‚Äë17 terminates as I‚Äë10 skews eastward again. After this junction, the highway is co-signed with US 60\\\\. Maricopa Freeway Continuing southeast over the Salt River and eastward, I‚Äë10 and US 60 enter Tempe and meets with SR 143\\\\. Then, at the Broadway Curve, the freeway turns southward again, with US 60 splitting off to become its own freeway. I‚Äë10 continues southward running along the city borders of Phoenix on the west, and Tempe, Guadalupe, Tempe again, and finally Chandler on the east. Immediately north of the Gila River Indian Community, I‚Äë10 has its third and final intersection with Loop 202\\\\. Past Loop 202, the highway turns to a more south by southeast direction going through the Gila River Indian Community and entering Pinal County. Broadway Curve As of a 2006 estimate, the Broadway Curve portion of I‚Äë10 in Tempe carries an average of 294,000 vehicles per day. This number is predicted to increase by over 150,000 to approximately 450,000 by the year 2025. This section of I‚Äë10 is currently twelve lanes wide, and is the widest section of freeway in the valley. A study is underway to determine whether widening the Broadway Curve to double its current width to 24 lanes is feasible. Eastern segment After exiting the Phoenix metropolitan area, I‚Äë10 continues southward into Casa Grande intersecting I‚Äë8 before heading southeast towards Tucson, paralleling the Santa Cruz River. Several projects have occurred recently, including construction of a new exit at Twin Peaks Rd in Marana and widening of I‚Äë10 from Prince Rd to I-19 in Tucson to four lanes in each direction, which was later extended to Ruthrauff Rd/El Camino Del Cerro.https://www.azdot.gov/projects/south-central/I-10-from-Ruthrauff-Road- to-Prince-Road-Widening/overview|publish=AZDOT After I-10's junction with I-19, I-10 heads southeast towards Benson and Willcox before entering New Mexico. History Entering from California I‚Äë10 in Arizona was laid out by the Arizona Highway Department in 1956-58 roughly paralleling several historic routes across the state. Particularly east of Eloy, it follows the Butterfield Stage and Pony Express routes, and loops south to avoid the north‚Äìsouth Basin and Range mountains prevalent in the state. In fact, the route from its junction with I‚Äë8 east to New Mexico is almost exactly the same route used by the old horse-drawn stagecoaches, which had to go from waterhole to waterhole and avoid the hostile Apache Indians. This is why I-10 is more of a north‚Äìsouth route between Phoenix and Tucson than east‚Äìwest. The Southern Pacific Sunset Route line had to take the route of least hills, and in the 1920s highways were laid down next to the trains across southern Arizona. When the project was being designed in the 1950s, the Arizona Highway Department fought for a nearly straight-shot west from Phoenix for the new freeway, instead of angling northwest out of Phoenix along US 60/US 70/US 89, through Wickenburg. Wickenburgers battled to bring the freeway through their city but lost that battle. The detour up through Wickenburg was logical decades earlier, when nearly all U.S. highways through Arizona were laid out along railroad tracks, and US 60/US 70 was routed mostly parallel to the Santa Fe rail tracks east of Wickenburg, and the Arizona and California Railway west to Vicksburg. The two old federal routes then struck west across the desert and state line, picking up the Southern Pacific mainline at Indio, California, and I-10 overlies the old roads most of that distance. West of Phoenix Interstate 10 between Blythe, California, and Quartzsite, Arizona Moving east from the California line at Ehrenburg, I-10 follows the old route of US 60/US 70 for the first east from Blythe, California. In 1960, this westernmost stretch of I-10 was built from near the Colorado River east to the future spot where the \\"Brenda Cutoff\\" section of I-10 would connect a decade later. Until the early 1970s, this was the last freeway stretch until Phoenix. The \\"Brenda Cutoff\\" was named for a gas station on the old road just east of the fork where US 60 now terminates at I-10. Now an obscure name, \\"Brenda Cutoff\\" was the working title that the Arizona Highway Department called the stretch of freeway from US 60 to near Buckeye. The Brenda Cutoff paralleled old sand roads used in the 1920s for Phoenix-Los Angeles traffic, but mostly abandoned after US 60/US 70 was built to the north, through Wickenburg. The Brenda Cutoff's opening on June 18, 1973 was eagerly awaited and was a big deal in newspapers in Phoenix and Los Angeles. It saved motorists from having to drive through Glendale, Sun City, Wickenburg and Salome, about out of the way, and it eliminated about of two-lane highway. But the freeway was opened only as far east as Tonopah, and heavy traffic was routed down narrow county roads through the desert and fields between Tonopah and Buckeye. In addition, there was only one very-small gas station on the very-long route between Buckeye and Quartzsite, on the old county road at the tiny crossroads of Palo Verde. Signs warning \\"No Services Next 106 Miles\\" were posted at either end of the Brenda Cutoff those first few years. The freeway was extended past Tonopah as far east as Phoenix's western fringes (at Cotton Lane) in about 1974. I-10's freeway section ended in Goodyear until the controversial Papago Freeway was finished across the western Valley of the Sun in 1990. During the \\"west valley gap\\" years, westbound I-10 traffic was routed off the Maricopa Freeway at 19th Avenue in Phoenix, and stayed on the access road as it curved past the Durango Curve. Los Angeles-bound traffic then turned left on Buckeye Road and followed the \\"TO 10\\" signs down Buckeye Road (first marked US 80 until 1977, then SR 85) for nearly 15 years. Phoenix metropolitan area The interstate's route through Phoenix was hotly contested in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. A plan proposed by the Arizona Department of Transportation involved monstrous block-sized 270-degree \\"helicoil\\" interchanges at Third Avenue and Third Street that would connect motorists to freeway lanes in the air, but voters killed it in 1973 as a result of opposition from the Arizona Republic newspaper and a growing nationwide anti-freeway sentiment. Voters on election day were treated to a photo depiction on the front page of the newspaper that in later years was shown to have drastically-overstated the freeway's height, but there is no question the proposed viaducts and helicoils would have been a visual gash across central Phoenix. Southern terminus of I-17 in Phoenix Beginning in 1961, a stub of what is now the Inner Loop portion of I‚Äë10 was built northward from the Maricopa Freeway (then I‚Äë10) along 20th Street, ending north at Buckeye Road. This stub was originally designated I-510. The Inner Loop name was given to it in 1969, at which time the highway changed numbers, to I-410. The I-10/I-510 interchange was the first multi-level interchange in Arizona and lasted until the Inner Loop was built as a real freeway in the 1980s. This putative freeway was two lanes in each direction and would have been hopelessly inadequate as a leg of the Inner Loop as it was intended. After 1973, Arizona engineers favored a more-modest plan to link I-10 with I‚Äë17 at the \\"Durango Curve\\" near 19th Avenue at Buckeye Road, and avoid the \\"Moreland Corridor\\" alignment of the Papago Freeway by adopting a route south of Buckeye Rd. In 1983, ADOT unveiled the current below grade plans on Moreland Street, three blocks south of McDowell Road. Despite some local opposition, I-10 was finally completed in central Phoenix on the Inner Loop alignment, north of Van Buren Street, on August 10, 1990. The state is now considering a reliever freeway in West Phoenix, parallel to I-10 on the old Durango Street corridor, and was originally designated as Route 801, which has since been changed to SR 30\\\\. The original 1962 alignment of I-10 through Phoenix was on the Black Canyon and Maricopa Freeways, now signed as I-17 and US 60, starting at about Grand Avenue. From 1962 to 1974, I‚Äë10 in Phoenix ended at 40th Street, and truck traffic through Phoenix and Mesa was directed to use Arizona Route T-69 via 40th Street south and Baseline Road east to connect to SR 87 and SR 93, the shortcuts to Tucson. The I-10 signs were moved from the Maricopa Freeway to the Papago Freeway/Inner Loop alignments when it opened in 1990 - the last gap of I-10 to be completed between Santa Monica and Jacksonville. This was the only time in Arizona where the posted freeway was moved from one road to another: the state never posted Interstate signs on older state or U.S. highways. ADOT instead made frequent use of interstate shields with the word \\"TO\\" above and arrows below the shield. For several years in the early 1970s an orphan section of I-10 was opened between Baseline Road and Williams Field Road (now Chandler Blvd.) but was not marked as any highway, nor was it connected to the rest of the Interstate Highway System. ADOT, it seems, did not want to divert trucks down from T-69 in Guadalupe down into the cotton fields west of Chandler. This section got its interstate signs when the freeway south to Tucson was completed in about 1970, and the \\"Broadway Curve\\" was connected a year or so later‚Äîfor almost two years, I-10 traffic used Baseline Road and 40th Street through the Japanese flower gardens until the last link between Tucson and Phoenix opened in about 1972. From 1958 to 1972, the interstate was unmarked south from Tempe and Mesa, and traffic used either SR 87 through Coolidge or SR 93 through Casa Grande, or US 80/US 89 through Mesa and Florence. I‚Äë10 signs reappeared at the town of Picacho, the 1962-1970 western terminus of the freeway from Tucson. I‚Äë10 was widened from Verrado Way to Loop 101, a total of . This included a new HOV lane from Dysart Road (Exit 129) to Loop 101, later adding a HOV lane from Estrella Pkwy (exit 126) to Dysart Road. From Estrella Pkwy to Verrado Way, an additional lane was added. New interchanges have been added, whereas Citrus Road has a new exit at 123 and Sarival Avenue has a new exit at 125. Southeast of Phoenix The road from Casa Grande to Tucson was originally SR 84 and SR 93, and when it was rebuilt as a freeway in 1961-62 it was cosigned as I‚Äë10 and routes 84 and 93 through 1966, when 84 was truncated at Picacho. This section of interstate was completed in 1961, and forced the demolition of the town center at Marana, which has never really recovered. The freeway through Tucson, which was rebuilt and widened in stages from 1989 to 2014, with frontage roads added, was originally signed as SR 84 from Miracle Mile to Sixth Avenue. SR 77) in Tucson The original highway from Casa Grande to Tucson entered the Old Pueblo via Miracle Mile, a road modeled after German Autobahns but without overpasses or an exclusive right of way. Traffic circles at either end of Miracle Mile were the best Tucson could come up with in 1937. The section of Miracle Mile West stretching between Miracle Mile and the Southern Pacific overpass was signed as Business Loop 10, SR 84 and SR 93 in the 1960s. It is now marked as the southern leg on SR 77, the new designation for US 80/US 89 north out of Tucson. The Business Loop designation was dropped in 1998. The present-day I‚Äë10 alignment along the Santa Cruz River was laid out after a city bond issue passed in 1948 to build a riverbank-side boulevard with room for a four-lane freeway in the median to follow. The route was originally called the Tucson Limited Access Highway and the Tucson Freeway. Construction on the bypass began on December 27, 1950. The first section of bypass artery, from Congress Street north to Miracle Mile West, was opened on December 20, 1951 but had no overpasses or interchanges at Grant Road (then DeMoss-Petrie Road), Speedway Boulevard or St. Mary's Road. It was first signed SR 84A. The remainder of the route was finished by 1956 to a new cloverleaf interchange at Sixth Avenue (then US 80 and US 89). In 1958, the state added the bypass to the Interstate Highway System as part of I-10 and began converting it to full freeway standards. The freeway was finally completed in 1961, and parts of it obliterated the original road. The SR 84A designation was entirely concurrent with I-10 between Sixth Avenue and Miracle Mile until October 11, 1963, when the designation was finally retired in favor of I-10. The old cloverleaf at Sixth Avenue was the first built in Arizona, opening in the early 1950s as a southern Tucson gateway junction to the roads linking Tucson, Benson, Nogales and the hoped-for Tucson bypass along the Santa Cruz River. It was converted to a diamond interchange by 1964 and the old \\"quick dip\\" underpass was removed and replaced by an interstate-standard overpass in the late 1980s. Although the controversial I‚Äë10 route across Phoenix was the last gap of I‚Äë10 to be completed, two pieces of the interstate were subsequently left sitting on divided remnants of old US 80 and were neither built to interstate nor modern safety standards. One was the old Sixth Avenue interchange, and a small section of freeway east to the overpass over the old Southern Pacific (now Union Pacific) spur to Nogales and Guaymas. That section was replaced about 1990. The last section of old US 80 that carried the I‚Äë10 traffic was an underpass beneath the Union Pacific mainline east of Tucson, where the freeway median shrank to a guardrail at Marsh Station Road and the Pantano railroad overpass was too low. This underpass and section of former US 80 was originally constructed between 1952 and 1955 to replace the older more dangerous route over the 1921 Ci√©nega Bridge. The Marsh Station Road interchange was replaced in 2011, with the railroad mainline rerouted in 2012 and the railroad overpass removed in 2013. The remainder of the old US 80 section was rebuilt to interstate standards, with completion in 2014. East of Tucson, I‚Äë10 parallels and in some cases overlies old US 80 to Benson, and was originally co-signed as US 80 and SR 86\\\\. The section of I-10 from Valencia Road to Rita Road was the first construction project in the state of Arizona funded by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Construction began in 1957 and was completed in 1960. From Benson, the Interstate follows the Southern Pacific mainline east through Willcox and Bowie to New Mexico, rather than bend south to the Mexican border along old US 80 (signed as SR 80 after 1989), through Douglas. The road from Benson east through Willcox was designated SR 86 in about 1935, that route number was subsequently shifted west and exists now between Why and Tucson. The bypass around Benson was opened about 1979, and other than the Phoenix gap was the last section of I‚Äë10 to be opened. Future The Arizona Department of Transportation in 2008 conducted a feasibility study of building new bypass freeways around Phoenix and Tucson and \\"straighten\\" I‚Äë10 across the state. One route would have gone roughly from Buckeye east to Florence, then east through mountainous terrain to the Sulphur Springs Valley and connect with the existing I‚Äë10 near Bowie. But this new roadway would traverse some environmentally fragile areas and was opposed as a gateway to urban sprawl. Another studied alignment would bypass Tucson to the south, forming a looping bypass freeway from Marana through the Avra Valley to Green Valley to Benson, an alternative that is still being studied.

His crimes were carried out via the internet, where he was known by several pseudonyms based on variations of Irhabi 007; \\"Irhabi\\" being the Arabic word for \\"terrorist\\", and \\"007\\" a reference to the fictional British secret agent, James Bond. Tsouli's activities included setting up web sites and web forums in support of Al-Qaeda and distributing video material filmed by the Iraqi insurgency. His primary co-conspirators were Waseem Mughal and Tariq Al-Daour. Their activities were funded by Al-Daour, who was found to be in possession of 37,000 credit card details, which were linked to more than ‚Ç¨2.5 million worth of fraudulent transactions. Tsouli has been called the \\"world's most wanted cyber-jihadist\\", and his conviction was the first under British law for incitement to commit an act of terrorism through the internet.  Activities from 2003‚Äì2005  Tsouli first appeared on web forums in 2003. He attracted the attention of Aaron Weisburd on a forum called \\"Islamic Terrorists\\", where he initially appeared to be a harmless agitator, \\"At first I started publishing bits and pieces of what he was doing online for comic relief, and really had no appreciation of where he was headed\\". Tsouli and Weisburd taunted each other online \\"I would give him a message like, 'Your days are numbered ‚Äì you‚Äôre going to get caught'. He, on the other hand, was participating in discussions about which part of my body they wanted when I was killed, and he said he wanted one of my fingers as a souvenir\\". In 2004, Weisburd geolocated Tsouli to Ealing in West London, and passed this information on to the authorities. In early 2004, Tsouli joined two now defunct password-protected forums sympathetic to al-Qaeda in Iraq, Muntada al- Ansar al-Islami (Islam Supporters Forum) and al-Ekhlas (Sincerity). There, he gained a reputation as a resident expert on Internet technologies, especially on matters on both enhancing and defeating on-line security. He was well known as someone who could break into a web site and hide files containing al-Qaeda propaganda on these sites (examples of such propaganda include the Abu Musab al-Zarqawi produced film All Is for Allah's Religion, the al-Qaeda Internet magazine Voice of Jihad (Sawt al Jihad), and videos of the beheading of Americans Nick Berg, Jack Hensley and Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.). He would then post links to these covert files on the forums he belonged to. He also mentored other volunteers on the art of computer cracking, both by answering questions on-line and through an al-Ekhlas posting entitled \\"Seminar on Hacking Websites\\". Eventually, Tsouli started posting non-computer related instructional material on-line, including tutorials on making suicide bomb vests and other explosive devices. He also started distributing cracked versions of computer software, including Arabic language translation software. On 5 June 2005, Tsouli wrote \\"I am still the terrorist 007, one of the most wanted terrorists on the internet. I have the Feds and the CIA, both would love to catch me, I have MI6 on my back\\". Following the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Tsouli wrote: \\"Brother, I am very happy.

Following this, 18-year-old Swedish citizen Mirsad Bekta≈°eviƒá, who was one of those responsible for the declaration, travelled to Bosnia where he and Abdulkadir Cesur filmed a video in which they wore ski masks, and, surrounded by weapons and explosives, said that they intended to attack sites in Europe to punish nations with forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. On 17 October 2005 Bekta≈°eviƒá was arrested in Sarajevo, and analysis of his laptop identified Tsouli in his buddy list and his mobile phone records showed that he had recently called Tsouli. The Metropolitan Police were informed, and on 21 October 2005, Tsouli was arrested in a raid on a house in Shepherds Bush, London. He was charged under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 for \\"conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to cause an explosion, conspiracy to obtain money by deception, fundraising and possession of articles for terrorist purposes\\". The trial began in May 2007. Judge Peter Openshaw caused some controversy when he halted the trial to ask what a web site was, saying \\"The trouble is I don‚Äôt understand the language. I don‚Äôt really understand what a website is.\\" Following this, Professor Tony Sammes was called upon to give a presentation which explained what the internet is, how people can access the internet, and what web sites are. At the trial, Tsouli's technical skills were emphasised. Evan Kohlmann testified, \\"007 came at this with a Western perspective. He had a flair for marketing, and he had the technical knowledge and skills to be able to place this stuff in areas on the net where it wouldn‚Äôt be easily erased, where lots of people could download it, view it and save it.\\" On 4 July 2007, after two months at trial, Tsouli and his co-defendants Waseem Mughal and Tariq Al-Daour pleaded guilty to \\"inciting another person to commit an act of terrorism wholly or partly outside the UK which would, if committed in England and Wales, constitute murder\\" (a crime introduced in the s 59 Terrorism Act 2000) and admitted to conspiring together and with others to defraud banks, credit card companies and charge card companies. Tsouli was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, Mughal to 7¬Ω years, and Al-Daour to 6¬Ω years. On 18 December 2007, at the Court of Criminal Appeal, the sentences of all three men were increased ‚Äì Tsouli's sentence was increased to 16 years, Mughal to 12 years and Al Daour 12 years. At the time of their conviction, Tsouli was 23 years old, Mughal was 24 years old, and al-Daour was 21 years old.

There he is reported to have chastised his family about their lifestyle, then after setting fire to the family's home in Rabat, he climbed across rooftops to the apartment building that housed the Consul General of the UK and threatened to kill himself with a knife. According to media reports, it took nearly 13 hours for the police with the assistance of a psychiatrist to persuade Tsouli to surrender. After initially being arrested he was later released by the Moroccan authorities, who complained to the UK government that they had not been informed of the danger Tsouli posed.'Moroccan Alleged Terrorist Claims Abuses during Detention in GB' - North Africa Post 23/05/2015: http://northafricapost.com/7713-moroccan-alleged-terrorist-claims-abuses- during-detention-in-gb.html References Sources *Gabriel Weimann, Terror on the Internet: The New Arena, (2006) The New Challenges.

Originally formed as an independent record label, it established itself as an important Ottawa studio when it landed the contract for public service announcement for Child & Youth Friendly Ottawa, a youth advocacy group. The announcement was subsequently run on CJOH-TV, the capital's affiliate of Canada's largest private broadcaster, CTV, giving the studio substantial exposure. The founder of Skycron, Cory Carlick, was just 16 when the company was formed. The company got its start when Carlick's music was accidentally discovered on the Internet by an Ottawa broadcaster, who liked the work. The company has subsequently produced numerous spots in English and French for broadcasters and clients across North America and Europe, as well as original programming for syndication. Notable projects include the official music video, \\"La t√™te en l'air\\" for Quebec supergroup Kain; GO/NITRO, a sports series produced for Bell Media (parent of Canadian broadcasters CTV and TSN). In December 2019, GO/NITRO began running in syndication in the United States. WBBJ-TV, a CBS and ABC affiliate in Jackson, Tennessee, was the first American station to run the series, quickly followed by stations in South Dakota and New York state. SKYCRON owns a syndication division that handles advertising and placement of its programs, and has programming agreements with numerous major US broadcasting media holdings, including Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group. It also produces content for major sports organizations, including the Saskatchewan Rattlers of the CEBL.

Background Florence was the fourth child and second daughter of Charles McLaren, 1st Baron Aberconway and Laura Elizabeth Pochin. Her brothers were the Liberal politicians Henry D McLaren and Francis McLaren. In 1907 she married, as his second wife, Sir Henry Norman, 1st Baronet, a noted journalist and then Liberal MP for Wolverhampton South, who lost this seat in the first election of 1910 but then gained Blackburn in the second election of that year. Amongst the causes Sir Henry helped promote as a politician was women's suffrage of which Lady Norman was herself an active supporter of women's suffrage but not a militant. She held the post of Hon. Treasurer of the Liberal Women's Suffrage Union. Like her grandparents who started Bodnant Gardens, Florence was a keen horticulturist. When she and her husband acquired Ramster Hall, Surrey she was instrumental in setting out rhododendrons and azaleas in the gardens. The gardens were opened to public view under the National Gardens Scheme from 1927 and continue to be opened under that scheme. Politics Like her mother, she was active in the cause of women's suffrage through the Liberal Women's Suffrage Union and the Women's Liberal Federation. During the First World War, she ran a voluntary hospital in Wimereux, France with her husband. She was awarded the Mons Star for her services and created a CBE for her war services. After the creation of the Imperial War Museum in 1917 she became chair of one of its subcommittees and was instrumental in ensuring that the contributions of women during the war were recorded and included in the museum's collections. Having an interest in mental health issues, she became the first woman to be appointed to the board of the Royal Earlswood Hospital in 1926. During the Second World War she was a driver for the Women's Voluntary Service in London. The archives of Lady Norman are held at the Women's Library in London.

Varner grew up in Millburn New Jersey, and studied piano in his youth with Capitola Dickerson of Summit, New Jersey. He holds a B.M. degree (1979) from the New England Conservatory of Music, where he studied jazz improvisation and composition with Ran Blake, George Russell, and Jaki Byard, and horn with Thomas Newell. He also studied briefly in 1976 with jazz horn pioneer Julius Watkins. Varner also holds an M.A. (2005) from the City College of New York, where he studied with Jim McNeely, Scott Reeves, and John Patitucci. Biography He has performed and recorded with Steve Lacy, Dave Liebman, George Gruntz, John Zorn, Bobby Watson, La Monte Young, Miles Davis with Quincy Jones, Bobby Previte, Jim McNeely, McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman, the Mingus Orchestra, Franz Koglmann, and appears on more than 70 albums. He also has 13 albums out as a composer/leader, with sidemen such as Steve Wilson, Tony Malaby, Ed Jackson, Ellery Eskelin, Tom Rainey, Cameron Brown, Drew Gress, Matt Wilson, Kenny Barron, Victor Lewis, Fred Hopkins, and Billy Hart. Varner has been in the Down Beat Critics Poll Top Ten annually since the mid-1990s. He has been awarded grants from the Jack Straw Foundation, Seattle's 4Culture, National Endowment for the Arts, the Chamber Music America/Doris Duke Foundation, and has been a resident at the MacDowell, Blue Mountain Center, and Centrum arts colonies. Varner's first two recordings as a leader were influenced by Ornette Coleman, Steve Lacy, Charles Mingus, Anthony Braxton, and minimalists such as Steve Reich and Philip Glass, and featured Varner's horn with alto sax (Ed Jackson), bass (Fred Hopkins or Ed Schuller) and drums (Billy Hart), with no chordal instrument. His third recording was a more \\"straight-ahead\\" jazz project, with Kenny Barron, Jim Snidero, Mike Richmond, and Victor Lewis. The fourth project was a Sonny Rollins-influenced trio of horn, bass (Mike Richmond) and drums (Bobby Previte). From that point (1987) on, most of Varner's work as a leader was for a quintet of horn and two saxes, bass, and drums, with frequent guest artists augmenting the ensembles. Varner has combined contemporary chamber music with jazz and free improvisation in almost all of his subsequent projects. His recent work (finished in 2008, released 2009), Heaven and Hell, is for a tentet of three brass, five reeds, and bass and drums. His newest CD, Nine Surprises, is for a nonet of three brass, four reeds, and bass and drums, and was released in Fall 2014. It features Seattle players Mark Taylor, Steve Treseler, Eric Barber, Jim DeJoie, Thomas Marriott, David Marriott, Phil Sparks, and Byron Vannoy. Varner lived in New York City from 1979 to 2005, and now lives in Seattle. He is now Associate Professor of Music at Cornish College of the Arts.

Between 1898 and 1900, along with R.A.S. Macalister, Bliss excavated several sites in the Shephelah region of modern Israel, helping to improve the chronology of the region. His excavation reports appeared frequently in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and included the first jar handle stamped by one of the Hebron LMLK seals (in 1899 simultaneously the first one with a 4-winged icon) as well as the first complete MMST inscription (in 1900). He was dismissed as the head of the Fund in 1900 due to his ill health. After the publication of his and Macalister's Excavations in Palestine in 1902, he was not active in the field.

The plant can reach up to 80 cm, It typically flowers in May and June, but not always. The greyish-green leaves emerge in autumn, they grow between 20‚Äì70 cm tall. The leaves die after the flowers fade.Scott Ogden and Lauren Springer Ogden The Spanish iris is favoured by florists for its striking colour combinations. This species has several varieties popular in horticulture, among them var. lusitanica whose flowers are yellow all over. It is among the hardier bulbous irises, and can be grown in northern Europe. But not in North America. Where the frosts would damage the autumn foliage.

Enrollment totaled 1,018 students in fall of 2014: 735 undergraduates, 243 graduate, and 40 non-degree seeking students. It offers more than 30 undergraduate and seven graduate degree programs.  History  Catherine McAuley, founder of the Sisters of Mercy and an early 18th-century Irishwoman, had a bold vision. She believed that nothing was more productive of good to society than the careful education of women. Mother Mary Leo Gallagher, another Sister of Mercy, carried on the tradition and opened the doors of College of Saint Mary in 1923. In the old Continental Hotel at 15th and Castelar Streets, the work began. The church schools needed teachers. To be effective in these positions, Mother Gallagher believed women needed a strong liberal arts education. Mother Gallagher accomplished this feat when women had won the vote just three years prior. In November 1950, the sisters purchased of land for $150,000 next to a dirt road named 72nd Street and what would become Mercy Road. A $3 million construction project began in March 1953 and by May 1955, College of Saint Mary was a reality. That year, 255 students enrolled and by 1958 College of Saint Mary had become a four-year fully accredited college.

It includes two separate segments, respectively named Autoroute Charest and Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency. Originally meant to be connected and form a single continuous highway via a tunnel under the city centre (unused ramps were torn down at the western terminus of the Dufferin-Montmorency section in the late 2000s), these plans were shelved years ago and are not expected to be revived. The designation of Autoroute Charest is likely derived from Boulevard Charest, which is the street continuation east of this segment of A-440. Route description The Autoroute Charest segment is long. It begins at the junction of A-73 and A-40 and ends at Saint-Sacrement Avenue. Originally built as a two-lane freeway in 1962, it was twinned in 1967. The roadway continues as Boulevard Charest into downtown Quebec, where A-440 traffic is directed along Rue Monseigneur-Gauvreau to reach the Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency at its westernmost interchange (exit 21). West end of Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency The Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency is long. It begins at Route 175 (Corner of Avenue Dufferin and C√¥te d'Abraham) and ends at the junction with A-40 in Beauport. The portion from Route 175 to Boulevard Henri-Bourassa. (Exit 23) was built in 1976 and the rest of the segment (Exits 23 to 29) was built in 1982. The autoroute was designated Dufferin-Montmorency because it extends former Avenue Dufferin (now Avenue Honor√©-Mercier) in Quebec City and ends near the Montmorency Falls in Beauport.

Ivory Coast is one of the most pro-American nations in Africa and the world, with 85% viewing the U.S. favorably in 2002, and rising to a high of 88% in 2007.Opinion of the United States Pew Research Center  History  In 1842, the U.S. Navy launched the Ivory Coast expedition, a punitive expedition carried out in response to attacks on U.S. merchant ships by the native Bereby people, residing in what would become the modern-day country of Ivory Coast. Ivory Coast's relationship with the U.S. was cordial, if less intimate than its ties with its former colonizer France. Through the mid-1980s, Ivory Coast was one of Africa's most loyal supporter of the United States in the United Nations General Assembly. It supported the larger United States agenda on Chad, the Western Sahara, South Africa, and Israel. The government strongly approved of moves by the United States against Muammar al- Gaddafi, especially in light of rumors that Libyans in Burkina Faso were recruiting and training agents to infiltrate Ivory Coast. United States Secretary of State George P. Shultz visited Abidjan in 1986 following F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny's visit to Washington, D.C. in 1983. The United States continued to be Ivory Coast's leading trading partner, after France. During the Cold War, foreign policymakers in Washington continued to point to Ivory Coast as an exemplar of successful capitalism, even as Ivory Coast's foreign debt mounted out of control. While enjoying a favorable image in the United States, Houphou√´t-Boigny has indirectly criticized the United States by attacking the system of international trade, which the United States supported unequivocally, but which Houphou√´t-Boigny claimed was responsible for his country's economic ills. Some strain has resulted from the Section 508 restrictions on nonhumanitarian aid imposed on Ivory Coast following the December 1999 coup. Because of Ivorian governmental interference in the 2000 presidential elections, the Section 508 restrictions were not lifted. The U.S. participates in the international effort to assist Ivory Coast in overcoming its current crisis, providing more than a quarter of the funding for the UN peacekeeping mission that helps to maintain the ceasefire. The U.S. has also provided modest economic support fund (ESF) assistance to promote democracy. The U.S. is sympathetic to Ivory Coast's desire for rapid, orderly economic development as well as its moderate stance on international issues. Bilateral U.S. Agency for International Development funding, with the exception of self- help and democracy and human rights funds, has been phased out, although Ivory Coast continues to benefit to a limited extent from regional West African programs. The country remains a major beneficiary of U.S. assistance in combating HIV/AIDS, as it is one of 15 focus countries under the President‚Äôs Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). With assistance under PEPFAR likely to total some $85 million in FY 2007, this is by far the largest U.S. assistance program in Ivory Coast. Ivorian eligibility for the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has been withdrawn, following the political impasse resulting from the 2002 rebellion. The U.S. and Ivory Coast maintain an active cultural exchange program, through which prominent Ivorian Government officials, media representatives, educators, and scholars visit the U.S. to become better acquainted with the American people and to exchange ideas and views with their American colleagues. This cooperative effort is furthered through frequent visits to Ivory Coast by representatives of U.S. business and educational institutions, and by visits of Fulbright-Hays scholars and specialists in various fields. A new U.S. Embassy chancery compound opened in July 2005. A modest security assistance program that provides professional training for Ivorian military officers in the U.S. has been suspended by the Section 508 restrictions.

Marie Genevi√®ve van Goethem (or Goetham or Goeuthen; born 7 June 1865) was a French ballet student and dancer with the Paris Opera Ballet, and the model for Edgar Degas's statue Little Dancer of Fourteen Years (La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans). Early life Marie was the daughter of a laundress and a tailor, who came to Paris in the early 1860s from Belgium. She was born in 1865 in the diverse 9th arrondissement of Paris. Marie's oldest sister, Antoinette, was born in Brussels in 1861. A second older sister, also named Marie, died eighteen days after her birth in 1864. Marie's younger sister, Louise Jos√©phine, born in Paris in 1870, adopted the name of Charlotte and died there in 1945. Her father died at some point between 1870 and 1880, leaving Madame van Goethem to fend for her three daughters on a laundress's income. In 1865, the year Marie was born, the family moved to a stone apartment building on 'Rue Notre-Dame de Lorette' called 'Place Br√©da' near Degas's studio on 'Rue Saint-Georges'. The Br√©da district was one of the city's poorest and most squalid areas for prostitution. In 1880, after frequently changing their place of residence (an indicator of an inability to pay the rent on time) the family settled on 'Rue de Douai' on the lower slopes of Montmartre, a few blocks from Degas's studio, then located on 'Rue Fontaine'. In 1878, Marie and Charlotte were accepted into the dance school of the Paris Op√©ra, where Antoinette was employed as an extra. In 1880 Marie passed the examination admitting her to the corps de ballet of the Paris Opera Ballet and made her debut on the stage in La Korrigane.Kahane, Martine. \\"Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen‚ÄîThe Model\\" (Degas Sculptures: Catalogue Raisonn√© of the Bronzes, International Arts, 2002. 101-07). Marie and Degas Between 1878 and 1881, Degas drew, painted and sculpted Marie in artworks including Dancer with Fan, Dancing Lesson, Dancer Resting, numerous preparatory sketches, and most famously in Little Dancer of Fourteen Years. He frequently attended ballet performances at the Paris Opera and often observed classes at the dance school. By posing for Degas, Marie likely earned five to six francs per four-hour sitting.Kendall, Richard. Degas and the Little Dancer, Yale UP, 1998. 25-44 Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881 When La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans was shown in Paris at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881, it received mixed reviews. Though critics lauded the work as ‚Äúthe only truly modern attempt\\" at sculpture, the majority were shocked by the piece. They compared the dancer to a monkey and an Aztec, and referred to her as a \\"flower of precocious depravity\\" with a face \\"marked by the hateful promise of every vice\\" and \\"bearing the signs of a profoundly heinous character.\\" She looked like a medical specimen, they reported, in part because Degas exhibited the sculpture inside a glass case. Subsequent life In the year following the exhibition of the sculpture, Marie's dance career ended as a result of missing many dance classes.Trachtman, Paul, \\"Degas and His Dancers\\", Smithsonian Magazine. An article in L'Ev√©nement, which preceded the dismissal by two months, reported \\"Miss van Goeuthen‚Äîfifteen years old, has an older sister who is an extra at the Opera and a younger sister in the Opera dance school‚Äîconsequently she frequents the Martyrs Tavern and the Rat Mort.\\" Neither tavern was a desirable place for a young girl. Though no trace of her subsequent life or death has been found, the historical record indicates her older sister, Antoinette, was jailed just prior to Marie's dismissal for stealing 700 francs from a patron at a tavern and her younger sister, Charlotte, became a dancer of some distinction and teacher at the dance school during her fifty-three-year career with the Paris Opera Ballet. In fiction, documentary and the arts Cathy Marie Buchanan's 2013 novel, The Painted Girls, presents a fictionalised account of the life of Marie van Goethem, as does Carolyn Meyer's young adult novel Marie, Dancing and Laurence Anholt's children's picture book Degas and the Little Dancer. A non-fiction work by Camille Laurens, La petite danseuse de quatorze ans (2017), discusses the dancer, the artist, the work, and its reception. The BBC documentary The Private Life of a Masterpiece: Little Dancer Aged Fourteen, produced in 2004, closely examined La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans, the circumstances of Marie's life, and the critical reaction to the sculpture. With Boyd Gaines as Degas, and Rebecca Luker and New York City Ballet principal dancer Tiler Peck as adult and young Marie, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts premiered the Susan Stroman, Lynn Ahrens, and Stephen Flaherty stage musical, Little Dancer, from October 25 to November 30 2014. The 5th Ave Theater in Seattle, Washington, is hosting the premier run of Marie, Dancing Still. It tells the story of Marie from the perspective of an older Marie looking back on her time with Degas.

In Western Christianity, an aspirant is the first stage in becoming a monastic.  Religious use  In Western Christianity, the term is also used in reference to religious vocations as one who is discerning the religious life. This is followed by the novitiate, temporarily professed, and then perpetually professed. In Buddhism, the Four stages of enlightenment are referred to as four aspirant levels in Theravada Buddhism.  Academic use  An aspirant is also a title for doctoral education candidates in German and other European universities. In post-Soviet states, this educational step leads to a scientific degree called kandidat nauk.  Military use   Argentine Military  In the Argentinian Armed Forces, \\"aspirante\\" is a student in any of the five NCOs academies.  Brazilian Military  In the Brazilian Military, \\"Aspirante\\" (officially Aspirante a Oficial) is a rank for a graduate of a Military Academy, either from the Armed Forces or from State Military Police Departments. It is the first rank in the \\"Commissioned Officer\\" career and it is temporary. Normally, \\"Aspirantes\\" hold that title from 6 months to 2 years, depending on the Branch. Aspirantes have the same job as 2nd Lieutenants and are treated as such by their subordinates.  Royal Canadian Navy  Similar to the French usage, the Royal Canadian Navy uses the French-language rank of \\"Aspirant de marine\\" (AspM) to denote a junior officer under training. The same rank in the English language is referred to as \\"Naval Cadet\\" (NCdt). An aspirant de marine does not hold the Queen's commission and must either acquire a university degree or complete his first trades qualification to earn promotion.  Estonian Defence Forces  Junior sergeant conscriptees having passed the Reserve Platoon Commander Course get ranked aspirants, meaning they will be given officer ranks (ensign or junior lieutenant) in case of mobilisation and war. Some aspirants also get promoted during reserve war games.  French Military  Aspirant (:fr:Aspirant) is an officer candidate rank in the Arm√©e de terre (Army), the Arm√©e de l'air (Air Force), the Marine nationale (Navy) and the Gendarmerie nationale. Technically it is not a commissioned rank but it is still treated in all respects as one. Aspirants are either officers in training in military academies or voluntaries, serving as temporary officers. The aspirant must have been previously √©l√®ve officier (Officer Cadet). He can afterwards be commissioned as a sous-lieutenant or enseigne de vaisseau de deuxi√®me classe. His insignia is a single curl of gold lace, disrupted by \\"flashes\\" of wool. It was widely used during both World Wars for providing young educated people with an officer's authority.  German Bundeswehr  Officer aspirant (de. Offizieranw√§rter) designates in the German Bundeswehr a military person or member of the armed forces assigned to an officer¬¥s carrier in Heer, Luftwaffe or Marine.  Portuguese Armed Forces  Aspirante-a-oficial is the first rank in the officer corps, coming below Alferes in the army and air force and Guarda-Marinha (Naval School graduates) or Sub-tenente (temporary officers graduated from civilian universities) in the navy.  Romanian Navy  In the Romanian Navy, aspirant is the lowest commissioned rank, equivalent to the rank of ensign.  Other uses  In Norway, the \\"Aspirant Course\\" is a three- year trainee programme for students intending to work for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, i.e. prospective diplomats.

The ARY Group of companies is a Dubai-based holding company founded by a Pakistani businessman, Haji Abdul Razzak Yaqoob (ARY).  History  ARY Digital, formerly known as the Pakistani Channel, was launched in the United Kingdom in December 2000 to cater to the growing demands of South Asian entertainment in the region. Within a short span of three years, the unique proposition and the content of the channel resulted in massive popularity and in order to enable greater expansion and broadcast into other countries. It uses Samacom, a monopolising uplink provider based in the UAE, as the uplink teleport station. Affiliate Programming Recently ARY Digital has affiliated with several other television networks to promote their content in Pakistan. Amongst these are Fashion TV for which a regional channel FTV Pakistan has been airing since December 2005 on the ARY Digital network. Plans are under way for Al Jazeera Urdu in affiliation with Al Jazeera targeting 110 million Urdu-speaking households worldwide and HBO Pakistan in association with HBO's south-Asian division. With the network's help, Nickelodeon is also planning to kick-start its operations in Nick Pakistan where it would be beamed into 2.5 million households with kids. With so much international diversity under the network's belt, Salman Iqbal, the global CEO and president of ARY Digital network feels confident that the network is bringing international quality to Pakistan's growing market. Specialized Programming By 2004, ARY Digital had ended up three sister ventures apart from the flagship channel ARY Digital, channels targeting generalized programming. They include: ARY News, a 24hr news channel; ARY Musik, a channel aimed at the younger generation featuring the latest from the Pakistani music scene & ARY Qtv, a religious service. With these four channels under its belt, the network viewership grew by folds over the coming years and ARY Digital would often then call itself the premium entertainment provider in the region.  Channel List  ARY Digital Network is composed of the following channels: * ARY Digital - Infotainment for Asia Region *ARY Sports - Official Online Sports Portal * ARY Digital UK - Infotainment for UK Region - No longer available * ARY Family - Infotainment for UK Region * New Vision TV - 24-hour independent news * ARY Digital ME - Infotainment for Middle East Region * ARY Digital USA - Infotainment for USA Region * ARY Zindagi - Infotainment Channel * ARY Films - film distributing company * ARY Musik - 24-hour music * ARY News - 24-hour independent news * ARY Qtv - Quran TV, religious content * Nickelodeon Pakistan * HBO Pakistan * ARY Tube - Official Video Portal of ARY Digital Network  Former Channel Names  *ARY Zauq * The City Channel * ARY One World * ARY Shopping Channel * VH1 Pakistan * Fashion TV Pakistan  Upcoming Channels  ARY Sports ARY Films ARY Films is film distribution company running in Pakistan. It's a part of ARY Digital Network. Thirty five films including 11 Urdu, 6 Punjabi and 17 Pashto films were released by ARY Films in 2013. Among them Waar, Main Hoon Shahid Afridi, Josh, Chambaili, Zinda Bhaag, Siyaah and Lamha top the charts in industry. BOL channel Attempted take over of BOL Network and BOL News happened in August 2015 by ARY Digital Network CEO Salman Iqbal, who said that the decision was taken in view to provide career protection to media industry and its workers.[8] The founder of ARY Group said that his media group would launch the transmission of the channel within three weeks.[9] However this deal fell through and in September 2015 it was announced that ARY was not taking over BOL.[10] Availability Continental programming In 2004, ARY Digital divided its broadcasts in such a way, that each Continent had different programming at different times, to better facilitate the audience. The Channels were split as follows: *ARY Digital Asia *ARY Digital UAE *ARY Family UK *ARY Digital USA ARY Digital Asia This version of the Channel is free-to-air, as channels in the Indian subcontinent are usually free-to-air . Unlike other versions of the Channel, ARY Digital Asia, features a wider variety of Local Programmes mostly dramas and international shows. Many of which may include foreign programmes including Hollywood, Bollywood and Lollywood movies, India, American & British TV shows, for example Criminal Minds, 24, Criminal Minds: Uprising Boundaries, NCIS and Prison Break ARY Family UK ARY Family UK is also free to air. The Programming includes ARY Digital's Dramas and TV shows while also having some programs for ARY Family UK Viewers Only. ARY Digital UAE ARY Digital UAE is also free to air, but the programming is limited to Pakistani programmes only, this includes ARY Digital's exclusive Dramas and TV shows, this is because UAE's local Channels own the rights for American and English shows and Hollywood films. Indian & American programmes are also not broadcast on the UAE version, this is because the Original Indian channels Broadcast the Programmes on thei ARY Media Advisory Board At the turn of events leading to the emergency in December 2007, Salman Iqbal, CEO of the network announced along with the ARY Digital network committee the establishment of a media advisory board, the purpose of which would be to assess the media coverage (be it news or other programmes) on the network. Saying that ARY Digital has been reporting without bias for a while but the recent events ushering the emergency rule and temporary closure of one of the biggest news network Geo TV, ARY Digital required a better unbiased coverage. He concluded that an array of government leaders could weigh the coverage presented by the network on the basis of its rationality and coverage so that the media portrayed by the network was in verse with the way Pakistan is supposed to be imaged. The board would have seats for 20 members, each focusing on different aspects of media would provide their views on how media should be portrayed. Criticism For a brief period in 2003, ARY Digital received criticism upon its airing of a prisoner's derogatory comments against the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC-3) and a video showing balded young girls behind bars begging for mercy. The contempt of court proceedings against the officials of the network were withdrawn after the judge accepted unconditional apologies. Attempted take over of BOL Network and BOL News happened in August 2015 by ARY Digital Network CEO Salman Iqbal, who said that the decision was taken in view to provide career protection to media industry and its workers. The founder of ARY Group said that his media group would launch the transmission of the channel within three weeks.

There are seven subcategories that are recognized as independent diseases. Physical urticaria is known to be painful, itchy and physically unappealing; it can recur for months to years of a person's life.  Signs and symptoms  Urticaria are characterized by dermal edema (wheal, swollen) and erythema (flare, red), also known as hives. Hive lesions typically last less than 24 hours and are usually itchy (pruritic). Hives can appear anywhere on the body and they may change shape, move around, disappear and reappear over short periods of time.  Types of hives  Acute urticaria (short-term): can develop suddenly and will last less than 6 weeks. About 1 in 6 people will have acute hives at one point in their life. Chronic urticaria (long-term): can develop suddenly and will persist more than 6 weeks. This type of urticaria is uncommon and occurs in only 0.1% of the population. 20% of people with chronic urticaria report still having problems 10 years after its onset.  Causes  The cause of physical urticaria is unknown but it has been suggested to be an autoimmune disease. Suggesting that antibodies, which are produced by the immune system to protect humans from foreign microbes, are binding to body tissue; damaging body tissue. In some cases physical urticaria can be a symptom of an underlying health issue such as:Grattan C, Black AK. Urticaria and angioedema. In: Bolognia JL, Jorrizo JL, Rapini RP, editors. Dermatology.

They block the effect of histamine, a compound produced by the body which forms a part of the local immune response consequently causing inflammation. Some research has suggested that the use antihistamines and antagonist in synergy are better for the treatment of physical urticarias.Breathnach SM, Allen R, Ward AM, et al.

Biography Born in T√ºbingen to the scholars Victor Ehrenberg and Eva Dorothea Sommer, Ehrenberg moved with his family to Prague in 1929, and from there to England in February 1939, to escape Nazi persecution of the Jews. Ehrenberg naturalised as a British subject and changed his name by deed poll in June 1947. He was educated at Rydal School in Colwyn Bay, and thereafter at Christ's College, Cambridge, the Regent Street Polytechnic, London, and University College London. It was from the latter institution that he was awarded his PhD, in 1950. He was Professor of Physics at Battersea College of Technology from 1964 until 1970. The College completed its transformation into the University of Surrey (and its relocation from Battersea to Guildford) in 1970. He founded the Institute of Educational Technology in 1967, the first of its kind. He was somewhat of a pioneer and innovator in the professional development of university teachers and became Professor of Higher Education in 1970, a post he held until 1988. The Institute became internationally renowned and his philosophy is one that has been adopted by many universities around the world. In 1994 he was appointed Professor of Higher Education at University College London, where he founded the Higher Education Research and Development Unit (now the Centre for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching). He became an honorary professor there in 2003. He was appointed Visiting Professor of Higher Education at Manchester University in August 2005. He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Physics and a Fellow of the Society for Research into Higher Education. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement award at the 2005 Times Higher Awards, at which Baroness Kennedy said \\"there is a polymath quality to this man that points to someone interested in educating the whole person\\" His brother was the historian Geoffrey Elton and he was the father of Ben Elton, a comedian and author.

The term is usually used in microbiology, especially with regard to bacteria. A GI can code for many functions, can be involved in symbiosis or pathogenesis, and may help an organism's adaptation. Many sub-classes of GIs exist that are based on the function that they confer. For example, a GI associated with pathogenesis is often called a pathogenicity island (PAIs), while GIs that contain many antibiotic resistant genes are referred to as antibiotic resistance islands. The same GI can occur in distantly related species as a result of various types of lateral gene transfer (transformation, conjugation, transduction). This can be determined by base composition analysis, as well as phylogeny estimations.  Computational prediction  Various genomic island predictions programs have been developed. These tools can be broadly grouped into sequence based methods and comparative genomics/phylogeny based methods. Sequence based methods depend on the naturally occurring variation that exists between the genome sequence composition of different species. Genomic regions that show abnormal sequence composition (such as nucleotide bias or codon bias) suggests that these regions may have been horizontally transferred. Two major problems with these methods are that false predictions can occur due to natural variation in the genome (sometimes due to highly expressed genes) and that horizontally transferred DNA will ameliorate (change to the host genome) over time; therefore, limiting predictions to only recently acquired GIs. Comparative genomics based methods try to identify regions that show signs that they have been horizontally transferred using information from several related species. For example, a genomic region that is present in one species, but is not present in several other related species suggests that the region may have been horizontally transferred. The alternative explanations are (i) that the region was present in the common ancestor but has been lost in all the other species being compared, or (ii) that the region was absent in the common ancestor but was acquired through mutation and selection in the species in which it is still found. The argument for multiple deletions of the region would be strengthened if there is evidence from outgroups that the region was present in the common ancestor, or if the phylogeny implies relatively few actual deletion events would be required. The argument for acquisition via mutation would be strengthened if the species with the region is known to have diverged substantially from the other species, or if the region in question is small. The plausibility of either (i) or (ii) would be modified if taxon sampling omitted many extinct species that may have possessed the region, and particularly if extinction was correlated with the presence of the region. One example of a method that integrates several of the most accurate GI prediction methods is IslandViewer.  Examples  In bacteria, many type 3 secretion systems and type 4 secretion systems are located on regions of DNA called genomic islands. These \\"islands\\" are characterised by their large size(>10 Kb), their frequent association with tRNA-encoding genes and a different G+C content compared with the rest of the genome. Many genomic islands are flanked by repeat structures and carry fragments of other mobile elements such as phages and plasmids. Some genomic islands, including those adjacent to integrative and conjugative elements (ICE), can excise themselves spontaneously from the chromosome and can be transferred to other suitable recipients. While excision is dependent on the ICE machinery present, integration is attributed to integrases present on the genomic islands.

Its center is Mandeville Canyon Road, which begins at Sunset Boulevard and extends north towards Mulholland Drive, though it stops short of Mulholland and there is no automotive route between the two. Mandeville Canyon Road is said to be the longest paved, dead end road in Los Angeles, at over . From start to finish, the road gains in elevation. Corner of Mandeville Canyon Road and Sunset Boulevard Mandeville Canyon Road looking North from Westridge Road History Native era Prior to the arrival of Spanish Conquistadors, Mandeville Canyon was occupied by two indigenous peoples, the Chumash and the Gabrieleno-Tongva, who inhabited the Santa Monica Mountains. Spanish era In 1769 Spanish occupation of California began under King Charles III. Shortly thereafter, a group of 60+ monks and soldiers led by Gaspar de Portol√† were dispatched to explore the Los Angeles area. In 1781 the city of Los Angeles was founded. King Charles III gave the city several thousand acres of his land. One of the King's soldiers, Francisco Xavier Sepulveda, made a petition to the King for a grant through the Viceroy of Mexico City. Sepulveda was granted use of the land only; he could use it in the name of the King for as long as he and the King had the arrangement. Mexican era California was ruled by Spain until 1822 when Mexico assumed jurisdiction. In 1839, Francisco Sep√∫lveda, fifth son of Francisco Xavier, was granted a substantial amount of property - of ‚Äúmountains, mesa and shore land‚Äù by the Governor of the Californias, Juan Alvarado. The property was called the Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica (the Ranch of Saint Vicente and Saint Monica). However, Sep√∫lveda also petitioned the government of Mexico for confirmation to the title of his property. Consequently, Sep√∫lveda and his family became the first known non-sovereign owners of the land and inhabited the property for another 33 years. American era Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica included Mandeville Canyon and consisted of all the property above what is now Pico Boulevard out to the ocean, north to the Santa Monica Mountains towards what is now Encino, east along what is now Ventura Boulevard, and south down to Pico Boulevard. In 1872, the Sep√∫lveda family decided to sell their property for $55,000 in gold coin to Colonel Robert S. Baker and his wife Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker, who thought it would make an excellent sheep ranch. The Bakers sold a 3/4 interest in the land in 1874 for $162,000 to silver miner Nevada Senator John P. Jones. Mandeville Canyon at that time was known as Casa Viejo Ca√±on. An 1881 map using this name shows the Casa Viejo Creek running down the middle of the canyon. Records show that the creek carried water year-round, fed by springs in the upper canyon. The name Mandeville Canyon first appeared on a map in the early 1900s as ‚ÄúMandiville Canon.‚Äù The origin of the name is unknown. In 1904, Baker and Jones formed the Santa Monica Land & Water Company and later sold it to Robert C. Gillis. At the time, Mandeville Canyon‚Äôs lush oaks and sycamores and spring-fed creek were reported to be virtually untouched. In 1917, Gillis formed a subsidiary company, the Santa Monica Mountain Park Company, to handle the development of the mountain portion of the land. 1920s In 1920, the American Appraisal Company appraised the value of the in lower Mandeville (from Mandeville Lane to Chalon Road) at $65,000. From Sullivan Canyon (the Canyon immediately west of Mandeville Canyon ) to the San Diego Freeway and from north of Sunset to Mulholland Drive () not including lower Mandeville, the valuation was $253,000. In the early 1920s, the Los Angeles Athletic Club (L.A.A.C.) decided to build a country club community in the Brentwood area. Consequently, the Riviera Country Club was born, as were some of the homes surrounding the golf course. The L.A.A.C. also built three championship polo fields on the site of what is now Paul Revere. Jr. High School. In the ensuing decades, the Beverly Hills Polo Club, a project of oil magnate Russell E. Havenstrite, gathered crowds for matches every Sunday during polo season at the L.A.A.C. fields. Polo players such as C.D. LeBlanc and thoroughbred breeders, including Elizabeth Whitney of Kentucky, bought property in Mandeville and Sullivan Canyon and built houses and stables for their ponies. In 1926, the Santa Monica Mountain Park Company sold the block closest to Sunset on Mandeville to the L.A.A.C as an extension of its Riviera property and sold most of Lower Mandeville, from Mandeville Lane to Chalon Road, to Garden Foundation, Inc. To encourage sales of the newly subdivided land, Garden Foundation designed and built an elaborate botanical garden with plantings from all over the world, many of which are still in evidence. On the slopes surrounding this garden, they hoped to develop and sell homes. Movie stars dedicated many of the special plantings with commemorative plaques (some of which are still in existence). Two ponds were also built, one of which surrounded the Japanese house at 1900 Mandeville Canyon Road. The second pond was adjacent to the property at 1888 Mandeville Canyon Road. 1930s Development of the botanical garden slowed down during the Great Depression, and, by 1935, all building ceased. Bondholders of Garden Foundation, who held the original pre-depression mortgage of $4,000,000 for the entire in Mandeville Canyon, restructured as the Garden Land Company and became the new stockholders. The canyon floor was subsequently subdivided as far as Chalon Road and the first homes were started. Headquarters and sales offices for the Botanic Garden Park was located at 1727 Mandeville Canyon Road. This address later became the home and gardens of the well-known actor Richard Widmark. During the first half of the 1900s, Mandeville Canyon had a reputation as beautiful riding and hiking country, with its spreading oaks, majestic sycamores and new botanic gardens. Many long time Brentwood residents remembered riding horses into the canyons and mountains, often camping overnight near Mulholland Drive, during those years. Also, it was very close to more regimented riding facilities at the L.A.A.C. This reputation was further solidified during the 1932 Olympics as several equestrian events were held in the Canyon, as well as at the L.A.A.C polo fields. In 1938 a major flood hit the Mandeville Canyon area, particularly ravaging the lower Mandeville area. The damage was so extensive that the Garden Land Company remained inactive for the next sixteen years. However, beginning in the early 1940s, centered mostly around horses, Mandeville Canyon started to become a canyon neighborhood with rustic homes for the well-to-do, including at various times the families of Donald Wills Douglas, Sr. of the Douglas Aircraft Company, Robert McClure, owner of the Santa Monica Evening Outlook, composer Meredith Willson, and actors Robert Taylor, Eva Marie Saint, Robert Mitchum, Harry Morgan (Morgan's son Charley states that family moved to Mandeville in 1954 and has remained there to present date), Esther Williams, Dick Powell, Don DeFore and others. Polo players such as Jack Martin Smith and other neighbors would exercise their horses, riding daily across the canyons to play polo at Will Rogers State Historic Park or just down the canyon to the L.A.A.C. 1950s In 1954 Garden Land resumed development and began building homes again. The first large tract included approximately 300 homes built in 1957-1958 in upper Mandeville. At the end of the '50s came other developments known as Westridge and Westridge Terrace on the bulldozed western slopes and hill crests of the canyon. 1960s In 1963 Garden Land relinquished its holdings to Link Builders, Inc. and Seacrest Co. The late 60s brought Swartz-Linkletter developing several hundred more properties in the upper canyon, still single-family dwellings but on smaller filled lots. A plan to develop 3,400 more properties in areas stretching up to Mulholland Drive stopped when the cost of utilities and traffic in the canyon were considered and deemed too great.

He was the third president of the International Sociological Association (1956-1959).  Biography  Friedmann was the last child of Adolphe Friedmann (1857-1922), a Berlin merchant, and Elizabeth Nathan (1871-1940). He was born in Paris, where his parents moved after their marriage in Berlin in 1882. They acquired French nationality in 1903. After a brief period studying industrial chemistry, Friedmann prepared for the philosophy agr√©gation at the prestigious Lyc√©e Henri IV in Paris. He studied philosophy at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure from 1923-1926. He served as an assistant to the sociologist C√©lestin Bougl√© at the Centre de documentation sociale, a social science research center at the ENS funded by the banker Albert Kahn and, later, the Rockefeller Foundation. Upon the death of his father in 1929, Friedmann inherited a fortune of 2.6 million francs, which enabled him to finance several of his young classmates' intellectual journals. Friedmann eventually donated a large part of the fortune to the Fondation Curie for cancer research. After his death, Degas paintings Friedmann had inherited from his father's collection were donated to the Louvre. Friedmann married his first wife, Hania Olszweska, a Polish Catholic, in 1937. The couple had one daughter, Liliane, born in 1941 in Toulouse. After Hania's death in 1957, Friedmann married Marcelle R√©mond in 1960. After taking his family to Toulouse, Friedmann joined the French Resistance during World War II, when he was hunted by the Nazi Gestapo due to his Communist activities. He later wrote that he escaped the Gestapo in 1943, and was hidden in a school in Dordogne by a pair of young schoolteachers.[2] Friedmann's journals from the war, published posthumously in 1987, recounted his experiences as a member of the resistance. He received his Doctorat d'√©tat in 1946, with his major thesis on mechanization in industrial production and minor thesis on Leibniz and Spinoza, both published as monographs.  Scholarly work  At the ENS, Friedmann was close to the Philosophies group that opposed the influence of Henri Bergson and was influential in bringing Marx‚Äôs earlier philosophical texts to France, and included Georges Politzer, Norbert Gutermann, Paul Nizan, and Henri Lefebvre. The group's initial journal, Esprit, and its successor, Philosophies, were funded by Friedmann's personal wealth. During the 1930s, Friedmann made several trips to the Soviet Union, where observed the Soviet industry and technology. His 1938 book, De la Sainte Russie √† l‚ÄôU.R.S.S. established him as an authority on Soviet society in France. But even his moderate criticisms of the U.S.S.R. and Stalin caused bitter conflict with members of the French Communist Party and began Friedmann‚Äôs move away from political activism. Friedmann‚Äôs doctoral thesis, published after the end of the war in 1946, examined the \\"human problems\\" of automation and mechanization European industrial production. A critical, historical overview of paradigms of industrial management, particularly scientific management, industrial psychology, and human relations, Probl√®mes humains du machinisme industriel examined social scientists‚Äô efforts to \\"humanize\\" industrial labor that had been fragmented and de-skilled by industrialization and Taylorism. Friedmann argued that while these efforts were an improvement on the \\"technicist ideology\\" of management engineering, social science would not lead to significant changes in labor practices without class conflict and the transformation of the capitalist economic system. Friedmann‚Äôs book is considered a founding text of French sociologie du travail, and he was influential in the refounding of French sociology after World War II, playing a major role in the foundations of the Centre d'√©tudes sociologues and the Institute des Sciences Sociales du Travail (ISST). His influential students included Alain Touraine, Michel Crozier, Jean-Daniel Reynaud, and Jean-Ren√© Tr√©anton, who conducted some of the first empirical work in industrial sociology in France. Friedmann later founded the Centre d'√©tudes de communications de masse (CECMAS) at the √âcole pratiques des hautes √©tudes, whose early participants included Edgar Morin and Roland Barthes. Friedmann continued to travel extensively around the world, observing and publishing on labor practices and industrial models in the United States, Israel, and South America. His analysis of the nature of the Jewish people and Israeli society in The End of the Jewish People?, one of his few works to be translated into English, attracted media attention in the United States. Friedmann gradually shifted from emphasis on labor to a broader concern with \\"technical civilization.\\" His final book, La Puissance et la Sagesse, a mixture of autobiography and reflection on contemporary society, modified his earlier Marxism and emphasized the importance of interiority and morality on humanizing postwar consumer society.

The hotel is known for the \\"Peabody Ducks\\" that live on the hotel rooftop and make daily treks to the lobby. The Peabody is a member of Historic Hotels of America, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Inside the Peabody in 2006  History  First Peabody Hotel The original Peabody Hotel was built in 1869 at the corner of Main and Monroe Streets by Robert Campbell Brinkley, who named it to honor his friend, the recently deceased George Peabody, for his contributions to the South. The hotel was a huge success, and Brinkley gave it to his daughter Anna Overton Brinkley and her husband Robert B. Snowden as a wedding gift not long after it opened. The hotel had 75 rooms, with private bathrooms, and numerous elegant public rooms. Among its guests were Presidents Andrew Johnson and William McKinley and Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Nathan Bedford Forrest. Jefferson Davis, the former President of the Confederacy, lived there in 1870 when he worked as president of an insurance company.United States Census, 1870, Tennessee, Shelby Co., 4-WD Memphis, Peabody Hotel, Series: M593 Roll: 1562 Page: 147. The hotel closed in 1923 in preparation for a move one block away. The building was demolished and Lowenstein's department store was constructed there. Current Peabody hotel The current Peabody Hotel building, on Union Avenue, is an Italian Renaissance structure designed by noted Chicago architect Walter W. Ahlschlager. Construction began less than a month after the old hotel closed. The new hotel was built on the previous site of the Fransioli Hotel, a structure which looked nearly identical to the original Peabody Hotel. The new hotel opened on September 1, 1925. Before the mid-1960s, alcoholic beverages were sold in Tennessee only as sealed bottles in licensed liquor stores. A patron could bring a bottle acquired elsewhere into the hotel bar, The Creel, where the bartender would tag it and mix drinks from it at the patron's request. The hotel was sold to the Alsonett Hotel Group in 1953. Deeply in debt by the early 1960s, it went bankrupt in 1965 and was sold in a foreclosure auction to Sheraton Hotels. It became the Sheraton- Peabody Hotel. As downtown Memphis decayed in the early 1970s, the hotel suffered financially, and the Sheraton-Peabody closed in December 1973. An Alabama investment group purchased the hotel in 1974 and reopened it briefly under its original name, but they declared bankruptcy on April 1, 1975, and it closed again. Isadore Edwin Hanover purchased the hotel from the county on July 31, 1975, for $400,000 and sold it to his son-in-law, Jack A. Belz, for the same amount. Belz spent the next several years and $25 million renovating the landmark structure. The grand reopening in 1981 is widely considered a major catalyst for the Memphis downtown area's ongoing revitalization. The Peabody Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Peabody Hotel Group The Peabody Hotel Group (PHG) operated two additional properties under the Peabody name for many years. The Peabody Orlando, near Orlando, Florida, opened in 1986 as the second Peabody Hotel. It was sold on August 28, 2013 and was renamed Hyatt Regency Orlando on October 1, 2013. PHG operated a third hotel in Little Rock, Arkansas from 2002, when they assumed management of the former Excelsior Hotel, which was known as The Peabody Little Rock until 2013, when the property became a Marriott. They also operated properties for a number of years under the Hilton name in Greenville, South Carolina and Little Rock, Arkansas.  Peabody Ducks  The Peabody is probably best known for a custom dating back to the 1930s. The General Manager of the time, Frank Schutt, had just returned from a weekend hunting trip in Arkansas. He and his friends found it amusing to leave three of their live English call ducks in the hotel fountain. The guests loved the idea, and since then, five Mallard ducks (one drake and four hens) have played in the fountain every day. upright In 1940, a bellman by the name of Edward Pembroke volunteered to care for the ducks. Pembroke was given the position of \\"Duckmaster\\" and served in that position until 1991. As a former circus animal trainer, he taught the ducks to march into the hotel lobby, which started the famous Peabody Duck March. Every day at 11:00 a.m., the Peabody Ducks are escorted from their penthouse home, on the Rooftop, to the lobby via elevator. The ducks, accompanied by the King Cotton March by John Philip Sousa, then proceed across a red carpet to the hotel fountain, made of a solid block of Italian travertine marble. The ducks are then ceremoniously led back to their penthouse at 5:00 p.m. Over the years, The Peabody Ducks have gained celebrity status with television appearances (along with their Duckmaster) on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, Sesame Street, sitcom Coach and The Oprah Winfrey Show. They have also appeared in People magazine. Ducks marching to the fountain The position of \\"Duckmaster\\" at the Peabody Memphis is the only such position in the world. Celebrities have also assumed the role of Honorary Duckmaster from time to time, including Zane Lamprey, Paula Deen, Joan Collins, Molly Ringwald, Kevin Bacon, Peter Frampton, Emeril Lagasse, Patrick Swayze, Queen Noor of Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Stephen Fry, Rudolph van Veen, Gayle King, Roy Williams, Bill Pierce, Shannon The Dude, Matt Jones, Drew Franklin and Ryan Lemond, and by Rhett and Link of Good Mythical Morning. The custom of keeping ducks in the lobby fountain may date back even further than the 1930s. A pre-1915 postcard highlights the ducks playing in the fountain, and one source claims the custom goes back to the hotel's opening in 1869.baby doll However, the Peabody itself claims the duck tradition to have started in 1933, as on December 3, 2008, they unveiled a new \\"Duck Palace\\" located on the rooftop, for the 75th anniversary of the duck tradition. The 24 by 12 foot enclosure features granite flooring, ceiling fans, a scale replica of the hotel, a fountain decorated with a pair of bronze ducks, and a large viewing window for guests to see them in their new home. The Duck Palace cost approximately $200,000 to construct.  Design features  The Peabody Hotel's most recognizable features are large red neon \\"The Peabody\\" signs atop the Skyway Ballroom and the central elevator shaft. The top floor, the Skyway and Rooftop, offers views of the surrounding Memphis skyscrapers. The rooftop is often used as a space for bands and other musical acts, especially during the Thursday night \\"Rooftop Parties\\" in the summer months. In the elevators, one must press \\"S\\" to access the top floor. If this floor were numbered, one would press \\"13\\" to reach it, but due to superstitions regarding the number thirteen, management decided to call the top floor \\"the Skyway.\\" Music, Radio, and Television Louis Armstrong and his Orchestra performed at the Peabody Hotel in October of 1931. He notably dedicated the song \\"I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You\\" to the Memphis Police Department as a result of his arrest the night before for sitting next to his manager's white wife on a charter bus. The studios of radio station WREC and later its television spinoff WREC-TV (now WREG) were for many years located in the hotel basement. During the Big Band era, the Skyway was a popular night-spot, and the ballroom was one of only a handful of sites in America from which the CBS radio network would broadcast live weekly programs. Regular headliners included Tommy Dorsey and the Andrews Sisters.

It has unlimited jurisdiction within the territory in civil matters and hears the most serious criminal matters. (NI) s 5 Jurisdiction of Supreme Court. It also has jurisdiction over the Coral Sea Islands Territory. (Cth) s 8 Courts having jurisdiction in the Territory All matters are heard before a single judge, including appeals from the Court of Petty Sessions. In the Australian court hierarchy it is one of eight state and territory Supreme Courts having unlimited jurisdiction in their respective parts of Australia. Appeal lies to the Federal Court of Australia, from which an appeal by special leave can be made to the High Court of Australia. History Prior to 1960 almost all matters were heard by the Chief Magistrate who was also the Administrator. If there was a need for a judge then a person was appointed specifically for that purpose. The first such appointment was Ernest Docker, a judge of the District Court of NSW, who was appointed to hear the trial of Anne Christian who had been charged with infanticide. Before the judge arrived, Thomas Mollett had been charged with the attempted murder of his 18-month-old daughter. In 1908 Hugh Pollock, a Crown Prosecutor from Sydney, was appointed to hear the trial of J F Young for stealing a copper boiler, a relic of HMS Bounty. In 1935 Charles Nobbs sued the Administrator, Charles Pinney, for being wrongly removed as the President of the Executive Council in 1934. William Coyle, a judge of the District Court of NSW, was appointed to hear the case. The first person to have a standing appointment as a judge in Norfolk Island was ACT Supreme Court Judge, William Simpson in 1953. It is unclear whether he ever heard a case in Norfolk Island. Establishment The Court was established by the Norfolk Island Act 1957, Part V The Judicial System. and was the 3rd territory supreme court created after the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory (1911) and the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory (1934). The jurisdiction of the Court was to be provided by ordinance, and an appeal was to the High Court of Australia. The Supreme Court Ordinance 1960 (NI), provided that the Supreme Court has the same jurisdiction in relation to Norfolk Island as the ACT Supreme Court has in relation to the ACT, which in turn has the same original jurisdiction, civil and criminal, as the Supreme Court of New South Wales had in relation to NSW immediately before 1 January 1911. The practice and procedure of the Court was also that of the ACT Supreme Court. It was not until 1960 that the first judge was appointed, Sir Richard Eggleston , who was a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and an additional judge of the ACT Supreme Court. The first reported case was Newbery v R in 1965. Henry Newberry was convicted of failing to be enrolled to vote in Norfolk Island Council elections. He challenged his conviction before the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island, arguing that in 1857 Norfolk Island had a constitution and a legislature such that the Crown could not abolish the legislature nor place Norfolk Island under the authority of Australia. Eggleston J considered the constitutional history of Norfolk Island, concluding that the Australian Waste Lands Act 1855 (Imp), (Imp). authorized any form of government, representative or non-representative, and this included placing Norfolk Island under the authority of Australia.Newbery v R (1965) 7 FLR 34 (25 March 1965), Supreme Court (Norfolk Island), Australia). The first appeal to the High Court from the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island was in Sanders v Sanders, a proceeding under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1966 (Cth).. The Norfolk Island Act 1957, was the subject of minor amendments in 1963, which included that more than one judge could be appointed to the Court.. Changes from 1979 Changes were introduced by the Norfolk Island Act 1979,. which repealed the 1957 Act. The most notable change was that the 1979 Act granted Norfolk Island limited self- government by establishing the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. The \\"Judicial System\\" is dealt with in Part VII of the 1979 Act, in which section 52 provided that although the 1957 Act was repealed, the Court continued in existence as \\"the Superior Court of Record of the Territory\\", Constitution of Supreme Court. for judges to be appointed by the Governor-General, Appointment of Judges. and that other courts and tribunals for the Territory could be established by or under enactment. Establishment of courts and tribunals. One of the changes introduced in 1979 was that the Court could sit outside of Norfolk Island, empowering the Governor-General to make regulations: :: > \\"(a) making provision for and in relation to sittings of the Supreme Court > in a State or in a Territory other than Norfolk Island for the purpose of > hearing and determining a matter, otherwise than in the exercise of its > criminal jurisdiction, if a Judge is satisfied that the hearing of the > matter outside the Territory is not contrary to the interests of > justice...\\"(1)(a). Practice and procedure Under the 1979 Act the jurisdiction, practice and procedure of the Supreme Court shall be as provided under \\"enactment\\", Jurisdiction of Supreme Court. a term which includes any \\"Ordinance continued in force by (the 1979) Act\\".(1) Interpretation. One such ordinance is the Supreme Court Ordinance 1960, now the Supreme Court Act 1960 (NI), which set out that the practice and procedure of the Court was that of the ACT Supreme Court. ;Jurisdiction The Court deals with matters arising under specific Norfolk Island laws such as Probate and Administration of Deceased estates;Administration and Probate Act 2006 (NI) serious indictable offences and crimes;Criminal Law Act 1960 (NI) adopting the NSW Crimes Act of 1900. Bail on serious offences;Bail Act 2005 (NI) s23 Power of Supreme Court to grant bail. and registration of Maintenance Orders made by foreign courts (not Australian Child Support assessments);Maintenance Orders (Facilities for Enforcement) Act 1960 (NI). and exercises federal jurisdiction for those Australian federal laws that are expressed to apply to the Territory of Norfolk Island. Application of Commonwealth Acts. Foreign Judgements may be registered in the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island since the Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) is expressed to apply to all external Territories of Australia (of which Norfolk Island is one). External Territories. In a practical sense its civil and commercial jurisdiction commences at claims that cannot be dealt with by the Court of Petty Sessions for Norfolk Island which deals with small claims and claims under $A10,000. According to section 8 of the Coral Sea Islands Act 1969, \\"the courts of Norfolk Island\\" have jurisdiction \\"in and in relation to\\" the Coral Sea Islands Territory. The Supreme Court thus constitutes the superior court of the Coral Sea Islands. Jurisdiction is unlimited except for matters relating to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. ;Location of Sittings The Supreme Court may, if appropriate, sit in civil cases in New South Wales, Victoria or the ACT as well as in the Territory, but criminal cases must be dealt with in the Territory. Supreme Court may sit in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. An appeal lies from the Supreme Court to a full court of the Federal Court. Appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court of Norfolk Island still relies upon the Supreme Court Act 1960 (Norfolk Island) ‚Äì formerly the Supreme Court Ordinance 1960 ‚Äì and relies for its Rules of Court and Procedure on the Rules of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory until such time as the Norfolk Island Court decides to make any specific Supreme Court Rule on a particular matter or topic.

Previously, he served as the head men's basketball coach at American International College from 1977 to 1979, Bowling Green State University from 1986 to 1997, and George Mason University from 1997 to 2011, where he coached the Patriots to 13 consecutive winning seasons and became a media sensation during the Patriots' improbable run to the Final Four of the 2006 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. Larra√±aga won several national coach of the year awards in 2013 and has won over 600 games as a head coach. Biography Early life and education Growing up in the Bronx, one of six children, Larra√±aga attended Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens,Jeansonne, John (March 31, 2006). \\"Final Four George Mason, For Larranaga, it's the Final Fun\\". Newsday. p. A76. where he starred on the basketball varsity under coach Jack Curran, graduating in 1967. He went on to play basketball at Providence College. He was the basketball team captain as a senior, 1970‚Äì71, leading Providence College to a 20‚Äì8 record and an NIT appearance. He graduated as the school's fifth all-time leading scorer with 1,258 points and was the team's top scorer as a sophomore and junior, being named New England's Division I Sophomore of the Year in 1969. (Larra√±aga's time at Providence was recognized with his induction into the Providence College Hall of Fame in 1991.) He graduated from Providence in 1971 with an economics degree, and was selected in the sixth round of the 1971 NBA draft by the Detroit Pistons. He never sought an NBA career, opting instead to go into coaching. Jim's grandfather was born in Cuba of Basque parents, and was part of the Por Larra√±aga cigar company in that country. He is the father of NBA Assistant Coach Jay Larra√±aga. Coaching career Immediately after graduating from Providence, Larra√±aga took a job as an assistant to Terry Holland at Davidson College, also serving as the freshman team coach. In his five years under Holland, Davidson won three regular-season Southern Conference titles and reached the NIT once, and he also amassed a 47‚Äì12 record as freshman coach. In 1976, he moved to Belgium in order to serve as player- coach for a professional club, but only stayed there for one season. He returned to the U.S. in 1977 for his first head coaching job at American International College, a Division II program which had losing records in the previous five years. In two years at AIC, his teams had a 28‚Äì25 record, including a win against Northeastern University, who was coached by Jim Calhoun at that time. In 1979, he was reunited with his former Davidson mentor Holland, who by now had become the head coach at the University of Virginia. Larra√±aga became an assistant at a program that had begun to emerge as a power in the ACC, arriving at the same time as highly touted freshman Ralph Sampson. In seven seasons at Virginia, Larra√±aga was on the bench for an NIT title in 1980 and NCAA Final Four berths in 1981 and 1984. Bowling Green In 1986, Larra√±aga left Virginia for the head coaching job at Bowling Green State University. In his first season there, the Falcons improved by eight games over the 1985‚Äì86 season, finishing 15‚Äì14. He went on to record a 170‚Äì144 record in 11 years there, and was only the second coach in Bowling Green history to take the Falcons to postseason play in consecutive years (the 1990 and 1991 editions of the NIT). During his tenure at Bowling Green the Falcons defeated the perennial national powers Kentucky, Michigan State (twice), Ohio State, Penn State and Purdue. In his final season at Bowling Green (1996‚Äì97), he led the Falcons to a regular-season co-championship in the Mid-American Conference and another NIT berth, and was also named the conference's Coach of the Year. He is still the second-winningest coach in school history (behind only Hall of Famer Harold Anderson), as well as one of the winningest coaches in the Mid-American Conference. One notable NBA player who played for Larra√±aga was guard Antonio Daniels, who was selected fourth overall in the 1997 draft. George Mason Larra√±aga arrived at George Mason in 1997. His first team only went 9‚Äì18, but signs of improvement were present. In the 1998‚Äì99 season, the Patriots went 19‚Äì11, won the school's first Colonial Athletic Association regular-season title in history, and won the conference tournament to advance to the NCAA tournament. The Patriots would again go to the NCAA tournament in 2001 and two NITs in 2002 and 2004. The 2004 team was notable as Mason's first 20-win team in 14 years, and also won consecutive postseason games for the first time in school history. =2004‚Äì05 season= The 2004‚Äì05 team, with three junior starters but dominated by freshmen and sophomores, went 16‚Äì13. However, these players would prove themselves the following season. =2005‚Äì06: The dream season= The Patriots entered the 2005‚Äì06 season as a strong contender for the CAA title. They entered the conference tournament 22‚Äì6, finishing in a tie for the regular-season title with UNC Wilmington. Near the end of the regular season, they were briefly ranked in the Top 25 in the ESPN/USA Today poll, the school's first ranking ever, and were on the brink of making it to the Associated Press poll. They also narrowly lost to Wake Forest and Mississippi State, and survived a tough match at Wichita State in the ESPN-sponsored BracketBusters event. However, from Mason's perspective, the CAA tournament would not live up to their expectations. The Patriots survived an overtime scare in the quarterfinals from Georgia State, and then lost to Hofstra in the semifinals. During that match, starting guard Tony Skinn hit a Hofstra player below the belt, earning a one-game suspension for his action. Many observers considered Mason to be \\"on the bubble\\" for an NCAA bid; some believed that Skinn's suspension would lead the NCAA Selection Committee to leave Mason out of the field. However, the committee put the Patriots in the field, making them the first at-large team from the CAA in 20 years. Some commentators, notably Billy Packer, criticized Mason's entry in the tournament. The Patriots would enter the tournament as a No. 11 seed in the Washington, D.C. Regional, facing 2005 Final Four participant Michigan State. They pulled a 75‚Äì65 upset, giving Larra√±aga and George Mason their first NCAA tournament victory ever. Next was a matchup against defending national champion North Carolina. Prior to the game, Larra√±aga famously told his players: \\"Their fans think they're supermen. Our fans know we're kryptonite.\\" The Patriots found themselves in a 16‚Äì2 hole, but climbed out of it to win 65‚Äì60 and advance to the regional site at the Verizon Center, about 30 minutes away from their campus. The Patriots next won a rematch with Wichita State, controlling the game throughout and winning 63‚Äì55. That put them in the regional final against 2004 champions and regional top seed Connecticut. The Patriots trailed by as much as 12 during the first half, and by nine early in the second. However, they would storm back to make the game close the rest of the way. Larra√±aga would motivate his team during timeouts by telling his players that the UConn players didn't know what conference George Mason was in. He told them that on this day \\"CAA\\" stood for \\"Connecticut Assassins Association.\\" Mason would win 86‚Äì84 in overtime, becoming only the fourth team not from a BCS AQ conference to make the Final Four in a quarter-century (after UNLV in 1987 and 1991 and Utah in 1998). Their improbable run ended on April 1 in Indianapolis when they lost 73‚Äì58 to eventual national champion Florida in the national semifinals. Larra√±aga received the Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award for his accomplishments during this season. Larra√±aga's overall head coaching record going into the Final Four was 366‚Äì273. =2010‚Äì11: The Revival= The 2010‚Äì2011 season brought great promise for the Patriots. Led by seniors Cam Long and Isiah Tate, the Patriots' campaign started off with mixed emotions as they dropped two games vs NC State and Wofford. From then, the Patriots sparked a seven-game winning streak including a key home win in the 'Battle of the Orange Line' versus George Washington University. The following four games proved to be a test as GMU traveled to the University of Dayton, played at home versus the University of Delaware, and away at both Hofstra University and at Old Dominion University. After the lowly spell of dropping three of those four, the Patriots became red hot as they went undefeated during the regular season winning 16 straight games including a crucial conference game at Virginia Commonwealth University. Heading into the CAA tournament, the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll ranked George Mason as the number 25 team in the country, which was their first national ranking since 2006 when they made the improbable run to the Final Four. Senior Cam Long was voted first team all-conference and Coach Larra√±aga was awarded the coach of the year. GMU would fall from the rankings after a semifinal loss to VCU in the conference tournament. In the 2011 NCAA Tournament, Mason was assigned a No. 8 seed and faced off against No. 9 seed and Big East stalwart Villanova. In a seesaw game, Mason pulled out the victory when Luke Hancock knocked down a late three, and Mike Morrison threw down a last-second breakaway dunk. In the next round, Mason lost to No. 1 overall seed Ohio State. =Other achievements= As of February 2011, Larra√±aga's 271 career wins at Mason makes him the winningest coach in the history of both the school and the CAA. He has won CAA Coach of the Year twice, in 1999 and in 2011. The latter award came after the Patriots reeled off a school-record 15 straight wins to finish the regular season, remaining undefeated at the Patriot Center, setting a school record for regular-season wins (25), and securing the No. 1 seed heading into the CAA tournament. University of Miami On April 22, 2011, Larra√±aga accepted the head coaching position at the University of Miami. In his first season at Miami, he led the team to a 9‚Äì7 record in-conference. It marked the school's first ever winning record in the ACC. In his second season, Larra√±aga led the Hurricanes to arguably their best season since the Rick Barry era. They won the ACC regular-season title (the first time in 11 years, and only the fourth time in 32 years, that a team from North Carolina had not won at least a share of the title). The highlight of the season was an unprecedented 90-63 rout of #1 ranked Duke. That win was Miami's first-ever defeat of a top-ranked team, and the largest margin of defeat for a #1 team ever. On March 17, 2013, Larra√±aga coached the Hurricanes to the ACC tournament title‚Äîthe first tournament title in the program's history ‚Äî with an 87-77 win over North Carolina. On April 4, 2013, Larra√±aga was voted the Associated Press' college basketball coach of the year. A week later, the Hurricanes advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament with their school-record 29th win. The season ended the following weekend with a loss to Marquette. He claimed the Hurricanes had not enough energy to win the game because of Reggie Johnson's injury and Shane Larkin's sickness. Academic activities In August 2007, Larra√±aga was appointed as an associate professor in the GMU School of Management (SOM), specifically in the school's Executive MBA program. Although his basketball schedule only allowed him to teach part-time, he was a frequent presenter in classes on leadership, management, and team development, and also often spoke at SOM- sponsored seminars. He had been a guest lecturer in the SOM since arriving at Mason in 1997.

It is located south of Sunset Boulevard and west of the San Diego Freeway (405). The streets are grouped alphabetically, with the beginning of the alphabet at its eastern end. History In the early 1920s four Ratteree Brothers-Judge Earnest Ratteree, Dr. Ira Ratteree, James Ratteree and Allan Ratteree-bought a walnut grove now known as Brentwood Glen. They came from the south, spending most of their time in Arkansas and South Carolina before arriving in Los Angeles. The Ratterees divided their land into five parcels, referred to as the Ratteree Tract, and filed for subdivision in the mid-1920s. They named all the streets as they stand today, but they did not market the property until after the onset of the Great Depression. The streets and sidewalks were poured in 1927. In 1932, the first house was built at 11344 Albata Street. It is still the original structure. The majority of the houses were constructed between 1935 and 1942. One of the original Pepper Trees was still in front of 11346 Montana Ave up until its removal in 2011. In 1954, the city of Los Angeles began construction of three overpasses of Interstate 405 on Ohio Avenue, Sunset Boulevard, and Casiano, now Getty Center Drive. In 1960, the freeway was completed all the way through the Sepulveda Pass. The Homeowners' Association was formed in 1969m at which time residents decided to rename the neighborhood Brentwood Glen. The southbound on-ramp and sound wall were created in 1975 and 1976. After a bus accident in 1994, the Waterford off-ramp was closed. The on-ramp was later closed as well. Today, Brentwood Glen is home to 560 dwellings consisting mostly of single family homes, with some duplexes, triplexes, and multiple-unit apartments. Education Brentwood Glen is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District. Zoned schools include Kenter Canyon Charter Elementary School, Paul Revere Charter Middle School, and Palisades Charter High School.

An exact definition of the condition does not exist. Individuals who are typically labeled as having RAD generally have a history of wheezing, coughing, dyspnea, and production of sputum that may or may not be caused by asthma. Symptoms may also include, but are not limited to, coughing, shortness of breath, excess mucus in the bronchial tube, swollen mucous membrane in the bronchial tube, and/or hypersensitive bronchial tubes. Physicians most commonly label patients with RAD when they are hesitant about formally diagnosing a patient with asthma, which is most prevalent in the pediatric setting. While some physicians may use RAD and asthma synonymously, there is controversy over this usage. More generally, there is controversy over the use of RAD as a label in the healthcare setting, largely due to the ambiguous definition that the term has. Since RAD is not recognized as a real clinical diagnosis, its meaning is highly inconsistent and may cause confusion and misdiagnosis within the medical community. There are also concerns with overtreatment and undertreatment with RAD amongst physicians, since there is little formality with the label. Other problems that healthcare workers have with the use of the RAD label include its exclusion in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, which can lead to billing issues in hospitals and other health care facilities, and the creation of a fabricated sense of security when using it has a diagnosis. RAD can be confused with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, an asthma-like disorder that results from high exposure to vapors, fumes, and/or smoke. Unlike RAD, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome is recognized by multiple societies as a real clinical syndrome, including the American Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians.  Terminology It is common to see RAD incorrectly used as a synonym for asthma The term reactive airway disease originally began to appear in medical literature in the 1980s in reference to asthmatic patients with hyperactive airways, which is a common feature of asthma. This feature is characterized by increased bronchoconstriction reactions in response to stimuli that should not elicit so strong of response. These stimuli can include methacholine, histamine, and distilled water. However, while this was how the term initially was introduced, RAD soon began to be used interchangeably with the term asthma itself, which has led to the current controversy over its place in medical diagnoses. More commonly, RAD is now mostly used by physicians when they are hesitant to diagnose a patient with asthma. This is most prominent in pediatric settings for a variety of reasons. While infants tend to wheeze more often than adults, only one third of them eventually go on to actually have asthma. Asthma and viral bronchiolitis can also be nearly identical to each other when presented in very young children, since they both consist of wheezing, coughing, and nasal congestion. In addition, typical tests used to accurately diagnose children with asthma, such as the bronchial challenge test, are not considered to be accurate for children under the age of five. This can be due to failure of very young children to cooperate. Diagnosing a child with asthma also carries a certain negative connotation, causing hesitancy from some physicians to do so. All of these factors lead physicians to label young children with RAD instead of asthma, since the disease is often only suspected and unable to be confirmed with pediatric patients. Physicians will generally label an adult with RAD if they have no prior diagnosis or history of asthma while exhibiting symptoms of wheezing, production of sputum, and/or the use of an inhaler. Symptoms may also include, but are not limited to, coughing, shortness of breath, excess mucus in the bronchial tube, swollen mucous membrane in the bronchial tube, and/or hypersensitive bronchial tubes. In order to make a formal asthma diagnosis in adult patients, there is requirement to have documentation of either airway hyperreactivity or some sort of reversible airway obstruction. If none of these symptoms are present in an adult patients' medical history or documentation, the physician may label the patient with RAD instead of asthma in order to still indicate there is an airway issue without formal diagnosis.  Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome While the acronyms are similar, reactive airway disease (RAD) and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) are not the same. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome was first identified by Stuart M. Brooks and colleagues in 1985 as an asthma-like syndrome developing after a single exposure to high levels of an irritating vapor, fume, or smoke. It can manifest in adults with exposure to high levels of chlorine, ammonia, acetic acid, or sulphur dioxide, creating symptoms like asthma. These symptoms can vary from mild to fatal and can even create long-term airway damage, depending on the amount of exposure and the concentration of chlorine. Patients that have been diagnosed with RADS will likely have methacholine airway hyperreactivity, yet other tests that also measure pulmonary functions may appear normal. Some experts classify RADS as occupational asthma. Those with exposure to highly irritating substances should receive treatment to mitigate harmful effects. Treatment for RADS is similar to treatment for other disorders that result from acute inhalation. Preexisting allergies can be a risk factor for developing RADS. The main difference between RAD and RADS is that RADS can occur after just one exposure to the inhalants and without any prior sensitization. In addition, although the symptoms of RADS are very similar to those of asthma, they may be resolved. While some physicians argue that RADS is also not a real clinical syndrome, it is more commonly recognized in legitimate associations than RAD. These associations include the American Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians.  Controversy over use  First page of the 2010 ICD There remains controversy over the use of RAD as an unofficial diagnosis. With its use not only being limited to clinical lexicon, but also transitioning to clinical literature now, more physicians are now increasingly disapproving its use in the healthcare setting. One of the largest problems with the using RAD as a diagnostic label lies in the ambiguity of its meaning, as RAD has no true clinical definition. It is either not listed or redirects to \\"asthma\\" in all major medical journal or website. In addition to that, it is also not recognized in the American Academy of Pediatrics; the American Thoracic Society; or the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. In addition, treatments for asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or pneumonia may not be prescribed under a label of reactive airway disease. In contrast, some physicians also fear overtreatment for RAD, as patients can be prescribed inhaled beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids, which are medications used for asthma. If an individual with RAD doesn't have asthma, there is no evidence these treatments are beneficial. As a result of its ambiguous place in the medical field, the symptoms used to characterize it are often inconsistent and can lead to confusion in a healthcare setting. This is a troubling issue for many physicians, as care can be made more complicated; many patients labeled with RAD do not ultimately have asthma and most RAD patients have never formally had their airway reactivity measured. In addition to the inconsistencies of its labeling, there is also no billing designation for RAD in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or the ICD, which can lead to problems for healthcare facilities. Searches in the ICD, point to content relating to asthma. Some medical professionals argue that using RAD as a diagnosis will only complicate research on asthma in the context of clinical research and epidemiology. There is also dispute that by giving physicians the ability to label a patient with RAD, it gives them a fabricated sense of security that they have made a diagnosis, when no real recognizable diagnosis has been concluded.

Abruzzo is sparsely populated and is very mountainous, but the area has a musical history involving opera, sacred music, and even the town band. The great composer of delicate, 19th-century airs, Francesco Paolo Tosti, dedicated a series of compositions to the area, the romanze abruzzesi. Provinces The region has four provinces, each named for the largest city in‚Äîand capital of‚Äîthe province. They are L'Aquila, Chieti, Pescara, and Teramo. By province, they offer: The presence of Flemish composers and private patrons of the arts in L'Aquila accounts for the fact that as long ago as the early 17th century there was an opera theater in Chieti--the Teatro S. Salvatore. The area is currently very active musically and hosts the Society for Baratelli Concerts, the Alfredo Casella music conservatory, the Aquila Soloists Orchestra, and the Abruzzo Symphonic Association. Both the and the conservatory serve as venues for musical performances. The Marrucini Theater, in Chieti, was built in 1818 and originally named for king Ferdinand of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at the time. It is the oldest opera venue in Abruzzo and retains much of its original configuration. Other noteworthy theaters in the province are the Teatro Fedele Fenaroli and the Diocleziano auditorium, both in the town of Lanciano. The town of Ortona hosts the Center for Musicological Studies, the Abruzzo music library, and the Tosti Archives (named for the composer, born in Ortona). Pescara is the site of the Luisa D'Annunzio music conservatory (named for the mother of author Gabriele D'Annunzio, born in Abruzzo) and also the site of the annual Pescara Jazz Festival, one of the most noteworthy such festivals in Italy. The D'Annuzio Theater, built in 1963, is an important venue, as is the auditorium of the music conservatory. An ex-Bourbon barracks houses the Museum and Library of the Peoples of Abruzzo, an important source for ethnomusicological research. The cathedral of Teramo, named for San Bernardo was historically the site of noteworthy performances of sacred music as well as music in private theaters on the premises of a number of aristocratic villas in the area. Currently, the town has the Teatro Comunale, built in the early 20th century. References *Guide Cultura, i luoghi della musica (2003) ed. Touring Club Italiano.

Some CAGS are connected to an existing doctoral program such as PhD in Organizational Leadership: for example, PhD students receive a CAGS in Leadership Studies after completing their 2 years of doctoral study at Eastern University. Liberal Arts certificates of advanced graduate study are offered by some institutions that offer master's degrees in interdisciplinary liberal arts. These certificate programs are designed to hone critical thinking skills and personal knowledge of a chosen field, in addition to encouraging professional development. They typically require 30 hours of graduate study beyond the master's degree. For some disciplines, this certificate requires a three-year post-bachelor's program equivalent to a Specialist degree. For example, School Psychologists must earn an MA/AC or CAS (Master's degree plus Advanced Certification) or Ed.S degree in order to practice in a school setting or be eligible for national certification. These are all Specialist-level degrees due to a required 1200-hour internship experience and 60+ hours of graduate study. Library and information science CAS programs are intended to allow students to closely focus on a particular sub-area of library and information science after earning a master's degree in the discipline. Some students advance directly to the CAS after finishing their master's degree, others return for a CAS after working in the field. The certificate generally takes one to two years to complete, including a culminating cumulative exam or extensive project.

He was a broadly-based Venetian humanist and prolific author, translator and editor; he is now mostly remembered for his Dialogue on Painting or L'Aretino (1557), and his involvement in artistic controversies of the day. He became a friend of Titian, and often acted as in effect his public relations man. Biography The date of Dolce's birth, long accepted as 1508, has been more likely set in 1510.Claudia Di Filippo Bareggi, Il mestiere di scrivere: Lavoro intellettuale e mercato librario a Venezia nel Cinquecento (Rome: Bulzoni, 1988). Dolce's youth was difficult. His father, a former steward to the public attorneys (castaldo delle procuratorie) for the Republic of Venice, died when the boy was only two.Ronnie H. Terpening, Lodovico Dolce, Renaissance Man of Letters (Toronto, Buffalo, London: University of Toronto Press, 1997), p. 9. For his early studies, he depended on the support of two patrician families: that of the doge Leonardo Loredano (see Dolce's dedication of his Dialogue on Painting) and the Cornaro family, who financed his studies at Padua.Emmanuel Antonio Cicogna, Memoria intorno la vita e gli scritti di Messer Lodovico Dolce letterato veneziano del secolo XVI in Memorie dell'I. R. Istituto veneto di scienze, lettere e arti, 11 (1863‚Äì64). After he completed his studies, Dolce found work in Venice with the press of Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari.Cicogna, p. 93, cited in Terpening, p. 9. For Gabriele Giolito de Ferrari He was one of the most active intellectuals in 16th-century Venice. Claudia Di Filippo Bareggi claims that over the course of thirty-six years Dolce was responsible for 96 editions of his own original work, 202 editions of other writers, and at least 54 translations.Bareggi, p. 58. As a popularizer, he worked to make information available to the non-specialist, those too busy to learn Greek and Latin.Terpening, p. 13. Following a productive life as a scholar and author, Dolce died in January, 1568, and was buried in the church of San Luca in Venice, although in which pavement tomb is unknown.Terpening, p. 24 Works Dolce worked in most of the literary genres available at the time, including epic and lyric poetry, chivalric romance, comedy, tragedy, the prose dialogue, treatises (where he discussed women, ill- married men, memory, the Italian language, gems, painting, and colors), encyclopedic summaries (of Aristotle's philosophy and world history), and historical works on major figures of the 16th century and earlier writers, such as Cicero, Ovid, Dante, and Boccaccio.Nancy Dersofi, Review of Terpening, Lodovico Dolce, Renaissance Man of Letters, in Italica, vol. 75, no. 3 (1998), p. 461. From 1542, when he first went to work for the Giolito, until his death in 1568, he edited 184 texts out of just over 700 titles published by Giolito.Terpening, p. 13. These editions included works by Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, Castiglione, Pietro Bembo, Lodovico Ariosto, Pietro Aretino, Angelo Poliziano, Jacopo Sannazzaro, and Bernardo Tasso.Terpening, pp. 266‚Äì269. And he translated into Italian works of authors such as Homer, Euripides, Catullus, Cicero, Horace, Ovid, Juvenal, the playwright Seneca, and Virgil.Terpening, pp. 262‚Äì266. Writings on art L'Aretino (1557), Dolce's main work on art, was designed as a riposte to Vasari's Lives of the Artists, whose first edition of 1550 did not even include Titian, which Vasari rectified in the second edition of 1568. It takes the form of a dialogue in three parts between Pietro Aretino, representing the Venetian point of view, and the Florentine humanist Giovanni Francesco Fabrini.Hale, pp. 50‚Äì51 Beginning with a discussion of the principles of art, the dialogue moves on to a paragone or comparison between Raphael and Michelangelo, and to discuss a number of other contemporary painters, and then ends with a biography and appreciation of Titian.Roskill, p. 8 A clear hierarchy emerges from the book: of all the artists of his own century, Titian is the greatest, followed by the varied and harmonious Raphael, then the flawed Michelangelo.Blunt, pp. 82‚Äì84 It is uncertain how well he knew Titian at the time he wrote his life, which was the first published biography of the artist. There appear to be too many simple mistakes for the text to have been checked over by its subject.Roskill, p. 37 Dolce is a staunch partisan of the High Renaissance in general, and critical of Mannerism.Blunt, pp. 82‚Äì84 According to Anthony Blunt, the work was probably written in close collaboration with Aretino, who died a year before publication. Aretino's advances to Michelangelo had been rebuffed, and there is harsh criticism of his Last Judgment, repeating those already made by others, but usually couching objections in terms of decorum for such an important location as the Sistine Chapel, rather than morality as such‚Äîunderstandably, given Aretino's own notorious record in his life and works.Blunt, pp. 123‚Äì125 Mark Roskill sees a different picture of the book's prehistory, with Dolce being a member of Aretino's \\"outer circle\\" for some years around 1537‚Äì42, before a slackening of relations; over this period Dolce became familiar with Aretino's strong but unsystematic thinking on art. After the publication of Vasari's Lives in 1550, the Venetian intellectual establishment felt the need for a Venetian counterblast, for which Dolce was probably chosen \\"by someone higher up in the hierarchy of Venetian humanists\\", and also supplied with some material.Roskill, pp. 37‚Äì40, 39 quoted On Aretino's death in 1556, the work also took on another purpose: to serve as a memorial for him. It may have been at this point that the dialogue form was adopted.Roskill, p. 40 Dolce's approach in fact relies considerably on Vasari, who he is likely to have known, as Vasari's stay of 13 months in Venice in 1541‚Äì42 came when Dolce was closest to Aretino, at whose urging Vasari had made the visit. In turn, the added material on Titian in Vasari's 2nd edition of 1568 shows evidence of using L'Aretino (and also evidence of ignoring it), as well as the researches of the Florentine ambassador. The two men may have met in Vasari's brief visit in May 1566.Hale, pp. 641‚Äì642; Roskill, pp. 29‚Äì30, 45‚Äì46, 64‚Äì65 Dolce's book continued to be admired as a treatise on art theory through to the 18th century, but more recently it is his biographical information that has been valued. A dual edition in French and Italian was published in 1735, and there were published translations in Dutch in 1756, German in 1757, and English in 1770.Roskill, pp. 65‚Äì68 Tragedies As a dramatist he wrote numerous tragedies: Giocasta (1549, derived probably from Euripides' The Phoenician Women via the Latin translation of R. Winter), Thieste, Medea, Didone, Ifigenia, Hecuba and Marianna. An English-language adaptation of the first of these, the Jocasta by George Gascoigne and Francis Kinwelmersh, was staged in 1566 at Gray's Inn in London.This production is regarded as the first performance of a ‚ÄòGreek‚Äô drama on the English stage. See . His tragedy Didone (1547) was one of his more influential tragedies in Italy, a precursor of Pietro Metastasio's Didone abbandonata (1724).Terpening, p. 126. Comedies He also wrote numerous comedies, including Il Marito, Il Ragazzo, Il Capitano, La Fabritia, and Il Ruffiano.Terpening, p. 258. Histories Two of his histories‚Äîthe Life of Charles V (1561) and the Life of Ferdinand I (1566) were very successful in the sixteenth century. His History of the World (Giornale delle historie del mondo, 1572, posthumous) is a lengthy calendar of notable historical and literary events, listed for each day of the year. The events he employs range in time from the origins of civilization to his own day.Terpening, p. 132. Treatises His Treatise on Gems (Trattato delle gemme, 1565) falls into the lapidary tradition, with Dolce discussing not only the physical qualities of jewels but the power infused in them by the stars.Terpening, pp. 151‚Äì156. As his authorities, he cites Aristotle, the Persian philosopher Avicenna, Averroes, and the Libri mineralium of Albert the Great among others, but, according to Ronnie H. Terpening, he appears to have simply translated Camillo Leonardo's Speculum lapidum (1502) without crediting the earlier author.Terpening, p. 150. In addition to translating Cicero's De Oratore (1547), Dolce authored several treatises on language, among them the Osservationi nella volgar lingua (1550). This was a linguistic and grammatical study in which Dolce draws examples from and comments on Dante, Boccaccio, and Ariosto, among others.Terpening, p. 25. Chivalric Romances In the genre of chivalric romance, Dolce produced several reworkings of traditional material, including Sacripante (1536), Palmerino (1561), Primaleone, figliuolo di Palmerino (1562), and the posthumous Prime imprese del conte Orlando (The Early Deeds of Count Orlando) (1572).Terpening, p. 30. Classical Epic Drawing heavily on Virgil, he wrote an epic poem on Aeneas, the Enea, published the year of his death. For those who had no knowledge of Greek or Latin, he compiled a work in ottava rima, L'Achille et l'Enea, joining Homer's epic to Virgil's, a work published posthumously in 1570. Editions of Other Writers Among the authors edited by Dolce (for which see \\"Works\\" above), he focused most significantly on Ariosto. He edited three of Ariosto's comedies, La Lena (c. 1530), Il Negromante (c. 1530), and I Suppositi (1551); the poet's Rime (1557), and the Orlando furioso (1535). For the latter poem, he published a work explaining the more difficult aspects, the Espositioni (1542), and an analysis of the poem's figurative language, the Modi affigurati (1554). Translations Whether Dolce knew Greek or not has been questioned by Emmanuel Antonio Cicogna.Memoria intorno la vita e gli scritti di Messer Lodovico Dolce. Nevertheless, using (but not acknowledging) Latin translations of authors such as Euripides, he translated the works of several Greek authors into Italian, among them Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon, 1544), Homer's Odyssey (L'Ulisse, 1573, posthumous) and the History of the Greek Emperors (1569, posthumous) by Nicetas Acominatus.Terpening, p. 262. He also translated various Latin authors, sometimes very loosely, other times, such as for Seneca's ten tragedies, with fidelity to the original.Terpening, p. 93. Ronnie H. Terpening concludes his book on Dolce by noting that > Truly, then as now, taking into account all his imperfections and those of > the age, this is a worthy career for any man or woman of letters. Without > his unstinting efforts, the history and development of Italian literature > would surely be the poorer. In addition, if what others have said about him > is accurate, Dolce was also a good man, for after ‚Äúindefatigable‚Äù the > adjectives used most often to describe him are ‚Äúpacifico‚Äù and, of course, > ‚Äúdolce‚Äù. In such a contentious age, these are simple but high words of > praise indeed.

It is where the city was born and much of its history was created. It was a prosperous area until 1953, when it was devastated by a tornado. The South Side is a largely Hispanic community. It is home to many restaurants and stores. There are six sectors in the South Side. They are: *Alta Vista *Baylor *Brazos *Kendrick *Oakwood *University East Side The East Side, to the north and on the other side of the Brazos River, is a historically African-American side. There are three sectors in the East Side. They are: * Carver * East Riverside * Timbercrest Downtown Downtown Waco is small compared to that of cities like Dallas or Houston. Nevertheless, 17,000 people commute to work there each day. Downtown Waco was built around the Waco Suspension Bridge, which was a crucial crossing of the Brazos River. In May 1953, a tornado struck downtown Waco killing 114, and injuring hundreds. It caused millions of dollars in damage, and negatively impacted Waco's economy for years to come. Downtown Waco is mainly known for the ALICO tower, which was completed in 1910, and was once the tallest structure in the Southwest. Downtown Waco is now the location of the famous Dr Pepper Museum, where Dr Pepper was invented, and the McLennan County Courthouse. In the past few decades, Downtown Waco was slowly decaying as Waco grew to the West, away from Downtown. Recently Waco's city leaders have been working to make Downtown Waco the city center again. There are two projects currently being worked on in Heritage Square, which takes up two blocks in the downtown area. The first project is the new Chamber of Commerce of Waco, which will be an environmentally-friendly building. The second project, which is expected to break ground in the fall of 2007, is a mixed-use development with commercial and residential buildings.

It follows the pattern set by the five previous novels (i.e. Arthur has to deal with the removal of the sixth Trustee of the Architect and her Will, Superior Saturday). Superior Saturday, like many books of the Keys to the Kingdom series, was first released in Australia, being released in early June 2008. The expected release date was 1 July 2008 in the United Kingdom (however people who pre-ordered with Amazon received their copy a day early), and 1 August 2008 for the United States. However Barnes & Noble released it on Monday, 7 July.  Characters  Superior Saturday is the firstborn of the Seven Trustees chosen by the Architect to help Her manage affairs within the House, which is the epicentre of the universe and the first Creation of the Architect. When the Architect disappeared, She left behind a Will, stating what was to happen to the Keys to the Kingdom, and with it, the mastery of each demesne of the House. Saturday was given control of the Upper House and the Sixth Key. Defying the Architect's wish that control of the House be given to a mortal Heir, Saturday kept the Sixth Key and the Upper House, and with the help of Lord Sunday convinced the other Trustees (Mister Monday, Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday, Lady Friday) to retain mastery of their respective Keys and demesnes of the House. She serves directly under Sunday, and often makes rulings on things not under her direct control, using his \\"tacit\\" approval as authority. It has been revealed that she is the oldest Denizen, the most powerful and knowledgeable sorcerer within the House, and the third most ancient being in the universe, after the Architect and the Old One. She decried their collaborative experiment of having children from the beginning and (possibly as a result) resents being inferior to Sunday. For the last 10,000 years she has been hatching a plan to remedy this perceived injustice and rule the House from its highest realm, the Incomparable Gardens. She represents the sin of envy. As shown in all of the novels in the series, Superior Saturday was the one most plotting against Arthur Penhaligon. During Sir Thursday she ordered the creation of the Skinless Boy, an example of a certain type of Nithling called a Spirit-Eater or Cocigrue, whose purpose is to take the place of a mortal within their Secondary Realm. A Cocigrue has the power to control the minds of anyone whom it touches, using the spores of a symbiotic fungoid as a means of doing so. At the end of Drowned Wednesday, it is revealed that she (Saturday) sent this one into Earth to take Arthur's place, preventing his return. Using its symbiont's spores to control the minds of Arthur's family and friends, Saturday was able to hold their memory of him for ransom in exchange for all of his Keys, Demesnes, and any claim as the Rightful Heir. Her next move was to order an invasion of the Middle House during the events in Lady Friday. She proclaims control of the Middle House; but as Friday did not legally abdicate her authority of the Middle House, Saturday's claim was false. It has been confirmed that Saturday possesses the sin of envy when she is taunted by Sunday when he shows her glimpses of his realm. He is aloof and represents pride. It was revealed in Sir Thursday that Saturday controls the Bathroom Attendants; Denizens who \\"wash between the ears\\" of Piper's children, removing their memories. She controls elevators between the various demesnes of the House and also attempts to control the telephones of the House, but as these fall under the authority of the Lower House and the wiring of them under the Far Reaches, she lacks full control. She also (up to the events of Sir Thursday) controlled the Army of the Architect through Thursday. Most of these powers have presumably been granted to her by Sunday. At the end of Lady Friday, Suzy Blue gave Arthur a piece of paper, ripped from a larger piece, that was found by Ugham, and was given up by Ugham before he was destroyed by the Void of Nothing. > \\"For the last time, I do not wish to intervene. Manage affairs in the House > as you wish. > It will make little difference in the end.\\" > S. Dame Primus confirms to Arthur that the note is from Sunday, as Saturday would not have signed it with a single \\"S\\", being too proud.Superior Saturday p75 The Sixth Key is a quill pen and the Sixth Part of the Will is a raven. This part of the Will seems much more charitable than the others, being willing to help Arthur rescue Suzy, but still lacking respect for lower creatures, rather willing to knock out a Denizen for his clothes. It is implied that Arthur has been changed by his use of the Keys into an immortal (though it is uncertain of what type); his blood is now golden rather than red, his eyes are now blue and luminous, and he is taller, stronger, more handsome, and more tolerant of injuries than before.  The Upper House  The Upper House, demesne of Superior Saturday, consists of a single tremendous tower and four immense \\"Drasil Trees\\" (based upon the world supporting World Tree of Norse Mythology, Yggdrasil) which support the Incomparable Gardens above. It is the training center of House Sorcerers and therefore contains the largest concentration in any area of such Denizens. As hinted in previous books, most House Sorcery is worked by means of writing in a medium called \\"Activated Ink\\", which contains the substance known as Nothing. The tower is subject to constant rain, some of which contains the text of the Will until the latter is gathered by Arthur. All Denizens therefore carry umbrellas, which are colored according to rank. Inexplicably, the rain does not touch the various documents on which the Denizens write. The majority of Denizens within the Upper House work at desks situated within large iron cubes having mesh floors and no ceiling. These iron cubes make up the structure of Superior Saturday's tower. A population of Piper's Children (human children brought to the House by the Piper and later appointed to subordinate positions) titled \\"Grease Monkeys\\" work the chains which move the Denizens' \\"offices\\" according to the changes in an occupant's rank. The ceiling of the Upper House is actually the floor of the Incomparable Gardens and is shrouded in clouds. Sunday constantly taunts Saturday by parting the clouds only for her eyes, allowing Saturday to see his realm, which she desires and envies. Saturday, for the past (almost) ten thousand years, has been building a tower with her private viewing chamber at the top while the other floors are \\"slotted in\\" below. The purpose of the tower is to reach and invade the Incomparable Gardens above, so that she may claim it for herself. Within the Upper House are four large trees, located at the four corners of the Upper House, that are constantly growing at a rate faster than Saturday can build her tower. As these trees grow, the Incomparable Gardens move further upwards, irritating Saturday because they grow faster than she builds. Her sorcerers have calculated that if the Lower House and the Far Reaches fall into Nothing, then the four trees would grow at a pace slow enough for her builders to finally reach the Incomparable Gardens. This implies that she (as Dame Primus had suspected) planned deliberately to cause this to happen.  Plot  The book begins with Saturday discussing with her new Dusk (who was younger brother to Saturday's former Dusk) her plan to invade Sunday's realm, the Incomparable Gardens, which she has been trying to reach since the Architect disappeared. Arthur, returning to Earth with Friday's captives, discovers that the national army (under orders from General Pravuil, who is secretly Saturday's servant) is planning to destroy his hometown with nuclear bombs to prevent a disease outbreak, and uses the Fifth Key to stop time so that he can find a way to forestall this disaster. He then discovers that he is now more than 60% contaminated by sorcery, and is therefore irrevocably turning into an immortal Denizen of the House. Seeing no other choice, he returns to the Lower House (leaving his friend Leaf to deal with Lady Fridays' Sleepers) to find it empty and on the verge of being annihilated by Nothing. He barely escapes, but reaches the Deep Coal Cellar, which is partially protected by the sorceries surrounding the Old One's prison. After finding his advisor Dr. Scamandros in the Cellar, Arthur confronts the Old One, who has grown in power and has destroyed his clockwork jailers. He is now surrounded by flowers, which he calls a sign of impending change. After talking to the Old One (receiving no definite answers to his questions), Arthur returns to the Citadel in the Great Maze and plans a pre- emptive strike against Saturday. Arthur hence learns that Saturday (as Dame Primus suspected in Lady Friday) has deliberately destroyed the Lower House and Far Reaches to stunt the growth of the Drasil trees that lift Sunday's realm higher than Saturday can build. She believes that even if the rest of the House is destroyed, the Incomparable Gardens will remain. Dame Primus wishes for Arthur to fortify the rest of the House against the influx of Nothing, but is reluctantly convinced to split herself into two (Dame Quarto and Dame Septum) to administer the House while Arthur seizes the last Keys from Saturday and Sunday. Before she splits, Dame Primus tells Arthur that the Nothing which had destroyed the Far Reaches and Lower House cannot be held off for ever unless the Seventh Key is recovered. Arthur requests Dame Primus to give him the Compleat Atlas of the House, but Dame Primus evasively tells him that she does not have it. He suspects she is lying, but has no idea of her motive. Arthur, accompanied by Suzy Turquoise Blue, who has appointed herself General of a small regiment consisting solely of Piper's Children, infiltrates the Upper House using the Simultaneous Bottles (see quantum entanglement) owned by the Raised Rats. There, they find that Saturday is preparing her assault on the Incomparable Gardens, which are now within reach of her Tower. Finding that the Sixth Part of the Will is dispersed in the rain that constantly falls in the Upper House, Arthur goes to a holding tank for the water to reconstitute the Will (whereupon it assumes the shape of a raven), but is separated from Suzy when they are attacked by Artful Loungers. Flushed down to the lowest levels of the Upper House, he encounters a force of New Nithlings, led by the Piper, preparing to attack the Upper House. Throughout all this, Arthur finds that this part of the Will is more agreeable to him than the first four, though not more so than the fifth, and more humble than any of them. His own metamorphosis is a subject of much attention in preceding chapters, wherein he discusses the changes with himself and Suzy and struggles to control a ferocious arrogance and accompanying impatience that seem to have become part of his personality as a result of his transformation. It is suggested several times that he is not a typical Denizen, on the basis that his blood is golden rather than blue and his eyes, unlike any Denizen's, are luminous. With the Will's help, Arthur disguises himself as a Sorcerous Supernumerary (the lowest-ranked and most terminally depressed sorcerer) in hopes of rescuing Suzy, but is caught up in Saturday's assault force. In the Incomparable Gardens, Arthur tries to take advantage of Saturday's distraction by Sunday's insectile guards to call the Sixth Key to him, but is thrown off the edge of the Gardens by Superior Saturday's spell as he completes the necessary incantation. The outcome is unrevealed. The epilogue shows Leaf trying to get as many people into the hospital's bomb shelter as she can before the bombs are launched. With the help of staff-member Martine, she brings at least fifty-three into safety; but the others are killed as the bombs arrive. As the book concludes, she calls for Arthur to return and set things right.  Trivia  * The Danny Kaye movie referenced at the end of chapter 7 is The Court Jester.

On December 3, 1994, the station became one of the first radio stations in the world to broadcast a live and continuous stream over internet radio. It currently broadcasts at 2600 watts, with a broadcast area covering most of northeast Kansas. The station is overseen by the Kansas Memorial Unions but is completely run by University of Kansas students. The station airs local music, classical music, classic country, jazz, specialty talk shows, world music, variety shows, and airs home football, basketball, and baseball games. History 1950s-1970s KJHK's roots go back to 1952, when KDGU signed on as a carrier current station on 630 AM. In 1956, it changed its calls to KUOK. Wilt Chamberlain hosted his own show on the station during his days as a KU student. By the 1970s, the popularity of the station was outgrowing its limited range and on October 5, 1975 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave final permission to broadcast at 90.7 megahertz, and granted the station the new call letters \\"KJHK\\". On October 15, 1975, Steve Doocy played the first song at 12:25 P.M., broadcasting at 9.9 watts. In 1978 a bored staffer wrote a fake news report claiming a nuclear reactor explosion destroyed Waterloo, Iowa killing 15,000 people. Another staffer found the report and read it on air. The news was picked up by other organizations causing panic and was mentioned that night on the CBS Evening News by Walter Cronkite on how a single radio station \\"blowed up\\" Waterloo. The writer of the story was suspended for one semester before being promoted to news director the next fall. 1980s In 1987, KJHK was granted a power increase to 100 watts. In 1988 the FCC fined the station after an excited DJ said \\"Fuck you Billy Tubbs!\\" multiple times after the KU men's basketball title game against Oklahoma. This led the school administration to remove music with expletives. The administration also prevented Ku Klux Klan members to come on the air for a show on race citing security issues. Angry students protested what they saw as a censoring of free speech with some going as far as to make anonymous death threats. In 1988, responding to pressure to gain a firmer hand on the day-to-day operations of the station in lieu of a gathering storm of controversies (about swearing over the air and because of the KKK incident to appear on air spun by a journalism news staffer), the journalism faculty took possession of the student built and student run music programming of the station that had gained nationwide notice in the alternative media, and a determined group of KJHK staff (current and former) - - - angered about the destruction of their notable legacy (the station was re-branded ‚ÄúJ-Rock 91‚Äù) rose up in anger, and during much of 1988 and the first half of 1989 in a series of protests, benefit concerts, and full page advertisements in the University Daily Kansan telling their side of the story and exposing an overzealous effort to expel the past, successfully forced the journalism faculty to reinstitute the Sound Alternative and the backward K on this pioneering college station's logo and compromised with the faculty in its demand to end the uncontrollable ‚Äúwide open rock-n-roll prairie‚Äù era, of the station, formatting the music programming but mandating that students (not faculty) adopt the alternative formats of their choice. A policy and philosophy that remains in effect today, ensuring the creative progressive legacy that KJHK was founded on and excelled in rather than of the drab commercial sameness found across the rest of the dial. It was a rare victory for student protest anywhere in this world, but not unexpected by rebellious KJHK staff, who were raised on the creative gumption that KJHK. 1990s On December 3, 1994, the station became one of the first in the nation to broadcast a live, 24-hour signal on the internet. In 1995 KJHK changed its tagline from \\"The Sound Alternative\\", which it started using in 1976, to \\"The Hawk\\", because of alternative's association with top 40 music. In 2000, it reverted to \\"The Sound Alternative\\". The station increased its signal to 2600 watts in 1998. 2000s In 2003, after 28 years of supervision, the William Allen White School of Journalism decided that it could no longer support the station's operational budget. However, KU Memorial Unions agreed to take up oversight of the station. KJHK today is funded in-part by the KU Student Senate Media Fee as well as through donations by local businesses and private individuals. In 2005 KJHK celebrated its 30th anniversary by bringing a diverse group of artists to Lawrence such as Mates of State, LCD Soundsystem and Chuck D of Public Enemy. KJHK today The station currently has over 150 student volunteers, and continues with independent music as its charter and format. KJHK has two stipended staffs, Multimedia and Arts & Culture, and seven volunteer staffs. These current staffs are content staff, music staff, live music committee, street team, production, sports, and archive staff. On May 5, 2010, KJHK moved from its longtime home, \\"The Shack\\", to newly constructed studios in the Kansas Union. The studios were renovated in January 2017.

They are educated at the academy for responsibilities onboard surface ships and submarines, in French Naval Aviation, with the fusiliers marins and commandos, and on the general staff. The √âcole navale and its research institute (IRENAV) are in Lanv√©oc-Poulmic, south of the roadstead of Brest.  History  The academy was founded in 1830, by order of King Louis- Philippe. Originally the academy was based on ships, anchored in the harbour of Brest, such as the Borda (previously named Valmy), hence the nickname of \\"Bordache\\" given to the students. In 1914, the √âcole navale was transferred ashore in Brest. The school was destroyed by Allied bombing raids during World War II, and was moved to nearby Lanv√©oc-Poulmic, on the opposite side of the bay of Brest (Rade de Brest). The academy remained in this location after the war, and was officially inaugurated by Charles de Gaulle in 1965.  The successive Borda of the √âcole navale  The √âcole navale, created in 1830, was originally located onboard vessels harboured in Brest, almost all of which were nicknamed Borda (from the name of Jean-Charles de Borda, a famous French scientist of the 18th century). The first vessel to house the √âcole Navale was named Orion; it was then replaced in 1840 by the Commerce-de-Paris, a wooden, three-decked ship. This ship had an inappropriate name for a naval academy, so it was renamed Borda. In 1863, the academy was transferred to the Valmy (the second Borda), then, in 1890, to the Intr√©pide (the third Borda), and in 1913, to the Duguay-Trouin (1879), which had been a school vessel for those applying to the NavyShip Duguay-Trouin was nicknamed (unofficially and symbolically) Borda, fourth of the name between 1900 and 1912. With the exceptions of the Orion and the Duguay-Trouin, each of these vessels was still christened as Borda. In honor of its maritime origins, today's official logo of the Naval School features the Borda with her sails, keeping alive the traditions of its rich past.  √âcole navale traditions on the Borda   The welcoming ceremony  The new cadets are boarded from the pontoon Gueydon, one day before the senior classmen. Crammed like sheep in a gunboat, they were bouncy and happy while launching a goodbye to their families. As soon as arrived, they were sorted, numbered, undressed in order to give them the white blouse and linen trousers. Their hair was also shorn. Two days later, the parents were authorised onboard for the opening mass for the new cadets. Flags were placed around the altar, and a single seat was reserved for the \\"Pope\\", the nickname of the captain commanding the academy. The parents took place on bench, and then the pupils entered, the senior ones first, tiding themselves on the sides, and then the new cadets in their new suit under the quip of the others who were screaming \\"Caillou! Caillou!\\" (Stone! Stone!) to recognize the new cadets. This was followed by the first formal dinner of the new students.  Traditions  A traditional ceremony onboard the Borda was the presentation and delivery of the sword to the son by his \\"baille\\" father, for the first day of outing; the son knelt and kissed the sword's blade as if he were being knighted. In the spring, when the first outing in dinghy occurred, another consecration took place, this of baptism of the new cadets by the senior cadets of the academy, as the latter throw water buckets upon the former.Le Journal du dimanche, no. 248 of 24 August 1913, web: http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5677308w/f13.image.r=Recouvrance.langFR  Slang at \\"La Baille\\"  The √âcole navale is traditionally called \\"La Baille\\" (and not \\"Navale\\", which instead refers to the old school of Health of Bordeaux). Its jargon is rich and comes principally from maritime slang. Like every \\"Grande Ecole\\", the jargon is wide-used among its student body. For example, the commander in second is the \\"widow\\". The elephants, or the \\"p√©kins\\", are the civilians; the \\"bordache\\", or the \\"type-baille\\", is the student. The \\"chafustard\\" is the mechanic; and the mastiffs are the subofficers assuring the military surrounding. Finally, the songs of the board are often crude, but of high musical and literary standard. Nowadays, the student body uses some expressions coming from other military academies (√âcole Polytechnique, Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr, √âcole de l'air) and from military high schools. The standard reference book about the jargon at \\"La Baille\\" was written by Commander Roger Coindeau, and illustrated by Luc-Marie Bayle.  Learning the work of seaman  All this will not impede the future Navy officers to work hard; since the first days, the senior classes accompany the 4th classmen in climbing the shrouds, and make them do the recovery in order to enter in the hune. It is the first step. Then comes the climbing of the second hune, and little by little, everyone gets accustomed not to have dizziness, but to run on the footboard stretched beneath each yardarm, to unfurl the sail. All this is commanded by a whistle. Even if the job of topsman had become unuseful with the modern war boats, it was still taught to the student-officers, in order for them to be able to bring back a catch in time of war with its sails, and also because it was part of the old traditions of the French Navy. The two years of school were well filled up with everything that a Navy officer had to learn: rowing, sailing, the machines, armed drill and weapons instruction, combat training aboard or onshore, signal flags, vessel maintenance, superior mathematics, geography, hydrography, English language, and a lot more. At the 3rd year of studies, the 2nd classmen left the Borda for their training cruises to various parts of the world.  The √âcole navale back to the ground  In the beginning of the 20th century, a project to move the Ecole Naval, to the ground, had almost made its way. The chosen place was at la Pointe, in the district of Recouvrance (Brest). The project failed due to a lack of money. However the school settled in 1915 in buildings already built in Laninon, also situated in Recouvrance, as the First World War was then raging. Work for the campus began November 14, 1929 and was presided by Georges Leygues, minister of the Navy, and the school was inaugurated on 30 May 1936 by Albert Lebrun, President of the Republic. Regardless of the grounding of the school, the final year of formation and training at sea (the School of Application) has been preserved in the form of traditional cruising (sometimes around the world), onboard of successive Jeanne d'Arc ships: the cruisers Jeanne d'Arc (1899), then Jeanne d'Arc (1930) and finally the helicopter carrier Jeanne d'Arc, until 2010. As of today the later \\"Mission Jeanne d'Arc\\" cruises by the cadets have been done in various vessels of the Navy. In 1945, the important destructions suffered by the √âcole navale during the Second World War did not allow it to welcome the student officers in normal conditions. The school was transferred to provisory barracks at the Lanveoc aeronautical base instead, and new buildings were proposed in the late 1950s to accommodate a rising number of naval cadets. The definitive buildings of the new √âcole Navale at its current campus were inaugurated in 1965 by General De Gaulle. The old √âcole navale of Saint- Pierre-Quilbignon is now known as the Naval Instruction Center which hosts the Lyc√©e naval, the √âcole de maistrance and the (currently reopened) Ecole des Mousses.  Officer stream  Engineer degree  The engineer degree is a degree that is awarded following three years of post-high education. Since 2009, l'√âcole navale has adapted it to fully conform with the European education outline. The students are recruited by the exam bank after two or three years of preparatory mathematics classes. The program consists of 6 semesters (or 360 credits, per the ECTS): * Semester 1: maritime and military elementary formation; * Semester 2: scientific common-core syllabus; * Semester 3: scientific options and International relations; * Semester 4: additional scientific study and \\"environment of the French Defense\\"; * Semester 5: end of degree project; * Semester 6: sea application campaign. At the end of this degree, they are given the title of Engineer, and the rank of master in the French Navy. This degree is recognized by the Commission des Titres d'Ing√©nieur, the French accreditation body for engineers. After this training, they go on to study \\"maritime superior warfare and specialisation\\", and they are ranked Enseigne de vaisseau de premi√®re classe, or Ensign first class, equivalent to Lieutenant, j.g. or Sublieutenant.  Under contract officer stream  The officer formation stream is followed by the \\"under contract officers\\". This officer initial formation is given at the √âcole navale. Its target is to give to this young graduate, of the superior education of diversified origins, a maritime, military culture and an engineer formation. It takes one year. It is attested by the attribution for: * the navy officer of the \\"operations lead\\" stream by the certificate of \\"bridge watch leader\\" which is the international certificate STCW*95; * The navy officer of the \\"energy and propulsion\\" stream by the certificate of \\"engine watch leader\\"; At the end of that year, the midshipmen are given the rank of ensign, and they are sent to follow the \\"maritime superior formation and specialization\\" (see underneath).

He planned to assassinate Elizabeth I of England, and was executed. Early life He was the son of Harry ap David, a gentleman of Northop, Flintshire, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Pyrs or Peter Conway, archdeacon of St. Asaph and rector of Northop. Harry ap David, on his son's account, was in the guard to Henry VIII, and died about 1566, leaving fourteen children by his first wife and sixteen by his second, Parry's mother. Parry was originally named William ap Harry. Parry was apprenticed to John Fisher of Chester, who had some legal knowledge in law; he attended a grammar school, and made attempts to escape from his master. He went to London to seek his fortune. A marriage with a Mrs. Powell, widow, and daughter of Sir William Thomas, brought him some income. In the household of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke until the Earl's death in 1570, Parry then entered the Queen's service. He appears to have involved himself in financial difficulties, despite a second marriage to money. Spy Parry sought a commission from Lord Burghley to spy on Catholics on the Continent of Europe, with the idea of escaping his creditors. On a first trip abroad he visited Rome, Siena, and other places. In 1577 he was back in England, though still short of money. In 1579 he left the country again abruptly; he wrote to Burghley from Paris excusing his conduct, and Burghley put Anthony Bacon in touch with him. Around this time Parry covertly joined the Roman Catholic Church. In 1580 Parry again returned to England. in November, after renewed proceedings by his creditors, he made a personal assault on Hugh Hare, one of them, in the Inner Temple. Parry was convicted and sentenced to death. He received a pardon from the Queen. He found sureties for his debts, one of whom was Sir John Conway, a connection of his mother's. On a third trip abroad in 1582, Parry appears to have become a double agent, going over to the Catholic side and considering Elizabeth's assassination. He began by urging a policy of conciliation towards Catholics in England, and recommending pardon for some prominent catholic refugees, including John and Thomas Roper, Sir Thomas Copley, and Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland. He then encountered Charles Paget and Thomas Morgan of Llantarnam, and read works of Cardinal William Allen. He sought approval for an assassination scheme in various Catholic quarters, in France and Italy. Informant On his return to England in 1584, Parry disclosed some of his dealings to the Queen, claiming to have acted only to cover Protestant plots. She pardoned him; Parry started to demand rewards. The Queen pensioned him, and rewarded him with a seat in Parliament for Queenborough. Parry was at this point playing a double game. He tried the effect of a protest in parliament against the treatment of Catholics. However, Parry was still unable to pay off his debts, and attempted to manufacture another plot to be \\"discovered\\". He approached Sir Edmund Neville and suggested to him that they should ride up and shoot the Queen in her coach, or kill her during a private audience. According to some accounts, Parry did attempt to carry out the assassination, but lost his courage before he could do the deed. However, it is unclear whether he genuinely intended to kill the Queen, or to raise his own standing by \\"exposing\\" Neville. Parliament met on 23 November, and one of its first acts was to debate a bill against Jesuits and seminary priests. On its third reading (17 December), Parry denounced it; he was committed to the sergeant-at-arms, placed on his knees at the bar, and required to explain his words. He was carried off in custody and examined by the privy council. The next day he was released by an order from the Queen. Six weeks later Neville informed against his fellow-conspirator, stating that he had plotted to murder the queen while she was driving in the park. Parry was arrested on a charge of high treason, and placed in the Tower of London. He wrote a full confession to the Queen, and sent letters to Burghley and Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. Death On 11 February 1585 Parry was expelled from Parliament, and on 18 February his trial began. Perhaps in the hope of pardon, he pleaded guilty, but he subsequently declared his innocence, said that his confession was a tissue of falsehoods, and that Ptolomeo Galli, the Cardinal of Como, had never given any countenance to the murder. He was condemned to death, and executed on 2 March in Westminster Palace Yard. On the scaffold he again declared his innocence, and appealed to the Queen for a more lenient treatment of her Catholic subjects. After Parry's death a work, published, probably, at the instance of the government, and entitled A true and plain Declaration of the Horrible Treasons practised by William Parry, charged him with various atrocious crimes. It also made remarks on his, birth and parentage.

Of these, one (of Snape) was restored from abeyance in 1913; one (of Braybrook) is forfeit; the other two (both of Corby) are dormant, although their heir is well known. Name and title All of these, and the title of Viscount Latimer, belong to the descendants of the same medieval family, whose surname was Latimer (Latiner or \\"translator\\"); the fourteenth-century form of the name should therefore be le Latimer, but it is often found as de Latimer as though it were a placename.Fourteenth century spelling is quite variable: Latimer, Latymer, Lattimore, Lattymere are all attested. Modern sources tend to use Baron Latimer for all four peerages, except for the 1913 revival of the 1423 Nevill peerage (which the twentieth century Money Coutts peers spell Latymer), and Complete Peerage calls them Baron Latimer too.

The stems of a cross patonce should expand, as a cross patt√©e, then terminate more or less like a cross flory. The earliest surviving representation is on the seal of William Latimer, 1st Baron Latimer (died 1305), affixed to the Barons' Letter of 1301 to the Pope. The arms of William le Latimer were blazoned in Franco-Norman verse by the heralds in the Caerlaverock Roll of Arms made in Scotland during the Siege of Caerlaverock in 1300 as follows: :De Guilleme le Latimer portoit en rouge bien pourtraite. Ki la crois pat√©e de or mier (\\"William le Latimer bore in red well painted the cross pat√©e of gold ...\\") The term \\"patee\\" in this verse of the poem should not be interpreted as paty, or patt√©e, but rather as patonce.See H.S. London, 'Paty and Formy', Coat of Arms, iii (1955) pp: 285-6.) His cross patonce is also displayed in a contemporary stained glass window in Dorchester Church. In the blazons of the Latimer arms in subsequent rolls the cross is blazoned as patee and patey, though in later times as cross patonce: *Sire William de LATIMER: de goules, a un croys patee de or (Roll, tempore.

The late-medieval heraldic Angevin French terms patee and patey were incorrectly considered equivalent to the 18th century heraldic English pat√©e by most heralds of the 19th century,see Parker's Heraldry supposing an early variance in the family arms. But throughout the 14th century the arms consistently displayed Gules, a cross patonce or. One 19th century archivist incorrectly described the cross patonce of William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer, as a cross flory.\\"William Lord Latimer‚Ä¶ Arms: Gules, a cross flory Or.

The oldest writs for the Latimers date from 1299, although the first Baron Latimer also sat in the Parliament of 1290. *William Latimer, 1st Baron Latimer (died 1305).

The Earl died in 1425, and the lands were passed on to George Neville, one of his younger sons, who was summoned to Parliament as Baron Latimer (second creation). By modern law, however, the ancient Latimer title could not be transferred by will. John Neville's sisters had both predeceased him. Margaret had died unmarried, and Elizabeth had married Sir Thomas Willoughby, one of her step-father's younger sons, so the Barony of Latimer is held to have passed to her son and heir, Sir John Willoughby.

Robert Willoughby, who was one of Henry VII's military commanders, was summoned to Parliament under the style of Baron Willoughby de Broke in 1491. Richard Neville, 2nd Baron Latimer, the grandson of George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer above, sat in the same Parliament, having just come of age. There were land disputes between the two families, and the new Baron Willoughby de Broke claimed that he should have been summoned as Baron Latimer. Richard Neville responded through his counsel that baronies by writ were inherited in the male line; when John Neville died, his barony became extinct; his grandfather had been granted a new Barony of Latimer, because there wasn't one. The decision was that there were two baronies of Latimer. Robert Willoughby was heir to the older one, created in 1299, and had a right to claim it, but the summons to George Neville in 1432 had created a second barony of Latimer. The land dispute was settled by a marriage between the younger members of the family, and Robert Willoughby chose not to claim the barony of Latimer. He already had a seat in the House of Lords. : 9 Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke (c.1452‚Äì1502; repeated from above) :10 Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke (1472‚Äì1521), often called Lord Broke or Brooke. :*His son, Edward Willoughby, (c.1495 - November 1517) married Margaret Neville, eldest daughter of Richard Neville, 2nd Baron Latimer, and died in his father's lifetime. The death of the second Baron Willoughby de Broke gave rise to another clarification of peerage law. His son, Edward Willoughby, who predeceased him, left three daughters, two of whom, Anne and Blanche, died childless. The survivor, Elizabeth Willoughby (the greatest heiress of her time), married Sir Fulke Greville. Neither she nor her eldest son, another Fulke Greville, nor her grandson, Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke, claimed the title. His grand-nephew and heir general, Sir Richard Verney, claimed the title of Lord Brooke in 1694 as the heir of Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke; this petition was rejected. However, in 1696 he made a second application, and it was decided that Elizabeth Willoughby had succeeded to the title about 1535, at her youngest sister's death - and Richard Verney therefore became Baron Willoughby de Broke. :11 Elizabeth Willoughby, 3rd Baroness Willoughby de Broke, granddaughter.

Barons Latimer or Latymer (of Snape; 1432) As said above, George Neville, a younger son of the first Earl of Westmorland, succeeded to the lands of his uncle, John Neville, 6th Baron Latimer, although he was not descended from the ancient Latimers. He was summoned to Parliament as Baron Latimer in 1432; by modern law, as decided in the 1490s, this was a new creation of a new Barony of Latimer. It descended as follows. *George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer (died 1469) *Richard Neville, 2nd Baron Latimer (1468‚Äì1530), grandson. *John Neville, 3rd Baron Latimer (1493‚Äì1543), son. **Married three times. His first wife was Dorothy de Vere, sister and eventual co-heiress of John de Vere, 14th Earl of Oxford; his third wife - and widow - was Catherine Parr, later Queen of England. *John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer (1520‚Äì1577), only son (his mother was Dorothy de Vere). These Barons Latimer held Snape Castle in Wensleydale. John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer, had four daughters, all of whom had issue. #Catherine Percy, Countess of Northumberland. #Dorothy Cecil, afterward Countess of Exeter. #Lucy Cornwallis. #Elizabeth Danvers. Tudor custom was divided on what happened in such a case; the style of Lord Latimer was claimed both by the Earls and Dukes of Northumberland, descendants of his eldest daughter, and by his cousin and heir male, another Richard Neville (died 1590), son of William Neville, younger brother of the 3rd Baron Latimer. Modern law, as worked out over the next century, was that the barony was divided into quarters among the four daughters and their heirs, a situation called abeyance. If three of the lines died out, the fourth would inherit; if not, the Crown might, at its pleasure, confer the title on any of the heirs - customarily, the one who petitioned for it. Lucy Cornwallis had only daughters, so her share was itself divided. In 1911, the heritor of one of these sub-shares (Francis Burdett Thomas Money- Coutts, of the prominent Liberal banking family) petitioned that the abeyance be determined, and in February 1913, he was summoned to Parliament. He and his heirs have chosen to spell their title Latymer, and most sources follow them. *Francis Money-Coutts, 5th Baron Latymer (1852‚Äì1923) (abeyance terminated 1913) *Hugh Burdett Money-Coutts, 6th Baron Latymer (1876‚Äì1949), son *Thomas Burdett Money-Coutts, 7th Baron Latymer (1901‚Äì1987), son *Hugo Nevill Money- Coutts, 8th Baron Latymer (1926‚Äì2003), son *Crispin James Alan Nevill Money- Coutts, 9th Baron Latymer (b. 1955), son The heir apparent is the present holder's son the Hon. Drummond William Thomas Money-Coutts (b. 1986)Complete Peerage, \\"Latimer or Latymer (Nevill), Vol VII, pp. 479‚Äì486, and supplement Vol XIV, Barons Latimer (of Corby; 1299; bis) William, the first Lord Latimer above named, was of an advanced age when he received his first recorded writ of summons, to the Parliament of Christmas 1299. He is recorded as having sat in one of the Parliaments of 1290, but no writ is recorded; by modern law no peerage was formed. Two members of his family were summoned and sat in Parliament in his lifetime: his eldest son, another William, and his nephew Thomas. The younger Sir William Latimer was summoned to, and sat in, the Parliament of Candlemas, 1299, ten months before his father, and continued to be summoned for the rest of his life. By modern law, this would create a separate Barony of Latimer, although the two have been held by the same people since the elder Sir William's death in 1305. This barony is therefore also dormant, although the heir is, like the other barony of 1299, also the present Baron Willoughby de Broke. If David Verney, 21st Baron Willoughby de Broke claimed this title, he would be 28th Baron Latimer, but have somewhat higher precedence.Complete Peerage, Vol VII, p. 465 Barons Latimer (of Braybrook; 1299) Sir William Latimer, first Baron Latimer above, was also accompanied to the Parliament of Christmas 1299 by his nephew, Sir Thomas le Latimer, who was summoned by writ and sat; Sir William and his late brother Sir John had married sisters, the heiresses of Walter Ledet of Braybrook and Corby; each of the brothers had inherited one of the castles, and Sir John had died at the end of 1282. This summons created a fourth Barony of Latimer by modern law, although Thomas Latimer, first Lord Latimer of this line, was only summoned until 1308, and none of his heirs were summoned at all. Complete Peerage traces the line of descent as follows: *Thomas le Latimer (c. 1270 ‚Äì 1334), founder. *Warin le Latimer (c. 1300 ‚Äì 1349), son. **Married Catherine la Warre, daughter of John la Warr, 2nd Baron De La Warr *John le Latimer (c. 1323 ‚Äì 1356), son. *Warin le Latimer (c. 1341 ‚Äì 1361), brother. *Thomas le Latimer (1341‚Äì1401), brother *Edward le Latimer (c. 1345 ‚Äì 1411), brother *John Griffin (c. 1380 ‚Äì 1445), great-nephew **Grandson of Elizabeth Griffin, n√©e Latimer, sister of the previous heirs. *Nicholas Griffin, (1426‚Äì1482), nephew. *John Griffin (1454‚Äì1485), son *Nicholas Griffin (1474‚Äì1509), son *Thomas Griffin (1485‚Äì1566), son **His son, Rice Griffin, was killed 1549, in Kett's Rebellion, leaving a daughter: *Mary Griffin, (before 1546 - ?), granddaughter, married Thomas Markham. *Griffin Markham (c. 1570 - after 1644), attainted 1603. Sir Griffin Markham was one of the bravoes employed in the Bye Plot, an effort to kidnap James I of England and Scotland. He was attainted and exiled, at which point this shadowy peerage became forfeit. Unless this attainder were reversed, this barony would not belong to anybody. Even if it were, it is not clear who could claim it, since the accounts of Markham's family vary. One source says he left two daughters, another that he was childless; one that he himself was one of twelve sons, yet another that he was one of six sons and there were four daughters.Complete Peerage, Vol VII pp. 450‚Äì460. Viscount Latimer Thomas Osborne, the Restoration politician, worked his way up from a baronetcy to being first Duke of Leeds. In this climb, his third peerage title was Viscount Latimer, conferred 15 August 1673; he was to become Earl of Danby the next June. All of Osborne's titles are now extinct at the death of the last Duke of Leeds in 1964; but Viscount Latimer was used as a title of courtesy for Osborne's eldest son from 1674 to his death, in his father's lifetime, in January 1689. This title does recognize Osborne as a member of this same extended family: his grandmother was the daughter of Elizabeth Danvers, fourth daughter of John Nevill, 4th Baron Latimer, of the 1432 creation. He had no share in the abeyance; his grandmother had three brothers, his great-uncles: Charles Danvers, Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby, and John Danvers the regicide, and her own heir was his uncle Thomas Walmesley, whose heir is the present Baron Petre.Complete Peerage, \\"Leeds\\", Vol VII, pp. 507‚Äì510 and supplement Vol XIV.

Historically this area was covered by tropical dry deciduous forest, but this only remains in isolated fragments. The vegetation now consists of mainly of southern tropical thorn scrub type forests. These consist of open woodland with thorny trees with short trunks and low, branching crowns; spiny and xerophytic shrubs; and dry grassland. This is the habitat of the great Indian bustard and blackbuck, though these and other animals are declining in numbers; this area was at one time home to large numbers of elephants and tigers. Almost 350 species of bird have been recorded here. The remaining natural habitat is threatened by overgrazing and invasive weeds, but there are a number of small protected areas which provide a haven for the wildlife. Trees in these forests have adapted to not require much water. Location and description This ecoregion covers the semi-arid portions of the Deccan Plateau, extending across the Indian states of Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu to the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Only small patches of natural habitat remain, as most of the region has been cleared for grazing. The annual rainfall is less than , all falling during the short rainy season, and the area receives no rainfall during the months of November to April. Temperatures can exceed during the hotter months. Flora Today the remaining forest is mostly southern tropical thorn scrub,Champion, H. G., and S. K. Seth. 1968. A revised survey of the forest types of India. Government of India Press and also includes patches of the original vegetation, tropical dry deciduous forests. The southern tropical thorn scrub forests consist of open, low vegetation with thorny trees with short trunks and low, branching crowns that rarely meet to form a closed canopy. The trees grow up to . Typical grasses of the ecoregion include Chrysopogon fulvus, Heteropogon contortus, Eremopogon foveolatus, Aristida setacea, and Dactyloctenium species. The second storey of the thorn scrub forests in Maharashtra is poorly developed and mainly consists spiny and xerophytic species, mostly shrubs. An ill-defined lower storey can also be seen during the brief wet season. The plant species that dominate the vegetation in these forests are Acacia species, Balanites roxburghii, Cordia myxa, Capparis spp., Prosopis spp., Azadirachta indica, Cassia fistula, Diospyros chloroxylon, Carissa carandas, and Phoenix sylvestris. There are also several other habitat types found in these forests. The driest, rockiest areas of the ecoregion are covered with a scrub dominated by species of Euphorbia. The soil is usually bare in these areas; however, some grassy growth may also appear during the short monsoon season. The parts of the ecoregion found in Tamil Nadu receive even less rainfall than most, and the vegetation in these parts is mainly made up of thinly spread thorny forests of Acacia planifrons, with umbrella-shaped crowns. The remaining patches of forest are also home to a large number of plants, some of medicinal and botanical interest, including an endemic cycad (Cycas beddomei) and Psilotum nudum. A small patch of the tree Shorea talura also exists within the Chittoor forest division, part of which is being maintained as a preservation plot by the Forest Department of Andhra Pradesh. Finally, the area between the Nallamala and Seshachalam Hills is well known for the red sanders (Pterocarpus santalinus), a rare, endemic tree species that is harvested for the medicinal value of its wood. Fauna The dry grasslands that predominate do provide habitat for the native fauna remaining scattered amid the thorn forest. The grasslands of southern Andhra Pradesh support a good population of the great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra), although these and other species are declining in number. The forests used to provide habitat for three prominent mammal species, the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), the Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), whose populations have recently dwindled and may have even become locally extinct, and the nilgai antelope (Boselaphus tragocamelus). The ecoregion is home to 96 mammal species, out of which three are considered endemic: split roundleaf bat (Hipposideros schistaceus), Kondana soft-furred rat (Millardia kondana), and Elvira rat (Cremnomys elvira). Other threatened mammal species found in these forests include the tiger, gaur (Bos gaurus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), sloth bear (Melursus ursinus), chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra). Little-known ones like the Slender loris also occur here. The Deccan thorn scrub forests are home to a richer variety of birds: almost 350 species, of which three are considered near-endemic: Jerdon's courser (Rhinoptilus bitorquatus), Sri Lanka junglefowl (Gallus lafayetii), and yellow-fronted barbet (Megalaima flavifrons). Among these, the Jerdon's courser is also considered a globally threatened species, and was rediscovered in this ecoregion in 1986 after being recorded for the last time in 1900. Other globally threatened bird species such as the lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus) and Indian bustard can also be found in the ecoregion. Over 60 species of herpetofauna are known to occur in such forest types. Unique species of amphibians and reptiles do occur here. Such species include the Duttaphrynus hololius, lizards viz. Hemidactylus scabriceps, Hemidactylus reticulatus, Ophisops leschenaultii, Eutropis beddomii and snakes viz. Coluber bholanathi, Chrysopelea taprobanica. Apart from such forms, most of the widespread species of herpetofauna, occurring on a pan-Indian scale, including the endangered Indian star tortoise, Indian chameleon, and Bengal monitor also occur here. Threats and conservation The remaining deciduous woodland continues to be cleared for grazing while the pasture that has been created is itself threatened by overgrazing and invasive weeds. One large area of natural forest remains in southern Andhra Pradesh. Protected areas 9,430 km¬≤, or 3%, of the ecoregion is within protected areas.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017).

The Yaudheyas emerged in the 5th century BCE. They not only survived the Maurya Empire and Shunga Empire, but also the Kshatraps and Kushan Empire. The Yaudheya Republic flourished up to the middle to the 4th century when it was conquered by Samudragupta and incorporated into the Gupta Empire.  Geography  The Yaudheyas formed in the land between the Indus river and the Ganges river, called Bahudhanyaka, with their capital in Khokrakot (Rohtak). Bahudhanyaka was originally composed of modern-day Haryana. Early Yaudheya coins were additionally found in East Punjab, and North Rajasthan, and Western Uttar Pradesh. They also governed Garhwal, Kumaon, and Himachal Pradesh, in their later military campaigns. Yaudheya coins have been excavated as far as Bahawalpur in Pakistan. In the Mahabharata, the land Bahudhanyaka is stated to be among the countries subjugated by Nakula, the fourth Pandava in his conquest. Bahudhanyaka was the first to fall in Nakulas in of the western direction toward Sakastan, which agrees with the Rohtak-Hisar area. Varahamihira in his Brihatsamhita (XIV.28 and XVI.22) placed them in the northern division of India. Literature Puranas (e.g. Brahmanda, Vayu, Brahma and Harivamsha) described Yaudheyas as the descendants of Usinara and Nrigu.Pargiter, F.E. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition Motilal Banarasidass, Delhi, 1972 pp.109 There are other references to them namely in the Mahabharata, Mahamayuri, Brihatsamhita, Puranas, Chandravyakarana and Kashika. In the Mahabharata, the land Bahudhanyaka is stated to be among the countries subjugated by Nakula, the fourth Pandava. Bahudhanyaka was the first to fall to Nakulas conquest in of the western direction toward Sakastan, which agrees with the Rohtak-Hisar area. Varahamihira in his Brihatsamhita (XIV.28 and XVI.22) placed them in the northern division of India. They are mentioned in PƒÅ·πáini's Ashtadhyayi and Ganapatha. History  Rise of the Republic  Late Vedic Culture (1100-500_BCE) The Yaudheyas emerged as an entity following the decline of the Kuru Kingdom (c. 1200 BCE‚Äìc. 525 BCE). The Yaudheyas would eventually encompass the land formerly belonging to the Kurus, including their former capitals Indraprastha, Hastinapur, and ƒÄsandƒ´vat. The Kuru Kingdom which was the prominent power in the Vedic age fell in importance when compared to the other Mahajanapadas. The earliest references of the existence of the Yaudheyas is in PƒÅ·πáini's Ashtadhyayi (V.3.116-17 and IV.1.178) of (c.500 BCE) and the Ganapatha. In his works the Yaudheyas are mentioned as ayudha-jivin sanghas i.e., a community living by the profession of arms. The region of Bahudhanyaka was ruled by the Yaudheyas who minted coins bearing the legend 'Bahudhanyaka Yaudheyanam'. Coin of the Yaudheyas with depiction of KumƒÅra Karttikeya, 1st century BCE, Punjab.  Maurya Empire  The Yaudheyas were incorporated into the Maurya Empire by Chandragupta Maurya. They also annexed the Pauravas. Chandragupta, under the tutelage of Chanakya, won over local kingdoms and republics in Punjab before conquering the Nanda Empire. Chandragupta heavily relied on the Yaudheya Gana in his campaigns. His military had a high representation of the Yaudheya Gana and similar republicans. Additionally, Yaudheya elites and chiefs in were appointed government positions. As recorded in the Bijoygarh inscription commissioned around Ashokas reign, the Yaudheya-gana-puraskrta appointed a chief who held the title of Maharaja-Senapati. This chief of the Yaudheya republic was appointed the Mahasenapati or 'Great Commander of the Army' for the Mauryan military. The Arthashastra written by Chanakya described the senapati as adept in all modes of warfare (sarvayudha), all weapons (praharana), possessing modesty and restraint (vidyavinita), and capable of controlling all four wings of the army (chaturangini sena).  Post Maurya Empire  Soon after the death of Pushyamitra Shunga and Menander I, the Yaudheyas particularly asserted themselves independent. Yaudheyas mention military victories on their coins (\\"Victory of the Arjunayanas\\", \\"Victory of the Yaudheyas\\"). It is thought the Yaudheyas had become an independent kingdom at that point.\\"Most of the people east of the Ravi already noticed as within Menander's empire -Audumbaras, Trigartas, Kunindas, Yaudheyas, Arjunayanas- began to coins in the first century BC, which means that they had become independent kingdoms or republics.\\", Tarn, The Greeks in Bactria and India p.324. In the second and first century BC the Yaudheyas occupied the Haryana (Bahudhanyaka) portion of Greater Punjab; comprising Rohtak, Hissar, Karnal and Gurugram, as well as the adjoining desert of Marwar. Defeat against the Western Satraps (2nd century CE) During the second century CE when the Yaudheya gana revolted against the foreigners but they were soon checked by Rudradaman I. The Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman (c. 150 CE)Junagadh Rock Inscription of Rudradaman I, accessed on 23 March 2007. acknowledged the military might of the Yaudheyas \\"who would not submit because they were proud of their title \\"heroes among the Kshatriyas\\"\\", although the inscription claims that they were ultimately vanquished by Rudradaman.Rosenfield, \\"The dynastic art of the Kushans\\", p132Rapson, \\"A catalogue of the Indian coins in the British Museum\\", p.lx Kushan Empire Coin of Kushan ruler Huvishka (152-192 CE), featuring Maaseno, the incarnation of the Karttikeya of the Yaudheyas. It is thought that the Kushans then became suzerains of the Yaudheyas when they endeavoured to hold the Mathura area.Indian Sculpture: Circa 500 B.C.-A.D. 700, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Pratapaditya Pal, University of California Press, 1986, p.78 An indication is the fact that the Kushan ruler Huvishka featured Maaseno on his coins, the Kushan incarnation of the Hindu god Karttikeya, or Skanda, whose epithet was \\"Mahasena\\". This god being particularly important to the Yaudheyas, it may have been incorporated into Kushan coinage when the Kushans expanded into Yaudheya territory.Classical Numismatics Group Feudatories of the Gupta Empire Bijayagadh inscription of the Yaudheyas. The undated inscription reads \\"Perfection has been attained!

Circa 3rd-4th Century AD.jpg|Coin of the Yaudheyas. Circa 3rd-4th Century CE. The Yaudheyas only utilized Brahmi script on their coins and seals. Alexander Cunningham divided the Yaudheya coins into two distinctive kinds; the older and smaller class A coins dating from before the 1st century BCE, and the larger Class B coins from the 3rd century CE during the decline of the Indo-Scythian power. Cunningham states that the later coins evidently copied from the Indo- Scythians money. John Allan classified Yaudheya coins into six classes, while Vincent Arthur Smith previously gave three types. The classification used by Allen has been mostly followed by scholars till today. Yaudheya coins were found in the ancient capital of Khokrakot (modern Rohtak), and Naurangabad. Based on the early coins produced by the Yaudheyas, it can be safely said that Karttikeya was considered their I·π£·π≠a-devatƒÅ. Footnotes Further reading * Dasgupta, K.K.

He was starosta of Zawichost, Tymbark and Kowal. He was also pantler of Sandomierz (1647‚Äì58), Royal Secretary (from 1656), a secular referendary (1658‚Äì68), and Deputy Crown Treasurer from 1668. Apart from his career at the Polish court, Morsztyn is famous as a leading poet of the Polish Baroque and a prominent representative of Marinist style in Polish literature. Over his lifetime he accumulated considerable wealth. In 1683 he was accused of treason and was forced to emigrate to France. Biography Morsztyn was born 24 July 1621 at Wi≈õnicz, near Krak√≥w, into a wealthy Calvinist family of coat-of-arms Leliwa. He studied at Leiden University and, with his brother, traveled extensively in Italy and France. After returning to Poland, he became a retainer of the magnate Lubomirski family, and through them became attached to the royal court. He was a deputy to the Sejms of 1648, 1650, 1653, 1658 and 1659. He served on numerous Sejm commissions for diplomatic, legal and fiscal matters. He took part in diplomatic missions to Hungary (1653), Sweden (1655) and Austria (1656). He was named Royal Secretary in 1656, Crown Referendary in 1658, and Deputy Crown Treasurer in 1668. During those years he took part in many diplomatic missions and negotiations; he was part of the mission that negotiated the Treaty of Oliwa (1660). He fought in The Deluge and in the Chmielnicki Uprising. In politics he represented the pro-French faction, promoting the French candidate in the royal election of 1668, and become a vocal supporter of French policies in the Commonwealth. He accepted French pension and citizenship. When king John III Sobieski distanced himself from France, and allied with Austria, he was accused of treason and emigrated to France in 1683, where he assumed the title of comte de Ch√¢teauvillain and spent the last years of his life as a royal secretary. The Sejm of 1686 stripped him of all offices and titles and banned him from the country. Jan Morsztyn died 8 January 1693 in Paris.  Family and descendants  In 1659 he married Catherine Gordon of Huntly (1635‚Äì1691), the youngest daughter of George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly (1589‚Äì1649) and Lady Anne Campbell, eldest daughter of the seventh Earl of Argyll. She went to Poland with her older brother Scots-born colonel Lord Henry Gordon de Huntly, who served the king of Poland for several years. Lord Gordon returned to Scotland, and died at Strathbogie. Catherine (Katarzyna) was a lady-in-waiting at the Court of Queen Marie Louise de Gonzaga. They had a son and three daughters, who all married members of high European aristocracy, except one daughter who became a nun. They became Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski's parents-in-law, by their younger daughter Isabella Morsztynowna. Through the Czartoryski family, they are : * great-grandparents of Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, the last King of Poland (1732‚Äì1796). The king's mother, Princess Konstancja Czartoryska, is Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski's daughter. * ancestors of Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz, Queen (Consort) of the Belgians. ** explanation : Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski's great-granddaughter Zofia Czartoryska and her husband Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Zamoyski are Prince Leon Sapieha-Kodenski's parents-in-law. Prince Leon's great-great-granddaughter, Princess Zofia Sapieha-Kodenska, is Queen Mathilde's maternal grandmother, who died in a car accident with the princess's sister, Marie-Alix d'Udekem d'Acoz. Jan Andrzej Morsztyn and Catherine Gordon of Huntly are 11th-generation ancestors to Queen Mathilde. Works Jan Andrzej Morsztyn was one of the leading poets of the Polish Baroque. His language was marked by the extravagant style of 16th-century Italian Marinism. He had written most of his works before becoming Deputy Crown Treasurer in 1668. Morsztyn, a courtier and political intriguer, considered his writing a hobby and let most of his works circulate in manuscript, afraid that wider publication could prove damaging to his career. Thus most of his works first appeared in print only in the 19th century. A master of poetic form, he wrote the collections of verses Kaniku≈Ça (Dog Days, 1647) and Lutnia (Lute, 1661). He was concerned less with the \\"worldly happiness\\" but rather, with its inherent self-contradictions, such as paradoxes of love, full both of frivolity and metaphysical fear. Nonetheless some of his other works had political subtones, like Pospolite ruszenie or Pie≈õ≈Ñ w obozie pod ≈ªwa≈Ñcem (Song in the camp near ≈ªwaniec), which criticized szlachta unwillingness to react to potential dangers (from Tatars or Cossacks). Unlike his cousin, Zbigniew Morsztyn, few of his works can be counted as religious poetry, the notable exception being the Pokuta w kwartanie. He was also a known translator (of Torquato Tasso, Giambattista Marino and Pierre Corneille). His translation of Corneiile's Le Cid was the first translation of this work into Polish and has remained the standard Polish version even today. In 1660 he coauthored a proposal for the reform of the Sejm.

In the 1980s through the middle of the 1990s he represented East Germany (and then Germany after 1990) as one of world's best in race walking. His first big win came in 1983 when he won the World title in the 50 km walk. At the Summer Olympic games he won a silver medal in the 20 km walk as well as a silver and a bronze medal in the 50 km walk. He is the only German sportsman to have won Olympic medals in both walking disciplines at the Games. He was unable to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympic Games because of the East German boycott, when he was the overwhelming favourite to win. Weigel represented ASK Vorw√§rts Potsdam, and after reunification he went to OSC Potsdam and then LAC Halensee. He trained with Hans-Joachim Pathus. During his competitive years he was 1.77 meters tall and weighed 62 kilograms.

Life outside sport Weigel started in the sport as a student in his hometown of Hildburghausen and was found to have natural talent. In 1973 he became the East German student champion, and in 1977 he was second at the Junior European championship. As a member of the Army sports club he was Hauptmann in the NVA. After reunification he freely admitted to having worked for the Stasi and was then let go from the sports group of the Bundeswehr without notice. In 1997, Weigel took a position as the Australian national coach in Canberra. He trained the Australian Nathan Deakes who won the bronze medal in the 20 km walk at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games and was the 2007 World Champion over 50 km walk After the games, Weigel went back to Germany and took over from his previous trainer, Hans-Joachim Pathus as the German national trainer. His admitted work for the East German security service was taken into consideration, but was not deemed to be a hindrance in hiring him.

Completed in 1983 at a cost of $10 million, it was one of the last major construction projects on the Blue Ridge Parkway which runs linking Shenandoah National Park to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Built mostly along the spine of the Blue Ridge, the parkway was fully completed and opened for through traffic in 1987. History Viaduct Setting Construction of the parkway began in 1935 with the initial plan calling for a viaduct given the effects that a traditional cut- and-fill road would have on Grandfather Mountain. Towering almost , this mountain is the highest and most rugged peak on the Blue Ridge and geologically the most ancient mountain on the North American continent. Conservationists who hoped to preserve the area as a mountain park/recreation area were behind the viaduct concept as they stressed the danger of irreparable damage by lumbering and other exploitation, along with the need to preserve the view of the mountain as it then existed. By 1966, the parkway was essentially complete except for the 7.7 mile section that circled around Grandfather Mountain despite the concerted efforts of the government to acquire the needed property, a task which eventually took 40 years. Design and Construction Viaduct Erection Scheme Viaduct/Tanawha Trail The viaduct was designed by Figg and Muller Engineers, Inc. with construction beginning in 1979. Some long and a little less than wide, the viaduct rests on seven piers. What made its construction noteworthy was keeping heavy construction equipment off the ground. Building the bridge from its south side, this was done by connecting 153 segments one at a time using a custom crane that moved along the viaduct as it was being built. Each segment, nominally long and weighing 50 tons, was precast at a facility onsite and moved on a carriage to the crane. All but one of these segments were slightly curved as the viaduct needed to be shaped in a \\"S-and-a-half\\" figure to follow the contours of the mountain. The only work done on the ground involved drilling the footings for the piers which also were built in a segmental manner. The viaduct has received numerous design awards to include the 1984 President's Design Award which states ‚Ä¶construction of the roadway by pre-cast, segmental concrete elements set from above on segmental piers is elegant, economical, and new‚Ä¶ results in an elegant curving ribbon that caresses the terrain without using it as a support. It gives the motorist the sensation of driving tantalizing on air while the earth goes by.\\" Environs The National Park Service operates the Linn Cove Visitor Center at the viaduct's south end which also features a bridge museum and provides access to the Tanawha Trail which runs from Beacon Heights to Julian Price Memorial Park.

The company manufactures other chocolate products, but Ibarra table chocolate is its best-known product, with presence throughout Mexico as well as international markets, mainly in the Americas, but also in parts of Europe. It is often found in gourmet shops. Ibarra tablets are packaged in a distinctive red-and-yellow hexagon-shaped cardboard box. Each circular tablet of table chocolate is about 1/2\\" thick and 3\\" in diameter, and is molded into 8 wedges. The letters of the name \\"IBARRA\\" are also molded into the chocolate. The ingredients are cocoa paste, sugar, cinnamon, and soy lecithin, A premium grade version does not contain vegetable fat, which is often used in chocolate based foods as a less expensive substitute, with the only fat being the cocoa butter in the cocoa liquor. Unlike chocolate bars, and because of its undissolved granulated sugar, and its rough and gritty texture, tablet chocolate is not meant to be eaten like a chocolate bar, although Ibarra tablets can be eaten. However, Ibarra is used primarily to make hot cocoa in traditional Mexican form. The labeling on Ibarra's packaging suggests that the best way to prepare Ibarra is to use approximately two wedges for each cup of milk or water. Heat the milk until it is near boiling, then blend the milk and chocolate in a blender until the chocolate is completely dissolved, and serve hot. Ibarra can also be prepared on the stove by dissolving the wedges in hot milk, then whisking the cocoa with a molinillo or wire whisk. In Mexico, in the traditional Aztec and Mayan form, Cayenne pepper is added to make it a spicy chocolate drink. It is also used in mole sauce.

Story Ten young space cadets are put onto a decommissioned spaceship as their final test. If they pass this test, their lifelong dreams of being valued people in their respective societies will come true. Their orders are to survive as long as they can with what they have. However, once they arrive at the ship, they find that their crew has gained an eleventh member‚Äîand no one can remember the original lineup well enough to recognize which of them is the newcomer. As the days pass, the eleven cadets must deal with their suspicions of each other as well as the sudden knowledge that the spaceship is in a decaying orbit around a star, which is causing the temperature on the ship to rise. With this rise in temperature, a sickness begins to spread among the crew as they work to stabilize their orbit and determine who among them is the spy.

Though not a practitioner himself, his two major publications, Parall√®le de l'architecture antique avec la moderne (1650) and Id√©e de la perfection de la peinture (1662), appeared at a time when French architects were struggling to apply a new sense of discipline and order to the practice of building. Early life and trips to Italy Roland Fr√©art was born in Le Mans, France. In 1630 he travelled to Italy, returning to France in 1635. While in Rome he studied architecture and met the collector Cassiano dal Pozzo and the painter Nicolas Poussin, as well as the artists Charles Errard and Jacques Stella.Dauvois 2008. Roland and his brother (Paul Fr√©art, sieur de Chantelou, or possibly Jean Fr√©art, sieur de Chantelou) were sent to Rome in 1639 and 1640, commissioned by their cousin Fran√ßois Sublet de Noyers, the superintendent of the B√¢timents du Roi, to secure the services of Poussin (\\"the best French artist in Rome\\") and to arrange for casts and copies to be made of the best antiquities in Roman collections, for the French royal palaces.There has been some confusion concerning which of his two brothers (Jean or Paul, both known as sieur de Chantelou) accompanied him to Rome. Roland Fr√©art himself wrote that \\"the late M. de Noyers dispatched us, You and my Self (dear Brother)\\" (Fr√©art de Chambray 1723, p. xiii of The Epistle, but Roland's epistle is addressed to both brothers, p. x of The Epistle). Blunt 1967, p. 157, says only \\"Chantelou was sent to Rome to fetch him [Poussin]\\" (and in the index Chantelou is identified as Paul Fr√©art de Chantelou). Haskell & Penny 1981, p. 32, identify Roland's companion as Jean. Asfour 1996 identifies Roland's companion as Paul (and gives the date as 1639). Bull 1996 writes that in 1638 Paul became secretary to Sublet de Noyers and \\"it was in this capacity that he visited Italy (where he may already have spent time with Roland) in 1639 and 1640. On the latter occasion he brought Poussin back to Paris\\". Poussin arrived in Paris (with Chantelou) in December 1640.Blunt 1967, p. 157. Casts of bas-reliefs sent back to Paris found use in the decor of the ceiling compartments in the Grande Galerie of the Palais du Louvre. There were also seventy casts from reliefs of sections of Trajan's Column.Haskell & Penny 1981, p. 32. Chantelou returned to Italy in 1643, with projects to cast the colossal horsemen of the Quirinal in bronze for the main entrance to the Louvre, but the death of Cardinal Richelieu, the disgrace of Sublet de Noyers and the death of the King (1642‚Äì43) brought these ambitious projects to naught. Writings Fr√©art de Chambray completed a translation of the full text of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri (Venice 1570) into FrenchLes quatre livres de l‚Äôarchitecture d‚ÄôAndr√© Palladio: mis en fran√ßois: dans lesquels, apr√©s un petit traitt√© des cinq ordres, avec quelques-unes des plus n√©cessaires observations pour bien bastir, il parle de la construction des maisons particulieres, des grands chemins, des ponts, des places publiques, des xystes, des basiliques, & des temples. (Paris: Edme Martin) 1650. for the first time. An earlier publication of the first book only, by Pierre Le Muet (1645), had made a very free translation, adjusted to conform to French practice; it proved popular and was freely pirated in the following decades. Publication of Fr√©art's translation, completed about 1641, which had also been commissioned by his cousin Sublet de Noyers, was delayed as Sublet de Noyers was first disgraced (1643), then died in 1645. Following a stay in Rome, Fr√©art published it in Paris in 1650. Its \\"D√©dicace √† ses fr√®res\\" is an open letter to his brother connoisseurs and patrons, hoping \\"to banish this capricious and monstrous fashion of building that some moderns have unhappily introduced as a heresy in the art, by I know not what licentiousness against its precepts and Reason itself\\".\\"de bannir cette capricieuse et monstrueuse fa√ßon de b√¢tir, que quelques modernes ont malheureusement introduite comme une h√©r√©sie dans l‚Äôart, par je ne sais quel libertinage contre ses pr√©ceptes et la raison m√™me.\\" Fr√©art substitutes his elegant and literate dedication for Palladio's original dedication, and reprints the woodcuts from the Venice edition, which he had brought to Paris for the express purpose. The same year, 1650, he published an anthology of ten ancient and modern writers on the classical orders, his Parall√®le de l‚Äôarchitecture antique avec la moderne, which marked the first complete translation of Vitruvius into French and upheld the superiority of the Ancients over the Moderns, a polemic that was to erupt in the following decades into a virtual culture war. In his preface, Fr√©art de Chambray argues that the Classical orders (the Doric, the Ionic, and Corinthian) which he assigns to Greek precedents, are perfect models for all architecture; he condemns the \\"Roman orders\\" (the Tuscan and the Composite) as corrupt. Citing the use of the Corinthian order in the Temple of Solomon, he declares it to be the ‚Äòflower of Architecture and the Order of Orders'. To Fr√©art de Chambray, who illustrated his text with copious engravings, Vitruvius and his translators were beyond reproach. His Parall√®le was translated into English‚Äî the translator was the distinguished connoisseur John Evelyn‚Äî as A parallel of the antient architecture with the modern: in a collection of ten principal authors who have written upon the five orders ... (London:\\"Printed by Tho. Roycroft for John Place\\") 1664. In 1651, he put his excellent command of Italian and his connoisseurship to good use in a translation of Leonardo da Vinci's Trattato della pittura. His Id√©e de la perfection de la peinture appeared in 1662, providing a text that was fundamental to French academic painting into the following century.

It is a member of the Geneva Area City School District and is the largest school within the system. History The settlement of Geneva became an incorporated village in 1866. In 1807, the village built its first public school on Eagle Hill on the South Ridge; a one-room school built of logs. In 1868, the village passed a tax levy and constructed a building to house the Geneva Normal School. The purpose was to address a persistent shortage of teachers for the common schools in the area. This school was not a high school. Rather, it offered normal and commercial courses along with music to prepare students for teaching. Later, it also housed public school students in the higher grades. In 1871 the community of East Geneva built a two-room schoolhouse. The school served children in grades one through twelve. The East Geneva School District consolidated with the Geneva Area School District in 1960. In 1872 the first Geneva students completed twelve years of education. The graduating class of 1872 had just four students. These students had attended upper grade classes at the Geneva Normal School. It was not until 1881 that the village opened its first brick school building on the site where the old post office now stands. The school served students in grades one through eight. Plans were also in the works to build a new high school. 1884 was the year the last high school class graduated from the Geneva Normal School. There were eight graduating Seniors. Construction was nearly complete on the new high school building. The new school opened in September 1884 serving students in grades nine through twelve. It was designed for two hundred students. Two high schools were built in Geneva in 1924: Geneva High School and East Geneva Rural School. East Geneva Rural School served students in grades seven through twelve. Geneva High School served students in grades nine through twelve. Three hundred eighty students moved into the new Geneva High School on January 7, 1925. The school, built in 1923-24, cost $290,000. In 1937, East Geneva Rural School changed its name to Platt R. Spencer School, in honor of Platt Rogers Spencer, the originator of Spencerian penmanship. In 1957, a brand-new high school was opened and the original Geneva High School became Geneva Junior High School. The new school was named Geneva High School. Then, in 1970, an addition was made onto the new high school, allowing the building to serve students in grades seven through twelve. Because of this, Geneva Junior High School was renamed Geneva Elementary School to serve students in grades kindergarten through six, and Spencer School became an elementary school, also to serve students in grades kindergarten through six. The high school was renamed to Geneva Junior High School and began serving students in grades seven and eight, and the new addition was named Geneva High School and began serving students in grades nine through twelve. Geneva High School. In 2006, another new high school was constructed, and students from the old Geneva High School in grades nine through twelve were moved into the new building for the second semester of the 2005-2006 school year. The new high school apparently experiences large leakage from the roofs when it rains. Geneva Junior High remained, though the old high school remains vacant. The board of education has converted the old high school to a middle school for grades six through eight. Conversion for the old HS is nearing completion as is a brand new Spencer Elementary. Both projects were completed in time for the 2010-2011 school year. Mission statement \\"The Mission of Geneva High School is to nurture social skills academic excellence and values enabling students to become responsible, compassionate citizens with lifelong understandings of the arts, science, and humanities.\\" Notable alumni * Edith M. Thomas, Class of 1872, one of the first four graduates of Geneva High School. Besides her many poems, Thomas authored sixteen books. Her work was highly praised in England and America. * Archie Bell, Class of 1895, covered drama and music for Cleveland newspapers for over 30 years. * Brian Anderson, a former Major League Baseball pitcher with several teams, attended and graduated from Geneva High School. His high school baseball jersey is on display in a trophy case. Geneva High School also is the home of three state champions: Mark Debevc, Nadine Cox, and Danielle Nicholson. Mark Debevc won his state championship in the discus in 1967. Mark continued his education at The Ohio State University where he played football. Nadine Cox also won her state championship in the discus thirteen years later in 1980. Nadine continued her education at The Ohio State University and is currently a family doctor. Most currently, Danielle Nicholson won the state championship in Girls' Golf in 2011 as a freshman. Danielle came back from a five shot deficit to shoot scores of 73-70 and claim the OHSAA Division I State Championship. Mark, Nadine, and Danielle have their pictures visible in the school display case. Controversy In October 2015, student Hayden Long, along with five others, were confronted by school administrators and an officer at a homecoming dance on school property. The administrators were claimed to have confronted the students over their belief that the students smelled like marijuana and suspended them for ten days on the spot. The students were then taken into custody by police, where their cars were searched and they were questioned while their parents were barred from being with the students. Hayden Long would end up committing suicide that week, but it has been concluded that the events were not the complete cause. The school and local police department faced criticisms over their actions in the aftermath of Long's death. School administrators would defer responsibility over the incident, while the police department would claim that the officer involved in the incident was off-duty at the time and was hired by the school.Student wants school administrators and police to be held responsible for classmates suicide WPMT FOX43Geneva High School community remembers quarterback Hayden Long - newsnet5.com ClevelandOhio high school student killed himself after being accused of smelling like marijuana News Student The IndependentOhio teen commits suicide after school staffers accused him of smelling like pot at homecoming dance, friend says: ‚ÄòHe was directly told that he had ruined his life‚Äô - NY Daily NewsOhio high school officials under scrutiny after student‚Äôs suicide FusionStudent's death spurs controversy over homecoming dance actions - Star Beacon:Local News References External links * Geneva High School official web site * Geneva Area City School District official web site * Geneva High School principal Doug Wetherholt's official Twitter account Category:Educational institutions established in 1924 Category:High schools in Ashtabula County, Ohio Category:Public high schools in Ohio Category:1924 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Geneva High School (Ohio)"},{"id":"4530945","text":"This electoral calendar 2008 lists the national/federal direct elections held in 2008 in the de jure and de facto sovereign states and their dependent territories.

The book was released on 1 February 2010 (Australia). The description reads \\"Arthur Penhaligon must complete his quest to save the Kingdom he is heir to... and Arthur's world.\\"Amazon.com The book was the number 14 top selling book in Australia during its launch week.Facebook.com The book was released in Australia on 1 February 2010, the U.K. on 4 March 2010, and the U.S. on 16 March 2010. The characters Lord Sunday is the first son of The Old One and The Architect. He wields the seventh Key, and rules The Incomparable Gardens. He has ultimate authority in the House, but tends to leave the charge of the day-to-day affairs to his next-in-command, Superior Saturday, who has sought to prevent the implementation of the Architect's Will. One of the Seven Trustees, Lord Sunday defied the Seventh Part of the Will of his mother and, along with six other Trustees, keeping his demesne and Key for himself rather than yielding it to a human heir, believing that the transition of the Architect's powers and authority to a mortal to be inappropriate. He reveals that he only defied the Architect so that he could keep on tending to his Garden. Each of the Trustees is afflicted with a deadly sin. Six of the seven have been portrayed, leaving only pride for Lord Sunday. The Incomparable Gardens It is revealed in Superior Saturday that even if all the realms of the House were to be destroyed by Nothing, except the Incomparable Gardens, the universe will still exist and will not be destroyed as Arthur previously believed. Arthur believed that the entire House was created before the universe and that its partial destruction would thus cause the Secondary Realms to cease to exist. This is incorrect as The Incomparable Gardens alone were in fact the first thing the Architect created from Nothing; the Secondary Realms were created secondly, followed closely by the other Demesnes of the House for the purpose of study and documentation. This therefore makes the Incomparable Gardens the most important part of the House, and indeed, the epicentre of all creation. The Incomparable Gardens are 'defended' by a variety of bug-like creatures (believed to be Nithlings), mostly giant worms, beetles, and similar. The Gardens' supporting Drasil Trees, which are situated in the four corners of the Upper House, are also defended by beetle-shaped Nithlings. Past attempts to invade have failed due to these creatures, and Superior Saturday's attempts to build a tower tall enough to reach Sunday failed due to the Drasil trees' growth. However, she was able to slow them down by destroying segments of the house with Nothing. Thus, she was able to launch her invasion. The Nothing, however, has continued unabated, and threatens to destroy the House. Lord Sunday's defining Deadly Sin is Pride, for he is confident in his power. Plot Falling from the Incomparable Gardens in Superior Saturday, Arthur, having won the Sixth Key, escapes impalement on Saturday's Tower by entering the Improbable Stair. His uncontrollable falling leads the Stair to spit him out somewhere completely unexpected - he is under attack from sentient insects somewhere in the Secondary Realms, and is unable to concentrate to use the Fifth Key to escape. Meanwhile, Arthur's friend Suzy Turquoise Blue plots to escape from her prison in Saturday's Tower while battle rages above and below her. Saturday's forces are pressing into the Incomparable Gardens, but are also engaged in a fierce struggle to keep the Piper and his army of Newniths at the bottom of the Upper House. Suzy is being held captive by the intelligent but forgetful Giac, a Sorcerous Supernumerary (meaning he failed his final sorcery exams). She, with some help from the sixth part of the Will, persuades Giac to free her and accompany her to the Citadel in the Incomparable Gardens. On Earth, Leaf, responsible for the Sleepers from Lady Friday, struggles to cope with the aftermath of a nuclear strike and desperately needs help, especially since she herself has become a target for intruders from the House, namely Lord Sunday's Dusk and his 'pet'. Within the House, Nothing continues to rise and must be stopped before it can destroy the entire House and Universe.HarperCollins.co.uk Sunday intends to hold Arthur to ransom by controlling Leaf and his mother; to this end, he dispatches the \\"Reaper\\" (Sunday's Dusk) to take Leaf through the Front Door. It is then revealed that the Door is filled with Nithlings and is collapsing through contamination by Nothing. The Lieutenant-Keeper of the Door is vanquished in battle with the Nithlings; the Reaper comes to his aid a few minutes too late, and the Keeper dies, handing over the post to an unwilling Leaf. As the new Lieutenant- Keeper, Leaf cannot be compelled to leave the Front Door, so the Reaper goes back to Lord Sunday to report his failure. Arthur returns from the unknown planet in the Secondary Realms by a supreme effort of will and control over the Improbable Stair, because his ear was shot off before he fully entered the Stair; once healed, he believes he has returned to his bedroom on Earth, but as he searches his house he finds his mother (who went missing during the events of \\"Lady Friday\\") in the living room. As he approaches her he realizes that she can't see him. It is later revealed that Arthur's mother is trapped in a time loop and is being displayed as an exhibit in the Incomparable Gardens. He cannot interact with her; when he looks out of the windows he can see nothing but green leaves draped against them. Soon after, a Piper's child (employed as a gardener) enters the house with a flaming pitchfork; Arthur grabs and deactivates it, then forces the boy to lead him out of the house. The boy professes not to have heard of the upheavals among the Trustees; he thinks Arthur is the Reaper (leading Arthur to suspect that the Reaper is Sunday's Dawn, Noon or Dusk). As they leave Arthur's house, they are ambushed by Sunday's Dawn and Noon, and the Piper's child reveals himself to be Lord Sunday in disguise. After chaining Arthur up by his arms to a colossal dragonfly, (the form of transport commonly used in the Gardens) they fly him over the Gardens to a smaller replica of the clock face to which the Old One is bound. Arthur, his Keys overcome by the superior power of the Seventh Key, tries to escape by using his own innate powers to form something out of Nothing. He fails to create anything, but he brings his childhood toy, Elephant, to life. He sets it to search for his confiscated Keys; meanwhile, he calls the Mariner to come and rescue him. Hours later, the Keys are sent to him and Arthur is able to free himself. Leaf has ventured to the Middle House via portal and has joined forces with Suzy's band of motley Raiders. They attempt to infiltrate the Upper House in order to prepare elevators for the Army of the Architect to get through to the Gardens. Fred Initial Numbers Gold accidentally picks up Leaf's sword during an attack by the Piper's army and receives the post of Lieutenant-Keeper of the Front Door. Arthur battles with Lord Sunday, who also has to contend with an invasion by the combined forces of the Piper and the now-subservient Saturday. The battle is taken to the Elysium, the epicenter of creation; it is here that the seventh part of the Will (a withered apple tree) is kept in a gilt cage. The Mariner opens it at Arthur's behest, but is killed in the process. The freed Will traps Sunday while Arthur claims the Seventh Key (in the form of a small key). When Dame Primus bites into an apple from the manifestation of Part Seven of the Will, the Will is made whole; Arthur unknowingly becomes its channel for its intended purpose - the destruction of the House. The Old One is freed, and He steps into the Will; it is explained that the Architect split Herself in two at the beginning of Creation to speed the evolutionary process The Old One is in fact a part of Her, but he had to be chained up when his views grew distinct from Hers, and the manifestation of the Will is the Architect in Her entirety. She reveals that, bored with life, She wished to return to Nothing to see what it was like to die. She could not do so, however, without destroying the House, because in her anger She had chained the Old One to the fate of the House, and the Old One was anchoring her to existence. The Architect destroys the remnants of Creation with the powers of the Keys. The now omnipotent Arthur survives and is anointed \\"New Architect\\" by the fading thoughts of the Architect, who needed a mortal Heir to provide a creative spirit to renew the Universe. Arthur decides to remake the Universe exactly as it was, using the Compleat Atlas of the House to provide the template. Although the Atlas holds a record of the House and Realms a few seconds before the destruction, Arthur is unable to save his mother, but he does split himself into the New Architect and the human Arthur before his transformation into a denizen of the house. The new human Arthur is not quite the same, being immune to all disease and retaining all the knowledge he acquired on his journey. The New Architect sends Arthur and Leaf back to Earth by recreating the Seven Dials. In the new Creation of the Universe, Suzy reveals her desire to be the new Lady Sunday, and pressures the New Architect to remake the House. The New Architect reveals he will soon bring back Doctor Scamandros, Fred, and Giac, the sorcerer, who could all help with the creation of new Denizens.Allenandundwin.com References  External links  Garthnix.com *7 Category:Novels by Garth Nix Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:2010 fantasy novels ","title":"Lord Sunday"},{"id":"4530968","text":"Mayo is a British television detective fiction-cum-comedy series, adapted from the Gil Mayo Mysteries series books by Marjorie Eccles, first broadcast on BBC One on 12 March 2006.https://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/mayo/ The eight-part series, produced by BBC Birmingham, starred Alistair McGowan as the titular character, alongside Jessica Oyelowo, Huw Rhys and Louise Brealey.

It is a thrush-sized species weighing about 37 g. The silky-flycatchers are related to waxwings, and like that group have soft silky plumage. The habitat of this bird is mountain forests, where the breeding pair builds a neat cup of lichen 2 to 18 m above ground in a tree, sometimes in loose colonies. The female lays two brown and lilac- blotched grey eggs, which are incubated by both adults. The young fledge 18 to 25 days after hatching, and are fed by both parents. The male long-tailed silky-flycatcher is 24 cm long and has a pale grey forehead. The rest of the crested head, neck, throat and lower belly are yellow. The back, lower breast and upper belly are blue-grey, and the flight feathers and long pointed tail are black. The outer tail feathers are spotted with white. The female is 21 cm long and generally duller than the male, with a darker grey forehead, olive body plumage and a shorter, duller black tail. Immatures are similar to the adults, but the central tail feathers are shorter and the white spotting on the outer tail is indistinct. This species forages in small flocks when not breeding, flycatching for insects or taking small fruits, especially mistletoe. Long-tailed silky-flycatchers often perch prominently on high exposed twigs. The call of the long-tailed silky-flycatcher is a repeated chee-chip. This species is a host to the biting louse Brueelia ptilogonis.

Life  Born in a family of the upper class bourgeoisie (English origin by the paternal grandmother). A year later he moved to the Alentejo. His father died early, in a car accident. In Sines he spends all his childhood and adolescence, until the family decides to send him to the art school Escola Ant√≥nio Arroio, in Lisbon. On April 14, 1967, a military refractory, he went to live in Belgium, where he studied painting at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Architecture et des Arts Visuels (La Cambre) in Brussels. After completing the course, he decides to quit painting in 1971 and dedicated himself exclusively to writing. During this period he lived in a community of hippy artists and, following a connection with a Belgian girl, would have fathered a child. Returns to Portugal on November 17, 1974 and writes the first book entirely in the Portuguese language, \\"√Ä Procura do Vento num Jardim d'Agosto\\". \\"O Medo\\", an anthology of his work from 1974 to 1986, is published for the first time in 1987. This became the most important work of his career and his definitive artistic testimony, being added in later editions new writings of the author, even after his death. He also left incomplete texts for an opera, for a photo book about Portugal and a \\"false autobiography,\\" as the author himself called it.

Formed under Baptist auspices, the school today lacks any sectarian affiliations. It is ranked number one in the field of the study of religion according to the National Research Council's measure of faculty quality in its survey of all doctoral granting programs in religious studies.\\"Doctoral Programs by the Numbers: Religion.\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education. The scholarly work of the School is organized through the work of three faculty committees, each of which is further subdivided into areas of study. PhD students concentrate their work in one of the eleven areas of study. Students in the various master's programs combine study in these areas with courses specific to their programs. All students are taught by the same faculty. History A distinguished Semiticist and a member of the Baptist clergy, Chicago's first university president William Rainey Harper believed that a great research university ought to have as one central occupation the scholarly study of religion, to prepare scholars for careers in teaching and research, and ministers for service to the church. He brought what was then the Baptist Theological Union Seminary to the University, making the Divinity School the first professional school at the University of Chicago. The Baptist Theological Union (BTU) originated as a department of the Old University of Chicago which had opened in 1856 but BTU became independent in the 1860s. The old university ceased operations in 1886, with the exception of its law school which was absorbed by Northwestern University. The Divinity School is located in Swift Hall, on the main quadrangle of the University's campus in close proximity to the Divisions of the Humanities and the Social Sciences for interdisciplinary work. Degrees The University of Chicago Divinity School grants Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Master of Arts (M.A.), and Master of Arts in Religious Studies (A.M.R.S.) degrees. It offers several dual-degree programs with other schools at the University of Chicago. Curriculum Candidates for the Ph.D. choose among 11 areas of academic focus: * Anthropology and Sociology of Religion * Bible * History of Christianity * History of Judaism * History of Religions * Islamic Studies * Philosophy of Religion * Religion, Literature, and Visual Culture * Religion in America * Religious Ethics * Theology The Faculty are organized into three Committees of Study: The Committee on Religion and the Human Sciences * History of Religions * Anthropology and Sociology of Religion * Religion, Literature, and Visual Culture The Committee on Historical Studies in Religion * History of Judaism * History of Christianity * Biblical Studies The Committee on Constructive Studies in Religion * Philosophy of Religion * Ethics * Theology Research and special programs The Martin Marty Center for the Advanced Study of Religion The vision of establishing an institute for the advanced study of religion at the University of Chicago came from Joseph M. Kitagawa, the Dean of the Divinity School from 1970 to 1980. Martin E. Marty, a historian of modern Christianity, worked closely with Dean Kitagawa to formulate the purposes and operation of the institute within the context of the Divinity School's general mission of teaching and graduate research. The Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion officially opened in October 1979, with Professor Marty as its director. Subsequent directors have been Bernard McGinn (1983‚Äì1992), a historian of medieval Christianity; Frank Reynolds (1992‚Äì2000), a historian of religions who specializes in Buddhist studies; W. Clark Gilpin (2001‚Äì2004), a historian of American Christianity and theology; Wendy Doniger (2004‚Äì2007), a historian of religion who specializes in Hinduism and mythology; and William Schweiker, who works in the field of theological ethics. In 1998, the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion was renamed the Martin Marty Center, to honor its founding director for his singular distinction as historian, author, and commentator on religion and public life. Buddhist Studies Program A number of faculty in the Divinity School and the humanities departments of South Asian Languages and Civilizations (SALC), East Asian Languages and Civilizations (EALC), History, and Art History participate in an interdisciplinary program in the study of the Buddhist Traditions. Degrees are offered through matriculation in one or the other of these programs. The program sponsors workshops and seminars throughout the academic year. Affiliated faculty include Daniel A. Arnold, Steven Collins, Paul Copp, Matthew Kapstein, James Ketelaar, Gary A. Tubb, and Christian K. Wedemeyer.  Awards and Prizes  Each year, the Divinity School awards prizes for specific student achievements. These include: the John Gray Rhind Award, to an advanced student in the ministry program at the Divinity School whose excellence in academic and professional training gives notable promise of a significant contribution to the life of the church, and the J. Coert Rylaarsdam Prize, to a student who has made special efforts, curricular or extracurricular, to promote interfaith relations, particularly between the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim traditions. Additionally, the School awards a prize for Frederick Buechner Award for Excellence in Writing. The School also awards the Divinity School Prize for Excellence in Teaching, to recognise the efforts of doctoral students in their teaching, and the Tikva Frymer-Kensky Memorial Prize, for a student who has written the most accomplished essay integrating the materials and insights of at least two of the fields to which Professor Frymer-Kensky‚Äôs own scholarship contributed: Hebrew Bible, biblical law, ancient Near Eastern studies, and ritual and/or feminist theology. Swift Hall Swift Hall Completed in 1926, Swift Hall was designed by Coolidge and Hodgdon in the collegiate Gothic style of architecture. It contains lecture halls, seminar rooms, faculty offices, a student-run coffee shop, a commons, and administrative offices. The lecture hall was formerly the home of the Divinity Library, before its holdings were consolidated into the central research library, the Joseph Regenstein Library. Bond Chapel Bond Chapel Southwest of Swift Hall and connected to it by a stone cloister is the Joseph Bond Chapel. Both Swift Hall and Bond Chapel were designed by the architects Coolidge and Hodgdon at the end of the Gothic revival period in America. The Chapel was given by Mrs. Joseph Bond in memory of her husband, a former Trustee of the Baptist Theological Union, the predecessor institution of the Divinity School. Mr. and Mrs. Bond's daughter, Elfleda, married Edgar J. Goodspeed, a member of the university faculty noted for his translation of the New Testament. After her death in 1949, Mr. Goodspeed donated the stained-glass windows in her memory. The cornerstone of the chapel was laid by Mrs. Bond on April 30, 1925, and the chapel was opened in October, 1926. In 2012-13, the Chapel was renovated and its organ was replaced by the Reneker Organ. Inspired by instruments built in northern Germany in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Reneker Organ was built by Canadian master organ builder Karl Wilhelm in 1983 for Graham Taylor Hall at the former home of the Chicago Theological Seminary. It was dedicated in 1984 in honor of the late Robert W. Reneker and Betty C. Reneker, and was moved to Bond Chapel in the autumn of 2012. The cloister connecting Bond Chapel to Swift Hall was reconstructed in 2014. A cloister garden is due to be installed between Swift and Bond in 2015. As a Divinity School chapel in a major university, its main function is to provide a sanctuary for reflection, worship, and community gatherings. It is used extensively for weddings, funerals, mid-week Divinity School worship services, other religious services, theater presentations, and musical events performed by the University's smaller musical groups, such as Collegium Musicum. It seats about 300 persons. Notable faculty and former faculty *Daniel A.

It is half way between Zushi and the old Japanese capital of Kamakura. It is on Sagami Bay and just over one hour by train from Tokyo. Location and scenery The little fishing village is backed by steep hills. On top of one is Osaki Park, famous for its cherry blossom viewing in late March or early April, from where one can view the whole surrounding area. Across Sagami Bay can be seen Mount Fuji immediately behind Enoshima Island. Yuigahama Beach runs the whole way from Kotsubo up to the outskirts of Kamakura. On a clear day Shimoda and Odawara are visible. The southern vista looks over the beach of Zushi and the ancient coast running down to Hayama and its Imperial Summer Palace. On the surrounding hills there are many small Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, some over a thousand years old. Most of the housing is also very old but there are two large modern housing developments, one of which is called Cosmos Milos, dominates one hill and is designed to look like an old Greek village. On the sea-front there is a large apartment complex with the well-known yachting port of Zushi Marina. Activities and facilities The village has fish markets from where many of the local sushi shops buy their daily supply of tuna and other fresh catches. The area has now become popular as a retirement resort and has an abundance of small specialist hospitals and clinics, many restaurants and exercise facilities. Transport Kotsubo is easily accessed by bus from either Kamakura or Zushi. It normally takes about 15 minutes. Taxis from both places take about 10 minutes, except in July and August when sometimes travel can take an hour because beaches are visited by thousands of people every day.

For the French translation, the Flemish engraver Jacob de Bie turned the prints from Ripa's original book into linear figures inside circular frames, thus turning Ripa's allegories into the reverse side of Roman coins.Olga Vassilieva-Codognet, √Ä la recherche des g√©n√©alogies effigionaires de princes: Series of Retrospective Dynastic Portraits and the Social Implications of True Likeness (Antwerp, ca. 1600), p. 102-105 The book was extremely influential in the 17th and 18th centuries and was quoted extensively in various art forms. In particular, it influenced the painter Pietro da Cortona and his followers. Also Dutch painters like Gerard de Lairesse, Willem van Mieris based work on Ripa's emblems. Vermeer used the emblem for the muse Clio for his The Art of Painting, and several others in his The Allegory of Faith. A large part of Vondel's work cannot be understood without this allegorical source, and ornamentation of the Amsterdam townhall by Artus Quellinus, a sculptor, is totally dependent on Ripa.Miedema, H. (1987) Beeldespraeck: register op D.P. Pers' uitgave van Cesare Ripa's Iconologia (1644), p. III. An English translation appeared in 1709 by Pierce Tempest. The baroque painter Antonio Cavallucci drew inspiration for his painting Origin of Music from the book. In 1779, the Scottish architect George Richardson's Iconology; or a Collection of Emblematical Figures; containing four hundred and twenty-four remarkable subjects, moral and instructive; in which are displayed the beauty of Virtue and deformity of Vice was published in London. The drawings were by William Hamilton. In 1819, Filippo Pitrucci, a London-based artist, published his version of Iconologia.

History Consisting of three batteries ‚Äì the 131st STA, 132nd UAV and CSS Bty ‚Äì the regiment draws on the lineage of the 20th Locating Regiment, which was disbanded in 1971; the 131st Divisional Locating Battery served with the 1st Australian Task Force during the Vietnam War, having originally been formed in 1954 as a Citizens Military Force (CMF) unit before becoming a regular unit in 1965. The 131st was deployed to Vietnam between 1966 and 1941. The 132nd Locating Battery was also formed as part of the CMF around the same time. The 131st STA Battery was transferred to the regiment in 2006, and while the remainder of the regiment began forming in 2007. The regiment is responsible for providing the Australian Army with artillery spotting and tactical reconnaissance. The regiment is based at Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera, Queensland. All elements of the regiment were formed over the course of several years after 2007. The 132nd UAV Battery was to operate the Army's Israel Aircraft Industries I-View UAVs from 2010, but the acquisition of these UAVs was canceled in 2009. The regiment then operated Boeing ScanEagle UAVs, and deployed UAV detachments to Iraq and Afghanistan. The regiment has also deployed the AN/TPQ-36 Weapon Locating Radar to Iraq. On 1 March 2010, 20STA became part of the re-raised 6th Brigade. After the cancellation of the I-View, in August 2010 the AAI Shadow 200 was approved for purchase, with the first systems expected to be operating in Australian hands by the end of 2011. After training in the US, the regiment deployed a battery to Afghanistan in 2012, eventually rotating three batteries through this deployment. The Shadow is due for replacement around 2022. As well as deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq, the regiment has also deployed personnel to East Timor and the Solomon Islands.

The cathedral is the oldest continuously operating parish and the oldest stone building in California. It was built in 1791-94 making it the oldest (and smallest) serving cathedral in the United States, along with St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is the only existing presidio chapel in California and the only existing building in the original Monterey Presidio.  Early history  The church was founded by the Franciscan Saint Jun√≠pero Serra as the chapel of Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on June 3, 1770. Father Serra first established the original mission in Monterey at this location on June 3, 1770, near the native village of Tamo. However, Father Serra became engaged in a heated power struggle with Military Governor Pedro Fages, who was headquartered at the Presidio of Monterey and served as governor of Alta California between 1770 and 1774. Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first and religious outposts second. Serra decided to move the mission away from the Presidio, and in May, 1771, the Spanish viceroy approved Serra's petition to relocate the mission to its current location near the mouth of the Carmel River and the present-day town of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. When the mission was moved, the existing wood and adobe building became the San Jose Chapel for the Presidio of Monterey. Monterey became the capital of the Province of Californias in 1777 and the chapel was renamed the Royal Presidio Chapel. The original 1770-71 church along with other buildings in the presido was destroyed by fire caused by a salute gun in 1789 and was replaced by the present sandstone structure built between 1791 and 1795. It was completed in 1794 by Indian labor. In 1840, the chapel was rededicated to the patronage of Saint Charles Borromeo. In 1849, the chapel was selected to be the Pro- Cathedral of the Diocese of Monterey by Bishop Joseph Alemany. After Alemany became Archbishop of San Francisco, his successor Thaddeus Amat y Brusi moved the cathedral to Mission Santa Barbara, to be closer to the population in Los Angeles.  Hoover marriage  The cathedral sanctuary as seen on Holy Saturday in 2013. Future President of the United States Herbert Hoover and Lou Henry were married February 10, 1899 by Father Ramon Mestres who was serving at the chapel; Hoover was the first President to be married by a Catholic priest.Humes, James C. (2003). Which President Killed a Man?: Tantalizing Trivia and Fun Facts about Our Chief Executives and First Ladies, p. 172. McGraw Hill. The wedding took place not at the chapel, but in the Henry home. Father Mestres had received special dispensation from the bishop to perform the civil ceremony because there was no Protestant minister in town at the time.  Architecture  Statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe atop the cathedral fa√ßade. The Royal Presidio Chapel is the first stone building in California and reflects the exquisite Spanish Colonial style of the late 18th century. The Moorish architecture influence is also evident in the fine architecture. The ornamental arches and portals carved in sandstone make the church unique and arguably the most beautiful of all the Missions. A garden surrounds the gated Mission, with a path leading all the way round and to both San Carlos School and the Rectory of San Carlos Cathedral. To the right of the Cathedral lies a statue of the Virgin Mary with an arch beneath. At the rear of the building is the Junipero Oak, a California landmark. There is a bell tower to announce Mass and in the niche at the very top of the fa√ßade there is a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the oldest non-indigenous sculpture in the state.

Historic designation  In 1960, the chapel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places #NPS-66000216 as a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. The chapel again became the cathedral of the Diocese of Monterey when the Diocese of Monterey- Fresno was split in 1967 to form the Monterey and Fresno dioceses. The cathedral is the smallest in the contiguous United States, and one of the two oldest buildings serving as a cathedral in the United States (St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans, Louisiana was also completed in 1794).

It documented the history, current condition and action meeded to conserve the chapel.Conservation Needs Funding for restoration was provided by The Getty Foundation, The California Missions Foundation, The Walker Foundation, the Community Foundation of Monterey County, and private donations. In May 2007 a concrete apron that had prevented evaporation of moisture within the exterior walls was removed. To divert water away from the sandstone walls, a French drain was constructed around the entire perimeter of the building. The roof was removed to repair termite damage and to install the attic portion of the engineering retrofit. Workers removed the plaster covering the original stone walls. They found that the nave walls, built in 1794, were in much better condition than the transepts and apse which were added in 1858. About 80% of the southern-facing rear walls of the church were replaced with 100 tons of new stone and lime mortar. Seismic retrofit included tying the interior and exterior walls together. The exterior walls were reinforced by drilling vertical holes in the walls and inserting steel bars. Restorers also discovered that the interior of the church had been decorated much more richly than previously believed.

He is notable for being the only soldier from Rejimen Askar Wataniah to have been awarded the Panglima Gagah Berani. He first joined the army on 27 December 1976 at the age of 20 and was absorbed into 19 Platoon, D Company of 11 Rejimen Askar Wataniah. His unit's primary duty was to man roadblocks and guard the construction of the East-West Highway through the town of Gerik, Perak. On 15 August 1977, he was involved in a firefight which earned him the Panglima Gagah Berani. His unit of 5 soldiers (including himself) was given the duty of transporting rations to another military post. En route they discovered a dead monkey on the pathway that they were using. Upon inspection it was decided that the monkey had been slaughtered. After discounting the possibility of an ambush, the unit moved forward only to be mowed down by enemy fire. One Lance Corporal Ahmad Zaki was shot in the thigh, with Pvt Abdul Halim and Pvt Tajudin both badly wounded with shots to the chest. Pvt Ielias managed to jump clear and landed in a bush of thorns which lacerated his outer cornea. The enemy, numbering around 30, had effectively surrounded them and were armed with automatic rifles including M16's supplied by North Vietnam. Although they were in a position to destroy the unit, they chose to force the unit to surrender. One of the wounded soldiers, (either Pvt Halim or Tajudin) managed to get to his rifle and tried to continue the fight but the enemy effectively disabled him by wounding both of his arms and shoulders. Enemy fire continued to rain upon him until he smeared his face with his own blood. Lance Corporal Zaki, who was badly wounded, pleaded to his men to pull him to safety. He however, succumbed to his wounds as a result of blood loss. Although the unit was effectively down to only Pvt Ielias, he did not waver and found cover behind a mound of termites nests, which are extremely hard and known to be able to withstand direct fire. He brought his FN FAL into action, continuing the fight. The firefight lasted for about 7 hours, in which he fired only 5 shots, killing 3 enemies. Of his 5 shots, only one missed the target with one enemy being shot twice. Halted by the effective fire from Pvt Ielias, the enemy withdrew from the area once they detected military reinforcements arriving. As a result of his actions, he was conferred with the Panglima Gagah Berani on 29 August 1977 by Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Yahya Petra and with the Pingat Keberanian Handalan by Sultan Idris Al-Mutawakkil Alallahi Shah, the sultan of Perak, on 12 December 1977. By 1977, the threat from communist elements had subsided so his unit was disbanded and he was transferred to 9 Royal Ranger Regiment. He retired from the Army in 1998 as a Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM).

Plot  The player takes the role of a Magelord, named Eldon the Spellbinder. His task is to find the evil Magelord outcast Zorn, in the castle of Lorraine, and defeat him by use of the so-called Ultimate Spell.  Gameplay  The game is pseudo-3D, allowing the player to move left, right, forwards and backwards in a room, though not up and down. It was presented in a monochrome format, with black and one other colour being used to draw the sprites and backdrops, although the colour varied from room to room, illustrating the environments. A large number of items could be examined for clues, or searched for possible items. The game was relatively open-ended for a game of the time, similar to Exile, allowing the player to move around a large section of the castle right from the start, and start to mix various spells. A few of these spells were listed in the manual, but most had to be discovered from in-game clues. Unusually, for a BBC Micro game, it has continuous background music: a version of Midnight Summer Dream, the 1983 song from British rock group The Stranglers' album Feline.  Development  The game was written by Dan and Etan Shirron, two teenagers from Israel. They were 14¬Ω and 16 when they started coding the game in 1986. The equipment used to write it was a memory monitor chip, a monochrome 14\\" TV, a cassette tape recorder and their own BASIC-written graphic-design software.

It is centred on the town of Ponte Leccia, from which three main lines radiate to Ajaccio, Bastia, and Calvi. The section following the northwest coastline between L'√éle-Rousse and Calvi, known as the Balagne line, gives access to many beaches and is very popular with tourists. A fourth line, running from Casamozza (on the Bastia line) down the east coast of the island to Porto-Vecchio was badly damaged by bombardment during World War II and never reopened. History Gustave Eiffel's viaduct at Vecchio In 1877 it was decided to build a metre-gauge railway in Corsica, despite the very difficult terrain it would have to cross. Legislation was passed on 4 August 1879 for the construction of the railway. The first lines opened on 1 August 1888 between Bastia and Corte and also between Ajaccio and Bocognano. The network was gradually opened in sections until 1894. A line to Porto-Vecchio opened in stages, the final section opening in 1935, but this was to be short lived owing to the war. There were proposals to build lines from Ajaccio to Propriano and also from Porto Vecchio to Bonifacio, but these lines were not built. In 1955, there was a proposal to close the Calvi ‚Äì Ponte-Leccia line; and in 1959 another proposal to close the whole network, which was successfully opposed by the railway workers and the citizens of Corsica. In 1972, another proposal for closure was fought off.  Network  Route map With a length of , the network is composed of two lines, both single track: * Ajaccio‚ÄìBastia via Ponte-Leccia and Corte, . * Calvi- Ponte Leccia via L'√éle-Rousse . A third line of , opened between 1888 and 1935, serving the east coast; it linked Casamozza to Porto-Vecchio. After suffering much damage during World War II in September 1943, it was never restored, although the section between Casamozza and Folleli remained open until 1953. The track of the disused line, between Casamozza and Moriani, at , is being considered for reopening. Vizzavona station.L'√éle-Rousse station.The island's geography and topography has forced the line to follow it. The network has 32 tunnels and 51 bridges and viaducts. The longest tunnel, at , is near Vizzavona. This tunnel, at high, is also the highest on the network. The viaduct at Vecchio, long and high, was designed by Gustave Eiffel. The CFC is the only metre gauge line in France carrying freight. One train a day operates over the Ajaccio-Bastia line. In winter, the Vizzavona pass is often blocked, and closed to road traffic. Most of the goods wagons are today used for track maintenance purposes. Stations Ownership Renault AHB8 railcar with Billard trailerThe network is owned by the government of France and not by R√©seau Ferr√© de France. The Collectivit√© Territoriale de Corse, CTC, is the concessionary holder of the network, under the act of parliament on regionalisation of railways in France, and is the transport authority and regulator of railway services. The CTC has entrusted the SNCF with the operation of rail services since 1 January 1983. A nine-year agreement between these bodies under the Loi Sapin came into effect on 1 September 2001. A modernisation plan agreed by the national government, the CTC and the SNCF envisages the investment of 110 million euros. These funds are to be allocated to the modernisation of rolling stock and infrastructure, thus reducing travel time. An extension of the network towards the airports at Bastia and Ajaccio is also envisaged. Rolling stock Current rolling stock Services are provided with sixteen multiple units and locomotives.

Policing has always been a responsibility of the German states even after 1871 when the country was unified. The 1919 constitution of the Weimar Republic did provide for the possibility of creating a national police force, should the necessity arise, but it was only in the Nazi era that state police forces were unified under central control and a national police force created (Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA). The police became a tool of the centralized state and the Nazi party. Following the defeat of 1945, Germany was divided; in 1949 the three western zones were turned into the West Germany , the Soviet zone became East Germany. Each country pursued a different path concerning law enforcement. In light of the gross misuse of power by the centralized Nazi state, the new West German constitution provided a strict separation of powers, placing law enforcement firmly in the hands of the states. The only policing agencies allowed at the federal level were the paramilitary Federal Border Guard (German: Bundesgrenzschutz), also responsible for coast guard services and the Federal Criminal Police, both under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Because Germany's borders became largely open since 2005, due to the development of the European Union and the Schengen Agreement to all neighbourhood countries, the Bundesgrenzschutz was renamed to Federal Police (German: Bundespolizei). The duties of the Federal Police still are limited to the security of railway lines, main railway stations, airports, sea ports, and several other special duties. East Germany created a centralized police force under the Ministry of the Interior, the paramilitary Volkspolizei (literally \\"People's Police\\"). It also established a border police force (German: Grenztruppen der DDR), initially an independent force, later integrated into the army and then reorganized as an independent military organization. Federal agencies Federal Criminal Investigation Office Bundeskriminalamt (BKA)-Badge Another central police agency, the Federal Criminal Police Office (German: Bundeskriminalamt / BKA), with approximately 3,000 agents, operates nationwide from headquarters in Wiesbaden. The BKA is a clearinghouse for criminal intelligence records. It provides assistance to the State Criminal Police Offices (German: Landeskriminalamt / LKA) in forensic matters, research, and criminal investigations. It is also the national point of contact for the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). The BKA enters cases only when requested by state authorities, or in cases involving two or more states. The BKA is involved in combating various terrorist gangs, which have plagued the country since the 1960s. Customs officer in Zoll-uniform Federal Customs Service The Federal Customs Service (German: Bundeszollverwaltung) is the executive and fiscal administrative agency of the Federal Ministry of Finance. It was founded in 1949 in West Germany. The purpose of the Customs Service is to administer federal taxes, execute demands for payment on behalf of the federal government and federal statutory corporations, monitor the cross border movements of goods with regard to compliance with bans and restrictions, and prevent illicit work. Uniformed federal agents are used for the execution of the financial legislation. Subordinated to the federal customs service, the Customs Investigation Bureau in Cologne (German: Zollkriminalamt / ZKA) coordinates customs investigations nationwide in particular monitoring foreign trade, uncovering violations of EU market regulations, illegal technology exports, subsidy fraud in the agricultural sector, drug trafficking and money laundering. In response to the increasing violence against law enforcement officers, the customs SWAT team, the Central Customs Support Group (German: Zentrale Unterst√ºtzungsgruppe Zoll / ZUZ) was implemented in 1997 as the customs tactical unit for dangerous missions. Federal Intelligence Service The Federal Intelligence Service (German: Bundesnachrichtendienst / BND) was based in Munich. Since February 2019 is the Service based in Berlin. The BND is restricted to the investigation of threats originating outside of Germany. It depends heavily on wiretapping and other surveillance techniques applied to international communications. Such activities are authorized only to counter the danger of an armed threat to the country, but intelligence authorities have pressed for the added power to monitor suspected international traffickers of weapons and drugs. Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution The (Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (German: Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz / BfV) primarily the domestic intelligence service of Germany, concerned with espionage, treason, and sedition. It has no powers of arrest and cannot use force, but it carries out surveillance and supplies the BKA and other police agencies with information on international crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, and other illegal activities. Its main office is in Cologne. Similar and independent offices exist in each state; although they cooperate closely with the federal office, they operate under the control of state authorities. Badge of the federal police Federal Police Established in 1951, the Bundespolizei (BPOL) is the uniformed federal police force. It is subordinated to the Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesministerium des Innern (BMI)).OSCE Entry on BPOL http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17#Country_Profile_Section_211 The Bundespolizei was previously known as the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS) (\\"Federal Border Guard\\") and had a more restricted role until July 1, 2005 when the law renaming the BGS as the BPOL was enacted. All personnel on duty wear sidearms. Some units have light aircraft and helicopters to facilitate rapid access to remote border areas and for patrol and rescue missions. A coast guard force forms a part of the BPOL. It is equipped with 14 large patrol craft and several helicopters. In addition to controlling Germany's border, the BPOL serves as a federal reserve force to deal with major disturbances and other emergencies beyond the scope of Land police. The BPOL guards airports and foreign embassies, and several highly trained detachments are available for special crisis situations requiring demolition equipment, helicopters, or combat vehicles. After shortcomings in police procedures and training were revealed by the terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics, a task force known as Border Guard Group 9 (GSG-9) was formed to deal with terrorist incidents, especially hostage situations. The GSG-9 won world attention when it rescued 86 passengers on a Lufthansa airliner hijacked to Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1977. A military rank structure similar to that of the Bundeswehr was replaced in the mid-1970s by civil service-type personnel grades. The service uniform was green but has been changed to blue. The West German Railway Police (Bahnpolizei), formerly an independent force, and the East German Transportpolizei were restructured under the BGS to form the Bundespolizei in 1990. State agencies State Criminal Investigation Office Doorplate of the Landeskriminalamt of the state of Lower Saxony The State Criminal Police Office (German: Landeskriminalamt / LKA), is an independent law enforcement agency in most German states, that is directly subordinated to the respective state ministry of the interior. The LKA supervises police operations aimed at preventing and investigating criminal offences and coordinates investigations of serious crime, involving more than one regional headquarter. They can take over investigative responsibility in cases of serious crime, e.g. drug trafficking, organized crime, environmental and white-collar crime or extremist and terrorist offences. Each Landeskriminalamt is also a modern central office for information, analyzing police intelligence from home and abroad and transmitting it to police stations. It collates data on criminal offences and offenders in crime statistics that are used as a basis for new strategies, policy decisions and legislative initiatives. It also analyzes certain offense areas, evaluates the police measures executed in each case, forecasts expected tendencies and describes events in annual reports. State Offices for the Protection of the Constitution The State Office for the Protection of the Constitution (German: Landesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz / lfV) in every single state, is the domestic intelligence service, concerned with espionage, treason, and sedition. Due to the negative experiences of abuseing power in Nazi-Germany, the domestic intelligence duties are not centralized and therefore maintained by the states. As the BfV, the LfV have no powers of arrest and cannot use force, but it carries out surveillance and supplies police agencies with information on opposition parties, international crime, drug trafficking, terrorism, and other illegal activities. State Police Forces Police cars in Hamburg (2006). The German states are responsible for managing the bulk of Germany's police forces.OSCE entry http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17#Country_Profile_Section_212 Each state has its own police force known as the State Police (German: Landespolizei). Each state promulgates a law which lays down the organisation and duties of its police (Landespolizeigesetz or Sicherheits- und Ordnungsgesetz). Although the state police forces are regulated by sixteen different legislatures and are, in fact, different police forces, there has been an increasing tendency toward standardization of police activities nationwide. Concerns about terrorism and the growth of organized crime have strengthened the movement to centralize police procedures and operations. The idea of creating one single police code for the whole of Germany (allgemeines Polizeigesetz) came up in the 1960s but never passed. These forces are organized by cities, towns, or rural communities, but all are integral components of the police forces of the state in which they are located. The respective state minister of interior supervises police operations in his or her jurisdiction. Although the internal organizations differ somewhat, all state police are divided into the Protective Police (German: Schutzpolizei / SchuPo), a uniformed service carrying out routine law and order duties, and Criminal Police Office (German: Kriminalpolizei / almost always abbreviated with KriPo), who carry out criminal investigations. The separate Administrative Police formerly had duties that included the registration of residents and the issuance of passports, identity cards, and various permits. These functions have been transferred to civil state government departments (Einwohnermeldeamt‚ÄîResident registration office) in all states. The uniforms and vehicle colour schemes of the state police forces are different, but somewhat similar all over Germany, the state police forces are structured differently in each state as well. For example, in some states the Kripo can be part of the ordinary police force, in some states it is organized separately. The idea of using the same colour for police uniforms and vehicles throughout the European Union has been realized in all German state police forces and the federal police. All vehicle liveries and uniforms changed from white/green to silver/blue until 2018. The basic silver colour for vehicles in the most states, is actually increasing the resale value and thus lowers leasing costs. The uniforms already have been changed by all state police forces and the federal police from the green/beige version introduced in 1979 to blue ones. Hamburg was the first state to make the transition, Bavaria the last state, finishing the replacement of the green/beige uniforms in 2018.  Auxiliary State Police Forces  Some German states maintain auxiliary police forces under different denominations, depending on the state's legislation. In the most auxiliary forces, the officers are armed with pepper spray, in some forces with the regular equipment of professional police officers. Following states maintain a \\"Voluntary Police Service\\" (German: Freiwilliger Polizeidienst) like Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Hesse, some a \\"Security Watch\\" (German: Sicherheitswacht), like Bavaria and Saxony, and only Brandenburg offers a \\"Security Partner\\" (German: Sicherheitspartner) program. Their main duty is crime prevention by: * conducting walking patrols to deter street crime * patrolling near schools and kindergartens * maintaining contact with potential victims of crime and juvenile delinquents. Bavaria has instituted a system of citizen patrols (Sicherheitswacht) in which unarmed teams of two volunteers patrol assigned areas to improve subjective security. These teams carry a radio to call for help if necessary and a pepper spray for protection. A white armband with black letters identifying them as a \\"Security Watch\\" patrol. Citizens in Baden-W√ºrttemberg can participate in the volunteer police programme, where roughly 1,200 citizens voluntarily assist their local police in 20 towns. These volunteers are specially trained, wear regular uniforms and are sworn and armed with normal police gear. Citizens in Hesse and Saxony can also participate in a Volunteer Police program, where some citizens voluntarily assist their local police. The volunteers are trained for 50 hours in Hesse and 60 hours in Saxony, receive uniforms, pepper spray and a mobile phone in Hesse and a radio in Saxony. In Brandenburg there were established about 200 security partners along the Polish border as well as around Greater Berlin. The legal basis is a decree of the State Minister of the Interior of 11 October 1995. People can also join on a full-time basis the Wachpolizei, which has less authority (and less pay) than regular police officers to perform basic police tasks, like the guarding of premisses like an embassy, to release regular officers for patrol work. Local agencies  Municipal order enforcement agencies Patrol car of the Ordnungsamt of the city of Fulda In Germany municipal code enforcement is organized very heterogeneously, depending on state, county and municipal regulations. Currently, many cities in Germany maintain local order enforcement agencies, with limited police-type duties. Those bylaw enforcement officers in general are city employees. Contingent on the respective unit, the officers wear - usually police like - uniforms or wear plain clothes with an armband or a labeled jacket, they could be armed or unarmed. The order enforcement officers are the municipal administration's \\"eyes and ears on the street\\". Mostly they are charged with monitoring municipal by-laws and laws that fall under the responsibility of municipalities, which include monitoring the conduct of shop owners, sanitation inspections, veterinary inspections and minor infractions and misdemeanors such as illegal parking, littering, state and local dog regulations etc. They usually only hand out warnings and fines and can only perform a citizen's arrest as any other citizen can. If they see any major crimes they are required to call the state police. Even the denominations are manifold, depending on local regulations as well, most of the time the denominations are: * Municipal Code Enforcement Service (German: Gemeindevollzugsdienst / GVD) * Community Enforcement Service (German: Kommunaler Ordnungsdienst / KOD) * Order Enforcement Office (German: Ordnungsamt / OA), most common denomination * Municipal Enforcement Service (St√§dtischer Ordnungsdienst)  Municipal police forces In Baden- W√ºrttemberg municipal police officers do have the same rights, powers and obligations like the counterparts of the state police. The tasks of a municipal police force depend on the size of the municipality's territory and the number of inhabitants in which it is operating. The \\"police authority\\" (German: Polizeibeh√∂rde) of a town or city can transfer more tasks and responsibilities to its police force, only if approved by the regional government of the state(German: Regierungspr√§sidium). Car of the Stadtpolizei in Frankfurt In the state of Hesse, city police forces provide the local order enforcement. The officers wear police uniforms and are armed. Similar to the municipal order enforcement units, there are different denominations: * City Police (German: Stadtpolizei) * Community Police (German: Kommunalpolizei) Training Police training is primarily the responsibility of the individual states, although the federal government provides assistance and coordination. The high level of police professionalism is attributed in large degree to the length and thoroughness of training. The situation is different in the five new states of eastern Germany. Long accustomed to a society made compliant by eliminating opposing opinions, police forces of the eastern states have to adapt to the growing numbers of opposing right-wing groups and factions. Most police recruits spend about two and a half years in the regular police academy training (Mittlerer Polizeivollzugsdienst). The auxiliary police forces, with fewer powers and often not equipped with a duty-weapon, are trained in just 12 weeks. In case of higher education (Abitur), recruits can also start off at a higher rank, comparable to Lieutenant (Rank: Polizei-/Kriminalkommissar), which they have to attend police college for and acquire a bachelor's degree. After about six years of duty as a patrol officer, an individual with an outstanding record who does well on a highly competitive examination and started off in the regular police academy (mittlerer Polizeivollzugsdienst) can go on to two or three years at a higher police school or a college of public administration to qualify for this bachelor's degree (Aufstieg in den gehobenen Polizeivollzugsdienst). The very few candidates who qualify for the highest ranks of the police study for one year at the Federal Police Leadership Academy in M√ºnster-Hiltrup. Off duty carry Depending on the certain state police regulation, German police officers may be authorized to carry their department-issued firearms while off duty. Some states allow their officers to apply for the approval to purchase a private firearm, that can be carried off-duty. Further restrictions that forbid off-duty carry exist (i.e. when drinking alcohol, at public events). In their private properties, the officers are required to have a safe to store their gun while not carrying it.Personal Knowledge Women in the Police The state police forces have had female members since the implementation of the several police forces after World War II. Initially, female officers were assigned to cases involving juveniles and women, working in plainclothes without weapons. Since the mid-1970s, female police officers have performed general police patrol duties and their proportion of total police officers is steadily rising. However, their representation in leadership positions is still relatively low. Alert Police The Alert Police (German: Bereitschaftspolizei / BePo), literally \\"Readiness or Standby Police\\" is available in each state for riot control, although their primary function is training police recruits. Beside this, the Federal Police maintains a Bereitschaftspolizei as well, to assist the state police forces if necessary. While the states are free to choose the equipment and to organize their police forces autonomously, the state and federal alert police units receive standardized weapons, vehicles, anti-riot gears and communications equipment from the federal government by law. An office in the Federal Ministry of Interior monitors and coordinates the deployment of the BePo units, which can be called upon to assist the police of other states in case of riots or other civil unrests. The Alert Police is assigned to barracks where they are organized along military lines into squads, platoons, and 120- to 150-member training or standby companies. In most states, the BePo contingents consists of one 600- to 800-member battalion, but in six of the larger states they are organized into regiments. Duties vary according to local requirements. In Hamburg, for example, the BePo patrol the subway system, assist in police raids in the red-light district, and are present at large demonstrations and soccer matches. Their units are equipped with their own transport, tents, and rations, enabling them to be shifted quickly to other L√§nder without having to rely on outside support. The Readiness Police have water cannons and armoured vehicles but are armed with lighter weapons than those of the federal police. All state alert police forces and the federal alert police force maintain specialized units as well, the so-called Arrest Units (German: Beweissicherungs- und Festnahmeeinheiten, lit. \\"Units for arrests and securing evidence\\", abbreviated BFE). The BFE units were established in 1987 after two police officers have been killed during demonstrations against the expansion of Frankfurt Airport. As a reaction to several terrorist attacks in Europe since 2015, an additional unit, the BFE+, was implemented in summer 2015. The BFE+ should provide specialized operators for long lasting (search) operations for example after a terrorist attack. Career brackets In general, the German law enforcement authorities of today have personnel of three available career brackets, the lowest being the \\"Mittlerer Dienst\\" (\\"middle service\\"), followed by the so-called \\"gehobener Dienst\\" (\\"elevated service\\") and the \\"H√∂herer Dienst\\" (\\"higher service\\"). Only the Federal Customs Administration (Bundeszollverwaltung) and the Departments of Justice and Corrections of the states (Justizvollzugsdienst‚ÄîJustice Enforcement Service) still have personnel of the very lowest career bracket \\"Einfacher Dienst\\" (\\"simple service\\"). To understand this structure it may be helpful to compare it with military rank structures because decades ago it was really similar. Einfacher Dienst = Soldiers, mittlerer Dienst = NCOs, gehobener Dienst = COs, h√∂herer Dienst = Staff Officers (Major and up). Development of career brackets Today nine of sixteen State Police Forces recruit only for the career bracket of the \\"gehobener Dienst\\". Entry into \\"Mittlerer Dienst\\" requires successful completion of 10 years of schooling, or a successful training in any other job and some years of working in this job. Period of training is 2 years at the police academy starting with the rank of Polizeimeister-Anw√§rter. The highest possible rank in this bracket is that of Polizeihauptmeister mit Zulage. In the mid to late seventies the \\"mittlerer Dienst\\" was disestablished for the detective branch Kriminalpolizei, but in some states of the former GDR, they still exist. Rank designation, in this case, f.e. Kriminalhauptmeister. Entry into the \\"gehobener Dienst\\" requires a high-school diploma and period of training is 3 years at a college of administration and justice. The highest possible rank in this career is that of Erster Polizei-/Kriminal-hauptkommissar. The third career bracket is the so-called \\"h√∂herer Dienst\\". A direct entry into this career bracket is possible and requires a law degree of a university, but the majority of these officers had started their career in \\"mittlerer\\" or \\"gehobener Dienst\\". Period of training is 2 years at the Deutsche Hochschule der Polizei or German Police University. That is the only official centralised educational institution of the German police. Starting at the rank of \\"Polizeirat\\"or \\"Kriminalrat\\" (literally \\"police counsellor\\" or \\"detective counsellor\\") up to \\"Polizeipr√§sident\\" (\\"police president\\"), which is (in most German states) equivalent to the rank of Chief of Police in the USA. Judiciary The German legal system is a civil law mostly based on a comprehensive compendium of statutes, as compared to the common law systems. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court, being located in the city of Karlsruhe) is the German supreme court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtsh√∂fe des Bundes (\\"Supreme Federal Courts of Justice\\"), is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice (\\"Bundesgerichtshof\\" in Karlsruhe) and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court (\\"Bundesarbeitsgericht\\" in Erfurt), the Federal Social Court (\\"Bundessozialgericht\\" in Kassel), the Federal Finance Court (\\"Bundesfinanzhof\\" in Munich) and the Federal Administrative Court (\\"Bundesverwaltungsgericht\\" in Leipzig). The V√∂lkerstrafgesetzbuch (International Penal Law Code) regulates the consequences of crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, and gives German courts universal jurisdiction under specific circumstances. Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the Strafgesetzbuch (literally Penal Law Book) and the B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch (literally Civil Law Book) respectively. The German penal system is aimed towards rehabilitation of the criminal and the protection of the general public. Except for petty crimes, which are tried before a single professional judge, and serious political crimes, all charges are tried before mixed tribunals on which lay judges (Sch√∂ffen or assessors) sit side by side with professional judges. Equipment Vehicles An Opel patrol car of the Hesse State Police wearing the silver/blue livery (including the reflective strips) Sonderwagen 5 of the Saxony State Police Mercedes Benz police van in Berlin, nicknamed \\"Wanne\\" (\\"Bathtub\\") in outdated green livery Federal Police patrol car German police typically use cars from German manufacturers. Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Audi, Opel and BMW are commonly used as patrol cars (Streifenwagen). States used to prefer vehicles built in or close to the respective state. However, with most states now leasing instead of buying their vehicles and in light of European Union rules on contract bidding, states have less latitude in choosing which manufacturer will provide their patrol cars than they did. In the Saarland which is historically closely tied to neighboring France, vehicles from French companies as well as European Fords are used as police cars. The Bavarian State Police uses mainly BMW and Audi vehicles, as both companies are based in Bavaria (BMW in Munich and Audi in Ingolstadt). In the eastern states of Germany, mostly Volkswagens are in use (Volkswagen is based in Wolfsburg, close to the eastern states). The Hessian police prefer Opel cars (General Motors-brand Opel is based in R√ºsselsheim near Frankfurt am Main in Hesse). Baden-W√ºrttemberg mostly uses Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars for their police force. Before the police reform in the mid-1970s, Germany had many city police forces and each had its own police car livery. Dark blue, dark green and white were popular colours. However, the dark colours were perceived as a disadvantage as many accidents occurred at night during high-speed chases. Therefore, the conference of interior ministers decided on standardising police car liveries so that the cars appeared non-threatening and could be easily visible at night. Bright green and white became the colours associated with police vehicles in Germany beginning in the 1970s. More recently, police forces changed to silver cars and vans instead of white ones as they were easier to sell than the white ones when their police service was over. Now, most states have light blue instead of green stripes, but cars painted in the old livery can still be seen (as of November 2012). Only the states of Bavaria and Saarland have opted to retain the green-on-white/silver livery; all other states are transitioning to blue-on-white/silver. Today, German police forces generally lease patrol cars from a manufacturer, usually for a period of three years. The leasing company marks the patrol cars using plastic foils with reflecting strips as borders instead of painting them. The foils are removed when the cars are sold to the public as standard silver used cars when the lease runs out. Unlike in other countries like the United States, police cars in Germany rarely come with any special equipment (apart from the obvious, like flashing lights or sirens) not available to other users of the same model, as the cars on sale in European markets are generally considered to be fit for police duty without any further alteration.

From 1945 onwards, German police forces wore completely different coloured uniforms. From the mid-seventies, the police of all West German states and West Berlin wore the same green and beige uniform, most parts designed by Heinz Oestergaard. The standard uniform consisted of a tunic, parka, pullover without shroud, coat, visor cap and necktie in moss-green, trouser, pullover and cardigan in brown-beige, shirt (long and short sleeve) in bamboo-yellow. Shoes, boots, holsters, leather jackets and other leather gear were black. Leather gloves were olive-drab. There were some exceptions. Visor caps with a white top were worn by the traffic police and by the Schutzpolizei during traffic regulation duties. The state river or water police forces (German: Wasserschutzpolizei) wore uniforms of a completely different design. The basic uniformg was navy-blue, the shirt was white and the visor cap had a white top. The BGS wore an all forest green uniform with a bamboo-yellow shirt. After German Reunification the Volkspolizei was broken up into Landespolizei and switched to the standard uniform. During the period of transition, they still wore their old uniforms but with western style sleeve and cap ensigns. Because most European countries have blue police uniforms, all German states and the Federal Police have shifted to new dark blue uniforms to conform with the common blue image of the most police forces in Europe. In line with the uniforms, police vehicles and various items of equipment also changed colour from green to blue.

He was an Indy car pit crew member and drove in the USAC midget series in the 1970s. Miller is best known for being a writer at The Indianapolis Star from 1968‚Äì2001. He has also written for Autoweek, Car and Driver, ESPN and Speed. He currently is a correspondent and senior writer for Racer magazine and website, while also reporting on IndyCar broadcasts for the NBC Sports Network. Racing career Miller first visited the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1957, and attended his first Indianapolis 500 in 1959. In 1968, at the age of 18, he got to \\"stooge\\" for his driving hero Jim Hurtubise at Indy. Miller was hired for free to do odd jobs with the pit crew, but was fired before the end of the month after he ruined the paint job on Hurtubise's car. Miller become friends with chief mechanic Bill Finley, and driver Art Pollard. From 1971‚Äì78 (concurrent to his work with The Star), Miller began working on pit crews at the Indianapolis 500. It was common during that time for racing teams to hire extra freelance help for the Indy 500 due to the extended (month-long) work commitment. He was assigned to various jobs, such as the pit board and vent man, but never worked mechanically on the cars. Finley, one of the last true chief mechanics at Indianapolis, described Miller as \\"without a mechanical bone in his body.\\" In 1972, he bought his first race car, from Andy Granatelli. He raced a Formula Ford in 1972, and then bought a midget car in 1974 from Gary Bettenhausen. He then competed in USAC midgets from 1975‚Äì83. Miller's best race came in 1980 when he qualified 5th out of 93 cars for the annual \\"Hut 100\\" at the Terre Haute Action Track, a dirt race that featured 33 starters in 11 rows of three like Indy and also sported several top Indy drivers of the time. He considers that race the highlight of his career, however, he blew his engine and dropped out. After about ten years, he quit driving due to his lack of mechanical knowledge, and massive debts. Media career The Indianapolis Star Miller was hired at The Indianapolis Star in 1968. His first duties included answering telephones in the sports department. A year later, he was moved into the sports department as a writer. One of his early assignments was a traveling reporter following the Indiana Pacers. During his career, he became a polarizing figure. In 1981, he gained attention when he accused A. J. Foyt of cheating, for which Foyt punched Miller, and the paper issued a retraction. Miller also stirred up controversy, taking on Bobby Knight, the Irsay family, girls' basketball, and female golfers. One of his heated columns led to the girls' basketball team from Franklin College challenge the paper's sports department to a match, and the sportswriters won the game. Miller worked for 33 years at The Indianapolis Star, becoming one of the nation's best known sports writers for Indy car racing. He started covering the Indianapolis 500 in 1969. During the month of May for the Indy 500, in addition to his daily columns, Miller would have side gigs on WNAP-FM, WIBC, WTHR, and The Bob & Tom Show. In the early 1990s, he also served as emcee of the popular Last Row Party. Miller also wrote and reported occasionally about NASCAR, including extensive coverage of the Brickyard 400. Following the 1996 open wheel split, Miller was highly critical of the Indy Racing League and Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George. For this, he drew considerable ire from many locals and from various city leaders, but likewise gained a considerable following from CART supporters. However, he typically stopped short of directly criticizing most of the actual IRL drivers and crew members, explaining that most were hard- working and passionate about their sport, and merely intermixed in a political situation that was largely out of their control. He lost his radio show on WIBC and television job at Channel 13 for his anti-George stance. Eventually, after the department reorganized, Miller's duties shifted from columnist to focus solely on auto racing. In January 2001, Miller was fired from the Star. The reasons given for his release were violations of the company's e-mail policy as well as the ethics policy. He reportedly sent abusive e-mails to readers, sent pornographic material to co-workers, and sent defamatory e-mails about local community leaders (namely Tony George and Colts officials). He also was charged with accepting $2,500 from Kenny Br√§ck for work on his web site (Miller claims he never received the money), and being paid to write promotional material for CART, which violated company policy. Miller filed a grievance over the dismissal, however, it was dismissed. An outside arbitrator ruled that the firing was justified due to \\"gross misconduct\\" on the job. Miller contended that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George conspired to have him fired, due to his ongoing bad press about the IRL, and that behind the scenes, the Speedway would accept The Star as a business partner only if Miller was fired. Subsequent jobs Miller worked as a racing writer/reporter at ESPN from 2001-2004. he appeared on programs such as RPM 2Night and SportsCentury. During that time, he also wrote freelance for Champ Car's website. He was fired in March 2007 from Champ Car after he wrote a critical column that was perceived as undue criticism. The series eventually collapsed and merged with the IRL. In 2004, Miller joined Speed as a writer and Indy Car \\"insider.\\" He became a regular contributor to SpeedTV.com, SPEED Center, and WindTunnel with Dave Despain. He remained at the position until Speed's conversion to Fox Sports 1 in 2013. With many trusted sources throughout the paddock, Miller has broken several big stories regarding IndyCar racing and the Indy 500, including the 2008 IRL/CCWS unification. Versus / NBC Sports Network Starting in 2011, Miller has served as an analyst for IndyCar coverage on Versus/NBC Sports Network. His duties include pre-race interviews and commentary. At the 2011 Iowa Corn 250, he helped start the popular \\"grid walk\\" feature.Iowa Corn Indy 250 Recap Personal He graduated from Southport High School in Indianapolis and flunked out of Ball State University \\"after two very enjoyable quarters.\\" He also spent one semester at IUPUI. His first car was a 1962 Ford Galaxie. He has never married, does not drink and currently resides in Indianapolis. Miller claims he has lost over $250,000 gambling. The worst moment in his career was when he lost his friend Art Pollard during practice for the Indy 500 in 1973.

The term was introduced by Malcolm Ross in his study of Western Oceanic languages . It is contrasted with a family, which arises when the proto-language speech community separates into groups that remain isolated from each other and do not form a network.\\"I use the term family to refer to a group of communalects which have diversified from a single language by separation, rather than by dialect differentiation\\" . Principle Linkages are formed when languages emerged historically from the diversification of an earlier dialect continuum. Its members may have diverged despite sharing subsequent innovations, or such dialects may have come into contact and so converged. In any dialect continuum, innovations are shared between neighbouring dialects in intersecting patterns. The patterns of intersecting innovations continue to be evident as the dialect continuum turns into a linkage. According to the comparative method, a group of languages that exclusively shares a set of innovations constitutes a \\"(genealogical) subgroup\\". A linkage is thus usually characterised by the presence of intersecting subgroups.See . The tree model does not allow for the existence of intersecting subgroups and so is ill- suited to represent linkages, which are better approached using the wave model.See .See Lynch, Ross & Crowley (2002):92‚Äì93). The cladistic approach underlying the tree model requires the common ancestor of each subgroup to be discontiguous from other related languages and unable to share any innovation with them after their \\"separation\\". That assumption is absent from Ross and Fran√ßois's approach to linkages. Their genealogical subgroups also have languages descended from a common ancestor, as defined by a set of exclusively-shared innovations), but whose common ancestor may not have been discretely separated from its neighbours. For example, a chain of dialects {A B C D E F} may undergo a number of linguistic innovations, some affecting {BCD}, others {CDE}, still others {DEF}. Insofar as each set of dialects was mutually intelligible at the time of the innovations, all can be seen as forming separate languages. Among them, Proto-BCD will be the language ancestral to the subgroup BCD, Proto-CDE the language ancestral to CDE and so on. As for the language descended from dialect D, it will belong simultaneously to three \\"intersecting subgroups\\" (BCD, CDE and DEF). In both the tree and the linkage approaches, genealogical subgroups are strictly defined by their shared inheritance from a common ancestor. Simply, although trees entail that all proto-languages must be discretely separated, the linkage model avoids that assumption. Fran√ßois also claims that a tree can be considered a special case of a linkage in which all subgroups happen to be nested and temporally ordered from broadest to narrowest. In order to unravel the genealogical structure of linkages, Kalyan and Fran√ßois have designed a dedicated quantitative method, named Historical glottometry.Fran√ßois (2014).Kalyan & Fran√ßois (2018). Examples An example of a linkage is the one formed by the Central Malayo-Polynesian languages of the Banda Sea (a sea in the South Moluccas in Indonesia). The Central‚ÄìEastern Malayo-Polynesian languages are commonly divided into two branches, Central Malayo-Polynesian and Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, each having certain defining features that unify them and distinguish them from the other. However, whereas Proto-Eastern and Proto-Central‚ÄìEastern Malayo-Polynesian can be reconstructed (the sibling and the parent of Central Malayo-Polynesian, respectively), a Proto-Central Malayo-Polynesian language reconstruction, distinct from Proto-Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian does not seem feasible. It may be that the branches of Central Malayo-Polynesian are each as old as Eastern Malayo-Polynesian but that they went on to exchange features that are now considered to define them as a family. The features common to Eastern Malayo-Polynesian can be assumed to have been present in a single ancestral language, but that is not the case for Central Malayo-Polynesian. This scenario does not amount to a denial of a common ancestry of the Central Malayo-Polynesian languages. It is only a reinterpretation of the age of the relationship to be just as old as their relationship to Eastern Malayo-Polynesian. Fran√ßois (2014, p. 171) suggests that most of the world's language families are really linkages that are made up of intersecting, not nested, subgroups. He cites the Oceanic languages of northern Vanuatu as well as those of Fiji and of Polynesia and at least some sections of the Pama-Nyungan, Athabaskan, Semitic, Sinitic, and Indo-European families. Within Indo-European, Indo-Aryan, Western Romance and Germanic, in turn, form linkages of their own.

External threats According to former German Defense Minister Peter Struck, Germany does not face a conventional threat to its territory. In his own words, ‚ÄúAt present, and in the foreseeable future, a conventional threat to the German territory is not recognizable.‚Äù Internal threats At the end of 2004, Germany‚Äôs Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution identified 24 Islamist organizations operating in Germany that pose a security risk or promote extremism. Members and followers of these organizations total approximately 31,800, about 1 percent of Muslims living in Germany. The Turkish organization Islamic Society Mill√Æ G√∂r√º≈ü has the largest following, numbering 26,500. However, only a small hard core of fanatics is considered to be capable of terrorism. The primary targets are believed to be American, British, Israeli, and Jewish facilities, although the facilities of other nations also are endangered. Potential targets include embassies, consulates, nuclear power plants, dams, airports, sewage plants, subways, skyscrapers, sports stadiums, and churches, according to the former interior minister. The fact that Germany refused to participate in 2003 invasion of Iraq may mitigate the risk of terrorism by extremist Islamic groups somewhat. However, German authorities are not complacent. Germany also faces an internal threat from right-wing and left-wing extremists. At the end of 2004, there were 168 right-wing extremist organizations with 40,700 members, according to the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Neo-Nazis totaled about 3,800. A hard core of right-wing extremists capable of violence is estimated at about 10,000. Three political parties are associated with right- wing extremism: the Republicans, the German People's Union, and the National Democratic Party of Germany. The far-right German People‚Äôs Union holds six seats in the Brandenburg state parliament and one seat in the B√ºrgerschaft of Bremen. At the end of 2004, the far left, which has revolutionary Marxist and anarchist factions, had about 30,800 adherents. Only about 1,000 out of 65,800 members of the Party of Democratic Socialism support a communist platform. Approximately 5,500 far-left extremists are deemed to be capable of violence. Terrorism Following al Qaeda‚Äôs September 11, 2001, terrorist attack against the United States, Germans were surprised to learn that the mastermind of the strike and several accomplices previously had been living in Hamburg. Since then, Germany has been a reliable partner in the United States-led War on Terrorism, according to the U.S. Department of State. German courts have a very high standard of proof, which has made it difficult for authorities to convict or deport terrorist suspects. In February 2003, a Hamburg court convicted Mounir el Motassadeq of aiding and abetting the conspiracy and sentenced him to the maximum available term of 15 years. However, in March 2004, the German supreme court overturned this conviction, which was the first in the world related to the 9/11 incident, for lack of evidence and remanded the case for retrial. Finally, in August 2005, a Hamburg court re-convicted el Motassadeq and sentenced him to a seven-year prison term. In another case, years of procedural maneuvers were required before the German judicial system finally succeeded in October 2004 in deporting an Islamic extremist, the so- called ‚ÄúCaliph of Cologne,‚Äù to Turkey. In yet another case, in July 2005 a Syrian-German terrorist suspect was released from custody after the German supreme court ruled that he could not be extradited to Spain under a European Union arrest warrant because this step would violate Germany‚Äôs Basic Law. In August 2006, the German government disclosed a botched plot to bomb two German trains. The attack was to occur in July 2006 and involved a 21-year-old Lebanese man, identified only as Youssef Mohammed E. H. Prosecutors said Youssef and another man left suitcases stuffed with crude propane-gas bombs on the trains. The explosives failed to detonate because of a \\"technical defect,\\" according to the German federal prosecutor. If they had, the police said, a \\"high number\\" of passengers would have been killed. Prosecutors said it was likely the would-be bombers were not acting alone and may have been motivated by anger over the war in Lebanon, in which the German government has agreed to play a limited, peacekeeping role. Prosecutors also said Lebanon‚Äôs military intelligence agency had offered German authorities \\"decisive\\" information that led to Yousef's arrest.

They must also destroy alien spacecraft and targets on the scrolling landscape to obtain a set number of points before proceeding to the enemy headquarters and destroying that to move on to the next level. The game vertically scrolls, with the player being able to change direction at any time, but not change speed. The landscape loops with the player being able to reach the bottom by travelling up far enough, and vice versa. The game is incredibly fast and smooth scrolling (particularly for the Acorn Electron which lacks hardware scrolling ability), and the author once stated that he designed Syncron as an exercise in pure speed rather than playability.Micro User magazine, January 1989 The levels feature tall buildings that need to be avoided. As the scrolling is so fast, the player must learn the layout of the level to avoid these hazards.

Towards the top of the hill, it splits into three peaks of altitude , and . It offers beautiful views of Tai Tam Reservoir Group and Wong Nai Chung Reservoir. The hill is well preserved, with little construction on the hill. A rare and protected species, Hong Kong iris (Iris speculatrix) with violet flower can be found on the hill. Summit of Violet Hill Geography The hill is situated in mid-southern Hong Kong Island. Apart from the shore of Deep Water Bay and Repulse Bay in its southwest, the hill is surrounded by valleys with other hills on the island. With Mount Nicholson in its northwest, it forms a crossroad of Wong Nai Chung Gap where Wong Nai Chung Reservoir is sited. With Mount Butler in its northeast and Jardine's Lookout north, a valley leads to Tai Tam Reservoir in its east, an important water supply construction in the early colonial history of Hong Kong. Another mountain pass Tsin Shui Wan Au () forms with The Twins and Cheung Lin Shan allows one runs from Tai Tam Intermediate Reservoir to the Repulse Bay. History During World War II, the hill was part of the hostilities near Wong Nai Chung Gap during the Battle of Hong Kong and was used by Japanese forces with field guns to shell Aberdeen. Hiking Violet Hill is a part of the first stage of the Wilson Trail from Stanley. The trail first passes The Twins, then to Violet Hill.

Military career Apollon Dashkov participated in the Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774: in 1771 Dashkov took part in the march from the Taganrog fortress to Crimean peninsula to the Yenikale Strait fortress, which was soon taken by the Russian detachment commanded by Prince , later in 1772 and 1774 in marches against Crimean Tatars. For a few times he secured positions of quartermaster, and in 1782 and 1783 Dashkov was in Crimea, and later in the army of frontier division as captain. After the annexing of Crimea, he attended the triumphant present oath of citizenship to Russia by Tatars at the Karasu-bazar. In 1786 Dashkov became lieutenant colonel. That year he was appointed in infantry and two years later transferred to Kiev‚Äôs Grenadier regiment, and took part in the second Turkish war. Mayor-general and commander of the Kiev grenadier regiment since 1797; later - chef of Nasheburg musketeer regiment; commander of the Moscow garrison regiment in December 1797- April 1798; commander of the Elisavetgrad garrison regiment in 1798 and commander of Kherson garrison regiment in 1799‚Äì1800. Career of politician In 1801 Dashkov received the post of tsar's representative in the Black Sea Fleet chancellery. On October 8, 1802, tsar Alexander I of Russia appointed Apollon Dashkov as the first governor-general of Taganrog, where he was charged with reconstruction of the fortress. During Dashkov's governorship (1802‚Äì1805) were built several fortress buildings: infirmary, officers headquarters and barracks; improved the equipment of the municipal fire-brigade. In 1805, Dashkov was assigned to 6th department of the Senate. He died on September 2, 1808 (Old Style).

The Catlins Ranges take their name from the name given to this part of the country - the Catlins. The ranges lie mostly in Otago, although their western extremes lie in Southland Region. The original land purchaser was whaling captain Edward Cattlin (sometimes spelt Catlin). He purchased an extensive block of land along Catlins River on 15 February 1840 from KƒÅi Tahu chief Hone Tuhawaiki (also known as \\"Bloody Jack\\") for muskets and ¬£30 (roughly NZ$3000 in 2005 dollars). However, New Zealand's land commissioners declined to endorse the purchase. There are four distinct ranges: the small Rata and Beresford Ranges in the northeast, the Maclennan Range in the southwest, and the Forest Range, which can be considered as an extension of the Maclennan Range. Each of these ranges is oriented along a northwest-southeast axis. The ranges are separated by the valleys of the Catlins and Tahakopa Rivers. Inland, close to the watersheds of these rivers, the boundaries between the ranges become indistinct, part of the reason why they are often grouped together under the one name. The Maclennan Range is the largest of the ranges in terms of length, being some 25 km (15 mi) in length, but most of the highest hills are found inland in the area where the ranges are not easily differentiated. The highest point in the Catlins Ranges is the 720 m (2361 ft) summit of Mt. Pye, which is located 25 km (40 mi) north-northeast of Waikawa. Other prominent peaks include Mt Rosebery (719 m; 2359 ft), Ajax Hill (698 m; 2290 ft), Catlins Cone (698 m; 2290 ft), and Mt Tautuku (691 m; 2266 ft).

Enterprise is located at the corner of Greene Street and 15th Street. Revitalization Enterprise Mill is one of the city's prime historic landmarks. In 1983, Graniteville Company shut down the facility and closed. During the mid and late 1980s, the city originally planned to demolish the aging building at the time, which lasted for 10 years, but city officials later wanted to redevelop the building. A major renovation took place in 1995 as part of the downtown redevelopment. The building remained vacant for another 3 years until in 1998, when developers re-purposed the building into offices and lofts. It is one of the perfect examples of redevelopment in a decaying urban area. History Enterprise Mill was developed by James L. Coleman in 1845 and the building opened in 1848 as a flour mill. Originally, Coleman wanted to build it on his plantation, but the city council of Augusta granted a fund to build a canal to supply power, which would ultimately be the creation of the Augusta Canal. Between 1872 and 1875, the Augusta Canal was enlarged and several industrialists came to the area to build facilities around the canal. Much of the original mill, built in grey granite brick, is still standing today, though the bulk of what is recognizable today as the Enterprise Mill was built in red brick in 1877. Like all the great mills of Augusta, it is built on the Augusta Canal. In 1923 the Graniteville Company acquired the mill and eventually added the large red sign bearing the company name atop the structure. The sign still stands today and is most noticeable at night when it glows bright red. Though for most of its existence the mill was used for various manufacturing ventures, in 1983 the mill ceased operations and closed its doors. For many years it was assumed that the structure would be demolished, but in the mid-1990s the Mill underwent a massive overhaul and was converted into apartments and retail and office spaces. The Enterprise Mill stands as today as an example of the revitalization of downtown Augusta that began in the 1990s.

They are famously known as La Movida (The Movement). These changes were even more striking when contrasted with the values and social practices that had prevailed in Spanish society during the Francoist regime, especially during the 1940s and the early 1950s. In essence, Spanish social values and attitudes were modernized at the same pace, and to the same degree, as the country's class structure, economic institutions, and political framework.Eric Solsten and Sandra W. Meditz (eds.) Social Values and Attitudes, U.S. Library of Congress Country Study on Spain, 1990, from research completed in December 1988. Under the rule of Francisco Franco, dominant Spanish social values were strongly conservative. Both public laws and church regulations enforced a set of social structures aimed at preserving the traditional role of the family, distant and formal relations between the sexes, and controls over expression in the press, film, and the mass media, as well as over many other important social institutions. By the 1960s, however, social values were changing faster than the law, inevitably creating tension between legal codes and reality. Even the church had begun to move away from its more conservative positions by the latter part of the decade. The government responded haltingly to these changes with some new cabinet appointments and with somewhat softer restrictions on the media. Yet underneath these superficial changes, Spanish society was experiencing wrenching changes as its people came increasingly into contact with the outside world. To some extent, these changes were due to the rural exodus that had uprooted hundreds of thousands of Spaniards and had brought them into new urban social settings. In the 1960s and the early 1970s, however, two other contacts were also important: the flow of European tourists to \\"sunny Spain\\" and the migration of Spain's workers to jobs in France, Switzerland, and West Germany. Contraception and abortion During the Francisco Franco years, the ban on the sale of contraceptives was complete and rigid at least in theory, even though the introduction of the combined oral contraceptive pill had brought contraception to at least half a million Spanish women by 1975. The ban on the sale of contraceptives was lifted in 1978, but no steps were taken to ensure that they were used safely or effectively. Schools offered no sex education courses, and family planning centers existed only where local authorities were willing to pay for them. The consequence of a loosening of sexual restraints, combined with a high level of ignorance about the technology that could be substituted in their place, was a rise in the number of unwanted pregnancies, which led to the second policy problem: abortion. Illegal abortions were fairly commonplace in Spain even under the dictatorship. A 1974 government report estimated that there were about 300,000 such abortions each year. Subsequently, the number rose to about 350,000 annually, which gave Spain one of the highest ratios of abortions to live births among advanced industrial countries. Abortion continued to be illegal in Spain until 1985, three years after the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol or PSOE) came to power on an electoral platform that promised a change. Even so, the law legalized abortions only in certain cases. In the Organic Law 9/1985, adopted on July 5, 1985, induced abortion was legalized in three cases: serious risk to physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, rape and malformations or defects, physical or mental, in the fetus. Eventually, abortion laws were further liberalized in 2010, to allow abortion on demand during the first trimester. (see Abortion in Spain). Role of women Perhaps the most significant change in Spanish social values, however, was the role of women in society, which, in turn, was related to the nature of the family. Spanish society, for centuries, had embraced a code of moral values that established stringent standards of sexual conduct for women (but not for men); restricted the opportunities for professional careers for women, but honored their role as wives and (most important) mothers; and prohibited divorce, contraception, and abortion, but permitted prostitution. After the return of democracy, the change in the status of women was dramatic. One significant indicator was the changing place of women in the work force. In the traditional Spanish world, women rarely entered the job market. By the late 1970s, however, 22 percent of the country's adult women, still somewhat fewer than in Italy and in Ireland, had entered the work force. By 1984 this figure had increased to 33 percent, a level not significantly different from Italy or the Netherlands. Women still made up less than one-third of the total labor force, however, and in some important sectors, such as banking, the figure was closer to one-tenth. A 1977 opinion poll revealed that when asked whether a woman's place was in the home only 22 percent of young people in Spain agreed, compared with 26 percent in Britain, 30 percent in Italy, and 37 percent in France. The principal barrier to women in the work place, however, was not public opinion, but rather such factors as a high unemployment rate and a lack of part-time jobs. In education, women were rapidly achieving parity with men, at least statistically. In 1983, approximately 46 percent of Spain's university enrollment was female, the thirty-first highest percentage in the world, and comparable to most other European countries. During Franco's years, Spanish law discriminated strongly against married women. Without her husband's approval, referred to as the permiso marital, a wife was prohibited from almost all economic activities, including employment, ownership of property, or even travel away from home. The law also provided for less stringent definitions of such crimes as adultery and desertion for husbands than it did for wives. Significant reforms of this system were begun shortly before Franco's death, and they have continued at a rapid pace since then. The permiso marital was abolished in 1975; laws against adultery were cancelled in 1978; and divorce was legalized in 1981. During the same year, the parts of the civil code that dealt with family finances were also reformed. During the Franco years, marriages had to be canonical (that is, performed under Roman Catholic law and regulations) if even one of the partners was Catholic, which meant effectively that all marriages in Spain had to be sanctioned by the church. Since the church prohibited divorce, a marriage could be dissolved only through the arduous procedure of annulment, which was available only after a lengthy series of administrative steps and was thus accessible only to the relatively wealthy and was only applicable if the marriage was invalid to begin with. These restrictions were probably one of the major reasons for a 1975 survey result showing that 71 percent of Spaniards favored legalizing divorce; however, because the government remained in the hands of conservatives until 1982, progress toward a divorce law was slow and full of conflict. In the summer of 1981, the Congress of Deputies (lower chamber of the Cortes Generales, or Spanish Parliament) finally approved a divorce law with the votes of about thirty Union of the Democratic Center (Union de Centro Democratico or UCD) deputies who defied the instructions of party conservatives. As a consequence, Spain had a divorce law that permitted the termination of a marriage in as little as two years following the legal separation of the partners. Still, it would be an exaggeration to say that the new divorce law opened a floodgate for the termination of marriages. Between the time the law went into effect at the beginning of September 1981, and the end of 1984, only slightly more than 69,000 couples had availed themselves of the option of ending their marriages, and the number declined in both 1983 and 1984. There were already more divorced people than this in Spain in 1981 before the law took effect. Despite these important gains, observers expected that the gaining of equal rights for women would be a lengthy struggle, waged on many different fronts. It was not until deciding a 1987 case, for example, that Spain's Supreme Court held that a rape victim need not prove that she had fought to defend herself in order to verify the truth of her allegation. Until that important court case, it was generally accepted that a female rape victim, unlike the victims of other crimes, had to show that she had put up \\"heroic resistance\\" in order to prove that she had not enticed the rapist or otherwise encouraged him to attack her. In recent years, the role of women has largely increased in Spain, especially in politics but also in the labor market and other public areas. New laws have officially eliminated all kinds of discrimination, and are even perceived by some as positive discrimination, but a conservative part of the society is still ingrained in the macho culture. Anyway, Spanish women are quickly approaching their European counterparts, and the younger generations perceive machismo as outdated. Currently, Spain has one of the lowest birth and fertility rates in the world, up to the point of heavily hampering the population replacement rates. One or two children families are pretty common, and the age of parents has been increasing. Sociopolitical and religious views Evolution of the popular vote in Spanish General Elections from the democratic transition until 2008. Voter turnout is usually high. After 36 years of theoconservative National- Catholic Francoism, Spanish society as a whole has consistently shown a secular, left-leaning trend. Over a period of 40 years of liberal democracy, the social democratic Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) spent 21 years in office, although the conservative People's Party (PP) has since then steadily grown and has recently governed for eight years. Large regions as Andalusia or Extremadura have had PSOE regional governments since democracy was re-established in the country. Ecosocialist-Eurocommunist United Left has traditionally been the distant fourth political force in Spain, and recently has further lost some of its presence and representation. As a result of the overexploitation of national symbols and references by the Francoist regime, patriotism is not ingrained in Spanish society. Nationalisms and regionalisms are strong in spite of the high decentralization of the Spanish state, especially in Catalonia and in the Basque country. While Roman Catholicism remains the largest nominal religion in Spain, most Spaniards - especially the younger ones ‚Äî choose to ignore the Catholic teachings in morals, politics or sexuality, and don't attend Mass regularly.Compare: Compare: Agnosticism and atheism enjoy social prestige, in accordance with general secularization trends in Western Europe. Other religions like Christian Protestantism or Islam are on the rise, but only linked to the increase of immigrant population from poor muslim or christian majority countries and the large acceptance of Evangelism among the Romani people. Culture wars are far more related to politics than to religion, and the huge lack of popularity of typically religion-related issues like creationism prevent them from being used in such conflicts. Revivalist efforts by the Roman Catholic Church and other creeds have not had any significant success outside their previous sphere of influence. According to the Eurobarometer 69 (2008), only 3% of Spaniards consider religion as one of their three most important values, while the European mean is 7%.

History Wiley started out as a guitarist in a handful of local independent projects, including Electric Deadhead, The Plan, Space Opera and Evil Agents. He was also a member of The Tubetracks during a brief period when he lived in British Columbia. His unique guitar style always contributed to the sound of the groups he worked with, most notably his adept skill at surf music, being heavily influenced by Dick Dale, among others. During his involvement in these groups, he did not do any vocal work, with the exception of a few songs from Space Opera, which mostly consisted of talking or yelling, but no actual singing. Solo In 2002, he released his first solo project, Bottom Dollar. Not only was it his first solo effort, but it was a fully professionally produced CD, as opposed to the low-tech cassettes produced by all of his previous projects. While the surf influence wasn't evident, his talents as a singer and songwriter were startling, after so many years of being known as primarily a lead guitarist rather than a frontman. Some media reviews drew a comparison to Tom Waits, but most fans seem to agree that, while some of the lyrics are similar to Waits' style, a closer comparison in lyric style would be Bob Dylan. Bottom Dollar gained much critical acclaim: Wiley won Definitely Not the Opera's Big Break Contest in 2002,Kelly, Jim (November‚ÄìDecember 2002). \\"Nathan Wiley\\", Canadian Musician 24 (6): 78. and then won awards from the East Coast Music Association and SOCAN. Tracks from the album received repeated airplay on CBC Radio. The video for the lead single \\"Bottom Dollar Baby\\" was played in rotation on the Canadian muic station MuchMoreMusic, and remained in their Top 40 for several weeks. The album was released through the indie-friendly group Sonic, and was eventually picked up for distribution by Warner Bros. Records. The follow-up High Low was released in 2004, also gaining similar awards and acclaim. As stated on Wiley's website, \\"Wiley has shared the stage with such artists as Steve Earle, Sarah Harmer, Blue Rodeo, Ron Sexsmith, Gord Downie, The Skydiggers, Dan Bern, Kathleen Edwards, Danny Michel, Crush and Sarah Slean.\\" Band His band consists of his uncles Dale DesRoches (drums) and Tom DesRoches (bass).

To qualify as power walking as opposed to jogging or running, at least one foot must be in contact with the ground at all times (see walking for a formal definition). History and Technique Power Walking was founded in the 1990s. In 1999, the Berlin Marathon included a Power Walking division. Power Walking is often confused with racewalking, as the two techniques are very similar. Power Walking technique: * The walker must walk straight * The walker must walk doing an alternating movement of feet and arms * The walker must walk with one foot in permanent contact with the ground * The leading leg must be bent * Each advancing foot strike must be heel to toe at all times * The walker must walk not doing an exaggerated swivel to the hip * The arms spread completely from the elbows and these move back Also, Power Walking has been recommended (for example, by Kenneth H. Cooper) as an alternative to jogging for a low-to- moderate exercise regime, for instance 60‚Äì80% of maximum heart rate (HRmax). At the upper range, walking and jogging are almost equally efficient, and the walking gait gives significantly less impact to the joints. When used in this way, an exaggerated arm swing is often used. Competitions and World Records In recent years there have also been Power Walking competitions. There are currently world records of Power Walking in 5 km, 10 km, Half Marathon, 30 km, Marathon, Multiday distances, etc. See also *Walking *Racewalking References ;Sources *Reeves, Steve.

Situated on the south shore of Tudyah Lake between the highway and the Pack River, Tudyah Lake Provincial Park offers lake and river oriented recreation activities, as well as a setting for camping and picnicking, all easily accessible to highway travellers and local residents. The rolling forest covered hills surrounding Tudyah Lake are characteristic of the Nechako Plateau natural landscape, and within the park, the shoreline and forested areas encourage nature appreciation. Use of the Pack River system as an early trading route adds historical interest and opportunities for interpretation in this park. Topography within this park varies only slightly with elevations ranging from approximately 686 m to 672 m at the lake. Hydrologic features include Tudyah Lake on the north park boundary, the Pack River and an arm of backwater on the west boundary, and Bear Creek near the eastern boundary. The park is located on the former site of the Melville Lodge as well as a now abandoned airstrip. This resort provided cabins, camping and boat launch facilities and was very popular with Prince George and Mackenzie residents. In 1974, BC Hydro purchased this property, located within the reservoir basin, because of the possible effect of the Williston Reservoir at maximum full pool flooding. Public demand for maintaining recreational opportunities of this area was so strong that BC Hydro contracted a caretaker to maintain the campground, picnic area and boat launch. During this time public pressure for park development at this site grew and following considerable negotiations, a Provincial Park was established in August, 1981. Tudyah Lake supports a recreational fishery with Rainbow Trout and Dolly Varden as the popular sport species. Bear Creek has been noted as an important spawning area for trout.

C.'s largest park, located in the Coast Range. History Tweedsmuir gained park status in 1938 as the earliest large park established under the BC Parks protected areas system. Tweedsmuir North Provincial Park and Protected Area was re-designated a park and protected area as the latter classification allows resource extraction and other economic activities not permitted in full park designations. Entiako Provincial Park and Protected Area is located on the south flank of the Nechako River watercourse. Geography The northern portion of the park is a wilderness area. Access is possible via boat, using Ootsa and Whitesail Lakes. The Park is between Burns Lake and Houston. BC Parks provides this explanation: \\"To get from Chikamin Bay on Whitesail Lake to St. Thomas Bay on Eutsuk Lake in Tweedsmuir Provincial Park, boaters are required to winch their boats over a 600 metre rail portage. Boats to about 7 metres in length can be portaged.\\" Two other common access points are recommended, and maps are provided on the BC Parks web site: Little Andrews Bay Provincial Park and Wistaria Provincial Park. Burns Lake, B.C. is considered to be the northern gateway for fly-in tours for sightseeing, hunting and fishing; these are offered by local outfitters in the town. Ecology The park is considered to be an almost pristine mountain wilderness. There are many kinds of large mammals in the park including grizzly bears, black bears, wolves, mountain lions, wolverines, boreal woodland caribou, moose, mountain goats and hoary marmots. The Tweedsmuir- Entiako woodland caribou herd numbered about 500 caribou in 1993. Their range extends to throughout northern Tweedsmuir Park in alpine and forested habitat in the summer and to the mouth of the Entiako River where the migrates in late winter. By the early 1990s the herd was already declining. Research was undertaken to manage the herd as logging activities were proposed in the area near their winter range. In southern and central B.C. most of the caribou herds \\"had significantly declined in numbers and in range.\\" By 1985 Stevenson and Hatler had designated the maintenance of Tweedsmuir-Entiako caribou winter range in the land management report as high priority.

Formerly part of Tweedsmuir Provincial Park which was originally 981,000 hectares in size. It was formed from the southern portion of that park, the northern portion being re-designated Tweedsmuir North Provincial Park and Protected Area in order to allow resource extraction in the park. History The park, or rather the original Tweedsmuir Provincial Park which included what is now Tweedsmuir North Provincial Park and Protected Area, was created in 1938 in the wake of a 1937 visit by floatplane and horseback to the Rainbow Range by John Buchan, Lord Tweedsmuir, who was then Governor-General of Canada.BC Parks Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park webpage, History section An article about the creation of the park, written by John Buchan's wife, The Lady Tweedsmuir of Elsfield, appears in the April 1938 issue of The National Geographic Magazine. Geography Tweedsmuir Park is located east of the Kitimat Ranges in the western interior of British Columbia. The park covers almost 1 million hectares and spans four regional districts: Bulkley-Nechako, Cariboo, Central Coast, and Mount Waddington. The park is home to Lonesome Lake, famed for homesteader and conservationist Ralph Edwards, who worked to preserve migration habitat there for the trumpeter swan. This park was affected by the Mountain Pine Beetle epidemic in British Columbia.  Climate  With such a vast area the climate varies throughout the park. However in the lower regions closer to the Bella Coola Valley the temperature is warmer with a higher annual level of rainfall. Around one fifth of their annual precipitation falls as snow. Further west as the altitude climbs the weather is generally more severe and the temperature changes throughout the summer and winter are drastic. On average ranging between the minus thirties mid winter, to the higher forties during high summer.  Access  The southern portion of the park is along Highway 20, approximately 400 kilometres west of Williams Lake. Access is also possible along the Discovery Coast Passage ferry and Inside Passage from Port Hardy on Vancouver Island on BC Ferries or by float plane from Nimpo Lake, Anahim Lake or Bella Coola.  Recreation  Hunlen falls located in Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park The park hosts opportunities for angling, hiking, horseback riding, camping (both front-country and backcountry), and canoeing. There are two vehicle-accessible campgrounds in the park. There are also four designated picnic areas within the park. There is limited vehicle-accessible winter camping as well. The Tweedsmuir Ski Club maintains a small ski hill within the boundaries of the park with a single handle tow and cross-country ski trails. Snowmobiling is also possible within the Rainbow Range. Wildlife viewing, specifically of grizzly bears and black bears is a focus of the park in the autumn along the Atnarko River.  Points of interest  The main corridor through the park, along the highway, is interpreted by a series of signs developed as a partnership between BC Parks and the Nuxalk Nation. Some of the main attractions in the park are as follows: Alexander MacKenzie Heritage Trail: A historic passage used by Local first nations to the region and early explores for trade and travel to the coast. The trail passes through the park, via Heckman Pass and Burnt Bridge Creek. Hunlen Falls: One of Canada's highest waterfalls for unbroken drop (259m). The falls can be accessed via float plane or foot. Rainbow Range: Volcano range where the unique minerals give the soil an array of colours.

The lake became known as \\"Tyee Lake\\", from the Chinook word, originally pronounced Die-yeeh, meaning \\"chief\\".

It is the 25th detective novel featuring curmudgeonly New York sleuth Nero Wolfe, as narrated by sidekick Archie Goodwin. The story was also collected in the omnibus volume Three Trumps (Viking 1973). The story concerns Wolfe being hired to investigate documents missing from a million-dollar prize contest for a perfume company, with the title a reference to the deadline for winning entries: postmarked before midnight on the specified date. The investigation leads to murder and more. Numerous major works of literature are mentioned as part of the contest. Four poetic riddles describing real and fictional women are given, and three of them are solved, two by Archie, and one by Wolfe. The fourth is never solved within the text. Plot summary Nero Wolfe is approached by corporate attorney Rudolf Hansen and his clients Oliver Buff, Vernon Assa and Patrick O'Garro, the chief executives of Manhattan advertising agency Lippert Buff Assa (LBA). The group want Wolfe to save them from embarrassment and ruin following the murder of Louis Dahlmann, an up-and-coming advertising executive with the firm. Dahlmann's wallet was also stolen, and inside were the final answers for a series of cryptic poetic riddles run as part of a promotional competition for Pour Amour, a brand of perfume designed by one of LBA's clients. The first prize of the competition is $500,000, and in a meeting with the final five contestants the night before his death Dahlmann had revealed that he kept the answers in his wallet, both of which lead the police to suspect one of the contestants. The executives, however, do not want Wolfe to investigate the murder but to find out who stole the wallet before the contest deadline‚Äîmidnight of the nineteenth of April, exactly one week later‚Äîin order to ensure the integrity of proceedings and restore their reputation. Despite tension between the advertising agency and Talbott Heery, owner of the company that produces Pour Amour, Wolfe agrees to their terms. Wolfe dispatches Archie Goodwin to secure a copy of the final riddles and their answers for Wolfe's reference, and proceeds to interview each of the contestants: Gertrude Frazee, the leader of an anti-cosmetics women's group who has been using her members to find the answers for the riddles to try and embarrass the cosmetics industry; Carol Wheelock, a housewife who wants the prize money to secure a better life for her family; Harold Rollins, a condescending academic who entered the competition as part of an intellectual exercise; Susan Tescher, a magazine editor who wants to do a profile on Wolfe himself; and Philip Younger, a retiree seeking to recover a fortune he lost during the Great Depression. Although skeptical that Wolfe is only investigating the theft and not the murder, Inspector Cramer shares what the police have learned about the case so far. Other than the financial motive, none of the contestants appears to have had any serious reason or opportunity to either murder Dahlmann or steal the answers, and much to Archie's concern Wolfe's investigation appears to lose energy and focus. As the deadline nears, the LBA executives begin to panic and lash out, resulting in a contradictory sequence where Wolfe is fired and then rehired within a span of minutes. When all seems lost, however, an anonymous source sends copies of the answers to each of the contestants, thus voiding the contest and saving LBA. Although Archie, the LBA executives and the police suspect Wolfe of doing so, he insists that he was not responsible, and begins to suspect one of the advertising executives of at least stealing the wallet, if not murdering Dahlmann. After the letters are sent, Vernon Assa approaches Wolfe and attempts to unilaterally dismiss him from the case, but Wolfe refuses. His suspicions aroused, Wolfe summons the major players to his office and claims he will reveal the identity of the thief, and in doing so provide the police with vital information to help them identify the murderer. Before he can do so, however, Vernon Assa is poisoned with cyanide surreptitiously slipped into his drink and dies on the floor of Wolfe's office. Dahlmann's wallet is found in his pocket, suggesting that he was the thief and murderer. Infuriated at the murder of someone who was enjoying his hospitality and skeptical of Assa's guilt, Wolfe determines to identify the true culprit. He, along with Archie and Saul Panzer, travels to the offices of LBA and inspects a display of products from their clients, discovering a bottle of cyanide that he suspects was used to murder Assa; this confirms in Wolfe's mind the guilt of one of the executives. Confronting Buff, O'Garro and Hansen, Wolfe lays out the facts of the case and accuses Buff of murdering both Dahlmann and Assa. Buff is the only man who had clear means and opportunity, and Wolfe speculates that he was driven to murder Dahlmann out of jealousy and fear over Dahlmann's skills eclipsing and threatening his position. Assa discovered the wallet that Buff stole from Dahlmann to cover his tracks, and Buff murdered him to silence him. When Buff tries to throw suspicion on O'Garro, O'Garro reveals that Wolfe is correct. Buff is convicted of murder, but the remaining LBA executives challenge Wolfe's fee, arguing that as the thief and murderer Buff presumably exposed himself when he sent out the letters containing the final answers. In response, Wolfe reveals in confidence that he will be adding onto his bill the price of a used typewriter that has been disposed of in the East River, implying that he was in fact responsible for sending out the letters and saving them from humiliation after all.

When Lady Ashton died in 1938, the estate was sold and Vinehall started its life as a country preparatory school, opening with six local children. The first headmaster was Robert Jacoby.http://www.vinehallschool.com/vinehall/history-of-vinehall/ Vinehall School History Page During the Second World War, the school was evacuated to Killerton Park in Devon along with a local girls‚Äô school. The school returned to Robertsbridge after the war and in 1946 was bought by Major Tom Stuart- Menteath and his wife Kitty. He ran the school until 1957, at which point it was handed down to his stepson, Richard Taylor and his wife Patricia. With the help of his assistant headmasters H.S. Bazire and Tom Gilbart, the school went from strength to strength. Several new buildings were added, including a new classroom block, science labs, theatre, and indoor swimming pool. Much of the school's culture dates from that period. Richard and Pat Taylor handed the school over to their son-in-law David Chaplin in 1977. He and their daughter Sally remained until 2002. In the recent past, the purpose-built pre-prep was added as was a theatre, sports hall and in 2000, the Millennium Library and classroom complex. In 2002, the Chaplins handed over the school to Mrs Julie Robinson, who was head until summer 2010. Richard Follett took over as headmaster, taking up post in January 2011. He left in Summer Term 2017, with the current headmaster being Joff Powis. In more recent years the school theatre has been refurbished and re-opened as the Chaplin Theatre in honour of David Chaplin, who became headmaster on Richard Taylor's retirement. In 2018 the school was ridiculed for an advertisement centred on the fact that the headmaster drove a Jaguar car.

It was founded by and remains affiliated with the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary. History Convent of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart on Oakland's Lake Merritt, 1884 The university was originally established as the Convent of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in 1868 by six members of the Sisters of the Holy Names, a teaching order from Quebec, Canada. They were invited to Oakland by Father Michael King, pastor of Saint Mary's Church to establish a school for girls and to provide means to train future teachers. The original site of the convent was on the shores of Lake Merritt. By 1908 the convent began to offer classes at a post-secondary level and was renamed the College of the Holy Names. In 1949 the college became one of the charter members of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).Holy Names University - HNU History The coeducation graduate division was formally established in 1955. Soon afterward in 1957, the original site was purchased by Henry J. Kaiser where he constructed the Kaiser Building, and the school moved to its present location in the Oakland Hills. In 1971, Holy Names became coeducational at the undergraduate level and was renamed Holy Names College. The Julia Morgan School for Girls held classes for its first two years, from 1999 through 2001, at Holy Names. The school took its present name on May 10, 2004 and became known as the \\"newest Catholic university in California.\\"Holy Names University's Founders' Day Campus Holy Names University is located on a wooded, sixty-acre site in the Oakland Hills about 2.5 miles southeast of the Montclair district. To the north of campus lies the neighborhood of Woodminster, and the City of Oakland's 500 acre Joaquin Miller Park. To the southeast, Holy Names' campus is flanked with the Crestmont neighborhood to the east, and the Redwood Heights neighborhood is to the west across the Warren Freeway. Redwood Regional Park, part of the East Bay Regional Park District, lies about 2.2 miles east on Redwood Road. Architecture San Francisco Bay Area architect Milton T. Pflueger, younger brother of the renowned architect Timothy L. Pflueger, designed the mid-century modern campus buildings, which were constructed from 1955-1958, and dedicated in 1957. Milton Pflueger designed many campus buildings at University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University, but Holy Names is the only complete campus he designed. The first buildings constructed included Michael and Maureen Hester Administration, the Paul J. Cushing Library, the Tobin Gymnasium, and McLean Chapel. The hillside location inspired a linear plan, with low-roofed buildings nestled along the slope. The site features panoramic views across the San Francisco Bay from San Jose on the San Francisco Peninsula to Mount Tamalpais on the Marin Peninsula. The Valley Center for the Performing Arts was constructed in 1994, in the former location of the tennis courts. It houses two separate theatres; large audiences up to 390 can be accommodated in the Regents‚Äô Theatre, while smaller groups use the Studio Theatre with movable seating for up to 125 participants. Academics McLean Chapel, Holy Names University HNU maintains small class sizes, with a student to faculty ratio of 13:1, and 90 percent of the faculty hold the highest degree in their fields. U.S. News & World Report ranked HNU as the most diverse university in the West in 2013. This same year, Holy Names University earned the highest diversity index score of all the colleges and universities included in the magazine‚Äôs multiple diversity rankings. The university offers nineteen undergraduate degree programs, and five adult degree completion programs. HNU also offers seven master's degree programs in addition to a teacher education program leading to a California teacher's credential. Graduate degrees offered include several business degree concentrations (MBA with concentrations in energy and environment, finance, management and leadership, marketing, or sports management), counseling psychology (MA), education (EdD and credentials), English (MA), music (MA), and nursing (MSN/MBA, MSN). The university added a Master of Arts in Forensic Psychology in 2006.Holy Names University Master of Arts in Forensic Psychology In 2014, HNU will offer a RN-MSN program. Library services The Paul J. Cushing Library is a two-story facility with a distinctive vaulted ceiling and exceptional daylight on the main level. Its architectural design mirrors the campus chapel. The library provides the Holy Names community a full suite of electronic and traditional books and journals, as well as a wide range of gadgets and devices faculty and staff can check out. Library team members offer instruction to every department. The library regularly offers special events such as art exhibits, book talks, film showings, and lunchtime piano recitals. A popular spot for studying, the library averages more than 6,000 walk-ins per month. HNU Athletics HNU Athletics was established in 1994 and is an integral part of the university, having positive impacts on hundreds of students in more than two decades; realizing success through intercollegiate competition, academic pursuits, and an emphasis on the full development of one‚Äôs potential. The Schools athletic program is sponsored by adidas. The Hawks compete in the Pacific West Conference which is the largest NCAA Division II conference in the Western region and second largest conference in the nation. The university offers 14 varsity athletic teams: * Women's Sports: Basketball, Cross Country, Golf, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Track & Field, and Volleyball. * Men's Sports: Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Golf, Soccer, Tennis, and Track & Field. Men's volleyball is offered as a club sport. Center for Social Justice and Civic Engagement The Center for Social Justice and Civic Engagement (CSJCE) includes Service-Learning and Community-Based Leadership (CBL) programs. The CSJCE offers numerous volunteer opportunities, service projects, and dialogues through its CBL initiatives. The Holy Names University Early Admit Program (HNUEAP) is offered through the Center. The CSJCE serves as an exemplary example of a strong partnership between academic and student affairs. Through its programs and services, the CSJCE promotes leadership development for social responsibility and cultural competence. Programs and services emphasize personal and social awareness, equity and equality, justice, diversity, service, community involvement, and social activism. Students are introduced to issues such as water rights, poverty, and education for the poor, all platforms pursued by the SNJMs. Alumni * Dame Lydia Dunn, Baroness Dunn, Member of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, DBE * Carol A.

He was the author of the Companion to British History. He was awarded an OBE (1966) and the King Haakon VII Medal of Freedom (1945). Background Charles Arnold-Baker was the son of Professor Baron Albrecht Werner von Blumenthal (10 August 1889, Staffelde, by Stettin, Prussia ‚Äì 28 March 1945, Marburg an der Lahn), of Gross Schloenwitz by Stolp, Pomerania, by his first wife, an English lady, Wilhelmine, n√©e Hainsworth (1883‚Äì1978), and stepson of Percival Richard Arnold-Baker. His parents divorced in 1921; his mother returned to England and remarried, 1923, Percy Arnold-Baker, (1875‚Äì1944), brother of Sir Frederick Arnold-Baker.) He was born in Moabit Hospital, Berlin, in 1918 and died in 2009,The Times 10 June 2009 (Obituary)The Times 10 June 2009 (Death Notices) having been received into the Roman Catholic Church on his deathbed. His ashes were interred, however, in the triforium of the Temple Church, London. Wolfgang Charles Werner was educated at Winchester College and Magdalen College, Oxford (BA History 1940). As World War II approached Charles and his brother Werner Gaunt (Richard) took British nationality, and adopted their stepfather's surname, witnessed by Deed poll, and abandoned the use of their first Christian names. War Upon the outbreak of war they both volunteered for the British Army. Charles's recruitment was deferred by the authorities to the following year to enable him to complete his degree. He joined the Buffs as a private soldier, but was promoted to corporal within 10 days and commissioned directly on 25 February 1941. He then commanded one of two platoons of the 70th Battalion which were guarding Chartwell during Churchill's recuperation from illness there for three months. Out of courtesy he was invited with the other officers to dine weekly with Churchill during this period. It is unclear whether the Prime minister realised he was a German. From there he was posted to the 9th Battalion on 4 August 1943, but on 14 December 1943 he joined MI6 where he was given the code-name Anderton and worked with the traitor Kim Philby, whom he disliked, and in whom he saw none of the supposed Philby charm. He was one of the first to voice suspicions about Philby. His brother Richard was also in MI6 and interrogated Rudolf Hess. Belgium Charles took part in the liberation of Belgium, where one of his first duties was to take over Breendonk Concentration Camp, a poignant experience for a German. He and his boss, Richard Gatty, were accidentally the first Allied soldiers in Antwerp, where Charles was billeted on the generous hospitality of the Baroness van der Gracht de Rommerswael, having got ahead of the advancing Canadians and arrived in the town while the Germans were still there. Aided by the competent Belgian Commissaire Bloch, Gatty and he then rounded up the entire German local network of 68 spies, an action for which the Brussels office of MI6, which was headed by Robert Barclay and included Malcolm Muggeridge, claimed the credit, provoking an angry written protest from Gatty to Barclay which said \\"our job is to tell lies to the enemy.\\" Norway Charles then took part in the liberation of Norway, where he captured the complete Gestapo archive which enabled him to arrest fugitive Nazis, including Karl Fritzsch, the Deputy Commandant of Auschwitz. In his 2007 memoirs, For He Is an Englishman, Memoirs of a Prussian Nobleman, Captain Baker recorded that as an MI6 officer in Oslo he arrested Fritzsch: \\"We picked up, for example, the deputy commandant of Auschwitz, a little runt of a man called Fritzsch whom we naturally put in the custody of a Jewish guard ‚Äì with strict instructions not to damage him, of course.\\" He also arrested senior German military figures (King Haakon VII's Medal of Freedom). He took the view that as the war was now practically over, it was important to gather as much intelligence about the Soviet army, since this was plainly the new threat. In this he was thwarted, and his reports concerning his interrogations of such figures as a high civilian official in the German administration of occupied Russia, von der Ow, who described the anti-communist feelings of much of the population of the western USSR,Arnold- Baker, Charles,2007, For He is an Englishman, Jeremy Mills Publishing p. 259 were buried by his superiors who were, as it later emerged, Soviet spies. It seems that as a consequence he voiced suspicions about Philby which were later conveyed by M. Oldfield to Washington. Civilian career Arnold-Baker was called to the Bar in 1948, and practised in the Admiralty Division until 1952 in the chambers of J. Roland Adams Q.C., a former colleague from MI6. He received the Gwylim Gibbons Award from Nuffield College, Oxford, in 1959. After leaving the Admiralty Division he accepted a post as Secretary of the National Association of Parish Councils. He transformed this body into the union of all rural local councils in England and Wales, the National Association of Local Councils, (NALC), and he endeavoured to strengthen local customs and government on a small scale against the growth of larger local government blocs. In 1966 he was awarded the OBE for this work. He served as a member of the European Committee of the International Union of Local Authorities 1966‚Äì1978, and was a Delegate to the European Local Government Assembly at Strasbourg 1960‚Äì78. In 1978 he left the NALC to pursue an academic career as a Professor of Arts administration at the City University, London, where he lectured in Law and architecture, a subject on which he had no formal training. Nevertheless, his lectures were always packed. In 1966 he commenced writing The Companion to British History. The work was originally commissioned by the Oxford University Press, but after several disagreements with editors he decided to let his son publish his work using the family business of Longcross Press which he had founded. The book, longer than the Bible, has run through three editions plus a paperback version. It was the subject of a full- page story by the Daily Telegraph. In January 2009 the Spectator described it as \\"one of the most remarkable books ever written\\". From 1942 he lived in the Inner Temple, where he was the Senior Barrister, and looked after his invalid wife. He completed a further edition of his Companion to British History published by Loncross Denholm Press (Dec 2008). His work \\"Local Council Administration\\" is owned by every Parish, Town, and District Clerk in the country and known in local government circles simply as \\"the Bible\\". The familiar yellow book is one of the master reference books for Local Councils to this day. Many quotes and points from the seventh edition of Local Council Administration, written by Arnold-Baker, were used at the start of each of the seven parts of J.K. Rowling's hugely successful first book for adults, The Casual Vacancy. The title came from a quotation used by Arnold-Baker in point 6.11. Arnold-Baker married in Kensington, London, on 2 January 1943 to Edith May, n√©e Woods (1918‚Äì2010). They had two children: *Henry Charles Edward Alexis von Blumenthal (born 1961) (resumed family surname 1979, confirmed by deed poll 2008), educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford (M.A. Theology), who lives with his wife and two children in Luxembourg. *Katherine Elizabeth Arnold-Baker (born 1948), educated at Wychwood School, who lives with her two children.

The film begins immediately after the fall of Poland. Of the two major Western Allies of 1940, the United Kingdom is first to be mentioned. The role of the Royal Navy in blockading Germany is highlighted, in that it means that Germany must overcome British resistance in order to clear the way for its world conquest. Hitler's treachery towards the small neutral countries of Europe is exposed - to Denmark: \\"We have concluded a non-aggression pact with Denmark\\" - to Norway: \\"Germany never had any quarrel with the Northern States and has none today\\" - to the Netherlands: \\"The new Reich has always endeavored to maintain the traditional friendship with Holland\\" - and to Belgium: \\"The Reich has put forth no claim which may in any way be regarded as a threat to Belgium\\". These quotes are repeated after the conquest of each of these countries is shown. The first targets of the Nazis in 1940 were Denmark and Norway. Nazi interest in Norway is described in terms of Germany's desire to use Norway's fjords as U-boat bases, and to use airfields in Norway for a bomber attack on the British naval base at Scapa Flow. After Hitler's surprise invasion of Denmark is briefly mentioned, the film accuses the Nazis of using Trojan Horse ships - designed to look like merchant ships but concealing troops, tanks and artillery guns - as a way of seizing control of all of Norway's ports. The role of Norwegian traitors such as Vidkun Quisling in aiding the Nazi conquest of Norway is also emphasized. At the end of the section on Norway, Hitler is likened to gangster John Dillinger and Nazi- occupied Norway is portrayed as the northern claw of a giant pincer movement aimed against Britain. The conquest of France would provide the southern claw. The film's story of France begins in 1914 at the Battle of the Marne. The offensive-minded spirit of French general Ferdinand Foch is emphasized: \\"My right is driven in, my center is giving way, the situation is excellent, I attack!\\" (the original in French is displayed on-screen). The film then goes on to describe the defensive orientation of 1930s France, exemplified by the Maginot Line. This is explained as being primarily due to the 6 million casualties which France suffered in World War I, but also due to factors including Nazi fifth column activities, political corruption and greedy vested interests. A famous scene of Divide and Conquer (at 54:50) depicting the departure of the defeated French army from the Marseille harbour, southern France, while France is taken over by the Nazis and the P√©tain regime collaborating with them. That weeping man, , became an iconic depiction of French defeat. Feature film re-enactment of British troops under fire on the beach at Dunkirk. Feature film re-enactment of a British fisherman giving a hand to an Allied soldier while a Stuka's bomb explodes a few metres ahead Actual footage was Mixed in form the Dunkirk evacuation such as French troops embarking on a British ship at Dunkirk footage Possible routes for a German invasion of France are discussed: the 1870 attack through Alsace-Lorraine and the 1914 attack through Belgium. The French, believing the Maginot Line impregnable, expect the German attack to come through Belgium, as in 1914. The French order of battle in 1940 is described: 78 divisions along the border with Belgium, 15 in the Maginot Line, 10 divisions facing Benito Mussolini's forces in Italy and 3¬Ω divisions as a safeguard against Spain. The British Expeditionary Force contributed an additional 10 divisions. The important role of paratroopers in the conquest of the Netherlands is covered, as is the fact that the Germans easily defeated Belgian resistance at Fort Eben-Emael knowing the best method of attack after extensive practice on an exact copy of the fortress built in occupied Czechoslovakia. Special attention is also paid to Nazi atrocities, such as the Rotterdam Blitz after the surrender of the city and Nazi attacks on villages and small towns (designed to choke roads with refugees and thus impede the Allied troop movements). It is then mentioned that the Nazis' attack on Belgium and the Netherlands was a feint to distract from the main attack through the Ardennes, where the Allies least expected it. A U.S. military officer shows an animation which demonstrates the German blitzkrieg technique - tanks form the front spearhead, while infantry spill off from the sides to form solid walls, thus protecting the center of the column through which trucks pass to supply all forces involved.

It was built as the resting place of the powerful and influential Islamic Samanid dynasty that ruled the Samanid Empire from approximately 900 to 1000. It contained three burials, one of whom is known to have been Nasr II. The mausoleum is considered one of the iconic examples of early Islamic architecture and is known as the oldest funerary building of Central Asian architecture. The Samanids established their de facto independence from the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad and ruled over parts of modern Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan. It is the only surviving monument from the Samanid era, but Arthur Upham Pope called it the \\"one of the finest in Persia\\". Perfectly symmetrical, compact in its size, yet monumental in its structure, the mausoleum not only combined multi-cultural building and decorative traditions, such as Sogdian, Sassanian, Persian and even classical and Byzantine architecture, but incorporated features customary for Islamic architecture ‚Äì a circular dome and mini domes, pointed arches, elaborate portals, columns and intricate geometric designs in the brickwork. At each corner, the mausoleum's builders employed squinches, an architectural solution to the problem of supporting the circular-plan dome on a square. The building was buried in silt some centuries after its construction and was revealed during the 20th century by archaeological excavation conducted under the USSR.  History  During the 10th century, Samanids' capital, Bukhara, was a major political, trade and cultural center that patronized science, architecture, medicine, arts and literature. Cultural and economic prosperity was fueled by Samanids' strategic positioning along the trade routes between Asia, Middle East, Russia and Europe. It is believed that the Mausoleum was built to emphasize the dynastic power of the Samani family and to link its history with their newly established capital. There are various estimates by the researchers of when the Mausoleum was built. Some attribute it to the reign of Ismail Samani (), a founder of the dynasty ( 849), some reference Ismail's father, Ahmad, who governed Samarkand. Others attribute the building to the reign of Ismail's grandson, Nasr II who ruled (). The reason for this later attribution is the lintel with inscribed Kufic script with his name found on the eastern side of the building during the restoration works in 1930s. In 1930s, Soviet researchers discovered a copy of a 10th-century waqf document (copied around 1568) that specified that Ismail Samani donated Bukhara's cemetery Naukanda land for what appears to read as a funerary building for his father, Ahmad, confirming earlier assumptions of a dynastic nature of the monument. Before the time of Genghis Khan's siege and sack of Bukhara in 1220, the mausoleum is believed to have been buried in mud and sand from flooding and landslides, remaining so for centuries. Thus, when the Mongol armies reached Bukhara, the tomb was spared from their destruction, unlike most other buildings of that era. For the same reasons, the building was not known to the world until the early 20th century when archaeologists rediscovered it. Major exploratory research and excavations took place during 1926‚Äì1928 by a Soviet team of architects and researchers. During 1937‚Äì1939, the Mausoleum was further studied and major restorations works took place under the leadership of B. N. Zasipkin. Graves of three male bodies have been discovered. One of these is identified as Nasr II from the inscription on the lintel; the identity of the other two is not known. During the Soviet era, some time after World War II, the cemetery that surrounded the Mausoleum was paved over, and an amusement park (still in operation) was built next to and around the building.Samanid Mausoleum, interior detail with squinch Samanid Mausoleum, exterior detail with pointed arches and spandrels Mausoleum, exterior brickwork with blind arcade  Architecture  The monument marks a new era in the development of Persian and Central Asian architecture, which was revived after the Arab conquest of the region. Many researches noted that the structure is made similar to the open, four-arched, often square in shape, Zoroastrian fire temples from Sassanian Iran, commonly known as chahar taq in Persian - a reference to Samanids claim of Sassanian descent. The building's shape is cuboid, like the Kaaba structure of the Great Mosque of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, while heavy fortress-like corner buttresses are derived from Sogdian traditions of Central Asia. The synthetic style of the tomb is reflective of the 9th and 10th centuries - a time when the region still had large populations of Zoroastrians in their early stages of conversion to Islam. Elaborate baked brick decoration is unique in its level of detail and rhythmic patterns and combines multi-cultural decorative motifs (Sogdian, Sassanian, Persian, Arabic, Antique). However, the building architects went beyond simply appropriating existing traditions in building structure and decoration; they introduced new features symbolic for the monumental dynastic architecture. In its structure, Mausoleum's unknown architects used squinches, containing four interior arches and an octagonal structure, that allowed to redistribute the weight of the circular dome over a square base, an alternative to pendentives. Overall, the building is constructed in a form of a small, slightly tapering cube, with each side approximately long. There are four identically designed facades which gently slope inwards with increasing height. Wall thickness of approximately at the base of the building assured structural solidity and survival through the ages. Each side has an entrance portal adorned with pointed arches. Many researches note well-studied, almost mathematical, proportions of the building and its harmonious hierarchy. The base of the building is heavy which is accentuated by a wider foundation; four heavy built in three-quarter corner columns, classical in design, contribute to its fortress-like appearance. The top of the building is lightened up through an elegant arcade gallery, placed below the cornice, that have many arched openings to reduce overall weight and to let light inside the building (in contrast, most of chahar taq structures had no windows). A large semi- circular Dome, about 23 ft (7 meters) in diameter crowns the structure and it is similar to the Buddhist domes in the area. Four mini domes placed in the corners of the roof are more decorative in nature. Overall, the mausoleum's builders achieved an elegant hierarchy of diminishing proportions and vertical perspective through the diminishing size of the domes (one large and four small), columns (placed in the corners, portals and gallery) and arches (portals and gallery). Typical for Islamic architecture in general, there is an overlap and ambiguity between the structural and decorative features within the building ‚Äì bricks being structure and d√©cor, both equally important. Builders used baked brick of various rectangular and square sizes for both structural and decorative elements of the building. Large bricks formed large bands throughout the building for structural stability, smaller bricks were used for decoration, usually in blocks of two to five bricks. Baked brick was a known material in the region, yet such extensive and creative use is considered unprecedented. Local builders mostly used unbaked brick, stucco and wood as these materials were cheaper, but not as strong as baked brick. The Mausoleum uses a few stucco and wood elements but these are minimal in terms of their relative share in the construction process. A few bounding compounds were discovered during the excavations, alabaster being one of them. It is interesting that due to Islamic restrictions on use of imagery, Samanid Mausoleum decoration in mostly geometric in its layout and patterns, in comparison with the pre-Islamic Central Asian building traditions that blended architecture, sculpture and painting. Researchers found common elements between the Samanid Mausoleum d√©cor and design patterns executed in wood from the 8th century Penjikent. Repeated patterns create calculated harmony and a sense of infinity, important for a funerary structure. Patterns of great variety, executed in baked brick include basketweave, checkerboard, \\"dog tooth\\" ornament (on spandrels and the main dome), borders of rosettes, floral ornaments, ribbons, and bands of pearls. There is a notable consistency between the exterior and interior decor in terms of patterns, materials and approach and this signifies that the construction was most likely performed by the same person or team. Repeat pattern of decor and general symmetry were helpful during the restoration works in 1930s as archaeologists used surviving elements to restore those that had been lost. Careful studies of the type of materials, mortar, patterns, thickness and forms of historic layers were conducted before the restoration works began. Prior to renovations, most of the damage was located at the gallery level. Some time during the 20th century, metal screens were installed within the portals to restrict access to the building. It is not known if the original portals had any screens installed. Significance The fact that the religious law of orthodox Sunni Islam strictly prohibits the construction of mausoleums over burial places stresses the significance of the Samanid mausoleum, which is the oldest surviving monument of Islamic architecture in Central Asia and the sole monument that survived from the era of the Samanid dynasty. The Samanid Mausoleum might be one of the earliest departures from that religious restriction in the history of Islamic architecture. The building is regarded as one of the oldest monuments in the Bukhara region. Samanid Mausoleum appears in virtually every survey on the Islamic architecture and is significant as an example of early Islamic architecture in the Central Asia and worldwide. Its unknown creators harmoniously combined references to the prior regional traditions and deployed innovative structural elements, such as squinches, as well as new for the time features that are considered customary for the Islamic architecture worldwide. Samanid Mausoleum is sometimes referred to as a \\"Jewel Box\\" due to its compact size and elegant, mathematically calculated proportions and rhythmic patterns of its intricate, unprecedented baked brick decoration. The mausoleum of Pakistan's founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah--Mazar-e-Quaid is modeled after the Samanid Mausoleum.

History In the 19th century mining schools under government patronage were being established all across the British Empire. There were at the time three mining schools in Cornwall; at Camborne, Penzance and Redruth and it was felt that they should be combined. The newly amalgamated school would occupy the Camborne Mining School site and the Camborne Mining School brand be continued. Mr. W. Ficher Wilkinson was appointed as the first principal of the newly formed School of Metalliferous Mining. He was educated at Harrow and at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology in Germany. The school later included Camborne in the title creating the Camborne School Of Metalliferous Mining, and in 1975 the school changed its name to Camborne School of Mines to better describe its academic activities. Amalgamated mining schools Redruth Mining School The Redruth School of Mines and Art School opened in 1882 or 83 and was located somewhere in Clinton Road to the east of the town. With the removal of mining education to Camborne the site became the Science and Art School and continued to teach art and science. A wing of the Redruth Mining School was a large mineral museum called the Robert Hunt Memorial Museum erected by The Miners Association of Devon and Cornwall to the memory of Robert Hunt FRS, keeper of the Mining Record Office in London. This museum remained open until 1950 when it closed and the specimens were taken to the Camborne School of Mines. Camborne Mining School The Camborne campus of Camborne School of Mines, as it became known, was located just off Camborne High-street in Trevithick Road. In 1876 George Basset, the great mine entrepreneur, made a bequest to build a laboratory in Camborne, The Basset Building, for the use of the pupils of The Miners Association. In 1882 the adjacent Camborne Science and Art School building opened. Until the amalgamation of the schools in 1910 Mr. J.J. Beringer had been principal for 28 years. Penzance Mining School The Penzance Mining and Science School opened on 7 October 1890, at a cost for building and fittings of nearly ¬£1,900. The school consisted of two floors, the ground floor housed the technical instruction hall and the lecture theatre and upstairs chemical lecture rooms, class rooms and a laboratory filled with working benches for 24 students, a furnace room for metallurgical work and a balance room. Andrew Ketcham Barnett was the first principal of the Mining and Science School at Penzance, which had been established due to his classes on mineralogy in 1873. Philip Burne Corin (1860-1933) was a master here from 1893 to 1910.

The classical four- vertex theorem states that the curvature function of a simple, closed, smooth plane curve has at least four local extrema (specifically, at least two local maxima and at least two local minima). The name of the theorem derives from the convention of calling an extreme point of the curvature function a vertex. This theorem has many generalizations, including a version for space curves where a vertex is defined as a point of vanishing torsion. Examples An ellipse has exactly four vertices: two local maxima of curvature where it is crossed by the major axis of the ellipse, and two local minima of curvature where it is crossed by the minor axis. In a circle, every point is both a local maximum and a local minimum of curvature, so there are infinitely many vertices. History The four-vertex theorem was first proved for convex curves (i.e. curves with strictly positive curvature) in 1909 by Syamadas Mukhopadhyaya. His proof utilizes the fact that a point on the curve is an extremum of the curvature function if and only if the osculating circle at that point has 4th-order contact with the curve (in general the osculating circle has only 3rd-order contact with the curve). The four-vertex theorem was proved in general by Adolf Kneser in 1912 using a projective argument. Proof For many years the proof of the four-vertex theorem remained difficult, but a simple and conceptual proof was given by , based on the idea of the minimum enclosing circle.. This is a circle that contains the given curve and has the smallest possible radius. If the curve includes an arc of the circle, it has infinitely many vertices. Otherwise, the curve and circle must be tangent at at least two points. At each tangency, the curvature of the curve is greater than that of the circle (else the curve would continue from the tangency outside the circle rather than inside). However, between each pair of tangencies, the curvature must decrease to less than that of the circle, for instance at a point obtained by translating the circle until it no longer contains any part of the curve between the two points of tangency and considering the last point of contact between the translated circle and the curve. Therefore, there is a local minimum of curvature between each pair of tangencies, giving two of the four vertices. There must be a local maximum of curvature between each pair of local minima, giving the other two vertices.. Converse The converse to the four-vertex theorem states that any continuous, real-valued function of the circle that has at least two local maxima and two local minima is the curvature function of a simple, closed plane curve. The converse was proved for strictly positive functions in 1971 by Herman Gluck as a special case of a general theorem on pre-assigning the curvature of n-spheres. The full converse to the four-vertex theorem was proved by Bj√∂rn Dahlberg shortly before his death in January 1998, and published posthumously. Dahlberg's proof uses a winding number argument which is in some ways reminiscent of the standard topological proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Application to mechanics One corollary of the theorem is that a homogeneous, planar disk rolling on a horizontal surface under gravity has at least 4 balance points. A discrete version of this is that there cannot be a monostatic polygon. However, in three dimensions there do exist monostatic polyhedra, and there also exists a convex, homogeneous object with exactly 2 balance points (one stable, and the other unstable), the G√∂mb√∂c. illustration of the Four-vertex theorem at an ellipse Discrete variations There are several discrete versions of the four-vertex theorem, both for convex and non-convex polygons.Pak, I. Lectures on Discrete and Polyhedral Geometry , Section 21. Here are some of them: * (Bilinski) The sequence of angles of a convex equilateral polygon with at least four vertices has at least four extrema. * The sequence of side lengths of a convex equiangular polygon with at least four sides has at least four extrema. * (Musin) A circle circumscribed around three consecutive vertices of a polygon with at least four vertices is called extremal if it contains all remaining vertices of the polygon, or has none of them in its interior. Such a convex polygon is generic if it has no four vertices on the same circle. Then every generic convex polygon with at least four vertices has at least four extremal circles. * (Legendre‚ÄìCauchy) Two convex n-gons with equal corresponding side length have either zero or at least 4 sign changes in the cyclic sequence of the corresponding angle differences. * (A.D. Alexandrov) Two convex n-gons with parallel corresponding sides and equal area have either zero or at least 4 sign changes in the cyclic sequence of the corresponding side lengths differences. Some of these variations are stronger than the other, and all of them imply the (usual) four-vertex theorem by a limit argument. Generalizations to space curve The stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane preserves critical points of geodesic curvature. Thus simple closed spherical curves have four vertices. Furthermore, on the sphere vertices of a curve correspond to points where its torsion vanishes. So for space curves a vertex is defined as a point of vanishing torsion. In 1994 V. D. Sedykh showed that every simple closed space curve which lies on the boundary of a convex body has four vertices. In 2015 Mohammad Ghomi generalized Sedykh's theorem to all curves which bound a locally convex disk.

The doloire or wagoner's axe was a tool and weapon used during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The axe had a wooden shaft measuring approximately 1.5 metres (5 feet) in length and a head that was pointed at the top and rounded at the bottom, resembling either a teardrop or an isosceles triangle. The top of the shaft was fitted with a metal eye or socket that was welded to the head of the axe near the base of the blade. The upper part of the blade extended above the eye, while the opposite side of the socket featured a small blunt hammer head. The head of the axe itself measured approximately 44 cm. (17 inches) in length, was sharpened on the back and flattened bottom edges, and was uniformly decorated with punched and incised abstract floral patterns. The term doloire is derived from the Latin dolabra, a tool axe used by Roman legionaries. Its alternative name wagoner's axe originates from the fact that it was found most often in the hands of a wagoner, the man in charge of the supply trains accompanying troops on the march. The wagoner used the axe not only as a tool for working and shaping wood and repairing or building carts and wooden structures but also as a weapon for self defense. Doloire \\"de droite\\" (right adze) While the hammer portion of the doloire could also be used offensively, its primary function was utilitarian. However, on display in the castle of Spiez in Switzerland, among other arms and armour, is a doloire with an opposing fluke or spike in place of a hammer, designed to penetrate body armour and indicating its primary purpose as a weapon. There are also smaller, one-handed forms of the doloire, closer in size to a hatchet, and one of these is depicted in a woodcut by Albrecht Altdorfer from the Triumphal Procession of the Emperor Maximilian series of 1517. It is shown being carried, along with a boar spear, by a carpenter or wagoner accompanying a supply train. References * Waldman, John.

History The George V, named for King George V of the United Kingdom, opened in 1928. It was financed, at a cost of $31 million (60 million Francs), by American businessman Joel Hillman. It was managed by restaurateur Andr√© Terrail, owner of La Tour d'Argent. Its architect was Georges Wybo, who had designed the Casino de Deauville and the reconstruction of the Printemps Haussmann following the fire of 1921. The hotel was popular with Americans arriving in France on Transatlantic ocean liners, as it operated offices in the port of Cherbourg to receive customers on their arrival. Joel Hillman was forced to relinquish the George V to his lenders after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The George V was bought in 1931 by the banker Fran√ßois Dupr√© and a new wing was built by the original architects, for apartments rented year-round or season, enjoying the services of the hotel. He brought many objects of art to the hotel, including tapestries from Flanders, Boulle furniture, a Renoir and a Dufy. In World War II, during the German occupation, a \\"round-table\\" of French and German intellectuals met at the hotel; including the writer Ernst Junger, the Nazi legal scholar Carl Schmitt, the publisher Gaston Gallimard and the writers Paul Morand, Jean Cocteau, and Henry Millon de Montherlant. In 1996 Saudi businessman Al-Waleed bin Talal bought the hotel from the Forte Group, spending $185 million for it. He then spent $120 million renovating the hotel, closing the hotel for two years. He signed a management contract with Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts on November 1, 1997, and the hotel was renamed Four Seasons Hotel George V. The hotel reopened on December 18, 1999.http://www.historichotelsthenandnow.com/georgevparis.html Starting in 2000, the hotel was voted \\"Best Hotel in the World\\" by a number of publications.

It is about west of Malton on the B1257 road. According to the 2001 Census had a population (including Fryton) of 634, increasing to 665 at the 2011 Census. History The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as \\"Selungesbi\\" in the \\"Maneshou hundred\\". It was part of the Hovingham manor, but some land was owned by Orm, son of Gamul at the time of the Norman invasion. Afterwards land around the manor were split between Hugh, son of Baldric and Count Robert of Mortain. The manor passed to the Mowbray family until 1322, when John de Mowbray was beheaded for rising against the Crown. The Wyville family held land under the Mowbray's. The Hastings family held the manor until 1595 when it was purchased by Sir Charles Cavendish, father of Sir Charles Cavendish, whose family held it for the next hundred years until they sold to the Duke of Buckingham. In 1751 the manor was sold to the fourth Earl of Carlisle, whose family hold the title to this day. The Mowbray's built a castle in the village, but this had fallen into disrepair by the time the Hastings built another in 1345. This was removed by the Cavendish's and rebuilt where the remains can still be seen today just off the High Street. They are a Grade II LIsted Building. The village used to have a railway station on the Thirsk & Malton Line. The station opened in June 1853 and closed to passengers in 1931 and freight in 1964. Governance The village lies within the Thirsk and Malton parliamentary constituency. It is also in the Hovingham ward of Ryedale District Council. It is within the Hovingham and Sheriff Hutton electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council. Slingsby Parish covers the hamlets of Fryton and South Holme. The Parish Council reflects this in its membership with five councillors representing Slingsby and one each representing the other two hamlets. Geography The village lies west of Malton on the B1257 road to Hovingham, Helmsley and the North York Moors. The stretch of road from Malton to Hovingham, part of an old Roman road, is known locally as the Street with some of the neighbouring villages to the east having Street suffixed, such as Barton-le-Street and Appleton-le- Street. The nearest settlements are the hamlets of Fryton to the west and South Holme to the north. The street village of Barton-le-Street is 1.5 miles to the east. Wath Beck runs north east around the edge of the village on its way to join the nearby River Rye. Slingsby lies at the foot of the gently sloping land which forms the northern edge of the Howardian Hills (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), with the Vale of Pickering spreading out to its north and east. Demography In 1881 the UK Census recorded the population of 596. In the 2001 UK Census, the population was recorded as 634 across 283 households. Of that population, 48.7% were male and 51.3% were female with 532 being over the age of sixteen years. There were 291 dwellings, of which 104 were detached properties. Amenities Slingsby - The Green with Maypole in front of School A school was built on The Green in 1860 and is still in use. It is a Grade II listed building. In front of the building is a traditional Maypole. The primary school is within the catchment area for Malton School for secondary education. The village has numerous small to medium size businesses. There are two camping sites, one near the old railway line and the other on Green Dike Lane. There is a public house in the village. The village is served by the bus route between Malton and Helmsley. There is a sports club in the village that provides for football, tennis, bowling and cricket. Slingsby Football Club competes in the Beckett League. Religion The Parish Church, Slingsby The parish church, at the western side of the village, is dedicated to All Saints. The present church was built in the late 1860s in the style of its predecessor on the same site, which was demolished. It is mainly 15th- century in style with Victorian modifications, and is a Grade II listed building. With neighbouring parishes, Slingsby‚Äôs Anglican church belongs to the Benefice of the Street Parishes, which is part of the Diocese of York. The Methodist Chapel was built in 1837 on a site adjacent to the village green and is a Grade II listed building. John Wesley himself had preached in Slingsby in 1757.

It is located between Ballintemple and the larger suburbs of Douglas and Blackrock. History Croker's 1815 survey of the Ballinlough Stone Among the earliest written references to the townland and then village of Ballinlough date from 1601 (as \\"Ballinlogha\\") in the Calendar to Fiants of reign of Henry VIII, and from 1655 (as \\"Ballinloghy\\") in the Down Survey. These Irish language names (\\"Baile an Locha\\", the town of the lake) reflected the position of the village focal-points (including Ballinlough House and the original Ballinlough school), close to Lough Mahon and the Douglas River Estuary. The Ballinlough Stone, a standing stone near Ballinlough House, was surveyed by antiquary Thomas Crofton Croker in the early 19th century. Later archaeological surveys of the stone question whether its origins are prehistoric, or if it is a less ancient boundary marker. In the 19th century, land use in the area was mainly focused on farming and market gardening. The larger farms were managed from estate houses including Ballinlough House, Ardfallen House, Thorn Hill House, and LakeVille/Ravenscourt. From the early 20th century, with Cork city expanding east, and the village expanding west, the area became more suburbanised. This included the building of housing developments during the 1920s and 1930s in the neighbouring and sub-townlands of Browingstown, Coppingers Stang, and Knockrea. Early 20th century censuses however still recorded 17 market gardeners in the area. With the construction of a new church in 1938, two additional schools in 1944 and 1965, and a later community centre, the focal- points of the (now) suburb shifted westward towards the city. Previously separated by remaining green belts and outside the city's administrative area, Ballinlough is now within the Cork City Council administrative boundary and zoned as a suburban residential area. Amenities There are three primary schools situated in Ballinlough: St. Anthony's Boys National School, Eglantine Girls National School, and Our Lady of Lourdes Girls National School. A further primary school, Rockboro School, lies on the border with South Parish on the Boreenmana Road. The community centre in Ballinough includes a public park and a number of buildings which host community activities. The main building hosts a Montessori school, bowls and bingo events. The 38th/40th Cork Scout Group (a member of Scouting Ireland) is also based in the community centre in Ballinlough, as are the Junior, Intermediate and Senior youth clubs (affiliated with √ìgra Chorca√≠). Ballinlough Tennis Club has five outdoor courts in the community centre complex, and is accredited to Tennis Ireland's \\"gold\\" standard for facilities and club management. The P√°irc U√≠ Rinn Gaelic Athletic Association grounds and the Cork Constitution rugby club lie on the border between Ballinlough and Ballintemple. Ballinlough is an independent Roman Catholic parish of the Cork and Ross Catholic Diocese and is home to Our Lady of Lourdes Church. It is also the location of the Wesley chapel of the Cork Methodist Church - which also operates a sheltered housing complex from the grounds of Ardfallen House.

It was incorporated as a joint stock company in 1980 through a special decree by the Amir of Bahrain. It obtained an offshore banking unit licence from the Bahrain Monetary Agency on 7 April 1980, and began operations in the same month. The bank is listed on the Bahrain Bourse and its major shareholders are the Central Bank of Libya (59.37%) and Kuwait Investment Authority (40.63%). Its network spreads across 17 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Europe, the Americas and Asia. It is expanding its retail banking network in the MENA region. Bank ABC is a provider of trade finance, treasury, project and structured finance, syndications, corporate and institutional banking as well as Islamic banking services. History By April 1981, US$750 million had been fully paid by Bank ABC‚Äôs original three shareholders: the Ministry of Finance of Kuwait (whose shares have since been transferred to the Kuwait Investment Authority), the Libyan Secretariat of Treasury (whose shares were later transferred to the Central Bank of Libya) and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. At the end of 1989, ABC‚Äôs authorised share capital was increased to US$1.50 Billion and in June 1990, paid-up capital was raised to US$1.00 Billion through an international share offering. In June 2006, ABC‚Äôs shares were split 10 for 1 in order to boost trading activities by placing them in the same range as other shares quoted on the Bahrain Bourse. At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in April 2008 ABC‚Äôs shareholders approved an increase in the authorized capital of the bank from US$1.5 billion to US$2.5 billion and an increase in issued and paid up capital from US$1.0 billion to US$2.0 billion by way of a priority rights share offering to existing shareholders. Another Extraordinary General Meeting was held on January 28, 2010 to approve an increase in the authorized capital from US$2.5 billion to US$3.5 billion and an increase in issued and paid up capital from US$2.0 billion to US$3.11 billion by way of a priority rights share offering to existing shareholders. In December 2010 the Central Bank of Libya acquired the 17.72% shareholding of Abu Dhabi Investment Authority in ABC, increasing its stake to 59.37%. In June 2015 Arab Banking Corporation revamped its corporate identity and changed its brand name to Bank ABC. The bank‚Äôs new identity launch coincides with the commemoration of its 35th anniversary. The change to a single, unifying global brand name and corporate identity toke effect on 15 June 2015 across the Bank‚Äôs global network spanning 18 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Europe, the Americas and Asia (with the exception of its subsidiary in Brazil, which will keep its own identity as Banco ABC Brasil).

A major party in its time, the Liberals were one of the historic predecessors of the Liberal State Party, and therefore of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy.  History History before foundation Liberals had been an important political force in the Netherlands. Since 1848 they were the dominant political force. They were organised in loose political clubs and caucuses. Liberals were divided between progressive, centrist and conservative liberals, but because of the lack of organised political parties, these divisions were not very strong. In 1879 the division became explicit when a separate parliamentary party was formed by supporters of Kappeyne van de Copello. With the rise of both catholic and protestant parties, the liberals were forced to organise themselves better. Foundation In 1885 all the liberal political clubs and caucuses were united in the Liberal Union. The Union was factionalised: it had a progressive, a conservative and a centrist faction. In 1888 the liberals were forced into opposition by a majority of the confessional political parties. In 1891 the confessional parties lost their majority and a liberal cabinet led by Van Tienhoven is formed. The cabinet's most important proposal is the relaxation of the census, proposed by minister of home affairs Tak: the law would grant the right to vote to all men able to read and write. All political parties were divided on the subject and with a very narrow majority the proposal was rejected. In reaction to this the cabinet resigns and new elections are held. In these elections the division between pro-suffrage Takkians and anti-suffrage anti- Takkians grows. The Liberal Union is also split on the subject. A group of conservative liberals leaves the party. They remained a loose political club until 1906, when they founded the League of Free Liberals. The 1894 elections are won by anti-Takkians and the Liberal Union is confined to opposition. After the 1897 elections the liberals regain their majority and a cabinet led Pierson enacts a series of social laws, including the Learning Obligation law, which forces all children to go to school between the ages of six and twelve in order to combat child labour. In 1901 the progressive liberals in the party founded the Free-thinking Liberal League together with the Radicale Bond. This causes the liberals to lose their majority in the subsequent elections. In 1905 however a cabinet was formed by the two liberal parties, led by De Meester. In 1909 they lost their majority to the confessional parties again. The 1913 election resulted in no clear majority: the Social Democratic Workers' Party were asked to join the liberals in a coalition. They refuse however. An extra-parliamentary cabinet was formed by Cort van der Linden, formed by liberals from all three liberal parties. This cabinet enacts universal suffrage and ends the Schoolstrijd. After the disastrous 1918 elections, in which the liberals lose half of their seats: they fall from thirty-seven to twenty seats. In 1921 the Liberals merged with the League of Free Liberals, and several minor liberal parties (the Economic League, Middle Class Party and the Neutral Party to form the Liberal State Party, the mainstream liberal party. Ideology and issues The Union started out as a moderately progressive liberal party, committed to the freedom of the individual. Gradually it became more conservative. It was in favour of a small government, which nonetheless got its income from progressive taxation and would enact social legislation. The party was fiscally conservative. It furthermore was in favour of the universal suffrage and proportional representation.

Relationships to other parties The Liberal Union formed a loose alliance with the League of Free Liberals and the Free-thinking Liberal League. The parties cooperated in several cabinets. The liberal legislation to extend suffrage and to better the position of workers was often supported by the Social Democratic Workers' Party.

The 701st was inactivated in 2007 and replaced with the 601st Air & Space Operations Center, which later became the 601st Air Operations Center. History Patch showing the emblem of the 701st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron and 701st Radar Squadron. Before becoming the 701st ADS, the unit was known as the 701st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron and the 701st Radar Squadron. For most of its existence, the unit was located at Fort Fisher Air Force Station near Kure Beach, North Carolina. With the closure of Fort Fisher AFS in the late 1980s, the 701st was moved to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia and collocated with First Air Force headquarters. During this time the unit also became the 701st Air Defense Squadron. In 1991, both First Air Force and the 701st relocated to Tyndall AFB. Between 1995 and 1997, both organizations transitioned from the US Air Force to the Air National Guard. As part of the transition, active duty 701st military personnel were replaced with members of the Florida Air National Guard. After the 11 September attacks, the role of homeland defense was greatly expanded necessitating a restructuring of First Air Force units. Part of this expansion was the inactivation of the 701st and its replacement by the 601st Air Operations Group.

The battle was a success for the Han, who were led by Zheng Ji. The king of Jushi Wugui surrendered to the Han after the Han launched the attack from the Tarim Basin and besieged the city Jiaohe, capital of Jushi. The Xiongnu came with aid to Jushi, but escaped after Zheng Ji and Sima Xi confronted the armies. Zheng Ji then left 20 men with a general to protect the king of Jushi, but he was afraid of the return of Xiongnu, and fled to Wusun. The Xiongnu installed Doumo as the king of Jushi, and moved the population further east from Jiaohe. Zheng Ji then sent 300 men to seize the city. Aftermath In 60 BC, an internal disturbance occurred among the Xiongnu ruling clique, and Xianxianshan, Prince Rizhu of the Xiongnu stationed in the Turpan Basin, led 12,000 of his troops and 12 royals to pledge allegiance to the Han imperial court. That same year, the Han appointed Zheng Ji as the Protector General of the Western Regions, with his office in Wulei (near Qiuci) to oversee the entire region of the Tarim Basin west to the Pamir. The last Protector General, Dan Qin, was killed during a rebellion led by Yanqi in 13 AD. A brief attempt to restore the protector generalship was launched by Wang Mang in 16 AD, under the new appointed Protector General Li Chong. The armies soon advanced towards the state of Yanqi, but were eventually defeated by Yanqi with its allies. Li Chong fled to the state of Qiuci, and died soon after the fall of Xin Dynasty.

The team was named after the Rhodope Mountains and plays its home matches at the local Stadion Septemvri. They play in green and white kits. Rodopa was founded in 1927, however it was not until 2002 when it played in the A Group for the first time in its history. The team managed to remain four seasons in the top division, before falling down all the way to the fourth tier, where it played until 2019, when promotion to the third tier was achieved. History The Beginning Smolyan has had various football clubs in different periods, the most notable of them being Rodopets (since 1957). FC Rodopa was formed by separating from the local sports association in 1985. However, prior to that Smolyan has football team representation in both B and V groups. Member of the Bulgarian Elite The team qualified for the top division for the first time in their history, by winning the Bulgarian B Football Group in the 2002-03 season. In their first season in the Bulgarian elite, the team managed to finish in 10th place, which was a success for Rodopa, since they avoided relegation. The team achieved 10 wins, 3 draws and 17 losses, which earned them 33 points. They also managed to beat Bulgarian powerhouse PFC Levski Sofia at home. In their second top-flight season, Rodopa achieved a 12th place finish, being one point above relegated PFC Vidima- Rakovski Sevlievo. In their third season in A PFG, Rodopa Smolyan finished 12th, 2 points above relegated Pirin 1922 Blagoevgrad. In the 2006-07 season, Rodopa did not perform so well, and they were relegated to the B PFG, after finishing 15th. Lower Leagues After the 2006-07 season, the team began experiencing serious financial problems, which ultimately lead to the team dropping all the way into the fourth tier, where it used to play until 2019, the Regional Amateur Leagues. Rodopa managed to return to the Bulgarian third league for the 2019-20 season. The team will play in the Southeast Third League, based on the geographic location of their home town, Smolyan. Rodopa finished 12th in the third tier for the 2019-20 season.

The trio travels the United States investigating \\"cold case\\" homicide and missing persons cases. The premise of the series was that this \\"team of unconventional investigators\\" could shed new light on unsolved crimes. The series began production in October 2005 and premiered on Court TV (now truTV) December 21, 2005 with a run of 9 episodes in Season 1. Season 2 premiered on June 20, 2007. There were 4 hour-long special episodes comprising Season 3. The series ended production after a total of 27 episodes, and is currently still broadcast in worldwide syndication as of 2019. The psychic-crime paranormal reality series stars well-known psychic profiler Carla Baron, medium John J. Oliver, and paranormal investigator Patrick Burns.  Episodes  Season 1 Season 2 Season 3  Results  None of the cases investigated by the show were solved because of the show. Two cases were later closed by police work: *Episode 107, \\"Mystery in the Desert\\", Season 1: the perpetrator of the crime, Gabriel Avila, was linked to Katie Sepich via DNA evidence, in December 2006. *Episode 209, \\"Wiregrass Murders\\", Season 2: Coley McCraney was charged in April 2019 with the murder of the two girls using DNA and genetic genealogy. Managing editor of Skeptical Inquirer, Ben Radford writes that shows like Haunting Evidence prey on vulnerable and desperate families hoping to find evidence. Reality shows like this are not entertainment, yet are presented as such. \\"The only 'success' was in producing another television show lending credibility to psychics who have once again clearly and demonstrably failed to give useful information\\". In a 2008 follow- up of his previous article, Radford states that he had hoped he would be able to report back that the Haunting Evidence team had successfully solved many crimes, but that was not the case. Of the nine cases featured, zero were solved by the team. The one case solved, Katie Sepich was solved \\"by science, not psychics\\". DNA was matched to the killer who later confessed, the police give no credit to Haunting Evidence. The Tara Baker family profiled on the first season shared with Radford that [psychics and the producers] \\"feed on the emotions of people in real tragedies\\", and called Baron 'a real fruit loop'\\". Oliver claimed the police have the DNA evidence already. The team also presented a sketch of the murderer and stated that she knew her killer. Tara Baker's murder as of 2011 remains unsolved.  Investigation of Carla Baron's claims  The Independent Investigative Group IIG looked into 14 cases where Carla Baron claimed to have assisted detectives, including JonBen√©t Ramsey, Elizabeth Smart and Nicole Brown Simpson. In all 14 cases the IIG contacted the police (or in the case of Nicole Simpson, they received an email from Denise Brown) all mostly saying the same things, \\"we have never heard of this person\\" or \\"the information provided (by Baron) did not produce any new leads in the investigation\\". IIG's conclusion is that she has never provided any help in any investigation, and her claims stating such are unsubstantiated. The IIG feels that because humans are basically compassionate we have invented forensic science as well as Amber Alert and websites such as NCMEC to really help support victims of crimes. Psychic detectives like Carla Baron might claim compassion but are essentially paid agents with book sales, TV shows, lectures and private readings. Why are they needed when they cannot show one single case of evidence proving they have been helpful? In March 2003, Svelana Aronov's body was found in New York's Upper East River. Family and friends consulted Carla Baron by email who stated that Svelana was fleeing an \\"obsessed kidnapper\\" and jumped into the freezing waters to escape. Police at the 19th Precinct could not confirm Baron's statement that she had a \\"lengthy conversation with a detective.\\" A friend that reached out to Baron and other psychic detectives said they (psychics) only yielded \\"aggravation\\". Close friends and family members now say they distrust Baron who they say \\"provided no useful insights and demanded media attention from the start.\\" The New York medical examiner now says that it was probably suicide. In 2004 Carla Baron was approached by Susan Tusing, the mother of slain murder victim Amanda Tusing, who had been found murdered in June 2000. Baron gave detectives the first name of the killer. Detective Jack McCann said that \\"we talked to the name and came up with several other people (with the same name) and nothing came up.\\" On April 13, 2011, 20-year-old nursing student Holly Bobo went missing from her home in Darden, Tennessee. Carla Baron was initially contacted by a friend of the family and Baron claims to have offered her services for free but the family refused to consult with her. On Baron's personal website she states that one condition she imposed on the family is that she is to be the only psychic officially working the case. When the family rejected her offer for help Baron stated (the family) chose not to seek her information on Holly's death on the advice of the police, who, Baron believes, were \\"terrified to hear what I might have to say\\" about the abduction. The response to this from Baron's website, \\"This, my friends, is yet another \\"control\\" tactic deployed by the infinite 'powers-that-be' within gov't jurisdiction to let all of us (a.k.a., the 'public') know ‚ÄìWho's really running the show. Let's not let anyone steal their proverbial thunder, shall we?\\". Skeptic investigator Ben Radford, writing for Discovery News, said that the police and the family probably decided not to seek Baron's help because psychic detectives have a \\"zero track record of success\\". While some psychics may be well-intended they do waste the police's time. Radford concluded that \\"Despite the efforts of dozens of psychics over two months, Bobo remains missing, the case remains unsolved.\\" A new search was started for Bobo after a dog found what appeared to be her purse near her home; upon closer examination, Bobo's mother says it is not her daughter's purse.

She was the daughter of the Prussian Field Marshal Count Samuel von Schmettau and the mother of Prince Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin. Early life She was born in Berlin on 28 August 1748, the daughter of Prussian Field Marshall Samuel von Schmettau. Her father died when she was very young, and at the age of four or five, her mother placed her in a convent school in Breslau. At the age of nine, she was brought back home to Berlin and taught by private tutors. At the age of fourteen or fifteen she attended a French finishing academy in the city for two years.Brownson, Sarah. Life of Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, Prince and Priest, Fr Pustet & Co., New York, 1873 After leaving finishing school, Amalie was introduced into society and invited to become one of the maids of honor to Margravine Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt, wife of Prince Ferdinand, brother of Frederick the Great. It was while on an excursion with Princess Ferdinand and other ladies of court to the spa at Aachen, that she met Prince Dimitri Gallitzin. Prince Gallitzin was returning to Saint Petersburg, having completed fourteen years serving as Catherine the Great's ambassador to France. Princess Gallitzin Princess Gallitzin in the circle of her friends On 28 August 1768, her twentieth birthday, she married the Prince in a chapel at Aix-la-Chapelle. The couple proceeded to Saint Petersburg, where her husband was given a posting as Imperial Ambassador to Holland. On the way to The Hague, they stopped in Berlin, where her daughter Princess Marianna was born on 7 December 1769. The family stayed there some time before continuing to The Hague, where on 22 December 1770, her son Prince Demetri was born. At the age of 24 she forsook society suddenly and devoted herself to the education of her children. She applied herself to the study of mathematics, classical philology, and philosophy under Franz Hemsterhuis, who kindled her enthusiasm for Socratic-Platonic idealism, and later under the name of \\"Diokles\\" dedicated to her the \\"Diotima\\", his Lettres sur l'atheisme.Schlager, Patricius. \\"Adele Amalie Gallitzin.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

She was able to gather around her, at Muenster, a mystical-literary cenacle which had a considerable influence on the German spiritual life of the time. Here she soon became the centre of a set of intellectual men led by F√ºrstenberg. This circle also included the gymnasial teachers (whom she incited to the deeper study of Plato), Bernhard Heinrich Overberg, the reformer of popular school education, Clemens August von Droste- Vischering, Count Leopold zu Stolberg, and the philosopher Johann Georg Hamann, who was interred in her garden. The poet Matthias Claudius of the \\"Wandsbecker Bote\\" was also a familiar visitor, and Johann Wolfgang Goethe said that his hours in this circle were among his most pleasant recollections. A severe illness in 1786 led her to the reading of Sacred Scripture, and her return to religion. On 28 August 1786, at the insistence of Overberg, she approached the confessional for the first time in many years. Soon afterwards, she made Overberg her chaplain. Under his influence, she underwent a complete change which affected all her surroundings. Her religious life took on a larger importance. She became the centre of Roman Catholic activity in M√ºnster. In those revolutionary times, she provided for the spread of religious writings, proved a support for the religious faith of many of her friends, and induced others, among them Count Stolberg, to make their peace with the Church. In 1797 Johann Theodor Katerkamp joined her household as a private tutor. She was known for gentle charity and as a model for religious life. Portions of her correspondence and diaries were published by Scheuter (M√ºnster, 1874‚Äì76) in three parts. She was the mother of the well-known American missionary Prince Demetrius Gallitzin. She died in Angelmodde.  Notes  References  * Further reading *Villa, V.M. T√≠tol= Gallitzin, Amalia Adelheid von.. P√†g. 20. Gonz√°lez Porto-Bompiani (coord.). Diccionario de autores, vol II.

The plot tells of a teenage boy who comes back to life as a zombie, similar to the plot of the American film My Boyfriend's Back. Plot While working in the church, Grace finds a hidden crypt. While exploring she discovers a voodoo book, however she is soon sent away by Father Cornelius. Grace's son, Nathan attends the local high school, with his friends Henry and Diggs. Nathan likes his long-time friend Jessica however is too scared to ask her out, in case he is rejected. Also in the school are popular girls Charlotte, Glenda and Cheryl. Cheryl pursues Nathan, despite already having a boyfriend, Samson, who confronts Nathan along with his womanising friend Kenneth after seeing Cheryl talking to Nathan. Meanwhile, Henry and Diggs, fed up with Nathan not asking out Jessica, force the pair to meet after school. While Nathan waits for Jessica, he writes a note about what he will say to her to ask her out. Meanwhile, Jessica's over-protective father forbids her to leave, but she sneaks out. Nathan becomes impatient due to Jessica's lateness and leaves before Jessica arrives; she reads the note; however, through a misunderstanding, Nathan believes Jessica is with Kenneth. Nathan goes home and contemplates hanging himself in his room. Just as he dismisses the idea, Grace enters and knocks the chair over Nathan is standing on, causing him to be hanged. Grace returns to the church and performs a ritual from the book, which brings Nathan back to life. The ritual seems to have gone well, despite Nathan not remembering what happened, however Father Cornelius soon warns Grace that the book was damaged and those who are resurrected by it have the urge to eat human flesh. At school, Nathan hears Kenneth lying about what happened with Jessica the previous night to Samson and another friend, Shane. As Jessica attempts to ask Nathan out, he turns her down, thinking what Kenneth said was true. As the day progresses, Nathan slowly succumbs to the symptoms of the book. At night, everyone heads to a school disco, where Nathan soon becomes more zombie-like and bites Samson before returning home. As Samson becomes a zombie, he attacks Shane and infects him. Jessica goes to Nathan's house to sort things out, but Nathan warns Jessica away from him, realising something is wrong with him. The next morning, Grace tells Nathan what happened. Nathan realises that Samson is infected and tries to get the police to help capture him, but he is ignored. Returning home, Grace locks Nathan in the garage and starts to search for something to help him recover. Meanwhile, Charlotte has also become a zombie and infects Kenneth. Cheryl and Glenda go to a local bar, where they witness a zombie attack. Henry and Diggs also witness a zombie attack in the video shop. Henry and Diggs hide, and see that most of the town have been infected. They phone Jessica and tell her to lock herself inside her house. Henry and Diggs travel to Nathan's house and free him, before setting off to Jessica's. However, on their way they crash their car and have to continue on foot. Jessica is attacked by zombies in her house, including Samson, but she overpowers them and manages to escape. Grace goes to the church, but is attacked by Father Cornelius. He is soon bitten by a snake in the crypt, revealing the snake's venom is the cure to the infection. She takes the snake and leaves. Outside, Cheryl and Glenda are hiding in the graveyard. They encounter the infected Charlotte who bites Glenda, allowing Cheryl to get away. Nathan finds Jessica in a barn beside her house, where Jessica tells Nathan that she never did anything with Kenneth. Meanwhile, Henry and Diggs arrive at Jessica's house, followed by Cheryl who is being chased by a group of zombies. They hide in a cupboard in the house until night time when they try to escape. As they go outside they are saved by Nathan, however a group of zombies close in on them, but Jessica manages to kill them with the aid of a tractor. The survivors hide in the barn, but Samson and Shane get in and infect Cheryl. The others manage to escape to a platform, but are now trapped. They pour gasoline onto the barn floor, before Grace arrives with the snake. However, the snake escapes and the zombies begin to attack Grace. Nathan saves Grace, allowing her to escape, and also kills Samson. Nathan soon completely succumbs to the ritual, and becomes a zombie. As he is about to attack his friends, the snake bites him. The zombies quickly attack Nathan and he is caught in the fire that Jessica has ignited. Jessica, Diggs and Henry leave, and soon discover Nathan survived the fire, who finally asks Jessica to go out with him, to which she answers yes.

The expressions involved are usually grammatically singular terms. So, substitution of co-referential expressions into an opaque context does not always preserve truth. For example, \\"Lois believes x is a hero\\" is an opaque context because \\"Lois believes Superman is a hero\\" is true while \\"Lois believes Clark Kent is a hero\\" is false, even though 'Superman' and 'Clark Kent' are co-referential expressions. Usage The term is used in philosophical theories of reference, and is to be contrasted with referentially transparent context. In rough outline: *Opacity: \\"Mary believes that Cicero is a great orator\\" gives rise to an opaque context; although Cicero was also called 'Tully', we can't simply substitute 'Tully' for 'Cicero' in this context (\\"Mary believes that Tully is a great orator\\") and guarantee the same truth value, for Mary might not know that the names 'Tully' and 'Cicero' refer to one and the same thing. Of course, if Mary does believe that Cicero is a great orator, then there is a sense in which Mary believes that Tully is a great orator, even if she does not know that 'Tully' and 'Cicero' corefer. It is the sense forced on us by \\"direct reference\\" theories of proper names, i.e. those that maintain that the meaning of a proper name just is its referent. *Transparency: \\"Cicero was a Roman orator\\" gives rise to a transparent context; there is no problem substituting 'Tully' for 'Cicero' here: \\"Tully was a Roman orator\\". Both sentences necessarily express the same thing if 'Cicero' and 'Tully' refer to the same person. Note that this element is missing in the opaque contexts, where a shift in the name can result in a sentence that expresses something different from the original. Similar usage of the term applies for artificial languages such as programming languages and logics. The Cicero‚ÄìTully example above can be easily adapted. Use the notation [t] as a quotation that mentions a term t. Define a predicate L which is true for terms six letters long. Then [x] induces an opaque context, or is referentially opaque, because L([Cicero]) is true while L([Tully]) is false. Programming languages often have richer semantics than logics' semantics of truth and falsity, and so an operator such as [x] may fail to be referentially transparent for other reasons as well.

Occupying of south Belfast, the gardens are popular with office workers, students and tourists. They are located on Stranmillis Road in Queen's Quarter, with Queen's University nearby. The Ulster Museum is located at the main entrance. History The gardens opened in 1828 as the private Royal Belfast Botanical Gardens. It continued as a private park for many years, only opening to members of the public on Sundays prior to 1895. Then it became a public park in 1895 when the Belfast Corporation bought the gardens from the Belfast Botanical and Horticultural Society. The Belfast Corporation was the predecessor of Belfast City Council, the present owner. The Palm House The gardens' most notable feature is the Palm House conservatory. The foundation stone was laid by the Marquess of Donegall in 1839 and work was completed in 1840. It is one of the earliest examples of a curvilinear cast iron glasshouses in the world. Designed by Charles Lanyon and built by Richard Turner, Belfast's Palm House predates the glasshouses at Kew and the Irish National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin, both of which Turner went on to build. The Palm House consists of two wings, the cool wing and the tropical wing. Lanyon altered his original plans to increase the height of the latter wing's dome, allowing for much taller plants. In the past these have included an 11 metre tall globe spear lily. The lily, which is native to Australia, finally bloomed in March 2005 after a 23-year wait. The Palm House also features a 400-year-old Xanthorrhoea. Image:Plaque in Palm House.jpg|Plaque in three languages Image:Early Spring.JPG|Early spring flowers Image:Urn, Palm House.JPG|Urn Image:Aloe Saponaria.jpg|Aloe saponaria Other features The gardens contain another glasshouse, the Tropical Ravine House. Built by head gardener Charles McKimm in 1889, it features a unique design. A sunken ravine runs the length of the building, with a balcony at each side for viewing. The most popular attraction is the Dombeya, which flowers every February. The Palm House and the Tropical Ravine House were symbols of Belfast's growing industrial might and prosperity in the Victorian era and attracted over 10,000 visitors a day. The gardens also feature one of the longest herbaceous borders in the UK and Ireland. There is also a rose garden built in 1932 and various species of tree, including the hornbeam-oak. A statue of Lord Kelvin stands at the Stranmillis Road entrance.

CCTV captures Spector's presence there on the same Saturday as one of his victims, Sarah Kay, whose sister tells the police the siblings met there weekly. Indeed, by eavesdropping on the sisters' conversation at the park that day (in series 1), Spector learns Sarah Kay has not changed her back door locks, which knowledge he uses to his advantage.

Life Yan Xing was from Jincheng Commandery (), which is around present-day Yuzhong County, Gansu. He started his career as a military officer under the warlord Han Sui. When conflict broke out between Han Sui and another warlord Ma Teng, Yan Xing engaged Ma Teng's eldest son Ma Chao in a fight and nearly killed him by piercing him with a spear; the shaft broke so the tip only grazed Ma Chao's head. In 209, Han Sui sent him as an emissary to meet the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian. Cao Cao treated Yan Xing well and appointed him as the Administrator () of Jianwei Commandery (ÁäçÁÇ∫ÈÉ°; around present-day Meishan, Sichuan). Yan Xing received permission to bring his family to the imperial capital, Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan), after which he returned to Han Sui. He advised Han Sui to become a vassal under Cao Cao and send one of his sons to Xu as a \\"hostage\\", so as to express his loyalty to the central government. Although Han Sui was initially reluctant to do so, he eventually agreed and sent his family to Xu as hostages. In 211, when Ma Chao and other warlords in the Guanzhong region were planning to start a rebellion, they approached Han Sui and invited him to join them. Ma Chao even told Han Sui, \\"Previously, Zhong Yao ordered me to harm you. Now, I know that the people from Guandong (east of Tong Pass) cannot be trusted. Now, I abandon my father, and I'm willing to acknowledge you as my father. You should also abandon your son, and treat me like your son.\\" Yan Xing advised Han Sui not to cooperate with Ma Chao but Han Sui still agreed to the alliance.(ÂèäÁ¥ÑÈÇÑÔºåË∂ÖË¨ÇÁ¥ÑÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂâçÈçæÂè∏Èö∏‰ªªË∂Ö‰ΩøÂèñÂ∞áËªçÔºåÈóúÊù±‰∫∫‰∏çÂèØË§á‰ø°‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäË∂ÖÊ£ÑÁà∂Ôºå‰ª•Â∞áËªçÁÇ∫Áà∂ÔºåÂ∞áËªç‰∫¶Áï∂Ê£ÑÂ≠êÔºå‰ª•Ë∂ÖÁÇ∫Â≠ê„ÄÇ„ÄçË°åË´´Á¥ÑÔºå‰∏çÊ¨≤‰ª§ËàáË∂ÖÂêà„ÄÇÁ¥ÑË¨ÇË°åÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ªäË´∏Â∞á‰∏çË¨ÄËÄåÂêåÔºå‰ººÊúâÂ§©Êï∏„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÊù±Ë©£ËèØÈô∞„ÄÇ) Weilue annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 15. Ma Chao, Han Sui and the warlords then engaged Cao Cao at the Battle of Tong Pass. During the battle, when Cao Cao requested to meet Han Sui, an old acquaintance of his, for a chat, Yan Xing accompanied Han Sui to the meeting. Cao Cao pointed at Yan Xing and told Han Sui, \\"Take good care of this filial son.\\" After Cao Cao defeated the warlords at the Battle of Tong Pass, Han Sui and his remaining followers retreated to Jincheng Commandery. As Cao Cao had heard that Yan Xing was reluctant to participate in the rebellion, he spared Yan Xing's family members who were in Xu at the time but executed the families of the other rebels. He then wrote a letter to Yan Xing to inform him that even though his family members were alive and well, the central government could not permanently provide for them. When Han Sui found out that Cao Cao had spared Yan Xing's family members, he plotted to harm them so as to force Yan Xing to remain loyal to him. He then forced Yan Xing to marry his daughter. As Han Sui expected, Cao Cao became suspicious of Yan Xing. At the time, as Han Sui had ordered Yan Xing to take charge of Xiping Commandery (Ë•øÂπ≥ÈÉ°; around present-day Xining, Qinghai), Yan Xing seized the opportunity to gather his followers and turn against Han Sui. However, he never managed to defeat Han Sui so he gave up and brought along his followers to join Cao Cao's side. Cao Cao enfeoffed him as a marquis. Nothing was recorded in history about Yan Xing from this point onwards. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms References * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

A Catholic View, (SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006), both translated into Italian. He is fluent in Arabic. Early life and education Michael L. Fitzgerald was born in Walsall, United Kingdom, on 17 August 1937, into a Catholic family of Irish descent, and attended Queen Mary's Grammar School. Desiring from an early age to become a priest and a missionary, he joined the junior seminary of the Missionaries of Africa (White Fathers) at the age of twelve, first in Scotland, then in the South of England. He studied philosophy for two years, the first in England and the second in Ireland. He made his novitiate in the Netherlands from 1956 to 1957 and pursued his theological studies from 1957 to 1961 in Tunisia, where he began learning Arabic and acquiring some knowledge of Islam. Cardinal William Godfrey, Archbishop of Westminster, ordained him a priest of the Society of Missionaries of Africa (White Fathers) on 3 February 1961.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 1‚Äì2. Upon ordination in 1961 he was sent to Rome to study Dogmatic Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. Among his teachers was Jesuit theologian Bernard Lonergan. This was the time of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965) which provided the opportunity of attending lectures by theologians such as Karl Rahner and Yves Congar. He completed his doctorate in Theology in 1965 on the missionary intention in the writings of the Latin apologists. Scholar, teacher, and pastor In 1965 he started a BA in Arabic at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, graduating in 1968, whereupon he became a lecturer at the IPEA (Institut Pontifical d'√âtudes Arabes), later renamed the Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies (PISAI).Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 3‚Äì4. After one year lecturing at the PISAI, he was appointed lecturer in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Makerere, Kampala, Uganda, where he taught courses on Islam to Muslim as well as to Christian students. In 1971 he returned to Rome to pursue his teaching and scholarly interests at the PISAI. From 1972 to 1978 he was Director of the PISAI. During this period Fitzgerald was involved in the creation of Encounter, Documents for Christian-Muslim Understanding, a periodical publication on Islam, and supervised the launch of Islamochristiana, a scholarly journal specialised in Christian-Muslim relations and interreligious dialogue. In 1972 he became consultor of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, then known as Secretariat for Non-Christians. In 1978 he returned to Africa to carry out parish work in the Sudan, in the town of New Halfa (Archdiocese of Khartoum). His duties included ministering to the Christian population while also cooperating with the Muslim community. In 1980 he was elected to the General Council of the Missionaries of Africa in Rome, where he spent six years managing and organising.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 4‚Äì8. Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue In 1987 he was appointed Secretary of the Secretariat for Non-Christians, which was renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue (PCID) in 1988. In that capacity Fitzgerald helped draft Dialogue and Proclamation, one of the Catholic Church's documents concerning the relationship between dialogue and evangelisation. On 16 December 1991, Fitzgerald was appointed titular bishop of Nepte. He was consecrated at Saint Peter's Basilica by Pope John Paul II on 6 January 1992.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 8‚Äì10. On 1 October 2002, Pope John Paul named him to succeed Cardinal Francis Arinze as President of the PCID and gave him the rank of archbishop as well.Fitzgerald, Michael, Dieu r√™ve d'unit√©. Les catholiques et les religions: les le√ßons du dialogue. Entretien a avec Annie Laurent, Paris, Bayard Presse, 2005. p. 17. This made him the highest-ranking British citizen in the Roman Curia. Nuncio On 15 February 2006, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Egypt and Delegate to the League of Arab States, his first diplomatic posting. He was one of the few nuncios not to have attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. According to the BBC, \\"The decision by the German-born pontiff has caused a stir. Vatican-watchers are trying to work out whether the move is a demotion, or recognition of the special talents of the archbishop.\\" Fitzgerald said: \\"My background in Arabic and Islamic studies is probably considered useful at this moment for the development of relations with Egypt and the rest of the Islamic world.\\" One Vatican correspondent called Fitzgerald's reassignment \\"[t]he Pope's worst decision so far\\" and his absence was noted by the press when Pope Benedict offended Muslims with his Regensburg lecture in September 2006. Fitzgerald's transfer proved to be part of Benedict's restructuring of curial departments to reorient interreligious discussions with non-Christians by uniting the role of president of the PCID with that of the Pontifical Council for Culture, a restructuring that Benedict initiated in March 2006 and reversed in June 2007. He resigned from his position as nuncio in October 2012 Later career  In retirement he remained at the Missionaries of Africa in Jerusalem until early in 2019, when he returned to England to work in a Liverpool parish. On 1 September 2019, Pope Francis announced he would make him a cardinal. On 5 October 2019, Pope Francis made him Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Portico. Views on interreligious dialogue According to Fitzgerald, the impetus for interreligious dialogue in the Catholic Church stems from the Second Vatican Council, in particular the declaration Nostra Aetate ('In our Time') on relations with other religions, especially Judaism but also Islam. In conveying for the first time a positive assessment of other religious traditions, the declaration emphasises dialogue between people rather than systems.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, p. 28. In addition, dialogue is made necessary by the fact of religious plurality, and the increasing contact between people of different religions. The theological basis for both dialogue and evangelisation on the part of the Church is the Christian belief in God as love, and God's love for humankind.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, p. 86. Fitzgerald further argues that the aim of interreligious dialogue is not to produce a new world religion or to achieve some sort of theological unity between all religions. In this it differs radically from ecumenical dialogue conducted with the various Christian churches with a view to a unity of worship grounded on a unity of faith. Indeed, theological dialogue with followers of other religions, the 'dialogue of discourse', is especially difficult due to the divergence of beliefs, and requires participants with a thorough theological education, but such dialogue can serve to eliminate false problems. Other forms of dialogue are important, such as the dialogue of life, the dialogue of action and the dialogue of religious experience.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 38, 95, 140; Fitzgerald, Michael, Dieu r√™ve d'unit√©. Les catholiques et les religions: les le√ßons du dialogue. Entretiens avec Annie Laurent, Paris, Bayard Presse, 2005. p. 71. In practising dialogue one should show a spirit of openness and be prepared to learn from the other, but there should be no fear on the part of Christians to express their own convictions, and any semblance of syncretism and relativism ought to be avoided.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View, SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 34, 77; Fitzgerald, Michael, Dieu r√™ve d'unit√©. Les catholiques et les religions: les le√ßons du dialogue. Entretiens avec Annie Laurent, Paris, Bayard Presse, 2005. p. 79. While the pursuit of dialogue in the Catholic Church goes hand in hand with the proclamation of Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, as stated in Dialogue and Proclamation, the 'Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy' in other religions (Nostra Aetate, 2), and indeed among the benefits of interreligious dialogue is a mutual enrichment, and a deeper knowledge of one's own religion.Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, Interfaith Dialogue.

The coastline of the Catlins is notoriously dangerous, and there have been many shipwrecks in the region. The most notable of these, and also one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters, was the wreck of the passenger steamer Tararua, en route from Port Chalmers to Melbourne via Bluff, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard. Waipapa Point lies in the far southwest of the Catlins. A lighthouse was built on the point in response to the tragedy; it began operating in 1884. With its sibling, the retired Kaipara North Head lighthouse, this was one of the last two wooden lighthouses built in New Zealand. It is still active, and was automated in 1976.

The company was founded in 1973 by Peter Watts, who organised a rail journey through British Rail from Severnside to the Cambrian coast. The company organises tours for both rail enthusiasts, and general tours to places of interest. After British Rail's demise the company operated in conjunction with several spot-hire companies, most notably E.W.S., FM Rail and Direct Rail Services, who provided locomotives, and Riviera Trains, who provided rolling stock. This relationship was solidified in 2006, when Riviera Trains purchased the parent company of Pathfinder Tours. A new company named Pathfinder Tours (2006) Ltd was formed to continue operating railtours with the exclusive use of Riviera's supply of rolling stock. Although it will primarily use DB Schenker and Direct Rail Services locomotives, occasionally a preserved locomotive will be chartered from one of the major preservation organisations (notably the Class 40 Preservation Society, Diesel Traction Group, the Deltic Preservation Society or the A1 Trust). The company also acts as a booking agent for other companies such as A1 Trust and sister company Torbay Express Ltd.

Sandperches are benthic fish which normally occur over sand or rubble substrates in shallow seas. They are found off the coasts of South America, South Africa and in the Indo-Pacific as far east as Japan. The family contains a few species which are used by humans for food. Characteristics Some sandperches resemble wrasse in that they possess long dorsal and anal fins which may have a few spines and enlarged lips that appear to curl back with big canine teeth in the front of the jaws. They have elongated bodies which are flattened posteriorly and cylindrical towards the head. The body usually patterned with spots and bands, The eyes are positioned near top of head. They are relatively small in size, normally in length. These fish tend to sit on the sea bed, their bodies propped up by the widely separated pelvic fins. Some of the members of the speciose genus Parapercis, maybe all of them, are sequential hermaphrodites, all being female at sexual maturity and later changing into males which frequently have significantly different colourings and markings. Genera The family Pinguipedidae contains seven genera with a total of 65 species. The genera are: * Kochichthys Kamohara, 1961 * Parapercis Bleeker, 1863 * Pinguipes Cuvier in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1829 * Prolatilus Gill, 1865 * Pseudopercis Miranda Ribeiro, 1903 * Ryukyupercis Imamura & Yoshino, 2007. * Simipercis Johnson & Randall 2006.

Its primary mission was as a radar complex. It was closed on 30 June 1988 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the radar installation that was the main part of the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-02. History Fort Fisher during the American Civil War was a Confederate States of America stronghold that fell to Union forces on January 15, 1865 during the Second Battle of Fort Fisher. \\"Fort Fisher\\" had earthworks for the fort's land face, known as Shepard's Battery. In World War II, the nearby December 1940 Camp Davis had 5 live anti- aircraft ranges, including one named for Fort Fisher and which became the main AA range for the camp.Camp Davis used a World War II range at Fort Fisher‚Äîthe camp was built in late December 1940 as an Army anti-aircraft artillery training facility, and the camp had ~20,000 officers and men of the First Army, Fourth Corps Area using more than 3,000 buildings on and new railroad spurs into the camp. Camp Davis' 4 other live anti-aircraft ranges were outside of the main post along the southern coast of North Carolina at Sears Point, New Topsail Inlet, Maple Hill, and Holly Shelter. The Fort Fisher range became the main range for Camp Davis and then was used for a United States Army Air Forces airfield. Fort Fisher AAF Fort Fisher Army Airfield (Fort Fisher AAF) was established at the Fort Fisher anti-aircraft range and included construction of 48 frame buildings, 316 tent frames, showers and latrines, mess halls, warehouses, radio and meteorological stations, a post exchange, photo lab, recreation hall, outdoor theater, guardhouse, infirmary, and an administration building. The site had a 10,000-gallon water storage tank, a motor pool, a large parade ground, three steel observation towers along the beach, and a unpaved runway (the Shepard's Battery earthworks were leveled for the runway.) Today, the parking lot and visitor center for Fort Fisher sit on the remains of the runway. When Camp Davis closed in 1944, Fort Fisher AAF had an 80-seat cafeteria, a 350-bed hospital and dental clinic, and covered an area of several hundred acres. Fort Fisher AFS Fort Fisher Air Force Station was opened in 1955 on part of the Fort Fisher AAF installation as USAF Permanent System radar station \\"M-115\\" during a $1 billion increase for US continental defenseLeonard, Vol I. 1945-1955, p. 66 after Hq USAF approved the Mobile Radar program in mid-1954.Grant It was assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC) as part of a planned deployment of forty-four Mobile radar stations. Fort Fisher AFS was designed as site M-115 and the 701st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned on 1 August 1955.Cornett & Johnson, p.162 ADC initially installed AN/MPS-7 and AN/MPS-8 radars at the site, and initially the station functioned as a Ground control intercept (GCI) and warning station to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the squadron's radar scopes. By 1958 the AN/MPS-8 had been converted into an AN/GPS-3 and an AN/MPS-14 had been added. In 1962 an AN/FPS-7C and AN/FPS-26 were placed in operation along with the AN/MPS-14 radars. During 1962 Fort Fisher AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-04 at Fort Lee AFS, Virginia. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 701st Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 July 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-115. The station was supported logistically by nearby Myrtle Beach Air Force Base South Carolina. SLBM surveillance The Fort Fisher AFS AN/FPS-26 radar was converted to an Avco AN/FSS-7 SLBM Detection Radar that was operated by Detachment 5, 14th Missile Warning Squadron, Fourteenth Aerospace Force as part of the Avco 474N SLBM Detection and Warning System that \\"became operational in Mid-1972\\".Leonard, Vol II, 1955-1972, p. 226reference 3 In addition to the main facility, Fort Fisher AFS operated several unmanned Gap Filler sites: * Myrtle Beach, SC (M-115A/Z-115A): * Fort Bragg, NC (M-115B/Z-115B): Myrtle Beach operated an AN/FPS-14, while Fort Bragg operated an AN/FPS-18. In addition, with the closure of ADC facilities at MCAS Cherry Point (M-116), the AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler at Holly Ridge, NC was redesignated Z-115C in 1963.

He was released to serve King Edward I of England's expedition in Flanders in 1297.Murison, p. 117 Fraser was made a household knight - effectively, a member of the royal bodyguard - and gifted a horse by Edward before the Battle of Falkirk. Fraser was thus among the English cavalry divisions that defeated the army of William Wallace. On 27 March 1299, in recognition of his good service, he was restored his lands and titles. He was the Keeper of Selkirk Forest, and was at the Siege of Caerlaverock on the side of the English in 1300. He switched to the Scottish side in mid-1301 and led the Scottish victory at the Battle of Roslin in 1303, alongside John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch (also known as \\"Red Comyn\\"). Here Fraser killed Ralph Manton, an English treasury clerk, whom Fraser accused of embezzling King Edward of funds and neglecting to pay Fraser's wages when he was in English service. Consequently, the English King Edward I, marched north through Stirling taking Perth. As Edward approached Dunfermline, the Bishop of St Andrews and the bishop of Glasgow along with Red Comyn met his army and submitted. Fraser refused to swear fealty to the English King and did not attend. In March 1304, Fraser and Wallace were ambushed by English forces at the Action at Happrew and defeated. By June Fraser had deserted Wallace and accepted Edward's peace terms. In January 1305 he was employed, along with all other Scottish knights, to hunt down his former comrade Wallace. In March 1306 Fraser once again broke faith with King Edward and defected to Robert the Bruce. He escaped from the defeat at the Battle of Methven, but was captured during the summer of 1306 at a subsequent engagement at Kirkencliff near Stirling by Sir Thomas de Multon and Sir John Jose. King Edward had commanded all captured supporters of King Robert executed and, in particular, the lands of Simon Fraser harried and burnt.

Pammal Municipality  Pammal Municipality covers the entire area of Pammal and Nagalkeni. Pammal Municipality is considered a Green Municipality and was the first Municipality in the city awarded with a Zero Waste Municipality tag. Underground Sewage System (Underground Drainage) now extended to Pammal and Anakaputhur Municipalities. Work has already been started to upgrade the existing sewerage system into the UGD system. Metro Water services also extended to Pammal under Pallavaram ‚Äì Pammal Metro Water Scheme. The work for metro water services also has started and currently in progress.  Transportation  The Chennai International Airport is 2 km from Pammal, and Pammal bus stand is located between Pallavaram and Kundrathur, linking Pallavaram and Poonamallee. Pammal is served by Pallavaram Railway Station on the Chennai Beach - Chengalpattu section of Chennai Suburban Railway Network. State Highway 113A (SH-113A) Pallavaram - Kundrathur - Poonamallee Road runs through Pammal, it is popularly known as Pammal Main Road. Currently, the neighborhoods of Pammal and Pallavaram are served by the Chennai Airport Metro Station of the Chennai Metro Rail Limited(CMRL) network. CMRL feeder services are also available from Chennai Airport Metro Station to Pammal Bus Stop. The proposed Airport - Kilambakkam metro extension of Blue Line will introduce Pallavaram Metro Station to serve Pallavaram and Pammal. The Airport - Kilambakkam Metro Line was originally planned with a route via Pallavaram, Pammal, Thiruneermalai Service Road, and then Tambaram and straight along the GST road up to Vandalur Kilambakkam. Later CMRL decided to follow the route through the GST Road from Airport to Kilambakkam via Pallavaram, Tambaram and Vandalur which involved less land acquisition, was easier to construct and was expected to have more patronage. As part of the plan for the Chennai Mono Rail, there was a plan for a route between Vandalur and Puzhal via Pallavaram, Pammal, Kundrathur, Mangadu, Kumanan Chavadi, and Poonamallee High Road to reach Puzhal. Recently, CMRL announced feasibility for a Chennai Light Rail project between Tambaram and Velachery. After completion of the CMRL Phase I Extension from Airport to Kilambakkam and CMRL Phase II extension from Light House to Poonamallee, there will be a Chennai Light Rail connection between Pallavaram and Poonamallee via Pammal, Anakaputhur, and Kundrathur.

The story was also collected in the omnibus volume Three Trumps (Viking 1955). This book and the pre-war novel Over My Dead Body both involve international intrigue over Montenegro, but under very different circumstances, first concerning Nazi designs on the Balkans, and later in the context of Tito's Yugoslavia. Plot introduction Montenegro is a name that means \\"black mountain\\" in many Romance languages. The native name for the place is Crna Gora. The origin of the name 'Black Mountain' is still a matter of debate among historians. In The Black Mountain, Nero Wolfe's oldest friend and fellow Montenegrin Marko Vukcic is murdered by a Yugoslavian agent who has already made his escape from New York. Without hesitation, Wolfe is compelled to go back to his homeland to avenge Marko's death and bring the killer back to American justice; this desire is intensified by the news that Carla Britten, Wolfe's adopted daughter, has also been killed. As they covertly negotiate through one of the most dangerous places on earth, Archie sees Wolfe as the man of action he used to be, and gets a little culture-shock: In these strange lands, Nero replaces Archie as the expert operator. In Over My Dead Body (1940), Wolfe plays a part in impeding the control of Bosnia and Croatia by Nazi Germany. In The Black Mountain, Marko's nephew is part of a subversive group to gain Montenegro's independence from Yugoslavia. In 1953, such a concept was unrealistic, but supported by the guerrilla formations of komite and Zelena≈°i. Montenegro became an independent republic in 2006. Plot As Archie is about to leave the brownstone for a basketball game, Sergeant Purley Stebbins calls with news that Wolfe's old friend Marko Vukcic has been shot and killed. After Archie identifies the body, Wolfe joins him at the morgue and insists on being taken first to the crime scene and then Rusterman's Restaurant, owned by Marko. Wolfe and Inspector Cramer question the employees there, and Wolfe and Archie return to the brownstone to find a surprise visitor: Wolfe's adopted daughter Carla. She and Marko have been involved in a movement to secure Montenegro's independence from Yugoslavia, and she is furious at Wolfe's refusal to support the effort. Wolfe tries to question her, but she is reluctant to give any information, since she believes that he may be in league with the government of Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union. During the three weeks following the murder, Wolfe pursues various lines of investigation and gets a second visit from Carla, enraged that the police are now looking into the movement's background. Following this meeting, he gets three updates from Paolo Telesio, an informant in Bari, Italy. The first states that Carla has returned to Bari and crossed the Adriatic Sea into Montenegro; the second is a cryptic message on the killer's location - \\"the man you seek is within sight of the mountain\\"; the last states that Carla has been killed. Realizing that \\"the mountain\\" must be Lovƒáen in Montenegro, Wolfe makes immediate plans to go there and find Marko's killer, accompanied by Archie. The two fly to Europe, making their way to Bari and taking temporary shelter in a house owned by one of Telesio's friends. Telesio arranges for a guide to ferry them across the Adriatic; from there, the two hike through the foothills of Lovƒáen and eventually secure a ride to Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa and then Podgorica. Jub√© Bilic, a college student, drives them to Podgorica and drops them off at the office of Gospo Stritar, the local police chief. Wolfe passes himself off as a Montenegro native who has lived abroad for many years and is now returning to decide which side to support in the struggle over Yugoslavia's future, and Archie as his American- born son to explain his inability to speak Serbo-Croat. Although Stritar is skeptical of Wolfe's explanation, he allows the two to go about their business, but dispatches Jub√© to follow them. Wolfe and Archie travel to the home of Marko's nephew Danilo, who had passed the messages on to Telesio and who has been helping Marko and Carla smuggle weapons and supplies in from the United States. Danilo learns of Jub√©'s surveillance and has him killed, then reluctantly agrees to take Wolfe and Archie into the mountains for a meeting with Josip Pasic, one member of a guerrilla team in the independence movement. From Pasic, Wolfe learns that Carla had begun to suspect that a spy had infiltrated the group; she slipped into Albania to infiltrate a Russian- controlled fort and gather information, only to be killed instead. Wolfe and Archie sneak into the fort, where they hear screams coming from one room. Inside, they discover Peter Zov, a man they had previously seen in Stritar's office, being tortured by three Russians. Their leader berates Zov for going to New York and killing Marko on Stritar's orders, hampering Russia's goal of taking over Yugoslavia if the Tito regime is overthrown. Carla had gained the favor of the other two Russians; when they realized who she was, they killed her. Wolfe and Archie storm the room, and Archie kills the Russians and frees Zov. The gun he used to kill Marko is found elsewhere in the fort, and Wolfe makes up his mind to take him back to New York to face justice rather than exact revenge immediately. Once the three have returned to Podgorica, Wolfe pretends to have decided to commit himself to the Tito regime and offers Stritar a large bribe in support of it. Stritar produces a letter (a fake sent by Telesio) which states that Wolfe will be remaining in New York and sending funds to support the independence movement. Zov is dispatched to assassinate him as an associate of Marko. The three return to Italy, where Wolfe and Archie arrange a trans-Atlantic ship voyage under their assumed names and Zov comes aboard as a steward. Wolfe insists on having Zov brought to the brownstone so that he can reveal himself on the spot. When the ship pulls into the New York harbor, though, a news photographer spots Wolfe on the deck and calls his name. Zov draws his gun and shoots Wolfe, wounding him in the leg before being tackled by the rest of the staff. Satisfied that both murders can now be closed, Wolfe tells Archie to call Cramer.

A descendant of Deng Yu, Deng Zhi started his career in the late Eastern Han dynasty under the warlord Liu Bei as a low-level officer in Pi County. After Liu Bei discovered his talent, Deng Zhi steadily rose through the ranks to become a county prefect and later a commandery administrator and imperial secretary. In 223, the Shu regent Zhuge Liang sent him as Shu's envoy to meet Sun Quan, the ruler of Shu's ally state Wu, and reestablish the Wu‚ÄìShu alliance against their common rival state Wei. Deng Zhi succeeded in his mission and earned praise from Sun Quan for strengthening Wu‚ÄìShu ties. In 227, Deng Zhi became a military general and he participated in the first Shu invasion of Wei by leading a decoy force with Zhao Yun to distract the Wei general Cao Zhen. Although they lost the battle, Deng Zhi and Zhao Yun managed to rally their troops to put up a firm defence during their retreat and minimise their losses. Following Zhuge Liang's death in 234, Deng Zhi rose to higher general ranks and was stationed in present-day Chongqing for about 10 years before he was recalled back to the Shu capital Chengdu in his 70s to serve as General of Chariots and Cavalry. In 248, he suppressed a rebellion in Fuling (around present-day Pengshui County, Chongqing). He died in 251. Early life Deng Zhi was born in the late Eastern Han dynasty in Xinye County (Êñ∞ÈáéÁ∏£), Yiyang Commandery (Áæ©ÈôΩÈÉ°), which is present-day Xinye County, Henan. He was a descendant of Deng Yu, a general who served under Emperor Guangwu in the early Eastern Han dynasty.(ÈÑßËäùÂ≠ó‰ºØËãóÔºåÁæ©ÈôΩÊñ∞Èáé‰∫∫ÔºåÊº¢Âè∏ÂæíÁ¶π‰πãÂæå‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 45. Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Deng Zhi migrated to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), where he did not receive as much recognition from the locals as he expected. He then decided to consult Zhang Yu, a low-ranking official in Yi Province who was also a famous fortune teller. Zhang Yu told him: \\"Sir, once you are above the age of 70, you will rise to the position of General-in-Chief and will receive a peerage as a marquis.\\"(Êº¢Êú´ÂÖ•ËúÄÔºåÊú™Ë¶ãÁü•ÂæÖ„ÄÇÊôÇÁõäÂ∑ûÂæû‰∫ãÂºµË£ïÂñÑÁõ∏ÔºåËäùÂæÄÂæû‰πãÔºåË£ïË¨ÇËäùÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂêõÂπ¥ÈÅé‰∏ÉÂçÅÔºå‰ΩçËá≥Â§ßÂ∞áËªçÔºåÂ∞Å‰æØ„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 45.

Service under Liu Bei In 214, after the warlord Liu Bei seized control of Yi Province from the provincial governor Liu Zhang, Deng Zhi was appointed as a low-level officer in charge of the granary in Pi County. One day, when Liu Bei visited Pi County, he spoke to Deng Zhi and discovered his talent. He was so impressed with Deng Zhi that he appointed Deng Zhi as the Prefect of Pi County, and later promoted him to the position of Administrator of Guanghan Commandery (Âª£Êº¢ÈÉ°; around present-day Guanghan, Sichuan).(ÂÖà‰∏ªÂÆöÁõäÂ∑ûÔºåËäùÁÇ∫ÈÉ´ÈÇ∏Èñ£Áù£„ÄÇÂÖà‰∏ªÂá∫Ëá≥ÈÉ´ÔºåËàáË™ûÔºåÂ§ßÂ•á‰πãÔºåÊì¢ÁÇ∫ÈÉ´‰ª§ÔºåÈÅ∑Âª£Êº¢Â§™ÂÆà„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 45. After the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty in 220, Liu Bei declared himself emperor in May 221 and established the state of Shu to challenge the legitimacy of the state of Wei, which replaced the Eastern Han dynasty. Around this time, due to his good performance in office, Deng Zhi was reassigned from Guanghan Commandery to the Shu capital, Chengdu, to serve as a Master of Writing (Â∞öÊõ∏) in the imperial secretariat.(ÊâÄÂú®Ê∏ÖÂö¥ÊúâÊ≤ªÁ∏æÔºåÂÖ•ÁÇ∫Â∞öÊõ∏„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 45. As Shu's envoy to Wu Between August 221 and October 222, Liu Bei went to war with his former ally Sun Quan, who broke their alliance in 219 by seizing Liu Bei's territories in southern Jing Province and executing Guan Yu, one of Liu Bei's top generals. However, he ended up suffering a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Xiaoting against Sun Quan's forces. Before Liu Bei died in June 223, Sun Quan sought to make peace with him after the Battle of Xiaoting. In response, Liu Bei had sent Song Wei (ÂÆãÁëã) and Fei Yi as his representatives to meet Sun Quan and agree on a truce.(ÂÖà‰∏ªËñ®ÊñºÊ∞∏ÂÆâ„ÄÇÂÖàÊòØÔºåÂê≥ÁéãÂ≠´Ê¨äË´ãÂíåÔºåÂÖà‰∏ªÁ¥ØÈÅ£ÂÆãÁëã„ÄÅË≤ªÁ¶ïÁ≠âËàáÁõ∏Â†±ËçÖ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 45. Following Liu Bei's death, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, became regent to Liu Bei's son and successor Liu Shan as Liu Shan was still underage at the time.

He was also appointed as the nominal Inspector of Yan Province as Yan Province was not Shu territory. In addition, he was enfeoffed as a village marquis under the title \\"Marquis of Yangwu Village\\" (ÈôΩÊ≠¶‰∫≠‰æØ).

He also led a frugal and simple life as he relied solely on his official salary and government-issued items for his basic needs. When he became General of the Vanguard, his salary increased substantially and even far greater as General of Chariots and Cavalry but this increase of income was mostly used to pay off debts and support his family and relatives. As he owned no private property throughout his life, his family often struggled to make ends meet and they had no excess wealth at the time of his death.(Ë∫´‰πãË°£È£üË≥á‰ª∞ÊñºÂÆòÔºå‰∏çËãüÁ¥†ÂÑâÔºåÁÑ∂ÁµÇ‰∏çÊ≤ªÁßÅÁî¢ÔºåÂ¶ªÂ≠ê‰∏çÂÖçÈ•ëÂØíÔºåÊ≠ª‰πãÊó•ÂÆ∂ÁÑ°È§òË≤°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 45. Deng Zhi was also known for being firm and candid, and direct when he expressed his thoughts and feelings.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Deng Zhi is a minor character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. His first trip to Wu as Shu's envoy in the year 223 is dramatised and exaggerated in Chapter 86. When Deng Zhi shows up in Wu, Zhang Zhao suggests to the Wu king Sun Quan to intimidate Deng Zhi and boil him alive (in the same way the King of Qi executed Li Yiji) if he tries to lobby them to make peace with Shu.([Âºµ]Êò≠Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂÖàÊñºÊÆøÂâçÁ´ã‰∏ÄÂ§ßÈºéÔºåË≤ØÊ≤πÊï∏ÁôæÊñ§Ôºå‰∏ãÁî®ÁÇ≠Ááí„ÄÇÂæÖÂÖ∂Ê≤πÊ≤∏ÔºåÂèØÈÅ∏Ë∫´Èï∑Èù¢Â§ßÊ≠¶Â£´‰∏ÄÂçÉ‰∫∫ÔºåÂêÑÂü∑ÂàÄÂú®ÊâãÔºåÂæûÂÆÆÈñÄÂâçÁõ¥ÊéíËá≥ÊÆø‰∏äÔºåÂçªÂñöËäùÂÖ•Ë¶ã„ÄÇ‰ºëÁ≠âÊ≠§‰∫∫ÈñãË®Ä‰∏ãË™™Ë©ûÔºåË≤¨‰ª•ÈÖàÈ£üÂÖ∂Ë™™ÈΩäÊïÖ‰∫ãÔºåÊïàÊ≠§‰æãÁÉπ‰πãÔºåÁúãÂÖ∂‰∫∫Â¶Ç‰ΩïÂ∞çÁ≠î„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguo Yanyi ch. 86.

BBC career Harvey began his BBC television career in Bristol working in production, before trying his hand as a news reporter in 1975, then moving on to the launch of breakfast television in Britain: Breakfast Time on BBC One. From there he went on to present the One O'Clock, Six O'Clock News and flagship Nine O'Clock News on BBC One. From national news, he moved to become a presenter on South Today, the BBC's regional news service for the Southampton region, as well as having presented on BBC Points West in the Bristol region, and also presented nationally once more, on BBC News. ITV He left the BBC eventually to become a presenter on the ITV News Channel produced by ITN, where he first presented the breakfast programme with Lucy Alexander before moving to his own programme after breakfast in the daily schedule Live with Andrew Harvey.

In storage at the American Precision Museum Etheric force is a term Thomas Edison coined to describe a phenomenon later understood as high frequency electromagnetic waves‚Äîeffectively, radio. Edison believed it was the mysterious force that some believed pervaded the ether. At the end of 1875, Edison and his assistants were experimenting with the Acoustic Telegraph when they noticed that a rapidly vibrating spark gap produced a spark in an adjacent relay.Wills, Ian. 2009. Edison and science: A curious result. Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 40 (June):157-166 Subsequent investigation showed that the phenomenon could be made to occur at a distance of several feet without interconnecting cables. Edison, with this small amount of evidence, announced that it was \\"a true unknown force\\" Israel, Paul B. 1998. Edison: A life of invention. New York: John Wiley. p.111 since he believed that the spark transmitted electricity without carrying any charge. Edison concluded that this discovery had the potential to cheapen telegraphic communication and to allow transatlantic cables to be laid without insulation. He was also interested in finding new forces as a means for providing scientific explanations for spiritualist, occult and other allegedly supernatural phenomena following his disenchantment with Helena Blavatsky's Theosophy. Edison's apparatus consisted of a spark gap vibrating at a high frequency powered by batteries and connected to tin foil sheet about 12 by 8 inches, effectively acting as an antenna. A similar tin foil sheet, connected to ground was located at about eight feet away with two more similar, un- grounded tin foil sheets between. Sparks could be seen at the \\"receiver\\" sheets. Effectively, Edison had observed wireless transmission and was later to regret that he had not pursued it. Edison's last laboratory notebook entry on etheric force in 1875, which shows his experimental apparatus, can be seen at The Edison Papers. Controversy Thomas Edison announced the discovery, which he called etheric force, to the press and reports began to appear in Newark newspapers from November 29, 1875. While etheric force initially met with an enthusiastic reception, sceptics began to question whether it truly was a new phenomenon or merely a consequence of some already known phenomenon such as electromagnetic induction. Leaders among the doubters were James Ashley, editor of the Telegrapher, the inventor Elihu Thomson and Edwin Houston, a high school teacher with whom Thomson had studied. Thomson and Houston conducted a series of careful experiments where they discovered that the sparks actually carried a charge, and they announced their results, not in the popular press as Edison had done, but in a scientific journal, the Journal of the Franklin Institute. This prompted a reply from Edison, more experiments and more scientific papers. Nevertheless, Edison found support from a fellow diner at Delmonico's: George Miller Beard had experimented with electrophysiology, and enthusiastically promoted Edison's new force, most significantly in the pages of Scientific American.George Miller Beard (22 January 1876) \\"The Nature of the Newly Discovered Force\\", Scientific AmericanNiel Baldwin (2001) Edison: Inventing the Century, pages 64,5, University of Chicago Press Scepticism is not easily explained on scientific grounds as James Clerk Maxwell had predicted such waves in 1864 (confirmed by Heinrich Hertz in 1889).Hertz, Heinrich. 1893. Electric waves: being researches on the propagation of electric action with finite velocity through space. Reprint, New York: Dover (1962) Available from http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi- bin/cul.cdl/docviewer?did=cdl334&view;=50&frames;=0&seq;=5. The negative reception is perhaps better understood as a result of Edison's uneasy relationship with the professional scientific community.Hounshell, David A. 1980. Edison and the pure science ideal in 19th-century America. Science 207 (4431):612-617. Eventually the controversy increased to the point where Edison was pressured by his principal financial backers, Western Union, to desist from etheric force research and publicity over it, and to devote himself to what Western Union saw as more commercially viable projects. Edison abandoned work despite having been able to send signals twenty to thirty feet. He also drafted, but did not file, a patent application for an \\"etheric telegraph\\" before he abandoned etheric force. Later development In 1885 Edison again took up investigation of transmission by spark while working on a railway telegraph system and was able to get transmission of five hundred feet.Israel, Paul B. 1998. Edison: A life of invention. New York: John Wiley. p.239 Edison thought it might be suitable for ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore communication, taking out a patentEdison, Thomas A. 1885. Means for transmitting signals electrically. US patent 465,971 filed 23 May 1885, and issued 29 December 1891. for the system. Edison did not develop the patent commercially but according to his former assistant Francis Jehl, sold it to Guglielmo Marconi who developed it into radio.Jehl, Francis. 1937.

In an extended sense, it is also a primary source on Medieval Zoroastrian doctrine and legend. The work is also known as the AyƒÅdgƒÅr ƒ´ JƒÅmƒÅspƒ´g or AyƒÅtkƒÅr-ƒ´ JƒÅmƒÅspƒ´k, meaning \\"[In] Memoriam of Jamasp\\". The text takes the form of a series of questions and answers between Vishtasp and Jamasp, both of whom were amongst Zoroaster's immediate and closest disciples. Vishtasp was the princely protector and patron of Zoroaster while Jamasp was a nobleman at Vishtasp's court. Both are figures mentioned in the Gathas, the oldest hymns of Zoroastrianism and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster. Here (chap. 3.6-7) there occurs a striking theological statement, that Ohrmazd‚Äôs creation of the seven Ama≈°aspands was like lamps being lit one from another, none being diminished thereby. The question-answer series is a common literary technique in Zoroastrian literature. In the past, and among Zoroastrians themselves, this technique was frequently misunderstood to be an indication of a first-hand account. The text has survived in three forms: * a Pahlavi manuscript, that is, a rendering of the Middle Persian language using an Aramaic-derived script and accompanied by Aramaic ideograms. The Pahlavi manuscript is damaged and fragmented. * a transmission in Pazand, that is, a rendering of the Middle Persian language using Avestan script (also an Aramaic derivative) but without any non-Iranian vocabulary. The Pazend version has survived in its entirety. * a Modern Persian translation in Arabic script has also survived. It is slightly younger than the other two manuscripts.

It is operated by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust on behalf of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group. There is an accident and emergency unit, together with a maternity unit, high dependency unit and a mental health wing. History Introduction This extensive hospital site originally housed three separate hospitals: Crumpsall Hospital, Delaunays Hospital and Springfield Hospital. The three amalgamated to create North Manchester General Hospital in 1977. Crumpsall Hospital Crumpsall Hospital built as an infirmary in 1876 Patient in bed with nurse, diet and prescription board at Crumpsall Hospital in 1890 Crumpsall Infirmary Committee plaque 1930 Crumpsall Hospital was built as an infirmary for the Manchester Union Workhouse and opened in 1876. In 1914 the hospital was a receiving station firstly for 500 casualties from Belgium. By 1924 there was an X-ray department, ear, eye and dental departments and a chiropody room. There were then 4 or 5 resident medical officers, who usually stayed for about 2 years, rotating through the different specialities. In 1927 a new dispensary and a separate block for operating theatres, X-ray, dental and recovery rooms was built. The Infirmary had 1,440 beds in 1928 with a further 600 in the attached mental department. The patients included both chronic and acute cases and both acute cases and the work of the obstetric and gynaecological department had been increasing. The hospital had a bacteriological and pathological laboratory and was a registered training school for nurses both in general medical and surgical work and in midwifery. in 1929 it became a municipal hospital.The Book of Manchester and Salford written for the ninety-seventh annual meeting of the British Medical Association in July 1929. Manchester: George Falkner & Sons, 1929; p. 138-39 In 1948 the hospital joined the National Health Service. In 1951 a nurses sick bay, a premature babies unit and a new Physiotherapy department were opened. In 1952 the hospital was recognised by Manchester University for clinical teaching and some of the senior medical staff were appointed honorary lecturers. Delaunays Hospital Delaunays Hospital was designed by Thomas Worthington as a workhouse and hospital for the Prestwich Board of Guardians and opened in 1869. The Prestwich Workhouse and Hospital was absorbed into the Manchester Union Workhouse in 1915. Springfield Hospital The Cotton Famine Window, North Manchester General Hospital, taken from a convalescent home in Southport Springfield Hospital had its origins in the new Manchester Union Workhouse, designed by Mills and Murgatroyd, and completed in 1853. The workhouse developed into a hospital for the mentally ill known as the Crumpsall Institution. It was renamed Park House in 1939 and became Springfield Hospital on joining the National Health Service in 1948. Post-merger Crumpsall Hospital, Delaunays Hospital and Springfield Hospital amalgamated to create North Manchester General Hospital in 1977. After the Victoria Memorial Jewish Hospital closed in 1992, the Jewish Victoria Wing was established at the North Manchester General Hospital. Similarly, after the Northern Hospital for Women and Children closed in 1994, women's and children's services were centralised at the North Manchester General Hospital and a new women's and children's block opened in June 2010. Plans to build a new intermediate care centre were announced in 2019.  Management from 2020  Since April 2020, the hospital is managed by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust under a management agreement with Northern Care Alliance NHS Group. The NHS Group was formed in 2017 to combine Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust ‚Äì which previously operated the hospital ‚Äì with Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.

A sports club or sporting club, sometimes athletics club or sports society or sports association, is a group of people formed for the purpose of playing sports. Sports clubs range from organisations whose members play together, unpaid, and may play other similar clubs on occasion, watched mostly by family and friends, to large commercial organisations with professional players which have teams which regularly compete against those of other clubs and attract sometimes very large crowds of paying spectators. Clubs may be dedicated to a single sport or to several (multi-sport club). The term athletics club is sometimes used for a general sports club, rather than one dedicated to athletics proper.  Organization  Larger sports clubs are characterized by having professional and amateur departments in various sports such as bike polo, football, basketball, futsal, cricket, volleyball, handball, rink hockey, bowling, water polo, rugby, track and field athletics, boxing, baseball, cycling, tennis, rowing, gymnastics and others, including less traditional sports such as airsoft, billiards, orienteering, paintball or roller derby. The teams and athletes belonging to a sports club may compete in several different leagues, championships and tournaments wearing the same club colors and using the same club name, sharing also the same club fan base, supporters and facilities. Many professional sports clubs have an associate system where the affiliated supporters pay an annuity fee. In those cases, supporters become eligible to attend the club's home matches and exhibitions across the entire season, and have the right to practice almost every kind of sport at the club's facilities. Registered associate member fees, attendance receipts, sponsoring contracts, team merchandising, TV rights, and athlete/player transfer fees, are usually the primary sources of sports club financing. In addition, there are sports clubs, or its teams, which are publicly traded and listed on a stock exchange - several professional European football clubs belonging to a larger multistports club are examples of this (namely, Portuguese SADs (Sociedade An√≥nima Desportiva) such as Sport Lisboa e Benfica and Sporting Clube de Portugal, or Spanish SADs (Sociedad An√≥nima Deportiva) Real Zaragoza, S.A.D. and Real Betis Balompi√© S.A.D., as well as Italian clubs like Societ√† Sportiva Lazio S.p.A.). Some sports teams are owned and financed by a single non-sports company, for example the several sports teams owned by Red Bull GmbH and collectively known as Red Bulls.Red Bulls redbulls.com Other examples of this are the several sports teams owned by Bayer AG and Philips corporations through the TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen and PSV Eindhoven respectively, that originally were works teams, the teams owned by the Samsung Group, and the teams owned by the Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG). They may compete in several different sports and leagues, being headquartered in some cases across several countries. Membership In the field of competitive club sports, an athlete will typically be registered to only one club for a given discipline and will compete for that club exclusively for the duration of a competition or season. Exceptions to this include player trades and transfers, athlete loan agreements and unattached trialists. Where an athlete competes in multiple disciplines, or where club membership has social or training aspects such as local athletic clubs, then athletes may register with multiple clubs. Multiple membership is more common in the case of individual sports, such as the sport of athletics, where a distance runner may compete for a track and field team as well as a road running team, and also have further membership at a local sports club for training purposes. Some national sports bodies require an athlete to state a priority order of their club membership, outlining which club has the higher, or first, claim on the athlete's services.Managing Athlete Registrations. England Athletics. Retrieved 2019-06-03. Sports clubs around the world In many regions of the world like Europe, North Africa, Middle East, Indian subcontinent or Latin America, sports clubs with several sports departments (multisports clubs) or branches, including highly competitive professional teams, are very popular and have developed into some of the most powerful and representative sports institutions in those places. In general, student sports can be described as composed by multisports clubs, each one representing its educational institution and competing in several sport disciplines. In the United States major institutions like The New York Athletic Club and Los Angeles Athletic Club serve as athletic clubs that participate in multiple sports. Examples also abound of sports clubs that are in effect one sports team. Each team from the NFL (American football), CFL (Canadian football), NBA (basketball), MLB (baseball), NHL (ice hockey) or MLS (association football) North American sports leagues, can be called sports clubs, but in practice, they focus solely on a single sport. There are some exceptions, especially when multiple such teams are under one ownership structure, in which case the club may be referred to as a \\"sports and entertainment\\" company; see, for example, the One Buffalo sports club, which fields an NFL team (the Buffalo Bills), three hockey teams (Buffalo Sabres, Buffalo Beauts, and Rochester Americans), professional lacrosse (Buffalo Bandits), and general athletics and fitness (Impact Sports and Performance). On the other hand, American varsity teams are generally organized into a structure forming a true multi-sport club belonging to an educational institution, but varsity collegiate athletics are almost never referred to as clubs; \\"club sports\\" in American colleges and universities refer to sports that are not directly sponsored by the colleges but by student organizations (see National Club Football Association and American Collegiate Hockey Association for two leagues consisting entirely of college \\"club\\" teams in American football and ice hockey, respectively). In the United Kingdom, almost all major sports organizations are dedicated to a single sport, with a few minor multisport clubs such as Catford Wanderers. In addition, like in several other countries, many universities and colleges develop a wide range of student sport activities including at a professional or semi-professional level. Fulham F.C. once ran a professional rugby league team and rowing club, which other football clubs have emulated since. Many football clubs originate from cricket teams. Today, most major cities have separate clubs for each sport (e.g. Manchester United football club and Lancashire County Cricket Club are based in Manchester). Many clubs internationally describe themselves as football clubs (\\"FC\\", \\"Football Club\\" in British English and \\"Fu√üball-Club\\" in German; \\"CF\\", Clube de Futebol in Portuguese and Club de F√∫tbol in Spanish). Generally, British football clubs field only football teams. Their counterparts in several other countries tend to be full multi-sport clubs, even when called football clubs (Futebol Clube do Porto; Fu√üball-Club Bayern M√ºnchen; Futbol Club Barcelona). The equivalent abbreviation \\"SC\\" (for \\"Soccer Club\\") is occasionally used in North American English (for example, the Chicago Fire S.C.), but a general reluctance to North Americanize the sport means that most North American teams, somewhat ambiguously (and perhaps erroneously, as \\"football\\" in North American English refers to North American gridiron-style football) still use \\"F.C.\\" in their name instead (e.g. FC Dallas or Toronto FC).

In the course of his eventful career, La Chetardie was sent on diplomatic errands throughout Europe: in London (1727), then in Holland and Prussia, in Russia twice, and finally in Turin in 1749 in the company of Jean-Louis Favier. When he arrived as Ambassador to Saint Petersburg in 1739, he found all the key positions in the imperial administration in the hands of ethnic Germans, inimical to his own country. In order to counterbalance their influence, La Chetardie approached his compatriot, Count Lestocq, and the Swedish ambassador, who was preparing the war with Russia. Their complex manoeuvring resulted in the coup d'etat which made Peter the Great's daughter Elizaveta the new Empress. The front page of the 1862 edition of La Chetardie's dispatches. Upon her accession to the throne, she awarded La Chetardie with the Order of Saint Andrew and Order of Saint Anna, and he triumphantly returned to Paris, rather naively expecting (and persuading his peers in Versailles) that Elizaveta would abolish her father's reforms, restore the capital to Moscow, and return Russia to its pre-Petrine state, when the Russian diplomacy had not dared to meddle with French designs. Yet he proved to be mistaken as Elizabeth persevered in establishing Russia as a great power to be reckoned with, entrusting the task to the Austrophilic Chancellor Bestuzhev. In 1743 La Chetardie was again in the Russian capital, clamoring for attention from the Empress and busily intriguing with Elizabeth of Holstein (Catherine II's mother) and Lestocq against Bestuzhev. Their correspondence was intercepted by the latter's agents and divulged to the Empress, who ordered the intriguer to be expelled from the country. The disgruntled Louis XV had him immured in the citadel of Montpellier. Upon his release, La Chetardie took part in the Battle of Rosbach and served as the castellan of Hanau, where he died.

It offers the ability to set up a circuit with a graphical user interface and simulate the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit. Pure digital simulations are also supported using VHDL and/or Verilog. Qucs supports a growing list of analog and digital components as well as SPICE sub-circuits. It is intended to be much simpler to use and handle than other circuit simulators like gEDA or PSPICE.  Analysis types  Analysis types include S-parameter (including noise), AC (including noise), DC, Transient Analysis, Harmonic Balance (not yet finished), Digital simulation (VHDL and Verilog-HDL) and Parameter sweeps.  Features at a glance  QUCS has a graphical interface for schematic capture. Simulation data can be represented in various types of diagrams, including Smith-Chart, Cartesian, Tabular, Polar, Smith- Polar combination, 3D-Cartesian, Locus Curve, Timing Diagram and Truth Table. The documentation offers many useful tutorials (WorkBook), reports (ReportBook) and a technical description of the simulator. Other features include the transmission line calculator, Filter synthesis, Smith-Chart tool for power and noise matching, Attenuator design synthesis, Device model and subcircuit library manager, Optimizer for analog designs, the Verilog-A interface, Support for multiple languages (GUI and internal help system), Subcircuit (including parameters) hierarchy, Powerful data post-processing possible using equations and symbolically defined nonlinear and linear devices.  Tool suite  Qucs consists of several standalone programs interacting with each other through a GUI. The GUI is used to create schematics, setup simulations, display simulation results, writing VHDL code, etc. The analog simulator, gnucsator, is a command line program which is run by the GUI in order to simulate the schematic which you previously setup. It reads a netlist file augmented with commands, performs simulations, and finally produces a dataset file. It can also report errors. The GUI includes a text editor which can display netlists and simulation logging information. It is handy to edit files related to certain components (e.g. SPICE netlists, or Touchstone files). A filter synthesis application can help design various types of filters. The transmission line calculator can be used to design and analyze different types of transmission lines (e.g. microstrips, coaxial cables). A component library manager gives access to models for real life devices (e.g. transistors, diodes, bridges, opamps). These are usually implemented as macros. The library can be extended by the user. The attenuator synthesis application can be used to design various types of passive attenuators. The command line conversion program tool is used by the GUI to import and export datasets, netlists and schematics from and to other CAD/EDA software. The supported file formats as well as usage information can be found on the manpage of qucsconv. Additionally, the GUI can steer other EDA tools. Analog and mixed simulations can be performed by simulators that read the qucsator netlist format. For purely digital simulations (via VHDL) the program FreeHDL or Icarus-Verilog can be used. For circuit optimization (minimization of a cost function), ASCO may be invoked.  Components  The following categories of components are provided: * Lumped components (R, L, C, amplifier, phase shifter, etc.) * Sources * Probes * Transmission lines * Nonlinear components (diodes, transistors, etc.) * Digital components * File containers (S-parameter datasets, SPICE netlists) * Paintings There is also a Component library that includes various standard components available in the market (bridges, diodes, varistors, LEDs, JFETs, MOSFETS, and so on).  Transistor models  QUCS supports transistor models, some need to be added by hand. Some have been tested, these include * FBH-HBT * HICUM L0 v1.12 * HICUM L0 v1.2 * HICUM L2 v2.1 * HICUM L2 v2.22 * HICUM L2 v2.23 * MESFET (Curtice, Statz, TOM-1 and TOM-2) * SGP (SPICE Gummel-Poon) * MOSFET * JFET * EPFL-EKV MOSFET v2.6.

Analytical  Salicylates can be identified by GC/MS, proton NMR, and IR.  In vitro  One of the first in vitro tests for aspirin was through the Trinder reaction. Aqueous ferric chloride was added to a urine sample, and the formation of the iron complex turned the solution purple. This test was not specific to acetylsalicylic acid but would occur in the presence of any phenol or enol. The downfall of this test occurs in the presence of hyperbilirubinemia or elevated bilirubin. When the level of bilirubin exceeds 1 mg/dl, a false positive could occur.  Enzyme Specific Assay  The current in vitro testing utilizes molecule specific methods of detecting salicylates.  Immunoassay  Another identification mechanism is through immunoassay. Abbott Labs' AxSYM is an immunoassay device utilizing Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay (FPIA) technology that can determine the presence and quantify salicylates. The introduction of a salicylate specific antigen labeled with fluorescein into the sample will mark the sample. Upon irradiation with 490nm light, some of that light will be reflected back to a detector at 520nm. Polarization allows the machine to detect the difference between antibody bound, and unbound fluorescein.

Irish lyrics The lyrics are as follows: :There was a wild colonial boy, :Jack Duggan was his name :He was born and raised in Ireland, :in a place called Castlemaine :He was his father's only son, :his mother's pride and joy :And dearly did his parents love :the wild colonial boy :At the early age of sixteen years, :he left his native home :And to Australia's sunny shore, :he was inclined to roam :He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, :he shot James MacEvoy :A terror to Australia was :the wild colonial boy :One morning on the prairie, :as Jack he rode along :A-listening to the mocking bird, :a-singing a cheerful song :Up stepped a band of troopers: :Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy :They all set out to capture him, :the wild colonial boy :Surrender now, Jack Duggan, :for you see we're three to one. :Surrender in the Queen's high name, :you are a plundering son :Jack drew two pistols from his belt, :he proudly waved them high. :\\"I'll fight, but not surrender,\\" :said the wild colonial boy :He fired a shot at Kelly, :which brought him to the ground :And turning round to Davis, :he received a fatal wound :A bullet pierced his proud young heart, :from the pistol of Fitzroy :And that was how they captured him, :the wild colonial boy Australian lyrics The Australian version is quite different. It is about a boy named Jack Dolan, born in Castlemaine. The poem then continues on to tell of his exploits without mentioning his moving to Australia, which implies that the Castlemaine in question is that in Victoria. Here is one version of the \\"Jack Dolan/Doolan/Duggan\\" poem: Chorus: :Come along my hearties, :We'll roam the mountains high, :Together we will plunder, :Together we will ride. :We'll scour through the valleys, :And gallop o'er the plains, :And scorn to live in :slavery, bound down by iron chains. :It's of a wild Colonial Boy, :Jack Dolan was his name, :Of poor but honest parents, :He was born in Castlemaine. :He was his father's only son, :His mother's pride and joy, :And so dearly did his parents love :The wild Colonial Boy. :When scarcely sixteen years of age, :He left his father's home, :And through Australia's sunny shores :A bushranger did roam. :He'd rob the largest squatters, :Their stock he would destroy, :A terror to Australia was :The wild Colonial Boy. :In sixty-one this daring youth :Commenced his wild career, :With a heart that knew no danger, :No stranger did he fear. :He bailed up the Beechworth roll mail-coach, :And robbed Judge MacEvoy, :Who trembled and gave up his gold to :The wild Colonial Boy. :He bade the judge \\"Good morning,\\" :And told him to beware, :That he'd never rob a poor man :Who wafted on the square, :Three mounted troopers came in sight, :Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy, :Who thought that they would capture him, :The wild Colonial Boy. :\\"Surrender now, Jack Dolan, :You see we're three to one. :Surrender in the queen's high name, :You daring highwayman.\\" :Jack drew a pistol from his belt, :And waved it like a toy, :\\"I'll fight, but not surrender,\\" :Cried the wild Colonial Boy. :He fired at Trooper Kelly, :And brought him to the ground, :And in return from Davis, :He received a mortal wound. :All shattered through the jaws he lay, :Still firing at Fitzroy, :And that's the way they captured him ‚Äì :The wild Colonial Boy.

Recordings by Del Shannon and also The Sparks Of Rhythm list Charles Merenstein as a co-writer, as does BMI. The Sparks Of Rhythm version on the Apollo 541 single version released in 1959 credits Andrew Barksdale and Merenstein as writers omitting Jimmy Jones. The song is noted for Jones singing \\"Come-a, come-a come-a come-a, come come-a, yeah\\" lyrics, which are heard at the beginning as well as in the coda of the song, before the song's fade. It was originally recorded by The Sparks Of Rhythm, a group Jones had been a member of when he wrote it, although he was not with them when they recorded it. That version was in a minor key, and had a completely different melody. When Jimmy Jones recorded it, the song was changed to a major key, with a completely different melody. In 1959, Jones recorded the song himself, in a version which had been reworked by Blackwell, who also produced the session. In addition, Blackwell also provided the whistling, which is prominently heard throughout the whole song. \\"Handy Man\\" reached No. 3 on the R&B; charts and No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960 behind Theme from A Summer Place by Percy Faith, becoming a million seller. The song was a hit again in 1964, reaching No. 22 for Del Shannon and yet again in 1977 for James Taylor. Taylor's version peaked at #1 in September 1977 on the RPM Top Singles chart. Measured in terms of popularity on any chart, Taylor's version of the song was the most successful. It reached No. 2 on the Cash Box Top 100 chart and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also hit No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Taylor's version also earned him his second Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. Taylor's version featured Leah Kunkel as backup singer, singing the \\"comma comma\\" sections in harmony, which is heard after the second verse as well as in the coda of the song. AllMusic critic Jason Elias compares Jones' original with Taylor's version stating that \\"where Jones‚Äôs version was chipper and a little obnoxious,\\" Taylor's version \\"is so laid back it‚Äôs almost somnolent.\\" Elias notes that Taylor's slowed down version has the benefit of allowing him to shade the words in new ways. Elias also praises Taylor's guitar playing. Billboard Magazine described Taylor's version as \\"fluidly soft and laid back throughout\\" with spice added by the background harmonies.

Situated on a gravel bank just above sea-level, it is the lowest hill fort in Britain. Around 500 BC, when fortification is thought to have begun at this site, this \\"hill\\" would have provided a significant area of habitable land amidst the flooded marshes of the fens. The site exhibits at least two phases of development over several hundred years of settlement, with a D-shaped set of earth banks surrounded by a larger, more formal set of banks and ditches. Roman control The fort is a possible site of the battle of 47 AD mentioned by Tacitus, between the Iceni tribe and a Roman auxiliary force under governor Ostorius Scapula. Human remains have been found around the site including sword-marked adult bones and the cleaved skull of a child, indicating that the inhabitants were trapped and attacked within the settlement. The remains of a multi-storey Roman tower have also been excavated within sight to the north of the Stonea Camp fortifications.Stonea Camp , Cambridgeshire County Council, accessed 20 September 2013 The building was possibly constructed to suppress further tribal rebellion or settlement at this site. Excavation and restoration Excavation work was carried out in 1980 by the British Museum, and restoration work followed in 1991 to recover the outer bank system and ditches which have been worn away by agriculture. The Cambridgeshire County Council Archaeology department has continued to carry out restoration work at the site. To prevent further damage by agriculture, the area is now designated as a pocket park and scheduled ancient monument.

In grammar‚Äìtranslation classes, students learn grammatical rules and then apply those rules by translating sentences between the target language and the native language. Advanced students may be required to translate whole texts word-for-word. The method has two main goals: to enable students to read and translate literature written in the source language, and to further students' general intellectual development. It originated from the practice of teaching Latin; in the early 16th century, students learned Latin for communication, but after the language died out it was studied purely as an academic discipline. When teachers started teaching other foreign languages in the 19th century, they used the same translation- based approach as had been used for teaching Latin. The method has been criticized for its shortcomings.Zhou, G. & Niu, X. (2015). Approaches to language teaching and learning. Journal of Language Teaching and Research, 6(4), p. 798  Criticism of term  The overall concept of grammar- translation has been criticized since few verifiable sources support the existence of such a method until the 19th century.  History and philosophy  The grammar‚Äìtranslation method originated from the practice of teaching Latin. In the early 16th century, Latin was the most widely studied foreign language because of its prominence in government, academia and business. However, the use of Latin then dwindled and was gradually replaced by English, French and Italian. After the decline of Latin, the purpose of learning it in schools changed. Previously, students had learned Latin for the purpose of communication, but it came to be learned as a purely academic subject . Throughout Europe in the 18th and the 19th centuries, the education system was formed primarily around a concept called faculty psychology. The theory dictated that the body and mind were separate and the mind consisted of three parts: the will, emotion and intellect. It was believed that the intellect could eventually be sharpened enough to control the will and emotions by learning Greek and Roman classical literature and mathematics. Additionally, an adult with such an education was considered mentally prepared for the world and its challenges. At first, it was believed that teaching modern languages was not useful for the development of mental discipline and so they were left out of the curriculum. When modern languages began to appear in school curricula in the 19th century, teachers taught them with the same grammar‚Äìtranslation method as was used for Classical Latin and Ancient Greek. Textbooks were therefore essentially copied for the modern language classroom. In the United States, the basic foundations of the method were used in most high school and college foreign language classrooms.  Principles and goals  There are two main goals to grammar‚Äìtranslation classes. One is to develop students' reading ability to a level where they can read literature in the target language. The other is to develop students' general mental discipline. Users of foreign language want to note things of their interest in the literature of foreign languages. Therefore, this method focuses on reading and writing and has developed techniques which facilitate more or less the learning of reading and writing only. As a result, speaking and listening are overlooked.Kho, Mu-Jeong (2016). How to Implant a Semiotic and Mathematical DNA into Learning English, Seoul: Booklab Publishing Co. (53740), 261 pages.  Method  Grammar‚Äìtranslation classes are usually conducted in the students' native language. Grammatical rules are learned deductively; students learn grammar rules by rote, and then practice the rules by doing grammar drills and translating sentences to and from the target language. More attention is paid to the form of the sentences being translated than to their content. When students reach more advanced levels of achievement, they may translate entire texts from the target language. Tests often involve translating classical texts. There is usually no listening or speaking practice, and very little attention is placed on pronunciation or any communicative aspects of the language. The skill exercised is reading and then only in the context of translation.  Materials  The mainstay of classroom materials for the grammar‚Äìtranslation method is textbooks, which, in the 19th century, attempted to codify the grammar of the target language into discrete rules that students were to learn and memorize. A chapter in typical grammar‚Äìtranslation textbooks would begin with a bilingual vocabulary list and then grammatical rules for students to study and sentences for them to translate. Some typical sentences from 19th-century textbooks are as follows: > The philosopher pulled the lower jaw of the hen. > My sons have bought the mirrors of the Duke. > The cat of my aunt is more treacherous than the dog of your uncle., cited > in .  Reception  The method by definition has a very limited scope. Because speaking and any kind of spontaneous creative output were excluded from the curriculum, students would often fail at speaking or even letter-writing in the target language. A noteworthy quote describing the effect of the method comes from Bahlsen, a student of Pl√∂tz, a major proponent of this method in the 19th century. In commenting about writing letters or speaking he said he would be overcome with \\"a veritable forest of paragraphs, and an impenetrable thicket of grammatical rules\\". According to Richards and Rodgers, the grammar‚Äìtranslation has been rejected as a legitimate language teaching method by modern scholars: > [T]hough it may be true to say that the Grammar-Translation Method is still > widely practiced, it has no advocates. It is a method for which there is no > theory. There is no literature that offers a rationale or justification for > it or that attempts to relate it to issues in linguistics, psychology, or > educational theory.  Influence  The grammar‚Äìtranslation method was the standard way languages were taught in schools from the 17th to the 19th centuries. Despite attempts at reform from Roger Ascham, Montaigne, Comenius and John Locke, no other methods then gained any significant popularity. Later, theorists such as Vi√´tor, Passy, Berlitz, and Jespersen began to talk about what a new kind of foreign language instruction needed, shedding light on what the grammar‚Äìtranslation was missing. They supported teaching the language, not about the language, and teaching in the target language, emphasizing speech as well as text. Through grammar‚Äìtranslation, students lacked an active role in the classroom, often correcting their own work and strictly following the textbook. Despite all of these drawbacks, the grammar‚Äìtranslation method is still the most used method all over the world in language teaching . That is unsurprising since most language proficiency books and tests are in the format of grammar‚Äìtranslation method.  References Sources *Bonilla Carvajal, C. A.

Opened in 1930, it contains 1,083 rooms and is classified as a mid-priced hotel. The building offers two restaurants and approximately of conference space. The New Yorker Hotel was successful in its early years, hosting many famous personalities. In the 1950s, the hotel was sold multiple times, including to Hilton Hotels. By the time Hilton reacquired the New Yorker Hotel in 1967, it had become unprofitable and Hilton closed it in 1972. The Unification Church purchased the building in 1975, and two decades later, elected to convert a portion of the building to use as a hotel again. Since re-opening as a hotel in 1994, the New Yorker Hotel has undergone approximately $100 million in capital improvements, including lobby and room renovations and infrastructure modernization. It has been part of the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts chain since 2014. History Construction and early years The New Yorker Hotel was built by Garment Center developer Mack Kanner. When the project was announced in 1928, the Sugarman and Berger designed building was planned to be 38 stories, at an estimated cost of $8 million. However, when it was completed in 1929, the building had grown to 43 stories, at a final cost of $22.5 million and contained 2,500 rooms, making it the city's largest for many years.https://www.newyorkerhotel.com/history/ Hotel management pioneer Ralph Hitz was selected as its first manager, eventually becoming president of the National Hotel Management Company. An early ad for the building boasted that the hotel's \\"bell boys were 'as snappy- looking as West Pointers'\\" and \\"that it had a radio in every room with a choice of four stations\\".'One Thousand New York Buildings, by Jorg Brockman and Bill Harris, page 257, Published by Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, Inc., 2002 It was a New Yorker bellboy, Johnny Roventini, who served as tobacco company Philip Morris' pitchman for twenty years, making famous their \\"Call for Philip Morris\\" advertising campaign. The hotel opened on January 2, 1930. Much like its contemporaries, the Empire State Building (1931) and the Chrysler Building (1930), the New Yorker was designed in the Art Deco style which was popular in the 1920s and 1930s. In his book New York 1930 Robert A. M. Stern said the \\"New Yorker's virtually unornamented facades consisted of alternating vertical bands of warm gray brick and windows, yielding an impression of boldly modeled masses. This was furthered by the deep-cut light courts, which produced a powerful play of light and shade that was enhanced by dramatic lighting at night\\".New York 1930, Architectural and Urbanism Between the Two World Wars, by Robert A.M. Stern, Gregory Gilmartin, Thomas Mellins, page 204, Published by Rizzoli International Publications, Inc., 1987 In addition to the ballrooms there were ten private dining \\"salons\\" and five restaurants employing 35 master cooks. There were twenty six murals painted in the hotel by Lajos \\"Louis\\" Jambor. The barber shop was one of the largest in the world with 42 chairs and 20 manicurists. There were 95 switchboard operators and 150 laundry staff washing as many as 350,000 pieces daily.Plaque honoring Nikola Tesla, who lived in the hotel for ten years until he diedIn his final years, the inventor Nikola Tesla lived in the hotel's room 3327 and died there penniless on January 7, 1943.Phil Mennitti, The Illusion of Democracy: A More Accurate History of the Modern United States (2015), p. 53 Mid- and late 20th century Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the hotel was among New York's most fashionable. The New York Observer noted that in the building's heyday, \\"actors, celebrities, athletes, politicians, mobsters, the shady and the luminous‚Äîthe entire Brooklyn Dodgers roster during the glory seasons‚Äîwould stalk the bars and ballrooms, or romp upstairs\\"; In May 1949, the hotel hosted the first concurrent annual meetings of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association and the International Ice Hockey Federation. It hosted many popular Big Bands, such as Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, while notable figures such as Spencer Tracy, Joan Crawford and Fidel Castro stayed there. Inventor Nikola Tesla spent the last ten years of his life in near-seclusion in Suite 3327, where he died, largely devoting his time to feeding pigeons while occasionally meeting dignitaries.Cooing for a strange genius Bloomberg News, 2008-05-11 In later years, Muhammad Ali would recuperate there after his March 1971 fight against Joe Frazier at the Garden. Notwithstanding its early success, New York's changing economy and demographics caused the building to slowly decline and, as a result, its ownership changed several times. It was purchased by Hilton Hotels in 1953 for $12.5 million and following an antitrust suit by the federal government, was sold just three years later, in 1956, for $20 million to Massaglia Hotels. In 1959, Massaglia sold the hotel to an investment syndicate known as New York Towers Ltd., which went bankrupt, allowing Hilton to reacquire the building in 1967. By the time Hilton reacquired the hotel, the pronounced decline in New York's fortunes, coupled with the construction of new, more modern hotels, caused the New Yorker to become unprofitable. As a result, Hilton closed the hotel in April 1972. Though the building was initially left vacant, several proposals were made, including redevelopment as a low-income housing development, and a hospital. Ultimately, in 1975, it was purchased by the Unification Church of the United States for $5.6 million. The church converted much of the building for use by its members.Biermans, J. 1986, The Odyssey of New Religious Movements, Persecution, Struggle, Legitimation: A Case Study of the Unification Church Lewiston, New York and Queenston, Ontario: The Edwin Melton Press Reopening Close-up of the towerIn 1994, the Unification Church elected to convert a portion of the building to use as a hotel again and the New Yorker Hotel Management Company took over operation of the building. It began the largest renovation project in the New Yorker's nearly 65-year history, completed in 1999, with $20 million in capital improvements. The hotel joined the Ramada chain in 2000. In 2005, the hotel's management began the process of replacing the New Yorker's famous sign, which hadn't been lit since 1967 and was badly in need of repair. The sign was completely replaced by an energy efficient LED sign that was installed in time to celebrate the hotel's 75th Anniversary. A 75th Anniversary celebratory event was held at the hotel on December 8, 2005, where the new sign was officially switched on for the first time by Dr. Charles Yang, President of the New Yorker Hotel Management Company, Kevin H. Smith, the hotel's General Manager, Alan Ostroff, of the Cornell University School of Hotel Management, Jeanne Cummins, vocalist of the Bernie Cummins Orchestra, the hotel's house band in the 1930s and Patricia Hitz-Bradshaw, granddaughter of Ralph Hitz, the hotel's first General Manager.New Yorker Hotel Press ReleaseRoberta on the Arts: New Yorker Hotel's 75th Anniversary Gala and Historic Re-Lighting of its Two-Story Sign In August 2007, the hotel began a second capital improvement program, which was completed in February 2009 at a final cost of $70 million. These improvements increased the number of guest rooms available from 178 in 1994 to 912, located on floors 19 through 40.\\"New Yorker Hotel embarks on $65 million renovation\\". Press release. The renovation project was designed by Stonehill & Taylor Architects. Interior improvements included room restructuring and augmentation (now called \\"Metro\\" and \\"City View\\" rooms). Other improvements included a refurbished front entrance, lobby redesign, foyer reconstruction, and ballroom renovations. The hotel also expanded its Wi-Fi and PDA support, and added high-definition flat-screen televisions in all rooms. In addition, individual room air-conditioning units were replaced with modern centralized heating and cooling systems throughout the entire hotel. In 2009, conference room space was added to the hotel through the conversion of a defunct Manufacturer's Hanover Bank branch in the hotel, bringing the total meeting space to just over , in two ballrooms and twelve conference rooms.alt= The New Yorker Hotel joined the Wyndham Hotels chain in March 2014. Wyndham has undertaken additional upgrades to the hotel, including lobby and restaurant renovations, to attract more business travelers in anticipation of the massive Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project to the west. Power plant When it was built, the New Yorker Hotel had coal-fired steam boilers and generators sufficient to produce more than 2,200 kilowatts of direct current electric power. At the time, this was the largest private power plant in the United States. The hotel's own direct current generators were still in use during the Northeast Blackout of 1965, but by the late 1960s the hotel's power system had been modernized to alternating current.Tom Blalock, Powering the New Yorker: A Hotel's Unique Direct Current System, in IEEE Power and Energy Magazine, Jan/Feb 2006 In a dedication ceremony held on September 25, 2008, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) named the New Yorker Hotel's direct current power plant a Milestone in Electrical Engineering. A bronze plaque commemorating the achievement was presented to the hotel by IEEE.

Johnson (May 22, 1962 ‚Äì August 31, 1996) was a professional drag racer. Blaine, along with his lifelong crew chief and brother, Alan, were competitors in the NHRA Top Alcohol Dragster Series, a series which they entered in 1988. Johnson won four championships in that series (1990‚Äì1993). He entered the Top Fuel class in 1994 after receiving his competition license for that class prior to the beginning of the season that year. At the time of his death, Johnson held a record 26 NHRA titles in the Alcohol Division, until he was later surpassed by Rick Santos. However, on August 31, 1996 Johnson died from injuries sustained in a crash at the NHRA U.S. Nationals held at the Indianapolis Raceway Park. Johnson's engine exploded right as he reached the finish line. Debris from the engine cut down the rear tires; the thick rubber from the tires in turn sheared off the rear wing, causing a loss in aerodynamic downforce at the rear of the dragster, which caused Blaine to lose control. His out-of-control race car then slammed into a guardrail apex (an opening in the guardrail that existed for safety vehicles to enter the track), at around 300 m.p.h.. Johnson's car was heavily damaged as a result of the incident. He was sent to Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital, but was pronounced dead on arrival. Johnson was the first Top Fuel driver to die on track since Pete Robinson at the 1971 Winternationals, and would remain as such until 2004, when Top Fuel driver Darrell Russell was killed during an event in Madison, Illinois. Johnson's final pass was a track-record run of 4.61 seconds, which remained for two years before Gary Scelzi (who succeeded Blaine Johnson as the driver of Alan Johnson's dragster) would beat it. Johnson was also the Top Fuel national record holder at the time of his death (with a 4.59 second elapsed-time), a record that would stand until 1999 when Larry Dixon would beat it. Blaine had amassed enough points in the first part of the year to finish fifth in the season ending points standings. At the awards ceremony after the end of the season, Top Fuel Champion Kenny Bernstein gave his championship trophy to Blaine's brother Alan. According to Alan, that particular trophy is in \\"a place of honor\\" at his home in Santa Maria. The day after his death, on the first day of Eliminations, his opponent Tony Schumacher, performed drag racing's version of a \\"missing man\\" formation, idling down the track out of respect to Johnson. During the final round, event winner Cory McClenethan, who was in the lane opposite Johnson during his last ride down the track, stated very clearly, \\"And I'll tell you something else, when I get up there and get that trophy, it's going to Alan Johnson. Blaine, we love you, buddy.\\" Throughout the rest of the 1996 and deep into the 1997 seasons, the drivers in Top Fuel, and even some in Funny Car, sported stickers on their cars that read \\"In Memory of Blaine Johnson\\". Many drivers continued to have black tape across their car numbers in mourning, and 1996 Top Fuel points Champion Kenny Bernstein dedicated the remainder of the season to the memory of Blaine. After Alan Johnson picked Gary Scelzi to replace Blaine, he designed the new Winston No Bull dragster, which carried on the windscreen \\"In Memory of Blaine Johnson\\" for the remainder of the car's life. Blaine's brother, and crew chief, Alan Johnson, went on to be the crew chief for all three of Gary Scelzi's championships in Top Fuel, and was the crew chief for eight time Top Fuel Champion Tony Schumacher for five of his eight championships, amassing 8 championships as a crew chief. He was part-owner of two car Al-Anabi Racing Top Fuel team. He presided over and tuned the team to three championships. The first title being in 2010 with driver Larry Dixon, then in 2011 with driver Del Worsham, and again in 2013 with driver Shawn Langdon. Alan is currently a co-crew chief with John Force Racing, tuning Top Fuel driver Brittany Force to her first ever Championship in 2017. Thus bringing his total to 12 championships. On the National Hot Rod Association Top 50 Drivers, 1951‚Äì2000, Blaine Johnson was ranked No. 36. In 1996, the NHRA established the Blaine Johnson Memorial Award, which is awarded annually to the person or group that best exemplifies the qualities of Blaine. The award is a small bronze bust of Blaine atop a wooden base, with a brass plaque etched with the winner's name and the words NHRA Blaine Johnson Memorial Trophy. Since 1997, following the NHRA Finals in Pomona, the Johnson Family has hosted the Blaine Johnson Memorial Golf Tournament in which the race community and the public participate to earn funds for the Blaine Johnson Memorial Foundation. The Foundation was created by Blaine's family to provide funds for scholarships to students in the Automotive Technology Lab at Allan Hancock College that exemplify the drive and determination that Blaine exhibited on the track and in life.

History \\"Nisbet in his Heraldry (Edinburgh 1722) says 'The Dicksons are descendants from Richard Keith, said to be a son of the family of Keith, Earls Marischals of Scotland' and in proof thereof carry the chief of Keith Marischal. This Richard was commonly called Dick and the 'son' was styled after him. The affix of son in the Lowlands answering the prefix Mac in the Highlands.\\" As a result, Clan Dickson is considered a sept of Clan Keith. Richard Keith's son, Thomas, took the surname \\"Dickson\\" (in the earliest record spelled Dicson), meaning \\"Dick's son\\" or \\"Richard's son\\". Although long recognised as a Sept of Clan Keith through Thomas Dickson's paternal line, in July 2012 the Clan Douglas Society of North America also recognised the Dickson/Dixon name as a Sept and Allied Family to Clan Douglas.. This recognition resulted from the direct connection through Thomas Dickson's mother, Margaret, daughter of William, the 3rd Lord Douglas and also Thomas' faithfulness to the Douglas Clan, notably to his second cousin William, 7th Lord Douglas and William's son the good Sir James, 8th Lord Douglas. Thomas Dickson (1247‚Äì1307) himself has quite a history. He was associated in some way with William Wallace, and was killed by the English in 1307 in battle. Tradition states he was slashed across the abdomen but continued fight holding the abdominal wound closed with one hand until he finally dropped dead. He is buried in the churchyard of St Brides, Douglas, and his marker shows him with a sword in one hand holding his belly with the other. Robert the Bruce made him Castellan of Castle Douglas the year before he was killed. The Dicksons/Dixons (and 30 other derivates) family name was first found in Scotland whilst the Dixons in England who are of Scottish descent from Thomas Dickson living in 1268 are of the same origin as the Scottish Dicksons. Early records show Thomas Dicson, a follower of the Douglas clan, at the re-capture of Douglas Castle in 1307. The Dickson's coat of arms show the Keith \\"pallets gules\\" and the Douglas \\"mullets argent\\", this is to show their descent from these two ancient Scottish noble families. The family mottoes include \\"Fortes fortuna juvat\\", \\"Coelum versus\\", for Dickson: translated as \\"Fortune favours the brave\\", Heavenward\\"; whilst \\"Quod dixi dixi\\" Dixon, is translated as \\"What I have said I have said\\".

Crockern Tor is a tor in Dartmoor National Park, Devon, England. Composed of two large outcrops of rock, it is 396 metres above sea level. The lower outcrop was the open-air meeting place of the Stannary Convocation of Devon from the early 14th century until the first half of the 18th century. On Parliament Rock, pictured here, the Lord Warden of the Great Court of the Devon Tinners supposedly sat during meetings of the Court. Descriptions The tor was one of only three features on Dartmoor that Tristram Risdon considered important enough to include in his Survey of Devon which was compiled in the early 17th century. In it he said that \\"Crockern Torr\\" had \\"a table and seats of moorstone [granite], hewn out of the rocks, lying in the force of all weather, no house or refuge being near it\\". The tor was also one of the few historic features to appear on Benjamin Donn's one inch to the mile map of Devon of 1765. It lies adjacent to the trans-Dartmoor packhorse track, so was a significant landmark for travellers since time immemorial. Stannary court The tor was the hub of the four Dartmoor stannary areas ‚Äì Ashburton, Chagford, Tavistock and Plympton ‚Äì whose boundaries radiate outwards from it. The Stannary Court was convoked here when deemed necessary, at irregular intervals, by the Lord Warden who summoned 24 representatives or \\"jurates\\" from each of the four stannaries. Each meeting probably continued for several days and dealt with matters such as setting stannary law, registering tinworks and mills, hearing petitions and imposing penalties on those guilty of breaking the stannary laws. There is evidence for ten assemblies at Crockern Tor: in 1494, 1510, 1532, 1533, 1552, 1567, 1574, 1600, 1688 and 1703. The earliest documented meeting on 1 September 1494 had Sir John Stepcote, vice- warden of the Devon Stannaries, as chairman. Sir Walter Raleigh was Lord Warden of the Stannaries for many years, and it is recorded that he presided at one Court at Crockern Tor, on 27 October 1600. The last meeting for which records survive was on 23 September 1703 where the Warden, John Granville, 1st Baron Granville and the Vice-Warden, the Honourable Samuel Rolle,Possibly Robert Rolle, see Devon (UK Parliament constituency). opened the court at 8 a.m. The last court was said to have been held in or around 1745, but no documentation exists, and considering that the tin industry on Dartmoor had by then declined greatly, it could have been only a small affair. Patchy and conflicting evidence indicates that compared to the bare nature of the site today, there were chairs, seats, a table and a shelter, all made of granite, which were used when the court met. These items were supposedly taken away or broken up in the late 18th century, possibly used as a source of stone for the buildings that started to appear on the moor after the roads were improved. On the other hand, Douglas St Leger-Gordon, the noted writer on Devon history, casts doubt on the existence of any substantial meetings at this \\"singularly unsuitable\\" place in his 1963 book, Portrait of Devon. He points out that any proceedings must have been frequently disrupted by the wind carrying away someone's hat, or \\"scattering the minutes of the last meeting insecurely held in the warden's numbed fingers\\". He notes that later records of the Parliament mention adjournments to Tavistock and suggests that a nearby \\"Tinners' Hall\\" - now lost - may have been where they actually conducted their business. Folklore Crockern Tor is said to be the home of the mythical Old Crockern, variously described as a spectral figure on horseback, galloping across the moor on a skeleton horse with his phantom hounds which were stabled at nearby Wistman's Wood; or as a local god of the moor in pre-Christian times: Panorama References Further reading  Category:Tors of Dartmoor Category:History of Devon Category:Tin mining Category:Devon folklore Category:Dartmoor ","title":"Crockern Tor"},{"id":"4532528","text":"Perry Greeley Holden Perry Greeley Holden (October 13, 1865 - October 8, 1959) was the first professor of agronomy in the United States.

In 1960, Michelman was graduated from Harvard Law School. He clerked for Justice William Brennan of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1961 Term. In 1962, he joined the Harvard Law School faculty. Michelman wrote the influential law review article, Property, Utility and Fairness, (80 Harv. L. Rev. 1165 (1967)) on the economic reasons for just compensation in the 5th Amendment Takings Clause in the United States Constitution. This article was cited by the majority in its opinion in Penn Central v. New York City, the Supreme Court case that dealt with the authority of a local New York City landmark law that forbade the railroad company from putting up a skyscraper above the historic Grand Central Terminal structure. Michelman's analysis relied on evaluating whether the nuisance costs and value to society were worth it. He observed that while the Courts did not always provide rulings which were fair or provided utility, they provided as perfect a results that can be obtained by the Courts. He observed that administrative agencies and legislatures were shirking their roles in the compensation process. Michelman served as Vice- President of the American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy 1994-96 and as its President, 1998-2001. Michelman was the first recipient of the College of William and Mary's Brigham-Kanner Property Rights Prize in 2004.

He co-founded Vice in 1994, and permanently relocated to the United States in 2001. In more recent years, he has drawn attention for his far-right political activism and his role as the founder of the Proud Boys, a neo- fascist political group. McInnes claims that he only has supported political violence in self-defense, and that he is not far-right or a supporter of fascism. Born to Scottish parents in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England, McInnes immigrated to Canada as a child. He graduated from Carleton University in Ottawa before moving to Montreal and co-founding Vice with Suroosh Alvi and Shane Smith. He relocated with Vice Media to New York City in 2001. Host of Get Off My Lawn, formerly on Conservative Review Television, he is a contributor to Taki's Magazine and was a frequent guest on television programs on Fox News and TheBlaze and contributor to The Rebel Media. During his time at Vice, McInnes was called a leading figure in the New York hipster subculture. After leaving Vice in 2008, McInnes became increasingly known for his far-right political views. He is the founder of the Proud Boys, a neo- fascist,Weill, Kelly (29 January 2019) \\"How the Proud Boys Became Roger Stone‚Äôs Personal Army\\" The Daily Beast. men's rights and male-only organisation classified as a \\"general hate\\" organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. He has rejected this classification, claiming that the group is \\"not an extremist group and [does] not have ties with white nationalists\\". He holds both Canadian and British citizenship and currently lives in Larchmont, New York. In 2018, McInnes was fired from Blaze Media, and was banned from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for violating terms of use related to promoting violent extremist groups and hate speech. In June 2020, McInnes's account was suspended from YouTube for violating YouTube's policies concerning hate speech, posting content that was \\"glorifying [and] inciting violence against another person or group of people.\\"Rozsa, Matthew (24 July 2020) \\"YouTube suspends account of Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes\\" Salon Early life McInnes was born on 17 July 1970 in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the son of Scottish parents James McInnes, who later became the Vice-President of Operations at Gallium Visual Systems Inc. - a Canadian defence company - and Loraine McInnes, a retired business teacher. His family migrated to Canada when McInnes was four, settling in Ottawa, Ontario. He attended Ottawa's Earl of March Secondary School. As a teen, McInnes played in an Ottawa punk band called Anal Chinook. He graduated from Carleton University. Career Vice Media McInnes co-founded Vice in 1994 with Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi. The magazine was launched as the Voice of Montreal with government funding. The intention of the founders was to provide work and a community service.[Wilkinson, Carl (30 March 2008). \\"The Vice Squad\\". The Guardian. London. Retrieved 30 January 2009.] When the editors later sought to dissolve their commitments with the original publisher Alix Laurent, they bought him out and changed the name to Vice in 1996. Richard Szalwinski, a Canadian software millionaire, acquired the magazine and relocated the operation to New York City in the late 1990s. During McInnis's tenure he was described as the \\"godfather\\" of hipsterdom by WNBC and as \\"one of hipsterdom's primary architects\\" by AdBusters. He occasionally contributed articles to Vice, including \\"The VICE Guide to Happiness\\" and \\"The VICE Guide to Picking Up Chicks\\", and co-authored two Vice books: The Vice Guide to Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll, and Vice Dos and Don'ts: 10 Years of VICE Magazine's Street Fashion Critiques. In an interview in the New York Press in 2002, McInnes said that he was pleased that most Williamsburg hipsters were white. McInnes later wrote in a letter to Gawker that the interview was done as a prank intended to ridicule \\"baby boomer media like The Times\\". After he became the focus of a letter-writing campaign by a black reader, Vice apologized for McInnes's comments. McInnes was featured in a 2003 New York Times article about Vice magazine expressing his political views. In 2006, he was featured in The Vice Guide to Travel with actor and comedian David Cross in China. He left Vice in 2008 due to what he described as \\"creative differences\\". In a 2013 interview with The New Yorker, McInnes said his split with Vice was about the increasing influence of corporate advertising on Vice's content, stating that \\"Marketing and editorial being enemies had been the business plan\\". After Vice In 2008, McInnes created the website StreetCarnage.com. He also co-founded an advertising agency called Rooster where he served as creative director. In 2009, McInnes convinced a journalist at The Village Voice that he had been knocked out after losing a challenge to an MMA fighter.Baron, Zach. \\"Gavin McInnes Gets Knocked the Fuck Out,\\" The Village Voice (5 May 2009). The footage was actually an outtake from a failed TV pilot.\\"The Immersionist with Gavin McInnes,\\" Relevant Pictures. Retrieved 5 April 2011. In 2010, McInnes convinced a journalist at Gawker that he had eaten a bowl of urine-soaked corn flakes after not winning their \\"Hipster of the Decade\\" competition.Kamer, Foster. \\"Hipster of the Decade Loser Gavin McInnes Accepts 'Award' by Eating Bowl of Pissed-In Cereal,\\" Gawker (2 January 2010). The footage was an outtake from a collection of comedy sketches called Gavin McInnes Is a Fucking Asshole. McInnes was featured in Season 3 of the Canadian reality TV show Kenny vs. Spenny, as a judge in the \\"Who is Cooler?\\" episode. In 2010, McInnes was approached by Adult Swim and asked to play the part of Mick, an anthropomorphic Scottish soccer ball, in the short-lived Aqua Teen Hunger Force spin-off Soul Quest Overdrive. After losing a 2010 pilot contest to Cheyenne Cinnamon and the Fantabulous Unicorn of Sugar Town Candy Fudge, six episodes of Soul Quest Overdrive were ordered, with four airing in Adult Swim's 4 AM DVR Theater block on 25 May 2011 before quickly being cancelled. McInnes jokingly blamed the show's cancellation on the other cast members (Kristen Schaal, David Cross, and H. Jon Benjamin) not being \\"as funny\\" as him. In 2012, McInnes wrote a book called How to Piss in Public. In 2013 he directed The Brotherhood of the Traveling Rants, a documentary on his tour as an occasional standup comedian. For the film, he faked a serious car accident. Also that year, McInnes starred in the independent film How to Be a Man, which premiered at Sundance Next Weekend. He has also played supporting roles in other films including Soul Quest Overdrive (2010), Creative Control (2015) and One More Time (2015). In August 2014, McInnes was asked to take an indefinite leave of absence as chief creative officer of Rooster, following online publication at Thought Catalog of an essay about transphobia titled \\"Transphobia is Perfectly Natural\\" Click \\"Continue\\" link at the very bottom of the warning page to view original article. that sparked a call to boycott the company. In response, Rooster issued a statement, saying in part: \\"We are extremely disappointed with his actions and have asked that he take a leave of absence while we determine the most appropriate course of action.\\" In June 2015, broadcaster Anthony Cumia announced that McInnes would be hosting a show on his network, therefore retiring the Free Speech podcast that he had started in March. The Gavin McInnes Show premiered on Compound Media on 15 June. McInnes is a former contributor to Canadian far-right portal The Rebel Media and a regular on conspiracy theorist media platform Infowars' The Alex Jones Show, and Fox News' Red Eye, The Greg Gutfeld Show, and The Sean Hannity Show. He writes for Taki's Magazine and previously wrote for TruthRevolt, Death and Taxes, The Federalist, American Renaissance, and VDARE. In 2016, McInnes referred to Jada Pinkett Smith as a \\"monkey actress\\" on his radio show. On 2 February 2017, in an episode of his YouTube show The Rebel, McInnes announced his resignation from Fox News. McInnes left Rebel Media in August 2017, declaring that he was going to be \\"a multi-media Howard Stern‚Äìmeets‚ÄìTucker Carlson\\". He later joined CRTV, an online television network launched by Conservative Review. The debut episode of his new show Get Off My Lawn aired on 22 September 2017. Events in 2018 On 10 August 2018, McInnes's Twitter account, as well as the account for the Proud Boys, was permanently suspended by Twitter due to their rules against violent extremist groups. The suspension was ahead of the first anniversary of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the small Unite the Right 2 Washington protest in August 2018 in which the Proud Boys participated. On 12 October 2018, McInnes participated in a reenactment of the 1960 assassination of socialist politician Inejiro Asanuma by Otoya Yamaguchi at the Metropolitan Republican Club. After the event, a contingent of Proud Boys were caught on tape beating a protester outside the venue, after members of Antifa threw a plastic bottle at them. On 21 November 2018, shortly after news broke that the FBI had reportedly classified the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to white nationalists, McInnes said that his lawyers had advised him that quitting might help the nine members being prosecuted for the incidents in October and he said \\"this is 100% a legal gesture, and it is 100% about alleviating sentencing\\", and said it was a \\"'stepping down gesture', in quotation marks\\". Two weeks later the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Oregon office said that it had not been their intent to label the entire group as \\"extremist\\",Bernstein, Maxine (4 December 2018) \\"Head of Oregon's FBI: Bureau doesn't designate Proud Boys as extremist group\\" The Oregonian only to characterize the possible threat from certain members of the group that way. Later that month, McInnes was planning on travelling to Australia for a speaking tour with Milo Yiannopoulos and Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley- Lennon's pseudonym), but was informed by Australian immigration authorities that \\"he was judged to be of bad character\\" and would be denied a visa to enter the country. Issuing a visa to McInnes was opposed by an online campaign called \\"#BanGavin\\", which collected 81,000 signatures.Wilson, Jason (30 November 2018) \\"Gavin McInnes: founder of far-right Proud Boys denied Australian visa ‚Äì report\\" The Guardian On 3 December 2018, Conservative Review Television (CRTV), on which McInnes had hosted the Get Off My Lawn program, merged with BlazeTV, the television arm of Glenn Beck's TheBlaze, to become Blaze Media. McInnes was expected to host his program for the new company, whose co-president called McInnes \\"a comedian and provocateur, one of the many varied voices and viewpoints on Blaze Media platforms.\\" Less than a week later, on 8 December, it was announced that McInnes was no longer associated with Blaze Media, with no details given as to why.Bowden, John (8 December 2018) \\"BlazeTV breaks off relationship with founder of the Proud Boys\\" The HillStelloh, Tim (9 December 2018) \\"'Proud Boys' founder Gavin McInnes out at Blaze Media\\" NBC News Two days later, on 10 December, McInnes, who had previously been banned by Amazon, PayPal, Twitter, and Facebook, was banned from YouTube for \\"multiple third-party claims of copyright infringement.\\"Anapol Avery (10 December 2018) \\"YouTube bans Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes\\" The Hill Asked to comment about his firing and bannings, McInnes said that he had been victimized by \\"lies and propaganda\\", and that \\"there has been a concerted effort to de-platform me.\\" In his e-mail to Huffington Post, McInnes stated that \\"Someone very powerful decided long ago that I shouldn't have a voice ... I'm finally out of platforms and unable to defend myself. ... We are no longer living in a free country.\\"Miller, Hayley (10 December 2018) \\"Proud Boys Founder Gavin McInnes Fired From Blaze Media, YouTube Account Disabled\\" HuffPost McInnes also indicated some personal responsibility for the situation in an interview on the ABC News program Nightline, saying. \\"I'm not guilt free in this. There‚Äôs culpability there. I shouldn't have said, you know, violence solves everything or something like that without making the context clear and I regret saying things like that.\\" McInnes stopped short of apologizing or actually retracting his past statements, saying, \\"That ship has sailed.\\"Levin, Jon (12 December 2018) \\"Gavin McInnes Says He 'Regrets' Past Remarks After Social Media Bans: 'I‚Äôm Not Guilt Free'\\" TheWrap Larchmont lawn sign controversy In reaction to the Proud Boys-instigated fight in October 2018, residents of the suburban Westchester community of Larchmont, where McInnes lives, began a \\"Hate Has No Home Here\\" campaign, which involved displaying that slogan on lawn signs around the community. One resident said \\"We stand together as a community, and violence and hate are not tolerated here.\\" Several days after the signs began appearing, McInnes' wife sent emails to their neighbours saying that the media had misrepresented McInnes. Amy Siskind, an activist and writer who lives in nearby Mamaroneck, posted on Facebook that she was planning an anti-hate vigil. After a local newspaper ran a story about it, McInnes and his family appeared at the Siskind's door without invitation or forewarning; she called the police. At the end of December, with the lawn sign campaign still ongoing, McInnes wrote a letter which was dropped off at the homes of his neighbours. In it, he asked them to take down their signs, and described himself as \\"a pro-gay, pro-Israel, virulently anti-racist libertarian,\\" saying that there was nothing \\"hateful, racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic or intolerant\\" in \\"any of my expressions of my worldview,\\" contrary to his past remarks, such as saying he was \\"becoming anti-Semitic\\" after a trip to Israel, or referring to transgender people as \\"gender niggers\\". McInnes said that the Proud Boys was a \\"drinking club [he] started several years ago as a joke\\". Despite the letter's formality, in a podcast on 4 January 2019, McInnes called the neighbours \\"assholes\\", described their behaviour as \\"cunty\\" and said \\"If you have that sign on your lawn, you‚Äôre a fucking retard.\\" One Larchmont resident said about him: \\"I don't care what Gavin says, I've done my research ... He incites violence. He spouts divisive, racist language. And while he may try to say he disowns his followers, he's a part of the problem. So when I read his letter, I was like, yeah, right, this is ridiculous.\\"Campbell, Andy (15 January 2019) \\"Gavin McInnes Is Losing The Battle To Win Over His Neighbors\\" HuffPost Several days after the letter was sent out, HuffPost reported that they had viewed evidence provided by some neighbours that McInnes' wife, Emily ‚Äì who identifies as a liberal Democrat ‚Äì had harassed and intimidated them, including with the threat of legal action. Her threats were such that several neighbours notified the police. *Weill, Kelly (13 November 2018) \\"Gavin McInnes Whines His Fellow Rich Neighbors Don‚Äôt Like Him\\" The Daily Beast *Rom, Gabriel (29 October 2018) \\"Amy Siskind warns that far-right leader Gavin McInnes lives here\\" The Journal News *Campbell, Andy (4 January 2019) \\"Proud Boys Founder Gavin McInnes Can Get Back To Antifa After He Battles His Neighbors\\" HuffPost *Doughtery, Owen (4 January 2019) \\"Proud Boys founder asked neighbors to take down anti-hate signs: report\\" The Hill *Sommer, Will (4 January 2019) \\"Gavin McInnes Writes Letters to Neighbors to Take Down Anti- Hate Signs\\" The Daily Beast *Campbell, Andy (8 January 2019)\\"Gavin McInnes‚Äô Wife Threatens Neighbors Over ‚ÄòHate Has No Home Here‚Äô Signs\\" HuffPost Lawsuit against the SPLC Although McInnes cut ties with the Proud Boys publicly in November 2018, stepping down as chairman, in February 2019 he filed suit against the Southern Poverty Law Center over their designation of the Proud Boys as a \\"general hate\\" group. The defamation suit was filed in federal court in Alabama. In the papers filed, McInnes claimed that the hate group designation is false and motivated by fund-raising concerns, and that his career has been damaged by it. He claimed that SPLC contributed to his or the Proud Boys' being \\"deplatformed\\" by Twitter, PayPal, Mailchimp, and iTunes.Associated Press (4 February 2019) \\"Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes sues Southern Poverty Law Center over hate group label\\" NBC NewsKennedy, Merrit (5 February 2019) \\"Proud Boys Founder Files Defamation Lawsuit Against Southern Poverty Law Center\\" NPR The SPLC says on its website that \\"McInnes plays a duplicitous rhetorical game: rejecting white nationalism and, in particular, the term 'alt-right' while espousing some of its central tenets,\\" and that the group's \\"rank-and-file [members] and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists. They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric. Proud Boys have appeared alongside other hate groups at extremist gatherings like the 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville.\\" In response to the suit, Richard Cohen, the president of SPLC, wrote \\"Gavin McInnes has a history of making inflammatory statements about Muslims, women, and the transgender community. The fact that he's upset with SPLC tells us that we're doing our job exposing hate and extremism.\\" New York trial of Proud Boys Although McInnes was not a defendant in the August 2019 trial of members of the Proud Boys for their part in the violence that occurred after a meeting of the Metropolitan Republican Club in October 2018, prosecutors repeatedly invoked his name, his words and his views in their questioning of the defendants, after testimony by the defendants and other Proud Boys opened the door to that line of questioning. During closing arguments, a prosecutor said that \\"Gavin McInnes is not a harmless satirist. He is a hatemonger,\\" while the defense said that McInnes was being \\"demonized.\\"Moynihan, Colin (14 August 2019) \\"Far-Right Proud Boys' Founder Called 'Hatemonger'\\" The New York Times Views McInnes describes himself as libertarian and part of the New Right, a term that he prefers rather than alt-right. The New York Times has described McInnes as a \\"far- right provocateur.\\" He has referred to himself as a \\"western chauvinist\\" and started a men's organization called Proud Boys who swear their allegiance to this cause.  In November 2018 it was reported on the basis of an internal memo of the Clark County, Washington Sheriff's Office ‚Äì based on an FBI briefing ‚Äì that the Bureau classified the Proud Boys \\"an extremist group with ties to white nationalism\\". Two weeks later, the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Oregon office denied that the FBI had made that designation about the entire group, ascribing it to a misunderstanding on the part of the Sheriff's Office. The SAIC, Renn Cannon, said that their intent was simply to characterize the possible threat from certain members of the group, not to classify the entire group.Barnes, Luke (7 December 2018) \\"FBI does U-turn on Proud Boys ‚Äòextremist‚Äô label\\" ThinkProgress The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies them as a \\"general hate group\\". McInnes has said his group is not a white nationalist group. In 2003, McInnes said, \\"I love being white and I think it's something to be very proud of. I don't want our culture diluted. We need to close the borders now and let everyone assimilate to a Western, white, English-speaking way of life.\\" Violence In a speech given at New York University in February 2017, after a clash between the Proud Boys and antifa protestors, McInnes said: \\"Violence doesn't feel good, justified violence feels great, and fighting solves everything. ... I want violence. I want punching in the face.\\"Staff (12 December 2018) \\"Proud Boys founder denies inciting violence, responds to whether he feels responsible for group's behavior\\" ABC News He says that he has only advocated for acting in self- defense. Race and ethnicity McInnes has been accused of racism and of promoting white supremacist rhetoric. He has made alleged racial slurs against Susan Rice and Jada Pinkett Smith personally, and more widely against Palestinians and Asians. In September 2004, he told a reporter for the Chicago Reader at a party that he \\"wanted to fuck the shit out of [a young Asian lady] until she started talking.\\" The reporter, Liz Armstrong, wrote: \\"He went on to posit that since Asians' eyes don't work so good in terms of facial expressions they have no choice but to emote with their mouths.\\" McInnes has said that there is a \\"mass conformity that black people push on each other\\". He is also listed as a contributor to the 2016 book Black Lies Matter which criticizes the Black Lives Matter movement. He has been quoted as saying that New Jersey U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who is black, is \\"kind of like Sambo.\\"Moynihan, Colin and Winston, Ali (23 December 2018) \\"Far-Right Proud Boys Reeling After Arrests and Scrutiny\\" The New York Times Judaism and antisemitism In March 2017, during a trip to Israel with The Rebel Media, McInnes made controversial comments defending Holocaust deniers, accused the Jews of being responsible for the Holodomor and the Treaty of Versailles, and said he was \\"becoming anti-Semitic\\". He later said his comments were taken out of context. McInnes also produced a comedic video for Rebel called \\"Ten Things I Hate about Jews\\", later retitled \\"Ten Things I Hate About Israel\\". In response to the controversy, McInnes said: \\"I landed, and I've got tons of Nazi friends. David Duke and all the Nazis totally think I rock... No offence, Nazis, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but I don't like you. I like Jews.\\" Islam McInnes is anti-Islam. He has said that \\"Muslims are stupid ... the only thing they really respect is violence and being tough.\\" He also has equated Islam with fascism, stating \\"Nazis are not a thing. Islam is a thing.\\" In April 2018, McInnes labelled a significant section of Muslims as both mentally ill and incestuous, claiming that \\"Muslims have a problem with inbreeding. They tend to marry their first cousins... and that is a major problem [in the U.S.] because when you have mentally damaged inbreds ‚Äì which not all Muslims are, but a disproportionate number are ‚Äì and you have a hate book called the Koran... you end up with a perfect recipe for mass murder.\\" Gender McInnes has described himself as \\"an Archie Bunker sexist,\\" and has said that \\"95 percent of women would be happier at home\\". On the topic of female police officers, he said, \\"I understand [women] are good for domestics, but I don't understand why there are so many female police officers. They're not strong, they're like super fat police officers. It doesn't make any sense to me.\\" In 2003, Vanessa Grigoriadis in The New York Times quoted McInnes saying, \\"'No means no' is puritanism. I think Steinem-era feminism did women a lot of injustices, but one of the worst ones was convincing all these indie norts that women don't want to be dominated.\\" McInnes has been accused of sexism by various media outlets including Chicago Sun-Times, Independent Journal Review, Salon, Jezebel, The Hollywood Reporter, and Slate. In October 2013, McInnes said during a panel interview that \\"people would be happier if women would stop pretending to be men\\" and that feminism \\"has made women less happy\\". He said, \\"We've trivialized childbirth and being domestic so much that women are forced to pretend to be men. They're feigning this toughness, they're miserable.\\" A heated argument ensued with University of Miami School of Law professor Mary Anne Franks. White genocide McInnes has espoused the white genocide conspiracy theory saying that white women having abortions and immigration is \\"leading to white genocide in the West\\".  In 2018, regarding South African farm attacks and land reform proposals, he said that black South Africans were not \\"trying to get their land back ‚Äì they never had that land\\", instead stating there were \\"ethnic cleansing\\" efforts against white South Africans. Personal life McInnes resides in the U.S. on a green card.

History The foundation stone of Taikoo Dockyard in what is now Taikoo Shing China Navigation Co in 1920 The idea that John Swire and Sons should have their own dockyard in Hong Kong to service, repair, adapt and build vessels for The China Navigation Company was first put forward when the Sugar Refinery was established at Quarry Bay and surplus land remained on that site. The suggestion was made several times in the late 19th century but was opposed by John Samuel Swire as uneconomic and too far outside their usual interests. The need, however, for adequate, reliable and easily available overhaul facilities in the East increased and the dockyard was eventually begun in 1900‚Äì01 at Quarry Bay.The archives of John Swire & Sons, including papers of the Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company, are held at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London: http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/archives/ It was registered in Britain with John Swire & Sons appointed as London Managers, Butterfield & Swire Eastern Managers and Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company as expert advisers. The first ship for CNCo was built by 1910, but it was 16 years before there was a profit on the working account and 20 before a dividend was declared. The dockyard's chief competitor was the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company from whom the new firm faced considerable hostility for many years until a working agreement was reached between them in 1913. Beginning in Colonial Hong Kong, Whampoa Dockyard Company and \\"Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company\\" were crucial for the economy. Together with the United Kingdom, these two docks in Hong Kong built the largest ships in the world in that era. Simultaneously, China had multiple dockyards such as Shanghai Dock and Engineering Company in 1906, Tung Hwa Shipbuilding Works in 1910 and the Shanghai Dockyards Ltd in 1937. Though Hong Kong's dockyards always gave the British complete freedom in ship construction. In the 1930s Shanghai experienced difficult times through events such as the Battle of Shanghai in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Hong Kong's Taikoo Dockyard continued its own government training schools, which were later superseded by Hong Kong's Technical College. By the Second World War other countries finally began building larger ships than Hong Kong. In 1940 the British company went into voluntary liquidation so that a new one could be opened and registered in Hong Kong and the dockyard continued to expand after the Second World War despite the destruction caused by the Japanese in their occupation in 1942‚Äì45. The Swire Group subsequently decided to use the land to develop a large private housing estate, Taikoo Shing. Closing in the early 1970s, the operation later merged with Whampoa Dockyard of Hutchison Whampoa to form a Hong Kong United Dockyard at the west coast of Tsing Yi Island on the western shore of new territories.

Becking did his doctorate in 1920. He worked as a professor at Utrecht from 1929, in Prague from 1930 according to The New Grove. Becking was, along with Joseph and Otmar Rutz, Eduard Sievers, and Alexander Truslit, one of the pioneers of composer pulse theory. This theory combines the rhythmic patterns in music with physical movement. The latter can be represented with conducting curves, so called Becking curves. Becking classified these curves into three categories in which all composers can be placed (Rink 1995 : 64-77).  References  * Gustav Becking (1928/2011): How Musical Rhythm Reveals Human Attitudes.

In modern times, many Greenlandic sharks used for h√°karl production are purchased from fishing ships where the sharks were trapped in the fishing nets. The shark carcass is traditionally fermented in a shallow pit, with stones placed on top of the shark, allowing poisonous internal fluids, like urea and trimethylamine oxide, to be pressed and drained out of the body. The meat is then cured for several months, rendering it safe for human consumption.

Brown is a British-born engineer, humanist and human rights activist. He was president of the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) from 2003 to 2006 and was for a time its main representative at the United Nations, Geneva. Early years Roy Brown was born in London on 2 November 1947. He was educated at the Martin School, East Finchley and The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, an Independent school in Elstree in Hertfordshire, and the University of London where he read Engineering. He trained as an engineer with ITT in London working on the development of electronic systems, and the UK Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Orford Ness and Aldermaston where he was part of the team developing monitoring systems for the international Test Ban Treaty. After emigrating to Canada where he worked for four years with Canadian Marconi in Montreal on the design of airborne radar and navigation systems he returned to the UK as Chief Designer for Racal Research in Tewkesbury, pioneers in the field of Computer Aided Design. Metier Management Systems In 1976, with three colleagues: Richard (Dick) Evans, Robin Lodge and James Miller, Brown founded Metier Management Systems in London, the first company to develop and market mini-computer-based systems for the management of large scale projects. Their first product, Apollo, launched in 1977, was the first Project Management System to run on a minicomputer but was limited to network planning and scheduling. It was joined in 1978 by a sister product, Artemis which incorporated cost and resource management, and became the world's first commercially successful relational database system. By the early 1980s, Artemis systems were in use in over 30 countries providing management information for some of the world's largest civil, aerospace, nuclear and military projects, including the construction of off-shore oil platforms, aircraft development, the construction of five military cities in the Middle East, the maintenance of the US navy fleets at Long Beach and Norfolk Naval Yard, aerospace projects, nuclear power plant maintenance, and production scheduling in the UK and US automobile industries. From 1978 until 1982, as the business grew, Metier developed Artemis systems for other platforms including Hewlett Packard and IBM mainframes. From 1980 Metier embarked on an ambitious programme to develop their own RISC-based computer hardware and a complete software rewrite, to be called Artemis 2. By 1985 when the partners sold the company to the Lockheed Corporation, one of their biggest customers, Metier had 700 employees (of whom 70 were shareholders) and offices in 21 countries. World Population Foundation Brown moved to the Netherlands in 1984 where with his wife Diana he founded the World Population Foundation (WPF) to promote family planning: a major factor in improving the quality of life of women and families, and solving the problems of human development and rapid population growth in developing countries. By 1993 WPF had become one of the leading population advocacy organisations in Europe, and in 1994 played an important role in the Dutch delegation to the International Conference on Population and Development, (ICPD), held in Cairo. In 1996, WPF became a founding member of Eurongo, the European network of NGOs working in the field of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, Population and Development, an organisation first proposed in 1991 by Brown, Sjaak Bavelaar (at that time Executive Director of WPF), and Ann Allport of CARE International. WPF played a significant role in persuading the Dutch government to treble its funding for population assistance in 1998, becoming the largest single donor to the UN Population Fund. In 1999 WPF became more widely known when it was chosen by the UN to host the Hague Forum on Population and Development. WPF continued to grow under the direction of Executive Director Wouter Meijer and by 2004 when he retired, had projects in 16 countries and had opened offices in Pakistan and Viet Nam, employing around 60 staff worldwide. In 1998 Brown handed over the chairmanship of WPF to Nicolaas Biegman, former Dutch ambassador to the UN, but remained on the board until 2012. International Foundation for Population and Development The family moved to Switzerland in 1987. On 1999, together with Christine Magistretti, Charles Riolo and Frederick Naville, Brown became a founding member of the board of the International Foundation for Population and Development based in Lausanne Switzerland. Working with their partner organisation, the Centre for the Study of Social Change, CSSC, in Mumbai, India, IFPD created the WIN program, opening 20 clinics providing primary health care for mothers and their children, family planning, skills training and literacy classes for young women and girls in the slums around Bandra East. As of 2010, WIN was providing services to a population of over 80,000 people. International Humanist and Ethical Union Brown was brought up as a Methodist but became a Humanist when he met his second wife Diana. He became a life member of the British Humanist Association, the National Secular Society and the Council for Secular Humanism, but only became active in the Humanist movement after attending the 14th World Humanist Congress in Mumbai in 1999. He became a member of the IHEU Committee for Growth and Development later the same year and chair of the Committee in 2000. He was elected a vice-president of IHEU in 2001, and president in 2003. He served as president until 2006. Prior to the 50th anniversary of the foundation of IHEU, Brown acted as co- ordinator of the project to update its founding document, the Amsterdam Declaration. The Amsterdam Declaration 2002 was adopted unanimously that year by the 15th World Humanist Congress and the IHEU General Assembly as \\"the official defining statement of World Humanism\\". As president of IHEU Brown initiated a process of decentralisation with the appointment of a number of regional representatives to work closely with the more than 100 IHEU member organisations in over 40 countries. In 2004 in Kampala Uganda he inaugurated the launch of the African Humanist Alliance, uniting Humanist, secular and freethought organisations around Africa. Human Rights at the UN Since 2004 Brown has also served as IHEU Main Representative at the UN, Geneva, where he has worked at the UN Commission on Human Rights and its successor, the Human Rights Council. Brown has prepared written submissions and spoken at the plenary sessions of the Commission and Council on issues as diverse as Female Genital Mutilation, the plight of the Dalits in India, slavery in North Africa, witchcraft and witch hunts in Africa, freedom of expression, the concept of defamation of religion, the incompatibility of the Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam with the Universal Declaration, and the role of the Holy See in attempting to cover up the child abuse scandal and its failure to honour its obligations under the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. A Vision for Europe In 2006 the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, announced plans to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the European Union with a declaration to be known as the Berlin Declaration that was to make reference to Europe's \\"Christian roots\\". The declaration was to be signed by all 27 heads of government of the European Union and would become the preamble to the proposed new European Constitution. Brown proposed a campaign to challenge this potentially divisive idea which promised to neglect not only other faiths but Humanism, secularism and Europe's debt to the Enlightenment. IHEU agreed to work on a joint campaign, \\"A Vision for Europe\\", with the European Humanist Federation and the international NGO Catholics for a Free Choice to create an alternative to the Berlin Declaration, be called \\"the Brussels Declaration\\" to set out Europe's common heritage based on the values of the Enlightenment. Brown was appointed co-ordinator of the campaign. The drafting process ran from October 2006 until January 2007 and involved hundreds of conversations and some 15 preliminary drafts. The Brussels Declaration was presented to the representative of the European presidency at the European Parliament on 27 February 2007, one month before the date of the anniversary celebrations, and addressed to all 27 heads of government with a plea that the values set out in the Brussels Declaration be incorporated into the Berlin Declaration. The campaign was successful. When the Berlin Declaration was promulgated on 27 March 2007, three heads of government refused to sign because the declaration contained no reference to God, religion or Europe's supposed Christian heritage, and the declaration was eventually signed only by Angela Merkel as president of the European Council, Hans-Gert Pottering, president of the European Parliament, and Jose Maunuel Barroso, President of the European Commission. The declaration was then incorporated as the Preamble into the daft of the European Constitution. One of the reasons for the success of the campaign was that rather than attempt to obtain a million or more signatures from ordinary citizens the campaign enlisted the support of 1000 leading Europeans including elder statesmen, religious leaders and Nobel laureates, all with considerable influence in their respective countries. One not entirely unexpected result of the campaign was that a furious Pope Benedict XVI declared that \\"Europe has lost its soul\\" and demanded an invitation to address the European parliament. When the invitation was eventually received however the Pope declined, stating that the Parliament had become \\"too secular\\". Awards 1999, with his wife Diana, Council for Secular Humanism \\"Distinguished Humanists\\" award 2006, the Free Press Prize of the Danish Free Press Society, together with the Norwegian- Pakistani comedian Shabana Rehman. The prize announcement stated that \\"Roy Brown has been a tireless advocate of free speech as part and parcel of human rights. He has thus made an invaluable contribution to the defence of the open society and freedom of expression.\\" In 2008, Brown received the IHEU Distinguished Service to Humanism award for, among other things, his work representing the IHEU at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

It was implemented at the Preslav Literary School, although it was transcribed to Cyril and Methodius. –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–≤–æ–¥–∏ –Ω–∞ –ë–∏–±–ª–∏—è—Ç–∞ (in Bulgarian) The oldest manuscripts use either the so-called Cyrillic or the Glagolitic alphabets. Cyrillic reflects the Greek majuscule writing style of the 9th century with the addition of new characters for Slavic sounds not used in the Greek of that time. Glagolitic writing differs from any other writing system; it went out of use as late as the 20th century. The oldest manuscripts use the Glagolitic script, which is older than the Cyrillic. The oldest manuscripts extant belong to the 10th or 11th century.  Church Slavonic versions  Ivan Fyodorov, 1570 From the Moscow Bible of 1663 The first complete collection of Biblical books in the Church Slavonic language originated in the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the last decade of the 15th century. It was completed in 1499 under the auspices of Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod (in office: 1484‚Äì1504); the translators/compilers of the Old Testament based their work partly on the Vulgate and partly on the Septuagint tradition. The New Testament text relies on the Old Church Slavonic translation. The 1499 Bible, called the Gennady's Bible () is now housed in the State History Museum on Red Square in Moscow. During the 16th century a greater interest arose in the Bible in South and West Russia, owing to the controversies between adherents of the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholics and Greek-Catholics. In the second half of the 16th century the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles, and parts of the Psalter were often printed at Lviv and Vilnius, though the oldest printed edition of the Acts and Epistles was issued at Moscow in 1564. In 1581 Ivan Fyodorov published the first printed edition of the Church Slavonic Bible at Ostrog: Fyodorov's edition used a number of Greek manuscripts, besides Gennady's Bible. But neither the Gennady's nor the Ostrog Bible was satisfactory, and in 1663 a second somewhat revised edition of the latter was published at Moscow ‚Äì the Moscow Bible (–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –ë–∏–±–ª–∏—è). In 1712, Tsar Peter the Great issued an ukaz ordering the printed Slavonic text to be carefully compared with the Greek of the Septuagint and to be made in every respect conformable to it. The revision, completed in 1724, was ordered to be printed, but the death of Peter (1725) prevented the execution of the order. The synodal library in Moscow retains the manuscript of the Old Testament of this revision. Under the Empress Elizabeth the work of revision was resumed by an ukaz issued in 1744, and in 1751 a revised \\"Elizabeth\\" Bible, as it is called, appeared. Three other editions were published in 1756, 1757, and 1759, the second somewhat revised. All later reprints of the Russian Church Bible are based upon this second edition, which has become the authorized version of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Tanzania is on the left, Rwanda on the right. Rusumo Falls () is a waterfall located on the Kagera river on the border between Rwanda and Tanzania, part of the most distant headwaters of the river Nile. The falls are approximately high and wide and have formed on Precambrian schists and quartz‚Äìphyllites. Although the falls themselves are not of significant height in comparison to other waterfalls, they have played an important part in the history of Rwanda because they form the only bridging point on the river in that area.  Significant Events  The falls were the scene of the first arrival of Europeans in Rwanda in 1894, when the German count Gustav Adolf von G√∂tzen came across from Tanzania (Rwanda had been considered part of German East Africa since 1885 but no German had yet entered the country). He continued from there to the palace of the Mwami at Nyanza, and onward to the shores of Lake Kivu.Philip Briggs & Janice Booth (2001) Rwanda: The Bradt Travel Guide p197. Bradt Travel Guides Ltd. and The Globe Pequot Press Inc. A close up of the falls. The Belgians also entered Rwanda via the falls, when they took over the country during World War I in 1916. The bridge at Rusumo was the only feasible crossing of the river at the time, and the Germans had entrenched themselves on the Rwandan side. By taking up positions in the surrounding hills, the Belgians were able to remove these guards using mounted artillery opening up the route by which they invaded the rest of the country. The falls gained international fame during the 1994 Rwandan genocide, as thousands of bodies flowed underneath the Rusumo Bridge while a simultaneous stream of refugees crossed over it, fleeing into Tanzania to escape the slaughter. This was one of the first mass outflows of the Great Lakes refugee crisis. The Kagera drains water from all areas of Rwanda except the far west, and consequently carried all the corpses which had been discarded into rivers nationwide. This led to a state of emergency being declared in areas around the shore of Lake Victoria in Uganda, where these bodies eventually washed up. In 2013 the African Development Bank Group approved funding for the Regional Rusumo Falls Hydropower Project which will increase renewable power generating capacity and access to electricity in Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. The project has two components: an 80 MW hydropower generation plant and transmission lines and substations. The Bank finances the transmission facilities of Rusumo Falls Hydropower Project. http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/afdb-board-commits- us-113-million-to-regional-rusumo-falls-hydropower-project-12610/  References  Category:Kagera River Category:Eastern Province, Rwanda Category:Landforms of Rwanda Category:Waterfalls of Tanzania Category:International waterfalls Category:Rwanda‚ÄìTanzania border Category:Cascade waterfalls ","title":"Rusumo Falls"},{"id":"4532632","text":"Labaroche () is a commune in the Haut-Rhin department in Grand Est in north- eastern France.

Nakamura Taizabur≈ç Nakamura Taizabur≈ç (‰∏≠Êùë Ê≥∞‰∏âÈÉé) was born in 1912 in Yamagata Prefecture. He resided in Tsurumi, Yokohama, where he presided over the International Iai-Batt≈çd≈ç Federation and taught batt≈çd≈ç for the Kakuseikai until his death in 2003. Nakamura was awarded 10th dan hanshi batt≈çd≈ç by the International Martial Arts Federation, 7th dan kyoshi by the All Japan Kend≈ç Federation, 8th dan hanshi, Jukend≈ç and 8th dan hanshi, Tankend≈ç. In 1973 he was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure in recognition for his services in promoting the martial arts. History Nakamura developed batt≈çd≈ç while teaching kenjutsu in northern China. He was inspired by the idea that the eiji happ≈ç (the eight principles of writing kanji) could be applied to swordsmanship. He began to organize his understandings into a system of practical swordsmanship in which non-martial techniques were discarded (much like the practical Toyama-ry≈´ of the early 20th century). The system is based on Nakamura's studies whilst teaching Toyama-ry≈´: bringing the sword blade to a halt after a cut, parrying, progressing to the next combative posture using the sword's kinetic energy. It also makes use of what, through his researches, Nakamura found absent from many other schools of iaid≈ç, kend≈ç, and batt≈çjutsu: the kesagiri, a cut he thought extremely useful.Kesa () is the Japanese term for the upper robe worn by a Buddhist monk. Because the way in which it is worn covers the left shoulder but leaves the right shoulder uncovered, the robe's upper edge passes diagonally across the front (and back) of the torso; hence, kesagiri is a cut made diagonally up or down the body, from approximately the hip to the opposite shoulder, or vice versa. A diagonal cut to the face, etc., is also sometimes called kesagiri. The style The cutting techniques of the Nakamura-ry≈´ are effective in their simplicity: the thrust (either single- or double-handed), the downward vertical cut, left downward diagonal cut, right upward diagonal cut, right downward diagonal cut, left upward diagonal cut, left horizontal cut, and right horizontal cut. The eight cutting techniques are derived from the eiji happ≈ç. Eight chiburi were then incorporated into the system. The basic chiburi used in both Toyama-ry≈´ iaid≈ç and Nakamura-ry≈´ batt≈çd≈ç is actually an en garde position: the sword is snapped down, its point slightly elevated at knee level; from this position, one can maintain zanshin as well as convert easily to a thrust, should the need arise. Nakamura added seven more chiburi, notably from ≈åmori-ry≈´ and Tenshin Sh≈çden Katori Shint≈ç-ry≈´ kenjutsu. The five kamae of kend≈ç/iaid≈ç were also incorporated into the style, to which were added the left-side versions of waki kamae and hasso kamae, and right jodan kamae, making eight kamae altogether.

Biography Coming from a noble family of Champagne, as a youth he was committed to prison for a petty offense. He was liberated on the urging of Fran√ßoise-Marie de Bourbon (1677‚Äì1749), legitimized daughter of Louis XIV of France and Fran√ßoise-Ath√©na√Øs, marquise de Montespan. Fran√ßoise-Marie was also married at the time to Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans. She was thus a well- connected patroness. In 1709, Lestocq arrived in Saint Petersburg in the capacity of a court physician. He was well regarded by Catherine I of Russia until 1720, when her husband had him exiled to Kazan for having seduced a jester's daughter. Upon the Emperor's death, Catherine summoned her favourite physician to the Russian capital, where his light-hearted character made him friends with her daughter Elizaveta Petrovna, whom he reportedly cured of syphilis. More than anyone else, Lestocq helped prepare the 1741 coup d'etat which brought Elizaveta to the throne. He shaped Elizaveta's actions according to the advice of the French ambassador Marquis de La Ch√©tardie and the Swedish ambassador, who were particularly interested in toppling the regime of Anna Leopoldovna, as France sought to counterbalance the Austrian influence at the Russian court and Sweden waged a war against Russia at that time. After Elizaveta's coronation, Lestocq and La Chetardie attempted to dominate state power. The physician received a pension of 15,000 livres from the king of France and sought to influence Russian foreign policy accordingly. Another beneficiary from Lestocq's intrigues was the King of Prussia, who persuaded Emperor Charles VII to make him an imperial count. In 1743, Lestocq forged the so-called Lopukhina Conspiracy to engineer the downfall of Chancellor Aleksey Bestuzhev. It was he who suggested Sophie Augusta Fredericka of Anhalt-Zerbst (the future Catherine the Great), a Prussian prot√©g√©, as a bride for the heir apparent. In 1745 Bestuzhev, still in power, succeeded in intercepting Lestocq's correspondence with La Chetardie, which resulted in the latter being banished from Russia. Three years later Lestocq, who continued to intrigue against Bestuzhev, was accused of plotting to dethrone Elizaveta in favor of the Prussophile heir to the throne. He and his aide de camp, Alexander Chappuzeau, nephew of his brother Johann Ludwig von L‚ÄôEstocq, were both arrested. L'Estocq was tortured in the Secret Chancellery and sentenced to death. The Empress intervened and had him instead exiled, first to Uglich and then to Veliky Ustyug. Only upon her death was Lestocq restored to his estates and allowed to return to the Russian capital. Lestocq was married first to Barbara von Rutenhjelm, then to Alida M√ºller, described as 'dirty and drunken', who died in November 1743.M√©moires du prince Pierre Dolgoroukow, by Pierre Dolgoroukow, Cherbuliez et H.

Character profile He is a member of the Evil Horde, he was packaged as the \\"evil energy-draining insectoid.\\" He is a cyborg creature with a long, pointed metal head, with a needle on the end of the nose-piece which he injects into his opponents to drain the blood from them. He has a transparent metallic chest through which the blood of his opponent can be seen, filling him up to charge him with energy. 1980s toy line Mosquitor was introduced into the MotU toy line in 1987. He was one of the final figures to be released before the toy line's demise, and as a result is one of the rarest. The action figure's special feature is a switch on its back, which when pressed caused his chest to flow with blood. The figure came packaged with the mini-comic \\"Enter: Buzz-Saw Hordak!\\" The comic reveals him as a new minion of Hordak, and his main function in the story is draining the energy of the Sorceress, enabling Hordak to create a fake, holographic Sorceress from her life force. At a later stage in the story, he is set upon He-Man, and almost overpowers him. The comic also hints at a tension between himself and Dragstor; after serving as a test object for Mosquitor's ability, Dragstor clearly resents Mosquitor's great power and his value to Hordak. Mosquitor also appears in the MotU Marvel comics, where he is able to fly and shoot beams from the needle of his nose- piece. Given that he was released so late into the toyline's run, Mosquitor's exposure was minimal throughout the various story media and he never made an animated appearance. The action figure first released by Mattel in 1987 is a very rare and sought after collectors item today. Its rare existence can be attributed to being released very late into the toy series original run. The mint condition (known as MOC / Mint on Card) version of this figure can fetch high dollars on auction sites such as eBay. 2002 toy line He also did not appear in the updated cartoon series Masters of the Universe vs. The Snake Men, produced in 2002 by Mike Young Productions, or in its tie-in comics. The Horde were intended to be released among the next wave of villains and fill the role of main opposition to He-Man in the show's third season. The second- season episode \\"The Power of Grayskull\\" features the Horde in a flashback sequence, as an evil force from Ancient Eternia. However, since the toy line and cartoon were canceled shortly afterwards, the third season was never made. Mosquitor was released by NECA as part of Series 6 of the Masters of the Universe series of ministatues designed by Four Horsemen Studios. Reception Mosquitor was voted No.6 in The 10 Most Unfortunate Masters Of The Universe Toys by Io9. Mosquitor was voted by Mania.com as the second most Crazy Masters of the Universe Figures.

Francis Lavigne, an Ontario community college teacher complained that the Ontario Public Service Employees Union was using union dues for purposes to which he disagreed. He claimed this infringed his rights under the freedom of expression section of the Charter. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously against him but the seven judges used different reasons to apply the ruling. Background Francis Lavigne had been a teacher at an Ontario community college. Lavigne was not a member of the Ontario Public Services Employees Union (OPSEU) and not required to be. Lavigne did not oppose the Rand formula requirement to pay dues but did oppose the use of some of his dues for activities unrelated to a union's core workplace causes.B Jamie Cameron The ‚ÄòSecond Labour Trilogy‚Äô: A Comment Supreme Court Law Review, Vol. 16 (2002), pp. 67-102 The Canadian Civil Liberties Association intervened to support the union position, saying \\"Lavigne's protection is in his right to join or not to join the organization; and to use or not use the democratic process [of the organization].\\"CCLA submission Under the union's constitution they were allowed to use the fees collected towards the advancement of the \\"common interests, economic, social and political, of the members and of all public employees, wherever possible, by all appropriate means\\". OPSEU put some of the money towards interests such as disarmament campaigns, the National Union of Mine Workers in the United Kingdom, health care workers' union in Nicaragua, and sponsored events for the New Democratic Party. The practice was not unusual for similar unions, nonetheless, Lavigne opposed many of the causes supported by OPSEU. He brought an application for declaratory relief against the union on the basis that the Colleges Collective Bargaining Act, which gave the unions power to allocate funds to causes of their choosing, violated his right to freedom of expression and association under section 2(b) and 2(d) of the Charter. The Supreme Court of Canada considered the following issues: # Whether the Charter applied. # If so, whether the payments to the OPSEU infringed his freedom of expression guarantee under section 2(b) of the Charter. # Whether the payments to the OPSEU infringed his freedom of association under section 2(d) of the Charter. # If any violation is found, whether the violation can be saved under section 1 of the Charter. Opinion of the Court The Court unanimously held that the Charter did apply. They also decided that there was no violation, but for different reasons. Justice La Forest, with Sopinka and Gonthier, held that there was a violation of freedom of association (section 2(d) of the Charter) but that it was justified under section 1. He also held that the use of the union funds did not constitute forced expression, and so there was no violation of the freedom of expression. Justice Wilson, with L‚ÄôHeureux-Dube, held that there was no violation at all, and if there was it would be saved under section 1. She disagreed with La Forest by finding that the use of the union funds did have expressive content, but the payments did not imply that Lavigne supported any of the union's causes and did not prevent him from expressing his own personal views. Accordingly, there was no violation of the freedom of expression. Justice Cory and Justice McLachlin, writing separate decisions, each held there was no violation.

It was written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins in 1998. It was published on Monday, February 1, 1999, and was on The New York Times Best Seller List for 20 weeks. It takes place 27‚Äì38 months into the Tribulation. Plot introduction The prologue is the last two pages of Soul Harvest. Plot summary Cameron \\"Buck\\" Williams and Rayford Steele have become international fugitives. New believers like Condor 216 first officer Mac McCullum and computer programmer David Hassid take their places as moles in the Global Community (GC) and use his infrastructures to evangelize and thwart Carpathia's attempts to find members of the Tribulation Force. Ray and Ken Ritz go to the States to check in on Hattie Durham and the safe house. Hattie confesses to Rayford that Amanda White was entirely innocent of supposed collaboration with Carpathia - the e-mail texts were simply an elaborate smear campaign ordered by Carpathia himself. At the prophesied conference of witnesses, held at Teddy Kollek Stadium and hosted by Tsion Ben-Judah, the Potentate makes an unwelcome visit. At this time, Israel's water turns to blood, which Carpathia blames on the Two Witnesses. Jacov, Chaim Rosenzweig's driver, becomes a believer; later that night he is found in a bar, telling people that Jesus is Messiah. The next day at the conference, Tsion tells the audience they are waiting for the next Trumpet Judgment, in which the sun, moon, and stars will darken by 1/3. He also explains that 3/4 of the population since the Rapture will die prior to the end of the Tribulation. The last night of the conference, the Two Witnesses appear at the stadium. Then a GC attack breaks out while the Trib. Force retreats to Chaim's estate which, being an old embassy, has a helipad. Ken flies to the house in GC1, Nicolae's helicopter, and gets the force into the chopper. While transferring the force at the airport, Ken Ritz is shot trying to give Rayford as much time as he needs. Hattie, now desperate to live only for the life of her child, is raced to a hospital, where they meet another believer named Leah Rose. She and Tribulation Force physician Floyd Charles try to deliver the baby, but after some work, the baby is stillborn. According to Floyd, Hattie had been poisoned by Carpathia, resulting in the death of her child. Buck is still in Israel after a failed attempt to get him on the plane, returning to Chaim's estate. A few days later, the fourth Trumpet Judgement strikes, and the world gets considerably colder, delaying Buck's return to the States. During the GC news report, Chaim, though still a skeptic, tells about the truth of the judgments, endorses Tsion's lesson and tells the world about his website. Rayford goes to Palwaukee Airport after the judgment lifts to sort out Ken Ritz's affairs. He must deal with the not-very-smart Bo Hanson and his friend Ernie, who it turns out has faked the mark of the believer to gain access to Ken's stash of money, which is very large. As they argue, the fifth Trumpet Judgement falls and a horde of demonic locusts swarm the earth, attacking everyone who does not bear the mark of the believer, in which it is so horrible that men try to kill themselves but are not allowed to die. Rayford meets T.M. Delanty, who is almost the full owner of Palwaukee and a believer. As the months pass and the locusts continue to attack, Chloe's pregnancy comes to an end. Buck is still in Jerusalem trying to get Chaim to accept Jesus, but returns home in time for the birth of his child.

He is known for the cavalry regiment called 36th Jacob's Horse, and for founding the town of Jacobabad, in modern day Pakistan, where he planned and supervised the transformation of thousands of acres of desert into arable land over the course of twenty years. The scale of progress and prosperity his works brought to the region can be appreciated by comparing those regions' relative prosperity compared to areas which were not under his administrative jurisdiction. Early life He was born at Woolavington, in the county of Somerset, England, where his father the Reverend Stephen Long Jacob was incumbent. His mother was Susanna, daughter of the Reverend James Bond of Ashford, Kent, England. He was schooled by his father until he obtained his cadetship to Addiscombe Military Seminary.Through the good offices of his cousin, Capt William Jacob of the Bombay Artillery in February 1826. His elder brother, Herbert, was then also serving out in India as a new subaltern. HT Lambrick, John Jacob of Jacobabad, reprint, Karachi, 1975, of original edition, p.7 A number of the young cadets there who were his contemporaries, included such famous officers as Eldred Pottinger, Robert Cornelis Napier, Henry Mortimer Durand, Vincent Eyre and others.Lambrick, p.8 He was commissioned into the Bombay Artillery (Bombay Army) on his 16th birthday, and subsequently sailed for India in January 1828, never to set foot in England again. Afghan War Brigadier General John Jacob, CB. Marble bust at Taunton Shire Hall After seven years employed with his regiment, he was then employed as subordinate to the collector of Gujarat. In 1838 he was ordered to Sind with the Bombay column, to join the army of the Indus at the outbreak of the First Anglo-Afghan War. He first saw active service in the summer of 1839 as a subaltern of artillery, the force led by Sir John Keane, sent to invade the Upper Sindh. He was given command of the Sind Horse by Sir James Outram in 1841; in 1842 he was additionally placed in political charge of the whole of the Cutchee frontier. He saw his first major action as Brevet Captain at the Battle of Meanee, with the British force sent to conquer Sindh. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He set about to recruit a second regiment of Sind Horse, which Napier announced in a letter dated 28 November 1846 would be called Jacob's Horse. As Irregular Cavalry, each regiment had only three European officers, a system that Jacob argued should be extended to all Indian cavalry regiments. Both regiments were absorbed into the Indian Army in 1860 and ultimately became the 35th Sind Horse and the 36th Jacob's Horse. They saw active service in Northern and Central India, Persia and Afghanistan, and during World War I in France. They were amalgamated in 1921 and became known as the 14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse. Transforming the Village of Khangarh to City of Jacobabad In 1847 Jacob was placed in political charge of the frontier and established his headquarters at Khangurh. At the time he set foot on there, the area was known as Upper Sind 'desert', littered with marauders who looted for living. At the first place he restored peace in the area by thoroughly defeating the predator tribes. Then he started building infrastructure for the town, (at the village of Khangurh and its surroundings). Being an architect and an engineer himself, he designed and then executed the plans of laying a wide road network around the town that measured a good 600 miles (965 km). In that he resolved the problem of unavailability of potable water for the residents by excavating a tank that contained water brought from Indus through a canal. His biggest and most important feat was the excavation of Begaree Canal, originating from Guddu barrage on river Indus, going round the district irrigating thousands of acres of land previously uncultivated, thereby providing means of living to thousands of people. As a Military Engineer He wrote many pamphlets which were critical of the Indian Army as it then was, and got him into much trouble with the Government in London. He was a scientist and inventor, developing an exploding bullet, or shell, that fired combustibles up to .He believed this would revolutionize the art of war. Two good riflemen could, in his opinion, annihilate the best battery of field artillery in 10 minutes. Further experiments made it possible to fire shells up to a range of 14 miles. More importantly, he designed a four grooved rifle and had various experimental guns manufactured in London by leading gunsmiths, and at his expense. In April 1855 he was gazetted Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1856, due to Sir Bartle Frere's poor health, he taking leave in England, Jacob was pronounced Acting Commissioner in Sind. Persian War At the outbreak of the Anglo-Persian War, Jacob was put in charge of the cavalry and departed for Persia. He was raised to the rank of Brigadier-General, and appointed Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria. When he arrived at Bushire, General Stalker having suddenly died, Jacob was put in charge of 3000 men. Peace favourable to the British Government having been negotiated, Jacob was left in charge of conducting the evacuation of Bushire. A month after the end of hostilities with the Persians, the Indian rebellion of 1857 had broken out; Jacob's Horse remained loyal throughout. He was anxious to return to India, as he had been selected for the command of the Central Indian Army. He was delayed in Bushire on the insistence of the British minister there, and Lord Elphinstone was unable to await his arrival; the command was given to Sir Hugh Rose instead. Jacob returned to Jacobabad where he raised two regiments of infantry. The 130th Baluchis and 26th Jacob's Mountain Battery are named after him. He died of ill health at Jacobabad on 6 December 1858. He was buried in the town where his grave has been well-maintained by the locals for whom he retains a cult status, and, according to BBC correspondent Mark Tully locals believed he had saintlike status. Legacy Mausoleum of John Jacob Though Gen John Jacob had undoubtedly his professional sincerities to the British Rule but his emotional links with the people and the area were deep-rooted, thereby believing in involving the locals in works of common good, a virtue not so common in the officers of British Raj. He put those men to work, for themselves, who would prefer to starve rather than touching a spade or a hoe. His formula was simple, yet effective. He would divide the work into small chunks and distribute it among families who, being dead sure on fair return on their hardwork, completed the tasks very honestly and well in time. Jacob noted in one of his writings that he saw the men working well into the night without any order or obligation from the authority. Known as a man of justice, humanity, eccentricity and marvelous talents, Jekum Sahib Bahadur' never advocated exploiting the labour by no or paltry wages and he believed it would bring nothing but chaos and ever-decreasing revenue over a certain area or headcount. It was his subjects who took to calling the new settlement 'Jekumbad' after their much admired 'Jekum Sahib Bahadur.' And Jekumbad it is even today on the lips of the illiterate. Controversy arose over a pamphlet he published \\"Letters to a Lady on the Progress of Being\\" which presented an early version of evolutionary theory. He resisted claims from clergy serving in India that he was attempting to undermine Christian faith. (source The Saturday Review 1858 \\"General Jacob on the Progress of Being\\" Not long after Jacob‚Äôs death the simple grave turned into a shrine for Muslims and Hindus alike for an oil lamp could be seen burning at its head. This practice, according to Lambrick,Lambrick, p. 5, footnote was discontinued on the orders of the Executive Engineer in the 1930s for the oil from the lamp left a messy stain on the grave. But still, many of the Baloch villagers visit the tomb, pray for the health of an ailing child or for happiness and wealth. Among his descendants, were Lt. Gen. Sir Ian Jacob, KBE, CB, a former Director-General of the BBC, Prof. E. F. Jacob, a historian; and Doctor Gordon Jacob, the composer.

Plot Thomas Smithers (Postlethwaite), who has made his fortune as an ironmonger and cannon-maker, hires the famous Meneer Chrome (McGregor) to create the most extravagant garden imaginable on his overgrown property. Smithers doesn't know that his wife's cousin Fitzmaurice (Grant) has already hired Chrome, with the goal of bankrupting Smithers and essentially acquiring Juliana, whom he loves. Juliana, however, is attracted to Chrome and he in turn to the Smithers' daughter, Anna, who filters all experiences through a volume of Andrew Marvell's poems that she is never without. Her parents, thinking her mentally unstable, subject her to numerous \\"treatments\\" that prompt Chrome's compassion. As the garden grows increasingly complex and Smithers approaches bankruptcy, Fitzmaurice realizes that Chrome's affection for Anna makes him a liability; he threatens to reveal some damaging information about Chrome and then decides to kill him, but his plan backfires and Fitzmaurice dies.

The Samoa Islands. University of Hawaii Press. Page 440. . Etymology In the Samoan language, faga translates to ‚Äúbay‚Äù, while togo means ‚Äúmangrove tree.‚Äù A mangrove swamp was located in the village, which stretched from Fagatogo Market to the fuel dock. At the beginning of the 20th century, most mangrove trees had been removed in order to make room for a new wharf and coaling station constructed by the U.S. Naval Administration. History right right U.S. Naval Station Tutuila, c. 1920. High Court of American Samoa. American interest in Tutuila Island began with the American Samoan Treaty of 1878 which provided the United States with a non-exclusive right to establish a naval station on the Pago Pago Bay. The United States recognized the need to create a naval coaling station on the shipping route between Hawai'i and New Zealand, and shortly after the treaty proceeded to rent land in Pago Pago at $10 a month. In 1889, Rear Admiral L.A. Kimberly USN visited Tutuila and selected a site for a future U.S. naval station. Roughly seventeen acres of land were purchased for a total price of $3,241.79. The construction of the wooden-floored steel dock, storehouse and manager's dwelling did not commerce for another ten years. A water reservoir in the hills behind the station was also constructed, and the expansion of the site begun by filling in Pago Pago Bay to the edge of the fringing reef. The Naval Station was made up of eight shorefront acres as of 1907. The official U.S. Naval Station occupation began by the signing of the Deed of Cession by the High Chiefs on Tutuila- and Aunu'u Islands and the raising of the United States Flag on April 17 in 1900. By the end of the navy administration period in 1951, the Naval Station occupied 216 acres and was made up of 105 structures. As of 2001, only twelve of the structures remained. Most remaining naval structures were entered onto the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as a part of the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila Historic District. The naval commandant, ship's crew, and officers all originally lived on board the station ship. A concrete building was built near the station dock in 1902 serving as the first customs house. This structure was replaced by the present-day larger customhouse in 1920, which is located along the waterfront to the southwest of the station dock, known as Navy Building No. 67. This Customhouse, which measures 150 by 80 feet, is located on the waterfront. As with other Naval Station buildings of this period, it was made of locally manufactured concrete blocks molded to imitate rough-cut stone. Until the introduction of the commercial air transportation in 1959, the Customhouse operated as the point-of-entry for all visitors to American Samoa. This was also the site of the territory's only execution, which took place in 1939 when a condemned murderer was hanged here. The front portion of the present-day Jean P. Haydon Museum was originally the Commissary Store, known as Navy Building No. 43, which was erected in 1919. The rear portion of the museum was originally a garage (Navy Building No. 24). When the Department of Interior took over governance of American Samoa in 1951, the commissary in Fagatogo became the Pago Pago Post Office. A new post office was constructed across the William McKinley Memorial Highway in 1971, and the former commissary and garage were consequentially converted into a museum, named after the wife of Governor John Morse Haydon. The west wing of the structure was extended in order to add an exhibit space, and a mural in front of the west wing was made by artist Sven Ortquist and depicts a scene from Samoan mythology. A traditional Samoan fale was set up in front of the museum entrance. Government House is located between Fagatogo and Utulei. Two 450-foot high radio towers were situated where the present-day Historic District Pedestrian Park is found, near the historic Radio Station known as Navy Building No. 38. This building now serves as the Territorial Registrar's Office and was erected in 1917 during World War I. The structure, which measures 60 square feet, was the first to be built with faux-rock cement blocks. This building was altered in the 1970s in order to accommodate Amerika Samoa Bank. The present-day malae (‚ÄúMalae o le Talu‚Äù), a large grassy area on the south side of the road, serves as the ceremonial center for City of Pago Pago. During the Navy days, it was known as the Parade Ground and was the site of training and performances by the Fita Fita Guard and Band. A small bandshell was found at the far end of the malae. The former Parade Ground, which measures 210 by 500 feet, is now listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and is part of the Naval Station Historic District. Present-day Department of Public Safety, which sits across from the malae, is a two-story white structure with an arched Mission Revival-style first-floor veranda. This building was originally erected in 1908 by the Fita Fita Guard and was known was the Fita Fita Barracks (Navy Building No. 31). Immediately west of the former barracks is the former Samoan Jail (Navy Building No. 72), which now serves as offices of Interpol and regional law enforcement agencies OTICIDE and SPICIN. Although it remains unknown when the jail originally was built, it was in existence by 1917 when the United States went to war with Germany. During the war, the commandant seized two German ships in Pago Pago Harbor and enlisted the crews in the jail. The building is a one-story structure of poured, reinforced concrete, similar to the floor of the Fita Fita Barracks. It measures fifty square feet. Fagatogo is home to The Fono (legislature). A portion of the docks at Fagatogo in Pago Pago Harbor. In the background is the tallest peak on Tutuila, Matafao Peak. Immediately west of the Samoan Jail facing the parade ground is the old Bake Shop, known as Navy Building No. 45. The commandant called for the construction of a new bakery in 1913, claiming the existing bakery was a disgrace to the station and unsanitary. The bakery was therefore constructed in 1919 in this one-story building measuring forty square feet. The present-day building now houses the Samoa Photo Express and Western Union. Further down the main street on the bayside is the Maota Fono complex, now the home of the American Samoa Legislature. The original Fono was across the malae in a former Naval barrack, now home of the Amerika Samoa Bank. When the Fono burned down in 1970, the Fono consequentially moved to its new structures in 1973. Between present-day Scanlan's Inn and T&K; General Merchandise is a cement path that leads up to the Catholic Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph the Worker. The cathedral was erected in 1959. A larger white church is situated slightly west of the malae, known as the Congregational Christian Church or Key to the Kingdom of Heaven (‚ÄúO Le Ki O Le Malo O Le Lagi‚Äù). Built on the former location of an older London Missionary Society church, built in 1904. The cornerstone of this church was laid in 1933, but due to construction being interrupted by World War II, the church was not dedicated and completed until 1949. The church went through an extensive two-year renovation in 1994. In front of and slightly to the east is the refurbished High Court Building, originally known as the Naval Station Administration Building or Naval Building No. 21, constructed in 1904. When the structure was restored in 1998 at the cost of $1.2 million, much work was done to replicate the original exterior design and color scheme of the building. Much of the former interior woodwork was also preserved and restored, including the skylight and central staircase. In 2011, the Government of American Samoa received federal grants in the amount of $495,416 in order to improve Pago Pago's downtown area around the Malae o le Talu in Fagatogo. Areas to be improved included the Department of Public Safety's (DPS) back road, as well as roads which lead from the upper ranches of Fagatogo to the Malae. Demographics Congregational Christian Church in Fagatogo The population is more ethnically diverse than any other village in American Samoa. A majority of the village's residents are Samoans, attributed to the members of original families. Also, immigrants from places such as Western Samoa, the Philippines, Tonga, Fiji, South Korea, Europe, China, and mainland United States are residents of Fagatogo. The village had 1,737 inhabitants as of the 2010 U.S. Census, down from 2,096 which was recorded at the 2000 U.S. Census. Around 85% of the village's residents were under 50 years of age. From 1980 to 1990, the population of Fagatogo grew from 1,944 to 2,323 inhabitants. The proportion of residents born outside of American Samoa was 23 percent in the early 1980s. This proportion increased to 41 percent between 1985-1990, and the proportion of residents born outside of American Samoa reached 52 percent in 1990.http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/basch/uhnpscesu/pdfs/sam/Pedersen2000vol2AS.pdf (Page 24-22) As of the 2000 U.S. Census, 81.6% of Fagatogo's population were of Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Island race. 12.5% were Asian, while 3.6% were white.Census of population and housing (2000): American Samoa Summary Social, Economic, and Housing Characteristics (2000).

She was the winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award (1983), the Jnanpith Award (2000)Jnanpith Award Presented, The Hindu, 25 February 2002 . and Principal Prince Claus Laureate (2008). A celebrated writer of contemporary Indian literature, many of her works have been translated into English from her native Assamese which include The Moth Eaten Howdah of the Tusker, Pages Stained With Blood and The Man from Chinnamasta. She was also well known for her attempts to structure social change, both through her writings and through her role as mediator between the armed militant group United Liberation Front of Asom and the Government of India. Her involvement led to the formation of the People's Consultative Group, a peace committee. She referred to herself as an \\"observer\\" of the peace process rather than as a mediator or initiator. Her work has been performed on stage and in film. The film Adajya is based on her novel won international awards. Words from the Mist is a film made on her life directed by Jahnu Barua. Goswami in inauguration ceremony of a 2nd India Saraswati temple at Bijoy Nagar, Guwahati Early life and education Indira Goswami was born in Guwahati to Umakanta Goswami and Ambika Devi, a family that was deeply associated with Sattra life of the Ekasarana Dharma. She studied at Latashil Primary School, Guwahati; Pine Mount School, Shillong; and Tarini Chaudhury Girls' School, Guwahati and completed Intermediate Arts from Handique Girls College, Guwahati. She majored in Assamese literature at Cotton College in Guwahati and secured a master's degree from Gauhati University in the same field of study. Indira goswami impressed by Akka Mahadevi's Kannada vachanas as she said in Bengaluru. Career In 1962, she published her first collection of short stories, \\"Chinaki Morom\\", when she was a student. Popularly known as Mamoni Baideo in Assam, she was encouraged by editor Kirti Nath Hazarika who published her first short stories ‚Äî when she was still in Class VIII (thirteen years old) ‚Äî in the literary journal he edited. Depression Goswami has suffered from depression since her childhood. In the opening pages of her autobiography, The Unfinished Autobiography, she mentions her inclination to jump into Crinoline Falls located near their house in Shillong.Adha Lekha Dastabej, 1983, Students' Stores, Guwahati Repeated suicide attempts marred her youth. After the sudden death of her husband, Madhaven Raisom Ayengar of Karnataka, in a car accident in the Kashmir region of India, after only eighteen months of marriage, she became addicted to heavy doses of sleeping tablets.Confessions : Indira Goswami Once brought back to Assam, she joined the Sainik School, Goalpara as a teacher. At this point she went back to writing. She claims that she wrote just to live and that otherwise it would not have been possible for her to go on living. Her experiences in Kashmir and Madhya Pradesh, Indian states where her husband had worked as an engineer, were used in her novels Ahiron and The Chehnab's Current, respectively. Life in Vrindavan After working at the Sainik School in Goalpara, Assam, she was persuaded by her teacher Upendra Chandra Lekharu to come to Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh, and pursue research for peace of mind. Her experiences as a widow as well as a researcher finds expression in her novel The Blue Necked Braja (1976), which is about the plight of the Radhaswamis of Vrindavan who lived in abject poverty and sexual exploitation in everyday life. One of the main issues that the novel touches upon is the plight of young widows for whom companionship beyond the confines of their ashrams and fellow widows become impossible. Their urge to live, as well as the moral dilemma that they face vis-a-vis the order of precepts of religion in this regard, are brought out with astonishing clarity and feeling in the novel. The novel exposed the uglier face of Vrindavan ‚Äì the city of Krishna, a Hindu deity ‚Äì inviting criticism of Goswami from conservative sections of the society. It remains a classic in modern Indian literature. It is autobiographical in character as she says the anguish of the main character Saudamini, reflects what she had gone through after her husband had died. It was also the first novel to be written on this subject. The novel was based on Goswami's research on the place as well as real-life experience of living in the place for several years before she joined the University of Delhi as a lecturer. In Vrindavan she was involved in Ramayana studies. A massive volume of Tulsidas's Ramayana purchased during her stay there for just eleven rupees was a great source of inspiration in her research. This finds expression in her book Ramayana from Ganga to Brahmaputra, an unparalleled comparative study of Tulsidas's Ramayana and the fourteenth-century Assamese Ramayanathe first Ramayana to be written in any modern Indian language written by Madhava Kandali. Life at the University of Delhi Goswami relocated to Delhi, India, to become Professor of Assamese in the Modern Indian Languages & Literary Studies(MIL) Department at the University of Delhi under the guidance of her lifelong mentor Prof. Bhabananda Deka, who was subservient in the introduction of Assamese Language in MIL Department of Delhi University (DU).Dr Mamoni Raisom Goswami , Assamportal.com While at the university, she wrote most of her greatest works. Several short stories, including Hridoy, Nangoth Sohor, Borofor Rani, used Delhi as the background. During later part of her life, after she became Head of the MIL Department in Delhi University, she, in collaboration with award-winning Assamese popular short-story writer and novelist Arnab Jan Deka made efforts and persuaded Delhi University to set up a Chair in the name of Middle Age Assamese saint-philosopher-litt√©rateur- artist Srimanta Sankardev. They also convinced the Chief Minister of Assam to make a contribution of Rupees One Million to Delhi University to create the corpus for the proposed Chair. However, Dr Goswami could not see the fruits of her effort during her lifetime. Her two classics ‚Äì Pages Stained With Blood and The Moth Eaten Howdah of a Tusker‚Äî were also written during this period. The other books completed while she lived in Delhi were Ahiron,The Rusted Sword, Uday Bhanu, Dasharathi's Steps and The Man from Chinnamasta. In Pages Stained With Blood she writes about the plight of Sikhs in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots following the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India. Goswami had witnessed the riots while staying in the Shakti Nagar area of Delhi. She visited many of the other sites to complete this novel. She even went to G. B. Road, Delihi's red-light district, to depict the lives of the prostitutes who lived there which forms a part of her novel. In The Moth Eaten Howdah of a Tusker she writes about the plight of Assamese Brahmin widows in Satra, religious institutions of Assam. This novel was anthologised in The Masterpieces of Indian Literature and was made into a film, Adajya, which won several national and international film-festival awards. The novel was also made into two television mini-series; Nandita Das played the role of Giribala in one of the mini-series. At the peak of her literary career she wrote the controversial novel The Man from Chinnamasta, a critique of the thousand- years-old tradition of animal sacrifice in the famous Hindu Shakti temple to Kamakhya, a mother goddess, in Assam. Goswami reported that there was even threat to her life after writing the novel. In this novel she quotes scriptures to authenticate the argument she puts forward in the novel ‚Äì to worship the Mother Goddess with flowers rather than blood. She said in an interview, \\"When the novel was serialized in a popular magazine, I was threatened with dire consequences. Shortly after this, a local newspaper, Sadin, carried an appeal about animal sacrifice, which resulted in quite an uproar‚Äîthe editor was gheraoed and a tantrik warned me. But when the appeal was published, the response was overwhelmingly in favour of banning animal sacrifice. I also had to contend with rejection from a publisher who was initially keen and had promised me a huge advance, but who later backtracked, offering instead to publish any other book of mine. But the rest, as they say, is history and Chinnamastar Manuhto went on to become a runaway bestseller!\\" Another major piece of her fiction during the period was Jatra (The Journey), based on the problem of militancy/secessionism that has affected almost the entire North-East India frontier ever since Indian independence. Mamoni Raisom Goswami died at the Gauhati Medical College Hospital on 29 November 2011. Success She received the Sahitya Akademi Award (1982). She received the Jnanpith Award (2000), India's highest literary award, for writing about the subalterns and marginalised. Two of the main features in Goswami's writing has been the focus on women and the cultural and political construct of the Assamese society. However, it is also to her credit that she also created possibly one of the finest male characters in contemporary Assamese literature, viz. the character of Indranath in Datal Hantir Une Khowa Howdah (The Moth Eaten Howdah of a Tusker). Her contribution in the Assamese feminist literature is self-evident in this work. She takes up the issue of patriarchy existing within Assamese Brahmin families with an illustration taken from a small place in Assam known as Amranga, Borihat. This work is also encrusted with a post-colonial tinge in it as we see the mimicry of the colonizers among the colonised. It is also to her credit that she made extensive use of the relation between different variants of the modern Assamese language as both signifiers of the politics of social and cultural differences among the various Assamese communities. But the overall emphasis remained on the unity of the Assamese identity. This may be taken as her way of dealing with the nature of contemporary politics in Assam marked by ethnic confrontation, besides the larger politics of the militant secessionism. She also contributed a major sum of the Claus Laureate[2008] to a Public Health Centre of Amranga, Borihat in Assam. This contribution is not merely material in its nature but a dream since her childhood, come true.

It emulates different types of computer terminals, from DEC VT100 to DEC VT382. It supports telnet, SSH 1 & 2 and serial port connections. It also has a built-in macro scripting language (supporting Oniguruma regular expressions) and a few other useful plugins. History The first versions of Tera Term were created by T. Teranishi from Japan. At the time, it was the only freely available terminal emulator to effectively support the Japanese language. Original development of Tera Term stopped in the late 1990s at version 2.3, but other organizations have created variations. In October 2002, Ayera Technologies released TeraTerm Pro 3.1.3 supporting SSH2 and added multiple other features like a built-in web server for API integration with external systems, recurring \\"keep-alive\\" commands, and ODBC database support via the TT Macro Scripting Language. Ayera Technologies did not make their source open, but does provide limited technical support. In 2004, Yutaka Hirata, a software designer from Japan, restarted development of the open source version of Tera Term. He added his own implementation of SSH2 and many new features on top of what was part of version 2.3. To avoid confusion with version numbers and to indicate that Tera Term developed by Yutaka was more recent than version 3.1.3 from Ayera Technologies, it was decided to give this branch of Tera Term Professional version numbers starting 4.xx. In January 2005, Boris Maisuradze, together with Yutaka Hirata, started the TeraTerm Support forum where they answered questions from Tera Term users. Posting in this forum was the best way to suggest new features for Tera Term or propose new commands for the Tera Term Macro language. For more than 10 years the forum was hosted on LogMeTT.com website maintained by Boris Maisuradze. Boris also developed several freeware tools that became part of TeraTerm package. Later Boris decided to retire from this project. LogMeTT.com website was shut down and support forums moved to TeraTerm Project site. Since 2007, Tera Term has been maintained by Tera Term Project (Japanese Developer team) as open source software.

Jewish anarchism encompasses various expressions of anarchism within the Jewish community.  Secular Jewish anarchism  Many people of Jewish origin, such as Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Martin Buber, Paul Goodman, Murray Bookchin, David Graeber, and Noam Chomsky have played a role in the history of anarchism. However, as well as these anarchists of Jewish origin, there have also been specifically Jewish anarchist movements, within the Yiddish-speaking communities of Eastern and Central Europe, and the Western cities to which they migrated, from the late nineteenth century until the Second World War. All the members of the first anarchist group in the Russian Empire, which was formed in 1903 in Bia≈Çystok, were Jews. Yiddish- speaking Jews participated in the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam in 1907. Freie Arbeiter Stimme, vol 1 no 4, Friday, July 25, 1890. Jewish anarchist movements tended to stress the internationalist character of the movement, but many of them also supported their national culture and focused on specifically Jewish issues. Yiddish anarchist literature flourished since the 1880s until the 1950s and, on much smaller scale, until the 1980s; the last Yiddish periodical publication, Problemen was published in 1991. In addition to many original books, pamphlets, poems and essays, all the major works of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, Peter Kropotkin, Errico Malatesta, Henry Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy, Max Stirner and other anarchists were translated into Yiddish. Rudolf Rocker, a non-Jewish German anarchist, had studied Yiddish and authored many Yiddish books, pamphlets and articles. Most Jewish anarchists were anarcho-syndicalists, while a few others were individualist anarchists. Different anarchist groups had different views on Zionism and the Jewish question. Bernard Lazare was a key figure in both the French anarchist movement and early Zionist movement. The later Territorialist movement, especially the Freeland League, under the leadership of Isaac Nachman Steinberg, was very close to anarchism. Some others, such as Martin Buber and Gershom Scholem, advocated non-nationalist forms of Zionism, and promoted the idea of creating a binational Jewish-Arab federation in Palestine. Many contemporary anarchists support the idea of what has been dubbed the \\"no-state solution\\". Noam Chomsky has said that, as an anarchist, he ultimately favors such a no-state solution, but, in the short term, feels a two-state solution is the best way out of the present conflict.Noam Chomsky \\"Advocacy and Realism: A reply to Noah Cohen\\" ZNet, August 26, 2004  Religious Jewish anarchism  Jacques Ellul recounts that at the end of the Book of Judges (Judges 21:25) there was no king in Israel and everyone did as they saw fit.BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: Judges 21:25 Later in the first Book of Samuel (1 Samuel 8) the people of Israel wanted a king to be like other nations.BibleGateway.com - Passage Lookup: 1 Samuel 8 God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to militarism, conscription, and taxation and that their pleas for mercy from the king's demands would go unanswered. Samuel passed on God's warning to the Israelites but they disregarded him and chose Saul as their king. Much of the subsequent Tanakh chronicles them trying to live with this decision. While many Jewish anarchists were irreligious or sometimes vehemently anti-religious, there were also a few religious anarchists and pro- anarchist thinkers, who combined contemporary radical ideas with traditional Judaism. Some secular anti-authoritarians, such as Abba Gordin and Erich Fromm, also noticed remarkable similarity between anarchism and many Kabbalistic ideas, especially in their Hasidic interpretation. Some Jewish mystical groups were based on anti-authoritarian principles, somewhat similar to the Christian Quakers and Dukhobors. Martin Buber, a deeply religious philosopher, had frequently referred to the Hasidic tradition. The Orthodox Kabbalist rabbi Yehuda Ashlag believed in a religious version of libertarian communism, based on principles of Kabbalah, which he called altruist communism. Ashlag supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of self-ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually 'annul the brute-force regime completely, for ‚Äúevery man did that which was right in his own eyes.‚Äù', because 'there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government'. A British Orthodox rabbi, Yankev-Meyer Zalkind, was an anarcho-communist and very active anti- militarist. Rabbi Zalkind, a close friend of Rudolf Rocker, was a prolific Yiddish writer and a prominent Torah scholar. He argued, that the ethics of the Talmud, if properly understood, is closely related to anarchism.  Contemporary Jewish Anarchism  Over the past decade, there has been a renewed interest in Jewish anarchism due to the growth of organizations like Jewdas (UK) and media outlets like the Treyf Podcast (Canada).\\"Treyf Podcast\\" This interest has been aided by the publication of new books on the subject, such as Kenyon Zimmer's Immigrants against the State, and the reissuing of documentaries such as The Free Voice of Labor Pacific Street Films, \\"Free Voice of Labour: The Jewish Anarchists\\", which details the final days of the Fraye Arbeter Shtime. In January 2019, The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research organized a special conference on Yiddish anarchism in New York City, which drew over 450 people. Andrew Silow-Carroll, \\"A YIVO conference finds a new audience for Yiddish anarchism\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency, January 22, 2019  Anarchists in contemporary Israel  There are a number of anarchist groups in Israel. In the past decade, the Israeli group known as \\"Anarchists Against the Wall\\" became widely known in the ongoing struggle around the creation of the variously called Separation Wall/Fence/Barrier on the West Bank. While most of them are Jewish, members of the group do not define themselves as being \\"Jewish anarchists\\".

It was the first railroad bridge connecting Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky. The bridge was originally built between 1886 and 1889 by a predecessor of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. The bridge cost $3,348,675, an enormous sum. By 1929 it was obsolete, and a replacement was built on extended piers immediately adjacent to the original structure. This new bridge was given the same name as the original and is still in use, carrying the CSX Railroad (the C&O;'s successor) across the river.

It is located around to the north of Kilmartin, in Argyll and Bute, western Scotland, at . History The castle was built by reforming churchman John Carswell, who was Rector of Kilmartin, Chancellor of the Chapel Royal at Stirling, and later titular Bishop of the Isles. Carswell published the first book to be printed in Scottish Gaelic, a translation of John Knox's Book of Common Order. Construction began in 1565 using masons brought from Stirling; although notionally built for Carswell's patron, the Earl of Argyll, he intended it as a personal residence for himself. On Carswell's death in 1572, the castle passed to the Earl of Argyll and sold in 1643 to Sir Dugald Campbell, 3rd Baronet of Auchinbreck. His successor Duncan Campbell was one of the few to actively support Argyll's Rising against James VII in 1685. The Atholl Raid that followed the failure of the Rising devastated large parts of Argyllshire; despite recovering his estates in 1689, Duncan Campbell was financially ruined. In 1690, he petitioned Parliament claiming Maclean clansmen burnt Carnasserie Castle, stole 2,000 cattle and murdered his uncle Alexander Campbell of Strondour. Although the outer walls remain largely undamaged, Carnasserie was never rebuilt and the Auchinbrecks eventually went bankrupt. In the 19th century the estate was sold to the Malcolms of Poltalloch, who also own nearby Duntrune Castle. Today the castle and its surroundings are protected as a scheduled monument. The castle is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public. Architecture Carnasserie Castle seen from the south-west, with the hall house in the foreground. Carnasserie has only ever been slightly altered, in the late 17th century, and so presents an accurate picture of 16th-century architecture. Although sited on raised ground close to a strategic pass at the head of Kilmartin Glen, it was designed more for domestic rather than military purposes.Walker, p.76 The castle comprises a 5-storey tower house, with a longer three storey hall house, providing a substantial range of accommodation. At basement level are the remains of cellars and a kitchen with a large fireplace and water inlet. Above this is the large hall. This is connected to a large drawing room in the tower house, which retains its stone floor and large fireplace with finely carved stone decoration. A broad stair rises from the entrance to the hall, contained in a small tower to the north-west. A second smaller stair leads up from the hall to the parapet walk on three sides of the tower house. Upper rooms would have contained bedrooms. The exterior displays numerous \\"double keyhole\\" gunloops, as well as decorative string courses and corbelling. Over the entrance are blank panels framed by carved supports, as well as the arms of the 5th Earl of Argyll with the Gaelic motto DIA LE UA NDUIBHNE, \\"God be with O'Duine\\", referring to the semi-legendary ancestors of Clan Campbell. At the top of the tower are the remains of open rounds along the parapet, and a caphouse above the stair. Fragments of carved drain spouts have been found, and are on display in the cellars. To the south and west is a partially walled courtyard garden. An archway bears the inscription SDC LHL 1681, for Sir Duncan Campbell, 4th Baronet and Lady Henrietta Lindsay, whose support for Argyll's uprising led to the castle's destruction.

The station is licensed to Franklin, New Jersey, is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and has an adult contemporary music format, playing current and recent AC Hits mixed in with mostly big hits of the 1980s and 1990s, with an occasional 70's hit. The station is consistently the number one radio station in Sussex County. It has studios in Franklin, and transmitter in Hardyston Township, New Jersey. It broadcasts the syndicated program Delilah After Dark nightly from 7PM-12AM and archived rebroadcasts of Casey Kasem's American Top 40 on Sunday mornings. The station also plays Christmas music during the Holiday season. History The station began on February 28, 1965, as WLVP, named for Louis VanderPlate, the station's founder. The station's studio, transmitter and Vander Plate's house were atop Hamburg Mountain, overlooking Franklin and Sussex County's central valleys. The station's power was 360 watts, and initially had a country and gospel format.http://www.angelfire.com/nj2/piratejim/njfmhistory8.html In 1971, WLVP was sold for $75,000 to Peter Bardach, an advertising executive who lived in New Jersey and worked on Madison Avenue. Bardach changed the station's call letters to WSUS. (Bardach's company was Sussex County Stereo, even though WSUS itself broadcast a mono signal for several years before actually going stereo.) James Normoyle, a veteran disc jockey who used the name Jay Edwards, was hired as Sales Manager in 1972 and later became General Manager and part owner with Bardach. Normoyle eventually became the full owner. The station had a Top 40/Country hybrid format called \\"Town & Country\\". Half the songs played were current Top 40 Hits and half the songs country, including current hits and older songs. In 1975 WSUS changed its night-time format to Top 40/Rock mixing Top 40 and Rock cuts both old and new. During the day it continued the Top 40/Country hybrid format. In 1973 the station moved its studios from the mountaintop to 75 Main Street in Franklin. The transmitter remained, and the power was eventually raised to the current level of 590 watts. WSUS liners included \\"All Hit Music\\" and \\"Dependable WSUS\\". The station was also news intensive during the day. Its news is known as \\"First Report News\\". WSUS consistently was at or near the top when ratings are measured. Sussex County occasionally was a rated market when WSUS and WNNJ would pay Arbitron to take diaries in Sussex County in order to measure ratings here. This practice only happened once a year until the past 10 years. Now Sussex is rated for Spring and Summer Books. This is known as \\"Buying the Book\\". In such a practice local stations in an area pay in order to get rated for their home county. This practice is increasingly becoming common in rural areas in order to sell ads. In the winter of 1982 with Top 40 leaning young again and WIXL doing very well with its all-country format, WSUS dropped the daytime Top 40/Country hybrid format during the day and the Top 40/Rock format at night and became an adult contemporary radio station. It was more of a Hot AC at night (playing slightly more rock then) but overall it was now AC rather than Top 40. The station became a slightly hotter AC by the late 1980s. The station continued with weekend specialty shows as well. In 1991, WSUS gradually moved into a regular straight ahead adult contemporary format. In 1997 Jay Edwards sold WSUS to Nassau Broadcasting Partners, and channeled his earnings into a brief career in harness racing. He died in 2002. Early in 1998 Nassau took over the station and revamped the format. The station now became known as \\"The Best Variety of Soft Rock\\". It added Delilah, a syndicated love songs show in the 7 p.m.-to- midnight time slot. The station also added better sounding jingles as well. By now the market was rated twice a year. In all but a few books WSUS has easily been the number one station in the area. Occasionally now co-owned Classic Rock station WNNJ was on top. In the Winter of 2001 Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) purchased all the Nassau stations in the Sussex/Warren/Monroe County cluster except for WVPO, WSBG, and AM 960 located in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Clear Channel would get WSUS, WHCY, WNNJ (AM) (now WTOC (AM)), WNNJ (FM), and local marketing agreements for WDLC and WTSX (which would end Fall of 2004). WSUS stayed as it was with no changes. In fact WSUS is the only station that has not since been changed significantly since the sale to Clear Channel. In exchange for these stations Nassau was paid a good sum of cash plus WEEX and WODE-FM in the Lehigh Valley (which Clear Channel had to sell due to the merger with AM/FM/Chancellor).http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/10851/#axzz2aLje4ykn WSUS continues to be a high rated station in the region. It concentrates on news, traffic, and weather. Clear Channel has consolidated the studios of the Sussex and Warren County stations at 45 Ed Mitchell Avenue in Franklin.

There is little theatrical or staged musical tradition, and the facilities have not yet fully recovered from the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. Yet, the area has some interesting things to offer musically. General comments Basilicata gave the birth to Obadiah the Proselyte, a nobleman cited as the first composer who transcribed notations of synagogal chant, which are the oldest discovered to date.Obadiah, the Norman Proselyte The most famous classical composers from Basilicata are Carlo Gesualdo, considered one of the greatest madrigalists of the Renaissance era, and Egidio Duni, who gained international notoriety, mainly in France. Basilicata's international musical heritage includes a large group of itinerant musicians who, beginning in the early 1860s, immigrated across the world, in Paris, New York, London and Ottawa. Many of these musicians continued performing and brought their folk traditions with them.Canadian Journal of Traditional Music Famous itinerant musicians, mostly harpists, flautists and violinists, were originally from Viggiano, province of Potenza, who reached important positions in the worldwide music scene, especially in the United States. The most important musician of the era was probably Leonardo De Lorenzo, flautist of many international orchestras and music educator at the Eastman School of Music. Another prominent musician Carlo Curti, popularized the mandolin in American music and created one of Mexico's oldest orchestras, the Mexican Typical Orchestra, which is considered the \\"predecessor of the Mariachi bands.\\" Modern musicians from the region include pop singers Mango and Arisa and mezzo-soprano Anna Bonitatibus. Musical venues and activities Matera is one of the most interesting sites in the world in terms of urban archaeology, the area is the site of the Sassi cave dwellings, a mountainside of dwellings originally dug out as caves. The city is in the midst of making the area more hospitable to tourists and injecting cultural and musical activity. The newer, modern city of Matera (away from the caves) hosts the Teatro Egidio Romualdo Duni, the site of regular concert season put on by the Matera Provincial Orchestra. The city also has the Duni music conservatory. The Francesco Stabile theater is the main opera house in the Potenza area and was opened in 1881 with a presentation of Traviata. The theater was built to be a smaller replica of Naples' San Carlo opera house. It was damaged by the quake of 1980, but was rebuilt and reopened in 1990. It has a regular season of opera as well as classical music concerts. The city is also the cite of the Gesualdo da Venosa music conservatory, which boast a modern 500-seat auditorium. The Stabile Association sponsors an annual summer music festival called Festainmusica. References *Guide Cultura, i luoghi della music (2003) ed. Touring Club Italiano.

It is the first part of a two-part story. The second part, \\"The Satan Pit\\", was broadcast on 10 June. The episode is set on Krop Tor, a planet orbiting a black hole. In the episode, a human expedition group drilling on the planet is terrorised by a creature calling itself the Beast (Gabriel Woolf), which possesses the Ood slaves in the humans' base. Plot The TARDIS arrives aboard a sanctuary base used for deep-space expeditions. The Tenth Doctor and Rose explore the area, discovering strange alien writing that the TARDIS is unable to translate, meaning that it is \\"impossibly old\\". They are confronted by the Ood, a docile race of empathic slaves who work on the station. After a misunderstanding with the Ood, the Doctor and Rose meet the crew of the base, Zach, Ida, Jefferson, Danny, Scooti and Toby. The crew are on an expedition on the mysterious planet Krop Tor, impossibly in orbit around a black hole. Captain Zach explains that a gravity funnel exists around the planet, allowing them to safely enter or leave the vicinity of the black hole. The source of the funnel is an immense energy force ten miles within the planet, which they are drilling towards to understand its power. As the Doctor and Rose are acquainting themselves with the crew, the base is struck by a quake that causes the section of the base containing the TARDIS to fall into the planet. Rose and the Doctor resign themselves to being trapped and begin helping out the crew. As the drill nears its target, a malevolent presence begins to make itself known. The Ood's translation spheres reveal messages about the Beast awakening, while Toby is unknowingly possessed by the Beast. The possessed Toby kills Scooti when she discovers him surviving outside the base without any protective gear. When the drilling is complete, the Doctor offers to go with Ida into the bowels of the planet. After travelling down the drill shaft, the Doctor and Ida find a large circular disk inscribed with more undecipherable markings. The Doctor believes it to be a door, and they watch as it opens. Suddenly, the Beast repossesses Toby before transferring into all the Ood as they refer to themselves as the Legion of the Beast. With Rose and the remaining crew alerted that the planet is now falling towards the black hole, the Ood begin to close in on them whilst the voice of the Beast declares that it is free. Production Writer Matt Jones also wrote, as Matthew Jones, the Virgin New Adventures novel Bad Therapy, featuring the Seventh Doctor and Chris Cwej. He was script editor on Russell T Davies' Channel 4 series Queer as Folk. The Ood as they appear in the Doctor Who Experience. Executive producer and chief writer Russell T Davies said that an early draft of the script called for the role of the Ood to be filled by Raxacoricofallapatorians, the same species as the Slitheen. Their race would have been enslaved and they wished to awaken the Beast, whom they believed to be a god that could free them. Davies chose the name of the Ood rather than Jones; he intended it to be a play on the word \\"odd\\". In the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential episode, Davies said that he likes to think that the Ood come from a planet near to that of the Sensorites from the First Doctor serial The Sensorites (1964), as he suggests the races are similar in some respects. In \\"Planet of the Ood\\", this is confirmed. During an interview with the production crew, it was noted that the sanctuary base was based on the spaceship Nostromo from the movie Alien. Scenes of bodies floating in space were filmed on the underwater stage at Pinewood Studios, the first time the series has used this facility, not counting the charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death. This is the first episode of the 2005 revival of Doctor Who to use a quarry as an alien planet ‚Äî quarries were frequently used in this manner in the original series. Davies was not a fan of this production decision. The Ood masks had their eyes in non-human positions, so the actors who played them had to see out of pin prick sized holes in the masks. Cast notes The voice of the Beast is provided by Gabriel Woolf, who also played Sutekh the Destroyer in the Fourth Doctor serial Pyramids of Mars (1975). One of the names that the possessed Ood have for the Beast is Satan. The Fourth Doctor also stated that Sutekh has been known by many aliases, including the Typhonian beast and Satan. However, Woolf was cast only after the episode had been written and filmed. Originally, the producers sought out Piper's husband Chris Evans for the role. Danny Webb also appeared in the audio plays The Girl Who Never Was and The Dark Husband. Shaun Parkes previously starred with David Tennant in the BBC's 2005 Casanova serial written by Russell T Davies. Silas Carson previously played various alien voices in \\"The End of the World\\", while Paul Kasey is a veteran at playing various monsters for Doctor Who and Torchwood. Broadcast and reception Overnight viewing figures for the episode were 5.94 million, peaking at 6.78 million. However, the episode still obtained a 39.8% share of the audience and was the second highest rated programme of the evening, behind Casualty. The final ratings for the episode were 6.32 million viewers. This episode and \\"The Satan Pit\\" were released in the UK, together with \\"Love & Monsters\\", as a basic DVD with no special features on 7 August 2006. IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a score of 9.3 out of 10, describing it as \\"an extremely well written and directed episode with awesome visuals and excellent sound design\\". Though he noted that \\"much of this episode felt a bit like watching a moderately entertaining B-movie like Event Horizon\\", he thought it was \\"presented with ample flair and charm\\". Dek Hogan of Digital Spy stated the episode got the series \\"back on form\\", though he noted that losing the TARDIS was becoming tiresome. Dave Golder, writing for SFX, felt that the two-parter abandoned Doctor Who \\"manic energy, a level of wit and an idiosyncratic visual approach\\" for more traditional science fiction, which made it look at times like \\"Stargate lite\\". While he thought the spaceship looked \\"silly\\", he praised the support cast and especially Tennant and Piper. Of \\"The Impossible Planet\\" he stated, \\"The build-up of the mystery was superbly paced and intriguing. The characters were fleshed out with masterful economy. The tension was tangible. The villain felt dangerous. And in the idea of an evil entity taking control of a telepathically linked race we had the kind of good, solid SF idea ‚Äì simple and technobabble-free enough for the non-SF literate audience to grasp ‚Äì in which the new series should be trading. It helps that the Ood were such a great piece of design work, as well.\\" In popular culture In a September 2013 National Geographic Daily News article, the author mentioned this episode while discussing planets that surround black holes.

One of Henderson's most important songs, it presents a non-romantic view of the role of the Scots in the world at the time it was written. It describes a wind of change blowing through Scotland and the world, sweeping away exploitation and imperialism. It renounces the tradition of the Scottish soldier both as imperial cannon-fodder and colonial oppressor, mourning the loss of youth sent to harry foreign nations, and looks to a future society which is multiracial and just. History An early two-stanza version of the song was published in a broadsheet \\"Writers against Aparthied\\" (sic) in the Spring of 1960; as the first line refers to Harold Macmillan's Wind of Change speech, given in February of that year, the composition can be dated quite precisely. Henderson was recorded singing the complete 3-stanza version of the song that year. The song's tune is an adaptation of the First World War pipe march \\"The Bloody Fields of Flanders\\", composed by John McLellan DCM (Dunoon), which Henderson first heard played on the Anzio beachhead. He wrote the lyrics after discussions with Ken Goldstein, an American researcher at the School of Scottish Studies, who had enjoyed Henderson's rendition of the tune. It was subsequently adopted by Glasgow Peace Marcher CND demonstrators and the anti- Polaris campaign (for example, notably at the anti-Polaris protests at Holy Loch in 1961). A product of the Scottish folk revival, and originally a 1960s protest song, it is still popular in Scotland and overseas, especially as an anthem of Scottish Socialists. Henderson described the song as \\"expressing my hopes for Scotland, and for the survival of humanity on this beleaguered planet.\\". It has been suggested as choice for a Scottish national anthem (although there is no official Scottish anthem), though Henderson felt that part of its strength lies in the fact that it is an alternative, \\"International Anthem\\". A version of the song was performed by South African soprano Pumeza Matshikiza at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

The North Wales Society of Architects' Presidential Chain of Office was designed in 1954 by Fattorini and Sons of hallmarked sterling silver finished in polished hard gold plate and vitreous enamelled in three colours.  Manningham Rugby Club and Bradford City Football Club  The family became heavily involved with Manningham Rugby Club in Bradford. Indeed, Tony Fattorini represented Manningham when the club became part of the breakaway from Rugby Union in 1895 which resulted in the birth of what we know today as the Rugby league. Manningham were the new game's first champions in 1896. After a period of decline Manningham changed games and became the football club Bradford City in 1903. Once again the Fattorinis were at the forefront of the switch to football, they also designed and made the FA cup which Bradford City won in 1911. Today Fattorini & Sons was sold to Thomas Fattorini Ltd in 1984. Thomas Fattorini Ltd and Fattorini & Sons were friendly rivals for many years, both businesses being owned and managed by descendants of Antonio Fattorini. Thomas Fattorini Ltd is still trading, and is located in the Birmingham Jewellery quarter, where it is managed by the 6th generation of the Fattorini family. The Harrogate jewellery shop is owned and run by the Tindalls, descendants via the female line.

The bridge is composed of four through truss spans: a main span on the northern side of the bridge, a currently unused swing span on the southern side, and two additional spans over the main shipping channels in the center of the bridge. The bridge crosses the Ohio River just downstream from downtown Cincinnati, and can be seen clearly from the lower level of the nearby Brent Spence Bridge. History The Cincinnati Southern Railway Bridge was begun in 1875; construction was completed in December, 1877, and the bridge immediately opened to traffic. Its cost exclusive of right of way was $811,683. The truss bridge was the longest bridge of its type when it was completed. It was extensively modernized in 1922, and it remains the busiest railroad bridge in the city of Cincinnati today. Since 1976, the bridge's swing span has been abandoned in its closed position, forcing all ships to pass under the center truss spans. For extensively tall ships, the bridge marks the end of their Ohio River voyage.

However, they find the apartment is not empty as expected, and a fierce firefight ensues. The building superintendent and the two drug dealers are killed. Paulie and Cary find a huge amount of money. Tension surges within the DiMeo family. Silvio makes rulings on how the Colombian score, and how Eugene's former Roseville, New Jersey bookmaking revenue, should be split. None of the parties involved like his decisions. A reluctant boss, Silvio is later laid low by an asthma attack, and is himself hospitalised. Paulie and Vito delay paying the $200,000 cut they owe to Carmela, since they do not want to part with it in case Tony does not recover. Vito quietly starts a campaign to position himself as a potential new leader, pointing to his recent weight loss as a sign of better health, and maintaining a cordial relationship with the Lupertazzi acting boss Phil Leotardo, who is a second cousin of Vito's wife Marie. He also happens to be in the hospital when Meadow's fianc√© Finn turns up, and makes a threatening pass at him. Christopher and Bobby confront A.J. who has tried to buy a gun, and tell him not to go after Junior, who is in custody. They assure him that Tony would not want him involved. Carmela sees a TV special about the shooting, in which A.J. says it is weird growing up a Soprano. She is livid, and tells her son she wants to kill him. She sobs in her room. The next day, she has a session with Dr. Melfi. She says she knew what Tony was when she married him, \\"but the kids, they don't decide who they're born to.\\" Chris' passion about entering the movie industry is reborn. He has Benny Fazio and Murmur rough up screenwriter J.T. Dolan, and orders him to write a script for a slasher mob film he wants to produce. Chris later arranges a meeting with potential investors for the production, their chief adviser and partner being Little Carmine. J.T. comes up with the title, Cleaver, and explains the premise, but the investors, who include Silvio, Vito and Larry Boy Barese, seem confused about its plot. Nevertheless, Chris assures them the film is a guaranteed success. Although only family are allowed to see Tony, Silvio and Paulie are smuggled in by Carmela and Meadow. Left alone with Tony, Paulie proceeds to treat his unconscious boss to a tedious and discontented monologue about his current life. Tony's heart-rate escalates steadily, but Paulie does not notice it until he goes into cardiac arrest. Hospital staff rush in. Tony's dream sequence from the previous episode has continued. At his hotel room, he receives a court summons from the Buddhist monks addressed to Kevin Finnerty, and he begins to question his identity. He seeks answers from the bartender and the monks, but finds none. He is disturbed by muffled sounds from an adjoining room at his hotel (Paulie is talking to him), and he bangs angrily on the wall for quiet. Having found a flier for the Finnerty family reunion in his briefcase, he is greeted outside the venue by a man who looks like his cousin Tony Blundetto. The man tries to get Tony to enter the light- festooned house, assuring him that \\"everyone's here\\" and that he is \\"coming home\\"; but he also tells Tony that he must first let go of his \\"business\\" and hand over his briefcase. Tony replies that he has already given away a briefcase once which had \\"his whole life inside\\" and does not want to do it again. Standing at the steps of the house, Tony hesitates for some time. With the figure of someone similar to his mother standing by the doorway in front of him, and the faint voice of a little girl coming from the trees behind him pleading with him not to go (in the hospital Meadow is calling to her father), Tony chooses not to enter the house. He awakes in the hospital. His first words to Carmela are, \\"I'm dead, right?\\" Later, heavily sedated and still largely unable to talk, Tony sits in a chair at the foot of his bed and listens to an excited Christopher explain his movie venture to him; he says he left a position for Tony to become a major investor. Christopher then notices an Ojibwe saying taped onto the wall: \\"Sometimes I go about in pity for myself, and all the while, a great wind carries me across the sky.\\" With Tony now conscious, Paulie and Vito anxiously rush to get their cuts to Carmela. In the hospital lobby, when they hand over the cash, Carmela is initially grateful. However, before the elevator doors close, she turns round and sees them looking sour.

Brown. Their purpose was to create an organisation to draw attention to the effects of high birth rates and rapid population growth on maternal and infant mortality, communities and the environment, and to raise funds for population projects and programmes, with the ultimate aim of reducing world poverty and improving the quality of life of the world‚Äôs poorest people. From 1987 until 1994, WPF was a small organisation mainly supported by donations from the founders and by consultancy assignments. In 1994, the WPF played an important role in the Dutch delegation of the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, Egypt. At this conference, the Cairo Programme of Action was adopted which still serves as a foundation for WPF‚Äôs work. WPF works to reduce maternal and infant mortality, and improve sexual health and reproductive rights. It acknowledges that attention for these themes and to the improvement of services will contribute to the struggle against poverty worldwide. Therefore, WPF advocates the implementation of these themes in the UN's Millennium Development Goals. 2006-2009, the World Population Foundation's board members include Nafis Sadik, former Executive Director of UNFPA. As of 1 January 2011, Rutgers Nisso Groep and World Population Foundation (WPF) have merged under the new name Rutgers WPF. Chair of Rutgers WPF is Bert Koenders, former minister for Development Cooperation of the Netherlands.  In developing countries  WPF mainly supports local organisations that provide young and underprivileged people with access to information and services concerning sexuality and reproduction. WPF works to strengthen the capacity of local organisations, assists in developing and implementing activities, and provides management training. WPF‚Äôs approach is based on Dutch policies on sexual and reproductive health, especially with regard to young people. As of 2006, WPF supported NGOs in nine countries. Currently WPF maintains field offices in Pakistan, Vietnam and Indonesia (Rutgers WPF Indonesia).  Advocacy activities  WPF engages in advocacy with policy makers in the Netherlands, Europe, and, at the international level, with the United Nations. Indirect advocacy includes public awareness creation through the Dutch media and with partner organizations in developing countries. WPF is an active member of Share-Net and EuroNGOs. In 2004 WPF was granted 'Special Consultative Status' by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. WPF established a youth organization: CHOICE for youth and sexuality. CHOICE went on to initiate the Youth Coalition) and YouAct, a European youth networkon sexual and reproductive health and rights. In the Netherlands WPF is campaigning under the MYBODY label, with the slogan My Life, My Choice, MYBODY.

Distribution Osh√° is strictly a mountain plant, and it is most commonly found in deep, moist soils rich in organic material. The plant requires partial shade. Osh√° is widely distributed in the Rocky Mountains and the high mountains of northwestern Mexico. It is most common in the upper limits of the subalpine zone, so in the southern part of its range, it grows at elevations from 7,000 feet to 10,000 feet (2100 m to 3000 m), while in Utah and Wyoming, it grows as low as 5,000 feet (1500 m). Osh√° is dependent on mycorrhizal fungi, and attempts to artificially cultivate the plant outside of its habitat have not been successful. Cultivation in areas where osh√° naturally grows have been more successful.Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, Identification right Osh√° has the typical appearance of members of the carrot family (apiaceae), with parsley-like leaves and double umbels of white flowers. The bases of the leaves where they attach to the root crowns have a reddish tint which is unique, and the roots are fibrous, with a dark, chocolate-brown, wrinkled outer skin. When this skin is removed, the inner root tissue is fibrous and yellowish-white with an overpowering, pleasant \\"spicy celery\\" fragrance that resembles lovage (Levisticum officinale). Osh√° roots have a collar of dead leaf material surrounding the root crowns which is hairlike in appearance. The roots dry very quickly and are very astringent when fresh, and can cause blistering of the mouth and mucous membranes in humans if ingested fresh. The dried roots do not have this astringent effect. Roots of older plants are far stronger and bitter than those of younger plants. Osh√° plants form large clumps over time, and can grow to be very large. In areas of New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, osh√° can reach heights of 6 to 7 feet and produce circular colonies with dozens of root crowns growing from a central root mass. Osh√° is best harvested in the afternoon as the plants are relished by bears, which are known to visit the plants during the morning. Similar species Osh√° grows in the same habitat in areas of the Mountain West of North America with poison hemlock and water hemlock, highly poisonous members of the same family. Osh√° particularly resembles poison hemlock, but is easily distinguished from it by its \\"spicy celery\\" odor, hair-like material on root crowns, and dark chocolate-brown, wrinkled root skin. Hemlock roots are white and fleshy and thin-skinned; they are typically heavily branched rather than carrot-like, but this is not always the case. Poison hemlock roots have little or no odor; the plants themselves smell \\"musty\\" or \\"mousy\\" or rank. Osh√° leaves have an intense fragrance when bruised and are typically larger than those of poison hemlock. Most poison hemlock plants have purple blotches or shading on the lower stem if they are fairly mature, but again, this is not always the case. Unlike its poisonous cousins, osh√° does not tolerate overly moist soils (because it depends on mycorrhizal fungi) and is never found growing in standing water. Nevertheless, osh√° and poison hemlock can be found only a few feet from each other. If the plant is growing near water in consistently moist soil, is tall (0.75‚Äì2m), has purple splotches on the main stem, and is heavily branched with small umbels of white flowers, it is probably poison hemlock and should be avoided. In any case, due to the high toxicity of poison hemlock, if a supposed osh√° plant cannot be positively identified, it must be discarded. Coniine, the main poison in hemlock species, can be absorbed through the skin. People who have come into contact with these plants, including crushing the leaves to perform a \\"smell test,\\" should wash their hands immediately and avoid touching their eyes or mouth. Cow parsnip (Heracleum lanatum, Heracleum maximum, Indian celery, or pushki, sometimes considered a subspecies of Heracleum sphondylium, hogweed or eltrot) is also confused with osh√° and other plants with similar flower groupings. However, cow parsnip has large, broad leaves and an unpleasant odor. SSK Cultural associations In many Native American cultures, osh√° is called \\"bear root\\" or \\"bear medicine.\\" According to the ethnobotanist Shawn Sigstedt, who lived and studied with the Din√©, a story is told of the brown bear's affinity for the osh√° roots. The bear would eat the roots and rub some of them over its fur. The Din√© credit the bear with leading them to powerful medicine.Cowen, Ron. 1990. \\"Medicine on the wild side; animals may rely on a natural pharmacy\\".

It tells the story of Tal, a boy who lives in a world with eternal darkness. His home is a Castle with seven towers. The cover design and art are by Madalina Stefan and Steve Rawlings respectively.  Prologue  Tal, a young Chosen boy, is climbing the Red Tower with his shadowguard to steal a Sunstone. He reaches just below the Veil when he hears a cry far below. For a moment, Tal thinks he has been caught, only to realize the scream was from his little brother, who has secretly followed him. It was he that was caught by a Spiritshadow. Tal decides it would be too risky to climb back down to help his little brother, so he proceeds to climb the Veil. He arrives above the Veil only to meet a Spiritshadow without a master, calling itself the 'Keeper'. After briefly fighting with it, it eventually sends Tal falling off the Red Tower.  Before  Tal has just found out that his father is missing, presumably dead. Unfortunately, his father is the only one in his family possessing a Primary Sunstone. Tal's Mother possessed a primary sunstone, but upon becoming ill, its power faded along with her. Without it, Tal's family will not be able to enter the spirit world of Aenir. This is troubling for the family in two ways; first, Tal, who has reached the proper age, would not be able to bind himself a Spiritshadow, and would thus be doomed as an Underfolk, a servant of the Castle; secondly, his mother is very ill, and Tal believes the cure may be found in Aenir. He knows that he must find a Sunstone, and tries to obtain one in three different ways. The first way is asking one from his cruel aunts. Upon asking, Tal meets Shadowmaster Sushin, who, like his aunts, wish to make his and his family's life more miserable than it is. This puzzles Tal, since Sushin is a stranger to him. His aunts refuse to give one of their multiple Sunstones, so Tal has to depend on his next plan, which is by winning a Chosen competition among the Achievements of Luminosity. He enters the Achievement of Body category, but finds out at the last minute that somehow he had been \\"registered\\" for the wrong category. His name was written on the Achievement of Music roster. Without a piece to play, he runs down to find his great-uncle Ebbitt, who gives him a piece to perform. Upon entering the contest, he finds, much to his horror, that Sushin is one of the three judges. He performs the piece quite well, but is given the Yellow Ray of Failed Ambition, meaning he tried too hard. He does not win a Sunstone. The third way is by asking one from the Empress of the castle. The guards of the Empress makes a deal with his, asking him to play a game called 'Beastmaker'. If Tal wins, he may enter. If Tal loses, he will give up his Sunstone. They play the game, and just as it appears that Tal will win, Sharrakor, who he knows as the Empress's Spiritshadow, viciously stops the game. The frightened guards force him to leave. With no way to get a Sunstone, he goes to his great-uncle again. Ebbitt advises him to steal a Sunstone by climbing the Red Tower, the least guarded tower of the seven that protrude from the Castle.

It is a metabolic by-product of continual protein modification processes in the cytoplasm of all human cells. It is closely related to L-arginine, a conditionally essential amino acid. ADMA interferes with L-arginine in the production of nitric oxide (NO), a key chemical involved in normal endothelial function and, by extension, cardiovascular health. Discovery Patrick Vallance and his London co-workers first noted the interference role for asymmetric dimethylarginine in the early 1990s. Today biochemical and clinical research continues into the role of ADMA in cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction and certain forms of kidney disease. Synthesis and regulation in the body Cardiovascular effects have been linked to ADMA Asymmetric dimethylarginine is created in protein methylation, a common mechanism of post-translational protein modification. This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme set called S-adenosylmethionine protein N-methyltransferases (protein methylases I and II). The methyl groups transferred to create ADMA are derived from the methyl group donor S-adenosylmethionine, an intermediate in the metabolism of homocysteine. (Homocysteine is an important blood chemical because it is also a marker of cardiovascular disease). After synthesis, ADMA migrates into the extracellular space and thence into blood plasma. Asymmetric dimethylarginine is measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. ADMA concentrations are substantially elevated by native or oxidized LDL cholesterol. Thus a spiralling effect occurs with high endothelial LDL levels causing greater ADMA values, which in turn inhibit NO production needed to promote vasodilation. The elimination of ADMA occurs through urine excretion and metabolism by the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). The role of homocysteine as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease is suggested to be mediated by homocysteine down-regulating production of DDAH in the body. Polyphenol antioxidants also play a role in down-regulating homocysteine. ADMA and suggested lines of therapeutic research ADMA may play a role in certain forms of kidney disease With raised levels of ADMA seemingly to be associated with adverse human health consequences for cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, and also a wide range of diseases of the elderly, the possible lowering of ADMA levels may have important therapeutic effects. However, it has yet to be established whether ADMA levels can be manipulated and, more important, if this results in useful clinical benefits. The association of ADMA with abnormalities of lipid regulation suggested that supplements of free fatty acids might manipulate ADMA levels. However, research has failed to show that these have an effect. ADMA's role has been linked with elevated levels of homocysteine. Whilst approaches at modifying the latter with oral supplements of folic acid were strongly suggested, studies have shown this fails to give any clinical benefit and suggested that B vitamins might instead increase some cardiovascular risks. Direct alteration of ADMA levels with supplements of L-arginine have been suggested. The hope is that such intervention might not only improve endothelial function but also reduce clinical symptoms of overt cardiovascular disease. However studies show inconsistency in results in a clinical context, and the recent results with manipulating homocysteine levels warrant extreme care with what clinical outcomes might arise from this approach. Statins, as well as affecting circulating cholesterol levels, also increase nitric oxide levels and so have a direct effect on blood supply to the heart. Elevated levels of ADMA seems to modify this effect and so may have consequences for patients' responsiveness to taking statins. Repeated administration of d-amphetamine may decrease ADMA.

It is on the county boundary with Buckinghamshire, almost west of Buckingham and just over east of Brackley in Northamptonshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 466. Archaeology In 2000 archaeologists found evidence of Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman activity in Finmere Quarry about west of the village. Five early Bronze Age cremation pits were excavated, and from one pit two collared urns were recovered. The cremations were dated to about 2040 to 1880 BC. The site of a late Iron Age settlement was found west of the cremation pits and just east of the trackbed of the former Great Central Main Line railway. The settlement consisted originally of a number of roundhouses packed close together in a straight line, and then developed in phases with later structures overlapping the sites of some of the earlier ones. Enclosures, presumably to contain livestock, were created at different times and in different shapes, with the outlines of some enclosures from different periods overlapping the sites of the roundhouses and each other. Iron Age pottery recovered from the site suggests that the settlement was occupied in phases from the 4th to the 1st century BC. A pair of ditches were found running parallel across the site about apart and roughly east‚Äìwest. The ditches were identified as flanking a track, and fragments of wheel-thrown pottery found on part of the site led to the track being dated to the period of Roman occupation of Britain. The site is about from the course of the Roman road that linked Alchester near Bicester with Lactodurum (now Towcester), which runs through the eastern side of Finmere village. Manor Finmere's toponym is derived from the Old English for \\"pool frequented by woodpeckers\\". The village includes the hamlet of Little Tingewick. Before and after the Norman Conquest of England Wulfward the White, a thegn of King Edward the Confessor's Queen Edith, owned the Manor of Finmere. However, by 1086 William of Normandy had granted the manor to Geoffrey de Montbray, who was Bishop of Coutances but also one of William's senior military commanders. Subsequently, the manor passed to the Earls of Gloucester, in whose family it stayed until the 4th Earl of Gloucester died without a successor in 1314. In 1347 the manor passed to the 1st Earl of Stafford, in whose family it then remained. Parish church Finmere had a parish church by 1189, when its advowson was granted to the Augustinian Friary in Bristol. The only surviving remnant from the parish church of that period seems to be the 12th century font. The earliest surviving parts of the present Church of England parish church of St Michael and All Angels are the tower, the north wall of the chancel and the Decorated Gothic windows in the chancel and the south wall of the nave. The Perpendicular Gothic clerestory was added later. The church underwent major repairs at various times in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. A west gallery was added, probably in the 1760s. In 1856‚Äì58 the Gothic Revival architect G.E. Street removed the west gallery, restored the church, widened the chancel arch and added the north aisle. A vestry was added in 1868 and a porch in 1876. The architectural historians Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and Jennifer Sherwood criticised Street's alterations for being \\"too aggressive\\" and dominating the rest of the building. St. Michael's bell tower has three bells. William Chamberlain of Aldgate cast the tenor in about 1470 and an unidentified bellfounder cast the treble in about 1599. The middle bell is of unknown age but Lester and Pack of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast it in 1754. The tower has also an historic turret clock that was installed in 1697. 22 donors between them raised the ¬£8 10s 0d cost. The clock was altered with a new escapement and other alterations in 1858 and reinstalled in 1859. Dr James Clarke of Finmere House designed the escapement and paid the ¬£10 cost of reinstallation, which was done by William Bayliss, the village carpenter. The Church of England parish is now a member of the Benefice of Shelswell, which includes the parishes of Cottisford, Fringford, Godington, Hardwick-cum- Tusmore, Hethe, Mixbury, Newton Purcell, Stoke Lyne and Stratton Audley. Social and economic history The Domesday book records that by 1086 the village had a watermill. The village continued to have a mill on the Great Ouse until early in the 19th century, when Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos had it demolished. In 1645 during the English Civil War a Parliamentarian force from Newport Pagnell surprised a platoon of eighteen Royalists stationed in Finmere. The Parliamentarians drove the Royalists out of the village, which thereafter remained under Parliamentarian control. An open field system of farming predominated in the parish until 1667, when the common fields were enclosed. In 1824 the 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos built a National School for the village. In 1926 it was reorganised as a junior school, with senior pupils thereafter going to the school in Fringford. The first Finmere school was closed in 1948. A new school was built and opened in 1959. Historic houses Finmere rectory has had a chequered history. In 1634 it was a relatively small house of only four bays. Thereafter it was enlarged to ten bays, but in 1662 a violent storm blew it down. The rector had it rebuilt as a house of only five bays, but that burnt down in 1668. By 1685 the rectory consisted of only three bays, but by 1738 it had been enlarged to six. Also in the 18th century \\"Capability\\" Brown designed its gardens. No trace of Brown's work survives, and in 1867 the house was demolished and replaced with a new rectory. This is now a private house, Finmere Place. Other historic houses in Finmere include Finmere House (built in 1600 and re-fronted in 1739) and Lepper's House (built in 1638 and rebuilt in 1879). Transport Finmere was on the main road between Buckingham and Banbury, which was made into a turnpike by an Act of Parliament in 1744. Since the 1920s the road has been classified as the A421, and later in the 20th century a bypass was built past the former RAF Finmere airfield, south of Finmere and the neighbouring Buckinghamshire village of Tingewick, to take the A421 past the two villages. In 1847‚Äì50 the Buckinghamshire Railway built a branch line to through the northern part of the parish along the Great Ouse Valley. station was built on the line about northwest of the village. In 1899 the Great Central Railway built its main line to London through the western part of the parish and built Finmere for Buckingham station about south of the village. Buckingham already had a railway station on the Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line and was almost from the Great Central station, so the name was subsequently shortened to the more appropriate \\"Finmere\\". British Railways closed Finmere station in 1963, and closed the section of the Great Central line through the station in 1966. BR also closed Fulwell and Westbury station and the branch line to Banbury in the 1960s. RAF Finmere The War Department built a military airfield south of Finmere and Tingewick in 1941‚Äì42, which was commissioned in July 1942 as RAF Finmere. It served as a Bomber Command operational training unit, flying Bristol Blenheim medium bombers which by then were obsolete for combat operations and used only for training. They were eventually withdrawn from this role as well and from January 1944 the training unit at RAF Finmere flew de Havilland Mosquitoes. After the Second World War RAF Finmere served as a Transport Command storage depot until the 1950s, when it was decommissioned and closed as an RAF base. Part of one runway remains in use as a private airfield. Since 1973 a Sunday market has been held on the area where the three concrete runways converge. Initially Buckinghamshire County Council opposed the market and had the operators convicted and fined for breaking the Shops Act 1950 that forbade most forms of retailing in England and Wales on Sundays. In 1974 Britain's local government reorganisation transferred responsibility for planning to Aylesbury Vale District Council, which in 1975 granted the market planning permission for three years and in 1976 extended that permission until 1981. In 1994 Parliament adopted the Sunday Trading Act which greatly reduced restrictions on Sunday retailing in England and Wales, and since then Finmere Market has been less busy. However, the former airfield is now also the venue of the annual Bicester Sheep Fair. On 2 April 1992 a US Air Force plane crashed near Finmere. There were no fatalities or casualties. It was speculated that the plane was attempting to make an emergency landing at the disused airfield at Finmere. Amenities The parish has a thatched 17th- or 18th-century public house, the Red Lion at Little Tingewick. It is now a gastropub.The Red Lion Little Tingewick There is a village hall and playing fields at the north end of Finmere village.

History The company was founded in 1995 by John and Carol Stewart. Originally a purebred Black Angus farm in Campbellsburg, Kentucky, Creekstone Farms entered the processing business in 2003 with the purchase of a processing plant in Arkansas City, Kansas. The company began processing Creekstone Farms Premium Black Angus cattle in May 2003. In the spring of 2004, Creekstone Farms launched an additional line of Black Angus products - Creekstone Farms Natural Black Angus Beef. John Stewart retired from the company in October 2007. Creekstone Farms is currently owned by the Marubeni Corporation and was owned by Sun Capital Partners. When Mr. Stewart retired, he retained ownership of the farm in Kentucky, which has since been sold and no longer is connected to the Creekstone Farms brand. The company reports that Japan's ban on U.S. beef beginning in 2003 caused the company to lose a third of its sales, prompting the layoff of about 150 people. BSE testing Creekstone Farms is known for its attempt to test all of its beef for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \\"mad cow disease\\"). At a cost of about half a million dollars, Creekstone built a testing lab, the first inside a U. S. meat packing plant, and hired the necessary personnel. In 2004, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which controls the sale of testing kits, refused to sell Creekstone enough to test all of its cows. The USDA's stated position was that allowing any meatpacking company to test every cow would undermine the agency's official position that random testing was scientifically adequate to assure safety. The USDA also claims that testing does not ensure food safety because the disease is difficult to detect in younger animals. An alternative position is that the USDA's objection is the result of pressure from larger meatpacking operations. The president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association told the Washington Post that \\"If testing is allowed at Creekstone, we think it would become the international standard and the domestic standard, too.\\"Marc Kaufman, \\"Company's Mad Cow Tests Blocked; USDA Fears Other Firms' Meat Would Appear Unsafe,\\" The Washington Post, April 16, 2004, AO1. Creekstone Farms says tests cost about $20 per animal, increasing the cost of beef by about 10 cents per pound. The USDA currently tests about 1 percent of cattle slaughtered in the U.S. Lawsuit In March 2006, Creekstone filed a lawsuit against the USDA for refusing to allow complete testing. On March 29, 2007, Judges James Robertson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that USDA had the authority to restrict the use of biological products and to regulate diagnostic testing but that this authority did not extend to the regulation of BSE test kits.Creekstone Farms Premium Beef, L.L.C. v. Dep't of Agric., 517 F. Supp. 2d 8, 13‚Äì17 (D.D.C. 2007). On August 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court's finding of the USDA's authority to restrict the use of biological products and to regulate diagnostic testing but reversed the lower court's ruling that USDA did not have the authority to regulate BSE test kits.Creekstone Farms Premium Beef, L.L.C. v.

He found that men with more older brothers are more likely to be gay than men with fewer older brothers, a phenomenon he attributes to the reaction of the mother's immune system to male fetuses. Blanchard has also published research studies on phallometry and several paraphilias, including autoerotic asphyxia. Education and career Blanchard was born in Hammonton, New Jersey. He received his A.B. in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 and his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1973. He conducted postdoctoral research at Dalhousie University until 1976, when he accepted a position as a clinical psychologist at the Ontario Correctional Institute in Brampton, Ontario, Canada (a suburb of Toronto). There, Blanchard met Kurt Freund, who became his mentor. Freund was conducting research in chemical castration for sex offenders. In 1980, he joined the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry (now part of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health). In 1995 Blanchard was named Head of Clinical Sexology Services in the Law and Mental Health Programme of the CAMH, where he served until 2010. He is an adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. He served on the American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV Subcommittee on Gender Identity Disorders and was named to the DSM-5 committee. According to Google Scholar, Blanchard's works have been cited more than 12,000 times and he has an h-index of 65. Fraternal birth order effect Blanchard has conducted research on factors that influence the development of sexual orientation, including biological factors. He has proposed a theory known as a fraternal birth order effect or older brother effect. This theory is that the more older brothers a man has, the greater the probability is that he will have a homosexual sexual orientation. The number of older sisters has no effect, however. The same is not true for lesbians‚Äîneither the number of older brothers nor the number of older sisters appears to be related to the sexual orientation of women. The fraternal birth order effect has been described by one of its proponents as \\"the most consistent biodemographic correlate of sexual orientation in men\\", with each older brother increasing a man's odds of being gay by about 33%. Blanchard hypothesizes that the older brother effect is caused by interactions between a male fetus and the immune system of the mother: because certain proteins (called H-y antigens) are produced by male and not by female fetuses, the mother's immune system reacts only to male fetuses and is more likely to produce a reaction with each successive exposure to a male fetus. Typology of transsexualism Blanchard coined the term \\"autogynephilia\\" to describe trans women with an erotic desire \\"to be women,\\" and hypothesized that all gender dysphoria experienced by this group is of two types: \\"homosexual\\" gender dysphoria and \\"non-homosexual\\" gender dysphoria. Blanchard defined the former as being present in transsexuals attracted to men, while he defined the latter as being present in transsexuals attracted to the idea of themselves as women. Within the transgender community the idea has been criticized. Blanchard's findings and research have been rejected by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the largest association of medical professionals who provide care for transgender people, as lacking empirical evidence. Blanchard supports public funding of sex reassignment surgery as an appropriate treatment for transsexual people, as he believes the available evidence supports that the surgery helps them live more comfortably and happily, with high satisfaction rates. Blanchard defined autogynephilic as \\"a man's paraphilic tendency to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman\\". He researched this theory by conducting a test on a sample of 119 MtF transsexuals who submitted an anonymous questionnaire to test if they were autogynephilic or homosexual. Blanchard believed that not all transsexuals fit in the category of \\"homosexual\\" and that some were instead autogynephilic transsexuals. Survey participants felt that they were neither homosexual nor autogynephilic transsexuals and should not be classified in either group. A majority felt that the sexual attraction to become a woman weakened with age, but others reported that they had noticed a change after physical transition. Blanchard ultimately concluded that transsexuals were either sexually aroused by men, androphilic, or aroused by the thought of being a woman, nonandrophilic. The number of openly transgender women has rapidly increased over the past several decades. More and more individuals have undergone operations and hormone therapy. They believe that their gender identity, defined as \\"one's inner sense of being male or female, masculine or feminine\\", did not match the body they were in. According to Blanchard, \\"Autogynephilic transsexuals were men who were also sexually attracted to women, but whose paraphilic sexual interest made them want to go farther and permanently change their bodies to become the objects of their attraction\\". The term teleiophilia Blanchard coined the term teleiophilia to refer to a sexual preference for adults. Unlike the terms referring to sexual interest in other age groups, such as pedophilia (sexual interest in prepubescent children), teleiophilia is not considered a paraphilia. The term was formalized in order to forestall neologisms, such as \\"adultophilia\\" or \\"normophilia,\\" that were occasionally used, but had no precise definition. The term is used primarily by professional sexologists in the scientific literature. DSM-5 Appointment Blanchard served on the gender dysphoria sub-working group for the DSM-IV and served as Chair of the paraphilia sub-working group for the DSM-5. Activists protested the latter appointment. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force issued a statement questioning the APA's decision to appoint Blanchard. Paraphilias  In 2008, Blanchard was the lead author of an influential paper proposing the introduction of hebephilia in the DSM-5. The paper, coauthored mostly with colleagues from CAMH and the University of Toronto, triggered a number of reactions, many of them critical on the basis that it pathologizes reproductively valid behavior in order to uphold current social and legal standards. Critics include Richard Green, DSM-IV editor Michael First, forensic psychologist Karen Franklin, and Charles Allen Moser, while others including William O'Donohue argued that the proposal did not go far enough. Blanchard also wrote the literature review paper for the DSM-5 committee regarding pedophilia, in which he summarized and attempted to address the criticism over the DSM-IV-TR definition of pedophilia. The DSM-5 diagnosis initially proposed a new name (\\"pedohebophilic disorder\\") and the rationale for the change cited several of Blanchard's scientific publications. In the end, the pedohebephilic disorder proposal was rejected, but the name was changed from pedophilia to pedophilic disorder, reflecting the DSM-5's general distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder. Blanchard noted that both Richard Green and William O'Donohue remarked that a so-called \\"contented pedophile\\"‚Äîan individual who fantasizes about having sex with a child, but does not commit child sexual abuse, but just masturbates fantasizing it, and who does not feel subjectively distressed afterward‚Äîdoes not meet the DSM-IV- TR criteria for pedophilia, because Criterion B is not met. Whereas Green proposed to solve the problem by removing pedophilia from the DSM, and O'Donohue proposed to remove criterion B for pedophilia, Blanchard proposed a general solution applicable to all paraphilias, namely a distinction between paraphilia and paraphilic disorder. The latter term is proposed to identify the diagnosable condition, which meets both Criterion A and B, whereas an individual who does not meet Criterion B, can be ascertained, but not diagnosed, as having a paraphilia. (Blanchard acknowledges Kenneth Zucker and James Cantor for discussions about this distinction). Interviewed by bioethics professor Alice Dreger, Blanchard explained: \\"We tried to go as far as we could in depathologizing mild and harmless paraphilias, while recognizing that severe paraphilias that distress or impair people or cause them to do harm to others are validly regarded as disorders.\\" References External links *Blanchard Faculty Webpage at the University of Toronto *Blanchard Webpage via Department of Psychiatry *Ray Blanchard profile via American Psychiatric Association *Origins of the Concept of Autogynephilia ‚Äì Written by Blanchard in February 2004 *Ray Blanchard discusses gay brother studies ‚Äì YouTube video Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American sexologists Category:Sexual orientation and medicine Category:Transgender studies academics Category:People from Hammonton, New Jersey Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:American psychologists Category:Canadian psychologists Category:Canadian sexologists ","title":"Ray Blanchard"},{"id":"4533334","text":"Dr. Farid Stino is an Egyptian businessperson.

It is also the most common mount for Photographic enlarger lenses. True Leica Thread-Mount (LTM) is 39 mm in diameter and has a thread of 26 turns-per-inch or threads-per-inch (tpi) (approximately 0.977 mm pitch) of Whitworth thread form. Whitworth threads were then the norm in microscope manufacture. The Royal Microscopical Society (RMS) thread, also known as society thread, is a special 0.8\\" diameter x 36 tpi Whitworth thread used for microscope objective lenses and Leitz was a major manufacturer of microscopes, so the tooling at the plant was already set up to produce the Whitworth thread form. The Soviets in the 1930s produced their early FED cameras in M39√ó1 (39 mm by 1 mm DIN thread). Early Canon cameras also used a different M39 √ó 24 tpi thread mount,. Canon Camera Museum called \\"J-mount\\". True LTM lenses have a flange focal distance of 28.8 mm, though this is of little importance for lenses used on bellows enlargers. The Soviets later adopted the LTM mount for their Zenit single-lens-reflex (SLR) cameras, though with the longer optical registration of 45.2 mm, required to allow the mirror room to flip out of the focal path when a picture was taken. The mount was developed by Oskar Barnack at Leica to provide a system that would allow for the exchange of lenses on their new small film cameras (Leica Type 1 and Leica Type 2), as Zeiss Ikon had indicated that their forthcoming Contax rangefinder cameras would have interchangeable lenses. The LTM system was tested at the request of Leitz on lenses manufactured in small batches by Hugo Meyer in Germany and marketed with a run of Leitz cameras by A. O. Roth in London. The test marketing program was a success, so regular production with Leitz camera bodies and lenses was introduced on the Leica II, and featured on the Leica Standard and Leica III. Until the 1970s the 39 mm mount was the norm for exchangeable lenses in rangefinder cameras. The high cost of quality lenses led to the dual use camera/enlarger of the lenses, hence the fact that enlargers also accept 39 mm lenses. Detail of the mounting of a Leica IIIf Currently, Cosina in Japan ‚Äî many of whose recent products are marketed under the Voigtl√§nder brand ‚Äî and FED in Ukraine continue to produce camera bodies using a true Leica thread-mount. These give amateurs the rare chance of having a very professional camera by combining a used Leica lens with an M39 body at a price well below a real Leica combination. On the other hand, one has to be careful as there are some issues with some bodies not using the same focusing system. Adaptors are available to use M39 lenses with modern digital cameras, such as the Canon EF-M and Sony E mounts.

They were intended for use on the Danube against Austria-Hungary (the China name was to disguise their function). The first four ships‚ÄîGnat, Mantis, Moth and Tarantula‚Äîwere first employed during the World War I Mesopotamian Campaign on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. Design The ships were designed by Yarrow to operate in shallow, fast-flowing rivers, with a shallow draught and a good turn of speed to counter river flow. They were fitted with two reciprocating (VTE) engines operating two propeller shafts to offer some redundancy. The propellers were housed in tunnels to minimise the operating draught. The main armament consisted of two 6 inch guns in single mountings fore and aft. Deployment Aphis, Bee, Ladybird and Scarab were deployed to Port Said, Egypt in 1915-16, Gnat, Mantis, Moth and Tarantula were sent to the Persian Gulf in 1916. Glowworm, Cicala, Cockchafer and Cricket were deployed to the east coast of England in 1916 and had their main armament mountings modified to give higher elevation for anti-Zeppelin work. In 1919, during the Russian Civil War, Glowworm, Cicala, Cockchafer, Cricket, Moth, and Mantis served on the Dvina River (northern Russia, in Arkhangelsk Oblast), fighting in support of White Russian forces. Glowworms captain and some other crew members were killed when a nearby ammunition barge exploded. The crew of Cicala mutinied, as part of a wider wave of unrest in the Royal Navy, and five \\"ringleaders\\" were sentenced to death, later commuted to five years' imprisonment. Between the two world wars, the class were mainly used in the Far East and they were present during the Japanese invasion of China. In 1937, on the Yangtze river, the Japanese attacked , firing on her from a shore battery. A US gunboat, was also attacked, by Japanese aircraft, and sunk. Ladybird sailed the 20 miles to the scene of the sinking, took on board some of the Panay survivors and took them to Shanghai. Scarab and Cricket were off Nanking in 1937 as the Japanese started to bomb the city. In 1939, the original two 6 inch Mk VII 45-calibre guns on and Ladybird were replaced by more modern and 30 inch longer 6-inch Mk XIII 50-calibre guns from the decommissioned battleship . At the start of World War II, three vessels, Cricket, Gnat, and Ladybird, were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet's Inshore Squadron. They joined the monitor and provided bombardment support for the 8th Army. Their shallow draught allowed them to act also as supply and landing vessels, able to get close-in to beaches. In June 1943, Aphis took part in the bombardment of Pantelleria (Operation Corkscrew).

Chukarin was wounded in action, taken prisoner of war near Poltava (Kiev Cauldron) and sent to a prisoner camp in Sandbostel. He then went through a chain of 17 prisoner camps and by the time when he was freed in 1945 weighed only 40 kg. He was not accepted back to the sports institute in Kiev, and studied in a similar institution in Lviv. In 1946 he already competed in gymnastics at the Soviet national championships; next year he finished fifth, and in 1948 won a national title.

He won five more Olympic medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics, including a silver on the floor. He led the Soviet team to the victory at the 1954 World Championships, winning gold in the team all around and the individual all around. In 1957 along with Larisa Latynina, Chukarin was awarded the first ever Order of Lenin given to an athlete.

This family formerly included the genera Urobatis and Urotrygon of the Americas, which are presently recognized as forming their own family Urotrygonidae. Stingarees are found in the Indo- Pacific region, with the greatest diversity off Australia. They are sluggish, bottom-dwelling fish that have been recorded from shallow waters close to shore to deep waters over the upper continental slope. Measuring between long, these rays have oval to diamond-shaped pectoral fin discs and relatively short tails that terminate in leaf-shaped caudal fins, and may also have small dorsal fins and lateral skin folds. Most are smooth-skinned, and some have ornate dorsal color patterns. Stingarees feed on or near the sea floor, consuming small invertebrates and occasionally bony fishes. They are aplacental viviparous, meaning their embryos emerge from eggs inside the uterus, and are sustained to term first by yolk and later by maternally produced histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\"). As far is known, the gestation period lasts around a year and litter sizes tend to be small. Stingarees have one or two relatively large, venomous stinging spines on their tail for defense, with which they can inflict a painful wound on humans. Generally, stingarees have no economic value. Some species form a substantial component of the bycatch of commercial trawl fisheries. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Kapala stingaree (U. kapalensis), one of several newly described urolophids German biologists Johannes M√ºller and Jakob Henle created the genus Urolophus in 1837; in their subsequent 1838-41 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, the pair created the genus Trygonoptera and also made the first reference to the urolophids as a group. The family has traditionally also included the genera Urobatis and Urotrygon of the Americas; John McEachran, Katherine Dunn, and Tsutomu Miyake moved them to their own family, Urotrygonidae, in 1996. Recent phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the urolophids and related taxa belong to the order Myliobatiformes; they were once placed in the order Rajiformes with the guitarfishes and skates. Based on morphological characters, John McEachran and Neil Aschliman determined in a 2004 study that the urolophids formed a clade with the giant stingaree (Plesiobatis daviesi), and that the two were basal to a clade containing all other myliobatiform families except Platyrhinidae, Hexatrygonidae, and Zanobatidae. They proposed including Plesiobatis in the family Urolophidae, and classifying the family within the superfamily Urolophoidea within Myliobatiformes. Distribution and habitat The striped stingaree (T. ovalis) prefers rocky or seagrass habitats. The center of biodiversity for stingarees is Australia, where all 6 Trygonoptera and 15 of the 22 Urolophus species are endemic. A number of species are also found in the Coral Sea, a few in the Malay Archipelago, and one (the sepia stingray, U. aurantiacus) in the northwestern Pacific. Stingarees are bottom- dwelling rays that can be found from very shallow, inshore habitats such as estuaries and bays, to a depth of well offshore on the upper continental shelf. Some are extremely common; one study in the coastal waters of southwestern Australia found that the four most abundant stingaree species constituted over 17% of the biomass of benthic fishes. Description The eastern shovelnose stingaree (T. imitata), which has a rounded disc and no dorsal fin or lateral skin folds on its tail. Stingarees are modestly sized, ranging from long. They have greatly enlarged pectoral fins fused to the head, forming a disc that may be nearly circular, to oval, to rhomboid in shape. The snout is usually short and does not protrude much from the disc. The eyes are placed atop the disc and usually fairly large; immediately posterior are teardrop-shaped spiracles (auxiliary respiratory openings). There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils, formed from the fusion of the anterior nasal flaps, that reaches the mouth. There are varying numbers of papillae (nipple- like structures) on the floor of the mouth and sometimes also on the outside of the lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small, with rhomboid bases and blunt to pointed crowns; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern and number less than 50 rows in either jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are short and located beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small with rounded margins; claspers are found on males. The tail is shorter than to about equal to the disc, either flattened or thickly oval in cross-section, and ends in a leaf- shaped, symmetrical caudal fin. One or two relatively large, serrated stinging spines are placed atop the tail about halfway along its length. Some species have a small dorsal fin immediately before the spine, and/or lateral skin folds running along either side of the tail. All species lack dermal denticles (except for the New Ireland stingaree, U. armatus). Stingarees are generally shades of yellow, green, brown or gray above and pale below; some species are plain, while others are adorned with spots, rings, blotches, lines, or more complex patterns. Biology and ecology One of the most common stingarees off southern Australia, the sparsely-spotted stingaree (U. paucimaculatus) feeds mainly on crustaceans. Stingarees are slow swimmers that can often be found lying still on the bottom, sometimes partly or completely buried in sediment. They are predators of small benthic and burrowing invertebrates such as crustaceans and polychaete worms, and also occasionally small bony fishes. Studies have shown that stingarees that overlap in range differ in their diet composition, which likely serves to reduce competition. For example, off southwestern Australia the masked stingaree (T. personata) and western shovelnose stingaree (T. mucosa) feed mostly on different types of polychaetes, while the sparsely-spotted stingaree (U. paucimaculatus) and lobed stingaree (U. lobatus) feed mostly on different types of crustaceans. Like other myliobatiforms, stingarees have a viviparous mode of reproduction in which the embryos hatch within the uterus and are nourished first by yolk, and later by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother and likely delivered through specialized extensions of the uterine epithelium called \\"trophonemata\\". For those species whose life histories have been investigated, the gestation period lasts 10-12 months and the litter size is small, no more than one or two in some cases. The small litter is likely due to the relatively large size of stingaree pups, which measure around half the maximum size at birth. Human interactions Though generally innocuous towards humans, when disturbed stingarees can inflict a painful wound with their stout, venomous stings. Species differ in temperament; the sparse-spotted stingaree (U. paucimaculatus) is reportedly more aggressive, and the spotted stingaree (U. gigas) less so. When threatened, the crossback stingaree (U. cruciatus) raises its tail over its disc like a scorpion. Some species of stingarees are regularly caught incidentally in bottom trawls by commercial fisheries. They are generally discarded due to their small size, though some may be processed into fishmeal. Stingarees caught from shallow water likely have relatively high chances of survival, but of concern is their tendency to abort any gestating young when captured and handled.

Dennis Gabor invented holography in 1948 when he tried to improve resolution in electron microscope. The first attempts to perform holography with electron waves were made by Haine and Mulvey in 1952; they recorded holograms of zinc oxide crystals with 60 keV electrons, demonstrating reconstructions with approximately 1 nm resolution. In 1955, G. M√∂llenstedt and H. D√ºker invented an electron biprism. thus enabling the recording of electron holograms in off-axis scheme. There are many different possible configurations for electron holography, with more than 20 documented in 1992 by Cowley. Usually, high spatial and temporal coherence (i.e. a low energy spread) of the electron beam are required to perform holographic measurements. High-energy electron holography in off- axis scheme Electron holography with high-energy electrons (80-200 keV) can be realized in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) in an off-axis scheme. Electron beam is split into two parts by very thin positively charged wire. Positive voltage deflects the electron waves so that they overlap and produce an interference pattern of equidistantly spaced fringes. An illustration to off-axis electron holography in transmission electron microscope. Reconstruction of off-axis holograms is done numerically and it consists of two mathematical transformations. First, a Fourier transform of the hologram is performed. The resulting complex image consists of the autocorrelation (center band) and two mutually conjugated sidebands. Only one side band is selected by applying a low-pass filter (round mask) centered on the chosen side-band. The central band and the twin side-band are both set to zero. Next, the selected side-band is re-positioned to the center of the complex image and the backward Fourier-transform is applied. The resulting image in the object domain is complex-valued, and thus, the amplitude and phase distributions of the object function are reconstructed. Electron holography in in-line scheme Original holographic scheme by Dennis Gabor is inline scheme, which means that reference and object wave share the same optical axis. This scheme is also called point projection holography. An object is placed into divergent electron beam, part of the wave is scattered by the object (object wave) and it interferes with the unscattered wave (reference wave) in detector plane. The spatial coherence in in-line scheme is defined by the size of the electron source. Holography with low-energy electrons (50-1000 eV) can be realized in in-line scheme.Inline electron holography scheme. Electromagnetic fields It is important to shield the interferometric system from electromagnetic fields, as they can induce unwanted phase-shifts due to the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm effect. Static fields will result in a fixed shift of the interference pattern. It is clear every component and sample must be properly grounded and shielded from outside noise. Applications At this image one can see the electron hologram of a latex sphere on a carbon coating with gold particles (black dots), at the lower part of the image is vacuum. The biprism is approx above the vacuum edge; parallel to this edge one can see the phase planes of the interferogram, which is part of the image and from which the phase information can be extracted. Electron holography is commonly used to study electric and magnetic fields in thin films, as magnetic and electric fields can shift the phase of the interfering wave passing through the sample.R. E. Dunin-Borkowski et al., Micros. Res. and Tech. 64, 390 (2004). The principle of electron holography can also be applied to interference lithography.

It was the first major site excavated in Palestine, first by Flinders Petrie in 1890 and later by Frederick Jones Bliss in 1891 and 1892, both sponsored by the Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF). Petrie's excavations were one of the first to systematically use stratigraphy and seriation to produce a chronology of the site. Tell el-Hesi is located southwest of the modern Israeli city of Qiryat Gat. History The site was occupied from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period to the Hellenistic period, though not continuously. The city reached a size of 25 acres in the Early Bronze Age during the middle of the 3rd Millennium BCE. It then fell into disuse until the middle of the 2nd millennium during the Late Bronze Age when it was rebuilt, staying in use for around a thousand years. A military trench system was dug into the top of the mound during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Petrie identified Tell el-Hesi as the Biblical site of Lachish, and Bliss accepted this identification, but it is no longer accepted. In 1924 William F. Albright proposed that Tell el-Hesi was Biblical Eglon, an identification still accepted by Yohanan Aharoni in the 1970s. This identification, too, is unlikely and the site should be considered unidentified. Archaeology Cross section through the mound, after Flinders Petrie The site was first described in 1838 by Edward Robinson.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, pp. 390‚Äì392 It is 200 feet above the land in the East and 60 feet high in the other directions. The mound was roughly square with 200 feet on a side in Robinson's time but has been reduced by excavations and military action. It was originally excavated between 1890 and 1892 by the PEF during five excavation seasons. After brief training under Petrie at Meydum in Egypt, Bliss began two years work at Tell el-Hesi. Using Petrie's ceramic sequence and the pioneering concept of a sequence of 'cities', Bliss was able to establish not only the archaeology of this specific site, but the sequential framework for Levantine archaeology. The final reports were published in 1891 and 1894. Among other discoveries was the remains of what was identified as a blast furnace, with slag and ashes, which was dated to 1500 BC. If the theories of experts are correct, the use of the hot-air blast instead of cold air was known at an extremely early age. Aside from some inscribed pottery of various periods, the significant epigraphic find was a single cuneiform tablet. This tablet is closely related to the Amarna Letters and mentions a person noted as the governor of Lachish in those letters. A second series of excavations began in 1970, at the behest of the American Schools of Oriental Research and its President G. Ernest Wright, the Joint Archaeological Expedition to Tell el-Hesi. The original core staff of directors for the project included John Worrell - Director; Lawrence Toombs - Senior Archeologist, Phillip King - Administrative Director, Tom Frank - Education Director, and W. J. Bennett, Jr. and Lawrence Stager as Field Directors. The team excavated at the site from 1970 to 1983 for eight summer seasons. The project emphasized excavation in two parts of the site: the acropolis and its associated wall system (Fields I and III), and the Early Bronze III (EB III) wall system of the lower city (Fields V, VI, and IX).

The game is heavily influenced by the 1982 Atari 8-bit family game Shamus, which was itself inspired by the 1980 arcade game Berzerk. Gameplay The player controls a man who has penetrated the electrified Cybertron Fortress, in order to retrieve the priceless treasures within: golden keys, rings and bars. The player character has 8-directional movement, and may shoot in the direction he is facing. The objective of each level was to find all the listed treasure, and then touch the safe, located at a random position on the level. The amount of treasure required increased by one item every level, up to the maximum of six. Cybertron Mission had four maze-like levels, repeating the series every four levels, with palette shifts in order to make them appear different. There are four enemy types. Spinners (appearing on all levels) move blindly towards the player, but cannot harm him even when touching, unless he walks into them. Clones (appearing from level 2 onwards) move pseudo-randomly, and shoot in the direction they were moving/facing. Cyberdroids (appearing from level 3 onwards) move in straight lines for a period. They change direction when they hit a wall, see the player, or after a certain period of time. They will fire towards the player. The fourth enemy type is Spook, the ghost of a previous entrant to the fortress. He appears if you spend too long on any one screen, moving towards you and ignoring walls. He cannot be destroyed, but may be paralysed if shot. Touching the electrified walls of the maze kills the player. Cybertron Mission does not end, each level simply brings a greater number of enemies to fight, which fire more frequently and with greater accuracy.

There is no cultural giant to be found--no Florence or Naples--that might have shaped the cultural and musical expressions of the entire region. There is not a town in the region with more than 100,000 population, but there are 246 total towns, and they support no fewer than 113 theaters, a cultural building boom that started in the late 18th century. Historically, the entire area was home to a great number of monasteries and abbeys in the Middle Ages, institutions that had choirs and were active in the musical lives of the inhabitants. That period is still obscure and is currently the subject of musicological research. In the modern age, the region has a vibrant musical life. Musical venues and activities Giovanni Battista Pergolesi Historically, the city of Ancona was known as a small center for music agencies, music printers and makers of stringed instrument. The main theater is the Teatro delle Muse (\\"Theater of the muses\\"), now reopened after reconstruction in the wake of a World War II bombing. It is the home of the Marche Philharmonic Orchestra. The town of Jesi has the Teatro Pergolesi and supports the Pergolesi Foundation, both named for this \\"favorite son\\" composer and one of the great names in the music of the 18th century in Italy. Ascoli Piceno is the site of the historic Teatro Ventidio Basso whereas Fermo is home to Teatro dell'Aquila and a new music conservatory. The town of Fermo is home to the International Orchestra of Italy, a fine private orchestra with a 20-year history of concerts in Italy and abroad. Macerata is the site of the remarkable Arena Sferisterio. Flanked by neo-classical columns, it is an outdoor venue for music, or almost anything else, having been built in the 1820s as a sports field. The town of Civitanova Marche has the S. Giacomo Auditorium, which hosts an annual festival of contemporary music. Gioachino Rossini, c. 1815 (portrait by Vincenzo Camuccini) The town of Pesaro is the birthplace of Rossini, one of the giants of Italian music. As one might expect, many things are named for him, including the Teatro Rossini and the Rossini Conservatory. His birthplace is marked, as well, and the Rossini Foundation sponsors an annual festival dedicated to his music. The town of Urbino has the Teatro Sanzio, built in the 1840s, and the town of Fano has an important Jazz Festival each year. References *Guide Cultura, i luoghi della musica (2003) ed.

The first book of the Dr. Kay Scarpetta series, it received the 1991 Edgar Award for Best First Novel. Plot summary The novel opens as Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth of Virginia, receives an early-morning call from Sergeant Pete Marino, a homicide detective at the Richmond Police Department with whom Scarpetta has a tense working relationship. She meets him at the scene of a woman's gruesome strangling, the latest in a string of unsolved murders in Richmond. The killer leaves behind a few clues; among them are a mysterious substance which fluoresces under laser light, which was later on proved to be from a liquid soap which the killer used to wash his hands, traces of semen, and in the vicinity of the last murder, an unusual smell. Scarpetta and Marino work with FBI profiler Benton Wesley to attempt to piece together a profile of the killer. Initial evidence appears to point to the fourth victim's husband, but Scarpetta suspects otherwise despite Marino's insistence. The book references DNA profiling as a relatively new technique, and characters briefly bemoan the lack of a criminal DNA database which could provide better leads to suspects, given available evidence. Meanwhile in her personal life, Scarpetta must deal with the presence of her extremely precocious ten-year-old niece, Lucy, as well as an uncertain romantic relationship with the local Commonwealth's attorney. During the investigation, a series of news leaks about the murders appear to be coming from a source within the medical examiner's office. The leaks threaten Scarpetta's position, especially after she is forced to admit that her office database has been compromised. Believing that the killer thrives on media attention and hoping to flush him out by provoking his ego, Scarpetta, Wesley, and local investigative reporter Abby Turnbull (whose sister was the fifth victim), conspire to release a news story which suggests that the killer has a distinctive body odour due to a rare metabolic disease and implies that the killer may be mentally disordered. While attempting to find another link between the five murders, Scarpetta discovers that all five intended victims had recently called 911; she suspects that the killer is a 911 operator and chose his victims based on their voices. Scarpetta is awakened in the middle of the night by the killer, who has broken into her home. As she attempts to reach for a gun she has nearby for protection, Marino bursts into her bedroom and shoots the intruder, having realized that the news article would make Scarpetta a likely target. Scarpetta's suspicion proves to be correct; the killer was a 911 dispatcher.

Its name is a portmanteau of Frankenstein, the fictional doctor who combined body parts to create a monster, and the Fender Stratocaster, an electric guitar made by Fender. A copy of the Frankenstrat is housed in the National Museum of American History, part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. The Frankenstrat was Van Halen's attempt to combine the sound of a classic Gibson guitar with the physical attributes and tremolo bar functionality of a Fender Stratocaster. It was made from a Northern Ash Stratocaster body, with pickup routing which he modified to fit a Gibson PAF humbucking bridge pickup. The guitar has a maple neck and fretboard, chrome hardware, and was painted with a black and white striped design until arriving at its final combination of red background with black and white stripes. It has six strings and a Floyd Rose tremolo. In April 2019, the Metropolitan Museum of Art displayed the Frankenstrat guitar as part of the \\"Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock and Roll\\" exhibit.https://www.vhnd.com/2019/04/01/eddie-van-halens-1978-touring-rig-and- original-frankenstein-guitar-exhibit/ Design Body and neck Van Halen bought the Frankenstrat's northern ash body and maple neck (which was a factory reject) for $130 from Wayne Charvel and Lynn Ellsworth, who sold Boogie Body bodies and necks. Van Halen was able to purchase the factory second body at a discount price of $50 due to a knot in the wood. The $80 neck had jumbo fret wire, and its truss rod was adjustable at the heel. Bridge and pickup The guitarist originally used the Fender tremolo system from his 1958 Fender Stratocaster, adding the Floyd Rose later. He equipped the Frankenstrat with a PAF (\\"patent applied for\\") pickup removed from his Gibson ES-335, potting the pickup in paraffin wax to reduce microphonic feedback. He then screwed the pickup to the guitar in the bridge position, slightly offset from perpendicular to the strings, to compensate for the different string spacing between the Gibson's pickup and the Fender's bridge. This pickup was later replaced by a Seymour Duncan humbucker. Controls Van Halen removed both tone-control potentiometers, wiring the pickups in a simple circuit largely due to his limited knowledge of electronics. He placed a knob marked \\"Tone\\" on the volume-control pot, then used a vinyl record that he'd shaped into a pick guard to cover the controls. This pick guard was later replaced by a real, similarly-shaped pick guard. Although it has five mounting holes (one drilled by Van Halen), it was installed with only three screws. A strip of double-sided masking tape was added near the pick guard, on which Van Halen placed a variety of picks. The simple circuit consisted of a single humbucking pick-up, an A500k potentiometer (the volume control) and a 1/4-inch output jack. Finish Van Halen painted the guitar black, and when it was dry he put strips of gaffer tape on the body and repainted it white. He repeated the process with red, creating the classic Frankenstrat.Bruck, part 2. Van Halen put a Gibson decal on the headstock, emphasizing the \\"cross-pollination\\" between Gibson and Fender. Because companies began selling guitars with similar finishes, and because he felt that the guitar was being too badly damaged from overuse, he stopped playing the Frankenstrat in public, instead using the black-and-yellow \\"bumblebee\\" guitar pictured on Van Halen II (1979). In 1979, disappointed with the bumblebee's performance, Van Halen re-taped the body of the Frankenstrat and painted it with red Schwinn bicycle paint. According to the guitarist, \\"The Schwinn bicycle paint gives it pop.\\" Upgrades The Frankenstrat has gone through a number of necks over the years, and its bridge has evolved from the 1958 Fender tremolo to original Floyd Rose bridges (with and without fine tuners). The placement of the 1971 quarter was to keep the Floyd Rose bridge flush with the body when he would drop tune during live songs, and Van Halen attached bicycle reflectors to the rear of the body so he could flip the guitar over to reflect stage lights onto the crowd. He installed large screw eyes instead of strap buttons, a foolproof method of securing the guitar to the strap. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many guitar companies tried to capitalize on Van Halen's popularity by manufacturing Frankenstrat replicas. In 1979, he replaced the original black pickguard with a white pickguard. He later replaced the white pickguard with a cut up black vinyl record and covered the back with aluminum foil. In 1981, he replaced the vinyl record with a trimmed piece of a 3-ply black Fender pickguard to cover the control cavity, and put a second pickup in the neck position, a Mighty Mite single coil with a red phenolic bobbin. To confuse imitators, he screwed a three-way switch sideways into the middle position cavity. In an interview, Eddie admitted the single-coil pickup and middle switch were not connected to anything. Variants Kramers Kramer Guitars was the first company endorsed by Van Halen in 1983, when it built a Frankenstrat replica, and during this time he replaced the original Frankenstrat neck with a Kramer neck which first seen on \\"Jump\\" music video. In 1984 he was given the \\"Hot for Teacher\\" guitar (seen in the song's video clip), and began appearing in Kramer advertisements. Paul Unkert, the \\"Guitar Guy\\" of UNK guitars, worked on the Frankenstrat and put his \\"Unk\\" stamp on it. The best-known Kramer owned by Van Halen was the 5150, which he built in the Kramer factory. Although it was thought that the guitar was made from a Kramer Baretta body, it had a prototype Pacer body. The guitar, used from the 1984 tour through the OU812 tour, was last used to record \\"Judgement Day\\" for the album For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991). Although the 5150 reappeared on the 2004 reunion tour with Sammy Hagar, the guitar upgraded with a Charvel neck and EVH Wolfgang humbucker, it is now retired. A number of other Kramers were also built and used by Van Halen during this time (most notably the 1984 Kramer), although most were simply striped designs without other markings. These guitars were primarily backups for the 5150 on tours, and were retired at the same time. Some were given away, or (like the 1984 Kramer) awarded in contests. Charvel hybrid VH2 The second Frankenstrat, appearing on the Van Halen II LP and tour, was a 1979 Charvel hybrid VH2 \\"Bumblebee\\" black-and- yellow striped guitar. It was buried with Dimebag Darrell of Pantera in a Kiss Kasket, who had asked for a Charvel Art Series replica before they were released; Van Halen was said to have presented the original guitar at his funeral. Ibanez Destroyer This guitar was a dual-humbucker instrument created from an Ibanez Destroyer made from korina. Van Halen removed a large chunk of the wood with a hacksaw, giving it an open-jaws shape. It was nicknamed the \\"Shark\\" because the chunk he cut out was serrated, resembling shark teeth. This guitar was used in the videos for \\"Runnin' with the Devil\\" and \\"You Really Got Me\\". The removal of the wood destroyed the guitar's sound, and it was retired. To record \\"Women and Children First\\", Van Halen borrowed a Destroyer from the then-unknown Chris Holmes. Fender-Charvel Charvel introduced a signature-model Eddie Van Halen guitar, the Charvel EVH Art Series Guitar equipped with a single custom-wound pickup and a Floyd Rose locking tremolo, in three colors: white with black stripes, black with yellow stripes and red with black-and-white stripes. The guitars have a neck profile similar to the original Frankenstrat. Three hundred replicas of the red-and- black-and-white-striped Frankenstrat were offered by Van Halen's EVH brand for $25,000 each. About 180 were sold in the United States, and the remainder overseas. In 2018, Fender-EVH added the '78 Eruption model, followed by the 2019 '79 Bumblebee replica. All three guitars are meticulously recreated to include parts as close to the original as possible. Van Halen himself has stated that the red-black-white Frankenstrat replicas feel and sound better than the original guitar built in the 1970s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2mh7zGfFRM Guitar Hero: Van Halen The Frankenstrat's paintjob was used in the box art for Guitar Hero: Van Halen. It also appears a number of times in the game, including transitions at the end of songs; the stripes appear one by one in quick succession, and are then removed. 2012 tour For the band's 2012 tour, Van Halen used a variant of the Frankenstrat with the black-and-white capped-bridge pickup from his Wolfgang models, a maple Wolfgang neck with a black headstock and a Wolfgang-style volume knob. It is unknown if this is the original, a replica prototype, one of the replica models or a custom-built guitar. EVH In 2013 Van Halen's brand, EVH, released a line of replicas based on previous Frankenstrats. There are three, based on the Charvel \\"Bumblebee\\", the original pick-guarded Frankenstrat and the red, white and black Frankenstrat, with hardware similar to that of the EVH Wolfgangs. Capitalising on the aforementioned EVH Frankenstrat replica guitars, EVH-Fender released a more budget-friendly Frankenstrat replica (named \\"Franky\\") under the Striped Series moniker. EVH also sells a Frankenstrat replica pickup, wired (supposedly) to the same specs as Van Halen's original PAF.

In such a league, the \\"best\\" team is not significantly better than the \\"worst\\" team. This leads to more competitive contests where the winner cannot be easily predicted in advance. The opposite condition, which could be considered \\"disparity\\" between teams, is a condition where the elite teams are so much more talented that the lesser teams are hopelessly outmatched. Different major governing organizations attempt to achieve financial and/or competitive parity in different ways. For example, the National Football League (NFL) in the U.S. has established the shared revenue plan, in which all teams equally benefit from television revenue and sales of NFL franchised goods. All of the major leagues of North America use a draft system to ensure that the best prospects are allocated to the teams most in need of them. In much of the world outside North America, parity is enforced through promotion and relegation: the weakest teams in a league are forcibly expelled from the league and switch places with the best teams in a lower league. Many consider the NFL to be the most \\"fair\\" or competitive league, with many different teams having a chance to win each year. In the NFL, complete parity would be a state where on any given Sunday, any given team can win any given game. The illusion of parity in the NFL may be somewhat of a misconception; the New England Patriots, in particular, were noted for a prolonged dynasty in the 21st century under starting quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick that league policies failed to break up. The Cleveland Browns has a playoff drought that is currently () over a decade long; prior to 2017, the longest playoff drought in the NFL belonged to the Patriots' division rivals, the Buffalo Bills, who were also harmed by Buffalo's small market, high taxes, and poor reputation as a destination city. A franchise can be struggling and the reason for it can be due to the team's ineptitude when it comes evaluating talent, coaching strategies, developing players, having a good organizational structure, and overall team and player operations; a league with parity would, in theory, allow such struggling teams to identify and fix these issues while ensuring that a dynasty cannot take hold. Expansion teams are among the most difficult to bring to parity. Especially in sports where team chemistry is an important factor in success, expansion team players (who consist mostly of cast-offs from other teams) must learn to work as a team before success happens, a process that can take years. Two notable exceptions were the Baltimore Stallions, who reached the Grey Cup in both their seasons in the Canadian Football League (winning the latter appearance); and the Vegas Golden Knights, who reached the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season in the National Hockey League. An example of disparity in sports is Portuguese Liga, the top-flight professional football (soccer) league in Portugal, where three clubs have accounted for 75 of the 77 championships in league history. Salary cap limits set a maximum amount of money that may be spent on athletes' contracts. These limits exist to different extents in several other leagues as well. For example, Major League Baseball (MLB) in the U.S. does not have a cap, but charges a luxury tax beyond a certain level. Another example of disparity would be demonstrated by the NBA from the 2014‚Äì15 NBA season to the 2017‚Äì18 NBA season, where the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers have been the only franchises to reach the NBA Finals during that specific time span and during the 2017 NBA finals and the 2018 NBA finals the Golden State Warriors won 8 out of the possible 9 finals games. Prolonged disparity can be severely detrimental to a sports league. The All-America Football Conference collapsed in part because one of its teams, the Cleveland Browns, dominated the league throughout its four-year existence.

The Folio Society, 2011. Retrieved 19 December 2011. It produces illustrated hardback editions of classic fiction and non-fiction books, poetry and children's titles. Folio editions feature specially designed bindings and include artist-commissioned illustrations (most often in fiction titles) or researched artworks and photographs (in non-fiction titles). Most editions come with their own slipcase. The Folio Society for many years had a bookshop in Holborn, London, but the bookshop closed in December 2016 when the company moved premises. Folio editions can be purchased only online through their website, post or over the telephone. Some editions are stocked in independent bookstores, Blackwell's in Oxford; Selfridges, Harrods and Hatchards in London also stock them. History The Folio Society was founded in 1947 by Charles Ede, Christopher Sandford (of Golden Cockerel Press), and Alan Bott (founder of Pan Books). The firm's goal was to produce \\"editions of the world's great literature, in a format worthy of the contents, at a price within the reach of everyman.\\"Charles Ede Obituary in The Telegraph, 6 June 2002. Retrieved 21 December 2011. Archived here. Folio and the Golden Cockerel Press shared premises in Poland Street until 1955. Subsequent offices were located in the Mayfair and Borough areas of London. The Folio Society moved to its location in 44 Eagle Street, Holborn, in 1994 ‚Äì in 2017, their offices moved to 4 Maguire Street, London. The society issued its first three titles in 1947. In October of that year Tolstoy's Tales went on sale for sixteen shillings (this would have been about US$3 in 1947, or just over US$33 in 2018.) Tales was followed in November and December by George du Maurier's Trilby and a translation of Aucassin et Nicolette, establishing a pattern of monthly publication. In 1971 The Folio Society was incorporated and purchased by John Letts and Halfdan Lynner. Under their ownership, The Folio Society published the collected novels of Dickens, Trollope, Hardy, Elizabeth Gaskell and Conrad. Lord Gavron was owner and chairman of The Folio Society from 1982 until his death in 2015. Membership and non-member sales At its inception, The Folio Society operated as a membership-based organisation; as the list of titles grew, the membership commitment was established as 4 books per year. Since 2011, anyone has been able to purchase from the Folio Society list without committing to membership. On 1 September 2016, the company ended its membership-based structure. Production trends and bindings The company currently publishes more than 60 titles a year, including multi-volume sets. Most titles are digitally typeset, then printed by offset at printers in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Until 1954, most Folio books were issued with printed dust jackets, but during the latter half of the 1950s coloured card slip cases were introduced, to protect the books and retain focus on the decorative bindings. Solander boxes are generally used to protect the limited editions. Folio publications are printed in a range of standard sizes (in 1951, for example, these included Royal Octavo, Medium Octavo, Crown Octavo and Demy Octavo), and custom sizes are also employed. The most common material for bindings is buckram or a similar bookcloth, but there are many exceptions: aluminium foil was used in binding Aldous Huxley's Brave New World in 1971, and vegetable parchment in binding Voltaire's The Calas Affair in 1994; more commonly, marbled papers (often produced by Ann Muir Marbling Ltd.) have been used for several volumes in recent years, either as endpapers or as board-papers of quarter bindings; moir√© silk (usually artificial) has been used sporadically over the years as a binding material, and leather (vellum and goatskin) and bonded leather are sometimes used, chiefly for the more expensive editions. Most bindings for works of fiction are designed by the illustrator. Non-fiction binding designers include David Eccles, Jeff Clements, and Neil Gower. Beginning in 2007, the company used traditional letterpress printing (the method which Johannes Gutenberg devised in the middle of the fifteenth century) to publish each of Shakespeare's plays, as well as the Sonnets and Poems, in large-format editions. This landmark project of 39 volumes was finally completed in 2014.

Membership of the AECB includes local authorities, housing associations, builders, architects, designers, consultants and manufacturers. The association was founded in 1989 to increase awareness within the construction industry of the need to respect, protect, preserve and enhance the environment and to develop, share and promote best practice in environmentally sustainable building. Less is More On 30 January 2012 the AECB released its report Less is More: Energy Security after Oil which was published at the end of an unprecedented fifteen years in UK energy policy history. It began with the formal acceptance of the need for a climate change policy by the last Conservative Government in 1997 and culminated with the Climate Change Act 2008 and the 4th Carbon Budget. Less is More is a significant new contribution to the debate and offers an alternative to the emerging orthodoxy of large- scale electrification of heat and road transport as a way to achieve or beat the UK's 2050 CO2 emissions target. This is based on more vigorous and systematic pursuit of energy efficiency throughout the economy; on technologies such as large-scale solar heat, piped to urban buildings; a road and air transport system synthesising liquid fuels in part from renewable electricity, supplementing the biofuel resource; a small electricity supply system, supplied largely by despatchable sources, assisting with network security; and the more vigorous pursuit of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration options, particularly in the biosphere. Less is More contends that an electric future is more costly and could be slower to deliver significant CO2 reductions than the alternatives. Vigorous pursuit of energy efficiency, plus biosequestration, plus more focus on UK energy uses and the characteristics of energy systems, sets the stage for significantly cheaper and more secure energy supply options. Less-electric futures appear to have the capacity to deliver CO2 reductions both more cheaply and more quickly than more-electric. Cumulative emissions to 2050 are at least as important as emissions in the year 2050. The report highlights key areas for technology, product and supply chain development. They include piped heat, which is a mature technology in several of Britain's continental neighbours, and heats over 60% of Danish buildings, but remains uncommon in the UK. They include high-performance insulation systems that could significantly reduce losses in heat storage and distribution systems at all scales, along with renewable fuel production. Heat networks play a systematic role in the scenario, opening up access to large- scale solar, geothermal and waste heat resources at lower costs than new electricity sources and reducing the risk that the UK will be unable to keep the lights on. Less is More contains a critique of the dysfunctionality of UK energy markets. The authors note that water is supplied by vertically- integrated and regulated local monopolies, which have access to capital at near-public sector interest rates, especially if they are debt-funded. They pose the question of why such arrangements cannot be used again in the energy sector, paralleling as it happens the situation with some private US utilities and with utilities in Denmark. The report does not offer the prospect of an easy path to energy independence and decarbonisation. It makes it very clear that all options pose acute difficulties. But it warns policy-makers not to reject technologies just because they appear difficult without making sober comparisons with the reality of the other technologies under consideration.Extract from Foreword by Prof. Robert Lowe Deputy Director and Prof. Tadj Oreszczyn, Director Energy Institute, UCL AECB Silver Certification AECB Silver Certification is a self-certification scheme open to building projects that meet the AECB Silver Standard design and performance criteria. The AECB self-certification route has been developed whereby the self certifier (typically the building's energy consultant) takes responsibility for certification and for underwriting the Silver Standard claim. AECB Silver compliance cannot be assumed unless the building has been modelled in PHPP:de:Passivhaus#PHPP-Standard des Passivhaus Institutes .28Qualit.C3.A4tsgepr.C3.BCftes Passivhaus.29 (passivhaus planning software) and construction quality has been verified. The AECB self-certification process is designed to make explicit the project's claim to be a low energy design and to provide the consumer with a degree of protection under trading standards - without the AECB having to get involved in quality control and legal matters. This approach puts the responsibility for performance claims clearly with the person signing the certificate and a duty of care on the client to ensure that the consultant is competent and suitably insured. Low- carbon building While the AECB recognises that all aspects of sustainability are important, it believes that climate change threatens to overwhelm its members' achievements in other areas. It is therefore currently focusing on trying to help reduce carbon emissions related to domestic and non-domestic buildings in the UK (around 50% of UK CO emissions - excluding flying - relate to buildings). The association believes that the Government's target of a 60% reduction in CO emissions by 2050 is too little, too late, and that a reduction of at least 85% is required to meet the challenges of climate change. Low-carbon standards To promote low-carbon building, the association has developed two advanced energy standards and adopted a third, in order to provide three steps to low energy and low carbon buildings achievable by the UK over the next 40 years. These standards are largely based on the methodology and principles underlying the German Passivhaus movement, developed by the Passivhaus Institut, and are also informed by American, Canadian, Scandinavian and European energy standards and various successful energy efficient building programmes. The standards themselves lie at the centre of a developing education and training programme which the AECB has called the 'Carbon Literate Design and Construction Programme' (CLP). The 'Step One' standard (Silver) is close to the Canadian R-2000, the German Low Energy House (Niedrigenergiehaus), and the Swiss MINERGIE Standard. The AECB has aimed this Standard at those wishing to create high-performance buildings using widely available technology at little or no extra cost. It estimates that, what is states is a low-risk option, will reduce overall CO‚ÇÇ emissions by 70% compared with the UK average for buildings of each type - a result it feels is highly significant given the relative ease and low cost with which this standard could be met. Step Two, the Passivhaus (or Passive house) Standard takes full advantage of existing energy-efficient technology without entailing the perceived risk associated with radical innovation. A considerable improvement on normal UK building practices, the AECB estimates that the Passivhaus standard would reduce overall CO‚ÇÇ emissions by approximately 80% compared with the UK average for buildings of each type. The AECB estimates that Step Three, the Gold Standard, would reduce overall CO‚ÇÇ emissions by 95% compared with the UK average for buildings of each type, since this standard is almost identical to the Passivhaus Standard in terms of thermal efficiency but sets even lower limits on CO‚ÇÇ emissions and overall primary energy use. As well as a requirement for energy-efficient electrical appliances, this standard demands a greater emphasis on electricity-producing renewables to offset power used for lighting, appliances and ventilation. The AECB, believing that rigorous alternative approaches based on successful overseas' experience for sustainable design and construction have a complementary place alongside UK government initiatives, has been lobbying for the Government's Code for Sustainable Homes to be aligned with its CLP, or at least for the CLP (despite its methodological and base-line measuring differences) to be treated as an alternative official route for effectively designing and delivering low energy and low carbon buildings. The AECB has taken the stance of inviting the design and construction industry to judge for itself, based on actual real world performance of the resulting buildings, which low carbon design codes and programmes best deliver genuinely low energy and low carbon performance cost effectively. Low Energy Buildings Database A guiding principle of the AECB is to focus on what really works in practice, to deliver buildings with genuinely improved environmental performance. The AECB established the AECB/CarbonLite Buildings Performance Database with the support of the Technology Strategy Board to show people what could actually be achieved in reality, as opposed to what people hoped they might achieve when developing the design. The database draws on the collective experience of AECB members, and now also the team‚Äôs involved in the Retrofit for the Future projects, and shares that learning. Almost uniquely, this database gives an honest account to anyone planning a low energy building of what can be achieved, along with a detailed account of how it has been done. The database includes information on both refurbishment and new build projects, in both the domestic and non-domestic sectors. The database shows the performance of each building, in both figures and clearly presented graphs. Design intention can easily be compared with built reality, and projects can easily be compared with each other. For each project you can see detailed design strategies, descriptions and illustrations of the building type, the measures taken and technologies employed. As the monitoring figures accumulate, the database will offer increasing numbers of well-illustrated and robust benchmarks for the energy and carbon performance levels that can be achieved, across a wide range of building types.

Etymology The terms are directly from Latin, in which hamus means \\"hook\\". The plural is hami. Hamulus is the diminutive ‚Äì hooklet or little hook. The plural is hamuli. Adjectives are hamate and hamulate, as in \\"a hamulate wing-coupling\\", in which the wings of certain insects in flight are joined by hooking hamuli on one wing into folds on a matching wing. Hamulate can also mean \\"having hamuli\\". The terms hamose, hamular, hamous and hamiform also have been used to mean \\"hooked\\", or \\"hook-shaped\\". Terms such as hamate that do not indicate a diminutive usually refer particularly to a hook at the tip, whereas diminutive terms such as hamulose tend to imply that something is beset with small hooks. Anatomy Human left hand with hamulus of hamate bone shown in red In vertebrate anatomy, a hamulus is a small, hook- shaped portion of a bone, or possibly of other hard tissue. In human anatomy, examples include: * pterygoid hamulus * hamulus of hamate bone * lacrimal hamulus Arthropoda In arthropod morphology hamuli are hooklets, usually in the form of projections of the surface of the exoskeleton. Hami might be actual evaginations of the whole thickness of the exoskeleton. The best-known examples are probably the row of hamuli on the anterior edge of the metathoracic (rear) wings of Hymenoptera such as the honeybee. The hooks attach to a fold on the posterior edge of the mesothoracic (front) wings. It is less widely realised that similar hamuli, though usually fewer, are used in wing coupling in the Sternorrhyncha, the suborder of aphids and scale insects. In the Sternorrhyncha such wing coupling occurs particularly in the males of some species. The rear wings of that suborder frequently are reduced or absent, and in many species the last vestige of the rear wing to persist is a futile little strap holding the hamuli, still hooking into the fold of the large front wings. In those Springtails (Collembola) that have a functional furcula, the underside of the third abdominal segment bears a hooked structure, variously called the retinaculum or hamula. It holds the furcula ready for release in times of emergency. The terms also are used in descriptive anatomy of some insect genitalia, such as hamuli in various Odonata and \\"hamus\\" for the hooked part of the uncus in male Lepidoptera. Botany In botany such words largely refer to hooked bristles such as the hooks on the rachilla of Uncinia, which attach the fruit to passing animals, or the similarly functioning hooks on Burdocks, well known as the alleged inspiration for Velcro.

In 2002, he released his album, Glassi Khadke; it was a hit and the popular song on this album was Mashooq. Dhillon made his career with his third album, College, in 2003. The most popular song on the album was \\"Kalli Kite Mil\\". Though this was not a fast-paced tune, the album was redone later for an international release and the song was converted to a hardcore Bhangra, fast-paced song. \\"Kalli Kite Mil Kujh Kahengi Ta Nahi\\" made Dhillon widely popular. He later released Velli in 2005. The album was enjoyed internationally and nothing had to be changed to appeal to the international crowd. The album Velli is also believed to be his most successful album, which is believed to have sold over four hundred thousand copies worldwide. Most of the lyrics he sang for the albums were by Balvir Boparai, who is famous for his album Hostel.

In the game, the player guides Cuthbert through levels of girders, avoiding 'moronians' fatal to the touch. The gameplay is basically that of Space Panic: Cuthbert kills moronians by digging holes and causing them to fall down. On later levels, different coloured moronians are harder to kill and must be knocked through two platforms. Cuthbert also battles a time limit on each level, represented by an amount of oxygen remaining. Cuthbert's ability to dig holes can also be used to quickly drop to a lower platform without the use of a ladder.

At the 2001 Census Blackness was reported as having a population of around 135 residents. History The village originally served as a port for nearby Linlithgow, which was a principal residence of the Scottish monarchs from as early as the 12th century. As a port, Blackness was later superseded by Bo'ness, and fell into decline from the 17th century. Blackness Yacht Club currently use the village as a base for its sailing activities. Blackness Castle The small village is dominated by Blackness Castle, situated on a promontory overlooking the bay. The castle was both a residence and a prison before passing to Crown ownership in 1453. The castle is currently under the care of Historic Scotland and has been used as a setting for several films including Hamlet,Scotland: the Movie Location Guide - Hamlet - Blackness Castle, www.scotlandthemovie.com. and the BBC production of Ivanhoe.Visit Scotland - Blackness Castle , guide.visitscotland.com.

It lies on the rivers Wertach and Singold, on the edge of the Augsburg-Westliche W√§lder Nature Park, in Augsburg District, some 13 km south of Augsburg itself.  History  The placename \\"Bobingen\\" goes back to the Alamannic settler \\"Pobo\\" (ca 506). About 993, Bobingen was called \\"Pobinga\\" (\\"at Pobo's people's house\\"). Also about 993 came Bobingen's first documentary mention in the Vita S. Udalrici. Bobingen in today's administrative region of Swabia was later an administrative centre of the Augsburg Church Estate. As a result of the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803, the city came under Bavarian sovereignty. In 1847, the railway arrived, joining Bobingen to Lindau and Hof. In 1899, the rayon factory was founded, starting production in 1902. In 1953, the town was raised to market town, and in 1969 to city. In 1972, the communities of Stra√überg, Reinhartshausen and Burgwalden were amalgamated into Bobingen. Bobingen now belongs to the Augsburg district. In 1975, the communities of Waldberg and Kreuzanger were also amalgamated into Bobingen. In 1993, the city hall (Singoldhalle) was completed. In 1994, the city held a thousandth-anniversary celebration, as well as celebrating 25 years as a city. In 2004, the city saw the completion of the rehabilitation and expansion of the city hospital. In 2005, the city's buildings underwent beautification.  The Bobingen \\"B√ºble\\" Legend  There is more than one version of the story about the Bobingen B√ºble (\\"lad\\" or \\"young man\\"). In a second, later version, the story even ends with the characters' arrest and execution. This, however, cannot be true from an historical point of view, as there were no gallows in Bobingen, and therefore no hangings could be carried out. The Church Estate's High Justice establishment had its execution place at Schwabm√ºnchen. The following legend is the earliest version, drawn from Alexander Sch√∂ppner's \\"Bayerische Sagen\\" (Bavarian Legends): :Three hours south of Augsburg on the so-called Hochstra√üe (a \\"high road\\", built on embankments or viaducts), lies the great and beautiful village of Bobingen. There, however, it is not good to ask \\"Wo geht's Bobingen zu?\\" (\\"How does one get to Bobingen\\"), and quite a few have ended up with bloody heads from it. At the least one will be mauled with insult and scoffing, and with blasphemous talk, whomever one wishes to ask. This came about as follows: Once, a long time ago, there was a young man from Bobingen who was prosecuted before a court. The accused appealed to a lawyer with a good name in Augsburg to fight his case for him. He advised the young man to behave like an idiot before the court, to answer every question asked of him by saying \\"Bobingen zu\\" (which is rather nonsensical), at the same time pointing with his right hand under his nose from right to left. He did just as he was advised, and since neither a confession nor anything else could be got out of him, the court released him. After a time, he came to the town on business and met the lawyer, who was curious to know the case's outcome. After hearing of the fortunate success, he said \\"It is now time for you to pay me for this advice; I demand two Karolins for my troubles.\\" :The young man, however, replied with a \\"Bobingen zu\\", turned round the street corner and since that time has left the lawyer waiting for his fee.

Places on the 25-seat city council are apportioned as follows (as of municipal elections in 2014):https://www.stadt- bobingen.de/Mandatstraeger.n311.html * SPD: 10 seats * CSU: 9 seats * \\"Free Voters\\" (non-aligned citizens' group): 2 seat * Free Citizens' Union: 2 seat * Greens: 2 seat  Coat of arms  Arms description: Azure a peak argent, therein a horseshoe sable. Arms history: The meaning of the horseshoe in the municipal coat of arms is not entirely clear. The horseshoe could to some be a reminder of a once intensive horse raising industry in the town. Others see in it a reference to finding horseshoes ‚Äì which happens often around Bobingen ‚Äì which are called \\"Ungarneisen\\" (\\"Hungary irons\\"). They supposedly date from the Battle of Lechfeld (10 August 955) in which the Hungarians were defeated. A seal from the time around 1815 with a horseshoe in the shield has its roots in a local emblem that places along the so-called Hochstra√üe, following then Prince-Bishop Clemens Wenzeslaus von Sachsen's (1739‚Äì1812) wishes, assumed for marking border stones, border posts, and even posts around pastures. After the national emblem was bestowed by King Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1837, the municipal arms bore the Bavarian national colours overlaid with the black horseshoe.

The formerly municipal hospital belongs since 2006, together with the hospital of Schwabm√ºnchen, to the Komunalunternehmen (city owned company) Wertachkliniken (wertach hospitals), owned by the cities Bobingen and Schwabm√ºnchen. The official name is Wertachklinik (Wertach Hospital) Bobingen. The Wertachklinik Bobingen provides the main departments anaesthesiology, trauma and reconstructive surgery and internal medicine and the departments gynaecology and midwifery, ENT and plastic surgery with attending doctors. All departments together provide 130 beds. The first hospital in Bobingen was founded in 1858.  Public safety *Police The police station of Bobingen is located at the Hochstra√üe (high street) 22 in Bobingen. The area of responsibility is the town of Bobingen, the town of K√∂nigsbrunn, Oberottmarshausen and Wehringen. *Rescue service The rescue station of the Bavarian Red Cross is located at the Krumbacher Stra√üe 4A in Bobingen. Here a rescue ambulance and a patient transport ambulance are stationed. There is no fixed area of responsibility for the rescue service. The Public-safety answering point (PSAP) of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the rescue service. The PSAP is always alerting the closest rescue vehicle to an emergency. Administrative borders like counties etc. do not matter here. The area of operation is about the south of Augsburg County and the town of Augsburg itself. *Fire brigade The fire station of the volunteer fire brigade of Bobingen is located at Michael-Sch√§ffer-Stra√üe 12 in Bobingen. Here a L√∂schzug (platoon for fire fighting) and a R√ºstzug (platoon for technical relief, e.g. traffic collisions) are stationed. The PSAP of Augsburg is responsible for alerting the fire brigade, also. Therefore there is no fixed area of responsibility for the fire brigade. The area of operation is about the town of Bobingen itself and the district Siedlung and for support all other districts of Bobingen and the town of K√∂nigsbrunn, Oberottmarshausen, Wehringen und Gro√üaitingen.

Early life and education Hazen was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Samuel Edgar and Emma (Graff) Werner. Hazen married Catherine Stewart, 22 May 1924. They had a daughter, Joy Ann, and a son, Stewart Hazen. Hazen earned the A.B. degree from Albion College in 1920. He was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. Hazen then attended Columbia University, and earned the B.D. degree from Drew Theological Seminary in 1923. Career Ordained and Academic Ministry He was ordained to the ministry of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1924. He served the following pastoral appointments in Michigan: Westlawn and Cass Ave. M.E. Churches in Detroit and the Court Street Methodist Church in Flint. At these downtown Detroit churches he first developed what he called a Personal Trouble Clinic. This clinic was developed and operated in collaboration with a psychiatrist and a family visitor, and in co-operation with the Public Health Department, the Police Department, a Medical Center, and other public agencies. Much of his subsequent writing was drawn from his experiences in that work. Rev. Werner was lastly appointed Pastor of the Grace Methodist Church located at 1029 Harvard Blvd., Dayton, Ohio. In 1945 Werner became the Professor of Practical Theology at Drew Theological Seminary, Madison, New Jersey. There he taught seminary students the principles of counseling and the basic truths of the emotional life. He also contributed articles on counseling and personal problems to leading religious magazines of his day. The Rev. Dr. Werner was elected a delegate to General and Jurisdictional Conferences of The Methodist Church, 1944-48. He also was the Chairman of the General Commission on World Peace and a New world order, and was a member of the General Commission of Evangelism and the State of the Church, both of the Methodist Church. Warner was married to the former Helen Elsea and had a son, Stewart. Episcopal ministry Upon his election as a Bishop he was assigned to the Ohio Episcopal Area, where he served as Resident Bishop from 1948 to 1964. From 1964 until his retirement in 1968 he was based in Manhattan as bishop of the church for Hong Kong and Taiwan. Bishop Werner was a Mason and a member of Kiwanis. He enjoyed horseback riding as a leisure activity. He died of heart failure at his Saint Petersburg, Florida home.

The common term for the Jewish community of Ottoman Syria during the 19th century, and British Palestine prior to the establishment of the State of Israel is Yishuv (\\"settlement\\"). A distinction is drawn between the \\"New Yishuv\\", largely composed of and descended from immigrants after the First Aliyah in 1881, and the \\"Old Yishuv\\", the pre-existing Jewish community of Palestine prior to the First Aliyah. In addition to applying to Jews who lived in Palestine during the British Mandate era, the term \\"Palestinian Jews\\" has also been applied to Jewish residents of Southern Syria, the southern part of the Ottoman province of Syria, and there are scholarly instances of referring to the Jews of the Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Secunda provinces (4th to 7th centuries CE) of the Byzantine Empire in Late Antiquity as \\"Palestinian Jews\\". After the establishment of Israel in 1948, the Jews of Mandatory Palestine became Israeli citizens, and the term \\"Palestinian Jews\\" has largely fallen into disuse and is somewhat defunct, in favor of the term Israeli Jews. Historical overview Palestinian rabbi Raphael Chayyim Isaac Carregal Prior to dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, the population of the area comprising modern Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip was not exclusively Muslim. Under the Empire's rule in the mid-16th century, there were no more than 10,000 Jews in Palestine, making up around 5% of the population. By the mid-19th century, Turkish sources recorded that 80% of the population of 600,000 was identified as Muslim, 10% as Christian Arab and 5‚Äì7% as Jewish. The situation of the Jewish community in Palestine was more complicated than in neighbouring Arab countries. Whereas in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, communities were largely homogeneous in ethnic and confessional terms, in Palestine in the 19th century, Jewish pilgrims and European Christian colonial projects attracted large numbers of Ashkenazi immigrants from Eastern Europe and Sephardic groups from Bulgaria, Turkey and North Africa. The Jews of Palestine were not exclusively of Iberian origins, and included substantial Yiddish speaking communities who had established themselves in Palestine centuries earlier. Workers in Kerem Avraham neighborhood of Jerusalem (between 1852 and 1862) Jews in 'Ben Zakai' house of prayer, Jerusalem, 1893. Jews of Jerusalem, 1895. Jews of Peki'in, c. 1930 Towards the end of the Ottoman era in Palestine, native Jewish communities lived primarily in the four 'holy cities' of Safed, Tiberias, Hebron and Jerusalem. The Jewish population consisted of Ashkenazim (Judeo-German speakers) and Sephardim, the latter of which could be further subdivided as Sephardim proper (Judeo-Spanish speakers) and Maghrebim (North African Arabic speakers) or Mizrahim (Middle Eastern Jews, comparable to the Arabic term \\"Mashriqiyyun\\", or Easterners). The majority of Jews in the four holy cities, with the exception of Jerusalem, were Arabic and Judaeo-Spanish speakers. The dominant language among Jews in Jerusalem was Yiddish, due to the large migration of pious Ashkenazi Jews from Russia and Eastern Europe. Still, in 1882, there were 7,620 Sephardim in Jerusalem, of whom 1,290 were Maghrebim, from the Maghreb or North Africa. Natives of the city, they were Turkish subjects, and fluent in Arabic. Arabic also served as the lingua franca between the Sephradim/Mizrahim/Maghrebim and Ashkenazim and their non-Jewish Arab counterparts in mixed cities like Safed and Hebron. However, during the Greek and Roman period, the primary language of Palestinian Jews was Aramaic, a Semitic language closely related to Hebrew.E.P. Sanders, Jaroslav Jan Pelikan (2015). Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus In the narrative works of Arabs in Palestine in the late Ottoman period, as evidenced in the autobiographies and diaries of Khalil al-Sakakini and Wasif Jawhariyyeh, \\"native\\" Jews were often referred to and described as abnaa al-balad (sons of the country), 'compatriots', or Yahud awlad Arab (Jews, sons of Arabs). When the First Palestinian Congress of February 1919 issued its anti-Zionist manifesto rejecting Zionist immigration, it extended a welcome to those Jews \\"among us who have been Arabicized, who have been living in our province since before the war; they are as we are, and their loyalties are our own.\\" Reference to European Jews as \\"Palestinians\\" prior to 1948 European Jews were commonly considered an \\"Oriental\\" people in many of their host countries, usually as reference to their ancestral origins in the Middle East. A prominent example of this is Immanuel Kant, an 18th-century Prussian philosopher who referred to European Jews as \\"Palestinians living among us.\\"Kant, Immanuel (1974): Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. Translated by Mary J. Gregor. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, cited in Chad Alan Goldberg, Politicide Revisited. University of Wisconsin-Madison Naming of \\"Israel\\" in Arabic Official documents released in April 2013 by the State Archive of Israel show that days before the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948, Jewish officials were still debating about what the new country would be called in Arabic: Palestine (Filastin), Zion (Sahyoun) or Israel (Isra‚Äôil). Two assumptions were made: \\"That an Arab state was about to be established alongside the Jewish one in keeping with the UN‚Äôs partition resolution the year before, and that the Jewish state would include a large Arab minority whose feelings needed to be taken into account\\". In the end, the officials rejected the name Palestine because they thought that would be the name of the new Arab state and could cause confusion so they opted for the most straightforward option: Israel. Dispute over usage of the term \\"Palestinian Jew\\" PLO usage The Palestinian National Charter, as amended by the PLO's Palestinian National Council in July 1968, defined \\"Palestinians\\" as \\"those Arab nationals who, until 1947, normally resided in Palestine regardless of whether they were evicted from it or stayed there. Anyone born, after that date, of a Palestinian father‚Äîwhether in Palestine or outside it‚Äîis also a Palestinian. The Jews who had normally resided in Palestine until the beginning of the Zionist invasion will be considered Palestinians.\\" Israeli usage Yaakov Meir (born in 1856 in Jerusalem), the first Sephardic Chief Rabbi appointed in Mandatory Palestine, preferred not to use the term \\"Palestinian Jew\\" due to his Zionist affiliations. He spoke fluent Hebrew and encouraged the construction of new Jewish quarters of Jerusalem as well as the re- establishment of an Independent Israeli Jewish State. Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel (Born in 1880 in Jerusalem), was the Sephardi chief rabbi of Mandatory Palestine from 1939 to 1948, and of Israel from 1948 to 1954. He served as a Mizrahi delegate to the Zionist Congress from 1925‚Äì46. As a religious Zionist, he strongly believed in the redemption of Israel and bringing the Jewish exiles back to the land to create a religious Jewish state of Israel. As a strong supporter of Israeli nationalism, in his writing The Redemption of Israel he wrote: \\"We all desire that the in gathering of the exiles should take place from all areas where they have been scattered; and that our holy language will be upon our lips and upon the lips of our children, in building the Land and its flowering through the hands and work of Israel; and we will all strive to see the flag of freedom and redemption waving in glory and strength upon the walls of Jerusalem.\\" Mordechai Eliyahu (Born in Jerusalem 3 March 1929 ‚Äì 7 June 2010) was a prominent rabbi, posek and spiritual leader. He served as the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1983 to 1993. Because Eliyahu was one of the spiritual leaders of the Religious Zionist movement he refused to use the term \\"Palestinian\\" and believed all Jews should refrain from using the term. He was an outspoken opponent of the Gaza Disengagement of 2005 and supported Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank (Judea and Samaria). He was considered somewhat controversial for his decades-long support of the radical right of the Religious Zionist movement. Eliyahu was a friend of Rabbi Meir Kahane and his family. Uri Davis, an Israeli citizen, academic, activist and observer-member in the Palestinian National Council living in the Arab town of Sakhnin, identified himself as an \\"anti-Zionist Palestinian Hebrew\\". Davis explained, \\"I don‚Äôt describe myself as a Palestinian Hebrew, but I actually happen to be a Palestinian Hebrew, I was born in Jerusalem in 1943 in a country called Palestine and the title of my birth certificate is 'Government of Palestine'. That is neither here nor there, though. It is significant only in a political context in which I am situated, and the political context that is relevant to my work, my advocacy of a critique of Zionism. I'm an anti-Zionist.\\" He has since converted to Islam in 2008 to marry a Palestinian Muslim woman Miyassar Abu Ali whom he met in 2006. Since then he no longer considers himself Jewish. Tali Fahima, an Israeli pro-Palestinian activist, describes her nationality as Palestinian. Fahima was born in Kiryat Gat, a development town in the south of Israel, to a family of Algerian Jewish origin. Fahima lives in the Arab village Ar'ara in northern Israel, and works as a Hebrew teacher. In June 2010, it was reported that she converted to Islam at a mosque in Umm al-Fahm. The actor, director and activist Juliano Mer-Khamis, the son of an Israeli Jewish mother and a Palestinian father, described himself in a 2009 interview with Israel Army Radio as \\"100 percent Palestinian Arab and 100 percent Jewish\\".

Early life Morris was born in London, England. He spent his childhood in rural Somerset before the family moved to the United States, where he attended the progressive Putney School in Vermont. There his precocious talent for painting, inspired by the surrealists in New York, was given full rein. On his return to the UK in 1947, after completion of National Service in the army and spells at art schools in London (Anglo-French Art Centre) and Paris (L'Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re), he finished his art education at the Royal Academy Schools. Career Adrian Morris's 1978 presentation in the Hayward Annual in London Although a dedicated painter all his life, Morris was reserved in showing his work, but over the years from the mid-'50s he did exhibit at a number of leading London galleries, including the Leicester, St. George's and the Hanover. The Hayward Gallery showed sixteen of his works in their Annual '78, alongside artists including Mary Kelly, Liliane Lijn, Rita Donagh, Elisabeth Frink and Marc Camille Chaimowicz. He sketched ideas for paintings at every opportunity, especially when he was away from his studio, teaching. Dominating themes were the earth, its vulnerability to both natural and man-made disasters and the effect on its inhabitants. Morris was inspired in the 1960s by the NASA space exploration programme and the views of distant, barren terrain seen through a spacecraft hatch. Although figures, such as astronauts, refugees, wounded soldiers and poor rural workers, feature strongly in preliminary sketches, they seldom survive into the finished works - as William Packer observed in The Times, the figures had gone \\"leaving a space or structure in which a figure indeed might be, but as an implicit presence\\". These, typically, are painted in oil on gessoed panels, which are pared down to the minimum, every square inch minutely considered. Selected exhibitions The Redfern Gallery, London staged a retrospective of Morris‚Äôs work in May/June, 2008 and a further one-man show, focussing on his drawings, was held at the gallery in June/July, 2010. His work was included in several group shows at the Redfern, including Aspects of Landscape in 2014. In the following years his work was rediscovered and championed by younger generations of artists. New Foundations, a one-man show of paintings was held at 42 Carlton Place, Glasgow in September/October 2015. A two-person show, with Carol Rhodes, was mounted in Balfron Tower, London in May, 2016. A solo show was held at 3236RLS Le Bourgeois, London in November/ December 2018. In March/April 2019 a major solo exhibition of Morris was held in Galerie Neu, Berlin and his work was included in their Art Basel presentation of that year. In March 2020 a solo exhibition of Morris‚Äôs work opened at Essex Street gallery in New York. The exhibition was closed due to the Covid19 pandemic and reopened in July for a final week.  Website  The Estate of Adrian Morris created the website adrianmorris.info in July 2020.  Critical reception  * \\"Morris's work speaks directly of the anxieties and hopes we now harbour about our planet's state in the 21st century. There is an impressive level of consistency and rigour running through his mature output. It amounts to a formidable corpus of work. The paintings' austere, hard-won and, above all precient eloquence deserves to be recognised today\\". *\\"The images are tense and still, the paint rubbed into the gesso, layer on layer until it seems to become the material it depicts, metal and sand, amplifying the disquiet...Morris's imagery leads us to infer a somehow sacrosanct 'humanist' or 'existential' content. *\\"Adrian Morris was one who understood that interesting painting must be at once concrete and mimetic, a matter of both surface and survey. His signature device of a visual aperture or hatch opening onto flat planes (plains) asserts that painting‚Äîpace formalist dogma‚Äîis always a window onto a world of illusions. Yet it also reiterates artifice, the presence of the painted panel itself. A compacted, burnished impasto fuses the frame with what is within and beyond. The terrain depicted is synonymous with the painting ‚Äúground.‚Äù *\\"The paintings in their emptiness emanate light. They are pared back, unpopulated by people, with a stillness that seems to express a deep sense of geological time.

He founded the London-based record label Charisma Records in 1969 and managed rock groups such as the Nice, Van der Graaf Generator and Genesis. Career Stratton-Smith was born in Birmingham. He started his career as a sports journalist, mainly reporting on football for the Daily Sketch and the Daily Express, and while at the Express including being assigned to cover the Manchester United v Red Star Belgrade European Cup match in Yugoslavia. However their chief soccer correspondent Henry Rose pulled rank and decided to go instead. The aircraft bringing back the team, officials and press crashed in what became known as the Munich Air Disaster and Rose was one of the fatalities. Later on he began being influenced by The Beatles, in particular their manager Brian Epstein and decided to enter the music business. One of the earliest bands he managed were the Liverpool-based The Koobas, taking over from Epstein. He subsequently took over management of The Nice in 1968 from Andrew Loog Oldham and, frustrated with the workings of Oldham's Immediate Records label, decided to form his own. Later signings included the Bonzo Dog Band and Van der Graaf Generator. In 1969 he signed the progressive rock band Genesis onto his record and management companies, and released Trespass (1970), the band's second album. Genesis became the label's most commercially successful group. Stratton-Smith released many records by Monty Python and helped to finance the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). He also recorded former Bonzo frontman Vivian Stanshall and financed Stanshall's film Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (1980), as well as being credited as its producer. Other important artists Stratton-Smith was closely associated with include Atomic Rooster, Audience, Brand X, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Peter Hammill, Lindisfarne, Julian Lennon, Robert John Godfrey, String Driven Thing and Rare Bird. According to Hackett, Stratton-Smith missed an opportunity to sign Queen, whose demos had been brought in to Charisma. Gail Colson worked with him at Charisma, as label manager and joint managing director. She left to form her own company in the late 1970s and would manage the solo careers of Gabriel and Hammill, among others. In the United States, Charisma Records recordings were often licensed to other labels such as ABC Records (including subsidiary labels Dunhill Records & Probe Records), Elektra Records, Buddah Records, Atlantic Records, Mercury Records and Arista Records. The label was eventually sold to Virgin Records in 1983. Virgin re-activated the Charisma name with a new logo for a short time during the late 1980s. The vast majority of the Charisma catalogue is now owned by EMI. \\"Strat\\" as he was known to his friends was known for his sense of humour and flair for promotion. His sense of humour was often reflected in promotional materials and record label art. With an ear for unusual and creative talent he made Charisma successful, especially in its early years. Though usually known as \\"Charisma Records\\", the company also promoted itself as \\"The Famous Charisma Label\\". Death Stratton-Smith died of pancreatic cancer on 19 March 1987 aged 53. A memorial service was held for him at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Marillion's album Clutching at Straws (released shortly after his death in 1987) was dedicated to him in the sleeve credits.

Two Spanish plantation owners, Don Jos√© Ruiz and Don Pedro Montes, bought 53 captives (including four children) in Havana, Cuba and were transporting them on the ship to their plantations near Puerto Pr√≠ncipe (modern Camag√ºey, Cuba). The revolt began after the schooner's cook jokingly told the slaves that they were to be \\"killed, salted, and cooked\\". Sengbe Pieh, a Mende man, also known as Joseph Cinqu√©, unshackled himself and the others on the third day and started the revolt. They took control of the ship, killing the captain and the cook. In the melee, three Africans were also killed. Pieh ordered Ruiz and Montes to sail to Africa. Instead, Ruiz and Montes sailed north, up the east coast of the United States, sure that the ship would be intercepted and the Africans returned to Cuba as slaves. A US ship, the revenue cutter Washington, seized Amistad off Montauk Point in Long Island, New York. Pieh and his group escaped the ship but were caught off shore by citizens. They were incarcerated in New Haven, Connecticut, on charges of murder and piracy. The man who captured Pieh and his group claimed them as property. La Amistad was towed to New London, Connecticut, and those remaining on the ship were arrested. None of the 43 survivors on the ship spoke English so they couldn't explain what had taken place. Eventually language professor Josiah Gibbs found an interpreter, James Covey, and learned of the abduction. Two lawsuits were filed. The first case was brought by the Washington ship officers over property claims and the second case was the Spanish being charged with enslaving Africans. Spain requested President Martin Van Buren to return the African captives to Cuba under international treaty. Because of issues of ownership and jurisdiction, the case gained international attention. Known as United States v. The Amistad (1841), the case was finally decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in favor of the Mende, restoring their freedom. It became a symbol in the United States in the movement to abolish slavery. Description La Amistad was a 19th-century two-masted schooner of about . In 1839 it was owned by Ram√≥n Ferrer, a Spanish national. Strictly speaking, La Amistad was not a slave ship, as it was not designed to transport large cargoes of slaves, nor did it engage in the Middle Passage of Africans to the Americas. The ship engaged in the shorter, domestic coastwise trade around Cuba and islands and coastal nations in the Caribbean. The primary cargo carried by La Amistad was sugar-industry products. It carried a limited number of passengers and, on occasion, slaves being transported for delivery or sale around the island. 1839 slave revolt 1840 engraving depicting the Amistad revolt Captained by Ferrer, La Amistad left Havana on June 28, 1839, for the small port of Guanaja, near Puerto Pr√≠ncipe, Cuba, with some general cargo and 53 Africans slaves bound for the sugar plantation where they were to be delivered. These 53 Mende captives (49 adults and four children) had been taken from Mendiland (in modern-day Sierra Leone) and illegally transported from Africa to Havana, mostly aboard the slave ship Te√ßora, to be sold into slavery in Cuba. Although the United States and Britain had banned the Atlantic slave trade, Spain had not abolished slavery in its colonies. The crew of La Amistad, lacking purpose-built slave quarters, placed half the captives in the main hold and the other half on deck. The captives were relatively free to move about, which aided their revolt and commandeering of the vessel. In the main hold below decks, the captives found a rusty file and sawed through their manacles. On about July 1, once free, the men below quickly went up on deck. Armed with machete-like cane knives, they attacked the crew, successfully gaining control of the ship, under the leadership of Sengbe Pieh (later known in the United States as Joseph Cinqu√©). They killed the captain and some of the crew, but spared Jos√© Ruiz and Pedro Montes, the two owners of the slaves, so that they could guide the ship back to Africa. While the Mende demanded to be returned home, the navigator Montes deceived them about the course, maneuvering the ship north along the North American coast until they reached the eastern tip of Long Island, New York. Discovered by the naval brig while on surveying duties, La Amistad was taken into United States custody.Between 1838 and 1848, the USRC Washington was transferred from the United States Revenue Cutter Service to the US Navy. See: Howard I. Chapelle, The History of the American Sailing Navy. New York: Norton / Bonanza Books (1949), Court case The Washington officers brought the first case to federal district court over salvage claims while the second case began in a Connecticut court after the state arrested the Spanish traders on charges of enslaving free Africans. The Spanish foreign minister, however, demanded that Amistad and its cargo be released from custody and the \\"slaves\\" sent to Cuba for punishment by Spanish authorities. While the Van Buren administration accepted the Spanish crown's argument, Secretary of State John Forsyth explained that the president could not order the release of Amistad and its cargo because the executive could not interfere with the judiciary under American law. He could also not release the Spanish traders from imprisonment in Connecticut because that would constitute federal intervention in a matter of state jurisdiction. Abolitionists Joshua Leavitt, Lewis Tappan, and Simeon Jocelyn formed the Amistad Committee to raise funds for the defense of Amistad's captives. Former President John Quincy Adams represented the captives in court. The Sun on August 31, 1839 Text of the Amistad Supreme Court decision A widely-publicized court case ensued in New Haven to settle legal issues about the ship and the status of the Mende captives. They were at risk of execution if convicted of mutiny. They became a popular cause among abolitionists in the United States. Since 1808, the United States and Britain had prohibited the international slave trade. In order to avoid the international prohibition on the African slave trade, the ship's owners fraudulently described the Mende as having been born in Cuba and said they were being sold in the Spanish domestic slave trade. The court had to determine if the Mende were to be considered salvage and thus the property of naval officers who had taken custody of the ship (as was legal in such cases), the property of the Cuban buyers, or the property of Spain, as Queen Isabella II claimed, via Spanish ownership of the Amistad. A question was whether the circumstances of the capture and transport of the Mende meant they were legally free and had acted as free men rather than slaves. After judges ruled in favor of the Africans in the district and circuit courts, the United States v. The Amistad case reached the US Supreme Court on appeal. In 1841, it ruled that the Mende had been illegally transported and held as slaves, and had rebelled in self-defense. It ordered them freed. Although the US government did not provide any aid, thirty-five survivors returned to Africa in 1842, aided by funds raised by the United Missionary Society, a black group founded by James W.C. Pennington. He was a Congregational minister and fugitive slave in Brooklyn, New York, who was active in the abolitionist movement.Webber, Christopher L. (2011). American to the Backbone: The Life of James W.C. Pennington, the Fugitive Slave Who Became One of the First Black Abolitionists. New York: Pegasus Books. , pp. 162‚Äì169. The Spanish government claimed that the slaves were Spanish citizens not of African origin. This created a lot of tension between the US government, the British, who had already abolished slavery and had made this act illegal, and the Spanish government. Later years After being moored at the wharf behind the US Custom House in New London, Connecticut, for a year and a half, La Amistad was auctioned off by the U.S. Marshal in October 1840. Captain George Hawford, of Newport, Rhode Island, purchased the vessel and then needed an Act of Congress passed to register it. He renamed it Ion. In late 1841, he sailed Ion to Bermuda and Saint Thomas with a typical New England cargo of onions, apples, live poultry, and cheese. After sailing Ion for a few years, Hawford sold it in Guadeloupe in 1844. There is no record of what became of Ion under the new French owners in the Caribbean. LegacyThe Amistad Memorial stands in front of New Haven City Hall and County Courthouse in New Haven, Connecticut, where many of the events related to the affair in the United States occurred. The Amistad Research Center at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, is devoted to research about slavery, abolition, civil rights and African Americans; it commemorates the revolt of slaves on the ship by the same name. A collection of portraits of La Amistad survivors that were drawn by William H. Townsend during the survivors' trial are held in the collection of Yale University. Replica Between 1998 and 2000, artisans at Mystic Seaport, Mystic, Connecticut, built a replica of La Amistad, using traditional skills and construction techniques common to wooden schooners built in the 19th century, but using modern materials and engines. Officially named Amistad, it was promoted as \\"Freedom Schooner Amistad\\". The modern-day ship is not an exact replica of La Amistad, as it is slightly longer and has higher freeboard. There were no old blueprints of the original. The new schooner was built using a general knowledge of the Baltimore Clippers and art drawings from the era. Some of the tools used in the project were the same as those that might have been used by a 19th-century shipwright, while others were powered. Tri-Coastal Marine, designers of \\"Freedom Schooner Amistad\\", used modern computer technology to develop plans for the vessel. Bronze bolts are used as fastenings throughout the ship. Freedom Schooner Amistad has an external ballast keel made of lead and two Caterpillar diesel engines. None of this technology was available to 19th-century builders. \\"Freedom Schooner Amistad\\" was operated by Amistad America, Inc., based in New Haven, Connecticut. The ship's mission was to educate the public on the history of slavery, abolition, discrimination, and civil rights. The homeport is New Haven, where the Amistad trial took place. It has also traveled to port cities for educational opportunities. It was also the State Flagship and Tall ship Ambassador of Connecticut. The ship made several commemorative voyages: one in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade in Britain (1807) and the United States (1808), and one in 2010 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its 2000 launching at Mystic Seaport. It undertook a two-year refit at Mystic Seaport from 2010 and was subsequently mainly used for sea training in Maine and film work. In 2013 Amistad America lost its non-profit organization status after failing to file tax returns for three years and amid concern of the accountability for public funding from the state of Connecticut. The company was later put into liquidation, and in November 2015 a new non-profit, Discovering Amistad Inc., purchased the ship from the receiver. Amistad has now been restored to educational and promotional activity in New Haven, Connecticut.  In popular culture  *On 2 September 1839, a play entitled The Long, Low Black Schooner, based on the revolt, opened in New York City and played to full houses. (La Amistad was painted black at the time of the revolt.) *The slave revolt aboard the La Amistad, the background of the slave trade, and its subsequent trial are retold in a celebrated poem by Robert Hayden entitled Middle Passage, first published in 1962. * In Robert Skimin's novel Gray Victory (1988), depicting an alternate history in which the South won the American Civil War, a group of abolitionist conspirators infiltrating Richmond, Virginia calls itself \\"Amistad\\". *The film Amistad (1997), directed by Steven Spielberg, dramatized the historical incidents. Major actors were Morgan Freeman, as a freed slave- turned-abolitionist in New Haven; Anthony Hopkins, as John Quincy Adams; Matthew McConaughey, as Roger Sherman Baldwin, an unorthodox, but influential lawyer; and Djimon Hounsou, as Cinque (Sengbe Peah). * The 1999 hit single \\"My Love Is Your Love\\", performed by Whitney Houston, references the \\"chains of Amistad\\". *In January 2011, Random House published Ardency, a collection of poems written over 20 years by American poet Kevin Young which \\"gathers here a chorus of voices that tells the story of the Africans who mutinied on board the slave ship Amistad\\".

The island is on the American side of the river, adjacent to the St. Lawrence Seaway channel in Northern New York. It is a part of the Town of Alexandria, in Jefferson County, New York. It is the only artificial island in the entire region. The original owner of the house was Hudson Rose, a New York City lumber dealer. The island was originally named Rossette after Rose. The home was bought in the mid-1920s by Temple Berdan, and was empty from 1932 to 1939. Lewis Dollinger purchased the home from Berdan's estate. It was later owned by the Dollinger Corporation and, after the tax laws were changed in the 1970s, was owned by the son of Dollinger Corporation founder Lewis Dollinger, F. Leslie Dollinger for many years. It was sold in 1994 to Arizona businessman Al Wareing, who is the current owner.  Construction  The construction drawings for Mr. and Mrs. Hudson P. Rose were provided by architects Barney and Chapman of New York and were approved on April 26, 1905. The first contract for materials was by the Otis Brooks Lumber Company of Clayton, New York and was signed on July 15, 1905. The May 3, 1905 edition of the Watertown Daily Times reported that Mr. & Mrs Hudson P. Rose were to have a home built on their property near point Vivian the following season. The home and boathouse that are situated on it were built in 1906. The island was constructed on four rock shoals, by building a rock wall around the shoals from a nearby quarry, then filling the area in with rock and soil. The construction was done by Barney & Chapman. See also: In the 1990s, construction was done to the boathouse to repair it, as the building was starting to fall into the river. New rock walls were placed in the building to stop the descent and the level of the island was raised by about by adding another level of rock, soil, and grass seed. The upstairs of the boathouse was also altered to include a full wet-bar, and deck space was located onto the roof. No alteration construction work may be done on the outside of the house, as it is registered on the National Register of Historic Places. Tour boat passing Longue Vue Island  Island layout  The island has an approximately house on the center. The boathouse, while smaller, has three boat slips, which have held as many as six boats over the years. The second floor includes a game room with wet bar. The flagpole (which was originally on the top of the house) is on the western tip of the island and has a plaque next to it noting the fact that the founder of Dollinger Corporation, Lewis Dollinger, died on the island. There is plenty of lawn space on the island, and swimming space, including a dock and a water slide. The three-story home includes a kitchen, small breakfast room, large living room, dining room, and large porch surrounding the house on two sides on the first floor. The second and third floors are mostly bedrooms and bathrooms. In addition to the four-sided open stairwell, the second floor is connected to the kitchen on the first floor via a small spiral stairway hidden behind a closet door, presumably intended for servant use. Within the basement of the house, one of the three shoals the island was built on can be seen sticking out of the floor and wall. The island is within a short boat ride of Boldt Castle, a castle constructed around 1900, left unfinished in 1904. The island also has a collection of flags which are flown at certain times during the summer. The flags are of all the different countries in the world. These flags are flown around the exterior of the island. In addition to the country flags, there is a flag for every state. These flags are on display during the Fourth of July weekend as well as Labor Day weekend.  Ghost stories about Longue Vue Island  The current owners of Longue Vue Island have declared that they have seen the ghost of Lewis Dollinger roaming the house at night time. The son of former owner Leslie Dollinger, Doug Dollinger, also has believed to have stated that he saw the painting of Lewis Dollinger that used to be in the dining room come alive at night time and tell him to get off the island back in the 1970s.

An arrangement exists for a march as well. Composition and initial success Well- established in their careers, composer Vasily Solovyov-Sedoi and poet Mikhail Matusovsky wrote the song in 1955 with the title \\"Leningradskie Vechera\\" (\\"Leningrad Nights\\"), but at the request of the Soviet Ministry of Culture, they changed the title to \\"–ü–æ–¥–º–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –≤–µ—á–µ—Ä–∞\\" (\\"Podmoskovnye Vechera,\\" literally, \\"Evenings in the Moscow Suburbs\\") and made corresponding changes to the lyrics. In 1956, \\"Podmoskovnye Vechera\\" was recorded by Vladimir Troshin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRFScbISKDg a young actor of the Moscow Art Theatre, for a scene in a documentary about the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic's athletic competition Spartakiad in which the athletes rest in Podmoskovye, the Moscow suburbs. The film did nothing to promote the song, but thanks to radio broadcasts it gained considerable popularity. In 1957, quite to the surprise of its creators, the song won both the first prize at the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Moscow and the international song contest. The song spread around the world, achieving particular popularity in mainland China; Van Cliburn's 1958 piano performance of the tune contributed to this international spread. Covers The British jazz group, Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen, had a hit with the song in 1961 under the title \\"Midnight in Moscow\\". This version peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in January 1962. \\"Midnight in Moscow\\" also reached number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in March that year,(kept out of the number one spot by, \\"Hey! Baby\\" by Bruce Channel),https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1962-03-17 while it spent three weeks at number one on the American Easy Listening chart. In 1962 at the height of the folk revival in the United States, the song was recorded by The Chad Mitchell Trio on their popular live performance album At the Bitter End on Kapp Records. The group introduced the song with its original Russian lyrics to the American mainstream audience during the Cold War era of strained relations between the U.S. and the USSR. Swedish pianist Jan Johansson recorded a jazzy version of the song. It was named \\"Kv√§llar i Moskvas F√∂rst√§der\\", literally \\"Evenings in Moscow's suburbs\\" and was released in 1967. In 1999 German heavy metal band U.D.O used Moscow Nights for the guitar solo in the song \\"Shout it Out\\" from the album Holy. A year later the Scorpions adapted it as an intro of the symphonic version of its song \\"Crossfire\\" - as part of the Deadly Sting Suite - on the Moment Of Glory album. The Chinese composer Gao Ping used the song in 2003 as the basis for one of his Soviet Love Songs for Vocalising Pianist, \\"Evenings in Suburban Moscow.\\" By his use, he was confirming the popularity of the song during the Communist era of China, a time when cultural exchanges between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China were particularly strong. A special piano version was used to accompany the ribbon routine of Russian rhythmic gymnast Evgeniya Kanaeva who became an Olympic champion at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. The Russian pop singer Vitas recorded a version of the song with his counter- tenor voice. He performed it at several Chinese festivals before its release in November 2010. on his compilation album Masterpieces of Three Centuries) The song was used in a folk style combined with Katyusha in a medley in 2012 by Uzbek rhythmic gymnast Ulyana Trofimova for her ball routine and in 2014 for Russian rhythmic gymnast Yana Kudryavtseva in her clubs routine. In 2015, the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, under the direction of Lieutenant General Valery Khalilov, performed a parade version of the song during the march past of foreign contingents (specifically those from Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan) in the Moscow Victory Day Parade that year. In June 2018, the English teenage composer Alma Deutscher adapted the song for piano to entertain Russian President Vladimir Putin during a State Visit to Austria, at the request of Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. Given three days to arrange it, Deutscher started with a sad lament that transformed itself into a Viennese waltz. Kurz explained that the melding of the two musical styles illustrated well the bond of friendship between Austria and Russia.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NmbOxo_Wx8. Deutscher repeated the arrangement as an encore during her recital at the Lucerne Festival on 29 August 2018. Place in Soviet culture In the Soviet Union, the tune became the time signal sounded every 30 minutes on the Mayak music and news radio station in 1964. The shortwave radio station Radio Moscow's English-language service has played an instrumental version of \\"Moscow Nights\\", between informing listeners of frequency changes and the hourly newscast since the start of its 24-hour English Service in 1978. In American popular culture The lyrics were shown on 9 March 2017, in Cyrillic script, as the vanity card of The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Escape Hatch Identification\\" (Season 10 Episode 18). And once again on 5 April 2018, as card number 585, but the second line of the song was missing.

The term \\"Cypro-Minoan\\" was coined by Arthur Evans in 1909 based on its visual similarity to Linear A on Minoan Crete, from which CM is thought to be derived. Approximately 250 objects‚Äîsuch as clay balls, cylinders, and tablets and votive stands‚Äîwhich bear Cypro-Minoan inscriptions, have been found. Discoveries have been made at various sites around Cyprus, as well as in the ancient city of Ugarit on the Syrian coast. Emergence Little is known about how this script originated or about the underlying language. However, its use continued into the early Iron Age, forming a link to the Cypriot syllabary, which has been deciphered as Greek. Arthur Evans considered the Cypro-Minoan syllabary to be a result of uninterrupted evolution of the Minoan Linear A script. He believed that the script was brought to Cyprus by Minoan colonizers or migrants. Evans' theory was uncritically supported until recently, when it was shown that the earliest Cypro-Minoan inscriptions were separated from the earliest texts in Linear A by less than a century, yet the Cypro-Minoan script at its earliest stage was substantially different from Linear A: it contained only syllabic signs while Linear A and its descendant Linear B both contained multiple ideograms, and its form was adapted to writing on clay while Linear A was better suited to writing with ink. The Linear B script that emerged a century later still retained many more features from, and most of the signary of, Linear A. All this evidence indicates a one-time introduction rather than long-time development.Ferrara, 2012, vol. 1 Varieties and periodization The earliest inscriptions are dated about 1550 BC. Although some scholars disagree with this classification, the inscriptions have been classified by Emilia Masson into four closely related groups: archaic CM, CM1 (also known as Linear C), CM2, and CM3, which she considered chronological stages of development of the writing. This classification was and is generally accepted, but in 2011 Silvia Ferrara contested its chronological nature based on the archaeological context. She pointed out that CM1, CM2, and CM3 all existed simultaneously, their texts demonstrated the same statistical and combinatorial regularities, and their character sets should have been basically the same; she also noted a strong correlation between these groups and the use of different writing materials. Only the archaic CM found in the earliest archaeological context is indeed distinct from these three.Ferrara, 2012, vol. 1 Spread and extinction The Cypro-Minoan script was absent in some Bronze Age cities of Cyprus, yet abundant in others. Unlike many other neighboring states, the Late Bronze Age collapse had only a slight impact on Bronze Age Cyprus; in fact, the island culture flourished in the period immediately following the dramatic events of the collapse, and there was a visible increase in the use of the script in such centers as Enkomi. On the other hand, as a direct result of this collapse, the script ceased to exist in Ugarit, along with Ugarit itself. After that point, the number of Greek artifacts gradually increased in the Cypriot context, and around 950 BC the Cypro-Minoan script suddenly disappears, being soon substituted by the new Cypriot syllabary, whose inscriptions represent mainly the Greek language, with just a few short texts in Eteocypriot. Language and cultural attribution As long as the script remains undeciphered (with only about 15‚Äì20 signs having clear parallels in cognate scripts), it can only be speculated whether the language was the same as Minoan or Eteocypriot, and whether these two were identical. However, Silvia Ferrara and A. Bernard Knapp noted that the name \\"Cypro-Minoan\\" (based on the origin of the script) is rather deceptive, as the archaeological context of Cyprus was largely different from that of Minoan Crete, even in spite of visible traces of trade with Crete in the archaeological context, as well as the common presence of Cypriot and Cretan writing in Ugarit. There were no visible traces of Minoan invasion, colonization, or even significant cultural influence in Bronze Age Cyprus. At that time, the island was part of the Near-East cultural circleFerrara, 2012, vol. 1 rather than Aegean civilizations. Based on the above-mentioned classification of the script into several varieties, Emilia Masson hypothesized that they may represent different languages that chronologically supplanted each other. Ferrara, while disproving Masson's hypothesis about these varieties as chronological stages, also indicated that the statistics of use of signs for all the varieties, as well as several noticeable combinations of signs, were the same for all the varieties, which may point to the same language rather than separate languages. Artifacts The earliest known CM inscription found in Europe was a clay tablet discovered in 1955 at the ancient site of Enkomi, near the east coast of Cyprus. It was dated to ca. 1500 BC, and bore three lines of writing. Other fragments of clay tablets have been found at Enkomi and Ugarit. Clay balls Dozens of small clay balls, each bearing 3‚Äì5 signs in CM1, have been uncovered at Enkomi and Kition. Cypro-Minoan clay ball in the Louvre. Clay cylinders Clay cylinder seals have been uncovered at Enkomi and Kalavassos- Ayios Dimitrios, some of which bear lengthy texts (more than 100 characters). It is likely that the balls and cylinder seals are related to the keeping of economic records on Minoan Cyprus, considering the large number of cross- references between the texts. Decipherment The extant corpus of Cypro- Minoan is not large enough to allow for the isolated use of a cryptographic solution to decipherment. Currently, the total number of signs on formal Cypro-Minoan inscriptions (approx. 2,500) compares unfavorably with the number known from the undeciphered Linear A documents (over 7,000) and the number available in Linear B when it was deciphered (approx. 30,000). Furthermore, different languages may have been represented by the same Cypro-Minoan subsystem, and without the discovery of bilingual texts or many more texts in each subsystem, decipherment is extremely unlikely. According to Thomas G. Palaima, \\"all past and current schemes of decipherment of Cypro-Minoan are improbable\\". Silvia Ferrara also believes this to be the case, as she concluded in her detailed analysis of the subject in 2012. Recent developments Several attempts to decipher the script (Ernst Sittig, V. Sergeev, Jan Best etc.) were rejected by specialists due to numerous inaccuracies. In 1998, Joanna S. Smith and Nicolle Hirschfeld received the 1998 Best of Show Poster Award at the annual meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America for their work on the Cypro-Minoan Corpus project, which aims to create a complete and accurate corpus of CM inscriptions, and archaeological and epigraphical discussions of all the evidence.CAARI News p. 5. Jean-Pierre Olivier issued an edition in 2007 of all the inscriptions available to him. Silvia Ferrara has prepared an even more comprehensive edition of the corpus as a companion volume to her analytic survey of 2012. In 2012‚Äì2013, Ferrara published two volumes of her research, where she studied the script in its archaeological context. She also largely used statistical and combinatoric methods to study the structure of large texts and to detect regularities in the use of the signs. Her work is interesting for substantiated contesting of several important hypotheses largely accepted before, namely related to the emergence, chronological classification, language and \\"non-Minoan\\" attribution of the texts.

History of construction The structure being built in the 1950s The structure was significant as the first new downtown skyscraper constructed in Chicago since the Field Building, 21 years earlier and was built on air rights over the Illinois Central Railroad. It was the last building ever connected to the Chicago Tunnel Company's tunnel network. When the Prudential was finished it had the highest roof in Chicago with only the statue of Ceres on the Chicago Board of Trade higher. Its mast served as a broadcasting antenna for Chicago's WGN-TV. The architect was Naess & Murphy, a precursor to C.F. Murphy & Associates and later Murphy/Jahn Architects.

He was born in Chupi village of Burdwan district, British India (now Purba Bardhaman district , India ). Son of Pitamber Dutta, he was one of the initiators of the Bengal Renaissance. He left his mark on the history of Bengali prose literature and the Brahmo movement in the mid-nineteenth century, inspired by uninterrupted scientific rationalism ; a member of the Tattvabodhini Sabha established by Devendranath Tagore and for some time he served as its assistant editor. On 13 June 1840, when Debendranath established the Tattvabodhini Pathshala in Calcutta, Akshay Kumar became its teacher. Akshay Kumar was one of the leaders in the Brahmo Samaj who raised questions against this kind of blind scriptural belief. In 1854, an institution ‚ÄúSamjjyoti bidhayini Sahrit Samiti‚Äù was formed mainly for the purpose of eradication of superstition and social welfare. First Debendranath Tagore and then Akshay Kumar Dutt were elected its president and editor respectively. The objectives of this organization included introduction of women's education, introduction of remarriage of Hindu widows, abolition of child marriage and prevention of polygamy. He joined hand with Debendranath regarding against the forcible conversion of Hindus to Christianity by the Christian clergy. He wrote on the page of Tattvabodhini against the oppression of the Nilakars and the cruel oppression of the zamindars. There were mainly two features of the thought process of Brahmo Samaj. One is devotionalism, the other is rationalism. Akshay Kumar has mainly highlighted this rational aspect of Rammahan's life philosophy. In his books ‚ÄúJudgment on the Relation of Human Nature to Exterior‚Äù (Part I, 1851 AD; Part II, 1853 AD) and ‚ÄúReligion‚Äù (1856 AD), he has given a very systematic and rational discussion. Although the first book is based on George Coomb's book, Constitution of Man, it is not an exact translation. The second book is based on various English texts. The terminology he has created in Bengal using the English word in the first text is intriguing and valuable in terms of the construction of public and private terminology at the present time. His ‚ÄòCharupath‚Äô (Part I, 1853 AD; Part II, 1854 AD; Part III, 1859 AD) brought an epoch in the field of early childhood education. His most famous work is the Indian Scholarly Worship '(Part I, 160 AD; Part II, 163 AD). This is the first successful attempt to write such a book in Bengali. Although the book is based primarily on Horace Heyman Wilson's Sketch of the Religious Sects of the Hindus, published in the sixteenth and seventeenth volumes of Asiatic Research, it also contains much of Akshay Kumar's basic research. ‚ÄúThe Voyage and Trade Expansion of His Ancient Hindus‚Äù (published in 1901 after the death of the author and edited by his son Rajininath Dutt) is one such basic research book. His other books include the Lecture of the Third Annual Meeting in Memory of Mr. David Hare (1845 AD); ‚ÄòAdvice to Steam Riders‚Äô (1855 AD); Notable are the proposals for the development of religion (1855 AD) and the study of physics (1856 AD). Well-known Bengali poet Satyendranath Dutta was the grandson of Akshay Kumar Dutta.

It is built using binary adders. A variety of computer arithmetic techniques can be used to implement a digital multiplier. Most techniques involve computing a set of partial products, and then summing the partial products together. This process is similar to the method taught to primary schoolchildren for conducting long multiplication on base-10 integers, but has been modified here for application to a base-2 (binary) numeral system. History Between 1947-1949 Arthur Alec Robinson worked for English Electric Ltd, as a student apprentice, and then as a development engineer. Crucially during this period he studied for a PhD degree at the University of Manchester, where he worked on the design of the hardware multiplier for the early Mark 1 computer. However, until the late 1970s, most minicomputers did not have a multiply instruction, and so programmers used a \\"multiply routine\\"\\"The Evolution of Forth\\" by Elizabeth D. Rather et al. \\"Interfacing a hardware multiplier to a general-purpose microprocessor\\" which repeatedly shifts and accumulates partial results, often written using loop unwinding. Mainframe computers had multiply instructions, but they did the same sorts of shifts and adds as a \\"multiply routine\\". Early microprocessors also had no multiply instruction. Though the multiply instruction became common with the 16-bit generation, at least two 8-bit processors have a multiply instruction: the Motorola 6809, introduced in 1978, and Intel MCS-51 family, developed in 1980, and later the modern Atmel AVR 8-bit microprocessors present in the ATMega, ATTiny and ATXMega microcontrollers. As more transistors per chip became available due to larger- scale integration, it became possible to put enough adders on a single chip to sum all the partial products at once, rather than reuse a single adder to handle each partial product one at a time. Because some common digital signal processing algorithms spend most of their time multiplying, digital signal processor designers sacrifice considerable chip area in order to make the multiply as fast as possible; a single-cycle multiply‚Äìaccumulate unit often used up most of the chip area of early DSPs. Basics The method taught in school for multiplying decimal numbers is based on calculating partial products, shifting them to the left and then adding them together. The most difficult part is to obtain the partial products, as that involves multiplying a long number by one digit (from 0 to 9): 123 x 456 = 738 (this is 123 x 6) 615 (this is 123 x 5, shifted one position to the left) \\\\+ 492 (this is 123 x 4, shifted two positions to the left) = 56088  Binary numbers  A binary computer does exactly the same multiplication as decimal numbers do, but with binary numbers. In binary encoding each long number is multiplied by one digit (either 0 or 1), and that is much easier than in decimal, as the product by 0 or 1 is just 0 or the same number. Therefore, the multiplication of two binary numbers comes down to calculating partial products (which are 0 or the first number), shifting them left, and then adding them together (a binary addition, of course): 1011 (this is 11 in binary) x 1110 (this is 14 in binary)  0000 (this is 1011 x 0) 1011 (this is 1011 x 1, shifted one position to the left) 1011 (this is 1011 x 1, shifted two positions to the left) \\\\+ 1011 (this is 1011 x 1, shifted three positions to the left) = 10011010 (this is 154 in binary) This is much simpler than in the decimal system, as there is no table of multiplication to remember: just shifts and adds. This method is mathematically correct and has the advantage that a small CPU may perform the multiplication by using the shift and add features of its arithmetic logic unit rather than a specialized circuit. The method is slow, however, as it involves many intermediate additions. These additions are time-consuming. Faster multipliers may be engineered in order to do fewer additions; a modern processor can multiply two 64-bit numbers with 6 additions (rather than 64), and can do several steps in parallel. The second problem is that the basic school method handles the sign with a separate rule (\\"+ with + yields +\\", \\"+ with ‚àí yields ‚àí\\", etc.). Modern computers embed the sign of the number in the number itself, usually in the two's complement representation. That forces the multiplication process to be adapted to handle two's complement numbers, and that complicates the process a bit more. Similarly, processors that use ones' complement, sign-and-magnitude, IEEE-754 or other binary representations require specific adjustments to the multiplication process. Unsigned numbers For example, suppose we want to multiply two unsigned eight bit integers together: a[7:0] and b[7:0]. We can produce eight partial products by performing eight one-bit multiplications, one for each bit in multiplicand a: p0[7:0] = a[0] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[0]}} & b[7:0] p1[7:0] = a[1] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[1]}} & b[7:0] p2[7:0] = a[2] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[2]}} & b[7:0] p3[7:0] = a[3] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[3]}} & b[7:0] p4[7:0] = a[4] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[4]}} & b[7:0] p5[7:0] = a[5] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[5]}} & b[7:0] p6[7:0] = a[6] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[6]}} & b[7:0] p7[7:0] = a[7] √ó b[7:0] = {8{a[7]}} & b[7:0] where {8{a[0]}} means repeating a[0] (the 0th bit of a) 8 times (Verilog notation). To produce our product, we then need to add up all eight of our partial products, as shown here: p0[7] p0[6] p0[5] p0[4] p0[3] p0[2] p0[1] p0[0] \\\\+ p1[7] p1[6] p1[5] p1[4] p1[3] p1[2] p1[1] p1[0] 0 \\\\+ p2[7] p2[6] p2[5] p2[4] p2[3] p2[2] p2[1] p2[0] 0 0 \\\\+ p3[7] p3[6] p3[5] p3[4] p3[3] p3[2] p3[1] p3[0] 0 0 0 \\\\+ p4[7] p4[6] p4[5] p4[4] p4[3] p4[2] p4[1] p4[0] 0 0 0 0 \\\\+ p5[7] p5[6] p5[5] p5[4] p5[3] p5[2] p5[1] p5[0] 0 0 0 0 0 \\\\+ p6[7] p6[6] p6[5] p6[4] p6[3] p6[2] p6[1] p6[0] 0 0 0 0 0 0 \\\\+ p7[7] p7[6] p7[5] p7[4] p7[3] p7[2] p7[1] p7[0] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \\\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- P[15] P[14] P[13] P[12] P[11] P[10] P[9] P[8] P[7] P[6] P[5] P[4] P[3] P[2] P[1] P[0] In other words, P[15:0] is produced by summing p0, p1 << 1, p2 << 2, and so forth, to produce our final unsigned 16-bit product. Signed integers If b had been a signed integer instead of an unsigned integer, then the partial products would need to have been sign-extended up to the width of the product before summing. If a had been a signed integer, then partial product p7 would need to be subtracted from the final sum, rather than added to it. The above array multiplier can be modified to support two's complement notation signed numbers by inverting several of the product terms and inserting a one to the left of the first partial product term: 1 ~p0[7] p0[6] p0[5] p0[4] p0[3] p0[2] p0[1] p0[0] ~p1[7] +p1[6] +p1[5] +p1[4] +p1[3] +p1[2] +p1[1] +p1[0] 0 ~p2[7] +p2[6] +p2[5] +p2[4] +p2[3] +p2[2] +p2[1] +p2[0] 0 0 ~p3[7] +p3[6] +p3[5] +p3[4] +p3[3] +p3[2] +p3[1] +p3[0] 0 0 0 ~p4[7] +p4[6] +p4[5] +p4[4] +p4[3] +p4[2] +p4[1] +p4[0] 0 0 0 0 ~p5[7] +p5[6] +p5[5] +p5[4] +p5[3] +p5[2] +p5[1] +p5[0] 0 0 0 0 0 ~p6[7] +p6[6] +p6[5] +p6[4] +p6[3] +p6[2] +p6[1] +p6[0] 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 +p7[7] ~p7[6] ~p7[5] ~p7[4] ~p7[3] ~p7[2] ~p7[1] ~p7[0] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \\\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ P[15] P[14] P[13] P[12] P[11] P[10] P[9] P[8] P[7] P[6] P[5] P[4] P[3] P[2] P[1] P[0] Where ~p represents the complement (opposite value) of p. There are many simplifications in the bit array above that are not shown and are not obvious. The sequences of one complemented bit followed by noncomplemented bits are implementing a two's complement trick to avoid sign extension. The sequence of p7 (noncomplemented bit followed by all complemented bits) is because we're subtracting this term so they were all negated to start out with (and a 1 was added in the least significant position). For both types of sequences, the last bit is flipped and an implicit -1 should be added directly below the MSB. When the +1 from the two's complement negation for p7 in bit position 0 (LSB) and all the -1's in bit columns 7 through 14 (where each of the MSBs are located) are added together, they can be simplified to the single 1 that \\"magically\\" is floating out to the left. For an explanation and proof of why flipping the MSB saves us the sign extension, see a computer arithmetic book.Parhami, Behrooz, Computer Arithmetic: Algorithms and Hardware Designs, Oxford University Press, New York, 2000 (, 490 + xx pp.)  Floating point numbers  A binary floating number contains a sign bit, significant bits (known as the significand) and exponent bits (for simplicity, we don't consider base and combination field). The sign bits of each operand are XOR'd to get the sign of the answer. Then, the two exponents are added to get the exponent of the result. Finally, multiplication of each operand's significand will return the significand of the result. However, if the result of the binary multiplication is higher then the total number of bits for a specific precision (e.g. 32, 64, 128), rounding is required and the exponent is changed appropriately. Implementations The process of multiplication can be split into 3 steps: Mahnoush Rouholamini; Omid Kavehie; Amir-Pasha Mirbaha; Somaye Jafarali Jasbi; and Keivan Navi. \\"A New Design for 7:2 Compressors\\". Yuhao Leong, HaiHiung Lo, Michael Drieberg, Abu Bakar Sayuti, and Patrick Sebastian. \\"Performance Comparison Review of 8-3 compressor on FPGA\\". * generating partial product * reducing partial product * computing final product Older multiplier architectures employed a shifter and accumulator to sum each partial product, often one partial product per cycle, trading off speed for die area. Modern multiplier architectures use the (Modified) Baugh-Wooley algorithm, Wallace trees, or Dadda multipliers to add the partial products together in a single cycle. The performance of the Wallace tree implementation is sometimes improved by modified Booth encoding one of the two multiplicands, which reduces the number of partial products that must be summed. For speed, shift-and-add multipliers require a fast adder (something faster than ripple- carry). A \\"single cycle\\" multiplier (or \\"fast multiplier\\") is pure combinational logic. In a fast multiplier, the partial-product reduction process usually contributes the most to the delay, power, and area of the multiplier. For speed, the \\"reduce partial product\\" stages are typically implemented as a carry-save adder composed of compressors and the \\"compute final product\\" step is implemented as a fast adder (something faster than ripple-carry). Many fast multipliers use full adders as compressors (\\"3:2 compressors\\") implemented in static CMOS.

In addition to their remaining regular pay, it may include some of the following: * Any additional payment based on months of service * Payment for unused accrued PTO vacation time, holiday pay or sick leave unless the employee is picked up by the new buyer wherein all benefits become the responsibility of the new employer. * A payment in lieu of a required notice period. * Retirement accounts (such as 401(k)) or 403(b) benefits * Stock options * Assistance in searching for new work, such as access to employment services or help in producing a r√©sum√©. Packages are most typically offered for employees who are laid off or retire. Severance pay was instituted to help protect the newly unemployed. Sometimes, they may be offered for those who either resign, regardless of the circumstances, or are fired. Policies for severance packages are often found in a company's employee handbook. Severance contracts often stipulate that employees will not sue the employer for wrongful dismissal or attempt to collect on unemployment benefits, and that if they do so, they must return the severance money. Severance packages vary by country depending on government regulation. United States In the United States, there is no requirement in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for severance pay. Instead it is a matter of agreement between employers and employees. Severance agreements, among other things, could prevent an employee from working for a competitor and waive any right to pursue a legal claim against the former employer. Also, an employee may be giving up the right to seek unemployment compensation. An employment attorney may be contacted to assist in the evaluation and review of a severance agreement. The payments in some cases will continue only until the former employee has found another job. In February 2010, a ruling in the Western District of Michigan held that severance pay is not subject to FICA taxes, but it was overturned by the Supreme Court in March 2014. Puerto Rico Employers are required to pay severance pay after an employee working in Puerto Rico is terminated.Puerto Rico Law 80. Sections 185a-185l. Employees are not permitted to waive this payment.Puerto Rico Law 80. Section 185i. Severance pay is not required if the employee was terminated with \\"just cause.\\" Just cause is satisfied in any of the following situations: the employee had a pattern of improper or disorderly conduct; the employee worked inefficiently, belatedly, negligently, poorly; the employee repeatedly violated the employer's reasonable and written rules; the employer had a full, temporary, or partial closing of operations; the employer had technological or reorganization changes, changes in the nature of the product made, and changes in services rendered; or the employer reduced the number of employees because of an actual or expected decrease in production, sales, or profits.Puerto Rico Law 80. Section 185b. An employee with less than five years of employment with the employer must receive a severance payment equal to two months of salary, plus an additional one week of salary for each year of employment. An employee with more than five years but less than fifteen years of employment must receive a severance payment equal to three months of salary, plus an additional two weeks of salary for each year of employment. An employee with more than fifteen years of service must receive a severance payment equal to six months of salary, plus an additional three weeks of salary for each year of employment.Puerto Rico Law 128. Canada Severance agreements are also more than just a \\"thank you\\" payment from an employer in Canada. The amount of severance pay an employee is owed when dismissed without misconduct varies between common law (judge-made law) and employment law. Under employment law In Ontario, the amount of severance pay under the employment law is given in Ontario by Employment Standards Act (ESA), which is also explained in 'Your Guide to the Employment Standards Act's Severance Pay Section'. The amount of severance pay under the employment law in Ontario may be calculated using the tool from Ontario Government. It is stated in ESA's Guide Wrongful dismissal section: \\"The rules under the ESA about termination and severance of employment are minimum requirements. Some employees may have rights under the common law that are greater than the rights to notice of termination (or termination pay) and severance pay under the ESA. An employee may want to sue their former employer in court for wrongful dismissal\\". Under common law Common law provides above-minimal entitlements, using a well-recognized set of factors from Bardal v Globe and Mail Ltd. (the \\"Bardal Factors\\"). Bardal Factors include: * the length of service of the servant, * the age of the servant, * the character of the employment (more senior, longer time needed to reach the similar seniority, job function) * the availability of similar employment, having regard to the experience, training and qualifications of the servant (the likelihood of getting a similar job in the future). There is a severance pay calculator based on common law \\"Bardal Factors\\" that predicts the amount of severance pay owed as determined by the court. The goal is to provide enough notice or pay in lieu for the employee to find comparable employment. Unlike statutory minimum notice, the courts will award much more than 8 weeks if warranted by the circumstances, with over 24 months' worth of pay in damages possible. Other factors considered may include: * Inducement: If you were convinced to leave a previous job for one which quickly let you go, you may be able to get extra compensation, especially if your previous position was very stable and you were not looking for a new job. * Bad faith: If you were fired in a particularly cruel manner, harassed or lied to by your employer, extra compensation may be required. Also see Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd. * Duty to mitigate: You must show that you are actively looking for another job. * Wilful misconduct by the employee: This is more than simply not doing a good job, but involves being deliberately and recklessly negligent or disobedient. The biggest factor in determining severance is re- employability. If someone is in a field or market where they will have great difficulty finding work, the court will provide more severance. The reason being that the primary purpose of severance is to provide the wrongfully dismissed employee the opportunity to secure other employment within the period provided. (See also Canada section in wrongful dismissal for related litigation cases in Canada.)  Dismissal with cause and termination without cause  In Canadian common law, there is a basic distinction as to dismissals. There are two basic types of dismissals, or terminations: dismissal with cause (just cause) and termination without cause. An example of cause would be an employee's behavior which constitutes a fundamental breach of the terms of the employment contract. Where cause exists, the employer can dismiss the employee without providing any notice. If no cause exists yet the employer dismisses without providing lawful notice, then the dismissal is a wrongful dismissal.  Litigation for wrongful dismissal  There is a time limit of two years from the date of termination for suing the employer in Ontario. This litigation follows civil procedure in Ontario. Before starting a court case, there are other options, such as, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration. Typically in a civil lawsuit, in 2019, it can cost $1,500‚Äì$5,000 to initiate an action and have a lawyer deliver a Statement of Claim. Responding to the opposing side's documents and conducting examinations for discovery will likely involve another $3,500‚Äì$5,000. The preparation and presentation of your case at trial is likely to add another $5,000‚Äî$15,000 to your legal costs. These legal expense is income tax deductible. There are free Legal information and referral services offered on a confidential basis funded from government (The Access to Justice Fund) for all areas of law in major cities, such as, Ottawa Legal Information Centre. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom Labour Law provides for Redundancy Pay. The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is ¬£15,240. Italy In Italy, severance pay (TFR) is provided in all cases of termination of the employment relationship, for whatever reason: individual and collective dismissal, resignation, etc. The law recognizes subordinate workers the right to receive severance pay, pursuant to article 2120 of the civil code. China The severance payment in China shall be based on the number of years the employee has worked for the employer at the rate of one month salary for each full year worked. Any period of no less than six months but less than one year shall be counted as one year. The severance payment payable to an employee for any period of less than six months shall be one half of his/her monthly salary.Labor Contract Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China If the monthly salary of an employee is higher than 3 times local average monthly salary where the employer is located, the rate for the severance payment to be paid shall be 3 times local average monthly salary and shall be for no more than 12 years. Where any employee obtains lump-sum compensation income (including economic compensation, living allowances and other subsidies granted by an employer) from the employer's termination of labor relationship with him/her, the part of the income which is no more than three times the average wage amount of employees in the local area in the previous year shall be exempt from individual income tax. The fraction of the compensation that exceeds 3 times the local annual average salary shall be taxed as individual income tax as follows: For those employees receiving a lump sum compensation, the lump sum can be considered as receiving monthly salaries in one time, and shall be allocated to a certain period in average amount. This average amount will be calculated dividing the lump sum by the service years with the current employer, and will be taxed as monthly salaries. For the number of service years with the current employer, the actual number of years should be considered. If the number of years is more than 12, only 12 will be considered.

Comet is an umbrella term, encompassing multiple techniques for achieving this interaction. All these methods rely on features included by default in browsers, such as JavaScript, rather than on non-default plugins. The Comet approach differs from the original model of the web, in which a browser requests a complete web page at a time. The use of Comet techniques in web development predates the use of the word Comet as a neologism for the collective techniques. Comet is known by several other names, including Ajax Push, Reverse Ajax, Two-way-web, HTTP Streaming, and HTTP server push among others. The term Comet is not an acronym, but was coined by Alex Russell in his 2006 blog post Comet: Low Latency Data for the Browser. In recent years, the standardisation and widespread support of WebSocket and Server-sent events has rendered the Comet model obsolete. History Early Java applets The ability to embed Java applets into browsers (starting with Netscape Navigator 2.0 in March 1996) made two-way sustained communications possible, using a raw TCP socket\\"java.net.Socket (Java 2 Platform SE v1.4.2)\\" to communicate between the browser and the server. This socket can remain open as long as the browser is at the document hosting the applet. Event notifications can be sent in any format text or binary and decoded by the applet. The first browser-to-browser communication framework The very first application using browser-to-browser communications was Tango Interactive, implemented in 1996‚Äì98 at the Northeast Parallel Architectures Center (NPAC) at Syracuse University using DARPA funding. TANGO architecture has been patented by Syracuse University. TANGO framework has been extensively used as a distance education tool. The framework has been commercialized by CollabWorx and used in a dozen or so Command&Control; and Training applications in the United States Department of Defense. First Comet applications The first set of Comet implementations date back to 2000, with the Pushlets, Lightstreamer, and KnowNow projects. Pushlets, a framework created by Just van den Broecke, was one of the firstJust van den Broecke (1 March 2000). ‚ÄúPushlets: Send events from servlets to DHTML client browsers‚Äù. JavaWorld. Retrieved 1 August 2014. open source implementations. Pushlets were based on server-side Java servlets, and a client-side JavaScript library. Bang Networks a Silicon Valley start-up backed by Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen had a lavishly-financed attempt to create a real-time push standard for the entire web. In April 2001, Chip Morningstar began developing a Java-based (J2SE) web server which used two HTTP sockets to keep open two communications channels between the custom HTTP server he designed and a client designed by Douglas Crockford; a functioning demo system existed as of June 2001. The server and client used a messaging format that the founders of State Software, Inc. assented to coin as JSON following Crockford's suggestion. The entire system, the client libraries, the messaging format known as JSON and the server, became the State Application Framework, parts of which were sold and used by Sun Microsystems, Amazon.com, EDS and Volkswagen.

Retrieved 18 February 2008. Implementations Comet applications attempt to eliminate the limitations of the page-by-page web model and traditional polling by offering two-way sustained interaction, using a persistent or long-lasting HTTP connection between the server and the client. Since browsers and proxies are not designed with server events in mind, several techniques to achieve this have been developed, each with different benefits and drawbacks. The biggest hurdle is the HTTP 1.1 specification, which states \\"this specification... encourages clients to be conservative when opening multiple connections\\".Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing, section 6.4. IETF. Retrieved 2014-07-29 Therefore, holding one connection open for real-time events has a negative impact on browser usability: the browser may be blocked from sending a new request while waiting for the results of a previous request, e.g., a series of images. This can be worked around by creating a distinct hostname for real-time information, which is an alias for the same physical server. This strategy is an application of domain sharding. Specific methods of implementing Comet fall into two major categories: streaming and long polling. Streaming An application using streaming Comet opens a single persistent connection from the client browser to the server for all Comet events. These events are incrementally handled and interpreted on the client side every time the server sends a new event, with neither side closing the connection. Specific techniques for accomplishing streaming Comet include the following: Hidden iframe A basic technique for dynamic web application is to use a hidden iframe HTML element (an inline frame, which allows a website to embed one HTML document inside another). This invisible iframe is sent as a chunked block, which implicitly declares it as infinitely long (sometimes called \\"forever frame\\"). As events occur, the iframe is gradually filled with \`script\` tags, containing JavaScript to be executed in the browser. Because browsers render HTML pages incrementally, each \`script\` tag is executed as it is received. Some browsers require a specific minimum document size before parsing and execution is started, which can be obtained by initially sending 1‚Äì2 kB of padding spaces. One benefit of the iframes method is that it works in every common browser. Two downsides of this technique are the lack of a reliable error handling method, and the impossibility of tracking the state of the request calling process. XMLHttpRequest The XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, a tool used by Ajax applications for browser‚Äìserver communication, can also be pressed into service for server‚Äìbrowser Comet messaging by generating a custom data format for an XHR response, and parsing out each event using browser-side JavaScript; relying only on the browser firing the \`onreadystatechange\` callback each time it receives new data. Ajax with long polling None of the above streaming transports work across all modern browsers without negative side-effects. This forces Comet developers to implement several complex streaming transports, switching between them depending on the browser. Consequently, many Comet applications use long polling, which is easier to implement on the browser side, and works, at minimum, in every browser that supports XHR. As the name suggests, long polling requires the client to poll the server for an event (or set of events). The browser makes an Ajax-style request to the server, which is kept open until the server has new data to send to the browser, which is sent to the browser in a complete response. The browser initiates a new long polling request in order to obtain subsequent events. IETF RFC 6202 \\"Known Issues and Best Practices for the Use of Long Polling and Streaming in Bidirectional HTTP\\" compares long polling and HTTP streaming. Specific technologies for accomplishing long-polling include the following: XMLHttpRequest long polling For the most part, XMLHttpRequest long polling works like any standard use of XHR. The browser makes an asynchronous request of the server, which may wait for data to be available before responding. The response can contain encoded data (typically XML or JSON) or Javascript to be executed by the client. At the end of the processing of the response, the browser creates and sends another XHR, to await the next event. Thus the browser always keeps a request outstanding with the server, to be answered as each event occurs. Script tag long polling While any Comet transport can be made to work across subdomains, none of the above transports can be used across different second-level domains (SLDs), due to browser security policies designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. That is, if the main web page is served from one SLD, and the Comet server is located at another SLD (which does not have cross-origin resource sharing enabled), Comet events cannot be used to modify the HTML and DOM of the main page, using those transports. This problem can be sidestepped by creating a proxy server in front of one or both sources, making them appear to originate from the same domain. However, this is often undesirable for complexity or performance reasons. Unlike iframes or XMLHttpRequest objects, \`script\` tags can be pointed at any URI, and JavaScript code in the response will be executed in the current HTML document. This creates a potential security risk for both servers involved, though the risk to the data provider (in our case, the Comet server) can be avoided using JSONP. A long-polling Comet transport can be created by dynamically creating \`script\` elements, and setting their source to the location of the Comet server, which then sends back JavaScript (or JSONP) with some event as its payload. Each time the script request is completed, the browser opens a new one, just as in the XHR long polling case. This method has the advantage of being cross-browser while still allowing cross-domain implementations. Alternatives Browser-native technologies are inherent in the term Comet. Attempts to improve non-polling HTTP communication have come from multiple sides: * The HTML 5 draft specification produced by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) specifies so called server-sent events, which defines a new JavaScript interface \`EventSource\` and a new MIME type \`text/event-stream\`. All major browsers except Microsoft Internet Explorer include this technology. * The HTML 5 WebSocket API working draft specifies a method for creating a persistent connection with a server and receiving messages via an \`onmessage\` callback. * The Bayeux protocol by the Dojo Foundation. It leaves browser-specific transports in place, and defines a higher-level protocol for communication between browser and server, with the aim of allowing re-use of client-side JavaScript code with multiple Comet servers, and allowing the same Comet server to communicate with multiple client-side JavaScript implementations. Bayeux is based on a publish/subscribe model, so servers supporting Bayeux have publish/subscribe built-in. * The BOSH protocol by the XMPP standards foundation. It emulates a bidirectional stream between browser and server by using two synchronous HTTP connections. * The JSONRequest object, proposed by Douglas Crockford, would be an alternative to the XHR object. * Use of plugins, such as Java applets or the proprietary Adobe Flash (using RTMP protocol for data streaming to Flash applications). These have the advantage of working identically across all browsers with the appropriate plugin installed and need not rely on HTTP connections, but the disadvantage of requiring the plugin to be installed * Google announcedApp, The.

The constitutional system has influences from the Corpus Juris Civilis and Roman customary law. It may have the oldest surviving constitution of any sovereign state in the world. The Statutes of 1600 The current legal system of the Most Serene Republic of San Marino began on October 8, 1600. The government gave binding force to a compilation of Statuti written by Camillo Bonelli, covering the institutions and practices of Sammarinese government and justice at that time. It was written in Latin and contained in six books. The title in Latin is Statuta Decreta ac Ordinamenta Illustris Reipublicae ac Perpetuae Libertatis Terrae Sancti Marini. The new system was an update on the Statuti Comunali (Town Statute) which had served San Marino from about 1300. Existing institutions, such as the Council of the Sixty, were carried forward from this period. The Statutes form the basis of all law in effect today, and so it may be the oldest constitution of any existing nation.  Book One  The first book contains 62 articles. It is constitutional in character and describes the various councils of San Marino, courts, a number of administrative positions, including the Captains-Regent, and the powers assigned to them. The last two articles explain how the law is to be interpreted and altered, including how the law is to be promulgated.  Book Two  The second book, called Civilium Causarum, contains 75 articles. The first half provides for civil law procedures covering subpoenas, evidence, examination of witnesses and judicial expenses. The second half covers minors, education, the salaries of the civil service and wills. There is a section which promotes compromise to resolve disputes and another which regulates the salary of lawyers.  Book Three  The third book, called Maleficiorum, contains 74 articles and covers criminal law. Prosecution of criminal acts is reserved for the state alone. The laws provide a formula by which a punishment shall be proportional to the offense and any mitigating circumstances. Special attention is given to protecting the assets of the state and church, and to preventing the pollution of water sources.  Book Four  The fourth book, called De Appellationibus, contains 15 articles. The volume explains how judges are nominated, the classification of sentences, appeals and appellant guarantees.  Book Five  The fifth book, called Extraordinarium, contains 46 articles covering a range of topics. These include the sale of meat, sanitation and health, water reserves and roads.  Book Six  The sixth book contains 42 articles and covers compensation, weights and plant cultivation. In particular, it explains that family heads are responsible for the actions of their sons and any servants. Declaration of Citizen Rights On 12 July 1974 the Captains- Regent signed a law (59/1974) adopted by the Grand and General Council containing a declaration of citizen rights and the fundamental principles of the juridical order of San Marino. The Declaration begins with a repudiation of war. It states the people are sovereign and explains how the separation of powers doctrine is applicable to San Marino. Citizens are guaranteed certain rights including equality, inviolability, freedom, and universal suffrage. Jorri Duursma describes the 1974 law as the fundamental law of the Republic. The Declaration was amended in 2002, providing further constitutional detail on the organisation of government and establishing the Guarantors‚Äô Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules, which is a court responsible for assessing the compliance of laws with respect to the Declaration of Rights.

Transactions of the American Philosophical Society Vol II, No. 43, 1953. pp. 548, 546. The period of time designated by trinundium has been taken to mean either three Roman eight-day weeks (that is, 24 days) or tertiae nundinae, on the third market-day (17 days).Lintott, A. W. Trinvndinvm. The Classical Quarterly Vol 15, No 2, Nov. 1965. pp. 281-285. The second provision of the lex Caecilia Didia forbade leges saturae, \\"stuffed\\" laws, which were statutes dealing with heterogeneous subject matters. This meant that in a single Roman bill, there could not be a collection of unrelated measures ‚Äî what might in modern terms be called omnibus bills. Cicero gave an interpretation of the law in his Oratio de domo sua (\\"Speech concerning His House\\") after his return from exile: \\"What other force, what other meaning, I should like to know, has the Caecilian and Didian law, except this; that the people are not to be forced in consequence of many different things being joined in one complicated bill.\\"Cicero, Marcus Tullius. Oratio de Domo Sua. 53. It did not take long for the lex Caecilia Didia to be put into action. Most significantly, in 91 BC the consul Lucius Marcius Philippus, in his capacity as an augur, managed to have the laws of the tribune Marcus Livius Drusus the Younger abrogated on the grounds that they contravened the second provision of the lex Caecilia Didia.Cicero, Marcus Tullius. Oratio de Domo Sua. 41 This act is often seen as a major contributory factor in the outbreak of the Social War (91‚Äì88 BC).e.g. Appian, Bellum Civile, 1.35‚Äì7; Velleius Paterculus, History of Rome, 2.13‚Äì15; Livy, 71 Political background The lex Caecilia Didia was a direct response to the events of 100 BC and an attempt to reduce hasty legislation passed in the comitia. In that year, Gaius Marius gained his sixth term as consul. Under Marius, the popularist tribune Saturninus and the praetor Glaucia proposed and passed liberal land laws assigning land in the province of Africa to Marius‚Äôs veterans. However, the radical nature of these bills and the forcible methods Saturninus and Glaucia used in ensuring their passage alienated a large part of the Roman people and eventually even Marius. As a result Saturninus‚Äôs laws were repealed, and the lex Caecilia Didia was introduced. The goal was to curb the passage of radical bills, with the assumption that the period of trinundium would give the citizens time to understand the proposed law or to be persuaded to vote against it.Abbot, Frank Frost.

He also led Gil and served as Minister of Senior Citizens. He was in charge of the Mossad operation that led to the arrest of Adolf Eichmann. He served as an advisor on terrorism to Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and in 1981 he was appointed to head the Bureau of Scientific Relations, then an intelligence entity on par with Mossad, Aman and Shabak. Eitan assumed responsibility for and resigned over the Jonathan Pollard affair, and the Bureau was disbanded. He was subject to an arrest warrant issued by the United States FBI.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-47682454 From 1985 until 1993, he was head of the government's Chemicals company, which was expanded under his leadership. After 1993, he became a businessman, noted for several large scale agricultural and construction ventures in Cuba. He was the chairman of the Vetek (Seniority) Association ‚Äì the Senior Citizens Movement.  Life and career  Eitan was born in kibbutz Ein Harod during the Mandate era. His parents were Zionist immigrants from Russia who came to Palestine in 1923. His father Noach Hantman was a farmer and poet and his mother Yehudit Volwelsky was a social activist. They had four children, Rafi, Oded, Rina and Ami (Yechiam) and lived in Ramat HaSharon, which at the time was a small settlement of 100 families. Eitan went to a regular public junior high school, but finished his high school studies at the Agricultural School in Givat HaShlosha in 1940 before going to the London School of Economics for his BSc in Economics. At age 12, engulfed in the prevalent Zionist sentiments of the day and to defend his settlement from Arab attacks, Eitan joined the Haganah from which he moved to the Palmach, the elite unit of the Haganah, upon completion of high school in 1944. Through clandestine operations, he was to assist the illegal immigration of Jewish refugees from Europe, who were fleeing Nazism, into Palestine. It was also during this time that he met Yitzhak Rabin, who would later become Israeli Prime Minister. He also took part in a raid on the Atlit detention camp to free illegal Jewish immigrants being detained by the British, the Night of the Bridges, and the November 1946 killings of two Templers to deter the rest of the German Templer community from returning to their homes in Palestine following World War II. His most famous operation at this time was blowing up the British radar on Mount Carmel near the port city of Haifa, which was being used to track ships carrying illegal Jewish immigrants. To reach it, Eitan had to crawl underground through sewers, thus earning the name 'Rafi the Stinker', which would differentiate him in later years from the other Rafael Eitan, a well-known Israeli Chief of Staff and politician. While on an operation to assist illegal Jewish immigrants, he was injured in a mine explosion while planting mines to prevent the British from interfering and was rendered almost totally deaf. He relied on hearing aids for the rest of his life. During the 1947-1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Eitan served as a soldier in the Yiftach Brigade, participating in combat operations, and was wounded in combat on the day after Israeli independence was declared. He also served as an intelligence officer.  Career in intelligence  From his service as an intelligence officer, he was propelled to commanding posts in the internal intelligence agency (Shin Bet). Later, Eitan served as Chief of Coordination between Shin Bet and Mossad. This position would allow him the biggest triumph in a post-Holocaust Israel: the capture of Adolf Eichmann. After Israeli intelligence located Eichmann and his family in Argentina, Eitan and his team flew there to apprehend him and return him to Israel, where he was tried and found guilty of atrocities against the Jewish people during World War II. While working to capture Eichmann, Eitan personally vetoed the capture of Josef Mengele, who was under Mossad surveillance, arguing that the loss of focus could jeopardize the Eichmann mission.Israelis let Mengele escape, ex- agent says Associated Press, 2 September 2008 During 1964‚Äì1966, Eitan headed a two-year operation in which armaments sold and delivered by the Germans to the Egyptian government 'disappeared'. In those days, Israel had no peace treaty with Egypt. In 1968 Eitan, posing as an Israeli Ministry of Defense chemist, visited the U.S. Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) nuclear fuel plant. It emerged that 200 pounds of highly enriched uranium had disappeared from the plant, and it was alleged that the material had been diverted to Israel in an operation that became known as The Apollo Affair.Jefferson Morley, The Ghost: The Secret Life of CIA Spymaster James Jesus Angleton, St. Martin's Press, 2017 pp.192.194Jefferson Morley, Rafi Eitan, spy at center of Israel‚Äôs great uranium heist from the U.S., Mondoweiss 27 March 2019 Eitan was also involved in the planning and implementation of the attack on the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor in June 1981. In June 1984, Eitan was responsible for an espionage operation against the United States during which he recruited Naval Intelligence Analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard to steal American intelligence material. The operation lasted eighteen months and was shut down after the arrest of Pollard, who was convicted and served 30 years of a life sentence.Mitch Gisnburg, (November 30, 2014). Peres, Rabin knew Pollard was planted in US armed forces, handler says. The Times of Israel.  Post-intelligence career  Eitan continued his work in intelligence until 1972, when he left the organization and went on to the private sector, raising tropical fish and other agricultural ventures. But in 1978, the government of Menachem Begin, the then Prime Minister of Israel, called him back to be his advisor on terrorism, as Eitan was regarded and admired as one of the most respected experts in this field. In 1981, Eitan was named head of the Defense Ministry's Lekem, the Bureau for Scientific Relations, replacing legendary Israeli spy-master Benjamin Blumberg, where he continued work on counter-terrorism. According to the British journalist, Gordon Thomas, Eitan then participated in a partnership between Israeli and U.S. intelligence during the early 1980s in selling to foreign intelligence agencies in excess of $500 million worth of licenses to a trojan horse version of the Washington, D.C.-based, Inslaw Inc.'s people-tracking software called PROMIS, in order to spy on them. In 1984, Lekem was put in touch with Jonathan Pollard, an American citizen, who worked on anti-terrorist activities at the US Naval Investigative Services. According to Jonathan Morley, Polland was an agent run by Eitan. Pollard had contacted the Israeli government with top secret information on the terrorist activities of Israel's enemies. Jonathan Pollard was exposed and arrested in the US in 1985. His arrest revealed the existence of Lekem to US authorities. Also in 1985 In California, a US Aerospace Engineer, Richard Kelly Smyth, the president of a company called MILCO, was indicted for smuggling over 800 krytron to Israel without the required US State Department Munitions Export License. Because of their potential for use as triggers of nuclear weapons, the export of krytrons is tightly regulated in the United States. A number of cases involving the smuggling or attempted smuggling of krytrons have been reported, as countries seeking to develop nuclear weapons have attempted to procure supplies of krytrons for igniting their weapons. Just before trial, and facing a possible 105 years in prison, Richard Kelly Smyth and his wife suddenly disappeared. Sixteen years later they were discovered and arrested while living as fugitives in M√°laga, Spain, and extradited back to the United States where he was convicted in the case. The krytrons shipped by Smyth were sent to an Israeli company called Heli-Trading Ltd. owned by prominent Israeli movie producer Arnon Milchan. Before his prominent Hollywood career, Milchan had served for decades as a Lekem agent, under the direct command of Eitan's predecessor, Benjamin Blumberg. It later became clear that the company MILCO served as a Lekem front company for obtaining sensitive equipment, technologies and materials for Israeli secret defense-related programs, and in particular its nuclear program. The Israeli government asserted that the MILCO krytron incident was a simple mistake by the \\"exporter\\" MILCO, and that the Pollard operation was an unauthorized deviation from its policy of not conducting espionage in the United States, before an admission in 1998 of Israeli responsibility. In 1987 the Israeli government set up a commission to investigate Lekem's failure, which found it would be in Israel's interest to take responsibility for the Pollard case. In 1987 following the difficult Pollard and MILCO cases, the Israeli government decided to disband Lekem, whose functions were assigned to the Director of Security of the Defense Establishment, adding technical and scientific intelligence to its responsibilities which include internal investigations of the defense ministry. Following the disbandment of Lekem, Eitan was offered the position as head of the state-owned Israel Chemicals Corporation, from which he retired in 1993 at the age of 67. During his tenure, the company underwent a rapid expansion in terms of sales, development and manpower, making it the largest government-held firm in the country. In 1998 he appeared in the documentary special The Spy Machine, produced by Open Media and Israfilm and shown on Channel 4.  Advisor to MI6 on Counter-Terrorism  Further revelations from the book Gideon's Spies:The Secret History of the Mossad by Gordon Thomas, describe how the Margaret Thatcher government in Britain during the mid-1980s developed a relationship with Eitan as an advisor to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) on counterterrorism operations in Northern Ireland. This relationship came to a head in 1985, when Mossad agents helped track a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb team in Gibraltar. The three- member IRA team was killed (Operation Flavius) by the British Special Air Service, under highly controversial circumstances. It was subsequently reported in British papers that Eitan and Mossad had played a surveillance role in the operation, and IRA command put out orders for assassination teams in Ireland and Britain to find and kill Rafi Eitan. Due to this threat of assassination, and the embarrassment of the Israeli government over Eitan's unauthorized relationship with the operation, Eitan left Britain and ended his relationship with Britain's intelligence services. This incident strained Israeli/British relations for several years.  Cuban business venture  In 1992, Eitan was approached to bid on a contract for an agricultural deal in Cuba, which involved the cultivation of the largest citrus grove cooperative on the island. After winning the bid, Eitan built a partnership with four other international entrepreneurs to run the deal. The company BM Group was incorporated in Panama, and traded with Israeli suppliers. Due to the success of the venture and the connections acquired, BM also won the contract to build the world trade center in Havana, and a Holocaust Memorial at the center of the Old City of Havana. Recently, GBM was awarded the \\"Medal for Agricultural Work\\" by the Cuban government. In addition to this deal, BM has started expanding its business deals to the rest of Latin America. It runs various agricultural projects in the Dominican Republic, among others.  Political career  Eitan was asked to represent the pensioners' party Gil in the 2006 Knesset elections. The party went on to win seven seats, despite predictions that it would not secure more than three, at best, and would not pass the vote threshold, at worst. In the 2009 elections the party failed to cross the electoral threshold, and Eitan lost his seat. In February 2010, Eitan remarked \\"In principle, when there is a war on terror you conduct it without principles. You simply fight it.\\".\\"Will biometric passports limit the reach of Israel's intelligence?\\" In 2018 Eitan caused surprise and shock in Israel and Germany when he publicly endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. He said:: ‚ÄúPlease understand that all of us in Israel appreciate your attitude toward Judaism. In any case, I‚Äôm sure that if you work wisely strongly and most important realistically‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure that instead of ‚ÄòAlternative for Germany,‚Äô you might become an alternative for all of Europe.‚Äù Jeremy Issacharoff, Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to Germany, wrote: ‚ÄúIt is hard to believe how the person who captured Eichmann ‚Ä¶ is able to praise German right- wingers who so admire the Nazi past and wish on us that they become the alternative of Europe! Sad and shameful.‚Äùhttps://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article190761317/Nazi-Jaeger- Rafi-Eitan-Erster-toedlicher-Auftrag- mit-17.htmlhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-slams-shameful-former- minister-who-endorses-german-far-right-party/  Personal life  In his spare time, Eitan was an avid sculptor. Over the 30 years that he sculpted, Eitan produced over 100 pieces. He had a one-man show at the offices of the high- tech company \\"Brown\\". Eitan died at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv on 23 March 2019, at the age of 92. His funeral took place the following day. He was buried in Netanya in a civil ceremony.

History \\"Nisbet in his Heraldry (Edinburgh 1722) says 'The Dicksons are descendants from Richard Keith, said to be a son of the family of Keith, Earls Marischals of Scotland' and in proof thereof carry the chief of Keith Marischal. This Richard was commonly called Dick and the 'son' was styled after him. The affix of son in the Lowlands answering the prefix Mac in the Highlands.\\" As a result, Clan Dickson is considered a sept of Clan Keith. Richard Keith's son, Thomas, took the surname \\"Dickson,\\" meaning \\"Dick's son\\" or \\"Richard's son\\". Thomas Dickson (1247‚Äì1307) himself has quite a history. He was associated in some way with William Wallace, and was killed by the English in 1307 in battle. Tradition states he was slashed across the abdomen but continued fight holding the abdominal wound closed with one hand until he finally dropped dead. He is buried in the churchyard of St Brides, Douglas, and his marker shows him with a sword in one hand holding his belly with the other. Robert the Bruce made him Castellan of Castle Douglas the year before he was killed. The Dicksons/Dixons (and 30 other derivates) family name was first found in Scotland whilst the Dixons in England who are of Scottish descent from Thomas Dickson living in 1268 are of the same origin as the Scottish Dicksons. Early records show Thomas Dicson, a follower of the Douglas clan, at the capture of Castle Douglas in 1307. The Dickson's coat of arms show the Keith \\"pallets gules\\" and the Douglas \\"mullets argent\\", this is to show their descent from these two ancient Scottish noble families. The family mottoes include \\"Fortes fortuna juvat\\", \\"Coelum versus\\", for Dickson: translated as \\"Fortune favours the brave\\", Heavenward\\"; whilst \\"Quod dixi dixi\\" Dixon, is translated as \\"What I have said I have said\\".

Later, however, a redacted version of the report was made available online through the Defense Technical Information Center.  A View of Operation Iraqi Freedom  A View of Operation Iraqi Freedom from Saddam's Senior Leadership is a comprehensive study of the inner workings of the government of Saddam Hussein based on certain documents seized in Iraq in 2003 known as the Operation Iraqi Freedom Documents and on interviews with various Iraqi personnel. An incomplete analysis In the foreword to the book, General Anthony Cucolo writes: > Though this project is an important initial step, we acknowledge the history > of OIF is far from complete. Researchers continue to locate, translate, and > analyze information that will shed new light on our former adversary's > perspective of the conflict. It is in the interest of getting as much > accurate information as possible into the hands of those already studying > Operation Iraqi Freedom that we release this book. Saddam's Delusions A shorter analysis of these documents by the study's principal authors (Pentagon analysts Kevin Woods, James Lacey, and Williamson Murray) entitled \\"Saddam's Delusions\\" argues that the documents above confirm that Saddam's overall strategic calculus was based on misinformation and faulty judgment about the country's confrontation with the United States. For example, the authors wrote: \\"As far as can be determined from the interviews and records reviewed so far, there was no national plan to embark on a guerrilla war in the event of a military defeat. Nor did the regime appear to cobble together such a plan as its world crumbled around it. Buoyed by his earlier conviction that the Americans would never dare enter Baghdad, Saddam hoped to the very last minute that he could stay in power. And his military and civilian bureaucrats went through their daily routines until the very end.\\" Conclusions The report contains the following conclusions: * Saddam seriously miscalculated probable coalition military strategy. In large part, he was unwilling to believe that US troops would expose themselves to possible casualties, or that the coalition would engage in a ground campaign without a lengthy prior air campaign. (Study, pages viii-ix, 15-16). * Saddam kept grip on Iraq through a merciless police state and was always on the watch for conspiracies. He was particularly concerned about Jewish conspiracies, ranging from his theories that Jews manipulated United Nations Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali to cause Iraq problems with the UN during the 1990s to his theories that Jews were responsible for the Mongols' decision to sack Baghdad. His paranoia about Zionist conspiracies was spread to his security services. In a memorandum provided by the General Security Directorate in 2001 it was reported that \\"the cartoon character Pok√©mon\\", widely beloved by Iraqi youth, was part of a plot by international Zionism to undermine Iraq's security. (Study, page 5) * Iraqi military forces had been conditioned to fight and anticipate wars similar to that fought against Iran - slow tempo, bloody, lengthy campaigns. Iraqi military planners, and Saddam in particular, did not appear to understand or anticipate the speed and technological sophistication of the coalition forces. (Study, pages 45‚Äì46). * Prior to the war, Iraq's long-term goal was to use its oil revenues to influence the UN (particularly France and Russia) and lift sanctions. (Study, page 90). However, Saddam also believed that for diplomatic purposes, he had to convince numerous competitors that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, particularly since the belief in his WMD increased his status in the Arab world. (Study, pages 91‚Äì93). For example, Chemical Ali reported that while he personally believed that Iraq did not have WMD, \\"Saddam was asked about the weapons during a meeting with members of the Revolutionary Command Council. He replied that Iraq did not have WMD but flatly rejected a suggestion that the regime remove all doubts to the contrary, going on to explain that such a declaration might encourage the Israelis to attack.\\" (Study page 92). Saddam's deceptions on the issue of WMD were sufficiently successful that even months after the 2003 war, senior Iraqi officials continued to believe it possible \\"that Iraq still possessed a WMD capacity hidden away somewhere.\\" Ironically, these officials' belief were based on a combination of Saddam's deceptions, the secrecy and compartmentalization of the Iraqi government, and on the Iraqi officials' faith in reports of CIA assessments of the Iraqi government's WMD programs. (Study, page 92). * The study also cites documents demonstrating that key evidence presented by Colin Powell to the United Nations in February 2003 had been misinterpreted by the U.S. government. According to the study, Saddam decided in 2002 to attempt to persuade the UN that Iraq was free of WMD. However, Western intelligence services interpreted Iraqi instructions to ensure compliance with UN regulations as attempts to conceal WMD. One example is a message between two Iraqi Republican Guard Corps commanders discussing the removal of the words \\"nerve agents\\" from \\"the wireless instructions,\\" or to \\"search the area surrounding the headquarters camp and [the unit] for any chemical agents, make sure the area is free of chemical containers, and write a report on it\\". According to the study, \\"What was meant to prevent suspicion thus ended up heightening it.\\" (Study, pages 93‚Äì94). * There is additional evidence of failure to cooperate on the part of the Iraqis. For example, a December 15, 2002 memo from an undercover Iraqi Intelligence escort for a UN inspection team wrote: \\"Inside Bader WMD inspection site, there are Russian and Turkish scientists. When we visited the site, they were forced to hide from inspectors' eyes.\\" The study authors concluded that \\"even when viewed through a post-war lens, documentary evidence of messages are consistent with the Iraqi Survey Group's conclusion that Saddam was at least keeping a WMD program primed for a quick re-start the moment the UN Security Council lifted sanctions. (Study, page 95). Saddam and Terrorism The Saddam and Terrorism report was completed November 2007 and scheduled for release in March, 2008. Although this report was originally planned to be released as a PDF available on the JSF website and by email, it was announced that it would be available only as a CD that would have to be requested. However, the report is available through the Defense Technical Information Center website. The CD has five documents; volume 1 is the report itself; the other four are appendices, mostly of the original documents translated into English. Each is marked as redacted. Various web sites have posted the documents, such as National Public Radio.

Bury, in page 386, Appendix of volume 9, Notes by the Editor, in the (New York: Fred de Fau and Co., 1906) edition of Edward Gibbon, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776), ed. J.B. Bury with an Introduction by W.E.H. Lecky. The Chronicle of the Morea () is a long 14th-century history text, of which four versions are extant: in French, Greek (in verse), Italian and Aragonese. More than 9,000 lines long, the Chronicle narrates events of the Franks' establishment of feudalism in mainland Greece. West European Crusaders settled in the Peloponnese (called Morea at the time) following the Fourth Crusade. The period covered in the Chronicle was 1204 to 1292 (or later, depending on the version). It gives significant details on the civic organization of the Principality of Achaia. The extant texts of the Chronicle of the Morea The Greek text is the only text written in verse. The French, Italian and Aragonese texts are written in prose.Jean-Claude Polet, Patrimoine litt√©raire europ√©en, De Boeck Universit√©, 1995, Greek text The verses of the Greek text are written in a 15-syllable political verse. The verses are accented but not rhymed.William Smith, A History of Greece, R. B. Collins, 1855, p. 579 It is written in the spoken Greek of the time, with the inclusion of several French words. There are two parallel Greek texts, as well as three copies: *Ms Havniensis 57 (14th-15th century, in Copenhagen) 9219 verses **Ms Taurinensis B.II.I, library of Turin, closely related to the Copenhagen text *Ms Parisinus graecus 2898 (15th-16th century, at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Paris) 8191 verses **Ms Parisinus graecus 2753 and **Ms Bern 509 grec, both copies of the Paris version. The oldest text is that held in Copenhagen, the language of which is more archaic. The Parisian, more recent, text is simpler in language and has fewer foreign words. The transcriber omitted several anti- Hellenic references, so the overall text expressed less contempt of Greeks.P. Kolonaros, Œ§Œø ŒßœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒøœÅŒ≠œâœÇ (The Chronicle of Moreas), Athens 1940, page Œ∑' The difference of about one century between the Copenhagen and Parisian version shows a considerable number of linguistic differences due to the rapid evolution of the Greek language. The text of the Copenhagen version describes events until 1292. French text *Royal Library of Belgium No 15702 This text is known under the title: \\"The Book of the Conquest of Constantinople and the Empire of Roumania and the country of the Principality of Morea\\", since in the incipit, it is indicated \\"C'est le livre de la conqueste de Constantinople et de l'empire de Romanie, et dou pays de la princ√©e de la Mor√©e\\" Information in this text reaches until the year 1304. Italian text *Cronaca di Morea, is a summary that was compiled later than the previous texts and contains several mistakes. Its source is the text found in the Greek manuscript held in Turin. Aragonese text *Libro de los fechos et conquistas del principado de la Morea, was compiled at the end of the 14th century, in 1393, from the Greek version and other later sources, at the request of the Grand Master Jean Fernandez de Heredia of the Knights of St. John.Encyclopedic Dictionary, entry on \\"ŒßœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ ŒúœâœÅŒ≠œâœÇ\\", Eleftheroudakis ed., 1931 (in Greek) It covers events to 1393. Which text is the original? Which version came out first? It appears that the original text of the Chronicle of the Morea has been lost. Although the Aragonese and Italian texts have been clearly identified as later texts, there is no widely accepted consensus on the priority of the Greek or French text.M. Jeffreys, The Chronicle of the Morea: Priority of the Greek version, BZ 68 (1975) 304-350A. Panagiotis, Study Medieval Greek, Museum Tusculanum Press, 1992, Cyril A. Mango, The Oxford History of Byzantium, Oxford University Press, 2002, The Author The author of the original text of the chronicle appears to be a Franc or a gasmoule (a French-Greek, born from a mixed French-Greek marriage, the word seems to have an etymology from gar√ßon (boy) and mule). He appeared to admire the Franks (Crusaders) and have contempt of the local population and the Roman Empire. Notably, the author respects the citizenship of the Byzantine Greeks, calling them Romans (Œ°œâŒºŒ±·øñŒøŒπ) (especially in verses 1720-1738). The significance of the Chronicle The Chronicle is famous in spite of certain historical inaccuracies because of its lively description of life in the feudal community and because of the character of the language which reflects the rapid transition from Medieval to Modern Greek. Polet explains that since the author admired the Franks and had contempt for the Byzantine culture, the Chronicle of Morea did not become part of popular culture and history after the Franks left the Peloponnese. Numerous administrative laws and practices of the Principality of Achaia are mentioned in the Chronicle, making it a significant source on the Frankish period in Greece.P. Zepos, \\"Œ§Œø Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøŒΩ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒßœÅŒøŒΩŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ ŒúŒøœÅŒ≠œâœÇ (The Law in the Chronicle of the Morea)\\", ŒïœÄŒµœÑŒ∑œÅŒØœÇ ŒïœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒµŒØŒ±œÇ ŒíœÖŒ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒΩœéŒΩ Œ£œÄŒøœÖŒ¥œéŒΩ (Annals of the Society for Byzantine Studies) 18(1948), 202-220, in Greek Language of the Chronicle Since the year of the Fall of Constantinople, 1453, marks the symbolic boundary between Medieval and Modern Greek, the Chronicle of the Morea is generally classified under Medieval Greek.R.

Tonnet Histoire du grec mod√®rne, chapter ‚Äúla langue m√©dievale‚Äù )Kriaras in the Dictionary of Greek Medieval Vernacular Literature includes the Chronicle in his sources However, the Chronicle of the Morea, along with the Ptochoprodromic poems and acritic songs are considered as the beginnings of modern Greek literature. They are classified as part of both \\"Byzantine / medieval vernacular\\" and \\"(early) modern Greek\\" literature. N.

Satterfield has reprised the role in the form of a ghost through characters Miles Laurence and John McBain, several times in 2007. Austin Williams played a young Spencer in a 2008 storyline in which the characters Bo and Rex find themselves in 1968.One Life to Live recap (7/21/08) - ABC.com Character history Brilliant Dr. Spencer Truman comes to Llanview, Pennsylvania, in 2005; his younger brother David Vickers and ex-wife Dr. Paige Miller are inexplicably furious to have him back in their lives. In some way \\"wronged\\" by Spencer in the past, they are determined to find a way to keep him away from those they love and get him out of town. The somewhat sinister Spencer makes it clear he is not going anywhere. Spencer performs an operation on young Jack Manning that saves the boy's life; Spencer befriends Jack's mother Blair Cramer, and the two soon become romantically involved. Blair, however, is still emotionally wrapped up with her ex-husband, Todd Manning. Obsessed with winning Blair's love for himself, Spencer frames Todd for the murder of Margaret Cochran. Throughout Todd's grueling murder trial, Spencer finally makes Blair question Todd's innocence and seduces her. Todd is convicted of murder and sent to death row; he is actually executed and declared dead when Police Detective John McBain appears with the very much alive Margaret. Spencer manages to revive Todd. In addition to faking Margaret's death, Spencer had secretly delivered her son, whose biological father is Todd. Spencer blackmails Paige into helping him and keeping the secret. Spencer had murdered John and Dr. Michael McBain's father, Thomas McBain, 25 years earlier and had managed to convince both David and Paige that they had been complicit. Spencer puts Todd and Margaret's baby up for adoption, and the boy ends up with Michael McBain and his wife Marcie Walsh, who are unaware of his origins. Spencer's true motivation for returning to Llanview is revealed to be a vendetta against Asa Buchanan. David and Spencer's mother Emma Bradley-Truman had been one of Asa's wife Renee Divine's bordello girls, and on her deathbed had told Spencer that Asa is his biological father. Spencer vows destroy Asa's family piece by piece. Eventually, Blair catches on to Spencer's crimes, and after Todd's failed execution becomes determined to redeem herself in Todd's eyes and stop Spencer once and for all. She spies on Spencer, drugging him and recording their conversations in hopes that he will slip up and incriminate himself. Ultimately, Blair and John McBain succeed in getting Spencer jailed; he confronts Asa about his paternity, but the results of a DNA test showed that he is not Asa's son. Spencer seems to suffer a psychological breakdown. He makes an insanity plea, fooling court-appointed psychiatrist Marty Saybrooke into believing he is unfit to stand trial. A vengeful Todd abducts Spencer, determined to torture him to death, but ends up sending Spencer and Blair off a building rooftop by accident. While recuperating in the hospital in early 2007, Spencer descends deeper and deeper into his own private obsession, obsessing over Blair. One night he sneaks into Blair's nearby hospital room, drugging her and preparing to marry her, but is murdered during the attempt on January 26, 2007. The killer is ultimately revealed to be Lindsay Rappaport, who had killed Spencer to protect Marcie McBain, whom she loved like a daughter, from losing her adopted son Tommy should the truth come out that he is actually Todd's son. After Spencer's death, Miles Laurence -- younger brother of villain Mitch Laurence -- comes to town in February 2007. Miles had been a longtime patient of Spencer's, whose surgical genius had fixed Miles' grotesquely deformed facial features. The sheltered Miles, having lived his entire life in hospitals and institutions, believed Spencer to be his only friend. He listened to Spencer's posthumous messages and followed Spencer's instructions to take revenge on all of Spencer's enemies themselves. Miles has Todd assaulted and abducted, and he keeps the secret of Tommy McBain's paternity. After Miles' scheme to force Marty to become his wife falls apart, a remorseful Miles realizes the extent of Spencer's misdeeds and gives up Spencer's final secret, revealing to Blair that Tommy is Todd and Margaret's missing son.

The king was delighted; and he became intoxicated while drinking with Fu, who now took the king aside for a private word.

The band was labeled as part of the explosion of the new rave scene. Their songs are in both English and Portuguese. History 2003‚Äì06: Formation and Cansei de Ser Sexy (Brazilian album) CSS formed in September 2003, consisting of a group of friends. Their name was taken from a reported quote by Beyonc√©, who allegedly declared that she was \\"tired of being sexy\\". The band first garnered fame through the internet. Some of its members, like Adriano Cintra, and Wendi Bishop, had been previously known in S√£o Paulo's underground club scene, but not outside of the local alternative subculture. Others, like Lovefoxxx, were the owners of popular Fotolog and Flickr pages. Their collective band fotolog also gained popularity and their songs were frequently downloaded from Trama Virtual's website. Several songs by CSS were featured in mainstream media, for example \\"Meeting Paris Hilton\\" was featured in the Latin American broadcasting of The Simple Life, \\"Superafim\\" was used in the Brazilian version of Big Brother. Still unsigned, they released two independent EPs‚ÄîEm Rotterdam J√° √â uma Febre in 2004, and A Onda Mortal / Uma Tarde com PJ in January 2005‚Äîand played at the TIM Festival in 2004. In 2005, they signed with the Trama Virtual label, and in October their first album, Cansei de Ser Sexy, was released in Brazil, along with the seven-track EP CSS Suxxx, which was sold at concerts. A limited edition version of the album had a blank CD-R included, so the buyer could burn a copy of the album to give away as a gift. In Brazil, the album has reportedly sold 5,000 copies to date, but neither the album nor the singles have charted. Two music videos were also released, \\"Off the Hook\\" and \\"Alala\\", their two big hits, and were directed by guitar player Ana Rezende, and filmed at the home of band members Carolina Parra and Cintra, where CSS recorded most of their songs. 2006‚Äì08: Cansei de Ser Sexy (international album) In early 2006, CSS signed with Sub Pop to release their international debut album, Cansei de Ser Sexy. The first single was \\"Let's Make Love and Listen to Death From Above\\", released on June 6, with an accompanying video directed by Cat Solen. In July 2006, along with DJ Diplo and funk group Bonde do Rol√™, they began their first international tour. By 2007, CSS had sold as many as 60,000 copies in Europe and the United States. They played at various festivals across Europe in the summer of 2007. The band were also scheduled to play at the American festival Lollapalooza on August 4, 2007, but were left stranded at LaGuardia Airport en route to Chicago after an overbooking error. They did arrive in time for their performance at Virgin Festival in Baltimore the next day. CSS came to wider attention when their song \\"Music Is My Hot Hot Sex\\" was used in a worldwide television commercial by Apple Inc. for the iPod. Due to the song's exposure in the United States, it charted at number 63 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the highest- charting single in the United States by a Brazilian band to date. Coincidentally, the same song had been used in a promotion for the competing Zune media player a year prior. Several of CSS's songs feature on the soundtracks of video games. Their singles \\"Alala\\" and \\"Off the Hook\\" were featured in the video game Forza Motorsport 2. The video game FIFA 08 also features \\"Off the Hook\\". In April 2008, Iracema Trevisan left the band; Cintra replaced her on bass guitar. The band subsequently worked with a session drummer, Jon Harper of the Cooper Temple Clause. 2008‚Äì10: Donkey \\"Rat Is Dead (Rage)\\", the first single to be taken from their second album, was made available as a free download from the CSS website in April 2008. The album, Donkey, was released on July 21, 2008, with first single proper, \\"Left Behind\\", having been released earlier in the month. Their song \\"Jager Yoga\\" features in the soundtrack of video game FIFA 09, and \\"Rat Is Dead (Rage)\\" appears in the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles. 2010‚Äì13: La Liberaci√≥n and Planta CSS recorded tracks for their third studio album, La Liberaci√≥n, while touring. They reportedly recorded a song in Spanish titled \\"¬°Ay, Qu√© Horror!\\" In an interview with MTV Brasil, lead singer Lovefoxxx stated that the first single of the new album would be released in May 2011. The album, also according to her, would be released in August 2011, with eleven tracks. The title would also be in Spanish. In an April 2011 interview with Folha de S.Paulo, Adriano Cintra said that the band's third album \\"is not a themed album. It has influences from clubs, reggae and punk.\\" Ana Rezende, however, said that \\"we sometimes do a reggae that nobody thinks it's actually reggae. But in our head is very reggae.\\" The single \\"Hits Me Like a Rock\\" from the band's third album featured on the soundtrack of the video game FIFA 12. On November 11, 2011, Adriano Cintra announced that he had left CSS and declared that he did not authorize any of the band members to use his songs in any of their forthcoming concerts. He also stated that the reason behind his departure was due to attitude problems from other band members, claiming that they had let fame go to their heads. It was also reported that the band members' musical incompetence was also a factor. In an interview with Rolling Stone Brazil, Cintra said that his bandmates' unwillingness and inability to collaborate on the recording of the band's third album led him to leave the band, a decision which the band's manager was able to revert by asking him to stay. Then, during the European tour Cintra was diagnosed with a repetitive strain injury in his hand, which made him unable to continue with the tour. Nevertheless, as over half of the band's songs include backing tracks of Cintra playing, he expected to get paid for their use, which was agreed by the band's manager. In spite of this agreement, on the eve of the payday Cintra received an email from the band's manager informing him that the remaining members of the band thought that he did not need to be paid his share, as he did not tour and he had other forms of income. That, according to Cintra, was the last straw. On July 3, 2012, Adriano Cintra gave an interview on Madrid, his latest musical project, where he stated regarding his CSS departure that he was fed up with his bandmates, who were frustrating to work with as they couldn't even play their own instruments. CSS was not seriously deterred by Cintra's departure, playing the SOS Festival in Murcia, Spain on May 5, 2012 and the Ballroom Marfa 2012 Benefit Weekend in Marfa, Texas on May 27, 2012, performing several of their old songs. J.R. Kurtz has been the band's touring drummer since 2010 with the addition of Nate Perry as touring bassist beginning in late 2011. Bassist Inge Johansson has also toured with the band. CSS' fourth album, named Planta, was released on June 5, 2013 in Japan, June 10 in the UK and June 11 in the US. The record is their first album since the departure of multi-instrumentalist Adriano Cintra. The first single is \\"Hangover\\".

It is approximately south of Colombo and north of Galle. Bentota is situated on the southern bank of the Bentota River mouth, at an elevation of above the sea level. The name of the town is derived from a mythical story which claims a demon named 'Bem' ruled the tota or river bank. Economy Bentota is a tourist attraction, with a local airport (Bentota River Airport) and a handful of world-class hotels. It is a destination for watersports. Bentota also delivers an ancient art of healing called Ayurveda. Bentota is famous for its toddy production, an alcoholic beverage made out of coconut nectar. It also has a turtle hatchery, located on Induruwa beach. History Bentota is a historical place described in ancient messenger poems (sande≈õa kƒÅvya). The Galapatha Viharaya is one of a cluster of five ancient temples in the region. In the 17th Century the Portuguese built a small fort at the mouth of the Bentota River (Bentara Ganga), which in Sinhala was called Parangi Kotuwa, meaning the fort of the Portuguese. The river marked the southern extremity of Portuguese held territory in Sri Lanka. The Dutch subsequently allowed the fort to fall into disrepair, converting one of the large buildings within the fort into a colonial rest house for Dutch Officers travelling between Colombo and Galle. The British subsequently converted the rest house into a coastal sanatorium. Sir James Emerson Tennent (1804-1869), the colonial secretary of Ceylon (1845-1850) in his book, Ceylon, An Account of the Island (1859), stated that the rest house at Bentota, situated within a little park, deeply shaded by lofty Tamarind trees on the point of the beach where the river forms its junction with the sea, is one of the coolest and most agreeable in Ceylon. The British introduced the railway in the early 19th century, mainly to transport the coconut produce from the deep south to the capital, building a permanent bridge (Bentota Palama) to cross the river. Transport Bentota is located on the Coastal or Southern Rail Line (connecting Colombo through to Matara), though Bentota Halt is only a small railway station with most trains stopping at Aluthgama, north of Bentota. It is located on the A2 highway, connecting Colombo to Wellawaya, about south of Beruwala. Access is possible from the Southern Expressway Welipenna exit and only 10 km from the exit. Helicopters fly shuttle services on charter basis.

Kaplan (February 16, 1924 ‚Äì September 3, 2009) was an American psychologist. She was a pioneer of neuropsychological tests and did most of her work at the Boston VA Hospital. Kaplan is known for her promotion of clinical neuropsychology as a specialty area in psychology. She examined brain-behavioral relationships in aphasia, apraxia, developmental issues in clinical neuropsychology, as well as normal and abnormal aging. Kaplan helped develop a new method of assessing brain function with neuropsychological assessment, called \\"The Boston Process Approach.\\" As a graduate student Kaplan worked with Heinz Werner, and then collaborated further with Norman Geschwind and Harold Goodglass. Personal history Kaplan was born in Brooklyn, New York. She earned her bachelor's degree at Brooklyn College, then did her graduate work at Clark University in Worcester, with a dissertation focusing on the development of word meanings and apraxia in children. Kaplan was a Professor in the departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, and in the Behavioral Neuroscience Ph.D. Program at Boston University School of Medicine at the time of her death. Kaplan was also Professor of Psychology at Suffolk University and Affiliate Professor of Psychology at Clark University. She was also a member of the Psychology Department at the Baycrest Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Mentorship Kaplan was a leader in developing education and training of neuropsychologists. From 1976 to 1987, Kaplan was the director of Clinical Neuropsychological Services at the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center where she was responsible for the development of pre- and post-doctoral clinical neuropsychological internship training program. Later, at Suffolk University, Boston University School of Medicine, and Tewksbury Hospital, she continued this work. She also did philanthropic work with the National Head Injury Foundation and the World Health Organization. Clinical contributions Kaplan made important contributions to clinical neuropsychological assessment. Her observations and assessment methods evolved into a philosophical school of neuropsychological assessment, called by most people the \\"Boston Process Approach.\\" A process approach to neuropsychological assessment. Clinical neuropsychology and brain function: Research, measurement, and practice. Kaplan, Edith Boll, Thomas (Ed); Bryant, Brenda K. (Ed). (1988). Clinical neuropsychology and brain function: Research, measurement, and practice. The Master lecture series, Vol. 7. (pp. 127-167). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. 202 pp. Kaplan also re-purposed intelligence tests such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale as tools to localize functional deficits in the brain (whether developmental or due to lesions). Prior to the introduction of the process-oriented approach, clinical neuropsychological assessment followed a fixed-battery global-achievement approach, and stressed quantitative interpretation of test results (for example the Halstead-Reitan battery). The process-oriented approach offered advances in test interpretation, stressing the qualitative aspects of patients' performance profiles. The Boston Process Approach examines the qualitative process by which the patient solves a problem rather than simply looking at the patient's quantitative numerical scores. The Boston Process also tailors which tests to give a patient instead of administering an entire test battery to every subject, regardless of their condition. This alternative approach improved clinical understanding of brain functions and generated discussion about diagnostic issues in clinical neuropsychology. Kaplan developed and co-authored The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination, The Boston Naming Test, The Boston Stimulus Board, The California Verbal Learning Test (Adult and Children's Versions), Microcog: A Computerized Assessment of Cognitive Status, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Revised, as a Neuropsychological Instrument (WAIS-R-NI), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - III, as a Neuropsychological Instrument (WISC-III-NI), The Baycrest Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, and The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS), a refined and expanded selection of tasks from the widely used Halstead-Reitan battery. She also contributed analytical methods for clock drawings as neuropsychological assessment tools, especially regarding spatial neglect and attention. Kaplan also contributed a body of research, including (with Norman Geschwind) the first paper on cerebral disconnection syndrome. She also investigated Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, dementia, and other neuropsychological disorders. Professional achievements and awards Kaplan was one of the founders of the American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology and was among the first to be awarded the Diplomat in Clinical Neuropsychology. Kaplan was president of the International Neuropsychological Society, president of the Clinical Neuropsychology Division of the American Psychological Association (Division 40), and president of the Boston Neuropsychological Foundation, which she co-founded in 1983. She received many awards, including The National Academy of Neuropsychology Distinguished Clinical Neuropsychologist Award in 1993, The Edith Kaplan Neuroscience Scholarship Fund in 1994, and The New England Psychological Association first annual Distinguished Contributions Award in 1996. She also won The Massachusetts Psychological Association Career Contribution Award in 1998 and The Massachusetts Neuropsychological Society Career Contribution Award in 1999. Kaplan had one son.

Early life The stuffed skin of Martha in 1921 The history of the Cincinnati Zoo's passenger pigeons has been described by Arlie William Schorger in his monograph on the species as \\"hopelessly confused,\\" and he also said that it is \\"difficult to find a more garbled history\\" than that of Martha. The generally accepted version is that, by the turn of the 20th century, the last known group of passenger pigeons was kept by Professor Charles Otis Whitman at the University of Chicago. Whitman originally acquired his passenger pigeons from David Whittaker of Wisconsin, who sent him six birds, two of which later bred and hatched Martha in about 1885. Martha was named in honor of Martha Washington. Whitman kept these pigeons to study their behavior, along with rock doves and Eurasian collared-doves. Whitman and the Cincinnati Zoo, recognizing the decline of the wild populations, attempted to consistently breed the surviving birds, including attempts at making a rock dove foster passenger pigeon eggs. These attempts were unsuccessful, and Whitman sent Martha to the Cincinnati Zoo in 1902. However, other sources argue that Martha was instead the descendant of three pairs of passenger pigeons purchased by the Cincinnati Zoo in 1877. Another source claimed that when the Cincinnati Zoo opened in 1875, it already had 22 birds in its collection. These sources claim that Martha was hatched at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1885, and that the passenger pigeons were originally kept not because of the rarity of the species, but to enable guests to have a closer look at a native species. Cincinnati Zoo By November 1907, Martha and her two male companions at the Cincinnati Zoo were the only known surviving passenger pigeons after four captive males in Milwaukee died during the winter. One of the Cincinnati males died in April 1909, followed by the remaining male on July 10, 1910. Martha soon became a celebrity due to her status as an endling, and offers of a $1000 reward for finding a mate for Martha brought even more visitors to see her. Several years before her death Martha suffered an apoplectic stroke, leaving her weakened; the zoo built a lower roost for her as she could no longer reach her old one. Martha died at 1 p.m. on September 1, 1914 of old age. Her body was found lifeless on her cage's floor. Depending on the source, Martha was between 17‚Äì29 years old at the time of her death, although 29 is the generally accepted figure. After death Martha after being skinned After her death, Martha was quickly brought to the Cincinnati Ice Company, where she was held by her feet and frozen into a block of ice. She was then sent by express train to the Smithsonian, where she arrived on September 4, 1914, and was photographed. She had been molting when she died, and as such she was missing several feathers, including some of her longer tail feathers. William PalmerWilliam Palmer (1856‚Äì1921) was a English-born American naturalist, the chief taxidermist for the National Museum of Natural History, and an ornithologist who participated in several noteworthy expeditions. Gerrit Smith Miller described Palmer's research on bats. skinned Martha while Nelson R. Wood mounted her skin. Her internal parts were dissected by Robert Wilson Shufeldt and are also preserved and kept by the National Museum of Natural History. Martha in 2015 Martha's 1956 display at the Smithsonian Institution From the 1920s through the early 1950s she was displayed in the National Museum of Natural History's Bird Hall, placed on a small branch fastened to a block of Styrofoam and paired with a male passenger pigeon that had been shot in Minnesota in 1873. She was then displayed as part of the Birds of the World exhibit that ran from 1956 to 1999. During this time she left the Smithsonian twice‚Äîin 1966 to be displayed at the Zoological Society of San Diego's Golden Jubilee Conservation Conference, and in June 1974 to the Cincinnati Zoo for the dedication of the Passenger Pigeon Memorial. When the Smithsonian shut down its Birds of the World exhibit, Martha was removed from display and kept in a special exhibit at the Cincinnati Zoo. Martha was back on display in the Smithsonian from June 2014 to September 2015 for the exhibit Once There Were Billions. Cultural significance Martha has become a symbol of the threat of extinction. She was used at the Zoological Society of San Diego's 1966 Golden Jubilee Conservation Conference as a mascot to emphasize the need for conservation. A Harvard historian has described Martha's remains as \\"an organic monument, biologically continuous with the living bird she commemorates, the embodiment of extinction itself.\\" Many authors writing about extinction have made what one described as a \\"strange pilgrimage\\" to see her remains. John Herald, a bluegrass singer, wrote a song dedicated to Martha and the extinction of the passenger pigeon that he titled \\"Martha (Last of the Passenger Pigeons)\\". In 2019, Colorado author Greg Benchwick, published a children's chapter book about Martha.

Location Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is situated midway between Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford but is in the LS27 (Leeds) postcode area while the village telephone numbers are \\"0113\\", the Leeds prefix. Gildersome was an urban district, established in 1894. In 1937 it was absorbed into the Municipal Borough of Morley. In 1974 the borough was abolished and combined with neighbouring authorities in the City of Leeds. Although the village is still classed as part of the Morley urban area in the census, it is technically separate, and is not governed by Morley Town Council. In 2004 a civil parish was established and the village now has a parish council. At the 2011 Census the population of this civil parish was 5,804. Gildersome is sits in the Morley North ward, which elects three councillors to Leeds City Council, and the Morley and Outwood parliamentary constituency. Gildersome is one of the highest parts of the Leeds district area at 561 feet above sea level (Hart Hill). The M621 motorway begins at M62 motorway junction 27 which is Gildersome. The A62 Leeds to Huddersfield (Gelderd Road) also runs by the village. Amenities Gildersome has many services such as a library, doctor's, fast food restaurants, laundrette and a small Co-op store. A playground sits next to the library. A war memorial is situated on the village green. Perhaps slightly unusual for a village of its size, it has always had a number of schools, right through its history. At present, there are two primary schools; Gildersome Primary and Birchfield Primary. The schools are both feeder schools to a range of high schools in the area, as the village is allocated centrally between the likes of The Farnley Academy and the Morley schools, Bruntcliffe Academy and The Morley Academy. Gildersome has a largely sporting community, especially within football and cricket sectors. The village team, Gildersome Spurs, trains and plays teams in football from an early age, and holds an annual gala. The cricket club, located at the top of Street Lane, has been successfully operating for decades. In 2007, they broke records, when their junior team played four matches, one in each country in the space of 12 hours, a feat which was recorded by local and national media. In September 2007 Gildersome entered rugby league with a team playing in the CMS Yorkshire league Division 4. Etymology The name of Gildersome is first attested in 1181, as Gildehusum. The research of the English Place-Name Society established that the name derives from the Old Norse words gildi ('banquet, tax, guild') and h√∫sum ('houses', the dative plural form of h√∫s, 'house). Thus the name once meant 'guild-houses'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place- Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017). This etymology supersedes older guesses, including the 1913 opinion of Armitage Goodall that the first element was the archaic northern English dialect word gill ('stream, ravine, narrow valley'),Armitage Goodall, Place- Names of South-West Yorkshire; That Is of So Much of the West Riding As Lies South of the Aire from Keighley Onwards; 2013 [first published 1913]. London, Forgotten Books, pp. 144‚Äì45. and the earlier idea that Gildersome derived from a Dutch place name such as *Guelderzoom referring to immigrants from Guelderland.. History Old Griffin Head New Inn The first church in the village, Gildersome Baptist Church was constructed in 1707. It was built for public worship with an intended capacity of 250 people. In 2007 there were many celebrations and events to coincide with the 300th anniversary of the original place of worship. In 1866, for a cost of approximately ¬£2,000, a new chapel was built, much larger than the original. It was opened on 2 May 1866, and the original building remains. However, in recent years, the church was redeveloped, with the adjoining halls and facilities being converted into flats. The original hall was renovated, with a new and modern interior and brand new facilities. Through grants, volunteering schemes and assistance from various sources, the graveyard has also been converted into a community garden, which encourages local school children to learn more about the environment and nature. Turton Hall in Gildersome (now three residential dwellings) was a prominent and wealthy school, for higher education pupils, during the 1700s. It is said that preacher John Wesley visited and preached in the dining room. The hall returned to private ownership in 1879, and remains a Grade II listed building, with several TPOs (tree preservation orders) covering the grounds. Gildersome also used to have two fully functioning railway stations. One was on the Great Northern Railway line from Wakefield to Bradford which ran at the turn of the 20th century, and it was located at the crossroads at the top of the village (towards Morley). This station closed in 1962 along with railway station In the recent roundabout replacements a tunnel on the GNR line was uncovered and then resealed. The second railway station was on Rooms Lane and was on the Leeds to Huddersfield LNWR \\"Leeds New Line\\" opened in 1900. This station closed in 1923 to passengers. Gildersome has changed beyond recognition in 100 years, when the village was a thriving mining community with many local pits. A lot of the original mining locations remain, such as the 'brownhills', a large area of land which separates Gildersome from neighbouring Drighlington. The provisions created for the miners, including the increased number of housing remain today, including the town houses and terraces built on Street Lane. A lot of the land has subsequently been redeveloped. The land on which Mill Lane and its subsequent housing now sits was, as the name suggests, a large industrial area, with Maiden Mills built on the site. Originally, there was a flax mill, but during an incident in 1914, the mill burnt down, and a new one was built. On 4 February 1974, the village and surrounding area gathered widespread national attention, as result of the M62 coach bombing: 12 people including soldiers and members of their families, died in the incident, which the media claimed to be the work of the IRA. In the 1990s, much former industrial land in Gildersome was cleared and re-developed for housing.  Trivia  Housing in Gildersome * Gildersome Primary School's emblem which is placed on the uniforms and school-related products, is a phoenix. The school was initially built in 1984, to educate the pupils of the merging Gildersome Junior School and St Peter's Infant School, allowing children to be taught from reception age, through to 11. However the philosophy behind the phoenix comes from the fact that both schools suffered terrible fires, in the '70s and '80s. The new school was seen as a new beginning, and the phoenix was chosen as an emblem, which remains to this date. A revised edition was designed in 2003, for multimedia purposes. *During the war years, on the land on which the Green Park sits, at the bottom of the Gildersome Primary drive, there was a public air-raid shelter. *Winston Churchill once made a visit to the village, stopping on the boundary between Leeds (city centre) and Morley, where he \\"meeted and greeted\\" people near St Bernard's (now on Gelderd Road) *Gildersome gained national widespread attention in 1663, when a foiled plot aimed at taking over the city of Leeds, and other strongholds in the Yorkshire area came to the attention of the public. It is now commonly known as the Farnley Wood Plot, but many of the conspirators came from the Gildersome area. In conjunction with this plot, many people were arrested and held captive at York. Three who managed to escape were brought back to Leeds for immediate execution. Some people go as far to say, that the land on which one of the plotter's house used to stand, along with the original plantains, is now haunted. *Mary Irvine Thompson (1919‚Äì2001), first female chartered engineer to be admitted to the Institution of Structural Engineers (1947), started her school education in Gildersome.Electoral register 1921 for her parents William and Annie Irvine, living at West End, Gildersome.

He coached Australia at the Rugby World Cup, and the Waratahs, Brumbies and Rebels in the Super Rugby competition. Career One of Macqueen's first major coaching positions was at the Waratahs, where he was present from 1991 to 1992. In 1992 he was also a selector for the Australian team. He went on to coach the Australian XV in 1995 and again acted as a selector 1994‚Äì95. Following the inception of Super 12, Macqueen became the coach of the Brumbies. Macqueen was appointed the head coach of the Wallabies in September 1997, and would coach them until 2001. He led the Wallabies to victory at the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales, where they defeated France in the final, becoming the first nation to ever win the World Cup twice. The following year Australia won the Tri Nations Series for the first time. He retired from the game after guiding the Wallabies to a victory over the highly rated 2001 Lions side captained by Martin Johnson. He finished his career as the Australian coach with a test match winning record of just below 80%.

It formed on October 16 in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave, and strengthened to reach peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) before striking Cuba. It later moved slowly through the Bahamas before weakening to tropical depression status. On October 24, with the assistance of a cold front off the coast of the eastern United States, Gilda transformed into a subtropical storm, becoming very large and strong. The storm later accelerated northeastward and became extratropical, ultimately dissipating near Greenland. The storm first brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, causing six deaths and some damage from mudslides. While crossing Cuba and later the Bahamas, the storm caused little impact, limited to some crop damage. As a subtropical storm, Gilda brought gusty winds and high waves to much of the east coast of the United States, causing minor beach erosion and coastal property damage. Storm history A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on October 3\\\\. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October 10\\\\. By October 13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and over the next few days the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October 15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica. The initial motion of the depression was uncertain, as steering currents could have resulted in a motion either to the west or to the north-northeast. With the possibility of the western track, the storm was remarked as being the first serious hurricane threat for southern Florida since Hurricane Gladys in 1968. However, after formation the depression moved slowly north-northeastward. The thunderstorm activity gradually became better organized while rainbands increased around the circulation. By 0000 UTC on October 18, the depression attained tropical storm status about 100 mi (160 km) northwest of the Cayman Islands, after which it was named Gilda by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The storm quickly strengthened as it moved toward southern Cuba, reaching peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) about 18 hours after reaching tropical storm status. Shortly thereafter, Gilda made landfall near the border of the present day Cuban provinces of Sancti Sp√≠ritus and Ciego de √Åvila. Tropical Storm Gilda weakened slightly over Cuba, crossing the island in less than twelve hours before emerging into the Atlantic Ocean early on October 19. At the time, the anticyclone over Jamaica which previously assisted the cyclone instead remained over the Caribbean, which increased shear over the storm. This caused the convection to gradually separate from the low-level circulation. Early on October 20, Gilda passed just southeast of Andros Island in the Bahamas, around the same time that the Hurricane Hunters recorded an atmospheric pressure of 994 mbar; this was the lowest recorded pressure in association with Gilda while it was a tropical cyclone. It gradually weakened due to the wind shear, resulting in the low-level steering currents becoming dominant. After moving through the Exuma island chain, the storm passed near or over Eleuthera, and late on October 21 Gilda became nearly stationary about 60 mi (95 km/h) east of Harbour Island. Late on October 22, after moving only about 6 mi (10 km) in a 24‚Äëhour period, Gilda weakened to a tropical depression. Now a tropical depression, Gilda remained nearly stationary for another 24 hours before accelerating northeastward, under the influence of an upper-level trough exiting the east coast of the United States. Cold air from the trough interacted with Gilda, providing a baroclinic environment for intensifying, and on October 24 the storm transitioned into a subtropical storm about halfway between Hispaniola and North Carolina. This made Gilda the first tropical storm on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. Operationally, tropical storm advisories were still issued on Gilda while it was subtropical, due to the need to maintain consistency and the possibility it could again become tropical. The circulation of the storm became very large, at one point stretching from New England to the Bahamas, and eastward beyond Bermuda, or a diameter of more than 1300 mi (2100 km). On October 25, Gilda passed about halfway between Bermuda and Cape Hatteras, when it reached peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Subsequently it turned northeastward, and on October 27 attained a minimum pressure of 984 mbar, the lowest of its duration while tropical or subtropical. Later that day, Gilda became an extratropical cyclone southeast of the Canadian Maritimes as it moved over colder waters. After passing just southeast of Newfoundland, the storm continued northeastward, becoming nearly stationary off the coast of Greenland before dissipating on October 30. Preparations, impact, and records Gilda as a subtropical storm near the United States Tropical Storm Gilda first affected Jamaica, bringing heavy rainfall in a three-day period. The highest amount measured in a 24‚Äëhour period within Jamaica was , which triggered many landslides across eastern sections of the island. The rains produced landslides, particularly in Saint Andrew Parish where six houses were destroyed. Elsewhere on the island, the mudslides caused further property damage and left some roads unpassable. Six people were killed throughout the country. The storm did not have significant impact in Cuba. A station in the mountains of what was then known as Oriente Province recorded winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The city of Mor√≥n, located along the northern coast of Cuba, recorded 6.13 inches (155 mm) of rainfall in the 6 hour period prior to the storm passing the area. Damage was minor, limited to some crop damage in the eastern portion of the island, as well as power outages. The threat of the storm forced several thousand people to leave their homes. In the Bahamas, officials closed schools, and many businesses closed early on the day the storm moved through the country. The storm's stationary motion caused several days of high tides and heavy rains. Tropical storm force wind gusts were reported on Andros Island, and gusts peaked at 75 mph (120 km/h) on Golden Cay. Gilda's passage left crop damage on several islands, although monetary losses in the country were minor. When Gilda was forecast to move near southeastern Florida, gale warnings were issued from North Key Largo to Fort Lauderdale. Rough seas affected the Florida coastline for about 72 hours, causing moderate coastal property damage and beach erosion. After becoming a large subtropical cyclone, gale warnings were issued at various times from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina to the mouth of the Merrimack River in Massachusetts. High surf and minor beach erosion were reported along the coastline, and gale force winds were observed from North Carolina to New Jersey. Over the western Atlantic Ocean, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas. One ship reported a wave height of 28 ft (8.5 m), though no significant marine losses were reported. Around the time of it becoming extratropical, Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia recorded a wind gust of 74 mph (119 km/h). Tropical Storm Gilda was notable as being the first observed tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone; several subtropical cyclones have undergone tropical cyclogenesis, but never the opposite. Since Gilda, a few other storms accomplished the feat. In 1980, a tropical depression dissipated, reformed as a subtropical depression, and later became Hurricane Georges over the open Atlantic Ocean. The next year, Tropical Storm Jose became subtropical near the end of its duration, and in 1984, Hurricane Klaus became a subtropical storm over the western Atlantic Ocean. In 2001, Tropical Storm Allison, after causing devastating flooding in Texas, became a subtropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico and moved across much of the southeastern United States. In 2011, Tropical Storm Lee transitioned into a subtropical storm while approaching Louisiana.

It addresses the economic aspect of the regional problems that are spatially analyzable so that theoretical or policy implications can be derived with respect to regions whose geographical scope ranges from local to global areas. Origins Regional economics has shared many traditions with regional science, whose earlier development was propelled by Walter Isard and some economists' dissatisfaction with the existing regional economic analysis. Despite such a rather critical view of regional economics, however, it is hard to be denied that the \\"economic\\" approach to regional problems was and has been the most significant one throughout the development of regional science. As a sub-discipline of economics, it has also developed its independent traditions and approaches that conform with the subject matter or perspective of economics. Location theory, that had been separately developed in Germany and North America in the early 20th century, and the theory of external economies from \\"localized industries\\" (as described in Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics (1890)) formed the theoretical basis of regional economics, which has played a central role in regional science. As the preface and the contents of August L√∂sch's Die r√§umliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft (Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1940; 2nd ed., 1944), whose English translation was made in 1954 by W. H. Woglom under the title of The Economics of Location, consistently showed, economic approach to (industrial and consumer) locations has been central in both regional economics and regional science. Harold Hotelling's spatial approach to economic competition, which was introduced in The Economic Journal in 1929 under the title of \\"Stability in Competition,\\" and Edgar M. Hoover's Location Theory and the Shoe and Leather Industries (1937) and The Location of Economic Activity (1948) were United States scholars' representative contribution to theorizing and empirically verifying the regional problems from the viewpoint of economics. In his seminal paper, \\"Increasing Returns and Economic Geography,\\" Journal of Political Economy, Paul Krugman (1991: 498) emphasized the importance of economic geography and regional economics for enriching economics concluding it with his statement of scholarly hope as follows: \\"Thus I hope that this paper will be a stimulus to a revival of research into regional economics and economic geography.\\" Definition Vinod Dubey (1964) summarized the following four approaches to define regional economics. The first approach is \\"to deny the possibility of isolating such a discipline.\\" According to Vinod Dubey (1964), Harvey Stephen Perloff, who co-authored State and Local Finance in the National Economy (with Alvin Harvey Hansen) and Regions, Resources, and Economic Growth (with Edgar S. Dunn, Jr., Eric E. Lampard, and Richard F. Muth), denied the possibility for any break-up of regional studies or regional science into \\"parts parallel to the disciplines employed.\\" The second approach is to conform with the definition of Lionel Charles Robbins (1932: 15), stated as \\"Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses,\\" for the economic problems occurring in regions. The third approach is to define regional economics as a sub-discipline of economics that addresses spatial general equilibrium. This approach was emphasized by L. Lefeber and H. O. Nourse. The fourth approach is to define it as a sub- discipline of economics that addresses immobile resources. This view was supported by G. H. Borts (1960), J. L. Stein (1961), and J. R. Meyer (1963). In his Regional Economic Growth (1969), Horst Siebert viewed regional economics as the study of humans' economic behavior in space. Drawing from the definition of regional economics as the system of the scholarly answers to the question \\"What is where, and why--and so what?\\" in An Introduction to Regional Economics (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1971; 3rd ed., 1984) by Edgar M. Hoover and Frank Giarratanai, and from Dubey's (1964: 29) definition of regional economics as \\"the study of differentiation and interrelationships of areas in a universe of unevenly distributed and imperfectly mobile resources with particular emphasis in application on the planning of the social overhead capital investments to mitigate the social problems by these circumstances,\\" it is definable as the study of the systems of how (much) and where to produce and redistribute what using scarce resources or public goods.

The Lieven family (; ) is one of the oldest aristocratic families of Baltic Germans. Caupo's grandson, Nicholas, was the first to spell his name Lieven. History They claim descent from Caupo of Turaida (Latvian, Kaupo), the Livonian quasi rex who converted to Christianity in 1186, when Bishop Meinhard attempted to Christianize the region. Henrici Chronicon Lyvoniae tells that, in winter 1203‚Äì1204, Caupo went to Rome with Theodoric, a Cistercian Monk (who was to become the founder of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, then the first bishop of Estonia). They were received by the Pope Innocent III who backed up their plans to Christianize Livonia. According to feudal records, the Lieven ancestor Gerardus Lƒ´vo (1269) and his son Johannes (1296) entered service as vassals to the Archbishop of Rƒ´ga. One of Caupo's daughters married an ancestor of the barons, then Counts of Ungern-Sternberg. Family members Charlotte, First Princess Lieven Dorothea von Lieven *Reinhold Liewen, the Swedish governor of Oesel (Saaremaa), in 1653 was made a baron together with his brother, whose son Lieutenant-General Baron Hans Heinrich von Liewen accompanied Charles XII in all his campaigns and expeditions. Among Reinhold's descendants, one branch settled in Courland and was recognized in 1801 as in the Holy Roman Empire. *Johann-Christoph von Lieven was the first member of the family to gain distinction in the Russian service: he served as Governor of Arkhangelsk under Catherine the Great and as General of Infantry under Emperor Paul. *Baron Otto Heinrich von Lieven (1726‚Äì1781) married in 1766 Baroness Charlotte von Gaugreben (1743‚Äì1828), who was entrusted by Emperor Paul with the task of educating his daughters and younger sons, Nicholas and Mikhail Pavlovich. In recognition of her services Paul made her a countess in 1799. When her pupil Nicholas became the Emperor of Russia in 1826, the 84-year-old governess was made a Princess with the title of Her Serene Highness. The title was hereditary and passed to her descendants, of which the following were notable. *Her son, Prince Christoph Heinrich von Lieven (1774‚Äì1838), accompanied Alexander I of Russia during the Battle of Austerlitz and at the signing of the Peace of Tilsit. In 1809 he was sent to represent Russia at the Prussian court and, in the crisis of the Napoleonic Wars in 1812, was transferred to London as the Minister Plenipotentiary to the court of St. James's, a post which he kept for 22 years. Somewhat overshadowed by his more illustrious wife, Dorothea von Lieven (n√©e von Benckendorff), Prince Lieven took part in the Congress of Vienna and died in Rome when he accompanied the future Alexander II of Russia on his Grand Tour. *His elder brother, Prince Carl Christoph von Lieven (1767‚Äì1844), started his career as an aide-de-camp to Prince Potemkin, administered the garrison of Arkhangelsk under Paul and ended his career as Imperial Minister of Education (1828‚Äì33). *Prince Alexander Friedrich von Lieven (1801‚Äì1880), son of the preceding, Major-General, served as Governor of Taganrog in 1844‚Äì1853, and senator 1853‚Äì1880. *Prince Andrey Alexandrovich Lieven (1839‚Äì1913), his son, was the Senator and Minister of State Properties in 1877‚Äì81. *Jelena Lieven (1842‚Äì1917), Imperial Russian pedagogue, sister of the above. *Prince Alexander Karl Nikolai von Lieven (1860-1914), was an admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy: in 1878 entered in service; in 1911 was appointed chief of the naval general staff. *Prince Anatol Leonid von Lieven (1872‚Äì1937) commanded a Russo-German battle group in Latvia; Lieven forbade his men to fight the Estonian Army in Vidzeme, unlike the rest of the Baltische Landeswehr.

Although several species of sixgill stingrays have been described historically, they may represent variations in a single, widespread species. This flabby, heavy-bodied fish, described only in 1980, is unique among rays in having six pairs of gill slits rather than five. Growing up to long, it has a rounded pectoral fin disc and a long, triangular, and flexible snout filled with a gelatinous substance. It is brownish above and white below, and lacks dermal denticles. Benthic in nature, the sixgill stingray is usually found over upper continental slopes and seamounts at depths of . It has been recorded from scattered locations in the Indo-Pacific from South Africa to Hawaii. This species probably uses its snout to probe for food in the bottom sediment. Its jaws are greatly protrusible, allowing it to capture buried prey. The sixgill stingray gives live birth, with litters of two to five pups. The IUCN has assessed this ray as Least Concern, because it faces minimal fishing pressure across most of its range. Taxonomy and phylogeny The first known sixgill stingray, an intact female across, was found on a beach near Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It was described as a new species and placed in its own family by Phillip Heemstra and Margaret Smith, in a 1980 article for the Ichthyological Bulletin of the J. L. B. Smith Institute of Ichthyology. The generic name Hexatrygon is derived from the Greek hexa (\\"six\\") and trygon (\\"stingray\\"), referring to the number of gill slits. The specific name bickelli honors Dave Bickell, a journalist who discovered the original specimen. Following the description of H. bickelli, four additional species of sixgill stingray were described on the basis of morphological differences. However, their validity was brought into question after comparative studies revealed that traits such as snout shape, body proportions, and tooth number vary greatly with age and among individuals. Taxonomists therefore concluded tentatively that there is only a single species of sixgill stingray, though genetic analysis is needed to determine whether this is truly the case. Phylogenetic studies using morphological and genetic data have generally concurred that the sixgill stingray is the most basal member of the stingray lineage. An extinct relative, H. senegasi, lived during the Middle Eocene (49‚Äì37 million years ago). Description The sixgill stingray has a bulky, flabby body with a rounded pectoral fin disc that is longer than wide. The triangular snout is much longer in adults than in juveniles (making up almost two-fifths of the disc length), and is filled with a clear gelatinous material; because of this, the snout of a dead specimen can shrink significantly when exposed to air or preservatives. The tiny eyes are placed far apart and well ahead of the larger spiracles. Between the widely spaced nostrils are a pair of short and fleshy flaps that are joined in the middle to form a curtain of skin. The mouth is wide and nearly straight. In either jaw are 44‚Äì102 rows of small, blunt teeth arranged in a quincunx pattern; the teeth are more numerous in adults. Six pairs of small gill slits occur on the underside of the disc; all other rays have five pairs (a few sharks also have six or more pairs of gill slits, for example in the genus Hexanchus). One recorded specimen had six gill slits on the left side and seven on the right. Their pelvic fins are rather large and rounded. The tail is moderately thick and measures about 0.5‚Äì0.7 times as long as the disc. One or two serrated stinging spines are present on its dorsal surface, well back from the base. The end of the tail bears a long, low leaf- shaped caudal fin that is nearly symmetrical above and below. The skin is delicate and entirely lacking dermal denticles. The disc is purplish to pinkish brown above, darkening slightly at the fin margins; the skin is easily abraded, leaving white patches. The underside of the disc is white with dark margins on the pectoral and pelvic fins. The snout is translucent, and the tail and caudal fin are almost black. The largest known specimen is a female long. Distribution and habitat The sixgill stingray has been recorded at widely scattered locations in the Indo-Pacific. In the Indian Ocean, it has been reported from South Africa off Port Elizabeth and Port Alfred, southwestern India, several islands of Indonesia, and Western Australia from Exmouth Plateau to Shark Bay. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been found from Japan to Taiwan and the Philippines, as well as off Flinders Reef in Queensland, New Caledonia, and Hawaii. This bottom-dwelling species typically inhabits upper continental slopes and seamounts at depths of . However, it occasionally ventures into shallower water, with one ray observed feeding at a depth of off Japan. It can be found over sandy, muddy, or rocky bottom substrates. Biology and ecology The cookiecutter shark is known to bite the sixgill stingray. The long snout of the sixgill stingray is very flexible both vertically and horizontally, suggesting that the ray uses it to probe for food in the bottom sediment. The underside of the snout is covered by well- developed ampullae of Lorenzini arranged in longitudinal rows, which are capable of detecting the minute electric fields produced by other organisms. The mouth can be protruded downward farther than the length of the head, likely allowing the ray to extract buried prey. The jaws are poorly mineralized, suggesting that it does not feed on hard-shelled animals. There is a record of a specimen with a wound from a cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis). Reproduction in the sixgill stingray is viviparous, with documented litter sizes of between two and five pups. Newly born rays measure around long. Both males and females mature sexually at approximately long. Human interactions For the most part, little fishing activity occurs at the depths occupied by the sixgill stingray, thus the IUCN has listed it as Least Concern. In the waters around Taiwan, it is caught in small numbers as bycatch in bottom trawls. The catch rate seems to have decreased in recent years, leading to concerns that it may be locally overfished, though quantitative data are lacking.

The story follows several people, both in Vancouver as well as in Frisco. Reception Reactions to Everyone in Silico were generally positive, with reviews comparing the work favourably to those of Bruce Sterling, Douglas Coupland and Philip K. Dick. Other reviewers were impressed with the humour and the level of detail presented of life in the novel's futuristic world, although some comment that the complexity of the plot made for a confusing read.

Church Churwell is a suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, between Leeds city centre and Morley. It is southwest of Leeds city centre and away from the Leeds United Elland Road Football Ground. Churwell still retains its semi-rural feel with farms nearby cultivating, in particular, vegetables and rhubarb. Location Churwell is in the new Morley and Outwood constituency, and is represented by Andrea Jenkyns (Conservative). Boundary changes in 2010 saw it leave the now-defunct Morley and Rothwell constituency, in which it was represented by Colin Challen (Labour). It is in the LS27 postcode area, and its telephone area code is 0113, the Leeds prefix. Formerly a small village, forming part of the Municipal Borough of Morley, it was expanded significantly in recent decades to become more suburban in nature. For administrative purposes, it is still classed as part of Morley in the census; sitting within the governance of Morley Town Council and the Morley North ward of Leeds City Council. Etymology The name Churwell is first attested in 1226 in the forms Churlewell and Churlewall. The names comes from the Old English words ceorla (the genitive plural of ceorl, 'free man of the lower class, peasant') and wella ('well, spring, stream'). Thus the name once meant 'spring of the peasants'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), p. 36. Historical landmarks Back of Clarendon Terrace, Park Street, Churwell Churwell is centred on \\"Churwell Hill\\" which is made up of the A643. About three-quarters of the way up Churwell Hill, the road changes name from Elland Road to Victoria Road. There have historically been three local public houses, of which two remain: The Commercial, the Golden Fleece (demolished) and the New Inn. These are known locally as top oyle, middle oyle and bottom oyle, relating to their position on the hill. The Golden Fleece was demolished in 2010 and is now occupied by a Tesco Express store which still has the Golden Fleece sign outside of it. In spring of 2017 opposite the Tesco Express on Old Road, Bar 27 opened on the premises of the old fish and chip shop. This has become known locally as the little oyle due to its size. Churwell once had a poorhouse. The building, Grade II listed, was built in 1865, it is just off Elland Road, and was used as a community centre up until May 2011, at which point the Stanhope Memorial Hall, across the road from the Poor Hall, became the community centre. The village expanded considerably in the early 1960s with new private and council housing developments, particularly to the north on land between School Street and the then-Leeds City boundary. In 1993, the old stone Churwell Primary School in School Street was demolished and moved to modern premises in the village. Houses now stand on the old school site. In 1923, a runaway tram ran down Churwell Hill and ended in tragedy: six people were killed and 35 injured when the brakes failed and the tram crashed into a field wall at Cottingley. Tragedy hit the village in 1962, when a motorcyclist ploughed into a group of girls returning from Sunday school on Churwell Hill, killing two and injuring several others. Churwell New Village Since 2001, a considerable amount of housing development has taken place, one notable area is Churwell New Village a development with more than 350 new residencies, planners estimated 0.5 cars per household. The development was built on a green field industrial area that once had a pit, brick works and later a reclamation yard on it. Notable people Natives of the town refer to themselves as Morleians.

It is the site of an important Bronze Age city, possibly the capital of Alasiya. Enkomi is under the de facto control of Northern Cyprus. In 1974, Enkomi had about 800 Greek Cypriot inhabitants. They all fled to the south of the island after the Turkish invasion, in the aftermath of the July coup. , Enkomi has a population of 2,645.

History The bronze \\"Horned God\\" from Enkomi The bronze \\"Ingot God\\" from Enkomi, 12th century BC, Cyprus Archaeological Museum, Nicosia Enkomi was settled in the Middle Bronze Age, near an inlet from the sea (now silted up). From about the 16th century BC to the 12th, it was an important trading center for copper, which was smelted at the site, with strong cultural links to Ugarit on the facing coast of Syria. The complicated and badly disturbed stratigraphy of the site hasThe French excavation report Enkomi-Alasia 1952, and Porphyrios Dikaios, ed. Enkomi Excavations 1948‚Äì1958; in four major phases, with many subdivisions: * Level A, a poorly represented preliminary stratum on bedrock; * Level I A, and B, at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, when fortifications were twice destroyed; * Level II A, and B, with many subdivisions, covering the elaborate expansion of the 14th and 13th centuries and ending in a mass destruction about 1220; * Level III A, B, and C, with Mycenaean settlers, with a destructive attack, possibly related to the Sea Peoples in IIIA, culturally continuous with IIIB, ending in a destruction about 1125, and IIIC, a final, Mycenaean phase with dwindling population. During the 13th century BC, Enkomi was inhabited by Greeks, like most of the cities of Cyprus. From the 13th century, other towns along the southern coast of Cyprus competed with Enkomi. After an earthquake ca. 1050 BC, the site was abandoned, leaving an opening for the rise of Salamis.

Long after the town disappeared, Hellenes recalled it in the cult title of Apollo Alasiotas, recorded in a Cypriote inscription as late as the 4th century BC. In 1900 the archaeologist Joseph Offord suggested that Apollo Alasiotas was a Syrian god identical with Resheph, transported to Cyprus,Joseph Offord, at the First International Congress of the History of Religion, (Paris, 1900) \\"Apollo Ressef and Apollo Alasiotas\\", reported by Nathaniel Schmidt, in The Biblical World 16.6 (December 1900:447‚Äì450). and some modern scholars remain unconvinced.R.S.

She is the mother of Beppe (Michael Greco), Gianni (Marc Bannerman), Teresa (Leila Birch) and Nicky di Marco (Carly Hillman). Rosa was killed off-screen in 2002, to coincide with her son Beppe's departure from the square. Storylines Rosa first appears when George Palmer (Paul Moriarty) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) attend her husband's funeral in January 1998, and later moves to Walford in February 1998 along with the rest of her family. She sets up her own restaurant called Giuseppe's, named after her late husband. George had helped set this up. It was later revealed that she and George had a fling many years ago, during the time her husband Giuseppe was in prison. This leads George to believe that Rosa's son Gianni could be his son rather than Giuseppe's. This shock leads to Gianni breaking up with George's daughter Annie Palmer (Nadia Sawalha), after fearing they had been having an incestuous affair. DNA tests later confirm that Gianni is Giuseppe's son, which relieves both Rosa and Gianni. Jeff Healy (Leslie Schofield) has a crush on her, but Rosa rejects his advances. Nicky later gets food poisoning from the local caf√© and Rosa tries to have it closed down. Rosa later faces financial trouble with the restaurant and George offers her help, which she accepts. After Nicky claims she was assaulted by her mathematics tutor Rod Morris (Forbes Masson) and later admits she did not tell the whole truth (but was still assaulted) and then dissowns the family when they said she was lying, Rosa decides the whole family should leave Walford to move to Leicester and except for Beppe, the entire family leaves Walford in August 2000. Rosa dies from a heart attack two years later, at the age of 50. Beppe then joins the rest of his family in Leicester.  Character creation and development  Casting The Italian di Marco family were introduced early in 1998 by Series Producer Jane Harris. The di Marcos were a family of eight, consisting of grandparents Bruno and Luisa (Leon Lissek and Stella Tanner), their daughter-in-law Rosa, her children Beppe, Gianni, Teresa and Nicky, and Beppe's young son Joe (Jake Kyprianou). They were heralded as the \\"family that would rival the Mitchells\\", one of the most successful and long-running families to have been featured in EastEnders. The di Marcos \\"landed with an almighty thud in January [1998], turning out in force for the funeral of patriarch Giuseppe\\", who was Rosa's husband and an old business associate of the character George Palmer (Paul Moriarty). The following month, the family moved to the area in which the soap is set, Walford, to run an Italian restaurant, which was named Giuseppe's. Departure and death The di Marcos remained with the show as a unit until 2000, when the new executive producer, John Yorke, decided to cull the majority of the family. All except Beppe (Michael Greco) and his son Joe (Jake Kyprianou) were written out. They were reportedly \\"slaughtered because of a shortage of ideas for what to do with them\\". A source allegedly told The Mirror: \\"It is always unpleasant having to say goodbye to people who have given loyal service to the show for a number of years. But John Yorke feels it is time to make his mark on the show. Every new producer likes to do the same. John wants to introduce a new family later this year and felt the di Marcos had nowhere else to go. Their storylines were beginning to feel tired, and that is a good time to make such a drastic change...there is a lot of sympathy for actress Louise Jameson, because her character was two-dimensional from the start. Nagging, moaning mums are not viewer-friendly. There was nothing sexy or appealing about Rosa, through no fault of Louise.\\" However, an official BBC spokesperson at the time commented: \\"These changes‚Ä¶are just part of [John Yorke's] plans to revamp the series and give it a new look.\\" The cuts paved the way for the arrival of the \\"hugely popular\\" Slater family. Beppe and Joe remained until 2002, when they were axed too. Jameson said she was \\"absolutely gutted\\" about getting axed from EastEnders. She commented: \\"I'll really miss Rosa. It's like parting from a lover. I can't help thinking that she's not quite played out. A fling would have been nice with Frank, or even Roy when he was on Viagra and rampant.\\" Reception The di Marcos are now deemed as something of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes: \\"Nobody really knew what to do with the di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them‚Ä¶it was as if they had never been\\". Matthew Baylis of The Guardian has commented on their lack of success: \\"Thank heaven for off-screen uncles. As we saw during the hurried departure of the di Marco family from Albert Square, there is nothing like a fictitious relative when you need to get characters off the screen‚Ä¶the di Marcos' departure had its dodgy elements. A hitherto unheard-of uncle needs help in his restaurant, so the whole family ups sticks. Including Teresa - who had always fought for independence from her family? Rosa, who presumably owned the house she had transformed into something resembling an Imperial Palace, is suddenly prepared to leg it with a couple of suitcases? There was plenty that did not ring true. But few viewers minded. There was, if anything, more sympathy for the programme-makers, trying valiantly to dispose of this singularly unpopular family while retaining an element of drama.\\" The di Marcos have been dismissed as \\"unconvincing characters\\". Baylis goes on to highlight a problem that he feels \\"dogged the whole family\\": their occupation as restaurateurs. Baylis believes this kept them \\"self-contained\\", and prevented them from establishing meaningful links with other characters. He explains: \\"[The di Marcos] had an ambiguity, heightened by the job they did. Soapland has no place for grey areas. Bad things happen to bad people. They also happen to good people, of course, but not for very long. To make this predictable universe work on the screen, you need characters who are relatively stable (even if they are unstable). The writers and the viewers buy into a myth that people are not particularly complex, that the full range of their feelings and actions can be revealed in a few hours on the television. And a quick, visible way of revealing characters is to mirror them in their occupation. Thus we have Pauline Fowler, long-suffering drudge and matriarch. What better job than folding pants all day in the launderette? Or Peggy [Mitchell] - tough but fun-loving and gregarious. So she runs the pub. But what attributes spring to mind when we think of Italian restaurants? Fond of pasta, perhaps? Permanently overworked? The job never provided an easy route into understanding the di Marcos' characters‚Ä¶the most visible jobs tend to be taken by the strongest, most vivid characters. Confined to their restaurant, the di Marcos could only become involved in Walford life when other characters came over to eat a carbonara. And how often do working-class East End people do that? If any di Marco wanted a night out, a pint in the Vic, a clandestine liaison, then an excuse had to be found as to why they were not working. Transforming Giuseppe's into a daytime sandwich bar, and sending Teresa onto the market were bold rescue attempts, but they came too late. The viewers had already decided they did not much care‚Ä¶because of their jobs, the di Marcos became a largely self-contained unit‚Ä¶\\" Tony Stewart of the Daily Mirror called Rosa \\"conniving\\".

It is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific, typically over fine sediments on the upper continental slope at depths of . This species reaches in length and in width. It has an oval pectoral fin disc with a long, flexible, broad-angled snout. Most of the entire latter half of its tail supports a distinctively long, slender, leaf-shaped caudal fin. Its coloration is dark above and white below, and its skin is almost completely covered by tiny dermal denticles. Preying on crustaceans, cephalopods, and bony fishes, the deepwater stingray may hunt both on the sea floor and well above it in open water. It is probably aplacental viviparous, with the mother supplying her gestating young with histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\"). Captured rays merit caution due to their long, venomous stingers. This species is taken by deepwater commercial fisheries, but in numbers too small to significantly threaten its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed it as Least Concern. Taxonomy and phylogeny The first scientific description of the deepwater stingray was authored by John H. Wallace, as part of a 1967 Investigational Report from the Oceanographic Research Institute, Durban. He named the new species daviesi in honor of David H. Davies, the late director of the ORI, and placed it in the genus Urotrygon based on its long, low caudal fin and lack of a dorsal fin. The type specimens were collected during September 1996 near the Limpopo River mouth in Mozambique: the holotype is a mature male across, and the paratype is an immature male across. Other common names for this species include Davies' stingray and giant stingray. In a 1990 morphological phylogenetic study, Kiyonori Nishida concluded that the deepwater stingray and the sixgill stingray (Hexatrygon bickelli) were the most basal stingrays (suborder Myliobatoidei). Therefore, he moved this species to its own genus, Plesiobatis, and family, Plesiobatidae; the name is derived from the Greek plesio (\\"primitive\\") and batis (\\"ray\\"). Subsequent morphological studies have corroborated the basal position of Plesiobatis, but disagreed on its relationships to nearby taxa. John McEachran, Katherine Dunn, and Tsutomu Miyake in 1996 could not fully resolve the position of Plesiobatis, thus they assigned it provisionally to the family Hexatrygonidae. McEachran and Neil Aschliman in 2004 found Plesiobatis to be the sister taxon of Urolophus, and recommended that it be placed in the family Urolophidae. Until the phylogeny is better-resolved, authors have tended to preserve the family Plesiobatidae. Distribution and habitat Records of the deepwater stingray come from a number of locations scattered widely in the Indo-Pacific: KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and Mozambique, the Gulf of Mannar, the northern Andaman Islands, the South China Sea, the Ryukyu Islands and the Kyushu-Palau Ridge, along the southern coastline of Australia, northwestern Australia from the Rowley Shoals to Shark Bay, northeastern Australia from Townsville to Wooli, New Caledonia, and Hawaii. This bottom-dwelling species generally inhabits the upper continental slope at depths of , over muddy or silty substrates. An anomalous record from only deep off Mozambique was made. It seems to be locally common in tropical Australian waters, but may be rarer elsewhere. Description The deepwater stingray has a flabby body, with enlarged pectoral fins forming a disc usually longer than it is wide. The leading margins of the disc converge at a broad angle. The snout is thin and measures over six times as long as the diameter of the orbit; the snout tip protrudes slightly from the disc. The small eyes are positioned just ahead of the spiracles, which have angular posterior rims. The large, circular nostrils are placed close to the mouth, to which they are connected by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a broad curtain of skin with a strongly fringed posterior margin. The wide, straight mouth contains 32‚Äì60 tooth rows in either jaw, increasing in number with age. Each tooth is small with a low, blunt cusp; in adult males the teeth at the center are sharp and backward- pointing. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and have blunt outer corners. The moderately thick tail measures 93‚Äì102% as long as the disc and lacks lateral skin folds and dorsal fins. One or two serrated stinging spines are present atop the tail, just ahead of the halfway point. The slender caudal fin originates a short distance behind the sting; it is symmetrical above and below, and terminates in a rounded leaf-like shape. The skin is densely covered by fine dermal denticles, that become sparse to absent on the pelvic fins, towards the ventral disc margin, and around the mouth. The deepwater stingray is purplish brown to blackish above; some rays also have irregular darker blotches and spots. The underside is white, with a narrow dark border along the lateral disc margins. The tail is entirely dark, and the caudal fin is black. This large species grows up to long, across, and in weight off southern Africa, though it is not known to exceed long off Australia. Biology and ecology The kitefin shark is known to attack the deepwater stingray. The diet of the deepwater stingray consists of cephalopods, crustaceans (including penaeid prawns, crabs, and lobsters), and bony fishes (including eels). Its long, flexible snout is well-suited for rooting through sediment, while the presence of mesopelagic species in its diet suggest that it may also hunt well above the sea floor. One recorded individual was found severely gouged by kitefin sharks (Dalatias licha), which are capable of excising plugs of flesh, cookiecutter-like, from larger animals. The deepwater stingray is presumed to be similar to other stingrays in being aplacental viviparous, and having the developing embryos nourished by maternally produced histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\"). Given its large size and deepwater habits, it is probably not highly prolific, with a small litter size and a long gestation period. The young are apparently born at close to long, as evidenced by the capture of a free-living specimen of that size that still bore a yolk sac scar. Males and females mature sexually at and long respectively. The maximum size, and likely also the maturation size, varies between geographic regions. Human interactions When captured, the deepwater stingray flails its powerful tail violently, and its long, venomous sting can inflict a serious injury to a fishery worker. It is caught incidentally by deepwater bottom trawls and longlines; the meat may be sold but is poorly regarded. None of the deepwater commercial fisheries operating within its range (including those off South Africa, Taiwan, Indonesia and Australia) are extensive, and thus only small numbers of deepwater stingrays are landed. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has determined this species to be minimally threatened by human activity, and listed it under least concern. However, should deepwater fisheries expand in the future, it may be susceptible to depletion due to its probable rarity and low reproductive rate.

The campaign for Cornish devolution began in 2000 with the founding of the Cornish Constitutional Convention, a cross-party, cross-sector association that campaigns for devolution to Cornwall. In 2001, the Convention sent 50,000 individually signed declarations calling for a Cornish Assembly to 10 Downing Street, during the then- government's attempt at introducing regional assemblies, however the call went unanswered. The act of turning Cornwall County Council into a unitary authority in 2009 was based on the idea that it would give Cornwall a stronger voice and be a \\"stepping stone\\" to a Cornish Assembly, and a \\"Government of Cornwall\\" bill was introduced to the UK Parliament in the same year by Cornish MP Dan Rogerson, but did not succeed. Following the announcement of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and with promises of more devolution across the UK from Westminster politicians, there have been renewed calls for devolution to Cornwall. In November 2014 a petition was launched on the government petitions website campaigning for a Cornish Assembly. A law-making Cornish Assembly is party policy for the Liberal Democrats, Mebyon Kernow and the Greens. Background Duchy Palace in Lostwithiel, site of the autonomous Cornish stannary courts and then-capital of Cornwall (the tinners parliament was last held in the Hall in 1751) Cornwall enjoyed a level of self- government until 1753 through its Stannary Parliament. The privileges of the stannaries were confirmed on the creation of the Duchy of Cornwall in 1337, and strengthened by the 1508 Charter of Pardon, which came after the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 was partly instigated by anger over Henry VII's overturning of stannary rights to wage war against Scotland (see also Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament). Laws and maps of the time mentioned \\"Anglia et Cornubia\\" (England and Cornwall). With the decline of the Cornish language blurring the distinction between Cornish people and English people in the eyes of central government, Cornwall began to be administered as a county of England. Cornwall County Council was created by the Local Government Act 1888. At the same time, the Celtic revival saw the emergence of Cornish nationalism. Although it was mainly concerned with culture in its early days, some inspiration was taken from the movements for Irish, Welsh and Scottish home rule, with a Cornish newspaper declaring in 1912, \\"There is another Home Rule movement on the horizon. Self-government for Cornwall will be the next move\\". The Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow was formed in 1951, calling for greater autonomy in what it hoped would become a federal UK. Post Second World War Cornwall became increasingly linked with Devon in an economic, political and statistical sense (more recently this process has become known as \\"Devonwall- isation\\"), symbolised by the merging of Devon and Cornwall Police in 1967. With entry into the European Economic Community and the prospect of receiving European development funds, there was mounting evidence that the unpopular Devonwall process significantly disadvantaged Cornwall. Devon's relative wealth overshadowed Cornwall's low GDP and high deprivation, meaning that the single \\"Devonwall\\" area did not qualify for EU funding. In 1998 Cornwall was recognised by the UK Government as having \\"distinct cultural and historical factors reflecting a Celtic background\\", paving the way for NUTS2 region status and allowing Cornwall's issues to become visible. During the 1990s the pace of debate gathered parallel to discussions relating to National Minority status for the Cornish under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and recognition for the Cornish language within the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (both campaigns ultimately being successful). The calls for Cornish devolution also gained more widespread attention. In 1990, a Guardian newspaper editorial commented ‚ÄúSmaller minorities also have equally proud visions of themselves as irreducibly Welsh, Irish, Manx or Cornish. These identities are distinctly national in ways which proud people from Yorkshire, much less proud people from Berkshire will never know. Any new constitutional settlement which ignores these factors will be built on uneven ground.\\" Assembly campaign In 2001, 50,000 signed declarations calling for a Cornish Assembly were presented to 10 Downing Street - over 10% of Cornwall's electorate. In the late 1990s, devolution became a political issue in the UK with the creation of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. Campaigners in Cornwall responded by campaigning for similar devolution in Cornwall, the Liberal Party called for a Cornish Parliament at the 1997 General Election, and in July 2000 Mebyon Kernow issued a \\"Declaration for a Cornish Assembly\\", which said: > \\"Cornwall is a distinct region. It has a clearly defined economic, > administrative and social profile. Cornwall's unique identity reflects its > Celtic character, culture and environment. We declare that the people of > Cornwall will be best served in their future governance by a Cornish > regional assembly. We therefore commit ourselves to setting up the Cornish > Constitutional Convention with the intention of achieving a devolved Cornish > Assembly - Senedh Kernow.\\" Three months later the Cornish Constitutional Convention (which had been meeting for some time as an informal discussion group) held its first open meeting to promote the objective of establishing a devolved Assembly. In less than two years, Mebyon Kernow's petition attracted the signatures of over 50,000 people calling for a referendum on a Cornish Assembly, which is a little over 10% of the total Cornish electorate. A delegation including MK leader Dick Cole, West Cornwall Liberal Democrat MP Andrew George and representatives of the Convention (Richard Ford, David Fieldsend and Andrew Climo) presented the declaration to 10 Downing Street on Wednesday 12 December 2001. The Labour government did not respond to the petition, and continued to promote its own plans for English regional assemblies, placing Cornwall within the South West region. The plans were put on hold when voters overwhelmingly rejected a regional assembly in the North East of England in 2004. In 2007, the Labour government announced plans to abolish regional assemblies. The then Cornish MP Dan Rogerson asked the government to look again at the case for a locally accountable Cornish Assembly and Cornish Development Agency, \\"in light of the important convergence funding from the EU\\". The same year, the then leader of Cornwall County Council David Whalley stated \\"There is something inevitable about the journey to a Cornish Assembly. We are also moving forward in creating a Cornish Development Agency - we are confident that strategic planning powers will come back to us after the SW regional assembly goes.\\" In 2008 Parliament agreed plans to create a unitary authority for Cornwall, abolishing the six district councils. Leaders at the time claimed that the unitary would provide a \\"single voice\\" for Cornwall to demand greater powers, and be a \\"stepping stone\\" to a Cornish Assembly. In 2011 Bert Biscoe, of the Cornish Constitutional Convention, commissioned a researcher to visit Guernsey as part of the devolution campaign, to meet politicians and lawmakers and see if the island's system of government could be of inspiration to Cornwall. The new Cameron‚ÄìClegg coalition government abolished the South West Regional Development Agency and replaced it with local enterprise partnerships. In 2014 the government announced plans to place Cornish EU funds into a nationally run programme, depriving Cornwall of its ability to allocate where the money goes. This decision was later reversed and Cornwall was granted the autonomy to manage its own EU funds. In July 2015, Second Cameron ministry gave Cornwall council powers over bus services and local investment, while indicating health and social services may integrate. In March 2016 Mebyon Kernow launched a new document \\"Towards a National Assembly of Cornwall\\". Current proposals The Cornish Constitutional Convention has held up the Channel Island of Guernsey as a potential model for Cornish autonomy. (Guernsey Parliament building pictured) In 2014, Mebyon Kernow relaunched its campaign for a Cornish Assembly with Towards a National Assembly for Cornwall. It argues that Cornwall currently \\"lacks the tools to make important political, economic, environmental and social decisions for itself\\", and that government bodies, quangos and agencies \\"fail to recognise the strengths of Cornwall or understand the special needs of its communities\\". The paper proposes a forty- member assembly with a first minister and executive that has power over the following areas: *Agriculture, fisheries and food *Environment and heritage (planning, monuments, national records) *Education and skills *Culture (sport, language, the arts, broadcasting) *Local government *Justice and administration (courts, charities, electoral review) *Economic development (enterprise, industry, energy, technology, science) *Transport *Health In September 2014, the then St Ives MP Andrew George called on Cornwall to use the Scottish independence referendum as an opportunity to mount a campaign for devolution, saying \\"If Scotland and Wales can be offered further powers then Cornwall must be next in line. After all, Cornwall is already recognised as a distinct region for economic development purposes, as a separate people and for its distinct language.\\" Earlier in the year, the Liberal Democrats voted to make a Cornish Assembly party policy at their annual conference in York, although their ideas have been criticised by Mebyon Kernow as \\"nothing more than local government reform\\". The Liberal Democrats announced that a Cornish Assembly would be in their manifesto for the 2015 general election, proposing a \\"Devolution Enabling Act\\" that would give Cornwall the chance to take law- making powers from Westminster. Prospective MP Julia Goldsworthy said \\"we need real devolution in Cornwall too. Not just more power for local government, but a proper legislative assembly for Cornwall like Wales has.\\" In March 2015, visiting Cornwall on St Piran's Day, Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg elaborated on his party's plans, saying \\"Cornwall could choose to have different rules to England on a whole range of policy areas like academy schools, health service spending, right-to-buy, second home ownership and bus services.\\" The leader of the Conservative group in Cornwall Council, Fiona Ferguson, called the plans to ask government for more powers for Cornwall to govern itself \\"very attractive\\". In January 2015 Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls pledged greater \\"flexibility\\" in local decision making during a visit to Cornwall. In March 2015, Cornwall Council published The Case for Cornwall, a booklet containing its proposals for devolution in areas of transport, energy, health, social care, housing, economy and heritage. Council leader John Pollard stated that following initial discussions, a \\"more detailed document\\" would be submitted to the government following the 2015 election. In July 2015 the UK government devolved control over bus services in Cornwall to the unitary council. According to the council's transport portfolio holder, Bert Biscoe, the deal gives him far more control over buses, strengthening his ability to ensure that routes run in rural areas - which private bus companies might find uncommercial. The integration of health and social services in Cornwall was also announced. The implementation of the changes required the passing of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016.  Support  Popular support for devolved power in Cornwall was shown when a 50,000 petition for a Cornish Assembly was handed to the government in 2001. The petition had the support of all five Cornish Liberal Democrat MPs, Cornwall Council and most independent councillors. The same year, the leader of the Scottish Parliament, Jim Wallace, expressed his support for an Assembly. In 2003, a Cornwall County Council-commissioned MORI poll showed a result of 55% of Cornish people in favour of a fully devolved Cornish Assembly. Lord Whitty, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, in the House of Lords, recognised that Cornwall had a \\"special case\\" for devolutionHouse of Lords debates, Wednesday, 21 March 2001, \\"Devolution: England\\" transcript of speech and on a visit to Cornwall, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said \\"Cornwall has the strongest regional identity in the UK.\\" In December 2011, Welsh MP Jonathan Edwards submitted an Early Day Motion requesting a Cornish Assembly. The bid was sponsored by Cornish MPs Dan Rogerson and Andrew George, as well as Welsh MPs Elfyn Llwyd and Hywel Williams and English MP John McDonnell. The Motion was also signed by Labour, Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru MPs. In February 2012, Eden Project founder Tim Smit added his support for a Cornish Assembly in an interview with BBC Spotlight. He hoped that greater devolution of powers and control of finances to Cornwall would aid in the development of green and other innovative technologies by Cornish companies. In May 2014, leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, Natalie Bennett, expressed her party's support for a Cornish Assembly and signed a declaration to support Mebyon Kernow's proposals. In September 2014, a Pirate FM poll on a Cornish Assembly ended with 64% in favour of greater powers for Cornwall. A poll carried of 500 voters in the Camborne and Redruth constituency by Survation for the University of Exeter in November 2014 found that 60% were in favour of power being devolved from Westminster to Cornwall, with only 19% opposed and 49% were in favour of the creation of a Cornish Assembly, with 31% opposed. In 2014 Mebyon Kernow's online poll petitioning The UK Prime Minister and Cabinet to \\"Create a Cornish Assembly\\" achieved 2,667 supporters.

In , Jackson led the National League (NL) with 24 wins (playing for the eighth-place Cubs), and was runner-up in the Cy Young Award voting; he also led the NL in innings pitched and shutouts, once each. Jackson's 194 career NL victories are the most in the league since 1900 by any right-hander who never played for a first-place team. A model of reliability, he won at least 13 games in each of his last 12 seasons. He later served four terms in the Idaho Legislature. Early years Born in Nampa, Idaho, Jackson graduated from Boise High School in 1949. He attended Boise Junior College and played both football and baseball for the Broncos; he was a junior college All-American halfback on the 1950 team that played in the Junior Rose Bowl He signed with the Cardinals in 1951 and was with Pocatello in the Class C Pioneer League. In , he led the California League with 351 strikeouts and a record for the pennant-winning Fresno Cardinals. Major league career He broke into the majors with St. Louis in 1955, posting a record, and gradually worked his way into the starting rotation by 1958. He was named to the NL All- Star team in 1957, 1958, and 1960 while with the Cardinals, and allowed only two hits and no runs in 3-‚Öî innings in the three appearances; the 1957 game was played at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis. In 1960 he led the NL with 282 innings and 38 games started, also winning 18 games, but he missed the first four weeks of the 1961 season after having his jaw broken in a late spring training game by a flying piece of Duke Snider's After the 1962 season, Jackson was traded to the Cubs along with Lindy McDaniel in a six-player deal; the Cardinals received three players including Jackson was again an All-Star in 1963, and earned the win despite it being his least effective appearance in the Midsummer Classic; after entering with a lead in the third inning, he allowed the tying runs, but the NL again took a lead in the top of the fifth as he departed. He enjoyed his best season the following year; despite the Cubs' record, Jackson was with 148 strikeouts and a 3.14 earned run average. He also set a major league record for pitchers with 109 total chances without an error, breaking the mark of 108 shared by Three Finger Brown () and Eppa Rixey (); Randy Jones broke his record with 112 for the San Diego Padres in . With only one Cy Young Award for both leagues at that time, Dean Chance of the American League's Los Angeles Angels won the award with 17 of the 20 votes; Jackson received two votes, while Sandy Koufax of the Dodgers received one. Jackson lost 21 games in 1965, the first since Murry Dickson in 1951‚Äì52 to have twenty wins and twenty losses in consecutive seasons. One of those losses was in ten innings to Jim Maloney of the Cincinnati Reds, who threw a no- hitter with In early he was traded to the Phillies in the deal which brought Ferguson Jenkins to Chicago, and he ended the season as one of six pitchers tied for the league shutout lead with five. In 1967, he won his 171st game to pass Bill Doak, who had previously been the winningest NL right-hander of the 20th century to never play for a pennant winner. On June 20 of that year, he pitched a one-hitter against the New York Mets. After a 13‚Äì17 season with a 2.77 ERA in 1968, Jackson was selected by the Montreal Expos in the October 1968 expansion draft, but chose to retire rather than join the team; Bobby Wine was sent from the Phillies to the Expos the following April as compensation. In a 14-season career, Jackson posted a record with 1,709 strikeouts, 37 shutouts, and a 3.40 ERA in 558 games and 3,262‚Öî innings. He tied a record held by Claude Passeau by four times having the most total chances among pitchers with a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage (1957, 1964, 1965, 1968). After baseball Jackson returned to Boise and was an insurance agent and a lobbyist for Boise Cascade. He served four terms as a Republican from Ada County in the Idaho House of Representatives, became executive director of the Republican State Committee. He ran for governor in 1978, but was fourth in the six-man GOP primary in August, won by who lost the general election to incumbent John Evans.

The population of Calverley in 2011 was 4,328.http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.co.uk/ Census 2011 Output Areas E00058402-E00058405 and E00048441-E00058450 It is part of the City of Leeds ward Calverley and Farsley, with a population of 22,594 at the 2011 Census. Etymology The name of Calverley is first attested in the 1086 Domesday Book, as Caverlei and Caverleia. Spellings including the l, such as Kalverlay, are found in twelfth-century sources. The name comes from the Old English words calfra, the genitive plural of calf ('calf'), and lƒìah ('open ground in woodland'). Thus the name once meant \\"calves' clearing\\" or something similar.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), p. 32.  History  Historically, Calverley was a parish in the district of Bradford and the Morley wapentake, but was incorporated into the municipal borough of Pudsey in 1937, of which it remained a part until its abolition in 1974. Calverley is a rural village with a medieval manor house, Calverley Old Hall, which dates back to the 14th century and was home to the Calverley family. In 1605 the landowner, Walter Calverley, went insane and murdered some of his children in Calverley Hall. He refused to plead and was ordered to be pressed to death, a method used to try to force a confession. He died without confessing his crime in order to ensure that his estate was not taken from his remaining family. Houses in the village are mostly constructed of sandstone, darkened by the soot of the Industrial Revolution, though there are brick buildings to the south of the original village. The Anglican parish church St Wilfrid's has parts dating from the 11th or 12th century. The tower was added and increased in the 13th to 15th century.Calverley Today David Weldrake (20 December 2007) Calverley Village History The Methodist church beside Victoria Park opened in 1872. Both churches are Grade II listed buildings.Claverley Today Faith Calverley Cutting, a straight road which was intended to replace the old winding packhorse way through the woods between Carr Road in Calverley and Apperley Bridge, was cut through the local sandstone rock by 1856. It was meant to be part of a scheme to develop the area for luxurious residential purposes which, however, failed. Local residents objected to the closure of the old route because the new road proved to be very steep. Calverley and Rodley railway station on the line of the former Leeds and Bradford Railway was opened in 1846, closed to passengers in 1965 and to freight in 1968.  Administration  The village was part of the Municipal Borough of Pudsey alongside Farsley until 1974, though for centuries previously both Pudsey and Farsley were part of the Calverley parish.  Sports and recreation  The recreation ground in Victoria Park is home to Calverley St Wilfrid's Cricket Club.Calverley St Wilfrid's Cricket Club There are two golf courses to the south of the village: Woodhall Hills (established 1905) off Woodhall Road, and Calverley Golf Club off Woodhall Lane.

After the resignation of Williams' predecessor, Bob Wade, due to NCAA violations, a de facto boycott of the university was put in place by the high-school coaches in Baltimore. Because of this boycott, many star high-school players avoided Maryland as a choice to play their college ball. In becoming one of the members of Maryland's 1993 recruiting class, Booth broke the ice, and the school once again had access to talent-rich Baltimore City. Booth was a 1993 McDonald's All- American.http://www.mcdonaldsallamerican.com/content/dam/allamerican/pdfs/Player- Alumni-List-12-2013.pdf Booth was the Chicago Bulls' first-pick (28th overall) in the 1997 NBA Draft, and he played two seasons with the Bulls. Booth later returned to the Maryland campus and earned a bachelor's degree in criminology and criminal justice in 2003. After getting his degree, he worked at the Park School of Baltimore in Brooklandville, Maryland, where he was the middle school baseball coach. He also volunteered at an after-school program at his former high school, Dunbar. In 2004, he returned to his alma mater to become an assistant under Williams. He organized recruiting as well as promoting and directing the Gary Williams Summer Basketball Camp each Summer in College Park. After Williams' retirement in 2011, Booth left Maryland when incoming head coach Mark Turgeon chose not to retain him.Markus, Don. \\"Keith Booth, former Maryland star, added to Loyola men's basketball staff,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Tuesday, April 16, 2013.

It is based on the 1981 horror film of the same name. Although the BBC Micro and C64 versions received a full commercial release, the ZX Spectrum version was never released on its own and eventually appeared on the \\"B\\"-side of Cauldron. The Evil Dead was the first (and for some time, only) officially licensed video game based on the series. Starting with 2000's Evil Dead: Hail to the King, several other Evil Dead games have since been released, albeit from other publishers and with no direct connection to Palace's 1984 game.  Gameplay  Screenshot from the ZX Spectrum version of the game The game is set in the cabin from the Evil Dead film. The player controls Ash, and must close cabin windows to prevent monsters from entering, while also killing monsters that are already in the cabin. As the player defeats monsters with various weapons (shovels, shotguns, and axes), Ash's energy level decreases. Ash must continuously pick up new weapons in order to increase his energy. Once he has defeated all the monsters, Ash must obtain The Book of the Dead and destroy it in order to defeat the evil. Reception Contemporary opinion and \\"computer nasties\\" controversy Your Computer magazine's 1984 review noted then-contemporary concerns that gaming spin-offs of \\"video nasties\\" (such as The Evil Dead) might spawn similarly explicit \\"computer nasties\\". However, it considered that the game itself allayed any such fears, saying \\"you might have wondered if home computer graphics were capable of the sort of gory special effects video nasties trade in. The Evil Dead would confirm your doubts [..] there is nothing here to keep even the most unworldly 12-year-old awake at night\\". Despite this, and the game's similarities to Atic Atac being noted, the review was generally positive, considering the graphics \\"excellent\\" and stating that there was \\"enough variety in it to keep the interest alive\\". Retrospective In a 2004 retrospective, Retro Gamer stated that while the game was simplistic by current standards, it was \\"fun to play (for about five minutes anyway)\\".

The exact date of its writing is not known, but it is estimated the text was written in the 11th or 12th century. It is speculated that Ratirahasya was written to please a king by the name Venudutta. Kokkoka describes himself in the book as siddha patiya pandita, i.e. \\"an ingenious man among learned men\\". The manual was written in Sanskrit. Historical context Unlike the Kama Sutra, which is an ancient sex manual related to Hindu literature, Ratirahasya deals with medieval Indian society. During the medieval age, India became more conservative compared to ancient India, freedom of women decreased, and premarital and extramarital sex were frowned upon. A sex manual was needed that would be suitable for the medieval cultural climate, and Ratirahasya was written, quite different from the ancient text Kama Sutra. Structure There are fifteen pachivedes (chapters) and 800 verses in Ratirahasya which deal with various topics such as different physiques, lunar calendar, different types of genitals, characteristics of women of various ages, hugs, kisses, sexual intercourse and sex positions, sex with a strange woman, etc. Kokokka describes various stages of love in Ratirahasya, the fifth stage being weight loss, the ninth is fainting, and the tenth and last stage is death. Ratirahasya makes classifications of women, and describes erogenous zones and days that lead to women's easy arousal. Ratirahasya is the first book to describe in detail Indian feminine beauty. The book classified women into four psycho-physical types, according to their appearance and physical features. # Padmini (lotus woman) # Chitrini (art woman) # Shankini (conch woman) # Hastini (elephant woman) On the basis of the size of the genitals, the text classifies sexual intercourse into nine different types. Aphrodisiacs are also described in the book. Analysis According to W.G. Archer, Kokkoka \\"is concerned with how to make the most of sex, how to enjoy it and how to keep a woman happy.\\" In writing this text, Kokokka depended on a number of other authors including, among others Nandikeshvara, Gonikaputra, and Vatsyayana. Translations Arabic, Persian and Turkish translations of the book are entitled Lizzat-al-Nissa. Alex Comfort, author of The Joy of Sex, made an English translation of Ratirahasya in 1964 titled The Koka Shastra, Being the Ratirahasya of Kokkoka, and Other Medieval Indian Writings on Love (London: George Allen and Unwin). Another English translation was made by S. C. Upadhyaya, entitled Kokashastra (Rati Rahasya) of Pundit Kokkoka. Some commentaries have been written on this text by Avana Rama Chandra, Kavi Prabhu, and Harihara. It is a popular text in India, second only to the Kama Sutra among sex manuals.

It had a population of 1,646 at the 2011 Census. Etymology The name of Thorner is first attested in the 1086 Domesday Book as Torneure, Tornoure and Tornoura. The name comes from the Old English words √æorn ('thorn') and ofer ('bank, slope'), and thus meant \\"thorn bank\\".Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place- Names Society, 2017). The township and parish of Thorner also included Eltofts, whose name comes from the Old English masculine personal name Ella and the Old English word toft (itself borrowed from Old Norse topt), which meant 'curtilage, messuage, plot of land with a building'. Thus the name once meant 'Ella's plot of land'. History St Peter's Church There is archaeological evidence of Bronze Age and Anglo-Saxon settlements, while the name St Osyth's Well, just west of the church, refers to a Viking Age saint. The ancient parish of Thorner covered 4400 acres in the wapentake of Skyrack in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The parish included the townships of Scarcroft and Shadwell, which became separate civil parishes in 1866.Vision of Britain website In 1245 it acquired a market, and the area around Main Street shows a typical Medieval layout of strips leading from a market street. The base of a medieval market cross is on Butts Garth. As well as farming, pottery was a local industry in the Middle Ages, supplanted by the textile industry in the 18th and 19th centuries. Thorner railway station (which also served nearby Scarcroft and was originally called Thorner & Scarcroft, opened 1876 and closed 1964 under the Beeching cuts and was demolished and the area developed into housing. It was on the Cross Gates to Wetherby Line, which thereby gave access to Leeds and Harrogate, with some services running between these two extremes. This resulted in an increase in housing and a more widespread distribution of agricultural and industrial products with a substantial number of shops. The end of the annual agricultural show in 1924 indicates the lesser importance of farming to the community. However, from the 1950s local businesses declined as the village population increasingly commuted to larger centres such as Leeds. In 1970 the main part was designated a Conservation Area by Leeds City Council: in 2009 the area was extended to include the area of Sandhills to the south. This has essentially limited industrial development and restricted new housing to the surroundings. Many of the properties on Main Street are listed buildings along with St Peter's Church (grade II). The church of St Peter is built in the later English gothic style and has a square embattled tower. In the graveyard is the memorial to John Philips, who lived to 118 years. A school was built by subscription in 1787, and is now the Parish Centre. The Wesleyan Methodists have a place of worship on the main street in the village, their nineteenth-century chapel having been converted to flats. Geography Thorner is situated close to the A1, A58 and A64 trunk roads. It is 8 miles (13 km) north-east of Leeds city centre and 7 miles (11 km) to the south-west of Wetherby. The underlying rock is limestone, some of which was burnt into lime and flagstone and slates were quarried. Travel to and from the village by public transport is via the number 7 bus route (operated by the Transdev Harrogate & District bus company). The journey takes roughly half an hour from Leeds, 20 minutes from Wetherby and an hour from Harrogate. Features Thorner has no street lighting. The village has two public houses, the Mexborough Arms and The Fox. There is no longer a post office or a village shop, but there is a delicatessen, a hairdresser's and a restaurant, formerly The Beehive pub. Social amenities include the Parish Centre next to the church, the Victory Hall in Carr Lane, an over-60s centre, a bowling green, tennis courts and cricket and football pitches.

After befriending Zsa Zsa Gabor, her new friend provides the pooch with the \\"skinny\\" on the ins and outs of achieving Hollywood fame. Wandering through the famous haunts of tinseltown, Mooch comes across Vincent Price at the Brown Derby and ends up in his Jeep. Price wants to give the dog to a young admirer and takes Mooch to a veterinarian (James Harding) for a check-up. When his new owner leaves, Mooch is frightened by Dr. Hackett and bolts for the door, but is not able to catch up with Price driving away. After checking out the psychedelic scene where she meets Phyllis Diller, her wandering takes Mooch first to Dino's Lounge on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood and then to the Playboy Club in downtown Los Angeles. Rejected as a Playboy bunny, but still on the lookout for famous haunts, Mooch discovers Michaelangelo's Wigs where she has visions of a glamorous new look. Continuing on past the Classic Cat Club, Mooch encounters James Darren at an outdoor garage, and feigns an injury to get his attention. On a trip to the seashore, new adventures await with new friends. Hoping to land a contract, Mooch tags along with two girls being discovered by a producer Jerry Hausner. Ending up back at the veterinarian, Mooch joins a wild menagerie of animals waiting for Dr. Hackett. Placed in the veterinarian's kennel, Mooch makes his escape and heads for Paragon Studios. On his tour of the back lots, famous catch phrases waft through the air. After interrupting a wild west shooting scene, Mooch sneaks into the dressing room of Jill St. John. Taking her turn in the hairdresser's chair, the young starlet finds her way to a recording session with Jim Backus, playing Mr. Magoo and who needs a dog for an upcoming production. He becomes her next master, taking Mooch home to meet his wife Henny, and the many friends arriving for a garden party, including all of Mooch's former owners. Finally making one last attempt at achieving stardom, Mooch checks out a Hollywood estate and jumps aboard the owner's car. It turns out to be Dr. Hackett who ultimately adopts the stray.

The Jersey Shore sound evolved from the mixing of pre-Beatles rock and roll, rhythm and blues, doo-wop, and the urban culture of the Mid-Atlantic states. The form has a strong Italian-American influence inasmuch as many of the form's key precursors and artists, from Frankie Valli through Bruce Springsteen, are of Italian ancestry and urban background. Jersey Shore music shares two thematic elements with the genres of heartland rock and roots rock: A focus on the daily lives of people (in this case, those living in the stereotypically industrial society of the northeast United States, Northern and Central Jersey) and a sense of being the underdog (a theme in the genre from The Four Seasons' \\"Rag Doll\\", \\"Walk Like a Man\\", and \\"Big Man in Town\\" and through Springsteen's Dancing in the Dark)..

History Hetz was formed in the aftermath of the breakup of Shinui towards the end of the 16th Knesset. Avraham Poraz, Shinui's second-in-command after Tommy Lapid was unexpectedly beaten in the race to head the party's list for the 2006 elections by Ron Levintal. In response to the result, Poraz decided to break away from Shinui. He was joined by ten other Shinui MKs (out of a total of 15), including Lapid. They formed the Secular Faction on 26 January 2006, though on 5 February, Hemi Doron and Eliezer Sandberg left the new party to establish National Home. Poraz tried to set up Hetz as a new party in January 2006; however, it was too late to register a new party for the election. He tried to form a union with Tafnit, which rejected it. Eventually the party ran with the minor Citizen and State party, which was re-branded as Hetz for the elections. Lapid was presented as the honorary leader. However, a combination of the split with Shinui (who also ran in the elections with Levintal as head), the founding of centrist party Kadima and Shinui's lack of progress in implementing their agenda in the previous Knesset (despite being the second largest party in the coalition, hardly any of their campaign pledges had been realised) meant that the party had lost much of its supporter base. Ultimately the party won only 10,113 votes (0.33%), far below the 2% electoral threshold. Their only consolation was beating Shinui, who received only 4,675 votes (0.16%). Prior to the 2009 elections it was announced that the party would be running a joint list with the Greens, with Poraz receiving one of the top five places on the list. However, the agreement was later cancelled and Hetz did not run. In 2012 Hetz was taken over by Tzipi Livni to form the basis of the Hatnuah party, also inheriting the NIS 1.8 million in the party's bank account. Once seven MKs defected from Kadima and joined the party, Poraz announced that they now \\"represent Hetz in the Knesset\\". Ideology Hetz's policies mirrored those of Shinui in being centrist and liberal with a strong secular leaning. The party promised to introduce a constitution, separate religion and state, allow civil marriage and repeal many of the country's arrangements that they claim strongly benefit the Orthodox population (such as large child benefits (many Orthodox having 10 or more children), exemption from military service and payments to yeshivas).

Rieper was also a regular player in the Denmark national team, appearing in the Euro 1996 and 1998 FIFA World Cup tournaments. He is the older brother of footballer Mads Rieper. Career Club career Born in R√∏dovre, Rieper started his career at Danish club AGF in 1988. While at AGF, he debuted for the Danish national team in the 1‚Äì0 friendly match win against Sweden on 5 September 1990. He played a further three national team matches before moving on to Danish Superliga rivals Br√∏ndby IF in 1992. While at Br√∏ndby, he secured a place in the national team starting line-up and played 38 matches in a row from October 1992 to August 1996. Rieper won the 1994 Danish Cup trophy with Br√∏ndby before moving abroad in December that year to play for English Premiership club West Ham United, signing initially on loan before a ¬£1 million fee at the end of the season made the transfer permanent. In 1997, he moved to Scotland to play for Celtic, with whom he won the Scottish league championship in 1997-98. Rieper suffered a toe injury in October 1998 which he never fully recovered from. He did not make another professional appearance and announced his retirement in July 2000. International career Rieper played 61 matches and scored two goals for the Denmark national football team, first as the defensive partner of Lars Olsen and most prominently as part of a defending duo with Jes H√∏gh in the Euro 1996 and 1998 FIFA World Cup tournaments. He was ever-present for the Danish team which won the 1995 King Fahd Cup and played in all of Denmark's three matches at Euro 1996. At the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Rieper played full- time for the Danish national team, and scored against Saudi Arabia. Denmark's World Cup campaign ended in a quarter-final defeat to eventual runners-up Brazil. Post-playing career Following his retirement Rieper spent some time in 2001 as an assistant coach at AGF. Through his connections to Celtic, he brought over many reserve team players to AGF, including future Ireland international Liam Miller. After head coach John Stampe was fired in 2002, Rieper resigned from the club.

LDS Church members believe that the apostle Paul briefly described these degrees of glory in 1 Corinthians 15:40-42, and in 2 Corinthians 12:2. Joseph Smith elaborated on Paul's descriptions based primarily upon a vision he received with Sidney Rigdon in 1832 and recorded in Doctrine and Covenants (D&C;) section 76. According to this vision, all people will be resurrected and, at the Final Judgment, will be assigned to one of three degrees of glory, called the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms. A small number of individuals who commit the unpardonable sin will not receive a kingdom of glory, but will be banished to outer darkness with Satan where they will be \\"sons of Perdition\\". Doctrinal origin The three degrees of glory are most clearly described in of the D&C.; In the preface to section 76, the following explanatory text is given: Assignment to a particular kingdom in the resurrection is contingent upon the desires and actions exhibited during mortal and post-mortal life. The LDS Church teaches that these different kingdoms are what Jesus was referring to when he said \\"[i]n my Father's house are many mansions\\" (John 14:2). Additionally, the LDS Church teaches that 1 Corinthians 15:40‚Äì41 speaks of these three degrees of glory, comparing them with the glory of the sun, moon, and stars. The church's doctrine of the three degrees of glory is said to be consistent with a particular reading of Revelation 22:10‚Äì11, which says: However, this doctrine of three heavenly kingdoms also appears in the writings of St. Gregory of Sinai (1260s ‚Äì November 27, 1346) in his On Commandments and Doctrines: In addition to St. Gregory of Sinai, in the Byzantine tradition, St. Symeon Metaphrasis (late 10th c.) expounded a similar doctrine in Paraphrase of the Homilies of St. Makarios of Egypt: Celestial kingdom Celestial rooms in LDS temples represent the celestial kingdom The celestial kingdom is the highest of the three degrees of glory. It is thought by the LDS Church to be the \\"third heaven\\" referred to by the apostle Paul in the King James Version of 2 Corinthians 12:2 and it is said to correspond to the \\"celestial bodies\\" and \\"glory of the sun\\" mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:40‚Äì41. Inhabitants The celestial kingdom will be the residence of those who have been righteous, accepted the teachings of Jesus Christ, and made and lived up to all of the required ordinances and covenants.Joseph Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith (ed.) (1976). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 309: \\"All men who become heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ will have to receive the fulness of the ordinances of his kingdom; and those who will not receive all the ordinances will come short of the fulness of that glory\\"; see also p. 362, where Smith said that without temple ordinances \\"we cannot obtain celestial thrones.\\" Individuals may accept and receive these ordinances and covenants during their mortal lives. For those who did not have the opportunity while living, they will have the opportunity in the post-mortal spirit world, where they can accept ordinances performed on their behalf by LDS Church members in temples.Doctrine and Covenants 137:5‚Äì9. All children who die before the age of eight automatically inherit the celestial kingdom without the reception of ordinances.Doctrine and Covenants 137:10. The celestial kingdom is the permanent residence of God the Father and Jesus Christ.Doctrine and Covenants 76:62. Joseph Smith taught that \\"a white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial kingdom, whereon is a new name written, which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 130:11. This white stone will become a Urim and Thummim (or seer stone) to the recipient.Doctrine and Covenants 130:10. Relation of Highest Degree with Marriage Smith taught that only those individuals who are sealed in celestial marriage to a spouse will be permitted to enter into the highest degree of celestial glory.Doctrine and Covenants 131:2‚Äì4. These individuals will eventually become \\"exalted\\"Joseph Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith (ed.) (1976). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 348: \\"It will be a great while after you have [died] before you will have learned [all the principles of exaltation]. It is believed that this cannot be comprehended in the world; rather, it is said that the learning and understanding of salvation and exaltation will occur even beyond the grave.\\"Chapter 47: Exaltation\\", Gospel Principles, pp. 275‚Äì80. Like other ordinances, the sealing to a spouse may occur during mortal life or may be accepted by the parties in the afterlife and performed by proxy in a temple. Location Smith also taught that the earth will also receive a celestial glory.Joseph Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith (ed.) (1976). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 181: \\"This earth will be rolled back into the presence of God, and crowned with celestial glory.\\" Some church members believe that the earth will become the celestial kingdom.Doctrine and Covenants 88:14‚Äì26. Smith taught the earth, like the planet where God resides, will be \\"made like unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon\\".Doctrine and Covenants 130:6‚Äì9. Terrestrial kingdom The terrestrial kingdom is the middle of the three degrees of glory. It is believed by LDS Church members to correspond to the \\"bodies terrestrial\\" and \\"glory of the moon\\" mentioned by the apostle Paul in the King James Version translation of 1 Corinthians 15:40-41 15:40‚Äì41. The word \\"terrestrial\\" derives from a Latin word meaning \\"earthly\\".https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/terrestrial Inhabitants According to Doctrine and Covenants section 76, those who will inhabit the terrestrial kingdom include those who lived respectably but \\"were blinded by the craftiness of men\\" and thus rejected the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ when it was presented to them during their mortal lives.Doctrine and Covenants 76:75. It also includes persons who rejected the \\"testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it\\" in the spirit worldDoctrine and Covenants 76:74. and those who \\"are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus\\" after having received it.Doctrine and Covenants 76:79. Ultimately, the kingdom of glory (either the celestial or the terrestrial) received by those who accept the testimony of Jesus will be based on God's knowledge of whether they \\"would have received it with all their hearts\\" as manifested by their works and the \\"desire of their hearts\\".Doctrine and Covenants 137:8‚Äì9. Those who inherit the terrestrial kingdom \\"receive of the presence of the Son, but not the fulness of the Father.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 76:77. Smith taught that translated beings abide in the terrestrial kingdom until they are judged at the Final Judgment, after which they will enter into the celestial kingdom.Joseph Smith, Joseph Fielding Smith (ed.) (1976). Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book) p. 170: \\"Many have supposed that the doctrine of translation was a doctrine whereby men were taken immediately into the presence of God, and into an eternal fullness, but this is a mistaken idea. Their place of habitation is that of the terrestrial order\\". Telestial kingdom The telestial room of the Salt Lake Temple The telestial kingdom is the lowest of the three degrees of glory. It is believed by LDS Church members to correspond to the \\"glory of the stars\\" mentioned by the apostle Paul in the King James Version translation of 1 Corinthians 15:41. There are no known uses of the word \\"telestial\\" prior to its use by Smith. The prefix tele- in Greek translates into far or distant, although the remainder of the word remains ambiguous.https://www.etymonline.com/word/tele-https://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/tele Inhabitants According to the book of Doctrine and Covenants, those who will inhabit the telestial kingdom include those \\"who received not the gospel of Christ, nor the testimony of Jesus.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 76:82. It will also include \\"liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers, and whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie\\", as well as \\"murderers, and idolaters\\".Doctrine and Covenants 76:103; see also Revelation 22:15. Because of their refusal to accept Jesus as their Savior, these individuals will remain in spirit prison for 1,000 years during the millennial reign of Christ.Doctrine and Covenants 76:84, 105‚Äì06; \\"Chapter 46: The Final Judgment\\", Gospel Principles, p. 294. After the 1000 years, the individuals will be resurrected and receive an immortal physical body and be assigned to the telestial kingdom.Doctrine and Covenants 88:100‚Äì01. Smith taught that individuals in the telestial kingdom will be servants of God, but \\"where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds without end\\";Doctrine and Covenants 76:112. however, they will receive the ministration of the Holy Ghost and beings from the terrestrial kingdom.Doctrine and Covenants 76:86. Despite these limitations, in LDS Church theology being resident in the telestial kingdom is not an unpleasant experience: \\"the glory of the telestial ... surpasses all understanding\\".Doctrine and Covenants 76:89. Smith also taught that just as there are different degrees of glory within the celestial kingdom (D&C; 131:1‚Äì4), there are different degrees of glory within the telestial kingdom. He stated that \\"as one star differs from another star in glory, even so differs one from another in the telestial world.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 76:98; see also 1 Corinthians 15:41. In the telestial kingdom, each person's glory will vary depending on their works while on the earth.Doctrine and Covenants 76:109‚Äì11; see also Bruce R. McConkie (1966). Mormon Doctrine (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 778‚Äì79. Smith and Rigdon stated, \\"we saw the glory and the inhabitants of the telestial world, that they were as innumerable as the stars in the firmament of heaven, or as the sand upon the seashore\\".Doctrine and Covenants 76:109. One Latter-day Saint commentator has suggested that by implication this means that \\"most of the adult people who have lived from the day of Adam to the present time will go to the telestial kingdom.\\"Bruce R. McConkie (1966). Mormon Doctrine (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 778. Role in temple ordinances During the original endowment temple ordinance, church members moved between ordinance rooms that represented the three different kingdoms of glory. In most newer LDS temples, the majority of the moves between rooms have been replaced with changes in lighting to represent changes from one degree of glory to the next. In some of the church's older temples (e.g., the Salt Lake, Manti Utah, and Cardston Alberta temples), the classic version of the endowment ceremony is still done by moving from room to room. Every LDS temple includes a celestial room‚Äîrepresenting the celestial kingdom‚Äîthat is separate from the other ordinance rooms. Hypothesized influence of Emanuel Swedenborg Some, including Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn in his book Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, have argued that various parts of the Mormon plan of salvation were influenced in part by Emanuel Swedenborg's book Heaven and Hell. In Heaven and Hell, Swedenborg wrote that \\"[t]here are three heavens\\" that are \\"entirely distinct from each other.\\"Emanuel Swedenborg, \\"Heaven and its Wonders and Hell From Things Heard and Seen\\". (2001 translation) and (1958 translation). Swedenborg called the highest heaven \\"the Celestial Kingdom.\\" He also stated that the inhabitants of the three heavens corresponded to the \\"sun, moon and stars.\\" While some historians believe Smith was familiar with Swedenborg's theology at least by 1839, others have argued that he did not have access to the writings of Swedenborg.Hamblin, William J. \\"That Old Black Magic.\\" FARMS Review 12.2 (2000): 225-394. The Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship. 1 December 2009. One of Smith's preeminent biographers has argued it is more likely that Smith and Swedenborg developed their ideas independently based on 1 Corinthians chapter 15.Richard Lyman Bushman, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A.

He was portrayed by Forest Whitaker. Kavanaugh's career before the investigation Kavanaugh was an Internal Affairs Department (IAD) Lieutenant determined to take down Detective Vic Mackey and his Strike Team using any means at his disposal. He has been described as the toughest adversary the Team ever faced, and his investigation led to their ultimate downfall. Before being promoted to Lieutenant, Kavanaugh took a spot in IAD after breaking the blue code of silence on his former partner. He has degrees in both criminology and psychology, and frequently played mind games with people under surveillance to find out whether they'd \\"crack under pressure\\". Kavanaugh showed little or no sympathy for the sufferings his investigation caused to Vic's ex-wife Corrine. Kavanaugh treated her with self-righteous contempt, froze her assets, and mocked her genuine grief over Vic's crimes. When a heartbroken Corrine demanded to know why he was treating her like a criminal, Kavanaugh said coldly, \\"You married the wrong man, Corrine.\\" Personality A self-righteous and narcissistic careerist, Lieutenant Kavanaugh's investigation of Vic Mackey and the Strike Team was initiated by LAPD Chief Johnson's desire to prosecute, \\"a posterboy for corruption\\". By spinning the news to the Department's advantage, Chief Johnson could then ensure that the next funding bill would pass the legislature, and by giving the Chief what he wanted, Kavanaugh hoped to be promoted. Kavanaugh revealed himself to be a determined and resolute investigator, sometimes to the point of obsession. He also had manic tendencies and would throw violent tantrums when confronted with facts he didn't want to hear or when his plans failed to work out as intended. From the beginning of his investigation, Kavanaugh found himself repeatedly outmaneuvered and humiliated by his primary target, Mackey. This threat to Kavanaugh's oversized ego caused his pursuit of Vic to become personal. After learning that Vic had slept with his ex-wife, Kavanaugh abandoned all restraint and began breaking the law himself. Following the subsequent murder of Strike Team Detective Curtis Lemansky, Kavanaugh was certain Vic was responsible. In his obsession with sending Vic to jail, Kavanaugh began to resemble Captain Ahab chasing the White Whale. In the process, Kavanaugh committed sexual assault, planted evidence, and pressured witnesses to commit perjury. These crimes ultimately caused him to lose his badge, his pension, and his freedom. Family Kavanaugh was once married to a woman named Sadie (Gina Torres), but the two were divorced as a result of her severe mental illness and his unwillingness to continue taking care of her. Despite this, he continued to wear his wedding ring and, for a long time, remained in love with her. At one point, Sadie faked being raped as a means of reuniting with Kavanaugh. When Kavanaugh learned the truth, she pleaded with him to bend the rules for her, saying she loved him and wanted to come home. Kavanaugh refused, saying he could not bend the rules for her. He arranged for her to be charged with filing a false police report and remanded to a state psychiatric ward. An enraged Sadie retaliated by engaging in a torrid sexual encounter with Vic Mackey and lewdly taunting her ex-husband with the details. Investigation of the Strike Team Kavanaugh begins his investigation by targeting Mackey's ex-wife, Corrine. However, she becomes suspicious and describes him to Vic, who shows her Kavanaugh's photo and tells her Kavanaugh's IAD. Under pressure from Kavanaugh, who threatens to arrest her if she doesn't cooperate, she begins assisting the investigation. Also pressured by Kavanaugh, Lem, who was caught not turning in heroin after a bust, reluctantly agrees to wear a wire to uncover evidence on Vic. Through this, Kavanaugh discovers a plot to traffic pharmaceutical drugs to the Russian Mafia and take money under the table. When it appears the deal has gone through and that Vic has murdered one of the players, Kavanaugh's task force swoops in and handcuffs the team, only to discover they have unwittingly destroyed a top secret sting operation. Kavanaugh later learns that his bugging of the Strike Team's \\"clubhouse\\" has been discovered and used to feed him false information. Now even more determined to put the team away, Kavanaugh sets up shop in \\"The Barn\\", commandeering the Captain's office and plastering it with graphic photos of the Terry Crowley murder scene. He tries to guilt Vic into confessing by forcing him to revisit the scene and describe to Terry's weeping brother what happened. Vic is unfazed, however, and calmly sticks to his original story. Kavanaugh approaches imprisoned drug lord and cop killer Antwon Mitchell. Antwon offers Kavanugh more than enough information to destroy the Strike Team, but only if Vic, Lem, Ronnie, and Shane are sent to \\"his\\" prison so he can murder them. Disgusted, Kavanaugh refuses his offer. Kavanaugh then widens the investigation to include Councilman David Aceveda for alleged collusion with Mackey and The Strike Team. During a raid on a Salvadoran hand grenade factory, Lem heroically saves Kavanaugh from an active grenade tossed in his direction by throwing it away seconds before it exploded. Kavanaugh responds by continuing to pressure Lem into testifying against Vic Mackey. Lem indignantly refuses to turn against Mackey. Later, Vic angrily confronts Kavanaugh about his treatment of Lem. However, the raid had come shortly before Kavanaugh's meeting with his ex- wife, Sadie. Vic and Lem enter the security monitor room after noticing the Lieutenant's obvious distress, and watch the ensuing conversation between Kavanaugh and his distraught, mentally ill ex-wife. Viewing their disturbing confrontation via closed-circuit television, Vic remarks that they have found Kavanaugh's weakness. Kavanaugh eventually notices that the security camera in the room is turned on. Realizing his conversation with his wife is being observed by his enemies leads him to rush out of the interrogation room in a rage. Vic simply looks him in the eyes and smiles smugly. The now outraged Kavanaugh decides to leave Lem with no choice other than to testify against Vic. He orders Detective Lemansky to be arrested for possession of heroin with intent to distribute. As Vic and his fellow officers watch in horror, Lem is handcuffed by Julien Lowe, on Kavanaugh's orders, placed in lockup with civilian criminals, processed, and sent to a detention center. That same evening, Kavanaugh visits Antwon and accepts his deal. The incident Shortly thereafter, Vic visits Sadie's residence. Originally intending to milk her for information, he changes his plans after Sadie sexually propositions him. Vic waits until the next time Kavanaugh taunts him with his coming downfall and quips: > Allow me to remind you of a few things you may have forgotten: I didn't kill > Terry, you've lost your leverage over Lem, and your ex-wife's pussy tastes > like sweet butter. Horrified, Kavanaugh rushes to his ex-wife's house and demands to know whether it is true, only to have Sadie respond: > What did Vic Mackey do? He made me cum... Twice. Lem's bail and a rape attempt Enraged, Kavanaugh tries to take vengeance by seducing Vic's ex-wife Corrine. However, she rejects him, disgusted by his treatment of her in the past. Kavanaugh then tries to rape her, but cannot bring himself to go through with it. Also determined to prevent the Team from paying Lem's bail and to force Lem to testify against the team, Kavanaugh freezes all their assets and those of their dependents, including those of Corrine Mackey. Vic, however, is still determined and waits for the next search warrant to be executed on a drug dealer's house. Instead of allowing the search to go through, the Strike Team breaks into the house, steals the drug dealer's money, and leaves seconds before their fellow cops arrive. Knowing that paying the bail himself would attract Kavanaugh's attention, Vic arranges for it to be paid by the Team's old friend, Smitty. Deadline Despite all of his maneuvering, Kavanaugh's investigation is destroyed by external factors. In a move to seal the other three members of the Strike Team off from prosecution, Lem pleads guilty to theft under color of authority, agreeing to serve 18 months before parole of a 5-year sentence. The Department brass and the District Attorney, annoyed with the expense of paying for Kavanaugh's task force and the lack of progress in the case, decide to accept. In a desperate attempt to change the Chief's mind, Kavanaugh inadvertently reveals that destroying Vic has become more important than his job. He angrily protests to Chief Johnson, who gently tells him: > It's over, Jon. Sending Lemansky to jail sends a message and we all move on. Seething with hatred, Kavanaugh snarls:: > Mackey skates clean? This guy is pissing all over us. And we just smile, and > lick it up? Assistant Chief Roy Phillips interrupts him, saying: \\"That's enough.\\" However, the Chief of Police bristles as Kavanaugh dramatically points to the crime scene photos of Terry Crowley and screams: > Vic Mackey kills cops! He... he deals drugs! He beats suspects! You know > what he did yesterday? He... he screwed my ex-wife with the sole purpose of > making this investigation seem like a personal vendetta. He may have > assassinated a gang leader. And that's just all in one day. I wonder what > he's going to do today. I wonder what he's going to do tomorrow. This guy... > this guy is just pissing... he's pissing all over us. He's pissing on you. > What does it taste like? Chief, what does it taste like, 'cause you know > what, it tastes like piss to me! Chief Johnson icily responds: > You have 48 hours to tie up the loose ends, and find someplace else to do > the paperwork. Captain Wyms needs her office. Investigation collapse However, Lem does not report for processing, and Kavanaugh is overjoyed to be given one final chance to crush his nemesis. Correctly presuming that Vic is harboring Lem, he attempts to have the Strike Team arrested for aiding and abetting a fugitive. He has the Team followed at all times and even persuades Aceveda to leak false information to Vic, saying Lem has revealed the Strike Team's involvement in the Armenian Money Train robbery. Kavanaugh also deliberately sabotages Vic's arrangement with Antwon Mitchell, which was meant to keep Lem alive while serving his prison term. Kavanaugh confronts the imprisoned drug lord, enraging him to the point that Antwon vows to kill Lem no matter which prison Lem is sent to. Kavanaugh also has the Team trailed when they are to meet Lem, but is unable to follow all three of them. His tails are easily shaken, but Kavanaugh soon receives a phone call advising that Lem has been blown apart by a hand grenade, presumably by the Salvadoran drug cartel led by Guardo Lima. When the body is discovered, Kavanaugh and Mackey come face to face once more. Kavanaugh is certain that Vic has again murdered a fellow officer and believes that all his hatred of his nemesis is completely justified. He looks at Vic demanding to know: > Are you happy now, Detective Mackey? Vic, however, is completely devastated by a murder he had nothing to do with and tackles Kavanaugh with a scream of outraged fury. The two enemies brawl across the crime scene, with Vic getting the upper hand, until their fellow officers pull them apart. Kavanaugh glares balefully as he watches Mackey walk away. Meanwhile, Vic gestures toward Lem's body and snarls: > We're gonna find whoever did this, and we're gonna kill 'em. Kavanaugh's final charge With Lem now dead and his career and reputation soiled, Kavanaugh is ordered by Chief Johnson to leave the Barn and allow the investigation of Lem's murder to proceed. Kavanaugh pleads for time to look into Vic's possible involvement. Assistant Chief Phillips grudgingly grants him 24 hours to write a report for consideration. However, upon arriving at the Barn, Kavanaugh immediately tells Vic: > You cannot deny that you murdered two of your own Team members! This instantly sets off another brawl. The fight is broken up, but is witnessed by Phillips and Captain Wyms. Kavanaugh is ordered to leave the Barn immediately, his investigation apparently over. Nothing now matters to Kavanaugh except destroying Mackey. Changing tactics, Kavanaugh informs Claudette and Chief Phillips that Vic had hired the Salvadoran drug dealers who murdered Lem, using Emolia Melendez as a go-between. This grants him a temporary reprieve. After Emolia agrees to follow the story in exchange for witness protection, she testifies to Claudette and Phillips about the false details of Vic's involvement. Kavanaugh is authorized to investigate Vic's involvement and begins by ordering officers to await Vic at his home to take him in for questioning. However, Vic pays a visit to the Lieutenant's residence, taunting him by saying: > You are entering a whole new playing field, my friend. I hope you know the > rules. Kavanaugh responds by breaking into Vic's house and planting several pieces of \\"evidence\\" to further solidify the murder charge. Kavanaugh's downfall Kavanaugh soon senses that not everyone believes his story. After hearing Emolia's testimony, Dutch expresses skepticism about her story and requests further corroborating evidence. He later suggests that the \\"evidence\\" found in Vic's house is simply too good to be true. In an attempt to protect his case, Kavanaugh requests that Dutch be removed from the investigation, citing that Dutch's past relationship with Vic's ex-wife may have resulted in a conflict of interest. Then, however, Corrine Mackey learns of the charges against her ex-husband and angrily confronts Kavanaugh, formally accusing him of sexual assault. When Claudette asks Dutch for his opinion, he expresses skepticism about Corrine's allegations, suggesting the rape attempt only happened in her own mind. He further voices his growing doubts about Kavanaugh's case, questioning whether Vic would murder a close friend under any circumstances. Claudette tells him her belief that \\"only the truth can save this place.\\" Together, they begin to take a good hard look at Emolia's story. Claudette tears into Emolia in the interrogation room, saying she should feel ashamed of letting herself become a pawn in the war between Vic and Kavanaugh. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh realizes what he has become. He stops Claudette and confesses to planting the evidence, saying: > I framed a guilty man, laughing at the irony of it all. Kavanaugh is immediately stripped of his badge and imprisoned for his many crimes. He later pleads guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence. Taking a break from his mission to wreak bloody revenge on Lem's killer, Vic pays Kavanaugh a visit in prison. Although Vic taunts him about having lost both his moral compass and their private war, Kavanaugh remains unfazed. He responds that he is now at peace and finally free of Vic's corrupting influence. He adds: > One day the Universe will take out its trash. Vic smiles and responds: > Looks like it already has. Reception According to the show's creator Shawn Ryan, > If I said to you: I'm going to have a story about a corrupt cop who murdered > another cop and stole a bunch of money.

A host may work as a server offering information resources, services, and applications to users or other hosts on the network. Hosts are assigned at least one network address. A computer participating in networks that use the Internet protocol suite may also be called an IP host. Specifically, computers participating in the Internet are called Internet hosts. Internet hosts and other IP hosts have one or more IP addresses assigned to their network interfaces. The addresses are configured either manually by an administrator, automatically at startup by means of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), or by stateless address autoconfiguration methods. Network hosts that participate in applications that use the client‚Äìserver model of computing, are classified as server or client systems. Network hosts may also function as nodes in peer-to-peer applications, in which all nodes share and consume resources in an equipotent manner. Origins In operating systems, the term terminal host denotes a time-sharing computer or multi-user software providing services to computer terminals, or a computer that provides services to smaller or less capable devices, such as a mainframe computer serving teletype terminals or video terminals. Other examples of this architecture include a telnet host connected to a telnet server and an xhost connected to an X Window client. The term Internet host or just host is used in a number of Request for Comments (RFC) documents that define the Internet and its predecessor, the ARPANET. RFC 871 defines a host as a general-purpose computer system connected to a communications network for \\"... the purpose of achieving resource sharing amongst the participating operating systems...\\" While the ARPANET was being developed, computers connected to the network were typically mainframe computer systems that could be accessed from dumb terminals connected via serial ports. Since these terminals did not host software or perform computations themselves, they were not considered hosts as they were not connected to any IP network, and were not assigned IP addresses. Nodes, hosts, and servers A network node is any device participating in a network. A host is a node that participates is user applications, either as a server, client, or both. A server is a type of host that offers resources to the other hosts. Typically a server accepts connections from clients who request a service function. Every network host is a node, but not every network node is a host. Network infrastructure hardware, such as modems, Ethernet hubs, and network switches are not directly or actively participating in application- level functions, and do not necessarily have a network address, and are not considered to be network hosts.

Often referred to as the \\"prince of full-backs\\" due to his sportsmanship, Spencer joined Aston Villa in 1892 having played for several clubs at amateur level. He made his professional debut in October 1894 at the age of 18 and would go on to become a first-team regular for the club. In his 13 years as a senior player, he helped the side to three First Division championships and three FA Cup victories as well as earning six caps at international level for England. Early life Born in Edgbaston, Spencer was one of seven children and attended Albert Road School in nearby Aston. His father Josh was an oil merchant. Career Spencer played local amateur football for a number of clubs in his local area before joining Football League First Division side Aston Villa from Birchfield Trinity in April 1892 as an amateur, turning professional two years later in June 1894. He made his debut for the club four months later on 13 October 1894 during a 3‚Äì1 victory over their West Midlands rivals West Bromwich Albion. At the end of his first season with the club, Spencer played in the 1895 FA Cup Final victory over West Brom at the age of 18 and, the following season, helped Villa to win the First Division title. He spent 13 years with Villa, taking the 1901‚Äì02 season off in order to rest his knee and ankle for twelve months in the hope of recovering from an injury. Over the course of his career, Spencer gained a reputation as a fair player and was well known for his good sportsmanship which earnt him the nickname the \\"prince of full-backs\\". He announced his retirement from football at the end of the 1906‚Äì07 season but offered to play for the club in future if needed. This offer was taken up by Villa in November 1907 when Spencer played in three league matches, his final appearance for the club coming on 30 November 1907 against Newcastle United. During his time with the club, he made 294 appearances in all competitions, scoring 2 goals. Following his retirement, Spencer became a successful coal merchant and joined the Aston Villa's board of directors in 1909 and served as a director until 1936. He later also served as vice-president of the club. Spencer made his international debut for England on 29 March 1897 in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Wales. He retained his place in the team for their following fixture on 3 April 1897, a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Scotland, going on to win a total of six caps. He first captained England in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Ireland in February 1903, becoming the first Aston Villa player to captain England in the club's history.

History Luminar Group Holdings plc was established in 1988, with the opening of its first nightclub, Manhattan Nitespot in King's Lynn, Norfolk. The continued growth in the discotheque division and the creation of the popular Chicago Rock Cafe concept meant Luminar became a successful leisure company of the early 1990s.The Makings of Luminar, The Luminar Staff and Shareholder Handbook, 2005, page 1. It floated on the stock exchange in May 1996. There was a large expansion of Chicago Rock Cafes in the late 1990s. Luminar also ran and owned a couple of themed Australian restaurants, Tuckers Smokehouse, which opened at Kettering in Northamptonshire and Chelmsford in Essex. From August 1999 there were discussions with Northern Leisure about a possible merger. In November 1999, Luminar bought twenty nightclubs and seven bars from Allied Leisure for ¬£34m. Luminar bought Northern Leisure in May 2000 for ¬£392m with a combined total of 237 nightclubs and late-night bars. In 2001 it opened 41 new venues, 44 in 2002, and 30 in 2003. In November 2003, it consolidated its range of nightclub brands into the four main divisions ‚Äì Oceana, Liquid, Life and Lava-Ignite. In June 2005, it sold 49 nightclubs to a management buyout, which became CanDu Entertainment for ¬£27m (which was later bought by Agilo in March 2008 after entering administration in March 2008). Luminar sold the Entertainment division that included the Jumpin Jaks and Chicago Rock Cafe brands to 3D Entertainment in December 2006 for ¬£79m, in a sale and leaseback deal. Luminar Group Holdings plc was placed into liquidation on 26 October 2011. Luminar Group Ltd was incorporated on 5 December 2011 and headed up by former managing director Peter Marks, retaining the brands and most of the venues the previous company operated. The Luminar Group Limited acquired both Chicago Leisure Limited and Chicago Leisure (MK) Limited on 7 November 2014. On 17 May 2015, The Luminar Group was rebranded as The Deltic Group Limited, with their recent expansion into the late bar market.

After service as a soldier in World War I, where he learnt surveying skills, he worked as a gramophone salesman, a postman, and later a security guard, but always his main interest was archaeology. He was a key member of the Worthing Archaeological Society. He was responsible for the finding and excavation of some of the most important neolithic sites in Southern Britain including the flint mines at Blackpatch, Harrow Hill, Church Hill, Cissbury in Sussex, England, in 1922. Because he was not a professional archaeologist, he was unpopular with some of the experts in the field at the time, who constantly shrugged off Pull's work as amateur and unimportant. In the end, much of Pull's work and findings were given to Worthing Museum and Art Gallery which holds a large archive. The main results of the Pull's excavations at Blackpatch, Church Hill and Cissbury between 1922 and 1956 housed in the archive were finally published in 2001 by Miles Russell of Bournemouth University.Miles Russell (ed) 2001 Rough Quarries Rocks and Hills: John Pull and the Neolithic Flint Mines of Sussex, Oxbow Books (Oxford) Sadly, the earthworks comprising his first investigated site at Blackpatch were bulldozed over in the 1950s.

It branches from the external carotid artery just deep to the neck of the mandible. Structure The maxillary artery, the larger of the two terminal branches of the external carotid artery, arises behind the neck of the mandible, and is at first imbedded in the substance of the parotid gland; it passes forward between the ramus of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, and then runs, either superficial or deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle, to the pterygopalatine fossa. It supplies the deep structures of the face, and may be divided into mandibular, pterygoid, and pterygopalatine portions. First portion The first or mandibular portion (or bony portion) passes horizontally forward, between the neck of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, where it lies parallel to and a little below the auriculotemporal nerve; it crosses the inferior alveolar nerve, and runs along the lower border of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Branches include: * Deep auricular artery * Anterior tympanic artery * Middle meningeal artery * Inferior alveolar artery which gives off its mylohyoid branch just prior to entering the mandibular foramen * Accessory meningeal artery Second portion The second or pterygoid portion (or muscular portion) runs obliquely forward and upward under cover of the ramus of the mandible and insertion of the temporalis, on the superficial (very frequently on the deep) surface of the lateral pterygoid muscle; it then passes between the two heads of origin of this muscle and enters the fossa. Branches include: * Masseteric artery * Pterygoid branches * Deep temporal arteries (anterior and posterior) * Buccal artery Third portion The third or pterygomaxillary portion lies in the pterygopalatine fossa in relation with the pterygopalatine ganglion. This is considered the terminal branch of the maxillary artery.

The strong traditions of choral singing, village bands, and folk music are nurtured both by the Italian as well as German speakers of the area. Musical venues and activities Trentino Historically, of course, the city of Trento has given its name to the Council of Trent, the conclave that started the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation in the mid-16th century. The city had, thus, a somewhat austere reputation as not being particularly given to the beginnings of commercial music and public theaters or other activities beyond the confines of ecclesiastical music. The first commercial theatrical and musical ventures had to await the years following the incorporation of the region into the short-lived French satrapy called the Republic of Lombardy, set up by Napoleon in 1796. Even though that political entity did not survive Napoleon, himself, the anti-clerical social forces set in motion did. Thus, the first theater and public musical venue in the city of Trento was the Teatro Mazzurana (later renamed the Teatro Sociale), opened in 1819. For many years, it was the only venue for music or theater in the city. Failing fortunes led to its closure in 1983, but it was refurbished and reopened in the year 2000. It is now one of four auditoriums in the city, with the Auditorium, the Sperimentale, and the San Marco theater. The city is also the site of the Bonporti music conservatory, which hosts an annual Mondi Sonori (Worlds of Sound) festival as well as the International Antonio Pedrotti Orchestral Conducting Competition. The nearby town of Ala is the site of the Antique Piano Museum. It is a private museum, housed on the premises of the Palazzo de' Pizzini-di Lenna, an edifice from the 17th century and one that has also housed names such as Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, Mozart, and Napoleon. The museum specializes not just in conserving the instruments, but in restoring them to historically accurate and playable condition. The town of Rovereto, too, is astride the old Vienna-to-Italy trail; it has a number of its own \\"Mozart played here\\" landmarks and hosts an annual Mozart Festival. The Ancient Music Society of the city also hosts a rather unusual music competition involving performances on original, historical instruments. The town of Riva del Garda (on Lake Garda) has a music conservatory and hosts the annual Garda Music Festival.  South Tyrol  South Tyrol () is the name of the other half of this region. The main town is Bolzano. Besides the New Communal Theater, the city boasts the Claudio Monteverdi music conservatory and the Konzerthaus.

Background and role in genocide  Sagahutu was born in Cyangugu Province, Rwanda. Sagahutu entered the Rwandan Armed Forces, and by 1994 held the rank of captain. He was second-in-command of the Reconnaissance Battalion (RECCE) and commander of this battalion's A company, serving under battalion commander Major Fran√ßois-Xavier Nzuwonemeye.ICTR Indictment of September 25, 2002, at ¬∂¬∂ 1.15-1.17. According to the indictment, between 1990 and 1994, Sagahutu and other officers conspired to exterminate Tutsi civilians and political opponents, and helped to train interahamwe and militia groups who committed the genocide. They distributed weapons and prepared lists of people to be eliminated.Indictment ¬∂¬∂ 4.1, 4.23. After the death of President Juv√©nal Habyarimana in April 1994 and the start of the genocide, soldiers including those under Sagahutu's command assaulted and killed Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and a number of important opposition leaders, and murdered ten Belgian soldiers who were guarding the Prime Minister.Indictment ¬∂ 5.7. The indictment accused Sagahutu and the four other defendants of conspiring to perpetrate genocide, mass rape, sexual assault, and murder; of giving the orders that led to these crimes; and of doing nothing to stop the crimes when they took place.  After the genocide  Sagahutu fled Rwanda after the RPF victory. He was arrested in the Danish town of Skjern in Ringk√∏bing County, on February 15, 2000. He had lived in Denmark for approximately two years as a refugee. At the time of his arrest, his neighbours described him as a \\"good family man\\" who lived a comfortable and quiet life with his wife and their two children, an eight- year-old-boy and a twelve-year-old daughter, who both spoke Danish and were enrolled in a local school. He was arrested while \\"he bicycled home from shopping for groceries in a nearby supermarket.\\" He was transferred to the authority of the ICTR on November 24, 2000, and his trial began on September 20, 2004. In May 2011, Sagahutu and other ringleaders were convicted, and Sagahutu was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Sagahutu's sentence was reduced to 15 years on appeal, and he was granted an early release in may 2014. Innocent Sagahutu was detained on March 10, 2017 in the Tanzanian district of Ngara while preparing to cross the border into Burundi. The former army officer told the Tanzanian newspaper The Citizen that he wanted to visit relatives living in Burundi. But according to the Tanzanian immigration services, he had no document authorizing him to leave Tanzania. Sagahutu told The Citizen that it was not true, saying that he had the proper documents released by the UN in Tanzania and that he had recently traveled to Mozambique and Switzerland with the same documents. However, a spokesman for (MICT), which has been carrying out residual functions of the ICTR since its closure in December 2015, denied this claim. Claiming that they did not provide him with any document authorizing him to leave Tanzania and that they had no authority to grant him such documents, Sagahutu was eventually released on May 1 of that year.https://www.justiceinfo.net/en/tribunals/ictr/33223-rwanda- tribunal-ex-convict-tries-to-go-to-burundi.html  Notes  References *Prosecutor v.
