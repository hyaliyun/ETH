It is administratively part of the Gornji Grad - Medve≈°ƒçak city district in the northern part of Zagreb and it has a population of 1,929. ≈†alata houses the ≈†alata Sport and Recreation Center (≈†RC ≈†alata) and the University Hospital Centre Zagreb (KBC Zagreb). The neighborhood is located east of Medve≈°ƒçak Road, the main thoroughfare of its parent city district, on the gentle slopes of the Medvednica. Due to its hilly nature, ≈†alata is approximately above downtown Zagreb. The residents of ≈†alata are close to almost all major events outside the neighborhoods due to their proximity to both the old city cores of Gornji Grad and Kaptol, and the current center, Donji Grad. ≈†alata is praised for great views of the city because of its higher altitude in relation to the rest of the city and its position on some of the southernmost hills of Medvednica. Due to these factors, real estate in ≈†alata is relatively expensive compared with other districts, which made it become home to many influential people from the political, musical and sports scene in Croatia.  Geography  New development on Baboniƒáeva Street ≈†alata was quickly urbanized in the early and mid-20th century following a rapid expansion of Zagreb. The urbanization can be explained by its prime location on the slopes of the Medvednica Mountain and its proximity to the Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square. Nonetheless, the neighborhood retains an environmentally friendly image, housing the botanical garden \\"Fran Ku≈°an\\" in Zagreb, owned by the faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry of the University of Zagreb. The garden is located at the end of the quiet Schrottova Street. Although only in area, the garden contains over 2,000 plant species. ≈†alata's mass transit consists of four bus lines: numbers 106, 201, 226 and 238. All the lines run along Gr≈°koviƒáeva Street and Bijeniƒçka Road up to the Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá Institute. At this point 106 and 226 continue northwest towards the Mirogoj and the rest continue northeast along the Bijeniƒçka Road. The southeastern part remains away from bus routes, so the City of Zagreb administration deems ≈†alata badly connected to the rest of the city, and plans to add more bus lines. The neighborhood does not have any tram lines, so its inhabitants have to either descend by staircases to nearby arterial roads, or take the bus to Kaptol near Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square to reach the nearest tram stations. On 31 January 2009, the minibus line 204 was assigned to ≈†alata. It runs on a circular route between Kvaternik Square and the eastern parts of the neighborhood. Baboniƒáeva Street, connected to the rest of ≈†alata only by staircases, has recently experienced a rise in construction of luxury apartment buildings three or four stories high, and is the first in Croatia to feature digital homes. The new development has been criticized, though, because the houses are located in a canyon, which allows their roofs to be seen from nearby streets. Baboniƒáeva Street used to be a cul-de-sac, but was enlarged upon the construction of apartment buildings at the expense of some orchards owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb, which had a church nearby. The enlargement was envisioned already in 1988 by the architect Branko Kincl, but the street extension started only in the mid-2000s. History ≈†alata was built along several arterial roads: Bijeniƒçka Road, Voƒáarska Road and Gr≈°koviƒáeva Street. The first development occurred around ≈†alata Street, near today's School of Medicine in the southwest part of the neighborhood. As the city grew, the neighborhood expanded northward. This created garbled street patterns in the south, but led to straight north-south streets and random east-west connectors north of Gr≈°koviƒáeva Street. East of Voƒáarska and Bijeniƒçka Street the neighborhood is located on steep slopes and canyons, generating long, steep north-south streets connected by staircases. The most expensive houses are primarily located along the major thoroughfares, which tend not to exhibit much traffic due to the ≈†alata's proximity of Medve≈°ƒçak Road, the main route to the northernmost parts of Zagreb. In the southern part of the neighborhood is the Voƒáarsko naselje, a small, but densely built neighborhood that has become a sort of a microdistrict on its own. It is not as expensive due to little road access and parking problems. It was built in 1962 and the residents moved in during 1964. It also contains a kindergarten.Urbanistiƒçko-arhitektonska obilje≈æja Voƒáarskog naselja u Zagrebu, I. Mlinar, J. Horvat ≈†alata used to be a village where farmers used to hold cattle and produce dairy products for the farmers' market in the city. At the beginning of the 20th century, the city spread north and the area was rapidly urbanized and became known as ≈†alata around the 1920s. Between 1945 and 1952, ≈†alata was a part of the 2nd raion. After 1945 the 2nd raion became the Medve≈°ƒçak municipality and ≈†alata formally became a neighborhood. Up until 1990 the definition of a neighborhood was coded by city ordinances, at which point Croatia separated from the rest of the then existing Yugoslavia and neighborhood definitions were scrapped. ≈†alata again became an informal division of the Gornji Grad ‚Äì Medve≈°ƒçak city district. Today, the neighborhood consists mostly of single-family homes or mansions and small three- or four-story luxury apartment buildings with apartments usually stretching one or two stories. Real estate prices are currently increasing due to the neighborhood being close to most city amenities.  Education and research  Archbishop Classic Gymnasium on Voƒáarska Road Most of ≈†alata and the surrounding neighborhoods are zoned to the Ivan Goran Kovaƒçiƒá elementary school, located near the center of the neighborhood in Mesiƒáeva Street. While there is no high school zoning in Zagreb, the 18th Gymnasium, known for its bilingual classes, shares the building with the elementary school. The Archdiocesan Classical Gymnasium () is located nearby on Voƒáarska Road. As for tertiary education, ≈†alata hosts Faculties of Science (Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Geophysics, Geology and Chemistry) and the Zagreb School of Medicine of the University of Zagreb. Due to this, ≈†alata is regarded as one of the educational and scientific centers of Zagreb. The Interdiocesan Boys' Seminary () is located on Voƒáarska Road, near the church of Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Archdiocesan Classical Gymnasium.Zagreb: Proslava 75. obljetnice meƒëu biskupijskog sjemeni≈°ta i nadbiskupske klasiƒçne gimnazije The Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá Institute is located on Bijeniƒçka Street in the far north of the neighborhood. Another notable institute in ≈†alata is the Croatian Institute for Brain Research, which is located on the grounds of the ≈†alata hospital in Mesiƒáeva Street.  Culture  \\"Fran Ku≈°an\\" botanical garden in Schrottova Street The neighborhood is a cultural center of the Gornji Grad ‚Äì Medve≈°ƒçak city district. It houses two privately owned theaters: Mala scena at the intersection of Gr≈°koviƒáeva Street and Medve≈°ƒçak Road, and ≈Ωar ptica on the far northern part of Bijeniƒçka Road. In addition to this, ≈†alata is renowned for being the home of many influential Croatian artists, such as sculptor Vanja Radau≈°, who owned an atelier on Zmajevac Street and painter Vasilije Jordan. ≈†alata is widely known throughout Zagreb for its festivals, including ≈†alata Open Air Festival, INmusic festival, concerts on the ≈†RC ≈†alata football stadium, and others. These concerts often host world-famous bands and singers, such as Morrissey, Korn, Franz Ferdinand or Faithless.Faithless na ≈†alati dokazali kako i dalje nisu za mirovinu The Papaya nightclub (now called Euphoria ≈†alata) is located in the neighborhood, near the pool of ≈†RC ≈†alata. The biggest cemetery in Zagreb, Mirogoj, is located directly north of ≈†alata, reachable by Bijeniƒçka Road and Boll√© Street. It is also a heavily visited tourist destination. Mirogoj was built in 1879, shutting down eight other older city cemeteries. It is a major work of its architect, Hermann Boll√©. Boll√© is responsible for designing the magnificent arcades, which serve the role of Mirogoj western wall, while at the same time being used as graves for honored citizens of Zagreb. For his tributes to the city, Boll√© was buried in the Mirogoj arcades and the street leading to Mirogoj from Bijeniƒçka Road was named after him. Mirogoj contains sculptures of many prominent Croatian sculptors, such as Du≈°an D≈æamonja or Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. On the Mirogojska Road north of Mirogoj, the Krematorij is located. It is a smaller cemetery devoted to cremations.  Sports  ≈†RC ≈†alata swimming pool ≈†alata is known for ≈†RC ≈†alata, the Sports and Recreational Center ≈†alata. ≈†RC ≈†alata was built in the 1930s instead of expanding the existing ≈†alata hospital (KBC ≈†alata). It contains large public swimming pools, tennis courts, basketball courts, and an outdoor soccer stadium that converts to an ice rink in the winter. The center attracts both amateur and professional tennis players with its one regular size and eight smaller tennis courts. Four of these courts are covered during the winter and all are regularly lit during the evening. ≈†RC ≈†alata is the home of ≈†portsko dru≈°tvo Medve≈°ƒçak, the association of 15 sport clubs based in ≈†RC ≈†alata, most notable being ice hockey, basketball, swimming, handball, water polo and tennis clubs, all named Medve≈°ƒçak. Aside from the pools and courts, the center is equipped with a gym and a fitness club.Fitness centri :: Gladiator  Notable inhabitants  Many influential and famous people live or have lived in ≈†alata. The older part of ≈†alata, near its center and on Gr≈°koviƒáeva Road, is the wealthier part, consisting of single-family houses. Notable people who live there are Hamed Bangoura, former TV personality and the director of Midikenn fashion model recruitment agency, Savka Dabƒçeviƒá-Kuƒçar, the first woman to be a Prime Minister of Croatia during Josip Broz Tito's reign, Gojko ≈†u≈°ak, the late Croatian Minister of Defense and others. Andrija Hebrang, the president of Croatian Democratic Union parliamentary group and former Health Minister, lives in an apartment in the newly developed Baboniƒáeva Street. Alfi Kabiljo, a composer and musician, lives on Mesiƒáeva Street near the ≈†alata hospital. Gordan Jandrokoviƒá, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integrations, lives in Ru≈æiƒçnjak Street, not far from the residence of Luka Bebiƒá, the former Croatian Parliamentary Speaker. Other notable residents and former residents include Zlatko Vitez, an actor and a former Minister of Culture, Ivo Karloviƒá, a tennis player, also known as Div sa ≈†alate (≈†alata Giant), Boris Novkoviƒá, a pop singer-songwriter, Vesna Pusiƒá, the head of Croatian People's Party (HNS) and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integrations and Marin Ivanoviƒá \\"Stoka\\", a rapper. Ivica ≈†erfezi, a late pop singer, and Miroslav Miletiƒá, a classical composer, have lived in Voƒáarsko naselje, a small, but very densely inhabited part of ≈†alata located near Voƒáarska Road. Zoran Feriƒá, a writer and journalist, has lived on ≈†alata since his childhood. In 2000, two residential villas on Gr≈°koviƒáeva Street were slated to become the residences of President of Croatia and the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament. The proposal was later abandoned in favor of a location in Pantovƒçak. = Embassies = Due to its reputation as an upper-class neighborhood, ≈†alata has been a prime location for embassies for a long time. The embassy of Yugoslavia used to be located in ≈†alata until Yugoslavia was divided into Serbia and Montenegro in 2006. The neighborhood also contains the Bosnia and Herzegovina embassy, located on Torbarova Street in the southern part of ≈†alata and the Australian and Malaysian embassies. The Ukrainian embassy is located in the southeastern part on the Voƒáarska Road. The Slovenian embassy is located at the intersection of Alagoviƒáeva Street and Riesznerova Street.

It is located almost entirely in the Township municipality of Lake of Bays, which is named after the lake, with the exception of the southwest arm of the lake which is in the Town of Huntsville. Ontario Highway 35 runs north and east of the lake. Port Cunnington is a community established on a peninsula reaching out deep inside the lake. Other settlements on the lake shore include Dwight, South Portage, Baysville and Dorset. Geographic features The lake is fed by Oxtongue River, as well as other rivers and creeks flowing from the north-east (Boyne River and its tributary Sixteen Mile Creek, Ten Mile Creek, Hollow River, St. Mary Creek). Bigwin Island is the largest island in the lake; other islands include Burnt Island, Fairview Island, Langmaids Island, Pancake Island, Raynor Island, Rock Island, Haystack Island, Millichamp Island, Reuben Island, Crown Island and Peanut Island. The irregular shape of the lake is defined by many bays such as Rabbit's Bay, Burnt Island Bay, Whitehouse Bay, Montgomery Bay, Portage Bay, Haystack Bay, Ten Mile Bay, Dwight Bay,Trading Bay and Murky Bay. Origin of Name The First Nations apparently called the lake Num g e low e nee g go mark lak a hagan which means Lake of Forks. It was also known as Baptiste Lake, Forked Lake and Lake of Two Bays. In 1837, David Thompson traversed the lake and drew a map of the lake that refers to it as Forked Lake. On September 5, 1837, Thompson mentioned catching lake trout in the lake. Thomas Moffatt, an agent for the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company (Moffatt reported an outpost on Bigwin Island) referred to it as Trading Lake. In 1853, a geological survey by Alexander Murray of the Geological Survey of Canada referred to the lake as Lake of Bays.Government of Ontario, Department of Lands and Forests Map, August 1969 Amenities Due to the many bays and large size of the lake, a number of amenities have appeared around the lake including lodges, resorts, campgrounds, and golf clubs. Lake Characteristics Lake of Bays is a deep, cold, infertile lake which forms an important part of the Muskoka watershed. Despite its size and basin shape, low fertility and a short residence time combine to make it only moderately productive. Lake of Bays water is clear, and the maximum secchi disc reading obtained was . The surface layer, which is in depth, varies in temperature throughout the year. In the summer months of July and August, the surface layer can have an average temperature approaching , while the top few metres can warm to about .

Once a working part of the New York waterfront, the Pier had physically decayed by the 1980s and had developed a vibrant gay social scene for \\"cruising\\". Since renovations and the opening of the Hudson River Park's new Greenwich Village segment in 2003, it has retained its role as a gathering place for gay youth from New York City and New Jersey who have been congregating at the pier since the 1970s. However, residents of Christopher Street have complained about noisy teenagers leaving the park after its 1 a.m. curfew. Neighborhood leaders and speculators in the area's townhouse market make frequent use of the term \\"unruly\\" to describe the pier's users, many of whom are African American or Latino gay youth. Opponents of plans to displace the pier's users have sometimes accused neighborhood leaders and speculators of employing racist code to solicit support for their planned changes. Community residents created a new plan in 2005 to have the Park Enforcement Patrol escort the teens to the 14th and Hudson Street exits. According to an article in AM New York Metro, \\"A proposal by Connie Fishman ... to barricade the park‚Äôs Christopher St. exit at 1 a.m., when the Hudson River Park closes ... and thus reduce late-night noise and crowding on Christopher St.\\" The teenage users of the park responded angrily to the proposed restrictions on the Christopher Street exit and asked instead for the curfew to be moved to 4 a.m., arguing that there will be less of a crowd leaving the park at that time. A group called FIERCE (Fabulous Independent Educated Radicals for Community Empowerment) has been helping LGBT youth fight for later curfews at Christopher Street Pier; a 2001 film showcased the group's campaign to save the pier. The state's first memorial to the LGBT community was dedicated in June 2018, at the Hudson River Park near the Christopher Street Pier. The memorial, an abstract work by Anthony Goicolea, consists of nine boulders arranged in a circle. The memorial honors the victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, most of whom were gay.

Only the Roman Colosseum and the Amphitheatre of Capua are larger. It was likely built by the same architects who previously constructed the Roman Colosseum. The name \\"Flavian Amphitheater\\" is primarily associated with the Roman Colosseum. History It was begun under the reign of the emperor Vespasian and probably finished under the reign of his son Titus. The elliptical structure measures 147 x 117 meters (482 x 384 feet), with the arena floor measuring 72.22 x 42.33 meters (237 x 139 feet). The arena can hold up to 50,000 spectators. The interior is mostly intact and one can still see parts of gears, which were used to lift cages up to the arena floor. In 305, the arena was the setting for the persecutions of the patron of Pozzuoli, Saint Proculus, and the patron saint of Naples, Saint Januarius. After surviving being thrown to the wild beasts in the arena, the two were beheaded at the nearby Solfatara. The Flavian Amphitheater is the second of two Roman amphitheaters built in Pozzuoli. The smaller and older amphitheater (Anfiteatro minore) has been almost totally destroyed by the construction of the Rome to Naples railway line. Only a dozen arches of this earlier work still exist. This lesser amphitheater measured 130 x 95 meters (427 x 312 feet). The site of the structure was chosen at the nearby crossing of roads from Naples, Capua, and Cumae. It was abandoned when it was partially buried by eruptions from the Solfatara volcano. During the Middle Ages, the marble used on the exterior was stripped, but the interior was left alone and is perfectly preserved. Excavations of the site were performed 1839 to 1845, 1880 to 1882, and finally in 1947.

The interior of the Four Seasons Sultanahmet  History  Built in 1918/1919, it was the first jailhouse in the capital of the Ottoman Empire, constructed in a contemporary concept considering the regulation of the daily life and relationship with the outside of inmates, who were awaiting trial or serving brief sentences. The building was designed in Turkish neoclassical style in the beginning of the period called \\"First National Architecture\\". It was built next to the courthouse building, which was constructed in 1845 initially as university (). An inscription in Ottoman language upon the main gate of the building states the name of the facility as the \\"Capital City Murder Jail\\" (). It is a four-story building with guard towers enclosing a courtyard. In the jailhouse, juveniles and women were also detained. Following the establishment of the Saƒümalcƒ±lar Prison, the inmates were transferred to the new site and the jail was abandoned on January 25, 1969. Later during the military rule, the building continued to be used as a military jailhouse.

The Muhlenberg legend is an urban legend in the United States and Germany. According to the legend, the single vote of Frederick Muhlenberg, the first ever Speaker of the US House of Representatives, prevented German from becoming an official language of the United States. The story has a long history and has been told in several variations, which may be based in part on actual events. The United States, however, has no statutory official language; English has been used on a de facto basis because of its status as the country's predominant language. At times, various states have passed their own official language laws. History and basis of legend Franz L√∂her, whose 1847 German book included an early version of the story. There are several versions of the story. One source of the legend may be a vote in the United States House of Representatives in 1794, after a group of German immigrants asked for the translation of some laws into German.

By 1683, it had quickly become known as \\"the biggest, most beautiful and richest theatre in the city\\"The Mercure Gallant, March 1683, in Lynn, p. 102 and its operatic importance throughout the 17th and 18th centuries led to an even grander description by 1730: :A true kingdom of marvels....that with the vastness of its magnificent dimension can be rightly compared to the splendours of ancient Rome and that with the grandeur of its more than regal dramatic performances has now conquered the applause and esteem of the whole world.Lynn 2005, p. 102 Richly decorated, the theatre consisted of five levels of thirty boxes and a large stalls area. However, as an opera house, its success was short-lived and from 1751 to 1800, opera was rarely performed there. Taken over by the municipality in 1797, it became the Teatro Civico until purchased by a partnership and restored in 1819. It re-opened again, this time in private hands, with Rossini's La gazza ladra. But deterioration continued, the partnership broke up, and the remaining partner, Giovanni Gallo, continued with additional refurbishment, giving it the new name of the Teatro Emeronitto (Theatre of Day and Night)Plantamura 1996, p. 132 and inaugurating it in December 1834 with Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. When the famous soprano Maria Malibran came to sing Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula on 8 April 1835, she was clearly appalled at the condition of the theatre since Lynn reports that \\"she refused her fee, telling the impresario to 'use it for the theatre' \\" At that point the opera house became the Teatro Malibran in the singer's honour and it is the name by which the theatre has been known ever since. As the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo  Internal view of the Teatro Grimani a San Giovanni Grisostomo of 1709. Engraving by Vincenzo Maria Coronelli Built upon the place where the well-known traveller Marco Polo's residence once stood, it was designed by Thomas Bezzi for the Grimani family. It became the biggest, most luxurious and extravagant stage in Venice, known for its sumptuous productions and high quality singers such as Margherita Durastanti, prima donna between 1709 and 1712. During its golden age, composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti whose opera seria, Mitridate Eupatore, was given its premiere performance on 5 January 1707 and Georg Friedrich H√§ndel whose Agrippina premiered on 26 December 1709 were active at the theatre. Another composer's work which was presented was Carlo Francesco Pollarolo, as has been noted. During the 1730s, the San Giovanni Grisostomo began a slow and inexorable decline, although managing to keep its position at the head of Venetian theatres until the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1737, when Carlo Goldoni was placed in charge of the Venetian stage, prose works began to be performed (many of these his own comedies). Subsequently, because of its considerable size, the Grimani family decided to open a smaller theater in 1755, the San Benedetto. The opening of this new stage led to the end of the dominance of the San Giovanni, which saw a slow decrease in performance. Following the fall of the Republic of Venice and the French occupation, the theatre was among the few not to be closed. Night view of the theater As the Teatro Malibran In 1819 it was sold to Gallo, who restored it in 1834; in 1837 he changed the name to Teatro Malibran, in honor of the famous singer Spanish mezzo-soprano Maria Malibran. In 1849 the return of the Austrians to Venice provoked the closure of all the major theatres of Venice as protest, but the Malibran was the exception. Gallo's son took over in 1852; it was auctioned in 1886 then radically redecorated in the Egyptian style; it was closed for six years after a single operatic season in 1913 due to security problems, but it re-opened to present Verdi's Otello in December 1919 plus much of the popular Italian repertory after that. The Malibran was active in the presentation of operas, operettas, and even showed films for the first half of the 20th century. In 1992 the municipality of Venice purchased the theatre, and the action which they took‚Äîespecially that following the destruction of the Teatro La Fenice in January 1996‚Äîis recounted on the Commune de Venezia's website: :When the Venice City Council bought the Malibran, it marked a new phase for the theatre: the restoration of the roof was meant to be the starting point of an extremely detailed project by Antonio Foscari to completely restore the building and modify the structures, in particular to extend the gallery and boxes. When the Fenice was destroyed in a fire in January 1996, the Malibran was placed in the limelight because it had become even more indispensable. Thus, the decision was taken to respect the entire original architectural structure rather than radically change the installations and increase the set machinery so that the project would be approved more rapidly and with innovative procedures. During restoration the orchestra pit was also enlarged and an enormous underground basin was made to collect the water from Venice's occasional flooding that could have filled the entire theatre with water. :The interior decorations of the Malibran were also restored, paying particular attention to the colours sought by Donghi, previously hidden by various layers of plaster. By supporting the conservative restoration of the magnificent curtain by Giuseppe Cherubini in tempera on canvas with golden and silver yarn, the Associazione Amici della Fenice (Friends of the Fenice Association) made an important contribution to the re-opening of one of Venice's most important historical theatres that seats 900 people and is now once again an active part of the city's life.\\"The Malibran Theatre\\" on the Commune of Venice official website. The Malibran became the temporary home to the Fenice orchestra and, after a decade of work, the 900-seat Malibran was re-opened on 23 May 2001 by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, with a gala concert which included excerpts of operas by Verdi (the centennial of his death), by Bellini (the centennial of his birth) and also work by Wagner. It continues to function as an alternative venue for productions from La Fenice as well as staging many of its own: :In 1991, together with the Fenice's dance company, Carolyn Carlson presented her first performance, Undici Onde, created specifically for the Fenice. This was followed by Underwood. The ample scenic space of the Malibran has also seen performances by Pina Bausch, some of which were Italian premieres.

It was co-written by Jed Harris, the theatrical producer. The story is set in Berlin during the years following World War II. Peck plays a Military Police colonel of the United States Army. Plot Cpl. John Leatherby (Ted Avery), an American soldier stationed in West Berlin, is kidnapped after escorting his German girlfriend to her home. The Soviets deny involvement in the kidnapping through their intermediary Col. Lodejinski, who is secretly an American and British intelligence asset. Charles Leatherby, the corporal's father and a Toledo industrialist, attempts to expedite his son's retrieval by leveraging his ties to the Eisenhower administration and prominent senators. The elder Leatherby flies to West Berlin and attempts to bully State Department and military officials into quickly retrieving his son, demanding that they offer the Soviets a monetary bribe. Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Steve Van Dyke (Gregory Peck), the eccentric provost marshal for the American sector, is contacted by his old flame and East German source \\"Hoffy\\" Hoffmeir (Anita Bj√∂rk). Hoffmeir implies that Cpl. Leatherby has been kidnapped by the Soviets or East Germans, who intend to exchange him for two West Berliners, Herr and Frau Schindler. Lacking viable alternatives, Van Dyke allows Hoffmeir to facilitate the trade. After a tense meeting with Leatherby, Van Dyke invites him to dinner at the Katacombe restaurant, ostensibly to discuss the proposed exchange. Instead, Van Dyke attempts to make Leatherby understand the human cost of the trade by revealing the restaurant's piano player and her husband, who was blinded by the Nazis, as the Schindlers. While visibly disturbed by the prospect of sending the elderly couple to their deaths, Leatherby insists that the exchange proceed. Van Dyke has the couple arrested, but they attempt suicide by strychnine poisoning and are transported to an American military hospital. There, the piano player reveals herself as Rachel Cameron (Jill Esmond), an English expatriate and MI6 asset, and her husband as General Gerd von Kratzenow (Anton Farber), an anti-Nazi conspirator who had been jailed and tortured by the Nazi regime. Cameron reveals that she and her husband, now living under the name Schindler, are being pursued not by the Soviets themselves but by ex-Nazi agents responsible for von Kratzenow's torture, who now serve the Eastern Bloc. Separately, Van Dyke prepares to exfiltrate Col. Lodejinski and his family to the United States, but Lodejinski's American ties are leaked and he commits suicide after killing his entire family. Van Dyke learns from a colleague in military intelligence that his source, Hoffmeir, is an impostor Eastern Bloc asset herself. Van Dyke suspects that Hoffmeir is responsible for exposing Lodejinski as an American asset, but allows her to proceed with arrangements for the agreed-upon exchange. By claiming to Hoffmeir that von Kratzenow succumbed to the strychnine, Van Dyke sets the stage for a one-to-one trade of Cpl. Leatherby for Cameron. Van Dyke arranges for an ambulance to cross into West Berlin to effect the exchange. He is warned by State Department official Hobart (Max Showalter) that the United States government will disavow his actions if they prove unsuccessful. To facilitate the exchange without endangering American or British assets, as Cpl. Leatherby is removed from the ambulance, Van Dyke knocks Hoffmeir unconscious and presents her as Cameron. American military police force the ambulance to return to East Berlin before its escort can confirm the patient's identity. Having secured Cpl. Leatherby's return, Van Dyke is warmly congratulated by the senior Leatherby, who appears humbled by the experience. Cpl. Leatherby's repatriation is represented by the American media as a signal of warming relations with the Soviet Union. Cast * Gregory Peck as Lt. Col.

In August 1952 Thomas Chrysler was going to film it with Franchot Tone. In April 1953 Fox announced that the film would be made in CinemaScope. In July 1953, The New York Times reported that the title was changed to Night People to avoid audiences anticipating \\"an African adventure.\\" The title was taken from a property already owned by Fox, a science fiction vehicle that was to star Richard Widmark but which was never produced. =Pre-production= Nunnally Johnson had been seeking a project to break into directing, and approached Darryl F. Zanuck to direct Night People. Zanuck was amenable, but informed him that Peck had contractual rights to veto the studio's choice of director and might not want someone without experience. However, Peck and Nunnally Johnson were friends and had worked together on The Gunfighter in 1950, which Johnson had produced and re-scripted. Peck's confidence in him was so high that he readily approved him for his directorial debut. Johnson later said he\\"really didn't have much apprehension about\\" directing. \\"I'd been watching it so long and I had such good people. I knew what they should do, and I had a good cameraman, a good cutter.\\"Johnson p 333 In June 1953 the title was changed to Night People. Gloria Grahame was announced for the role of Frau Hoffmeier. Walter Abel, Anita Bjork and Broderick Crawford were then cast. Peck would go onto state that the role of Steve Van Dyke had been one of his favorites because his lines were \\"tough and crisp and full of wisecracks, and more aggressive than other roles\\" he'd portrayed. =Filming= Rumors were published in The Hollywood Reporter in September 1953 that the two had seriously feuded and that Johnson would be replaced with Henry Koster. A possible source was Peck's initial doubts about Johnson's overall abilities, but these were soon dissipated and the pair worked amicably. Darryl F. Zanuck flew out to Munich to inspect Johnson's work, but only stayed two days. He said reports of any conflict between Johnson and Peck were \\"greatly exaggerated\\". At the time this movie was made, Berlin was a divided city but not forcibly split by the Berlin Wall of 1961. Together they had also had to overcome several squabbles on the set with Fox staffers over costuming and other intrusions. One biographer reported that Peck became so angry over one dispute that he channeled his anger into a scene in which his character rebukes Broderick Crawford's, and filmed ten pages of script in two hours. Johnson and Peck teamed together again in The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. \\"Peck's a genuinely nice man\\", said Johnson. \\"He's stubborn. He's very opinionated, and sometimes I thought he was rather slow- witted. He isn't really, but he has to be convinced of the necessity of this or that before he'll do it. It can become pretty exasperating because it takes up time, but he helped me in so many ways, by making suggestions as to, say, alteration in the movement of the people. He never imposed any of his any ideas.\\" The movie's exteriors were filmed on location in Berlin, while interiors were filmed at the Geiselgasteig Studios in Munich over a five-week period in the summer of 1953, at a cost of $800,000, shot in the new wide- screen format of Cinemascope. Filming was sometimes made difficult by the tensions existing in Berlin between the United States and the Soviet Union. In one scene filmed near the Brandenburg Gate with realistic props, the film crew came under close scrutiny by numerous armed Russians suspicious of the activity. Filming was complete by October. Awards and reception Jed Harris and Tom Reed were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story. The film opened in New York on March 12, 1954, to favorable reviews, but was not well received by the public. It placed fifty-second in gross box office receipts for 1954.

Background  It is not known when Zhao Yanzhao was born, but it is known that his family was originally from Gan Prefecture (ÁîòÂ∑û, roughly modern Zhangye, Gansu). His father Zhao Wumeng (Ë∂ôÊ≠¶Â≠ü) was known for favoring hunting during youth. On one occasion, when Zhao Wumeng had killed some fresh prey and presented it to his mother (Zhao Yanzhao's grandmother), Zhao Wumeng's mother wept and stated, \\"You do not study and only hunt all day. I feel hopeless.\\" She refused the food. After that incident, Zhao Wumeng became studious and passed the imperial examination. He later served as an imperial censor during the reign of Wu Zetian and authored a 10-volume work on the notable people of the Hexi Corridor, the region he was from. Zhao Yanzhao himself was known for literary talent and being high-spirited. He passed the imperial examination as well, and was made the sheriff of Nanbu County (ÂçóÈÉ®, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan). It was around this time that he became a friend of several later prominent politicians, Guo Yuanzhen, Xue Ji, and Xiao Zhizhong. He later served as the magistrate of Xinfeng County (Êñ∞Ë±ê, in modern Shaoguan, Guangdong), before he was recalled to serve as Jiancha Yushi (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤), a mid-level imperial censor.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  In 709, during the reign of Wu Zetian's son Emperor Zhongzong, Zhao Yanzhao was promoted to be Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto.Zhao Yanzhao's biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that he was given the greater designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), but such designation was typically reserved for officials serving as chancellors whose main office was one of the third grade or above, and Zhang's main office of Zhongshu Shilang was not. His biography in the New Book of Tang indicated that he was given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi, and the Zizhi Tongjian followed this. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 92, with New Book of Tang, vol. 123 and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 209. He was also made an imperial scholar at the Xiuwen Pavilion (‰øÆÊñáÈ§®). In 710, Emperor Zhongzong was set to marry Princess Jincheng, the daughter of his nephew Li Shouli the Prince of Yong, to Tufan's king Me Agtsom. He initially ordered the chancellor Ji Chuna to escort Princess Jincheng to Tufan, but after Ji declined, ordered Zhao to do so. Zhao did not want to go‚Äîbelieving that if he left the capital Chang'an, the favors that Emperor Zhongzong had shown him might wane in his absence. At the suggestion of Zhao L√ºwen (Ë∂ôÂ±•Ê∫´), he asked Emperor Zhongzong's powerful daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle to speak on his behalf, and Emperor Zhongzong sent the general Yang Ju (Ê•äÁü©) instead.  During Emperor Shang's reign and Emperor Ruizong's second reign  Later in 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly‚Äîa death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by his powerful wife Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, so that Empress Wei could eventually be \\"emperor\\" like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could be crown princess. For the time being, Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wen, was named emperor, but Empress Wei retained power as empress dowager and regent. Zhao Yanzhao continued to serve as chancellor. Less than a month later, a coup led by Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi killed Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er. Subsequently, Li Longji's father Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, a former emperor, returned to the throne (as Emperor Ruizong), displacing Emperor Shang. Shortly after Emperor Ruizong took the throne, Zhao was demoted to be the prefect of Jiang Prefecture (Áµ≥Â∑û, part of modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), but was almost immediately recalled to again serve as Zhongshu Shilang and chancellor. Later that year, however, he was again demoted, this time to be the prefect of Songzhou. Later, for reasons unclear, he was further demoted to be the prefect of Gui Prefecture (Ê≠∏Â∑û, roughly modern Yichang, Hubei). Later, he was promoted to be the commandant at Liang Prefecture (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, roughly modern Wuwei, Gansu). He was said to be stern at Liang Prefecture, instilling much fear in his subordinates. He was subsequently recalled to serve as the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang), and later the chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu).  During Emperor Xuanzong's reign  In 712, Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji, who took the throne as Emperor Xuanzong, but Emperor Ruizong retained actual powers as Taishang Huang (retired emperor). In 713, locked in a rivalry with Princess Taiping, Emperor Xuanzong carried out a purge of her party and forced her to commit suicide, and Emperor Ruizong yielded powers to him. Two of the officials involved in Emperor Xuanzong's purge who served chancellors, Guo Yuanzhen and Zhang Shuo, were friendly with Zhao Yanzhao, and they claimed that he was part of the plot as well. Zhao was therefore made the minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Xingbu Shangshu) and created the Duke of Geng. It was around this time that Zhang, who feared that another official, Yao Yuanzhi, might be made chancellor as well, asked Zhao to submit an indictment against Yao, but Emperor Xuanzong summarily dismissed the indictment. Yao was subsequently made chancellor, and Zhang was demoted. Zhao was himself made a commanding general to the north of the capital. In 714, the imperial censor Jiang Hui (ÂßúÊô¶), pointing out that at the time of Emperor Zhongzong's death and that Empress Wei's cousin Wei Wen and fellow chancellor Zong Chuke altered Emperor Zhongzong's will to remove Emperor Ruizong as coregent, Zhao, Wei Sili, Wei Anshi, and Li Jiao were all chancellors and did nothing to stop them, had his subordinate Guo Zhen (ÈÉ≠Èúá) file an indictment against the former chancellors. Guo's indictment further accused Zhao of honoring the witch Zhao Wuniang (Ë∂ô‰∫îÂ®ò) as an aunt and secretly meeting her, while wearing women's clothing, with his wife, to ask her to use witchcraft to have him made chancellor, during Emperor Zhongzong's reign. These former chancellors were all demoted, with Zhao reduced to being the secretary general of Jiang Prefecture (Ê±üÂ∑û, roughly modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). He died while still at Jiang Prefecture, but it is not known when that occurred.  Notes  References * Old Book of Tang, vol. 92. * New Book of Tang, vol. 123. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 209, 210, 211.

History 30 Park Place under construction, as seen from One World Observatory on June 19, 2015 Larry Silverstein's Silverstein Properties, developer of the nearby World Trade Center, purchased the property at 99 Church Street for $170 million from Moody's Corporation in November 2006. At the time, the site was occupied by an 11-story, office building built in 1951 that served as Moody's headquarters. However, Moody's had recently agreed to move to Silverstein's 7 World Trade Center which would leave the Church Street building vacant in 2007. At the time, the developer and CalSTRS planned to tear down the offices and replace it with a 58-story residential tower. In March 2007, Silverstein officially unveiled plans for a 60-story, mixed-use tower on the site that would include a boutique hotel on the building's first 20 stories. The 2011 Driehaus Prize winner Robert A. M. Stern was revealed as the architect in November 2007 when Silverstein announced that the building would begin construction in mid 2008 for an early 2011 completion. Demolition of the previous 11-story building began in November 2007. The building's 80-story, tall design was showcased in January 2008 during which Four Seasons was revealed as the hotel operator along with the official address of 30 Park Place. However, by March 2009 the project was on hold as Silverstein was unable to acquire financing during the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Larry Silverstein announced a new start date of 2012 and a completion date of 2014 at the Bloomberg Real Estate Briefing in November 2010. In May 2013, Silverstein Properties secured $660 million for construction financing from UK hedge fund The Children's Investment Fund.Polsky, Sara, The World Is Finally Ready for Larry Silverstein's 30 Park Place Curbed, \\"May 15, 2013\\") Tishman Construction managed the project.

History At the time of the British Mandate the citadel in the old city of Acre was used as a prison. In total, the prison contained 700 Arab prisoners and 90 Jewish prisoners, the latter mainly members of the Jewish underground groups Haganah, Lehi, and Irgun, who had been captured by the British. One of those prisoners was Eitan Livni (father of Tzipi Livni), the Irgun operations officer. On April 19, 1947, four Irgun members, Dov Gruner, Yehiel Dresner, Mordechai Alkahi, and Eliezer Kashani, who had been captured by the British 6th Airborne Division, were hanged in Acre Prison to become the Irgun's first postwar 'martyrs'. At his trial, Dov Gruner declared the British Army and Administration to be 'criminal organizations'. The Lehi and Irgun prisoners considered an escape but concluded that would be impossible without outside assistance. They therefore contacted Irgun headquarters with a plan. Dov Cohen, AKA \\"Shimshon\\", a former member of the British Special Interrogation Group, was selected to lead the operation. The plan was facilitated by Peres Etkes, an American of Russian Jewish origins, who worked for the Mandatory authorities as an engineer and who had built the prison. According to his nephew, Etkes furnished the Irgun with a detailed map of the prison. Operation Irgun men disguised as British soldiers. The break-out was originally planned for April, but was eventually rescheduled for Sunday, May 4, 1947, at 4 p.m., the day the United Nations General Assembly convened to discuss the Palestine issue. The Irgun High Command selected 41 prisoners for escape: 30 Irgun and 11 Lehi, as that was the available number of spots available at safe houses. The Irgun High Command, and Eitan Livni, an imprisoned Irgun member, extensively planned the break and escape route.Bell, Bowyer J.: Terror out of Zion (1976) The logistic preparations were complicated: The Irgun purchased a truck, a jeep, two military pickup trucks and civilian vehicles, which were then disguised as British. British Army uniforms were also acquired. A stock of civilian clothing was also arranged to help the escapees blend in with the general population. Irgun reconnaissance efforts had discovered a weak spot in the citadel: the southern wall right above a Turkish bath. The Irgun had therefore smuggled TNT into the prison, which was then used to improvise 30 hand grenades and 2 bombs. The prison wall after the break. On Sunday, May 4, 1947, the Irgun fighters arrived at Acre in a convoy consisting of a military truck, two military vans painted in British camouflage colors, two civilian vans, and a command jeep in the lead. Twenty fighters were dressed in Royal Engineers uniforms, and three as Arabs. The operation commander, Dov Cohen, who was riding in the command jeep, was dressed as a decorated Royal Engineers captain. The truck pulled up to the prison's gate, while the two vans pulled into a nearby market. At 14:00 a military engineering unit of the Irgun, under the command of Dov Salomon and Yehuda Afiryon, went into action. Ladders were removed from one of the vehicles, and the men made their way to the nearby Turkish bath, disguised as Royal Engineers telephone technicians and carrying TNT, ropes and other necessary incursion equipment. They set the charges and climbed back down onto the street. While the Irgun units were moving into position, the prisoners were putting the plan into effect inside. At 15:00, the doors of the cells were opened for afternoon exercise. The prisoners who were not scheduled to escape went down to the courtyard to create a diversion, while the designated escapees remained in their cells. At the same time, Irgun blocking squads mined nearby roads to delay any British pursuers, and a diversion party disguised as Arabs moved into position in the vicinity of a British Army camp with a mortar. At 16:22, the charges detonated, blowing a massive hole in one of the prison's walls. Upon hearing the blast, the diversion party fired mortar shells at the British Army camp, then withdrew. Meanwhile, in the prison, the first group of escapees quickly ran out of their cells towards the breach in the wall, and had to push through a crowd of Arab prisoners that had run out of their cells in panic. Using the smuggled explosive charges, they blew up two iron gates that obstructed their way to the kerosene room, where the hole in the prison wall was. The second group of escapees put up a barricade of flammable materials and set it alight to create a fire which blocked the escape route, preventing the guards from immediately reaching it. The resulting smokescreen and fire only added to the chaos that the explosions had caused. The Arab prisoners in the prison yard began shouting and running wildly, with some running directly into the barbed-wire fences, and others rushing to or breaking out of their cells in fear of the fire and explosions. The Arab guards, assuming a prison break was underway, began shooting into the crowd. Amidst this chaos, a third group stepped into the prison yard and tossed grenades at guards positioned on the roof, causing them to flee. The explosions caused further panic and chaos among the other prisoners. Amidst the chaos, the two groups escaped through the hole in the wall. Uncertain as to what was happening, the guards did not enter the yard. Meanwhile, Arab prisoners running through the yard and corridors began to discover the hole in the wall. Over the following hour, 214 of the 394 Arab prisoners in Acre Prison escaped through the hole in the wall and disappeared into the city. The first group of escapees and some of the strike force boarded the first truck, which sped off and managed to exit Acre, but immediately south of the city they were ambushed by British soldiers who had been bathing at a nearby beach and were alerted by sounds of the commotion at Acre Prison. They opened fire on the truck. The driver, attempting to dodge the fire, drove the truck into a cactus clump, causing it to collapse on its left side. The men tumbled out and were immediately fired on by the British as they tried to escape. Dov Cohen and two other Irgun fighters, Nissim Levy and Zalman Lifshitz, was waiting by their jeep at a nearby command post. When the British opened fire, Cohen at first attempted to intervene and guide the other prisoners to safety. His uniform initially prevented the British from shooting at him, but in the end he, along with Levy and Lifshitz, were shot while providing covering fire for the escapees. A total of nine escapees and attackers died. Some had been taken alive but wounded, and died in jail after being refused medical treatment. Only one of the escapees from the first truck, Nissim Benado, managed to evade capture; but he was seriously wounded and died later in a Haifa hideout. The survivors were swiftly recaptured and returned to prison. Wanted poster for Jews who escaped The remaining escapees and members of the strike force quickly boarded the second and third trucks, and Salomon began calling the blocking squads away. Although they withdrew in good order, he forgot to call away one squad commanded by Avshalom Haviv. Meanwhile, one of the trucks experienced engine problems and would not start. As a result, the occupants had to push it while the driver tried to start the engine, and the truck was surrounded by an Arab mob, which began pelting it with objects. When the driver managed to start up the engine again, the pushers quickly climbed aboard and a sound grenade was tossed into the Arabs blocking its path, causing the crowd to disperse. The two trucks then linked up and drove away from Acre. As they passed Haviv's blocking squad, the men called to him that the operation was over, but Haviv, who felt he had to wait for a formal order from Salomon, chose to remain in place. As the trucks drove off a burst of fire hit one of them, killing one of the escapees inside. The mines planted by the blocking squads were successful in holding the British back, and five British soldiers were wounded by one mine. When the British arrived at Haviv's blocking position, the squad was captured. After the two trucks had escaped Acre, a British truck began following them shortly after they turned away from the sea road. The guard sitting in the passenger seat began firing at them with his pistol. A sound grenade was then tossed in the British truck's path. The resulting noise and burst of smoke caused the driver to brake sharply, allowing the convoy to lose the pursuing truck. The trucks reached kibbutz Dalia, where the fighters and escapees abandoned their vehicles and weapons. The head of the escapees, Eitan Livni, met with two Haganah men in the kibbutz and insisted they not contact the authorities until nine. They then walked to the town of Binyamina, and hid there for the rest of the day. The following morning, they were dispersed throughout Palestine to pre-designated hiding places. Overall, 27 Irgun and Lehi prisoners escaped, along with 214 Arab prisoners. Seven of the fighters who were killed during the operation are buried in the nearby cemetery of Shavei Tzion.http://www.ozrothagalil.org.il/atar_page.aspx?id=51 Aftermath A monument along the Acre promenade commemorating the break. The New York Herald Tribune wrote that the underground had carried out \\"an ambitious mission, their most challenging so far, in perfect fashion\\", while in the House of Commons, Oliver Stanley asked what action His Majesty's Government was planning to take \\"in light of the events at Acre prison which had reduced British prestige to a nadir.\\" The Jewish Agency called the break \\"an irresponsible suicidal act\\", while Irgun commander Menachem Begin hailed it as an act of heroism. The five men from the blocking squads who had been captured, Avshalom Haviv, Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss, Amnon Michaelov, and Nahman Zitterbaum, were tried in a British military court. Haviv, Weiss, and Nakar were sentenced to death. Michaelov and Zitterbaum escaped the death penalty due to them being minors, and received life sentences. In response to the death sentences, the Irgun abducted two British sergeants, Clifford Martin and Mervyn Paice, and threatened to kill them should the British carry out the death sentences. When the British authorities did not relent and hanged the three, the Irgun killed the two sergeants and hanged their bodies from a tree in a eucalyptus grove near Netanya. This action is credited with being one of the major catalysts for the eventual British withdrawal from Palestine.

It is considered to be a lost film. The film was adapted from the poem of the same name by Hugh Antoine d'Arcy. Plot As described in a film magazine, famous artist Robert Stevens (Walthall) is in love with Marion (Clifford). While spending a vacation along the cost of Maine, Robert paints a picture of one of the daughters of a fisherman (Saville). Some time later the body of the girl is found in the sea, and Robert is accused of being the cause of her death. Marion refuses to have anything more to do with him, and Robert drifts from bad to worse. He becomes the victim of some thieves who leave a stolen wallet on him, and he is sent to prison. During a prisoner uprising he escapes, but also saves the life of the Governor (MacGregor) who had been visiting the prison. Robert swims out to a small island and walks to the lighthouse where he finds the keeper ill and unable to keep his signal on. Robert flashes a light during a storm and thus protects the ships. He decides to return to prison, and on arrival finds a pardon awaiting him. Upon release, he returns to his old haunts and passes the Governor on the street. In a barroom, he is the subject of jests until he finally starts telling his story. He paints Marion's picture on the floor. Meanwhile, the Governor is at a dinner party and through a coincidence relates a story that makes Marion convinced that Robert has finally been found. Her brother confesses his guilt regarding the Fisherman's daughter which exonerates Robert. They go to him and bring him back, and in a while he has resumed his former life and is happy with Marion.

Career A fastball thrower, Kline started and filled various relief roles coming out from the bullpen as a closer, middle reliever, and set-up man. He entered the majors in 1930 with the Boston Red Sox, playing for them four years before joining the Philadelphia Athletics (1934) and Washington Senators (1934). While in Boston, he learned to pitch a sinker from roommate Wilcy Moore which helped him to win 11 games in 1932. On October 1, 1933, Kline was the opposing pitcher at Yankee Stadium during the last pitching appearance for Babe Ruth. At the end of the season, he was sent by Boston along Rabbit Warstler and cash to the Athletics in the same transaction that brought Lefty Grove, Rube Walberg and Max Bishop to the Red Sox. He split the season with Philadelphia and Washington, collecting seven relief wins to lead the American League pitchers.

Name The earliest written sources of Old Japanese transcribe the name of the sea god in a diverse manner. The ca. 712 CE Kojiki (tr. William George Aston 1896) writes it semantically as Êµ∑Á•û lit. \\"sea god\\", and transcribes it phonetically with man'y≈çgana as Wata-tsu-mi Á∂øÊ¥•Ë¶ã lit. \\"cotton port see\\" in identifying ≈åwatsumi kami and the Watatsumi Sanjin. The ca. 720 CE Nihongi (tr. Basil Hall Chamberlain 1919) also writes Watatsumi as Êµ∑Á•û \\"sea god\\", along with Êµ∑Á´• \\"sea child\\" and Â∞ëÁ´•ÂëΩ \\"small child lords\\" for the Watatsumi Sanjin. In the modern Japanese writing system, the name Watatsumi is usually written either in katakana as „ÉØ„Çø„ÉÑ„Éü or in kanji phonetically Á∂øÊ¥•Ë¶ã or semantically Êµ∑Á•û \\"sea god\\". Note that in addition to reading Êµ∑Á•û as watatsumi, wata no kami, or unagami in native Japanese kun'yomi pronunciation, it is also read kaijin or kaishin in Sino-Japanese on'yomi (from Chinese haishen Êµ∑Á•û \\"sea god\\"). The original Watatsumi meaning \\"tutelary deity of the sea\\" is semantically extended as a synecdoche or metaphor meaning \\"the sea; the ocean; the main\\". The etymology of the sea god Watatsumi is uncertain. Marinus Willem de Visser (1913:137) notes consensus that wata is an Old Japanese word for \\"sea; ocean\\" and tsu is a possessive particle, but disagreement whether mi means \\"snake\\" or \\"lord; god\\". \\"It is not impossible\\" he concludes, \\"that the old Japanese sea- gods were snakes or dragons.\\" Compare the Japanese rain god Kuraokami that was similarly described as a giant snake or a dragon. The comparative linguist Paul K. Benedict proposed (1990:236-7) that Japanese wata Êµ∑ \\"sea\\" derives from Proto-Austronesian *wacal \\"sea; open sea\\". ≈åwatatsumi The Kojiki version of the Japanese creation myth honorifically refers to Watatsumi Êµ∑Á•û with the name ≈åwatatsumi kami Â§ßÁ∂øÊ¥•Ë¶ãÁ•û \\"Great Watatsumi god\\". Compare this sea god with mountain god named Ohoyamatsumi Â§ßÂ±±Á©ç.

After Hoori lost his brother Hoderi's fishhook, he went searching to the bottom of the sea, where he met and married the dragon goddess Otohime. They lived in the sea god's underwater palace Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç for three years before Hoori became homesick. > So he dwelt in that land for three years. Hereupon His Augustness Fire- > Subside thought of what had gone before, and heaved one deep sigh.

Chamberlain 1919:149) Watatsumi instructs Hoori how to deal with Hoderi, and chooses another mythic Japanese dragon, a wani \\"crocodile\\" or \\"shark\\", to transport his daughter and son in law back to land. Two Nihongi contexts refer to Watatsumi in legends about Emperor Keik≈ç and Emperor Jimmu. First, the army of Emperor Keik≈ç encounters Hashirimizu È¶≥Ê∞¥ \\"running waters\\" crossing from Sagami Province to Kazusa Province. The calamity is attributed to the Watatsumi Êµ∑Á•û \\"sea god\\" and placated through human sacrifice. > Next he marched on to Sagami, whence he desired to proceed to Kadzusa. > Looking over the sea, he spake with a loud voice, and said: \\"This is but a > little sea: one might even jump over it.\\" But, when he came to the middle of > the sea a storm suddenly arose, and the Prince's ship was tossed about, so > that he could not cross over. At this time there was a concubine in the > Prince's suite, named Oto-tachibana-hime. She was the daughter of Oshiyama > no Sukune of the Hodzumi House. She addressed the Prince, saying: \\"This > present uprising of the winds and rushing of the waves, so that the Prince's > ship is like to sink, must be due to the wishes of the God of the Sea. I > pray thee let me go into the sea, and so let the person of thy mean > handmaiden be given to redeem the life of the Prince's Augustness.\\" Having > finished speaking, she plunged into the billows. The storm forthwith ceased, > and the ship was enabled to reach the shore. Therefore the people of that > time called that sea Hashiri-midzu. (tr. Aston 1896:206) Second, the genealogy of Emperor Jimmu claims descent from the goddess Toyotama-hime, the daughter of Hori and Otohime, who is identified as the daughter of Watatsumi Êµ∑Á´•. > The Emperor Kami Yamato Ihare-biko's personal name was Hiko-hoho-demi. He > was the fourth child of Hiko-nagisa-takeu-gaya-fuki-ahezu no Mikoto. His > mother's name was Tamayori-hime, daughter of the Sea-God. From his birth, > this Emperor was of clear intelligence and resolute will. (tr. Aston > 1896:109-110) There is uncertainty whether Nihongi scribes wrote tsumi with d≈ç Á´• \\"child; boy\\" simply for pronunciation or for some semantic significance. Watatsumi Sanjin When Izanagi's sister-wife dies giving birth to the fire god Kagutsuchi, his destroying it creates various deities, including the snow dragon Kuraokami. After Izanagi goes to the underworld in a futile attempt to bring Izanami back to life, he returns to the world and undergoes ritual purifications to cleanse himself of hellish filth. He creates 12 deities from his garments and belongings and 14 (including the 3 Watatsumis) from bathing himself. With the tsu Ê¥• in these three dragon names being read as the genitive particle \\"of\\", they rule different water depths in the sea, soko Â∫ï \\"bottom; underneath\\", naka ‰∏≠ \\"middle; center\\", and uwa ‰∏ä \\"above; top\\" (Kojiki) or uwa Ë°® \\"surface; top\\" (Nihongi). Chamberlain (1919:48) notes, \\"There is the usual doubt as to the signification to be assigned to the syllable tsu in the second, fourth and last of these names. If it really means, not \\"elder\\" but \\"possessor,\\" we should be obliged to translate by \\"the Bottom-Possessing- Male,\\" etc.\\" The earlier Kojiki version of the \\"Three Watatsumi Gods\\" calls them Wakatsumikami Á∂øÊ¥•Ë¶ãÁ•û \\"Wakatsumi gods\\": Sokotsu Watatsumikami Â∫ïÊ¥•, Nakatsu Watatsumikami ‰∏≠Ê¥•Á∂øÊ¥•Ë¶ãÁ•û, and Uwatsu Watatsumikami ‰∏äÊ¥•Á∂øÊ¥•Ë¶ãÁ•û. > Thereupon saying: \\"The water in the upper reach is [too] rapid; the water in > the lower reach is [too] sluggish,\\" he went down and plunged in the middle > reach; and, as he washed, there was first born the Wondrous-Deity-of-Eighty- > Evils, and next the Wondrous-Deity-of-Great-Evils.

History The Pine Sewing Machine factory was founded on 16 October 1921. In 1935, the Janome trademark was established, and the company was renamed to Janome Sewing Machine Co., Ltd. in 1954. As one of many manufacturers selling in the USA, its subsidiary is Janome America located in Mahwah, New Jersey; and also owns Swiss brand Elna. The company manufactures all of its machines in the same factories. Around 1862, William Barker and Andrew J. Clark began producing the \\"Pride of the West\\" machine, later calling it the \\"New England Single Thread Hand Sewing Machine\\" after moving the plant to Orange, Massachusetts, in 1867. Over the next few years, the New England machine and the \\"Home Shuttle\\" were their two most significant products. In 1882, the company reformed under the name New Home (a combination of the labels New England and Home Shuttle). The company ran into financial difficulties in the 1920s and was taken over by The Free Sewing Machine Company in 1930, after they temporarily ran the business for two years. In 1960, New Home and the \\"New Home\\" brand were purchased by the Janome company. Janome has led the way with innovation in sewing machines through establishing a research laboratory in Tokyo in 1964. Then in 1971 they released the first sewing machine with both programmable and computerised functions on the market. Janome was the first to develop a computerized machine for home use (the Memory 7, in 1979), the first to offer professional style embroidery to the home market (the Memory Craft 8000, in 1990) and the first to offer a long-arm quilting machine for home use (the Memory Craft 6500P, in 2003). Name The name \\"Janome\\" (Ëõá„ÅÆÁõÆ) literally means \\"snake's eye\\" and was taken from the appearance of the current bobbin design at the time of brand establishment in 1935 when the round bobbin system was the more advanced technology replacing the traditional long shuttle type. As the new round bobbin looked like a snake's eye, Janome was chosen as the company's name. Janome is also the name of the traditional Japanese bull's-eye umbrella design. Retail sales network Janome sewing machine Janome is a globally recognized brand and has expanded into over 100 countries around the world. Distribution occurs through a retail sales channel, and information about where to purchase can be found through their global website.

Philadelphia: King & Baird. 1851. mysterious smoke was reported south of Wheeling in the McMechen area. Wheeling residents were concerned that Indians had attacked and burned the stockade and houses of Mr. Tomlinson. Colonel David Shepherd dispatched Captain Foreman and 45 men to investigate the source of the smoke to the south.History of the Upper Ohio Valley. Madison, WI: Brant & Fuller, 1890. p 71. Captain Foreman discovered the settlements at McMechen to be intact with no evidence of Indian attacks. After staying the night at McMechen, the party returned north on the morning of Sunday, September 26. Frontier guides familiar with the area suggested to Captain Foreman that he and his party should leave the path at the river bottom and return to Wheeling by way of the ridge. A man named Lynn explained to the commander that Indians in the area had probably noted the party's movements and crossed the river during the night. They would most likely attack the group at the river. Foreman refused this advice and ordered his men to stay on the lower route. Lynn and a group of six or eight others ignored Foreman's orders and followed the ridge path. When the party reached the extreme upper end of the McMechen Narrows, the men under Foreman's command broke ranks to investigate a display of Indian trinkets strewn across the path. As the entire party gathered around the trinkets, two lines of Indians from both sides of the path opened fire in a coordinated ambush. The men of Foreman's party who escaped the initial volley were pursued as they tried to escape up the hill to the ridge. The Indian force, numbering 20 to 25 men, suffered no known casualties. Lynn and his party, upon hearing the guns, rushed down the hill toward the site of the ambush \\"hallooing as if they were five times as numerous\\" (De Haas). Their efforts caused the Indians to retreat, but not before killing Captain Foreman and 21 of his men, including two of Foreman's sons. The account of men killed in the ambush included: Captain William Foreman, Edward Peterson, Benjamin Powell, Hambleton Foreman, James Greene, John Wilson, Jacob Pew, Isaac Harris, Robert McGrew, Elisha Shriver, Henry Risera, Batholomew Viney, Anthony Miller, John Vincent, Solomon Jones, William Ingle, Nathan Foreman, and Abraham Powell.Powell, Scott.

Division 2, section 4 Accessed 11 February 2009 A key feature of the Act is its creation of a new legal responsibility or statutory \\"duty of care\\" requiring all people across the State to respect, value and protect the State's Aboriginal cultural heritage, at risk of prosecution and substantial fines should they fail to take all reasonable and practical measures to ensure their activities do no damage Background and history The excavation of the Broadbeach Aboriginal burial ground in 1965, and the repatriation and reburial of the remains in 1988 played a significant role in the development of this Act, which was the state's first cultural heritage legislation, which culminated in this piece of legislation. The Aboriginal Relics Preservation Act 1967 was the first piece of legislation to protect Aboriginal archaeological sites. This was replaced by the Cultural Record (Landscapes Queensland and Queensland Estate) Act 1987, which was in turn replaced by the 2003 Act.  Overview  In proclaiming this statute, Queensland Parliament: * created a statutory duty of care applying to all land users in Queensland, regardless of tenure; * recognized any pre- existing agreements landholders may have entered into with Aboriginal owners; * established a register of Aboriginal cultural heritage to be protected, plus database holding information and details of known Aboriginal cultural heritage places * proscribed fundamental principles requiring areas and objects of significance to Aboriginal people to be protected and managed in accordance with relevant Aboriginal laws, customs or history * provided for Aboriginal peoples to play an active role protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage by enabling particularly interested groups to form State approved Aboriginal cultural heritage bodies to whom cultural heritage inquires are referred * provided for land users and Aboriginal peoples to be able to negotiate, agree, enter into, and, if desired, register with the State, cultural heritage management plans proscribing how Aboriginal cultural heritage is to be managed in particular places * removed an earlier requirement under former Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation that a permit first be obtained before cultural heritage studies or management plans could be undertaken.  Definition of Cultural Heritage  The Act defines Aboriginal cultural heritage as being:Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines (2006) Queensland Laws protect and respect our cultural heritage. Brochure, Brisbane * any significant Aboriginal area within Queensland; * any significant Aboriginal object from Queensland; or * any place within Queensland containing in situ evidence of archaeological or historic significance to Aboriginal peoples prior occupation of the State A Minister who was responsible for implementing the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003 (i.e. then Queensland Natural Resources and Water Minister Craig Wallace) gave example of the kinds of things he believes to be Aboriginal cultural heritage as follows: > \\"Cultural Heritage relates to significant Aboriginal .. objects and places, > or archaeological or historic evidence of indigenous occupation of an area > ...These can be rock shelters, carved or scarred trees, engravings, > paintings, shell middens, fish traps, grinding grooves, earth and stone > arrangements and other artifacts.\\"  Statutory \\"Duty of Care\\"  In proclaiming the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003, Queensland Parliament intended to provide \\"blanket\\" statutory protection to ALL of Queensland's Aboriginal cultural heritage, irrespective of whether or not that heritage is known toland users. To achieve this end, Parliament created a formal, statutory \\"duty of care\\", by which anyone carrying out any activity on any land (including freehold) anywhere in Queensland is required by law to take:Department of Natural Resources and Mines (2005) \\"Cultural Heritage - Your Duty of Care\\".

It produced cars for Sears Roebuck from 1908 until 1912. Nine models were offered, priced between US$325 and $475, with the Model L advertised at $495 complete. They were sold by mail, out of the Sears catalog. Sears had a very lenient return policy: cars were sold on a ten-day trial basis. The cars had an air-cooled, two-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine, similar to that later used on BMW motorcycles. The engine was located under the floorboards, beneath the driver‚Äôs feet, and started from a hand crank in the front. Early cars were rated at 10 hp, and later models developed 14 hp. At least one of the engines used was a Reeves Model P. In the interest of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus driving the sprocket shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the \\"gear ratio\\" for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller to move away from the flywheel. The \\"clutch pedal\\" worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator‚Äôs foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing \\"neutral\\" so the car could be cranked without moving forwards. The engine was lubricated by an \\"oiler\\", essentially a tank mounted under the seat which had several adjustable drip feeds with separate lines to the engine bearings and other areas. All components of the transmission were exposed, so several bearings and pivots had to be oiled or greased manually from time to time. A form of differential action was obtained by building each front drive sprocket with a two-way clutch. These clutches engaged when the shaft upon which they were mounted turned in either direction, but disengaged when the wheel turned them faster than the shaft. When driven in a straight line, both clutches would engage, and provide power to both rear wheels. When the car went around a corner, the outside wheel turned slightly faster than the inside wheel, disengaging the sprocket for the outside wheel, and propelling the car with the inside wheel only. On slippery roads, such as in deep mud, snow, or sand, if one wheel lost traction the other wheel would continue to pull, allowing the car the continue moving until either both wheels found traction once more, or both wheels lost traction completely. Because the cars were very light weight, they were capable of being driven through mud or snow which would immobilize heavier cars with conventional differentials. Although not a bad car for its type, the design of the cars was more representative of cars from the period 1900-1905, and even some experimental models from the 1890s. Motor buggys were already becoming somewhat unfashionable during the period when they were sold by Sears (1908‚Äì1912). By that time, the market had mostly moved toward cars with more powerful engines and the ability to be driven comfortably at a higher speed. The catalog claimed a top speed of 25 mph for the Motor Buggy, which would have meant a comfortable cruising speed of 15 mph or so. Many competing cars of the period, such as the early Ford Model T, Buick, Maxwell, Franklin, and others were capable of top speeds of 45 mph or more, with cruising speeds equal to or greater than the 25 mph top speed of the Motor Buggy. Because of the obsolete styling (for the period of its manufacture), a Sears Motor Buggy was chosen to portray the home-built experimental car constructed by automobile inventor Joe Belden (Red Skelton) in the 1951 film, \\"Excuse My Dust\\". The film was set in the 1890s, and features several other early cars, including a Curved-Dash Oldsmobile. In the film, the Sears shows itself to be capable of running well on smooth roads, through deep water, and through pumpkin patches. The company is not related to the current Lincoln Motor Company luxury car brand owned by Ford Motor Company, which was founded by Henry M. Leland in 1917, two years after Sears stopped selling cars.  Footnotes  References * Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925. New York: Bonanza, 1950. Page 90.

Background The Company is a manufacturer of zero emission electric cars and vans designed by the father and son team of Tony Stevens and Peter Stevens.The Daily Telegraph, Motoring section, 1 March 2008 The vehicles were conceived, designed and developed in Kent, England and are manufactured at Port Talbot, Wales. The brand, comprising two vehicle types, was launched on 1 March 2008, comprising the ZeCar and ZeVan. The designer is Professor Tony Stevens, who has spent over 50 years in the motor industry and who has long experience in the engineering, design and marketing of vehicles. Tony Stevens designed the Hillman Hunter and Sunbeam Rapier. Peter Stevens is an international banker, involved in the financial and sales side of the business. The design of the vehicles has been described as being \\"deliciously weird....a bit dippy, yet great fun and strangely stylish.\\" The strong visual statement derives from their distinctive height, which results from the higher than normal driving position. This is based on the belief, of Tony Stevens, that the driver should be positioned as if sitting at a table. This position gives the driver good access and visibility, but the design also provides plenty of headroom. Both types of vehicle are designed to maximise internal space relative to external dimensions so that, although they are shorter and narrower than most compact vehicles they are also taller, thus creating the equivalent space of a much larger vehicle. The Ze in Zecar and ZeVan stands for zero environmental emissions. On-road carbon dioxide emissions are zero. However, the lead-acid batteries require recharging which may produce carbon dioxide, depending on the energy supply source. Stevens Vehicles is being supported by the Welsh Assembly Government's Accelerate Clusters programme which plans to strengthen the automobile sector in Wales by developing emerging technologies and identifying and exploiting niche markets. The factory is based at the ECM2 business site within the Port Talbot Steelworks. The Stevens Vehicles website currently indicates that they are no longer producing vehicles having failed to secure further adequate finance. ZeCar The ZeCar is a 5-door hatchback with a twin AC induction brushless and maintenance free electric engine, giving the car 140 lb ft of torque. There is a maintenance-free toothed belt drive to the rear wheels. Battery charging comprises an on-board automatic charging system, with maintenance-free sealed lead-acid gel batteries. The maximum speed of the ZeCar is 56 mph, and with standard batteries the maximum range is 56 miles, unless back-up battery solutions are used. Acceleration is 0‚Äì40 mph in 15 seconds. The running cost is calculated at 1.2p per mile and the car is not subject to road tax, or congestion charges and parking is free or discounted in some cities such as London. In 2008, this was the only five-seat electric car on sale in Britain. ZeVan The ZeVan is based on the same design as the ZeCar. Access to the rear is by twin-split doors which open out fully and the near-cube design allows optimum space utilisation. The load volume is one Cheps pallet or a Euro pallet and the payload is 450 kg. The dimensions of the load area are 1.80 cubic metres. The estimated battery life is 700 cycles at 80% depth of discharge and the design life is 12 years. The cost per mile is estimated at between 1p and 1.2p depending on the electricity tariff rate. As the van is electric it does not need servicing and at the end of the battery life Stevens Vehicles would plan to collect the old battery, replace it with a new one, and recycle the old battery. The van is constructed on the principle that it can be recharged on a three-pin plug, thus avoiding the need for supporting infrastructure, although rapid chargers can be purchased allowing a recharge time of 30 minutes. The range is 55 miles for the van and driver, reducing to 38 miles for a fully laden van. Additional batteries can be fitted to increase the range by 50%, but with a corresponding reduction in payload of 125 kg. Plans The project plan is to develop several variations on the \\"Ze\\" theme. Plans include variants on the Ze range, including a pick-up truck and taxi, together with a contemporary version of the Cipher, a concept car first shown at the 1980 motor show and which could go on sale with an electric engine with a range capability of 70 miles and a 70 mph top speed. New battery technologies are under development, including non-hydrogen fuel cells and bio- diesel hybrids. The global plan is to establish small Ze plants in rural areas across the developing world. The production line and other tools and materials would be delivered by a single lorry and full-scale production could begin rapidly with output flexible enough to meet the cycle of local supply. Tony Stevens refers to this concept as Global Village Transport.

Poƒçitelj was considered the administrative center and center of governance of ≈Ωupa Dubrava (county), while its westernmost point gave it major strategic importance. During the years following Ottoman conquest of Bosnian realm, between 1464 and 1471, the town was fortified by Vladislav Herzegoviƒá with a support of Dubrovnik, king Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and the Pope. From this point the walled town of Poƒçitelj evolved in the period from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Architecturally, the stone- constructed parts of the town are a fortified complex, in which two stages of evolution are evident: medieval, and Ottoman.The historic urban site of Poƒçitelj In the period between 1463‚Äì1471 the town housed a Hungarian garrison and was fortified into a strategic defence stronghold. In 1471, following a brief siege, the town was conquered by the Ottomans. It lost its strategic significance. It remained within the Ottoman Empire until 1878. From 1782 to 1879 Poƒçitelj was the seat of akadiluk (area under the jurisdiction of a qadi, or judge) and the center of the Poƒçitelj military district from 1713 to 1835. The significance and the town's appearance has altered during the course of its history. As far as the development of Poƒçitelj goes, three significant periods can be distinguished: # The period of the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus during which the town had a major strategic importance (1463‚Äì1471) # The period of the settlement development under the Ottoman Empire with the erection of public buildings: mosques, imaret, maktab, madrasa, hamam, han and the clock-tower (1471‚Äì1698). # The period after the Venetians conquered and destroyed Gabela (1698‚Äì1878), the main Ottoman fortification facing Dalmatia, and recovery of Poƒçitelj's strategic importance. After the establishment of Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, Poƒçitelj lost its strategic importance and started deteriorating rapidly. The population declined gradually. The loss of the town's strategic role assisted in the preservation of the original urban architectural ensemble, so that the town remained in its original form to present day. The entire historic urban site of Poƒçitelj and surrounding area suffered extensive collateral damage during the 1992‚Äì1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Namely, it was heavily damaged by Croatian forces during the 1993 Bosnian War. Following the bombing, Poƒçitelj's sixteenth-century master works of Islamic art and architecture were destroyed and a large part of the town's population was displaced. As proposed by the University of York, United Kingdom, and the University of Sarajevo, Poƒçitelj was in 1996 named by the World Monuments Watch as one of the world's 100 most endangered cultural heritage sites. In the year 2000 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government initiated the Programme of the permanent protection of Poƒçitelj. The programme includes the protection of cultural heritage from deterioration, restoration of damaged and destroyed buildings, encouraging the return of the refugees and displaced persons to their homes and the long-term protection and revitalization of the Poƒçitelj's historic urban area. The Programme is on-going. As of 2008, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) expressed concern over the proposed construction of a nearby highway, Corridor Vc. Initial plans include a 1,000-meter long, 100-meter high bridge over the Neretva river. It is feared that the construction will result in a ‚Äúphysical, visual and ecological degradation and devastation of this cultural and historical unity and its authentic surroundings.‚ÄùICOMOS Bosnia- Herzegovina (2008). \\"Appeal to Save Poƒçitelj\\". In Christoph Machat, Michael Petzet and John Ziesemer (Eds.), . Berlin: hendrik B√§√üler verlag, 2010, pg. 36. While a new potential location for the bridge crossing is being investigated, non-controversial sections are under construction. Historic sites * The Gavrankapetanoviƒá house: built at the end of the 16th century, it was named after and housed the captains of Poƒçitelj, who belonged to the Gavrankapetanoviƒá family. It is typical example of the residential architecture of the village. It is the only house in town to have separate rooms for men and women. The house became the residence of an artists' colony between 1961 and 1975, one of which was the Italian painter Vittorio Miele. This was the longest operating artist colony in Southeast Europe. During the Bosnian war, the house was set on fire. It was restored in its original state in 2003. * The ≈†i≈°man Ibrahim-pa≈°ina d≈æamija or Hajji Alija mosque: built in 1563 by Hajji-Alija, son of Musa. It was repaired in the 17th century by ≈†i≈°man Ibrahim Pasha. The locals gave the mosque afterwards his name. The domed mosque is notable for its special acoustics. The mosque was restored in the 1970s, but badly damaged during the Bosnian War in 1993. It was restored again in 2002. * The Kula, a silo-shaped fort overlooking the village from the top of the hill. It used to house watchmen and military as a guard against possible intrusions from the Neretva valley. * The Sahat Kula, a bell tower located closer to the river and at the south side of the old town.  Demographics  No up-to-date data currently exists for Poƒçitelj and its demographic profile was significantly altered after the Bosnian war. The last demographics research was conducted in 1991 and its results were as follows: Population Total: 905Official results from the book: Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991. * Bosniaks - 660 (72.92%) * Croats - 172 (19.00%) * Yugoslavs - 36 (3.97%) * Serbs - 20 (2.20%) * others and unknown - 17 (1.87%)  Significance  Poƒçitelj represents one of the few urban ensembles in Bosnia and Herzegovina that were preserved in their integrity to the present times. It was also developed through the several phases of the history beginning with the medieval period. Its significant strategic role from the 13th to 17th century gave its inhabitants the power to build one of the most important, and best preserved ensembles within the city walls in the region. The town can be compared with some of the noted world heritage sites as the old towns of Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Ohrid (North Macedonia), Safranbolu (Turkey), Gjirokaster (Albania). Poƒçitelj's layout and use of building materials put it into the group of Ottoman-Mediterranean types of small settlements.

Its hospital affiliate was to be Hackensack University Medical Center (HUMC). The medical school disbanded in December 2009. The school was established on April 16, 2007, with Paul M. Wallach, M.D. named as its founding dean. The first proposed location of the school was on the campus of the former Pascack Valley Hospital (PVH) in Westwood, New Jersey, which had closed after declaring bankruptcy in November 2007. HUMC had acquired the PVH property on February 27, 2008, in an auction for $45 million in a joint bid with Touro. right For the school to have become accredited and begin to admit students, it needed to undergo a site visit by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). This was scheduled a year in advance for a visit in March 2008, but HUMC and Touro did not close on the newly purchased Pascack Valley Hospital property until April 30, 2008. As the LCME requires that potential medical schools own their property, the school could not have been accredited at that time. In September 2008, Touro backed out of their deal with HUMC, proposing instead to open their medical school in Hasbrouck Heights, while HUMC independently opened a satellite emergency department on the Westwood campus, called Hackensack University Medical Center North at Pascack Valley on October 1, 2008.

Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274 (1908), also referred to as the Danbury Hatters' Case, is a United States Supreme Court case in US labor law concerning the application of antitrust laws to labor unions.. The Court's decision effectively outlawed the secondary boycott as a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, despite union arguments that their actions affected only intrastate commerce.Carter, Saalim A. Labor Unions and Antitrust Legislation: Judicial Activism vs. Judicial Restraint from 1890-1941. Penn State University, 2006. p. 28. It was also decided that individual unionists could be held personally liable for damages incurred by the activities of their union.Carter, p. 30. Facts In 1901, D. E. Loewe & Company, a fur hat manufacturer, declared itself an open shop.Federal Writers' Project (1938). Connecticut: A Guide to Its Roads, Lore and People. Reprint: US History Publishers. . pp. 132-133. It was the third open shop ever established in Danbury, Connecticut, the center of the pelt industry since 1780 (see North American fur trade). Loewe's declaration sparked a strike and a boycott by the United Hatters of North America (UHU), which had organized 70 out of 82 firms in the hat manufacturing industry. The nationwide boycott was assisted by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and was successful in persuading retailers, wholesalers and customers not to buy from or do business with Loewe. The goal of the operation was for UHU to gain union recognition as the bargaining agent for employees at Loewe & Co. Loewe & Co. sued the union for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, alleging that UHU's boycott interfered with Loewe's ability to engage in the interstate commerce of selling hats. The act had been adopted in 1890, with the primary purpose to control business monopolies.Holley, p. 106. The appellee in the case was Martin Lawlor, the business agent for the UHU, but the list of defendants included 240 union members.Danbury Museum & Historical Society, Danbury. Arcadia Publishing, 2001. p. 79. The case was handled in the first instance by the United States Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut, which dismissed the suit on the grounds that the alleged actions fell outside the scope of the Sherman Act. Loewe & Co. appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which certified the case to the Supreme Court. Judgment In a unanimous decision written by Chief Justice Melville Fuller, the UHU was found to have been acting in restraint of interstate commerce and to have violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. Fuller began the opinion by recounting the relevant provisions of the Sherman Act. The first, second, and seventh section of the act can be concisely described as follows: :1. Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is illegal. :2. Every person who monopolizes, or attempts to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is in violation of the statute. :3. Any person who is injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation by reason of anything forbidden or declared illegal by the act may sue in federal court in the district of the defendant and recover three fold damages. Fuller concluded that the actions of the union did constitute unlawful combination of the type described in the act: \\"In our opinion, the combination described in the declaration is a combination 'in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States,' in the sense in which those words are used in the act, and the action can be maintained accordingly.\\" The union had raised a number of objections to the application of the act to its activities, all of which were found to be untenable by the Court. While the union had not interfered with the transportation of hats originating with Loewe & Co., a national boycott conceived on the initiative of the union that comprised vendees in other states was a violation of interstate commerce as proscribed by the statute: > If the purposes of the combination were, as alleged, to prevent any > interstate transportation at all, the fact that the means operated at one > end before physical transportation commenced, and at the other end after the > physical transportation ended, was immaterial. And that conclusion rests on > many judgments of this court, to the effect that the act prohibits any > combination whatever to secure action which essentially obstructs the free > flow of commerce between the States, or restricts, in that regard, the > liberty of a trader to engage in business. The fact that the union was not itself engaged in interstate commerce was irrelevant since the act did not distinguish between the types of associations involved but simply forbade every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade. Fuller underscored that no exemption had been made for organizations of laborers or farmers, despite lobbying to include such language in the statute: > The records of Congress show that several efforts were made to exempt, by > legislation, organizations of farmers and laborers from the operation of the > act, and that all these efforts failed, so that the act remained as we have > it before us. Consequently, while the boycott and strike action had originated in a single state, the combination efforts had to be viewed in aggregation: > (...) [T]he acts must be considered as a whole, and the plan is open to > condemnation notwithstanding a negligible amount of intrastate business > might be affected in carrying it out. The judgment of dismissal was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. Significance Verdict for the plaintiffs in the Loewe v. Lawlor case In 1909, a new trial was held in the District Court to determine the outcome of the case. The presiding judge directed the jury to find for Loewe & Co., in accordance with the Supreme Court decision. The jury returned with a verdict of $74,000 in damages, which was tripled, under the Sherman Act, to $222,000.Ernst, Daniel R. Lawyers against labor: from individual rights to corporate liberalism. University of Illinois Press, 1995. p. 151. The union won on appeal but then lost on retrial in 1912.Tomlins, Christopher. The United States Supreme Court: The Pursuit of Justice. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2005. p. 162. The case reached the Supreme Court in 1914, and in Lawlor v. Loewe (1915), the Court again held the union liable for damages. In 1917, the case was settled for slightly over $234,000 (approximately $3.9 million in 2009 currency) of which the AFL was able to obtain $216,000 in voluntary contributions from union members.Gould, William B. A Primer on American Labor Law. MIT Press, 2004. p. 14. The ruling deprived labor unions of an important and effective union tactic, and the decision to hold individual union members personally liable for damages had an adverse impact on union organizing efforts.William H. Holley and Kenneth M. Jennings. The Labor Relations Process. South-Western, Division of Thomson Learning, 2008. p. 78. That led the AFL to initiate an aggressive campaign to convince Congress to address labor concerns about the Sherman Act in the reform of antitrust laws. The push culminated with the passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which provided that \\"the labor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce.\\" Section 20 of the act further stated that no injunctions should be granted by federal courts in labor disputes \\"unless necessary to prevent irreparable injury to property, or to a property right.\\" The provisions, however, were narrowly interpreted by the Supreme Court, which ruled, in Duplex Printing Press Company v. Deering (1921), that the exemptions in the Clayton Act did not protect secondary boycotts from judicial control. Prosecution of labor under antitrust laws would continue until the enactment of the Norris‚ÄìLa Guardia Act in 1932, which included express exemptions of organized labor from antitrust injunctions. The exemptions were upheld by the Supreme Court in United States v. Hutcheson (1941), which stated that the act should be read broadly to provide a total antitrust exemption for labor unions, \\"so long as [the] union acts in its self-interest and does not combine with non-labor groups.\\" The majority opinion in Hutcheson was written by Felix Frankfurter, who, before becoming a Supreme Court Justice, had served as one of the drafters of the Norris-La Guardia Act.Dubofsky, Melvyn.

While men from all ethnic groups committed rape, the vast majority of rapes were perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces of the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) and Serb paramilitary units, who used rape as an instrument of terror and key tactics as part of their programme of ethnic cleansing. Estimates of the number of women raped during the war range between 10,000 and 50,000, with the further estimate that for one reported rape there are 15 to 20 unreported cases. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) declared that \\"systematic rape\\" and \\"sexual enslavement\\" in time of war was a crime against humanity, second only to the war crime of genocide. Although the ICTY did not treat the mass rapes as genocide, many have concluded from the organized, and systematic nature of the mass rapes of the female Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) population, that these rapes were a part of a larger campaign of genocide, and that the VRS were carrying out a policy of genocidal rape against the Bosnian Muslim ethnic group. The trial of VRS member Dragoljub Kunarac was the first time in any national or international jurisprudence that a person was convicted of using rape as a weapon of war. The widespread media coverage of the atrocities by Serbian paramilitary and military forces against Bosniak women and children, drew international condemnation of the Serbian forces. Following the war, several award-winning documentaries, feature films and plays were produced which cover the rapes and their aftermath.  Background  Foƒça were executed whilst women were detained and repeatedly raped by members of the Bosnian Serb armed forces. Grbavica in 1996, a site of rape camps during the Bosnian War and subject of the award-winning film Grbavica. According to Amnesty International, the use of rape during times of war is not a by-product of conflicts, but a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. The first aim of these mass rapes is to instill terror in the civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second aim is to reduce the likelihood of return and reconstitution by inflicting humiliation and shame on the targeted population. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. The use of mass rape is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return. Historians such as Niall Ferguson have assessed a key factor behind the high-level decision to use mass rape for ethnic cleansing as being misguided nationalism. Since its inception, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had not been a platform for internal nationalist sentiment, and individuals who sought to ignite tensions risked imprisonment, torture or execution. In 1989, Serbian president, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá inflamed Serbian nationalist sentiment with the Gazimestan Speech which referred to the Battle of Kosovo. Feelings of victimhood and aggression towards Bosniaks were further stirred up with exaggerated tales about the role played by a small number of Bosniaks in the persecution of Serbs during the Usta≈°e genocide in the 1940s. Serb propaganda suggested that Bosniaks were largely descended from Turks. Despite the Serbian government-led hate campaigns, some Serbs tried to defend Bosniaks from the atrocities and had to be threatened, including instances when troops would announce by loudspeaker that \\"every Serb who protects a Muslim will be killed immediately\\". Before the conflict began, Bosniaks in Eastern Bosnia had already begun to be removed from their employment, to be ostracised and to have their freedom of movement curtailed. At the outset of the war, Serb forces began to target the Bosniak civilian population. Once towns and villages were secured, the military, the police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers continued these attacks. Bosniak houses and apartments were looted or razed to the ground, the civilian population were rounded up, some were physically abused or murdered during the process. Men and women were separated and then held in concentration camps. Occurrence of rape  Estimates of the number of women and girls raped range from 12,000 to 50,000, the vast majority of whom were Bosniaks raped by Bosnian Serbs. UNHCR experts have claimed 12,000 rapes. The European Union estimates a total of 20,000, while the Bosnian Interior Ministry claims 50,000. The UN Commission of Experts identified 1,600 cases of sexual violence. Serb forces set up \\"rape camps\\", where women were subjected to being repeatedly raped, and only released when pregnant. Gang rape and public rapes in front of villagers and neighbors were not uncommon. On 6 October 1992, the United Nations Security Council established a Commission of Experts chaired by M. Cherif Bassiouni. According to the commission's findings, it was apparent that rape was being used by Serb forces systematically, and had the support of commanders and local authorities. The commission also reported that some perpetrators said they were ordered to rape. Others said that the use of rape was a tactic to make sure the targeted population would not return to the area. The assailants told their victims they would bear a child of the assailant's ethnicity.\\"War rape in the former Yugoslavia\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, 10 December 1992 Pregnant women were detained until it was too late to have the fetus aborted. Victims were told they would be hunted down and killed should they report what had transpired. The commission also concluded that: \\"Rape has been reported to have been committed by all sides to the conflict. However, the largest number of reported victims have been Bosniaks, and the largest number of alleged perpetrators have been Bosnian Serbs. There are few reports of rape and sexual assault between members of the same ethnic group.\\" The team of European Community investigators, including Simone Veil and Anne Warburton, similarly concluded in their 1993 report that rape carried out by the Bosnian Serb forces was not a secondary effect of the conflict but part of a systematic policy of ethnic cleansing and was \\"perpetrated with the conscious intention of demoralizing and terrorizing communities, driving them from their home regions and demonstrating the power of the invading forces\\". Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch also concluded during the conflict that rape was being used as a weapon of war, with the primary purpose being to cause humiliation, degradation, and intimidation to ensure the survivors would leave and never return. Throughout the conflict, women of all ethnic groups were affected, although not on the scale that the Bosniak population suffered. Testimony from a Klainovik camp survivor (where roughly 100 women had been detained and subjected to \\"multiple perpetrator rape\\") said that the rapists continually told their victims, \\"You are going to have our children. You are going to have our little Chetniks\\", and that the reason for their being raped was to \\"plant the seed of Serbs in Bosnia\\". Women were forced to go full term with their pregnancies and give birth. Many of the reports of the abuses illustrated the ethnic dimension of the rapes. =Locations and procedures= \\"Karaman's House\\", a location where women were tortured and raped near Foƒça, Bosnia and Herzegovina. (Photograph provided courtesy of the ICTY) Serb forces set up camps where rapes occurred, such as those at Keraterm, Vilina Vlas, Manjaƒça, Omarska, Trnopolje, Uzamnica and Vojno. In May 1992, Serb villagers from Snagovo, Zvornik, surrounded and captured the village of Liplje and turned it into a concentration camp. Four hundred people were imprisoned in a few houses and those held there were subject to rape, torture and murder. Over a five-month period between the spring and summer of 1992, between 5,000 and 7,000 Bosniaks and Croats were held in inhumane conditions at Omarska. At the concentration camp, rape, sexual assaults and torture of men and women were commonplace. One newspaper described the events there as \\"the location of an orgy of killing, mutilation, beating and rape\\". Rape murder and physical abuse were commonplace. At the Trnopolje camp an unknown number of women and girls were raped by Bosnian Serb soldiers, police officers and the camp guards. At the Uzamnica camp, one witness in the trial of Oliver Krsmanoviƒá, charged with crimes relating to the Vi≈°egrad massacres, claimed that the male detainees were at one time forced to rape women. Detention camps were set up across the Serb-controlled town of Foƒça. While kept at one of the town's most notable rape locations, \\"Karaman's house\\", Bosniak females, including minors as young as 12, were repeatedly raped. During the trial of Dragoljub Kunarac et al., the conditions of these camps were described as being \\"intolerably unhygienic\\", and the head of the police in Foƒça, Dragan Gagoviƒá, was identified as being one of the men who would visit these camps, where he would select women, take them outside, and then rape them. Women and girls selected by Kunarac, or by his men, were taken to the soldiers' base and raped. At other times, girls were removed from detention centers and kept in various locations for prolonged periods of time under sexual slavery. Radomir Kovaƒç, who was also convicted by the ICTY, personally kept four girls in his apartment, abusing and raping three of them many times, while also allowing acquaintances to rape one of the girls. Prior to selling three of the girls, Kovaƒç appointed two of them to other Serb soldiers who abused them for more than three weeks. Croat forces set up concentration camps at ƒåelebiƒái, Dretelj, Gabela, Rodoƒç, Kaonik, Vitez, and ≈Ωepa. At the joint Bosniak-Croat run ƒåelebiƒái facility, Serb civilians were subjected to various forms of torture and sexual abuse, including rape. At Dretelj the majority of prisoners were Serbian civilians, who were held in inhumane conditions, while female detainees were raped and told that they would be held until they gave birth to an \\"Usta≈°a\\". Both Serbian and Bosniak civilians were held at the Heliodrom camp in Rodoc, and detainees were reported to have been sexually assaulted. Serbian women and girls were raped and tortured in Bosniak-run brothels in Sarajevo. In Doboj, Bosnian Serb forces separated the females from the men and then facilitated the rape of some women by their own male family members. Women were questioned about male relatives in the city, and one woman's fourteen-year-old son was forced to rape her. = Men and boys = A lesser known form of rape during the war was that which was perpetrated against men and boys. Though no concrete number has been determined, it has been estimated that some 3,000 were raped during the conflict. However, it is assumed that hundreds, if not thousands, of victims have never come forward due to their deaths as well as the stigma regarding sexual abuse. Many male victims were found to have been ostracized from their communities, often being stripped of their masculinity or accused of homosexuality due to the predominantly masculinist culture in Bosnia. Other victims feared that coming forward would result in further abuse. A majority of the instances took place in detention camps. Some of these crimes were also committed elsewhere, for example during home raids. The range of abuse varied widely. Some victims were sexually tortured, while others were forced to torture fellow prisoners. Acts included forced oral and anal sex, genital mutilation, and blunt trauma to the genitals. Reasons for these crimes mainly revolved around the humiliation and the assertion of dominance over victims rather than the sexual satisfaction of the perpetrators. The trauma resulting from these crimes included a range of mental and physical health problems including feelings of hopelessness, flashbacks, erectile dysfunction, orgasmic dysfunction, and coital pain. Aftermath Following the end of hostilities with the 1995 Dayton Agreement, there have been sustained efforts to reconcile the opposing factions. Much attention has been paid to the need to understand the reality of what happened during the war, dispel myths, and for responsible leaders to be brought to justice and be encouraged to accept their guilt for the mass rapes and other atrocities. In the aftermath of the conflict, ethnic identity is now of much greater social importance in Bosnia than it was prior to 1992. From the 1960s until the beginning of the war, nearly twelve percent of marriages were mixed (between members of different communities), and young citizens would often refer to themselves as Bosnians rather than identifying their ethnicity. After the conflict it has been effectively mandatory to be identified as either Bosniak, Serb or Croat and this has been a problem for the children of rape victims as they come of age. A medical study of 68 Croatian and Bosniak victims of rape during the 1992‚Äì1995 war found that many suffered psychological problems as a result. None had any psychiatric history prior to the rapes. After the rapes 25 had suicidal thoughts, 58 suffered depression immediately after and 52 were still suffering from depression at the time of the study, one year later. Of the women 44 had been raped more than once and 21 of them had been raped daily throughout their captivity. Twenty-nine of them had become pregnant and seventeen had an abortion. The study reached the conclusion that the rapes had \\"deep immediate and long-term consequences on the mental-health\\" of the women. Rape in the Bosnian war, was used as a \\"weapon of war\\", which affected the communal consciousness of general Bosnian public. As Pierre Bayard puts it, \\"[i]n Bosnia the rapes not only accompanied the advance of the Serbian armies, they were also the result of a concerted policy of cultural eradication.\\" In other words, the rape itself served as an instrument of strategic desecration of Bosnian and/or Bosniak identity and anything related to it. In the study entitled \\"Mass Rape: The War Against Women in Bosnia-Herzegovina\\", Alexandra Stiglmayer et al. conclude:  National and international reactions  In August 1992 media stories publicized the use of rape as a war strategy, and one of the first to bring it to the world's attention was Newsday correspondent Roy Gutman's programme Mass Rape: Muslims Recall Serb Attacks, which aired on 23 August 1992. The United Nations Security Council established the ICTY in response to the conflict's human rights violations. Article 5 of the ICTY charter clarified that the tribunal had the power to prosecute war crimes, and the charter specifically condemned rape as a crime, for which people could be indicted. A Central Intelligence Agency report leaked in 1995 stated that Serb forces were responsible for 90 percent of the atrocities committed during the conflict. A report compiled by a team of experts for the UN, chaired by M. Cherif Bassiouni, reached the same conclusion, calculating that Croat forces were responsible for six percent of the atrocities and Bosniak forces for four percent. After the fall of Srebrenica in July 1995, Madeleine Albright, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told the UN Security Council that \\"[the] whereabouts of some 6,000 Bosniak men and boys from Srebrenica was unknown. But their fate was not. We have enough information to conclude now, however, that the Bosnian Serbs beat, raped, and executed many of the refugees\\"  Legal proceedings  The Tribunal building in The Hague. In the early 1990s, calls were made for legal action to be taken over the possibility of genocide having occurred in Bosnia. The ICTY set the precedent that rape in warfare is a form of torture. By 2011, it had indicted 161 people from all ethnic backgrounds for war crimes, and heard evidence from over 4,000 witnesses. In 1993, the ICTY defined rape as a crime against humanity, and also defined rape, sexual slavery, and sexual violence as international crimes which constitute torture and genocide. Judges from the ICTY ruled during the trial of Dragoljub Kunarac, Radomir Kovaƒç and Milorad Krnojelac that rape had been used by the Bosnian Serb armed forces as an \\"instrument of terror\\". Kunarac was sentenced to 28 years' imprisonment for rape, torture and enslaving women. Kovaƒç, who had raped a 12-year-old child and then sold her into slavery, was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and Krnojelac to 15 years. The ICTY declared that a \\"hellish orgy of persecution\\" had occurred in various camps across Bosnia. In 1997, Radovan Karad≈æiƒá was sued by Bosniak and Croat women in an American court for genocidal rape. He was found liable. The plaintiffs were found to be victims of genocidal rape, and awarded 745 million dollars in damages. On 26 June 1996, the ICTY indicted Dragan Zelenoviƒá on seven counts of rape and torture as crimes against humanity, and seven counts of rape and torture as violations of the customs and laws of war. Zelenoviƒá initially plead not guilty, but during a hearing on 17 December 2007, the trial chamber accepted a guilty plea on three counts of torture and four counts of rape as crimes against humanity. Zelenoviƒá had taken part in the sexual assaults of women at various camps, including the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl and an adult woman. He was given a 15-year sentence for crimes against humanity, which he appealed. The appeal chamber upheld the original sentence. On 10 March 1997, in what is best known as the ƒåelebiƒái case, Hazim Deliƒá, Zejnil Delaliƒá, Zdravko Muciƒá and Esad Land≈æo were put on trial. They were charged under article 7(1) and article 7(3) of the ICT statutes for violating international humanitarian laws. The offenses occurred in the Bosniak- and Croat-controlled ƒåelebiƒái prison camp. Deliƒá was found guilty of using rape as torture, which was a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and that he had violated the laws and customs of war. The trial chamber also found that Muciƒá was guilty of crimes carried out while he was commander of the camp, under the principle of command responsibility, these included gender related atrocities.

(Photograph provided courtesy of the ICTY) On 22 June 1998, Anto Furund≈æija, who had been apprehended on 18 December 1997 by Dutch forces who were operating with NATO, was put on trial in what was one of the shortest trials heard by the ICTY. This was the first case heard by the ICTY which dealt exclusively with charges for rape. Furund≈æija was a Bosnian Croat and local commander of the militia known as The Jokers, who took part in the La≈°va Valley ethnic cleansing and who were under the command of the Croatian Defence Council. Furund≈æija was indicted for individual criminal responsibility, which included \\"committing, planning, instigating, ordering or otherwise aiding and abetting in the planning, preparation or execution of any crimes referred to in articles two and three of the tribunal statute.\\" A single witness, who had been assaulted by Furund≈æija while he interrogated her, gave the majority of testimony during this trial. She was beaten, and another soldier forced her to have oral and vaginal sex while Furund≈æija was present. Furund≈æija did not act to prevent the assault, even though he was in a position of command. His defense counsel argued that the witness was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and had misidentified the accused. The trial chamber gave Furund≈æija two sentences of 10 and 8 years to run concurrently having found him guilty under article three, in that he had violated \\"the laws or customs of war for torture and for outrages upon personal dignity, including rape.\\" In May 2009, Jadranko Prliƒá, who had been prime minister of the self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat wartime state of Herzeg-Bosnia, was convicted of murder, rape and expulsion of Bosniaks. He was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. According to Margot Wallstr√∂m, U.N. Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, only 12 cases out of an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 have been prosecuted as of 2010. By April 2011 the ICTY had indicted 93 men, of these 44 were indicted for crimes related to sexual violence. On 9 March 2005, the War Crimes Chamber of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was officially inaugurated. At first this was a hybrid court of international and national judges, by 2009 all judicial actions were handed over to the domestic authorities. Radovan Stankoviƒá was a member of an elite paramilitary unit from Vukovar which was commanded by Pero Elez. Following the death of Elez, Stankoviƒá took command of Karaman's house, which he ran as a brothel. On 14 November 2006, the domestic court in Sarajevo tried Stankoviƒá and he was given a 16-year sentence for forcing women into prostitution. On 26 May 2007, while being transported to hospital Stankovic escaped from custody. Neƒëo Samard≈æiƒá was given a sentence of 13 years and 4 months after he was found guilty of crimes against humanity. He had been indicted on ten counts, four of which he was found guilty of. These included multiple rape, beatings, murder, and forcing women to be sexual slaves. Samard≈æiƒá was also found guilty of having committed atrocities at Karaman's house. Samard≈æiƒá appealed and was given 24 years' imprisonment having been found guilty on nine of the ten indictments. Gojko Jankoviƒá surrendered himself to the authorities in Bosnia in 2005. He was transferred to the Hague for trial but the ICTY sent him back to Bosnia to be tried before the domestic court. He was indicted for the rights violations of, aiding and abetting and issuing orders during an attack on the non-Serbian population which resulted in the killing, and sexual abuse of, non-Serbians, the majority of whom were Bosniak women and girls. He was given a sentence of 34 years' imprisonment having been found guilty. Dragan Damjanoviƒá (24 years in prison) was convicted of war crimes including murder, torture and rape. Momir Saviƒá was given 18 years' imprisonment in July 2009 for crimes he had carried out while a commander of the Serbian armies \\"Vi≈°egrad Brigade\\". He was convicted for the repeated rape of a Bosniak woman, arson, looting and carrying out executions. On 12 January 2009, ≈Ωeljko Lelek was given 13 years' imprisonment for crimes against humanity, which included rape. Lelek, who was a police officer at the time, was convicted for actions he carried out during the Vi≈°egrad massacres. Miodrag Nikaƒçeviƒá, a police officer from Foƒça, was indicted by the domestic court in 2007 for crimes against humanity carried out in 1992. The indictment against him was fortwo counts of rape. In April 1992, Nikaƒçeviƒá, who was in uniform and armed, forcibly robbed and raped one woman. The second charge was for the abuse of and rape of another woman in July 1992 in Foƒça. During the trial, the defense produced ten witnesses who claimed that Nikaƒçeviƒá had not taken part in any war crimes, and had at times risked his own safety to help others. He was found guilty on 19 February 2009 and sentenced to 8 years' imprisonment for the rapes of both women, and for aiding and abetting in the abduction and illegal detention of a Bosniak civilian, who was later killed at an undisclosed location. Milorad Krnojelac, Janko Janjiƒá, Dragan Gagoviƒá and others were indicted in 1992 for human rights violations committed during the ethnic cleansing of Foƒça. The indictment included a charge of rape. Ante Kovaƒç, who was a commander of the military police in the Croat Defence Council, was indicted on 25 March 2008 on war crimes carried out against Bosniaks in the municipality of Vitez in 1993. The charges included allegations of rapes carried out at detention camps in the region. Kovaƒç was cleared on one count of rape but found guilty on another. He was sentenced to 9 years' imprisonment. Veselin Vlahoviƒá, also known as \\"Batko\\" or the \\"Monster of Grbavica\\", was sentenced to 45 years' imprisonment in March 2013, having been found guilty on more than sixty counts, including the murder, rape and torture of Bosniak and Croat civilians during the Siege of Sarajevo. Vlahoviƒá's sentence was the longest handed down, slightly longer than that of Sanko Kojiƒá, who‚Äîearlier in 2013‚Äîhad been sentenced to 43 years' imprisonment for his role in the Srebrenica massacre.  In popular culture  Grbavica is a feature film directed by Jasmila ≈Ωbaniƒá. It is set in post-war Sarajevo and focuses on Esma, a single mother, and Sara, her daughter, who discovers she is a war baby as her mother had been raped. The film won the 2006 Golden Bear award at the 56th Berlin International Film Festival. ≈Ωbaniƒá had also written and directed a short documentary about the war in 2000, titled Red Rubber Boots. In the Land of Blood and Honey, directed by Angelina Jolie, also deals with the subject of wartime rape. The Abandoned is a 2010 Bosnian film directed by Adis Bakraƒç and written by Zlatko Topƒçiƒá, which is the story of a boy from an orphanage who tries to find out the truth about his origins, it being implied that he is the child of a rape. The 1998 war film Savior is about an American mercenary escorting a Serb woman to a UN safe area after she has been raped and impregnated by a Bosniak soldier. Calling the Ghosts is a documentary about a Bosniak woman and a Croat woman, who both survived being raped and tortured at Omarska. The film ends with the two women giving testimony at the Hague. I Came to Testify is a documentary by PBS which covers the story of sixteen women who were imprisoned by Serb forces in Foƒça, and who later testified against their assailants at the ICTY. The play U ime oca (') is a joint Austrian-Bosnian production, by the National Theater of Tuzla and The Alpha Group production company. The play is a documentary-dance piece directed by Darrel Toulon.

She was the first ship of the U.S. Navy of that name, and is named for the Bagaduce River and a peninsula in Hancock County, Maine. Bagaduce (Tug No. 21) was laid down on 16 July 1918 at Buffalo, New York, by the Ferguson Steel and Iron Company; briefly named Ammonoosuc in February 1919; renamed Bagaduce on 24 February 1919; launched 5 April 1919; and commissioned at Buffalo on 18 September 1919, Lt.(jg.) Frank Mogridge in command. Constructed as part of the World War I building program, Bagaduce was the first of 19 new steel tugs designed to serve as minesweepers and conduct heavy-duty towing work at navy yards. Assigned to the 3d Naval District, she operated at the New York Navy Yard and off the New England coast, providing towing and pilot services to various ships of the fleet. Bagaduce was designated AT-21 on 17 July 1920 when the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull classification and identification. After almost two years of service out of New York, the tug was caught up in the massive fleet reduction caused by the 1922 Washington Naval Conference. The budget cuts and manpower reductions that followed forced the Navy to decommission 376 ships. Bagaduce, one of 15 fleet tugs so affected, was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 2 May 1922. Bagaduce‚Äôs inactivity, however, proved brief. Recommissioned on 9 June 1924, she resumed operations in the 3d Naval District, out of the New York Navy Yard. In early 1926, she transferred to the Washington Navy Yard, but that duty ended in June when she was temporarily returned to the 3d Naval District. The tug was assigned to the salvage of submarine , which had been rammed and sunk by the steamship off Point Judith, Rhode Island, on 25 September 1925. Bagaduce supported and in raising the stricken submersible on 5 July and in towing her into New York three days later. Immediately afterwards, the tug was assigned to the 7th Naval District and arrived at Key West, Florida, on 2 August 1926. Soon after the tug's arrival, on 18 August, a devastating hurricane struck Miami. The next day, Bagaduce loaded nine tons of dry provisions and delivered them to that ravaged city. The tug also helped to clear the harbor of wreckage and supported the naval detachment dispatched from Key West in its efforts to guard the waterfront and post office. Bagaduce‚Äôs involvement in relief efforts continued the following year, when, in late April, she moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, to assist in refugee work and other operations connected with the 1927 flood of the Mississippi River. Her work came to a close on 16 June, and the tug returned to Key West. A month later, on 11 July 1927, Bagaduce got underway for Coco Solo in the Canal Zone, where over succeeding months she provided services to ships and submarines passing through the canal until February 1929 when she returned to Key West. The tug continued normal support operations until early 1932 when she was withdrawn from the 7th Naval District, as part of a district reorganization plan, and decommissioned at Philadelphia on 20 April 1932. Recommissioned on 22 June 1938, Lt. Ernest E. Stevens in command, and assigned duty in the 11th Naval District, Bagaduce arrived at San Diego on 22 October. The tug remained on towing duty in California waters, serving the growing numbers of Pacific Fleet ships, into August 1943 when she changed operational control to the Commander, Western Sea Frontier. She continued towing duties through the end of the war, even after shifting her base of operations from San Diego to San Francisco on 16 December 1943. She was reclassified an old ocean tug and was redesignated ATO-21 on 15 May 1944. Bagaduce was decommissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 22 June 1946, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 July 1946, and she was transferred for disposal to the Maritime Commission at Suisun Bay, California, on 9 January 1947. alt=  References  *  External links  * Ships built in New York (state) Bagaduce-class fleet tugs 1919 ships World War II auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Bagaduce (AT-21)"},{"id":"16054443","text":"USS Preble (1813), sometimes called Commodore Preble, was a sloop which served in the United States Navy from 1813‚Äì1815.

The parish is bounded to the northeast by the River Evenlode, to the southeast partly by the course of Akeman Street Roman road, and on other sides by field boundaries. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 797. For most of its history Finstock was a township of the ancient parish of Charlbury. Finstock became a separate civil parish in the late 19th century. Archaeology A palaeolithic biface was found in the parish near Mount Skippett in 1983. The artefact was found in isolation without any associated archaeological materials so it is difficult to date, but its manufacture shows a mixture of techniques from the Lower Palaeolithic (older than 200,000 years ago) and Middle Palaeolithic (200,000 to 45,000 years ago) periods. Roman coins and Romano-British potsherds have been found in the parish. Manor It is thought that there was a settlement of some kind here at the time of the Domesday survey of 1086 when it formed part of the Hundred of Banbury belonging to the Bishop of Lincoln. In 1135 the village of Finstock is referred to as Fynstoke. In this period, the village formed part of the manor and parish of Charlbury. Finstock Manor House, built in 1660 In the early 16th century the manor of Charlbury and its land, including Finstock, was held by Sir Thomas White, a London tailor who founded St John's College, Oxford, in 1555. The manor was then included in the college's endowment. As the college lands were owned by an absentee landlord, the land was leased to many people including the Lee family of Ditchley ParkDitchley website from 1592 to 1776. The college then resumed direct control until 1857, when the lordship of the manor passed to Francis Spencer, 2nd Lord Churchill of Wychwood, the owner of Cornbury Park.Cornbury Park It remains in the possession of Cornbury Park today although most of the manorial rights have lapsed and much of the village of Finstock is now freehold. Finstock Manor House is 17th-century and has a date stone saying 1660. It is an L-shaped house with three gables on each of its longer sides and an attic window in each gable. All the attic windows in the gables are elliptical and one is oeil-de-boeuf. The roof is of Stonesfield slate. The house is a Grade II* listed building. Parish church Holy Trinity Church of England parish church is a Gothic Revival building of 1841. Its ornate chancel was added in 1905 and its elaborate south window by the architect P. Morley Horder in 1929. T. S. Eliot came to Finstock to be received into the Church of England. William Force Stead was a fellow American and came to England as an American consul but soon found that his real bents in life were literature and religion. He was ordained, became chaplain of Worcester College, Oxford and after meeting Eliot in 1923 (with whom he shared a love of cats) steadily drew him towards Anglicanism and agreed to baptise him. He was then living in \\"a fine seventeenth century gabled house at Finstock\\", Finstock ManorFinstock website and invited Eliot to stay there to meet his godfathers, B. H. Streeter and Vere Somerset, before his baptism at Finstock on 29 June 1927. The novelist Barbara Pym lived at Finstock after her retirement and is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity. The current Vicar, the Reverend Paul Mansell, arrived in February 2010; he was trained at Ripon College, Cuddeston and ordained at Christ Church, Oxford. Economic and social history Finstock Church of England Primary School, built in 1860 Finstock, together with its neighbours Charlbury, Fawler and Leafield, lay in a clearing of Wychwood Forest that used to stretch from Woodstock to Burford. Much of the forest land was cleared for growing arable crops and during the Middle Ages barley was the main crop in Finstock. Other land was used for sheep grazing and many of the people of Finstock were involved in the wool industry ‚Äî the carding being done by men and boys and the spinning by women. Building of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway (OW&W;) along the Evenlode Valley began 1845 and the line was opened in 1853. It passes through the northeastern edge of Finstock parish about from the village. Originally its nearest station was , about from Finstock. The Great Western Railway took over the OW&W; in 1862 and opened Finstock railway station in 1934. Glove making at the village hall site by the women and agricultural labouring on nearby land by the men and boys, used to be the principal occupations of the people of Finstock in the earlier part of the 20th century. Now many inhabitants of Finstock commute by car and bus to Witney, Chipping Norton and Oxford. Finstock is now a separate civil and ecclesiastical parish,Finstock website: Parish church its population mostly living along the sides of a large triangle formed by the main Witney-Charlbury road (west to north), School Road (east) and Finstock High Street (south).

Population History Evidence of Gallo-Roman habitation can be seen from the air, featuring overlapping enclosures and a big farm building or villa. Human remains and three tombs dating back to the Merovingian era have been discovered within the commune boundaries. In the early Middle Ages, vines were cultivated in Picardie, and in this region in particular, as testified at Salou√´l by the parcel of land known as ‚ÄòLes Vignettes‚Äô. In 1342 a fulling mill was in use on the river Selle, to process woollen cloth, which had previously been done manually. Originally, Salou√´l was part of the parish town of Saleux. The separation was made by imperial decree on December 11, 1864. Its cantonal allocation has changed since 1790: first integrated into the canton of Bovelles, then to Sains and since 1879 the canton of Boves. With Salou√´l being so close to Amiens, it wasn't just involved in rural activity over the centuries, unlike most of the surrounding communes. Since the Middle Ages, the development of craft industries and small workshops occupied most of the population. After the Second World War, and in particular since the years 1965‚Äì1970, the commune has been transformed by the successive establishment of the campus of a university and a large hospital.

The abbots of Corbie, as masters of Maisni√®res, collected tithes and were also responsible for justice. Maisni√®res cultivated hops in the 17th century. A century later, the hamlets of Courtieux, Harcelaines and Monchelet were joined into the one parish. The railway arrived in 1872, as part of the line serving Fr√©vent to Gamaches. A single-storey schoolhouse was built in 1878. A second floor was added in 1954 so that two classes could be taught separately. The school was used as a billet for Australian troops during World War I, as was the ch√¢teau. During the Second World War, the Germans occupied homes, the old presbytery and the ch√¢teau, which served as the Kommandantur. On 3 July 1944, a V1 rocket fell on the homes between the church and the presbytery. It killed 3 children from one family and wounded a dozen others. It had been launched from a site less than way, at Longuemort and had failed to take off properly. Maisni√®res was liberated on 2 September 1944 by a Canadian armoured division on their way to Abbeville, where they joined up with the 1st Polish armoured division, to drive out the Germans. Places of interest Dovecote at the Visse watermill Visse watermill Fed by the waters of the river Vimeuse, this is the last survivor of 14 mills that once worked along the river. It was owned by the abbey of Corbie but confiscated during the French Revolution and sold. In 1837, the miller sought and got permission to build a new mill upstream, the present mill. The wheel was restored in 1992 and can be seen from a small bridge. On an engineer‚Äôs map from 1854, there appears to be three active watermills on the Vimeuse. A windmill, owned by the abbey of Corbie, once stood on the small hill in Visse. The medieval ch√¢teau of the De Maisni√®res family Only a small part of the motte wall still stands, 35 m long by 25 m high, on the flat top of the hill near the church, dominating the neighbourhood to the south and the west. It was destroyed between the years 1380-1400. The family that owned the castle died out in the following years, having been lords (seigneurs there for 200 years. The first lord, Guy de Maisni√®res, the first of that name built the castle when Guillaume, Count of Ponthieu, in November 1218, established irrefutably that Guy was the next-born brother to his own father, Jean, Count of Ponthieu.Dom Grenier, √† la Biblioth√®que nationale, vol. 57 bis, folio 48.Ref√©rence: Nobiliaire du Ponthieu.

Employment Agriculture is the main occupation within the commune, though in earlier times, sawmills (brought in by the Spanish) and sewing gave work to many of the inhabitants. The coming of the railway stimulated the economic activities of the villages. A station opened in Maisni√®res on 9 May 1872. During the sugarbeet harvesting season, 16 trains a day were loaded. All the local lines were closed between 1972 and 1975. Monchelet, hamlet of Maisni√®res, had a very busy dairy and cheese-making business from 1900 to 1977.Jean-Marie Ternisien - Historique de la Laiterie de Monchelet-Maisni√®res - 2006 Production was principally dedicated to the famous Camembert L'Oiseau bleu, known throughout Picardie and even exported from France.

Later, Ananka comes face-to-face with a squirrel painted on a side of a building holding up a sign that reads, \\"YOUR MONEY WILL SET ALL THE ANIMALS FREE.\\" Ananka does not think Kiki painted the squirrel, since Kiki could \\"speak a dozen languages and kick butts twice her size, but couldn't draw a convincing stick figure.\\" Ananka then goes to her meeting place, expecting to see Kiki and finish their map of the Shadow City. After a while she decides to go home, stopping by Kiki's house, which is empty. Everything is perfectly in place except that Verushka's wheelchair is sitting in the middle of the room.

Manuguerra was born in Tunis, Tunisia, to Italian parents, who later moved to Argentina. He came late to music, starting his vocal study at the age of 35, at the Buenos Aires Music Conservatory, with Umberto Landi. He made his debut as a tenor, in Mozart's Requiem. He settled in France in 1961, and after new studies, made his debut the following year as a baritone in the role of Valentin in Faust, at the Op√©ra de Lyon where he was to remain for three years. Manuguerra made his Paris Op√©ra debut in 1966, as Rigoletto. He appeared throughout France, and sang on French radio particularly in Verdi operas such as, Nabucco, Ernani, I masnadieri, Luisa Miller, as well as in I vespri siciliani and Don Carlo, both in their original French versions. After singing widely in Europe, Manuguerra made his American debut in 1968, as G√©rard in Andrea Ch√©nier, in Seattle. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut on 11 January 1971 as Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor, other roles included Barnaba in La Gioconda, Carlo in La forza del destino, Amonasro in Aida, Alfio in Cavalleria rusticana, Tonio in Pagliacci, and others. He also appeared at the San Francisco Opera and the Dallas Opera. Manuguerra had a rich and supple voice enabling him to excel in both belcanto and verismo repertoire, with Verdi being always at the core, which his impressive discography clearly demonstrates. Matteo Manuguerra enjoyed a long career and was still active when he died suddenly of a heart attack, in Montpellier, France.

At the end of the investigation Wood stated that the Broadwell case was \\"one of the strongest circumstantial cases ever tried.\\"Investigation of Lucina Broadwell Murder by James Wood, Jr., p. 2, available at the Harvard Law School Library. When Wood arrived in Barre, he met with Frank C. Archibald, the Vermont Attorney General, and other local officials.Wood Investigation, p. 4. It had already been deduced that Lucina had been murdered at the Buzzell Hotel and her body moved to the garden where it was ultimately found. Wood interviewed Harry Broadwell, because at that time, it was largely believed that Harry killed Lucina. Wood, however, quickly dismissed this theory since Harry had \\"a perfect alibi\\" for all of his activities the night of the murder.Wood Investigation, p. 4-6. Harry did reveal that he believed his wife was \\"sporty.\\"Wood Investigation, p. 5. Wood quickly identified George R. Long as a person of interest. Long, at that time, was a resident of the Parker house. Harry had told Wood that he suspected Lucina was having an affair with a resident of the Parker house.Wood Investigation, p. 7. When initially questioned, Long denied having met Lucina. Wood also followed another lead provided by Harry Broadwell. Harry had told Wood that Lucina had a good friend by the name of Grace Grimes, who had relocated to the Boston area. Wood immediately had his office locate Grace. When interviewed, Grace confirmed that she often corresponded with Lucina by letter and that her most recent letter was from the day of the murder. In the letter, Lucina wrote about meeting a lodger of Mrs. Isabelle Parker's named George.Wood Investigation, p. 8. During the interview with Grace it surfaced that Parker ran a brothel and hosted \\"so-called cheating parties.\\"Wood Investigation, p. 9. Lucina had participated on numerous occasions.Wood Investigation, p. 8-9. Upon his return to Vermont, Wood interviewed Isabelle Parker, who admitted that Lucina had been at her house the night of the murder and met with Long. There was evidence that Lucina and Long had dinner together and her autopsy showed that she had eaten approximately one hour before her murder.Wood Investigation, p. 10. A search of Parker's house revealed the \\"Famous Red Book\\", which listed her customers, \\"many prominent people, both male and female, of Barre, Vermont.\\" Wood deduced how Parker operated her brothel in downtown Barre: > She would go about Barre and get a line of the different men and women who > were inclined to be a little sporty. For example, if she knew I was a > married man and like to step out, she would make it her business to form my > acquaintance and eventually tell me that a certain woman, either married or > single, was infatuated with me and would like to meet me. She would invite > me down toher [sic] house at a certain time and tell me to come in the back > door and when I arrived, would introduce me to some woman, either married or > single, whom she had told the same story to that she had told me, namely she > would tell the woman that I desired to meet her. In that way she would bring > the couples together and they would have their parties there, and naturally > the men would pay her something for the use of the room or rooms.Wood > Investigation, p. 11. One week after Broadwell's body was found, Wood questioned Long once again. After disclosing what Parker admitted to, Long finally confessed to knowing Lucina, but denied murdering her.Wood Investigation, p. 12. Wood's investigation proved invaluable to the Broadwell prosecution team. It was Wood who found two major clues: # A tire track beside the street curb near where the body was found, and # The owner of the handkerchief that was tied around Lucina's neck.Bottamini, p. 43. The tire track was eventually traced back to a car rented by Long. The handkerchief's owner, Eddie Barron, testified at Long's trial that the handkerchief had been given to Long by Barron. In addition, Wood's entire interview with Long would also be read to the jury during the trial.Jill Lepore, The Case of the Blue Bottle, The Last Archive podcast Wood kept very detailed notes. At one point in his report he stated that he \\"had become disgusted and had left Vermont.\\" He also recorded how the local officials \\"told me they thought I was crazy and thought I had been on a wild goose chase.\\" Another example of how Wood included details about his own experiences intermixed with his investigation is his discussion of his first night in Vermont: > I then spent the entire night at work alone on this case. I visited the lot > where the body was found, visited the Buzzell Hotel, studied the lightening > conditions and decided then that Mrs. Broadwell wasnot [sic] killed in the > Buzzell Hotel. I returned to the hotel shortly before breakfast, no one > knowing that I had been working all night.  Arrests and trials On May 15, George Long and Isabelle Parker were arrested and taken to the Washington County jail in Montpelier.Belding, pp. 25-26. Arraignments took place on May 16 and both Long and Parker were assigned attorney J. Ward Carver for their defense.Belding, pp. 30-31. Earle Davis represented the State. The grand jury hearing was scheduled for June 5.Belding, p. 37. During the period between the arraignments and the grand jury proceedings, it was found that George Long was actually George Rath, and had only taken the name \\"Long\\" before moving to Vermont. It was alleged that he had an extensive criminal record.Belding, p. 36. On June 11, Long and Parker were indicted by the grand jury.Belding, p. 41. =Trial of George R. Long = George Long's trial began on October 7, 1919, at 9 a.m. with jury selection.Belding, pp. 48-49. On October 10, opening statements were made by the prosecution and the defense, with a courtroom filled to capacity.Belding, p. 50. On October 20, Long's second statement to authorities was read into evidence at the trial. In this statement he admitted to paying Lucina for sexual relations and Mrs. Parker for providing the room.Belding, p. 78. On October 24, Daisy Luce testified that she spoke with George Long the morning that Lucina's body was discovered. During this conversation, Long stated: \\"There would be one less woman in Barre.\\"Belding, p. 109. Long's trial lasted one month before it went to the jury. There were a hundred witnesses. In its closing statement, the defense argued that Long had no motive to kill Lucina since they were intimate partners.Belding, p. 132. The prosecution, on the other hand, demonized Long, referring to him as a \\"thing.\\"Belding, p. 135. The prosecution relied heavily on the circumstantial evidence provided by the Wood Detective Agency.Belding, pp. 136-37. On October 31, the judge gave the jury its instructions.Belding, p. 138. That afternoon, the jury came back with its verdict. At 3:30, the jury announced that George Long was found guilty of the second-degree murder of Lucina C. Broadwell. Sentencing was set for November 5, at which time he was ordered to serve a term of life imprisonment.Belding, p. 141. After sentencing, Long was moved to the Windsor State Prison to serve his sentence. He appealed his case with exceptions made during the trial. In 1922, the Vermont Supreme Court held in State v. Long that \\"[t]he record shows a brutal killing--one unmistakably indicating cool depravity of heart and wanton cruelty.\\"State v. Long, 95 Vt. 485, 115 A.734, 739 (1922). Long's appeal was denied. = Trial of Isabelle Parker = Once the Long trial concluded, Isabelle Parker became the court's focus. Parker, while initially implicated in Lucina's murder, was only charged with \\"conducting a house of ill fame.\\"Belding, p. 151. Parker pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to two to four years imprisonment. Due to her health, officials allowed her to remain free while she petitioned the governor for clemency. Her petition was denied on April 23, 1920, and she began her sentence on April 26.Belding, p. 161. Parker served 2.5 years. She died on September 5, 1922.  Public interest and legacy  Lucina's murder captivated the residents of Barre, and indeed the entire state of Vermont. There were almost daily reports on the murder, its investigation, and the trials of Long and Parker, in the Barre Daily Times throughout the summer and fall of 1919. In 1990, Richard Bottamini published \\"The Bawdy House Murder\\" in The Central Vermont Magazine, which gives a concise history of the murder and the subsequent trial of George Long. In 2006, Vermont historian Patricia Belding published One Less Woman, a book that chronicles the events following Lucina's murder. Belding's book relies heavily on the newspaper reports of the Barre Daily Times for information regarding the murder and the trials of both Long and Parker. The book also provides pictures of the main players in the book, as well as the actual murder scene. In a 2020 podcast, Jill Lepore, a history professor at Harvard University and a writer for The New Yorker magazine, revisited the case and the original file transcripts and concluded that whether he was guilty or not, Long was convicted on moral grounds: not because of any material evidence, but he because he had provided a contraceptive to Mrs. Broadwell, had sex with her, and lied about it.

He was trusted by Emperor Zhongzong's powerful wife Empress Wei, who was his cousin, and after she was killed in a coup after Emperor Zhongzong's death, he was also killed.  Background  It is not known when Wei Wen was born. His father was Wei Xuanyan (ÈüãÁéÑÂÑº), who served as a prefectural prefect late in the reign of Emperor Gaozong. Wei Wen's cousin‚Äîthe daughter of Wei Xuanyan's younger brother Wei Xuanzhen (ÈüãÁéÑË≤û) -- was the wife and crown princess of Emperor Gaozong's son Li Zhe the Crown Prince, and on that account was quickly promoted. After Emperor Gaozong's death in 683, Li Zhe took the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), but soon ran afoul of his mother Empress Dowager Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), who retained power as regent, partly over his desire to promote Wei Xuanzhen to be chancellor. In spring 684, she deposed Emperor Zhongzong to be the Prince of Luling and exiled him and his wife. (She subsequently took the throne herself as \\"emperor\\" in 690.) Wei Wen thus, for the time being, received no help from his relationship with his cousin, and when he served as a probationary official, he was accused of receiving bribes and removed from his office.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown, and Li Zhe, then carrying the title of crown prince and having changed his name to Li Xian, returned to the throne. His wife again became empress, and Wei Wen, as her closest male relative (as her father Wei Xuanzhen had died in exile and her brothers Wei Xun (ÈüãÊ¥µ), Wei Hao (ÈüãÊµ©), Wei Dong (ÈüãÊ¥û), and Wei Ci (ÈüãÊ≥ö) had been killed by the local tribal chieftain Ning Chengji (ÂØßÊâøÂü∫)), was made the minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu) and created the Duke of Lu. Many of his relatives also were honored, as Empress Wei wanted to promote her relatives. In 709, Wei Wen was made Taizi Shaobao (Â§™Â≠êÂ∞ë‰øù), an advisor to the crown prince (but entirely honorary post at that time, as there was no crown prince) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a de facto chancellor.  Death  In 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly‚Äîa death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and her daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle, so that Empress Wei could eventually be \\"emperor\\" like Wu Zetian, and Li Guo'er could be crown princess. Empress Wei initially did not announce Emperor Zhongzong's death, and immediately put Wei Wen in overall command of the imperial guards, with his cousin Wei Xuan (ÈüãÁíø) and nephews Wei Bo (ÈüãÊí≠) and Gao Song (È´òÂµ©) in command as well. Meanwhile, though, under a plan drafted by Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, Emperor Zhongzong's son by another concubine, Li Chongmao would be named emperor. Empress Wei would serve as empress dowager and regent, while Emperor Zhongzong's younger brother Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, would serve as coregent; Consort Shangguan subsequently formalized this in a will she drafted posthumously for Emperor Zhongzong. Wei Wen and another chancellor, Zong Chuke, however, opposed this plan on the grounds that this would require her and Li Dan to frequently confer, which violated Confucian principles that a brother-in-law and a sister-in-law should not converse with each other. Under Zong's and Wei Wen's insistence, the other chancellors did not dare to oppose their will, and Li Dan was not made coregent. Li Chongmao soon took the throne (as Emperor Shang), with Empress Wei serving as empress dowager and regent. Meanwhile, Zong feared Li Dan and Princess Taiping, and was advocating to Empress Dowager Wei and Wei Wen that Li Dan and Princess Taiping should be killed. At the same time, though, Princess Taiping and Li Dan's son Li Longji had received news of this and were planning a coup‚Äîwhich was facilitated by that Wei Bo and Gao were alienating the imperial guards by being harsh to the guards, trying to establish their authority. Li Longji took this opportunity to encourage the guard commanders to rise against the Wei party, and on July 21, Princess Taiping and Li Longji, with the imperial guards' support, rose in rebellion, killing Empress Dowager Wei and Li Guo'er. Li Dan was named regent. Wei Xuan, Wei Bo, and Gao were killed on during the coup, but Wei Wen was not executed until July 24, for reasons unclear in history. After his death, his clan was massacred.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 183. * New Book of Tang, vol. 206. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 209.

The modern city of Corinth is located approximately northeast of the ancient ruins. Since 1896, systematic archaeological investigations of the Corinth Excavations by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens have revealed large parts of the ancient city, and recent excavations conducted by the Greek Ministry of Culture have brought to light important new facets of antiquity. For Christians, Corinth is well known from the two letters of Saint Paul in the New Testament, First and Second Corinthians. Corinth is also mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as part of Paul the Apostle's missionary travels. In addition, the second book of Pausanias' Description of Greece is devoted to Corinth. Ancient Corinth was one of the largest and most important cities of Greece, with a population of 90,000 in 400 BC. The Romans demolished Corinth in 146 BC, built a new city in its place in 44 BC, and later made it the provincial capital of Greece. History =Prehistory and founding myths= Neolithic pottery suggests that the site of Corinth was occupied from at least as early as 6500 BC, and continually occupied into the Early Bronze Age, when, it has been suggested, the settlement acted as a centre of trade. However, there is a dramatic drop in ceramic remains during the Early Helladic II phase and only sparse ceramic remains in the EHIII and MH phases; thus, it appears that the area was very sparsely inhabited in the period immediately before the Mycenaean period. There was a settlement on the coast near Lechaion which traded across the Corinthian Gulf; the site of Corinth itself was likely not heavily occupied again until around 900 BC, when it is believed that the Dorians settled there. According to Corinthian myth as reported by Pausanias, the city was founded by Corinthos, a descendant of the god Zeus.Pausanias, Description of Greece 2.1.1 However, other myths suggest that it was founded by the goddess Ephyra, a daughter of the Titan Oceanus, thus the ancient name of the city (also Ephyra). There is evidence that the city was destroyed around 2000 BC. Some ancient names for the place are derived from a pre-Greek \\"Pelasgian\\" language, such as Korinthos. It seems likely that Corinth was also the site of a Bronze Age Mycenaean palace-city, like Mycenae, Tiryns, or Pylos. According to myth, Sisyphus was the founder of a race of ancient kings at Corinth. It was also in Corinth that Jason, the leader of the Argonauts, abandoned Medea.Euripides, Medea During the Trojan War, as portrayed in the Iliad, the Corinthians participated under the leadership of Agamemnon. In a Corinthian myth recounted to Pausanias in the 2nd century AD,Pausanias, Description of Greece ii. 1.6 and 4.7. Briareus, one of the Hecatonchires, was the arbitrator in a dispute between Poseidon and Helios, between the sea and the sun. His verdict was that the Isthmus of Corinth belonged to Poseidon and the acropolis of Corinth (Acrocorinth) belonged to Helios. Thus, Greeks of the Classical age accounted for the archaic cult of the sun-titan in the highest part of the site. The Upper Peirene spring is located within the walls of the acropolis. \\"The spring, which is behind the temple, they say was the gift of Asopus to Sisyphus. The latter knew, so runs the legend, that Zeus had ravished Aegina, the daughter of Asopus, but refused to give information to the seeker before he had a spring given him on the Acrocorinthus.\\" (Pausanias, 2.5.1). =Corinth under the Bacchiadae= View of Ancient Corinth Corinth had been a backwater in 8th-century Greece.√âdouard Will, Korinthiaka: recherches sur l'histoire et la civilisation de Corinth des origines aux guerres m√©diques (Paris: Boccard) 1955. The Bacchiadae (Ancient Greek: ŒíŒ±Œ∫œáŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ±Œπ Bakkhiadai) were a tightly-knit Doric clan and the ruling kinship group of archaic Corinth in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, a period of expanding Corinthian cultural power. In 747 BC (a traditional date), an aristocratic ousted the Bacchiadai Prytaneis and reinstituted the kingship, about the time the Kingdom of Lydia (the endonymic Basileia Sfard) was at its greatest, coinciding with the ascent of Basileus Meles, King of Lydia. The Bacchiadae, numbering perhaps a couple of hundred adult males, took power from the last king Telestes (from the House of Sisyphos) in Corinth). Telestes was murdered by two Bacchiads named Arieus and Perantas. (Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I p. 450). It has been debated what extent this early history is a genealogical myth. The Bacchiads dispensed with kingship and ruled as a group, governing the city by annually electing a prytanis (who held the kingly position; (Stewart Irvin Oost, \\"Cypselus the Bacchiad\\" Classical Philology 67.1 (January 1972, pp. 10‚Äì30) p. 10f.) See: rex sacrorum. for his brief term),Diodorus Siculus, 7.9.6; Pausanias 2.4.4. probably a council (though none is specifically documented in the scant literary materials), and a polemarchos to head the army. During Bacchiad rule from 747 to 650 BC, Corinth became a unified state. Large scale public buildings and monuments were constructed at this time. In 733 BC, Corinth established colonies at Corcyra and Syracuse. By 730 BC, Corinth emerged as a highly advanced Greek city with at least 5,000 people. Aristotle tells the story of Philolaus of Corinth, a Bacchiad who was a lawgiver at Thebes. He became the lover of Diocles, the winner of the Olympic games. They both lived for the rest of their lives in Thebes. Their tombs were built near one another and Philolaus' tomb points toward the Corinthian country, while Diocles' faces away.Politics, 1274a In 657 BC, polemarch Cypselus obtained an oracle from Delphi which he interpreted to mean that he should rule the city.Histories, Herodotus, Book 5.92 E He seized power and exiled the Bacchiadae.His mother had been of the Bacchiadae, but she was lame and married outside the clan. =Corinth under the tyrants= Cypselus or Kypselos () was the first tyrant of Corinth in the 7th century BC. From 658‚Äì628 BC, he removed the Bacchiad aristocracy from power and ruled for three decades. He built temples to Apollo and Poseidon in 650 BC. Apollo Temple has been built in Doric style on the ruins of earlier temple, being a good example of peripteral temple, supported by 38 columns, 7 of which are still in place. Archeological site located close to Temple of Apollo. Archeological site of Ancient Theater first built in Corinth in 5th c. BC. The Theater could seat around 15000 spectators. Aristotle reports that \\"Cypselus of Corinth had made a vow that if he became master of the city, he would offer to Zeus the entire property of the Corinthians. Accordingly, he commanded them to make a return of their possessions.\\"Economics, Book 2. 1346a, Aristotle The city sent forth colonists to found new settlements in the 7th century BC, under the rule of Cypselus (r. 657‚Äì627 BC) and his son Periander (r. 627‚Äì587 BC). Those settlements were Epidamnus (modern day Durr√´s, Albania), Syracuse, Ambracia (modern day town of Lefkas), Corcyra (modern day town of Corfu), and Anactorium. Periander also founded Apollonia in Illyria (modern day Fier, Albania) and Potidaea (in Chalcidice). Corinth was also one of the nine Greek sponsor-cities to found the colony of Naukratis in Ancient Egypt, founded to accommodate the increasing trade volume between the Greek world and pharaonic Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Psammetichus I of the 26th dynasty. Greek city-states tended to overthrow their traditional hereditary priest-kings, with increased wealth and more complicated trade relations and social structures. Corinth led the way as the richest archaic polis. The tyrants usually seized power at the head of some popular support, like the signori of late medieval and Renaissance Italy. Often the tyrants calmed the populace by upholding existing laws and customs and strict conservatism in cult practices. A cult of personality naturally substituted for the divine right of the former legitimate royal house, as it did in Renaissance Italy. Temple of Apollo, Ancient Corinth. Periander (Œ†ŒµœÅŒØŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ) (r. 627‚Äì587 BC). Cypselus was the son of E√´tion and a disfigured woman named Labda. He was a member of the Bacchiad kin and usurped the power in archaic matriarchal right of his mother. According to Herodotus, the Bacchiadae heard two prophecies from the Delphic oracle that the son of E√´tion would overthrow their dynasty, and they planned to kill the baby once he was born. However, the newborn smiled at each of the men sent to kill him, and none of them could bear to strike the blow. Labda then hid the baby in a chest,An etiological myth-element to account for the name Cypselus (cypsele, \\"chest\\") and the men could not find him once they had composed themselves and returned to kill him. (Compare the infancy of Perseus.) The ivory chest of Cypselus was richly worked and adorned with gold. It was a votive offering at Olympia, where Pausanias gave it a minute description in his 2nd century AD travel guide.Pausanias, 5.18.7. Cypselus grew up and fulfilled the prophecy. Corinth had been involved in wars with Argos and Corcyra, and the Corinthians were unhappy with their rulers. Cypselus was polemarch at the time (around 657 BC), the archon in charge of the military, and he used his influence with the soldiers to expel the king. He also expelled his other enemies, but allowed them to set up colonies in northwestern Greece. He also increased trade with the colonies in Italy and Sicily. He was a popular ruler and, unlike many later tyrants, he did not need a bodyguard and died a natural death. He ruled for thirty years and was succeeded as tyrant by his son Periander in 627 BC.Histories, Herodotus, Book 5.92F The treasury that Cypselus built at Delphi was apparently still standing in the time of Herodotus, and the chest of Cypselus was seen by Pausanias at Olympia in the 2nd century AD. Periander brought Corcyra to order in 600 BC. Periander was considered one of the Seven Wise Men of Greece.Diogenes Laertius, i. 13. During his reign, the first Corinthian coins were struck. He was the first to attempt to cut across the Isthmus to create a seaway between the Corinthian and the Saronic Gulfs. He abandoned the venture due to the extreme technical difficulties that he met, but he created the Diolkos instead (a stone-built overland ramp). The era of the Cypselids was Corinth's golden age, and ended with Periander's nephew Psammetichus, named after the hellenophile Egyptian Pharaoh Psammetichus I (see above). Periander killed his wife Melissa. His son Lycophron found out and shunned him, and Periander exiled the son to Corcyra.Histories, Herodotus, Book 3.52 Periander later wanted Lycophron to replace him as ruler of Corinth, and convinced him to come home to Corinth on the condition that Periander go to Corcyra. The Corcyreans heard about this and killed Lycophron to keep away Periander.Histories, Herodotus, Book 3.53Herodotus relates that Arion the harpist was sailing home on a Corinthian vessel when the crew decided to rob and kill him. He begged them to let him sing a last song before killing him. He threw himself overboard and escaped to Taernarus on the back of a dolphin. He presented himself to Periander, who then condemned the sailors (Herodotus Histories Book 1.24). =Archaic Corinth after the tyrants= 581 BC: Periander's nephew and successor was assassinated, ending the tyranny. 581 BC: the Isthmian Games were established by leading families. 570 BC: the inhabitants started to use silver coins called 'colts' or 'foals'. 550 BC: Construction of the Temple of Apollo at Corinth (early third quarter of the 6th century BC).Bookidis N., \\"Corinthian Terracotta Sculpture and the Temple of Apollo,\\" Hesperia 69, 4, 2000, p. 386 550 BC: Corinth allied with Sparta. 525 BC: Corinth formed a conciliatory alliance with Sparta against Argos. 519 BC: Corinth mediated between Athens and Thebes. Around 500 BC: Athenians and Corinthians entreated Spartans not to harm Athens by restoring the tyrant.Histories, Herodotus, Book 5.93 Just before the classical period, according to Thucydides, the Corinthians developed the trireme which became the standard warship of the Mediterranean until the late Roman period. Corinth fought the first naval battle on record against the Hellenic city of Corcyra.Thucydides 1:13 The Corinthians were also known for their wealth due to their strategic location on the isthmus, through which all land traffic had to pass en route to the Peloponnese, including messengers and traders.Thucydides, Book 1:13 =Classical Corinth= Corinthian stater.Obverse:Pegasus with Koppa (8px) (or Qoppa) beneath. Reverse:Athena wearing Corinthian helmet. Koppa symbolised the archaic spelling of the city name (œòœåœÅŒπŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ). Statues in the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth. Corinthian order columns in ancient Corinth. In classical times, Corinth rivaled Athens and Thebes in wealth, based on the Isthmian traffic and trade. Until the mid-6th century, Corinth was a major exporter of black-figure pottery to city-states around the Greek world, later losing their market to Athenian artisans. In classical times and earlier, Corinth had a temple of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, employing some thousand hetairas (temple prostitutes) (see also Temple prostitution in Corinth). The city was renowned for these temple prostitutes, who served the wealthy merchants and the powerful officials who frequented the city. Lais, the most famous hetaira, was said to charge tremendous fees for her extraordinary favours. Referring to the city's exorbitant luxuries, Horace is quoted as saying: \\"non licet omnibus adire Corinthum\\" (\\"Not everyone is able to go to Corinth\\"). Corinth was also the host of the Isthmian Games. During this era, Corinthians developed the Corinthian order, the third main style of classical architecture after the Doric and the Ionic. The Corinthian order was the most complicated of the three, showing the city's wealth and the luxurious lifestyle, while the Doric order evoked the rigorous simplicity of the Spartans, and the Ionic was a harmonious balance between these two following the cosmopolitan philosophy of Ionians like the Athenians. The city had two main ports: to the west on the Corinthian Gulf lay Lechaion, which connected the city to its western colonies (Greek: apoikiai) and Magna Graecia, while to the east on the Saronic Gulf the port of Kenchreai served the ships coming from Athens, Ionia, Cyprus and the Levant. Both ports had docks for the city's large navy. Street in ancient Corinth. In 491 BC, Corinth mediated between Syracuse and Gela in Sicily. During the years 481‚Äì480 BC, the Conference at the Isthmus of Corinth (following conferences at Sparta) established the Hellenic League, which allied under the Spartans to fight the war against Persia. The city was a major participant in the Persian Wars, sending 400 soldiers to defend ThermopylaeHistories, Herodotus, Book 7:202 and supplying forty warships for the Battle of Salamis under Adeimantos and 5,000 hoplites with their characteristic Corinthian helmets) in the following Battle of Plataea. The Greeks obtained the surrender of Theban collaborators with the Persians. Pausanias took them to Corinth where they were put to death.Histories, Book 9:88, Herodotus Following the Battle of Thermopylae and the subsequent Battle of Artemisium, which resulted in the captures of Euboea, Boeotia, and Attica, the Greco-Persian Wars were at a point where now most of mainland Greece to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth had been overrun. Corinthian order. Herodotus, who was believed to dislike the Corinthians, mentions that they were considered the second best fighters after the Athenians.Histories, Herodotus, Book 9:105 In 458 BC, Corinth was defeated by Athens at Megara. Peloponnesian War In 435 BC, Corinth and its colony Corcyra went to war over Epidamnus.The Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, Book 1:29 In 433 BC, Athens allied with Corcyra against Corinth.The Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, Book 1:45 The Corinthian war against the Corcyrans was the largest naval battle between Greek city states until that time.Thucycdides, Book 1, \\"The dispute over Corcyra\\", 50 In 431 BC, one of the factors leading to the Peloponnesian War was the dispute between Corinth and Athens over Corcyra, which probably stemmed from the traditional trade rivalry between the two cities. Three Syracusan generals went to Corinth seeking allies against Athenian invasion.Thucydides, Book 6:73 The Corinthians \\"voted at once to aid [the Syracusans] heart and soul\\". They also sent a group to Lacedaemon to rouse Spartan assistance. After a convincing speech from the Athenian renegade Alcibiades, the Spartans agreed to send troops to aid the Sicilians.Thucydides, Book 6:88 In 404 BC, Sparta refused to destroy Athens, angering the Corinthians. Corinth joined Argos, Boeotia, and Athens against Sparta in the Corinthian War. Demosthenes later used this history in a plea for magnanimous statecraft, noting that the Athenians of yesteryear had had good reason to hate the Corinthians and Thebans for their conduct during the Peloponnesian War,especially the latter part, the Decelan War yet they bore no malice whatever.On The Crown Book 18.96 Corinthian War In 395 BC, after the end of the Peloponnesian War, Corinth and Thebes, dissatisfied with the hegemony of their Spartan allies, moved to support Athens against Sparta in the Corinthian War.On the Peace, Isocrates, Speech 68, section 68Hellenica, Books 3‚Äì7, Xenophon As an example of facing danger with knowledge, Aristotle used the example of the Argives who were forced to confront the Spartans in the battle at the Long Walls of Corinth in 392 BC.Nicomachean Ethics, Book 3.8 379‚Äì323 BC In 379 BC, Corinth, switching back to the Peloponnesian League, joined Sparta in an attempt to defeat Thebes and eventually take over Athens. In 366 BC, the Athenian Assembly ordered Chares to occupy the Athenian ally and install a democratic government. This failed when Corinth, Phlius and Epidaurus allied with Boeotia. Demosthenes recounts how Athens had fought the Spartans in a great battle near Corinth. The city decided not to harbor the defeated Athenian troops, but instead sent heralds to the Spartans. But the Corinthian heralds opened their gates to the defeated Athenians and saved them. Demosthenes notes that they ‚Äúchose along with you, who had been engaged in battle, to suffer whatever might betide, rather than without you to enjoy a safety that involved no danger.‚ÄùDemosthenes Against Leptines 20.52‚Äì20.53 These conflicts further weakened the city-states of the Peloponnese and set the stage for the conquests of Philip II of Macedon. Demosthenes warned that Philip's military force exceeded that of Athens and thus they must develop a tactical advantage. He noted the importance of a citizen army as opposed to a mercenary force, citing the mercenaries of Corinth who fought alongside citizens and defeated the Spartans.Philippic I, Book 4.24 In 338 BC, after having defeated Athens and its allies, Philip II created the League of Corinth to unite Greece (included Corinth and Macedonia) in the war against Persia. Philip was named hegemon of the League. In the spring of 337 BC, the Second congress of Corinth established the Common Peace. =Hellenistic period= By 332 BC, Alexander the Great was in control of Greece, as hegemon. During the Hellenistic period, Corinth, like many other Greece cities, never quite had autonomy. Under the successors of Alexander the Great, Greece was contested ground, and Corinth was occasionally the battleground for contests between the Antigonids, based in Macedonia, and other Hellenistic powers. In 308 BC, the city was captured from the Antigonids by Ptolemy I, who claimed to come as a liberator of Greece from the Antigonids. However, the city was recaptured by Demetrius in 304 BC.Shipley, G. 2000. The Greek World After Alexander 323‚Äì30 BC. London: Routledge (pp. 121‚Äì122). Corinth remained under Antigonid control for half a century. After 280 BC, it was ruled by the faithful governor Craterus; but, in 253/2 BC, his son Alexander of Corinth, moved by Ptolemaic subsidies, resolved to challenge the Macedonian supremacy and seek independence as a tyrant. He was probably poisoned in 247 BC; after his death, the Macedonian king Antigonus II Gonatas retook the city in the winter of 245/44 BC. The Macedonian rule was short-lived. In 243 BC, Aratus of Sicyon, using a surprise attack, captured the fortress of Acrocorinth and convinced the citizenship to join the Achaean League. Thanks to an alliance agreement with Aratus, the Macedonians recovered Corinth once again in 224 BC; but, after the Roman intervention in 197 BC, the city was permanently brought into the Achaean League. Under the leadership of Philopoemen, the Achaeans went on to take control of the entire Peloponnesus and made Corinth the capital of their confederation.Shipley, G. 2000. The Greek World After Alexander 323‚Äì30 BC. London: Routledge (pp. 137‚Äì138). =Roman era= Scene of the Battle of Corinth (146 BC): last day before the Roman legions looted and burned the Greek city of Corinth. The last day on Corinth, Tony Robert-Fleury, 1870 Ancient Roman statue in the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth. In 146 BC, Rome declared war on the Achaean League and, after victories over league forces in the summer of that year, the Romans under Lucius Mummius besieged and captured Corinth. When he entered the city, Mummius killed all the men and sold the women and children into slavery before burning the city, for which he was given the cognomen Achaicus as the conqueror of the Achaean League.Shipley, G. 2000. The Greek World After Alexander 323‚Äì30 BC. London: Routledge (pp. 384‚Äì385). There is archeological evidence of some minimal habitation in the years afterwards, but Corinth remained largely deserted until Julius Caesar refounded the city as Colonia Laus Iulia Corinthiensis (‚Äòcolony of Corinth in honour of Julius‚Äô) in 44 BC, shortly before his assassination. At this time, an amphitheatre was built. ( ) Under the Romans, Corinth was rebuilt as a major city in Southern Greece or Achaia. It had a largeJosiah Russell, in \\"Late Ancient and Medieval Population\\", estimates 50,000 people in Roman Corinth. mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews. The city was an important locus for activities of the imperial cult, and both Temple E and the Julian Basilica have been suggested as locations of imperial cult activity. Biblical Corinth Pirene fountain Corinth is mentioned many times in the New Testament, largely in connection with Paul the Apostle's mission there, testifying to the success of Caesar's refounding of the city. Traditionally, the Church of Corinth is believed to have been founded by Paul, making it an Apostolic See. The apostle Paul first visited the city in AD 49 or 50, when Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul of Achaia. Paul resided here for eighteen months (see ). Here he first became acquainted with Priscilla and Aquila with whom he later traveled. They worked here together as tentmakers (from which is derived the modern Christian concept of tentmaking), and regularly attended the synagogue. In AD 51/52, Gallio presided over the trial of the Apostle Paul in Corinth. This event provides a secure date for the book of the Acts of the Apostles within the Bible. Silas and Timothy rejoined Paul here, having last seen him in Berea (). suggests that Jewish refusal to accept his preaching here led Paul to resolve no longer to speak in the synagogues where he travelled: 'From now on I will go to the Gentiles'.Paul and Barnabas had said the same thing to the Jews of Antioch in Acts 13:46 However, on his arrival in Ephesus (), the narrative records that Paul went to the synagogue to preach. Paul wrote at least two epistles to the Christian church, the First Epistle to the Corinthians (written from Ephesus) and the Second Epistle to the Corinthians (written from Macedonia). The first Epistle occasionally reflects the conflict between the thriving Christian church and the surrounding community. Some scholars believe that Paul visited Corinth for an intermediate \\"painful visit\\" (see ) between the first and second epistles. After writing the second epistle, he stayed in Corinth for about three months in the late winter, and there wrote his Epistle to the Romans. Based on clues within the Corinthian epistles themselves, some scholars have concluded that Paul wrote possibly as many as four epistles to the church at Corinth.Orr, William F. and James Arthur Walther (1976). 1 Corinthians: A New Translation (Anchor Bible). Doubleday, p. 120. Only two are contained within the Christian canon (First and Second Epistles to the Corinthians); the other two letters are lost. (The lost letters would probably represent the very first letter that Paul wrote to the Corinthians and the third one, and so the First and Second Letters of the canon would be the second and the fourth if four were written.) Many scholars think that the third one (known as the \\"letter of the tears\\"; see 2 Cor 2:4) is included inside the canonical Second Epistle to the Corinthians (it would be chapters 10‚Äì13). This letter is not to be confused with the so-called \\"Third Epistle to the Corinthians\\", which is a pseudepigraphical letter written many years after the death of Paul. There are speculations from Bruce Winter that the Jewish access to their own food in Corinth was disallowed after Paul's departure. By this theory, Paul had instructed Christian Gentiles to maintain Jewish access to food according to their dietary laws. This speculation is contested by Rudolph who argues that there is no evidence to support this theory. He instead argues that Paul had desired the Gentile Christians to remain assimilated within their Gentile communities and not adopt Jewish dietary procedures. =Byzantine era= The walled gates of Acrocorinth. The city was largely destroyed in the earthquakes of AD 365 and AD 375, followed by Alaric's invasion in 396. The city was rebuilt after these disasters on a monumental scale, but covered a much smaller area than previously. Four churches were located in the city proper, another on the citadel of the Acrocorinth, and a monumental basilica at the port of Lechaion. During the reign of Emperor Justinian I (527‚Äì565), a large stone wall was erected from the Saronic to the Corinthian gulfs, protecting the city and the Peloponnese peninsula from the barbarian invasions from the north. The stone wall was about six miles (10 km) long and was named Hexamilion (\\"six-miles\\"). Corinth declined from the 6th century on, and may even have fallen to barbarian invaders in the early 7th century. The main settlement moved from the lower city to the Acrocorinth. Despite its becoming the capital of the theme of Hellas and, after c. 800, of the theme of the Peloponnese, it was not until the 9th century that the city began to recover, reaching its apogee in the 11th and 12th centuries, when it was the site of a flourishing silk industry. In November 856, an earthquake in Corinth killed an estimated 45,000. The wealth of the city attracted the attention of the Italo-Normans under Roger of Sicily, who plundered it in 1147, carrying off many captives, most notably silk weavers. The city never fully recovered from the Norman sack. =Principality of Achaea= Following the sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, a group of Crusaders under the French knights William of Champlitte and Geoffrey of Villehardouin carried out the conquest of the Peloponnese. The Corinthians resisted the Frankish conquest from their stronghold in Acrocorinth, under the command of Leo Sgouros, from 1205 until 1210. In 1208 Leo Sgouros killed himself by riding off the top of Acrocorinth, but resistance continued for two more years. Finally, in 1210 the fortress fell to the Crusaders, and Corinth became a full part of the Principality of Achaea, governed by the Villehardouins from their capital in Andravida in Elis. Corinth was the last significant town of Achaea on its northern borders with another crusader state, the Duchy of Athens. The Ottomans captured the city in 1395. The Byzantines of the Despotate of the Morea recaptured it in 1403, and the Despot Theodore II Palaiologos, restored the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth in 1415. =Ottoman rule= In 1458, five years after the final Fall of Constantinople, the Turks of the Ottoman Empire conquered the city and its mighty castle. The Ottomans renamed it G√∂rdes and made it a sanjak (district) centre within the Rumelia Eyalet. The Venetians captured the city in 1687 during the Morean War, and it remained under Venetian control until the Ottomans retook the city in 1715. Corinth was the capital of the Mora Eyalet in 1715‚Äì1731 and then again a sanjak capital until 1821. =Independence= \\"Corinth with Acrocorinth\\" by Carl Anton Joseph Rottmann, 1847 During the Greek War of Independence, 1821‚Äì1830 the city was destroyed by the Ottoman forces. The city was officially liberated in 1832 after the Treaty of London. In 1833, the site was considered among the candidates for the new capital city of the recently founded Kingdom of Greece, due to its historical significance and strategic position. Nafplio was chosen initially, then Athens. Modern Corinth In 1858, the village surrounding the ruins of Ancient Corinth was destroyed by an earthquake, leading to the establishment of New Corinth NE of the ancient city. Ancient city and its environs =Acrocorinth, the acropolis= Acrocorinthis, the acropolis of ancient Corinth, is a monolithic rock that was continuously occupied from archaic times to the early 19th century. The city's archaic acropolis, already an easily defensible position due to its geomorphology, was further heavily fortified during the Byzantine Empire as it became the seat of the strategos of the Thema of Hellas. Later it was a fortress of the Franks after the Fourth Crusade, the Venetians and the Ottoman Turks. With its secure water supply, Acrocorinth's fortress was used as the last line of defense in southern Greece because it commanded the isthmus of Corinth, repelling foes from entry into the Peloponnesian peninsula. Three circuit walls formed the man-made defense of the hill. The highest peak on the site was home to a temple to Aphrodite which was Christianized as a church, and then became a mosque. The American School began excavations on it in 1929. Currently, Acrocorinth is one of the most important medieval castle sites of Greece. =Two ports: Lechaeum and Cenchreae= Corinth had two harbours: Lechaeum on the Corinthian Gulf and Cenchreae on the Saronic Gulf. Lechaeum was the principal port, connected to the city with a set of long walls of about length, and was the main trading station for Italy and Sicily, where there were many Corinthian colonies, while Cenchreae served the commerce with the Eastern Mediterranean. Ships could be transported between the two harbours by means of the diolkos constructed by the tyrant Periander.

History =World War I ‚Äì Battles at Vermandovillers= The first attack occurred on September 24, 1914, it was partially blocked by the 75th Infantry Regiment at Etoil√© woods near to Herleville. The front was stabilized for two years until September 1916. The spearhead attack of September 4, 1916 at edge of Vermandovillers‚Äô Etoil√© woods, was assigned to the 132nd Division(10th Army), against heavily concreted machine guns bunkers, organized by the Germans for nearly 2 years (Report No.: 6288/3 of September 26, 1916 of the 132nd Division). The position was defended by the 11th Division (German Empire), specifically the 21. Infanterie-Brigade and Infanterie-Regiment 51. On 6 September 1916, many (the 13th, the 43rd, the 51st and 120th) Infantry Regiments were involved in the so-called battle of Vermandovillers. It ended on September 9, 1916 for lack of troops. The 158th, the 366th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion Chasseurs showed exemplary conduct and suffered heavy losses. For the record, between September 4‚Äì9, 1916, the 86th Brigade lost 1,071 men, 264th Brigade lost 1,513 and 108th Brigade 1,580. These figures explain the fact that in a radius around Vermandovillers, there are, buried in military cemeteries, including 1,261 French soldiers. 22,632 German soldiers lie in the Vermandovillers German war cemetery, including the writers Reinhard Johannes Sorge and Alfred Lichtenstein (writer).

It is a low lying, densely branched shrub, commonly up to , but exceptionally to beyond . The branches are spiny in form but not sharp nor firm at the tips. The leaves are grey-green to greenish, finely-haired, narrow and only one half to three quarters of an inch long. The color of the plant and branches is grayish-green to gray, or whitish-gray, to dull browns or tinged with red. The flowers are often sparse and sometimes inconspicuous, but plants in some locales can bloom prolifically in red flowers.

The commune also includes the hamlet of Sainte-Emilie. Population History According to Abbot Decagny of Roisel, Villers- Faucon was originally Villers-Falcon and previously Villare Falconis, which means, in Latin, villa of the hawks. Villers-Faucon's original purpose was that of a falconry, located in the heart of the forest of Arrouaise. The village was almost totally destroyed in 1916, during the First World War. Following a withdrawal of German troops around the Hindenburg line, the inhabitants were evacuated to the north to Denain, tons of dynamite were set off around all of the buildings in the town (including the sugar refinery at St. Emilie) and all the trees were cut down, to leave the field open for the approach of troops. The village was destroyed, but the cemetery was left untouched. After the conflict, reconstruction began, which lasted almost a decade, led by a rebuilding cooperative led by Louis Faille. Sites and monuments * Notre Dame church was rebuilt in 1932 by architect Louis Faille. It's one of many public buildings completed by the architect in his work during the period of reconstruction of the eastern part of the Somme.

In accordance with the Army's request, Professor T. Miki, Osaka Imperial University designed and Kobe Seikojo built the Te-G≈ç. No \\"Ki\\" code number was assigned there to since the project was outside the jurisdiction of the Army Aviation Headquarters. This aircraft was one of two competitors for an Imperial Japanese Army STOL liaison and observation aircraft. Inspired by the Fieseler Storch Prof. Tetsuo Miki of Osaka University designed this aircraft. Although the aircraft was similar to the Storch, it was not by any means a copy. Using construction methods common at that time, the wing were made of a wood spar and ribs, covered with fabric/plywood. Automatic slots along the length of the leading edges, large Fowler-type flaps were installed along the trailing edges, and the ailerons were also used as flaps for very short take off. The fuselage had a steel tube frame that was fabric-covered from the cockpit back and the nose was covered with sheet metal. The tail components had the same structure as the wings.

It has a native distribution incorporating much of Africa (including Madagascar), and the south-west and south of Asia, and it has become adventitious in northern Australia. Description Aerva javanica (Burm.f.) Schult. in the Pilbara, Western Australia The plant is herbaceous, multi-stemmed and soft-wooded and bears broad leaves; it often has an erect habit and grows to a height of about . In Western Australia it tends to grow in sandy soils especially along drainage lines. It flowers between January and October. Diplospory, a type of Agamospermy, occurs during the development of female gametophyte in the ovule and hence reduction division does not take place in the Megaspore mother cell. The diploid egg is unfertilized and forms the embryo. Hence daughter plants are exactly clones of the mother. The species uses carbon fixation. Uses This herb is deep rooted, and is used as soil binder in desert reclamation.L R Burdak (1982): Recent advances in desert afforestation, Dehradun, p. 66 It is used for fuel and for fodder for goats. In traditional medicine the seeds are believed to cure headaches. A gargle is made from the plant to try to treat toothache. The plant has naturalised in northern regions of Australia, as an alien introduction, and is cultivated and utilised by the indigenous peoples. The thick, white inflorescences have traditionally been harvested in Arabia for stuffing cushions and saddle pads.M.A. Zahran & A.J.

The band consists of Robin Pecknold (vocals, guitar), Skyler Skjelset (guitar, mandolin, backing vocals), Casey Wescott (keyboards, mandolin, backing vocals), Christian Wargo (bass, guitar, backing vocals) and Morgan Henderson (upright bass, guitar, woodwinds, violin, percussion, saxophone). Led by singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold, the band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of their second EP Sun Giant and their debut album Fleet Foxes on Sub Pop. Both received critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album Helplessness Blues was released on Sub Pop in 2011. Following a hiatus between 2013 and 2016, during which Pecknold pursued an undergraduate degree, Fleet Foxes reunited to record their third album, Crack-Up, released on Nonesuch Records in 2017. The band's fourth album, Shore, was released on Anti- in September 2020. History =Formation and early years (2005‚Äì06)= Robin Pecknold and Skyler Skjelset both attended Lake Washington High School in Kirkland, a suburb of Seattle, and soon became close friends. Pecknold and Skjelset bonded over an appreciation of Bob Dylan and Neil Young and began making music together. Their parents influenced their musical tastes early on--Skjelset's mother Peggi was a keen listener to both Dylan and Hank Williams while Pecknold's father Greg was a member of The Fathoms, a local 1960s soul group. The two shared an interest in the music of Dylan and Brian Wilson. Pecknold played bass for Seattle's Dolour on a US tour in 2005, shortly before forming the first incarnation of Fleet Foxes. Originally going by the name \\"The Pineapples\\", a name clash with another local band prompted a change and Pecknold decided upon \\"Fleet Foxes\\", suggesting that it was \\"evocative of some weird English activity like fox hunting\\". Pecknold took up the role of principal songwriter, both singing and playing guitar, while Skjelset played lead guitar.\\"Fleet Foxes Expand Seattle Sound\\", Seattle magazine The original lineup was filled out by Casey Wescott on keyboards and backing vocals, Bryn Lumsden on bass and Nicholas Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Pecknold's late-sixties pop style caught the attention of the Seattle producer Phil Ek and he helped them record their first demo in 2006, the self-released Fleet Foxes EP. Ek was impressed with the band's songwriting, and on hearing Pecknold for the first time, noted, \\"It was obvious he had talent coming out of his ass.\\" By late 2006 the Seattle press began to take notice of the band; Tom Scanlon of the Seattle Times stated that he was impressed with the band's lyrics and musical maturity. By the end of the year, Lumsden had been replaced on bass by Craig Curran, who would also handle many of the band's vocal harmonies. With growing popularity on the local circuit, the band set about making their first album in early 2007, spending time in the studio with producer Ek in addition to recording material at home. However, funds for recording were tight, so the band members cobbled together what funds they had, which limited the time they had in the studio, and so the majority of the tracks were recorded in various band members' apartments, other spaces, or the basement of Pecknold's parents' house. =Sun Giant and Fleet Foxes (2007‚Äì08)= Fleet Foxes performing in Copenhagen, 2008. Fleet Foxes were becoming increasingly popular and by late 2007, they had attracted over a quarter of a million song plays over two months on their Myspace site. Although the band had not released any of their recordings, they benefited from word of mouth exposure and their success soon translated into a record deal, signing with Warner Music subsidiary record label Sub Pop on January 18, 2008. According to Sub Pop's A&R;, Sue Busch, at the time of signing the band was still a relatively primitive set-up, being without manager or legal representation. Robin's sister Aja Pecknold then assumed the role of band manager.\\"Interview With Fleet Foxes A&R; Sue Busch\\", HitQuarters, May 4, 2009. The band's frontman, Robin Pecknold, attributes much of their success and popularity to illegal file sharing. The band tracked their second EP, Sun Giant, at Bear Creek Studio and performed overdubs and mixed at Seattle's Avast! Recording Co., around the same time in preparation for upcoming tours. Fleet Foxes began their spring tour with another Northwest band Blitzen Trapper on February 28, 2008. Before the recording of the EP, bassist Curran was replaced by Christian Wargo, whose voice, like that of his predecessor, would become an important part of the band's harmony blend. The band's performances, first at the SXSW festival in March 2008, and then the Sasquatch! festival in May 2008, moved the band into the public consciousness, notably attracting attention from the European press for the first time. Sun Giant was released internationally on April 8, 2008 and the group's brand of folk, rock and pop, marked by their use of vocal harmonies, was well received by the press. Despite the warm critical reception, the group said that the EP did not represent their full ambitions, serving merely as a CD to sell while on tour. In May 2008, the band chose to extend their North American and European tour until September in support of their forthcoming album. At this time Josh Tillman replaced Peterson on drums and backing vocals. Their first full-length album, Fleet Foxes, was released shortly afterwards on June 3, 2008. The album achieved similar critical success as the previous EP. Fleet Foxes received four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which compared it to the likes of the Beach Boys, Animal Collective, and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and a 9.0 out of 10 in a review by Pitchfork Media, sharing the website's album of the year rank with the Sun Giant EP. The Guardian was particularly complimentary, awarding the album five stars and declaring it \\"a landmark in American music ‚Äî an instant classic\\". On June 24, 2008, Fleet Foxes went to No. 1 on the CMJ Radio 200 Chart. The album achieved an average rating of 87/100 from 30 critic reviews on the aggregator website Metacritic. While the group enjoyed moderate success in the United States, Fleet Foxes was better received in Europe, selling over 200,000 copies in the five months following its release. The sales were matched with critical plaudits and their debut album won Uncut's first ever Music Award 2008 prize. Uncut's editor, Allan Jones, said the album \\"showed impeccable musicianship, and although you could trace its antecedents, it sounded totally unique. Fleet Foxes was just a glorious debut.\\" The band sold out music venues for their tours of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their growing popularity.Sauma, Luiza (December 7, 2008). \\"Fleet Foxes: Are a hairy bunch of young folk-rockers inventing a new sound of Seattle?\\", The Independent. Retrieved on January 19, 2009. At the end of 2008, Fleet Foxes was rated album of the year by Billboard's Critic's Choice and in Metacritic's end of year best album round-up it appeared in 17 lists, topping six of them. Furthermore, it had sold over 408,000 copies in North America and over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, making it the first gold certificate record for UK label Bella Union.Paine, Andre (December 23, 2008). \\"Fleet Foxes Go Gold In United Kingdom\\". Billboard. Retrieved on January 29, 2009. Their growing profile enabled the band to make televised appearances, playing on Vincent Moon's La Blogotheque in December 2008 and on Saturday Night Live the following January. In 2009, they toured in Europe to favorable reviews; the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said their show in Paradiso induced goosebumps. In 2008 and 2009, the band played globally ending the tour in September with a final European leg. =Helplessness Blues (2009‚Äì12)= 2009 Coachella Festival. Pecknold said that he would have liked the album to be released in 2009; however, the band's touring schedule delayed rehearsals of the new songs until February 2009. These sessions took place in a rented house outside Seattle, but were mostly scrapped, losing the band $60,000 of their own money. Further delays ensued because the drummer, Tillman, was scheduled to play a solo tour in Europe and North America throughout the 2009‚Äì10 winter. Pecknold later sent some demos to producer Phil Ek and expressed the hope that the second LP would emerge in late 2010. In December 2009, Pecknold said he wanted the new LP to sound \\"less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based\\". He referenced the 12-string guitar sound from Roy Harper's folk album Stormcock, saying, \\"That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record.\\" He wanted the band to record very quickly, with \\"vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best- sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling.\\" The band eventually began recording in April 2010 in various locations (including West Hurley, New York) under the label Reciprocal Recording and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band many of the initial vocals were done in one take). The album features a new six-piece band line up, with the addition of the former Blood Brothers bassist Morgan Henderson on upright bass and woodwind instruments.Hay, Travis \\"Fleet Foxes add a Blood Brother for sixth member\\" Guerilla Candy, April 17, 2011 The album, Helplessness Blues, was released on May 3, 2011 with a cover illustrated by the Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by Christopher Alderson. The title track was released via free download on January 31, 2011, and the album's fourth track, \\"Battery Kinzie\\", was premiered in the UK on Zane Lowe's radio show on March 22, 2011. The Sub Pop record label released a downloadable music video of the track \\"Grown Ocean\\", with footage of the album's recording, on its website in support of the album. A 12\\" vinyl double A-side single of \\"Helplessness Blues\\" and \\"Grown Ocean\\" was released for Record Store Day on April 16, 2011. On November 1, 2011, Pecknold's brother, Sean Pecknold, released the official music video for \\"The Shrine / An Argument\\". Helplessness Blues was nominated as Best Folk Album at the 2012 Grammy Awards, held February 12, 2012. =Departure of Tillman and hiatus (2012‚Äì2016)= On January 18, 2012, after the band had finished touring for the album, drummer Tillman announced that he had left the band.Pelly, Jenn \\"J. Tillman Leaves Fleet Foxes, Other Members Form New Band Poor Moon\\" Pitchfork, January 19, 2012 He would go on to reinvent himself and record several albums as Father John Misty, notable for his ironic sense of humor in lyrics and media as well as often criticizing both the record industry and society in interviews and on stage. In October 2020, Pecknold reflected on Tillman's departure during a Reddit AMA: \\"[Josh] \\"quit\\" the band after recording drums for Helplessness, got into narcotics and made his first Father John Misty album while I was making Helplessness in Seattle. Then Sub Pop offered to put out his album, but only if he delayed it for a year or so and toured Helplessness with us. Which we all weakly agreed to going through with, but it quickly became obvious he'd rather have just been doing that project instead, and I would have rathered that as well. So that tour I had to endure being around a lot of substance abuse, sabotaged shows, just general ill treatment, shit-talking, all while paying him for songs he didn't have anything to do with. It sucked!\\" On June 15, 2013, an image of a home recording set- up‚Äìincluding a laptop computer, microphone and guitar‚Äìwas posted on the Fleet Foxes Facebook page with the caption \\"Step one\\". On June 16, 2013, an image of a broken mandolin with the caption \\"Step two\\" was posted. These images were later deleted, but led to speculation that the group was working on a new project, possibly a third studio album. On April 23, 2014, Robin Pecknold posted to the band's Facebook page that he had moved to New York to get his undergraduate degree at the Columbia University School of General Studies, a liberal arts college of Columbia University in New York City. =Crack-Up (2016‚Äì2018)= On May 18, 2016, while answering fan questions on his Instagram account, Pecknold confirmed that Fleet Foxes were working on new material with drummer and frequent collaborator Neal Morgan, best known for his work with Joanna Newsom and Bill Callahan. Describing Morgan as a \\"full Fox\\", Pecknold also admitted he \\"had to up my songwriting game for homeboy.\\" However, when Pecknold posted a photo of the band minus Morgan on Instagram, he clarified that Morgan was one of three drummers involved in the new album, and that for the time being Fleet Foxes would consist of Pecknold, Skjelset, Wescott, Wargo, and Henderson as a \\"five-piece 'core band'\\", but they would still use a drummer for live performances and additional musicians for certain shows. Pecknold also said that the new material would be \\"a different vibe\\" compared to Fleet Foxes' previous output. On November 14, 2016, the band confirmed (via their Facebook account) that their new album was nearly complete. On December 25, 2016, Pecknold posted a photo on his Instagram account which showed four albums in the Fleet Foxes' queue in his iTunes library: the first studio album Fleet Foxes; the Sun Giant EP; the second studio album Helplessness Blues; and an unknown third album entitled Ylajali. This led to speculation that the band's third album would: 1) be named after a character from Knut Hamsun's novel Hunger; 2) contain a photo from Japanese photographer Hiroshi Hamaya as the cover art; and 3) be released through Nonesuch Records, since the label's logo can be seen on the album cover. In an email newsletter on January 1, 2017, production company Mason Jar Music confirmed that Fleet Foxes was working on a new album, since they contributed to the production. The album was called Crack-Up, after an F. Scott Fitzgerald essay of the same name. The album is a concept album and was recorded at Electric Lady Studios and Sear Sound in New York City. On March 7, 2017, Fleet Foxes announced their third studio album, Crack-Up, released on June 16, 2017 via Nonesuch Records, a new label for the band. The lead single, \\"Third of May / ≈ådaigahara\\", was released the same day. On April 4, 2017, the band posted the album trailer for the new album on YouTube. The trailer briefly presents various songs from the album and shows some images while they were recording them. The video was made by Sean Pecknold, Robin's brother. On May 15, 2017, Fleet Foxes made their live return at the Wilma Theatre in Missoula, in which they performed nine songs from Crack-Up along with a selection of older material and a cover of \\"In the Morning\\" by Bee Gees. The band's current live line-up includes Matt Barrick of The Walkmen, who is also the most heavily featured of the three guest drummers who contributed to Crack-Up. Barrick has continued to play with the band, but has not become an official member. The new album also included the sounds of a brass quartet called The Westerlies. On October 10, 2017, the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled The Electric Lady Session, for Black Friday Record Store Day 2017. The EP was released on November 24 of that year, and is a collection of live performances of four songs from Crack-Up, originally recorded for their session at Fordham University‚Äôs radio station WFUV. For Record Store Day 2018, the band released another EP, entitled \\"Crack Up (Choral Version)\\"/\\"In The Morning (Live in Switzerland)\\", in collaboration with the Icelandic female choir, Graduale Nobili. =Shore (2019‚Äìpresent)= On December 31, 2018, Pecknold teased several new demos online for an upcoming new album. The album was announced in September 2020; titled Shore, it was released on September 22.

Warlus is situated 16 miles(26 km) west of Amiens, on the D18 road. One place of interest in Walrus is the sixteenth-century church of Saint-Apre. Population History The name of Warlus may have its origins in the name of an early bishop. Other sources say it comes from the Anglo-Saxon war(store or watch) and lux (light). In the 12th century, there was once a high tower which may have been used as a beacon during wartime. There is nothing to suggest that Warlus is very old. It doesn't appear to have had a castle and seems to have grown around a former convent, of which few vestiges remain (a few walls and some underground passages). The priors came from the Abbey of Selaincourt. In the 12th century, the population grouped around the monastery and build a church. In the 16th & 17th centuries the seigneurs came from the Crequy family of Poix-de-Picardie. During the Hundred Years War, the English went through the territory (there's an 'English path' in Warlus woods) from Poix-de-Picardie to Airaines.

The company's first vehicle was the REVAi electric car, available in 26 countries with more than 4,000 of its different versions sold worldwide by mid March 2011. Reva was acquired by Indian conglomerate Mahindra & Mahindra in May 2010. After the acquisition, the company launched the electric hatchback e2o in 2013. Today, the company sells electric vehicles in different segments ‚Äì the electric sedan eVerito, the electric commercial vehicle eSupro (passenger and cargo) and the Treo range of low maintenance, lithium-ion battery powered three-wheelers. Recently, Mahindra Electric became the first Indian car manufacturer to cross 170 million eKilometres traveled on its fleet. History The Reva Electric Car Company (RECC) was founded in 1994 by Chetan Maini, as a joint venture between the Maini Group of Bangalore and Amerigon Electric Vehicle Technologies (AEVT Inc.) of the USA. The company's sole aim was to develop and produce an affordable compact electric car. Several other automakers were also aiming to do so, but in 2001 RECC launched the REVA.

Two REVAis and a Mahindra e2o at a Mahindra REVA dealership in Kathmandu, Nepal. RECC joined up with several automotive experts to develop components for REVA. Curtis Instruments, Inc. of USA developed a Motor Controller specifically for the car. The car had a power pack for which Tudor India Limited supplied customized Prestolite batteries. The Charger for Reva was developed by Modular Power Systems of USA (a division of TDI Power). Later, RECC started manufacturing the charger themselves through a technical collaboration agreement between MPS and the Maini Group. In 2004 GoinGreen of the UK entered into an agreement with RECC to import REVA cars and market them under the G-Wiz moniker. In 2008 a revamped REVA model was launched called the REVAi. The company started production of a Lithium-ion variant called the REVA L-ion in 2009. In 2009 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, Reva presented its future models Reva NXR and Reva NXG. During the event Reva and General Motors India declared a technical collaboration to develop affordable EV for the Indian market. As a result of this General Motors India announced an electric version of their hatchback in the New Delhi Auto Expo 2010: named the e-Spark, Reva was to provide battery technology. On 26 May 2010, India's largest sports utility vehicles and tractor maker Mahindra & Mahindra bought a 55.2% controlling stake in Reva. Following the deal, the company was renamed Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles Private Limited. Mahindra's president of automotive business, Pawan Goenka, became the new company's chairman. As a result of the ownership change General Motors pulled out of the tie-up with Reva that was to produce the e-spark. In Feb 2011 GoinGreen, the UK's exclusive importer of the G-Wiz, announced that it was no longer stocking the model (although it would order them on a 4-6-week lead time when requested by customers). In 2016, the company was rebranded as Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd.

Serenade is credited as being George Balanchine‚Äôs first full-length ballet in America. Using the students of his newly formed School of American Ballet, Balanchine choreographed this ballet for an American audience that had not been widely exposed to ballet before Bird, \\"Principles of Choreography as Exemplified in the Works of George Balanchine\\" (1980). Master's Theses. 1851 . Students of the School of American Ballet gave the first performance on Sunday, 10 June 1934 on the Felix M. Warburg estate in White Plains, N.Y., where Mozartiana had been danced the previous day. It was then presented by the Producing Company of the School of American Ballet on 6 December at the Avery Memorial Theatre of the Wadsworth Atheneum with sets by the painter William Littlefield. Balanchine presented the ballet as his response to the generous sponsorships he received during his immigration to America. The official premiere took place on 1 March 1935 with the American Ballet at the Adelphi Theatre, New York, conducted by Sandor Harmati. NYCB principal dancer Philip Neal chose to include Serenade in his farewell performance on Sunday, 13 June 2010. The blue tutus used in Serenade inspired the naming of the Balanchine crater on the planet Mercury. Analysis The work can be considered a bridge between his two early works for Sergei Diaghilev and his later, less episodic American works. The dance is characterized by two falls, a choreographic allusion to Giselle, but also an element in the Khorumi, a Georgian folk dance which influenced Balanchine. While Serenade is one of Balanchine‚Äôs infamous plotless ballets, many elements of the dance seem to point towards a loose form of a story. As dancers came and went during the rehearsal process, Balanchine choreographed their entrances and exits into the piece. At the beginning of rehearsals, Balanchine started with seventeen young women, reflected in the opening scene of the ballet. The next rehearsal there were only nine women present and then six, so he choreographed the following scenes with those numbers of dancers. Male students began to attend the rehearsals and so they were choreographed in, and the late arrival of one woman was also includedSteichen, James. ‚ÄúThe Stories of Serenade: Nonprofit History and George Balanchine‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Ballet in America.‚Äù‚Äù Princeton University Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies: Working Paper Series, 2012 . While plotless, Serenade reflected the ups and downs of choreographing a ballet, and made the humanity of the dancers clear when he choreographed their real-life mistakes into the finished product. By achieving this, Balanchine made the ballet very student-friendly: according to City Ballet‚Äôs Robert Gottlieb, the ballet was formed in such a way ‚Äúin order to have something to teach the students with‚Äîsomething they could handle yet would stretch their abilities,‚Äù Steichen, James. ‚ÄúThe Stories of Serenade: Nonprofit History and George Balanchine‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Ballet in America.‚Äù‚Äù Princeton University Center for Arts and Cultural Policy Studies: Working Paper Series, 2012 .

Starting with a simple gesture phrase, the ballet then explores everything from complex formations to technical elements of partnering in the ‚ÄúWaltzing Girl‚Äù, for example. Thus the ballet acted as an important teaching tool that students of all advanced levels could potentially participate in and work up to as a graduation exercise. Choreographed to a sweeping Tchaikovsky score and with nods to traditional ballets such as Giselle and Swan Lake, Balanchine also created an atmosphere or yearning and romanticism, aided by the soft blue tutus of the women and dimmed lighting,Adler, R. (1998). Serenade. In The International Encyclopedia of Dance. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 19 Oct. 2020 . While the piece was first choreographed with students in mind, the American Ballet Theatre is the first ballet company credited with performing it. Starting in 1935 the company performed Serenade, first for two weeks in New York City and then moving on with a fourteen-week tour of the United States. While their early performances were not highly successful, many interpreted this ‚Äúlack of enthusiasm as an indication of the company‚Äôs immaturity,‚Äù Bird, \\"Principles of Choreography as Exemplified in the Works of George Balanchine\\" (1980).

Querrieu and surroundings on a Cassini map Valley of the river Hallue, between Querrieu and Bussy-l√®s-Daours History =Henri IV battle= After Amiens was invaded and taken by Spanish Netherlanders on 11 March 1597, Henri IV besieged the town with a considerable army. On 29 August he was notified of the approach of a significant Spanish force (four companies of arquebuse-men and 300 mounted soldiers), protecting a supplies convoy. The King sallied from his camp north of Amiens, accompanied by Biron, de Lagrange-Montigny, the count of Auvergne, and headed toward the enemy train. Leading an escort of 50 soldiers, he spotted Spanish scouts emerging from the Querrieu forest. He charged them at full gallop, with his escorts close behind. The startled Spanish group assumed they were being attacked by a large force, and beat a hasty retreat. The King pursued his adversaries, who abandoned two sous- lieutenants, 200 horsemen and numerous prisoners.Baron Alberic de Calonne : Histoire de la ville d'Amiens.

On 16 December the French Northern Army, led by General Faidherbe, took a position on the hills bordering the left side of the river Hallue. Skirmish on Querrieu General Manteuffel took command of the Prussian Army on 20 December, and that same day launched a troop and a battalion, about two thousand men, toward Querrieu. On the eastern skirts of the wood, two kilometres in front of the village, they encountered French outposts and engaged in battle. Three companies of French Line infantry,Line infantry coming from Bussy-l√®s-Daours, counter-attacked the right flank of the Prussian force, which retreated to Amiens. In this confrontation the Prussian losses were 3 officers and 69 men killed or wounded; the French losses were 7 killed and 20 wounded.

By midmorning the Prussians had possession of the wood and the village of Querrieu. Prussian field batteries on the heights of the village along the main road, fired on French positions at Pont-Noyelles. The French guns responded, and several shells hit houses in Querrieu. In the afternoon, forty-two Prussian guns are in battery between Querrieu and Bussy-l√®s-Daours. At about 3:30 p.m. the Prussians launch a mass attack. They make headway into Pont-Noyelles but are stopped at the eastern border of the village. A counter- attack push them back into Querrieu where they establish their bivouac for the night. During this night, the French Northern Army start off a movement towards Albert and Bapaume. In the communal cemetery of Querrieu, mortal remains of French and Prussian soldiers were gathered in two collective graves.

On 1 July 1916, General Haig, commander of the British Forces in France, is poised to attack. After a heavy artillery barrage the British troops advance from their trenches toward the German line. However, the barrage failed to destroy the distant German artillery, which then opened return fire on the advancing troops. Thus began the British infantry's most murderous battle of the war.The battles of the Somme, 1916 During that summer several notables came through the area, including General Foch, and Arthur Balfour, former British Prime minister. On 10 August the entire Headquarters staff gathered around British King George V, who presented decorations to French Generals Fayolle and Balfourier. The Sovereign was accompanied by his son, the young Prince of Wales, future king Edward VIII, then Duke of Windsor after less than a year of reign.

After a few days, their advance began to falter. Fresh British and Australian units were moved to the vital rail center of Amiens. Numerous British units were stationed in and around Querrieu, in a military concentration area. On 31 May On May 31, General John Monash assumed command of the Australian Corps and set his Headquarters in the castle of Saint-Gratien, four kilometres north of Querrieu. Charles Bean with files in 1935 In May 1918, in the lower part of the village, the living space of a brewery near the Hallue river was occupied by several Australian war correspondents, among them Charles W. W. Bean, who would write the \\"Official History of Australia in the war 1914‚Äì1918\\". Outbuildings on the grounds were occupied by a company of the 21st Australian infantry battalion, who take the name of \\"Querrieu brewery company\\". One of the war correspondents (C. W. W. Bean himself ?) described the events taking place during a day for all men of the company. (Full text in: Official History of Australia in the war 1914‚Äì1918, volume VI, chapter I, pp. 8‚Äì18History of Australia in the war 1914-1918) On 4 July General Monash launched a combined attack of artillery, tanks, infantry and air forces toward Le Hamel, a position overlooking the German forces in Villers-Bretonneux. The 21st battalion gained possession of three German trenches. During this attack, the Querrieu brewery company formed the left wing of the battalion. On 20 July, in front of the castle of Querrieu, General Monash awarded commendations and medals to the 4th infantry Division which distinguished itself during the battle of Le Hamel, with the loss of 24 officers and 240 men. A British siege battery, set north of the village, launched a barrage on the German positions of Villers-Bretonneux. The German artillery responded, destroying houses and farms, and severely damaged the church. British siege artillery : 9.2 inch Howitzer supporting the Australian Corps in May 1918 near the Somme On 27 March 1918, the 2nd Australian Tunneling Company was billeted at Querrieu. One of its first actions was the creation of a cemetery, in which eight of its men will be buried from 9 April to 13 June. This cemetery was closed in August; 103 Australian and British soldiers are buried there.Querrieu British cemeteryQuerrieu British cemetery, 1918 Population :Querrieu population history from 1700 to 2006 Sports =Golf= Owned by the Golf Club d'Amiens, the golf course is situated on the south of Querrieu wood. It opened as a nine-hole course, and is at present an eighteen-hole course of 6114 metres. The large clubhouse serves the large membership (590 at present) and course players.Querrieu : Golf Club d'Amiens Ancient activities =Water mill= From its origins to the Revolution A seigniorial property, the flour mill is on the right bank of the Hallue River. It has been mentioned in extant documents dating from the thirteenth century, charters regulating relations between seigniories for its use, rents and obligations. In 1792, \\"le moulin √† bled tournant et travaillant\\" is hired for 2000 livres per year by the \\"ci-devant\\" seignior, but the miller abandoned the lease after three years, citing difficult competition from three wind-mills which had been recently erected in the village. The mill in 1812 By 1812 the mill was in disrepair. In that year the owner (the ci-devant seignior), encouraged by an agricultural renewal, made significant repairs.Archives d√©partementales de la Somme : 3E 5071 acte 358Archives d√©partementales de la Somme : 3E 5086 actes 369, 371 =General view= The mill house, built of bricks and tile covered, contains the mill machinery. The river water course is elevated to have sufficient energy for the undershot wheel moving inside a diversion dam beside the river's natural course. Sluice gates control water levels. =Mill machinery= The machinery is made of wood. Querrieu, the wheel- mill The waterwheel, with 28 paddles, is mounted on a 40 cm-diameter axle. Motion of the waterwheel is transferred to the runner stone, which is made to rotate faster than the waterwheel. There are two mill stones, the bed stone at the bottom and the runner stone. The iron-bound bed stone is formed of seven pieces of sandstone. The iron-bound runner stone is formed of nine pieces of sandstone with a hole in its center in which the grain can run off from a bin on the upper floor of the mill-house. The grain is crushed between the two stones; flour and bran are collected in a peripheral bin and fall into a bolting reel to be separated. Eventually the bran is crushed to obtain a second quality flour. Near the end of the nineteenth century the wooden components were replaced by pieces fabricated from iron. Milling operations ceased in 1914; after that the machinery was utilized as a sawmill until 1940. =Millers= From fathers to sons, a family of millers worked this mill from 1812 to 1914. =Sugar refinery= In April 1874, on the territory of Querrieu, a sugar beet refinery named \\"La Sucrerie\\" was established. Its location was selected due to the intersecting roads (from nearby beet farms) and a nearby water source. Harvested beets are hauled to the factory after they have been weighed and analyzed for sugar content. Mechanical process A 35CV steam-engine drove hoisting-gear, a washing machine, a shredding machine, and various pumps. After being washed the beets are shredded and spread on screens. The screens are pressed to extract the juice. The residue is the pulp. Querrieu, the beet refinery in 1880 Chemical process Some bone-black is introduced into the juice raised to the temperature of 80 ¬∞C, to eliminate the coloured substances. Some lime, produced in an oven settled close to the workshops, is added to neutralize the acids. Sulphuric acid is then added introduced to transform the lime excess in sulphates forming some outer-coating. Physical process The syrup is passing through a condenser battery where the evaporation is activated by a cooling obtained by an important cold water flow. This condense battery evaporates 2500 hectolitres of juice per day. Granulated sugar obtained after evaporation is shaped into the moulds for its commercialization. In 1876, the production was of : 800 metric tons of sugar, 500 metric tons of pulp and 400 metric tons of molasse. Staff A hamlet was created close to the factory : a cottage for the manager, eight houses for a foreman, a supervisor, a book keeper, three firemen, a mason and four workers. The seasonal workers may board in an inn, near the hamlet. Activity cessation Far away from any railway or waterway and having to cope with municipality protestations for damages on their roads involved by the heavy waggons during the rainy season, the factory is unable to develop any extension. In addition to these difficulties, competing with some more important factories using new production techniques and having better profit earning, the Company falls in bankruptcy in September 1883. Recovered by a shareholder, the factory goes on working until 1890, before its end of all activity.Archives d√©partementales de la Somme ; 99 O 3143 and 99 O 3074 =Textiles= Making use of a William Lee invention, stocking frame spread out in Amiens with high quality wools prescribed by the local weaver guild. To get round the rule and obtain lower cost produce, a family of stocking makers (faiseurs de bas au m√©tier) settled down in Querrieu about the middle of the 18th century, the wool coming from local sheep-farming, carding and spinning being carried out by craftsmen of the village. The names of eleven stocking makers appear on the 1836 census. Knitting About 1850, some knitting workshops, making use of original English knitting machines Mule-jenny invented by Samuel Crompton, were operating in Querrieu. In 1881, ninety-eight knitters (men and women) in workshops or at home, live in the village. The last workshop opened in 1925, was running with machines driven by electrical engines; all activities ceased in 1950. File:Mule-jenny.jpg|Mule-jenny used in French knitting workshops Places of interest =Castle= At an indeterminate time, but probably in order to fight the Norsemen invaders in the 10th century, a fortress was built on the right bank of the river Hallue, close to the Gallo-Roman road Amiens- Bapaume. It was a dark and heavy building in thick walls of bricks, pierced of rare and narrow holes. Wide ditches and deep ponds defended approach of the fortress on which the access was only possible by a drawbridge. The ground floor was in strong sandstone and heavy towers covered in dome, defended the fortified manor. Castle of Querrieu. Aquarelle by Oswald Macqueron, 1870 At the setting up of the seigniory in marquisate in 1653, the fortress was fit up in a seigniorial castle.Querrieu castle, in Patrimoine de France After the death of her husband in 1735, Anne-Fran√ßoise Perrin, dowager marquess, undertakes to change the fortress into a building pleasant to live in. The new castle consists in a main part formed by a ground-floor surmounted by a storey, enclosed by two turrets in fore-parts built over the subfoundations in sandstone of the two old towers, and prolonged by two pavilions on extremities. The new castle is preceded by a courtyard bordered by walls and bars. French style gardens with a large basin are spreading on the rear. After the death of Louis Fran√ßois de Gaudechart in 1832, his widow, Princess Cl√©mentine Charlotte de Rohan-Rochefort, embellishes the castle and its surroundings. An extra storey and attics were added to the main part of the building, the whole crowded by a balustrade in white stone. The park surrounding the castle was extensively enlarged ; a new enclosure in stones and bricks was built and a large iron gate opening to the village. All these arrangements are subsisting nowadays. Most parts of inside ornaments come from the nineteenth century, particularly panellings of the ground-floor rooms, and inlaid-work of parquetry. During World War I, the castle was occupied by several British and Australian military High Quarters. After the murderous Bullecourt battle, on April 11 and May 13, 1917, Sir William Ridell Birdwood, commandant of the Australian Corps on the West front, came to rest in the castle of Querrieu. He stood there until his promotion in command of the 5th British Army. After the death, without lineage on April 17, 1878, of Raoul de Gaudechart last marquess of Querrieu, the castle became property of Marie- Th√©r√®se de Gaudechart direct descendant of Robert de Gaudechart seignior of Querrieu, wife of the count Alvar d'Alcantara, of Belgian nobility.Belgian nobility In 1927, the name of Querrieu was added to those of d'Alcantara. Nowadays, the castle is still inhabited by the family d'Alcantara de Querrieu. =Church= The church is dedicated to Saint Gervais and Saint Protais.Querrieu church, in Patrimoine de France Querrieu church Architecture The church of Querrieu bordering a chalky table-land, is looking down upon the Hallue river. It appears of heterogeneous construction, but the careful scrutiny of its architecture, is able to gives us its dates of modification. The choir is bordered on each side by three columns without any capital and joined together by nibs of prismatic profile. Columns and walls sustain a frame hidden by a wooden ceiling. The apse is opened by large bays of Gothic style. The geminate central one represents Jesus the Saviour IHS. From an ancient transept, only one of the two arms on the north side subsists, used as a strong bell tower, from which the walls are pierced with ogival bays. Thus, this part of the church may be dated of the fourteenth or the fifteenth century. The altar coming from the Abbey of Saint-Acheul of Amiens, was bought in 1805. Altar, steps and tabernacle made of painted oak, form a harmonious whole. A Beam of Glory, modest reduction of a rood screen, was marking a separation between the choir and the nave. Two holes in pillars sustaining the high ogival Triumpal arch, are nowadays the only memory of that beam. All bays are fitted with coloured stained glass. Their tints are green and gold on the geminate bay of the apse and the large one over the portal, red and blue prevail on all the others. The simple observation of the joining of the choir with the nave and the bell tower, clearly marks the posteriority of the nave building. This construction without any architectural style is mainly characterised by its strength. Its eight pillars surmounted by heavy walls sustain the roof-tree by four beams and middle posts. The octagonal base of the baptismal font, the column and the vat are made of limestone and may be dated of the sixteenth century. The cap on neo-gothic style, made of oak with sunken decorations, is dated of 1860. The pulpit was offered in 1709. The internal face of the roof is decorated with the Holy Ghost dove.

Born a slave in Bardstown, Kentucky, just before the Civil War, he rose to become a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church at the age of 33, then president of the National Afro- American Council, the nation's largest civil rights organization, at the age of 40, serving in that post for most of the next decade.Fleming, \\"Alexander Walters,\\" in Dictionary of American Negro Biography. Biography Walters was born August 1, 1858, in Bardstown, Kentucky, the oldest son of Henry and Harriet Walters. He was educated at a private school taught by a number of teachers. In 1871 he moved to Louisville, Kentucky where he worked as a waiter in private homes, hotels, and on steamboats.Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell & Company, 1887, pp. 340‚Äì343. He was valedictorian of his high school class in 1875. Within two years, he was licensed to preach by the A.M.E. Zion Quarterly Conference, serving pastorates in Indianapolis, Louisville, San Francisco, Portland, Oregon, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, Tennessee, before his assignment to Mother Zion Church in New York City in 1888. In 1889, the Walters was selected to represent the Zion Church in London at the World's Sunday School Convention, and went on to visit other parts of Europe, Egypt, and the Holy Land. In May 1892, he was elected bishop of the Seventh District of the General Conference of the A.M.E. Zion Church, meeting in Pittsburgh. While in New York, he became acquainted with journalist Timothy Thomas Fortune, who was in the process of organizing his National Afro-American League, designed to protect African Americans against lynching and racial discrimination. Walters immediately endorsed the League, which met in early 1890 in Knoxville, but went defunct by 1893. =National Afro-American Council= c. 1900 In March 1898, alarmed by an upsurge in violent lynchings of African Americans across the country, Walters asked Fortune to publish a nationwide appeal for a meeting of African American leaders. More than 150 leaders from across the country signed the call, which resulted in an organizational meeting in Rochester, New York, in September 1898, also attended by Susan B. Anthony and the widow of Frederick Douglass. The new National Afro-American Council was intended to replicate the old League. Its constitution declared the Council nonpartisan in nature, and envisioned a structure of state and local councils, gathered together in annual meetings with delegates from affiliated organizations, schools, and newspapers, to protest against racial injustice and discrimination and to lobby for protective laws. Walters was elected the first president, while Fortune became the first chairman of the executive committee. Beginning in Washington, D.C., in December 1898, the Council met in large cities around the country, attracting large audiences of African- American journalists, clergymen, lawyers, educators, and community activists. Its officers included a wide range of influential African-American men and women. The Council met in Chicago (1899), Indianapolis (1900), and Philadelphia (1901), each time re-electing Walters to the presidency and adopting outspoken, occasionally radical resolutions. Afro-American Council at 1902 meeting in Saint Paul, Minnesota At the meeting in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1902, Walters stepped aside to become chairman of the executive committee, and Fortune was promoted to president. A prot√©g√© of Booker T. Washington, Fortune began to steer the Council away from the independent course favored by Walters, and the Council soon slid into dormancy. Walters bided his time, regaining the presidency in Detroit in 1905, after issuing an appeal to old members to return. He was reelected at New York (1906) and Baltimore (1907), but the Council, now under the control of militant members of the Niagara Movement, gradually lost its cohesiveness and stability. Walters' prominence had grown to such a level that on January 10, 1916, he met with President Woodrow Wilson at the White House to discuss how best to obtain the confirmation of African-Americans nominated for federal office by Wilson. Writing to Wilson, after that meeting Walters said: \\"After leaving the White House the idea occurred to me that it might be a good thing to see the Senators who have declared themselves opposed to the Confirmation of colored men who are nominated by yourself for office.\\" He continues; \\"If you have not any objection, I would like to take up with the Senators the matter of Confirmation of colored men for it would greatly handicap us in the Fall Campaign and would be all the Republicans would want to use against us to be able to say for certainty that Democratic Senators will not confirm colored men. We will not insist on the nomination of a colored man for the Recorder of Deeds but we do think, that a similar office carrying about the same salary should be given us...To surrender would destroy our chances of building up the Colored Democratic Organization.\\" =Later life= In 1908, Walters refused an offer by W. E. B. Du Bois to merge the council with the Niagara Movement and two other organizations. Walters angered many black followers by endorsing Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan in 1908. The council soon dissolved, but Walters wasted little time seeking a new power base, emerging as president of the new National Independent Political League. In the 1910s, he became a member of both the new National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Urban League. Walters traveled abroad frequently, including frequent trips to London, where he attended the Pan-African Conference in 1900 (giving a paper entitled \\"The Trials and Tribulations of the Coloured Race in America\\"),\\"Sylvester Williams\\" , Spartacus Educational. and becoming President of the Pan-African Association, and visited West Africa in 1910 and the Caribbean in 1911. A well-respected figure internationally, he declined an offer in 1915 by US President Woodrow Wilson to become US minister to Liberia. Walters died on February 2, 1917 in New York City, of natural causes. His funeral was at Zion Church; his eulogy was said by Bishop G. W. Clinton, while services were conducted by Bishop J. S. Caldwell and assisted by Rev J. W. Brown.Bishop Alexander Walters (obituary), New York Herald (New York, New York), February 7, 1917, p. 7. Retrieved September 30, 2019. Private life Walters was married three times, and had six children. His first wife, Katie Knox Walters, died in 1896; his second wife, Emeline Virginia Byrd Walters, died in 1902. He was survived by his third wife, Lelia Coleman Walters. Just his death, his wife was employed as a clerk for the United States Bureau of Immigration on Ellis Island. The couple's son, Hillis Walters (1904‚Äì1984), was an actor during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s and, later, a composer. His most successful composition was the song \\"Pass Me By\\" (1946), with lyrics by Mercer Ellington. It was recorded by Lena Horne, Carmen McRae and Peggy Lee.

Moreau-Vauthier first achieved public renown with his statue La Parisienne shown at the Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris, and is now perhaps best known for his memorial wall to the Victimes des r√©volutions (Mur des F√©d√©r√©s) on Avenue Gambetta, Paris. He also created an allegorical work to commemorate Louis Bl√©riot's first cross-Channel airplane flight in 1909. His work was also part of the art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics and the 1932 Summer Olympics. A veteran of the Battle of Verdun, Moreau-Vauthier had the idea in 1920 to memorialize World War I by installing a series of sculpted stones along the 650 km front from Nieuwpoort, Belgium through Moosch near Altkirch, and on to the Franco-Swiss border. He presented his first model that year in Paris; Henri Defert, president of the Touring Club of France, endorsed the idea and invited the Belgian Touring Club to join the project. A total of 240 markers were planned (28 in Belgium, 212 in France), of which 118 were erected (22 in Belgium, 96 in France) in the years between 1921 and 1927. Three basic designs differ primarily in the helmet capping the milestone (French, Belgium, British), with side decorations of infantryman's gear such as water bottles, hand grenades, etc. Moreau-Vauthier died in 1936 in a car accident at Ruffigny near Niort in Deux-S√®vres, and is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

The film is an adaptation of the novel of the same title by Catalan author Juan Mars√©, which was based on the killing of Carmen Broto. Set mostly in the old quarter of 1940s Barcelona, the film centers in a young rag and bone merchant who falls in love with a prostitute. If They Tell You I Fell has an intricate narrative in which real and imagined stories blend in a crosswords style. Plot In the post Spanish Civil War years, Catalan kids would sit in circles among the ruins and tell stories, known as \\"aventis\\" open-ended narratives drifting back and forth through time. Laced with horror and perversity, these tales mix war stories, local gossip, comic book characters, fantasy and real events. The \\"aventis\\" of this film are told in flashback in 1970, 1940, 1936 and the mid-1980s. In 1970, Nito, a medical examiner assistant and sister Paulina, a nurse-nun (who grew up together, and now are co-workers in a hospital) identify the corpse of a couple who had drowned during a car accident. The dead man is Daniel Javaloyes \\"Java\\", one of the main characters of the \\"aventis\\" of their childhood and adolescence. The woman seems to be Juanita, who forty years before was one of many orphans. The discovery of Java‚Äôs body (long presumed dead) leads them to remember what had happened decades before. Flashbacks reveal a story that may or may not have happened. In the old quarter of 1940s Barcelona inhabitants are struggling to survive among the ruins left by the Spanish Civil War. Daniel Javaloyes, \\"Java\\" is one of them. He is a young man trying by any means to leave behind the misery around him. He lives in a dilapidated house with his grandmother, a mute trapper. To make some money, the hardened Java performs perverse sexual acts for the voyeuristic pleasure of Don Conrado, a rich sadistic man, who uses a wheelchair after being wounded during the war. In one of those sexual encounters for hire, Java has violent sex with Ramona, a visibly pregnant prostitute. From then on Java is smitten with the fallen woman. Initially he finds out very little about her, but when Conrado‚Äôs mother visits him also looking for her, Java learns that Ramona had been a maid in Don Conrado‚Äôs household. She bears a scarred left nipple caused by his sadism. Marcos, Java‚Äôs older brother, was an anarchist during the war and now is hiding on the grounds of the family‚Äôs house. He yearns to see his girlfriend, Aurora Nin, again, whose identity would be blended with Ramona‚Äôs in the stories told by Sarnita, one of the kids in Java‚Äôs neighborhood. Sarnita entertains his friends telling them aventis, mixing real events with others that have been invented. Aurora Nin and Java are prominent figures in those stories. Meanwhile, the perverse Don Conrado is directing a religious amateur play about the sacrifice of a Christian martyr. Fuegui√±a, one of the orphans in the institution where Paulina works, plays the leading role. Java wants to be an actor and blackmails Fuegui√±a in order to take the part of the devil in the play. Reluctantly Conrado allows him to participate, at least during rehearsals. Flash back to 1936. During the war, Marcos, fighting for the Republic, takes revenge on Don Conrado‚Äôs brutality towards his girlfriend Aurora Nin. When the men under Marco‚Äôs command do not find Conrado, they kill Conrado‚Äôs father instead. Conrado‚Äôs mother barely escapes with her life thanks to Aurora‚Äôs intervention. In one of his sexual assignments for Conrado, Java has a young man as a sexual partner instead of a woman. He does not back down, but knowing that Ado, the teenager, has been paid twice as much, he follows him to get a bigger share of the money. Through Ado, Java gets involved with a rich jewelry dealer. In him, Java sees the opportunity to escape his poverty- restricted life. In 1940, Marcos‚Äô old cronies from the war are also looking for him. Still trying secret anti-government plots, they have resorted mainly to criminal activities. Palau, the leader of the gang has chosen his target: Menchu, a bleach blonde prostitute who works for the elite Falangist of the city. To strike them back, Palau and his partners Fusam and Sendra attack Menchu, brutally killing her. When his pursuit of Ramona proves aimless, Java, now sure that Ramona is in fact Aurora Nin, leads Ramona to Marcos‚Äôs secret hiding place and the former lovers are happily reunited. Taking advantage of a commotion in the neighborhood Marcos and Ramona managed to escape the city. In modern day Barcelona, by the mid-1980s, Palau, on a busy street, has a glance of an old couple asking for money. They seem to be Marcos and Aurora Nin. Cast If They Tell You I Fell has a large cast headed by Jorge Sanz and Victoria Abril. It was their first of three collaborations under Vicente Aranda's direction. Victoria Abril, Aranda‚Äôs favorite actress, plays three different roles in the film. She was six months pregnant when she shot the explicit sexual scenes in the film.Colmena, Vicente Aranda, p. 185 Antonio Banderas has a small role. Two of the young actors: Juan Diego Botto and Maria Botto (they are siblings) became very popular in the Spanish screens in the following years. * Jorge Sanz as Java * Victoria Abril as Ramona / Menchu / Aurora Nin * Antonio Banderas as Marcos * Lluis Homar as Palau * Juan Diego Botto as Sarnita * Mar√≠a Botto as Fuegui√±a *Guillermo Montesinos as Fusam *Aitor Merino as Ado *Montserrat Salvador as Conrado‚Äôs mother *Carlos Tristancho as Sendra Production Producer Enrique Viciano suggested a film adaptation of a novel by Catalan author Juan Mars√© to director Vicente Aranda, who had previously adapted Mars√©'s novel The Girl with the Golden Panties, making it into an art house hit. Aranda was given the choice between Mars√©'s novels: Ronda de Guinard√≥ and If They Tell You I Fell. He chose the second one. In fact years before Aranda had wanted to make that novel into a film, but found the project too risky due to the novel's intricate narrative and complicated plot.C√°nov√°s, Miradas sobre el cine de Vicente Aranda, p. 64 Vicente Aranda wrote the script in the summer of 1987 between shooting his films El Lute: Run for Your Life and El Lute II : Tomorrow I'll Be Free.C√°nov√°s, Miradas sobre el cine de Vicente Aranda, p. 63 He simplified the story but kept the puzzling structure of the book. The film was made with a budget of P168 million pesetas and P60 million aid from the Spanish Ministry of Culture. The film was shot in Barcelona. Si te Dicen que Ca√≠ at IMDB Reception If They Tell You I Fell opened on 19 September 1989 at the San Sebastian Film festival. In Spain it was received coldly by audiences and critics.Colmena, Vicente Aranda, p. 184 However Jorge Sanz won Spain's Goya Award as Best Actor for his performance. The film had a limited release in the United States in New York City. The review in Variety praised the direction, but remarked: \\"Those with the patience to see this film two or three times, or read the novel by Juan Mars√© upon which it is based ahead of time, may understand its convoluted plot. Ordinary film goers will be hard pressed to make any sense out of what they see on the screen.\\"Variety, October 4, 1989, p. 37 Awards and nominations * Seven Goya Awards nominations.

The original members Runacres, Way, Harrison and Diagram were joined by Phil Lukes (previously in The Mancinis and Dutch Uncle). Lukes had also worked with Runacres on a project under the name Brightside. Andy Diagram and Richard Harrison also formed a trumpet and drums duo under the name spaceheads. They have released seven albums and toured the world since 1993. A new Dislocation Dance album, Cromer, was released by Vinyl Japan in 2005. This featured Runacres, Lukes, Diagram, and several other performers. The BBC sessions had been released on CD by Vinyl Japan in 1999, and the band's New Hormones and Rough Trade catalogue issued on remastered CDs by LTM in 2006. In 2007 Dislocation Dance played in Manchester, at the Carlton Club in Whalley Range. The line-up consisted of Runacres, Lukes, Way and Harrison again. They were joined by Jon Board (trumpet) and Andrew Weaver (keyboards). Runacres, Lukes, Board and Weaver began working on new material and in 2009 were joined by Chris Gravestock (drums). Their fifth studio album, The Ruins of Manchester, was released in May 2012. This was followed by their sixth and latest album, on LTM records 'Are We There Yet?', released in 2017 and featuring their new vocalist Sam Heywood.

History In late 1849 the company began a service from Liverpool to Gibraltar, Malta and Constantinople, using its new iron screw steamer the 500 ton Bosphorus. The similarly sized ships Hellespont and Propontis joined the Bosphorus on the service as soon as they were completed. In 1850 the company secured the contract to carry the monthly mail between Plymouth and Cape Town for ¬£30,000 a year. The Bosphorus initiated the service in December 1850 and reached Cape Town after a 40-day voyage, 5 days more than the period specified in the contract. Following this, orders were placed with C.J. Mare and Company at Leamouth, London (builders of the earlier vessels) for the new ships Queen of the South, Lady Jocelyn, Indiana, Calcutta, Mauritius and Hydaspes In May 1852 an additional mail contract was secured, for the company to provide a monthly service between England and Madras and Calcutta, via Cape St. Vincent, Ascension Island, St. Helena, Cape Town, Mauritius and Ceylon. The company also initiated a mail service between Cape Town and Durban, which had previously been either overland service which generally took about 3 weeks or carried by sailing ships. This service was undertaken by the Sir Robert Peel. =Australian service= The Australian Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company began a mail service between England and Australia in June 1852 which proved so unreliable that their contract was withdrawn in April 1853, whereupon the General Screw Company (which had already despatched two steamships to Australia earlier in the year) stepped in with a regular service. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald in February 1853 describes the somewhat \\"unpropitious\\" circumstances which marked the journey from London to Port Jackson of the third of the Australian Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company's steamships, the Melbourne. The journey, which took about 4 months overall, but with running time of only 65 days, and the specifications of this ship are described in some detail. The General Screw Steam Shipping Company's new steamer, the 1800-ton Argo, sailed from Southampton on 8 May 1853 and reached Melbourne in 64 days, with one stop en route at Cape St. Vincent. She returned via Cape Horn and received considerable acclaim as the first steamer to circumnavigate the globe. The company's Indian service had been a failure due to various causes, including mechanical problems causing steamers to break down, unexpected high costs and coal consumption, and disappointing passenger and cargo results. Therefore, the service was withdrawn, the last sailing taking place on 15 March 1854. Despite securing a short-term mail contract, the Australian service was withdrawn as well, the Argo sailing from Southampton on 4 October 1854 on the last voyage. The company chartered its new and now superfluous ships Golden Fleece, Jason and The Prince to the government to carry troops to the Mediterranean. =American service= In March 1854 the Indiana inaugurated a new service for the company, from Le Havre and Southampton to New York under the management of Croskey and Company, agents for the American-owned Ocean Navigation Company which was then operating a monthly service between New York, Southampton and Le Havre. It was intended that Indiana and Mauritius should sail monthly between Le Havre, Southampton and New York, alternating with the American steamers to provide a combined weekly service from Southampton. In July 1854 the company accepted a proposal by the government of Mauritius to operate a monthly service between Mauritius and Ceylon for ¬£10,000 a year. = Crimean War = All the company's ships were chartered as troop transports during the Crimean War from 1854 - 1855; three were lost to various causes. The Prince was destroyed during a hurricane in November 1854, the Mauritius was badly damaged due to fire while in drydock at Southampton in February 1855, and the Croesus was destroyed by fire in April of the same year. Following the end of the war, the company sold its entire fleet to the European and American Steam Shipping Company in 1857.

The true function of the system and the shore terminals, in which output of the array at sea was processed and displayed by means of the Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder (LOFAR), was classified and the term \\"Naval Facility\\" was intentionally vague. Its function was described as oceanographic research. The facility was built about twelve miles from the town of Nantucket on a part of a site that had been used in World War II as an ordinance site and practice bombing range. Locally the facility was sometimes known as the Tom Nevers Naval Facility for the area of Nantucket island where it stood.This was apparently the local name, predating the establishment of the SOSUS Naval Facility, applied to the leased ordnance site that was officially the Nantucket Ordnance Site. In 1980 the property was sold to the Town of Nantucket and is now a park managed by the Parks and Recreation Commission.  History  Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Nantucket was among the first Atlantic systems ordered and installed with the shore facility commissioned 1 August 1955. The facility, along with the entire Atlantic system at the time, was experimental though it quickly became operational. The visible shore installations and obvious cable work done in connection with their construction required a cover story explaining them as oceanographic research facilities and that data gathered by oceanographic and acoustic surveys with ships could at times be collected \\"more expeditiously and more economically by means of shore stations. These are the U. S. Naval Facilities.\\" The \\"oceanographic\\" cover included the entire span of the facility's existence and decommissioning on 30 June 1976 with the SOSUS mission being declassified in 1991. The site, about twelve miles from the town of Nantucket on Tom Never‚Äôs Head at the southernmost tip of the island, had been part of the Nantucket Ordnance Site. During World War II the land had been leased by the government from September 1943 through 30 June 1946 for use as the Nantucket Ordnance Site (also known as Tom Nevers Rocket Projectile Target) used for as an aerial rocket range by pilots from the Quonset Naval Air Station. Lofargram writers on watch floor. In 1958 the facility was still in Quonset huts housing both the sensitive electronic equipment and eight officers and eighty-nine enlisted men. Within five years the temporary buildings had deteriorated putting the terminal building electronics at risk. The complement had grown to ten officers and ninety-four enlisted men and new combination administration building and barracks was requested along with a mess hall and recreation facilities. It was evident that the classified details of the system and its shore terminal was not clear even to some high ranking Senators as the same request for replacement buildings was met by questions in the Senate Committee as to why it could not be moved to another location, including the Boston Navy Yard, and why its \\"oceanographic work\\" could not be done at Woods Hole. The Navy again requested funds in 1964 to upgrade facilities to permanent buildings. Fourteen units of family housing were authorized in 1967. The surveillance system shore processing facilities underwent backfits during the late 1960s at the stations replacing original equipment with more modern equipment including moving from electromechanical spectrum analysis to digital. A bomb shelter for President John F. Kennedy, to be used in the event of a nuclear attack while President Kennedy was in Hyannisport, was located under a mound built on the facility. The first decommissioning of SOSUS shore stations came in 1976 when the first to be commissioned, Naval Facility Punta Borinquen (commissioned 18 September 1954 as NAVFAC Ramey), Puerto Rico, was closed on 30 April followed by Naval Facility Nantucket on 30 June. Return to civilian use The Town of Nantucket purchased the property from the Navy in 1980 for with the intent it would be used as a recreation area. The approximately twenty-five acres included over of shoreline. Fifteen acres were transferred to the Nantucket Housing Authority and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) leased the recreation building and some three adjacent acres on which they sponsor an annual beach carnival. Many of the Navy buildings and some of the paved roads had been removed after decommissioning of the Naval Facility and the remaining stripped buildings were in poor condition. The Terminal Building was close to collapse onto the beach due to erosion and the VFW building was only from the point of erosion on the coastal bank. The Nantucket Parks and Recreation Commission managed the property with the VFW managing its portion and holding public events there. The Nantucket Hunting Association obtained permission to use the bunker in 1995 but it was later used by Parks and Recreation as storage. By 2018 there was interest in restoring the bunker as a museum and attraction and there was some interest in obtaining objects that had been used in the West Palm Beach Kennedy bunker, which had closed, and associating with former management of that site. As of 2020 the Town and County of Nantucket shows the Tom Nevers Park owned and managed by the Parks and Recreation Commission. Erosion Beach erosion was a problem, clearly by 1969 and by closure was threatening the Terminal Building containing all the equipment. After closure the Terminal Building was in danger of toppling onto the beach and was eventually demolished.

Genomics The species within the family Pseudonocardiaceae form a distinct clade in phylogenetic trees based on concatenated protein sequences. Additionally, Nakamurella multipartite, currently part of the order Frankiales, also formed a clade with the Pseudonocardiaceae species in 100% of the bootstrap replications of the phylogenetic trees. A conserved signature indel has been identified which is found in N. multipartite and all but one of the Pseudonocardiaceae species. This one-amino-acid insertion in UMP kinase serves to both provide a molecular marker for nearly all of the Pseudonocardiaceae and suggests N. multipartite is closely related to this group. Some evidence also suggests the orders Pseudonocardiales and Corynebacteriales are closely related. Several conserved signature indels have been identified which are found in both Pseudonocardiales and Corynebacteriales, including a three- amino-acid insertion in a conserved region of UDP-galactopyranose mutase. This insertion is also present in N. multipartite and Geodermatophilus obscurus, another member of Frankiales. Additionally, five conserved signature proteins have been identified which are found only in the orders Pseudonocardiales and Corynebacterialess.

Early in his career he also wrote short stories and co-authored two novels for TSR. Fortier grew up in New Hampshire and now resides in Colorado. He graduated from St. Thomas Aquinas High School, in Dover. He served in the U.S. Army between 1965 and 1968 and is a Vietnam veteran. Upon his discharge, he attended the Southern New Hampshire University earning a BS degree in Business Administration. During his comics career, he wrote many series for Now Comics, including the best selling Green Hornet series done with artist Jeff Butler and Terminator Burning Earth, with Alex Ross. He later adapted a Gene Roddenberry's Lost Universe for Tekno Comix, and wrote an Incredible Hulk Annual. Following his work on comic books, he returned to longer fiction with a series of pulp fiction novels, short stories, and a 2001 play. In 2006, along with artist Rob Davis, he started Airship 27 Productions, a production company devoted to publishing new adventures of classic pulp heroes. The company first worked with Wild Cat Books but in 2007 they partnered with Cornerstone Book Publishers of New Orleans. Also in 2007 Fortier created pulp SF revival character \\"Mars McCoy.\\" In 2011 Fortier and Airship 27 ended their partnership with Cornerstone and began publishing their books under their own Airship 27 Productions imprint. Fortier writes new Captain Hazzard novels based on a classic one-shot magazine from 1938 and created the new pulp character, Brother Bones; the Undead Avenger. At the same time they started Redbud Studio to publish their own comics via the on-demand printing company, KaBlam. Redbud Studios publishes Fortier's comedy super-hero series, Mr. Jigsaw Man of a Thousand Parts illustrated by Gary Kato and edited by Rob Davis. In 2011, Twilight Star Studio and Redbud Studio Comics began publishing Ron Fortier's Tales of the Macabre, a series of horror short stories written by Fortier and illustrated by comics industry up-and-coming artists. There have been six volumes to date including a collected edition. In 2017 Fortier was the recipient of the Pulp Factory's first Pulp Grand Master Award. Fortier has also co-written three novels with the late science fiction author Ardath Mayhar.

It is a remake of the 1981 Canadian slasher film of the same name. The film focuses on the residents of a small town that is plagued by a serial killer in mining gear on Valentine's Day. After filming on location in Pennsylvania, the film was given a 3D theatrical release in the United States by Lionsgate. It was the first R-rated film to be projected in RealD technology and to have a wide release (1,000 locations) in 3D-enabled theaters. My Bloody Valentine 3D was released on January 16, 2009, and grossed $100.7 million worldwide on a budget of $14 million. It received mixed-to- positive reviews from film critics. Plot On Valentine's Day 1997, the small mining community of Harmony is rocked by an explosion at the Hanniger mine. Comatose Harry Warden is the sole survivor, after killing five fellow miners to conserve his own oxygen. Tom Hanniger, son of the mine's owner, is blamed for the explosion. One year later, Warden awakens from his coma and murders numerous patients and staff, leaving a victim's heart in a box of chocolates. While Tom, his girlfriend Sarah, and other teenagers party inside the mine, Warden ‚Äì wearing mining gear and a gas mask ‚Äì attacks them with a pickaxe. Sarah, Axel, and Irene flee, and Warden is shot by Sheriff Burke before he can kill Tom, but escapes into the mine. Ten years later, Tom is called back to Harmony after his father dies. He plans to sell the mine, against the advice of local politician Ben Foley. Axel, now the town's sheriff, has married Sarah but is having an affair with her coworker Megan. At the motel where Tom is staying, a masked assailant in mining gear murders Irene along with a truck driver and a hotel clerk. Investigating the scene, Axel discovers the trucker's camera footage revealing the Miner, implying that Warden has returned. Axel receives a chocolate box containing Irene's heart and draw his suspicions to Tom, who is rescued from a bar fight by the now- retired Burke. Touring the mine, Tom is locked inside a utility cage by the Miner who then murders another miner who had been accompanying Tom and disappears as others arrive. Axel reveals that ten years before, Foley and Burke found Warden after his attack and killed him before burying the body in the woods which disappeared recently. That night, Tom returns to the mine and finds Axel's cabin nearby. The Miner kills Foley and leaves his body in Warden's grave; realizing the killer must be one of the few people aware of the grave, Axel sends a deputy to guard his house. The Miner attacks Sarah and Megan at the grocery store, dragging the latter away before killing her just as Axel arrives. At the Palmers' house, the Miner kills their housekeeper. Deputy Ferris finds Sarah‚Äôs son Noah safe inside, but the Miner kills Burke. As Tom drives Sarah to Axel's cabin, Axel calls her and explains that Tom is the killer, having spent the last seven years in a mental institution. Tom claims that Axel is the real killer, but Sarah crashes the car and escapes into the woods. She calls Axel, who tells her to hide at his cabin, where she discovered the chocolate boxes in his closet. Convinced Axel is the killer, Sarah is attacked by the Miner who chases her into the mine. She runs into Axel, seizing his gun, and Tom arrives. Sarah holds them both at gunpoint as they protest their innocence, until Tom's knowledge of Megan's death inadvertently reveals he is the killer. The disturbed Tom has a hallucination, revealing the Miner is his split personality ‚Äì after returning to Harmony, he dug up Warden's mining gear and carried out the killings, framing Axel. After a struggle, Tom wounds Axel, and Sarah shoots Tom; the bullet passes through his side and strikes a fuel tank, igniting an explosion. Sarah and Axel are rescued from the resulting cave-in. Tom, who survives, murders the rescue worker who finds him and escapes. Cast Production The film was shot in South Western Pennsylvania, taking advantage of the state's tax incentives for film productions as well as the topographical and architectural versatility of the Pittsburgh Metro area. Filming began on May 11, 2008 in Armstrong County along the Route 28 corridor, in locations including Sprankle's Market in Kittanning, the Ford City police station, and the exterior of the Logansport Mine in Bethel.Fryer, Mitch (April 30, 2008). \\"Producers, crew scout area for horror film \\".

The film grossed $51,545,952 in the United States and Canada, and $49,188,766 in other markets for a worldwide total of $100,734,718. =Critical response= Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 63% of 107 critics gave the film a positive review, with the consensus reading: \\"This gory, senses-assaulting slasher film is an unpretentious, effective mix of old-school horror stylings and modern 3D technology.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 51 based on 11 reviews. Joe Leydon of Variety said, \\"director and co-editor Lussier (a frequent Wes Craven collaborator) plays the 3-D gimmick for all it's worth: Everything from tree branches and gun barrels to bloody pickaxes and bloodier body parts appears to jump off the screen. He also makes effective use of the depth-of-field illusion, allowing audiences long views of various chest cavities from which hearts have been rudely ripped. At the very least, the overall tech package is a great deal more impactful than that of the 3-D-lensed Friday the 13th Part III (1982)\\". He added, in spite of the \\"state- of-the-art 3-D camera trickery, which helmer Patrick Lussier shamelessly exploits to goose the audience with cheap thrills and full-bore gore, My Bloody Valentine is at heart an unabashedly retro work, reveling in the cliches and conventions of the slasher horror pics that proliferated in the early 1980s\\". Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said, the implemented 3-D technology enables \\"startling effects, but after a while the minor thrill of the trick is gone. Advances in digital technology have allowed the filmmakers to largely avoid the physical headaches that are perhaps the biggest hallmark of the cyclical attempts at 3-D moviemaking\\". He added, \\"wooden performances by forgettable, generic actors -- again, just like in the original -- don't aid in making things any less leaden\\", concluding My Bloody Valentine 3D is \\"just good enough to not be annoying\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said, \\"the creaky screenplay (by Todd Farmer and Zane Smith) is mercilessly at odds with the director's fine sense of pacing. From the moment you duck a flying mandible and gaze, mesmerized, at a severed hand oozing two inches from your nose, you'll be convinced that the extra dimension was worth seeking out. A strange synergy of old and new, My Bloody Valentine 3D blends cutting-edge technology and old-school prosthetics to produce something both familiar and alien: gore you can believe in\\". Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly graded the film a C+ and said that it \\"starts in spectacular fashion. But what really leaps out at you about My Bloody Valentine 3-D is its lack of imagination\\". Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter felt, \\"While the concept of adding 3-D to the horror genre is hardly new ... Patrick Lussier's film is the most accomplished example. The 3-D effects come fast and furious, rendered with a technical skill and humor that gives this otherwise strictly formulaic slasher picture whatever entertainment value it possesses.\\" He added, \\"the three leads actually manage to invest their roles with some depth, but the real acting treats come courtesy of veteran character actors Kevin Tighe and Atkins, whose presence provides a comforting bridge to horror films past.\\" =Home media= My Bloody Valentine 3D was released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 19, 2009 and has grossed in excess of $19.7 million, with DVD sales and theater gross revenue totaling over $119.9 million. Both home release versions have both a standard 2D version and the 3D version on the same disc using seamless branching. On October 5, 2010, Lionsgate Home Entertainment released My Bloody Valentine 3D on Blu-ray 3D which requires a 3D-capable HDTV, 3D Blu- ray player and 3D glasses. The disc also includes a 2D version of the film and all bonus materials included in the 2D Blu-ray version released after the film's initial theater run.

It was initially published by both Little, Brown and Company and Back Bay Publishing. The book was ranked by critics as one of the top books of the year, it was on the New York Times bestseller list for more than 10 weeks, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction, the Bancroft Prize for history, and the National Book Award. It was published in paperback in 1973 by Vintage Books.Frances Fitzgerald, Fire in the Lake, Internet Archive Open Library Summary This was the first major book by an American on Vietnam, its history, and the United States activities there. FitzGerald said it was a \\"first draft of history.\\" She explored thousands of years of the history and culture of Vietnam, showing how these affected the relations of its peoples with their encounter with the United States. She says that the US understood little about the country and its leaders, reacting to the threat of communism rather than recognizing the nation's long struggle to gain and keep its independence from foreign invaders. She argued that American values of freedom, democracy, optimism, and technological progress were inconsistent with Vietnam's values, culture, agrarian economy, and long history of warfare with France and China, making the Vietnam War effort doomed from the start. The Vietnamese sense of government, history, politics, and war is completely different from the American one. They have had a cultural tradition of ancestor worship and a different belief in what constitutes effective government (the Mandate of Heaven). The US government's failure to acknowledge these differences led to its failure in waging war there against the North Vietnamese and insurgents. FitzGerald wrote, \\"But the American officials in supporting the Saigon government insisted that they were defending 'freedom and democracy' in Asia. They left the GIs to discover that the Vietnamese did not fit into their experience of either 'communist' or 'democrats.' Under different circumstances this invincible ignorance‚Ä¶\\" She continued, \\"Whatever strategy the American government uses to carry on the war, it will only be delaying the inevitable.\\" The book discusses the US government's ignorance of Vietnam's history, especially their determination to rid themselves of foreign invaders. They fought against Chinese domination for 1000 years, despite the latter's vastly superior population and resources. Many of the people considered United States forces to be another wave of foreign invaders. The book covers the history in depth and reaches the Tet Offensive 90% of the way through the narrative. It explores the Cao ƒê√†i monotheist religious sect in Tay Ninh, the corrupt regime of Ngo Dinh Diem, and \\"Nixon's War\\". In her discussion of the Battle of Bong Son, Fitzgerald discusses the futility of the US use of body counts to tally successes: \\"Furthermore, as the only 'indicator of progress,' it suggested that death and destruction had some absolute value in terms of winning the war. That the enemy might continue to recruit, rearm, and rebuild (often with the help of people enraged by the American destruction) did not seem to enter into the calculations.\\" The book is one of the first to explore the Vietnamese shanty towns that developed around US bases. They were centers of laundry services, bars and food, and prostitution. Critical reception The book was highly acclaimed; it was noted by New York Times reviewers as one of the five most important books published in 1972. It was on the New York Times bestseller list for 10 weeks by May 1973. Due to its popularity and significance, it was published in paperback in 1973 by Vintage and is available online at the Internet Archive. It won several literary awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction,\\"General Nonfiction\\". Past winners and finalists by category. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2012-03-17. the National Book Award in Contemporary Affairs,. There was a \\"Contemporary\\" or \\"Current\\" award category from 1972 to 1980. and the Bancroft Prize for history. Scholar David G. Marr in The Journal of Asian Studies criticized FitzGerald's discussion of Vietnamese history and national character, given that she lacked the language and could not read its literature. He said that she tried to explain a \\"grand Vietnamese Gestalt\\" that was in opposition to Western values, but relied on Western thinkers to form her conclusions. But he said she was much more successful in her sections on US involvement, superior to other journalists in analyzing the \\"Diem regime's fundamental social and political weaknesses\\" and assessing the National Liberation Front.

Early life  Srikantan was born to a Sankethi Brahmin family in Rudrapatna, Hassan district of Karnataka, on Makara Sankranti day, 14 January 1920. His father R Krishnashastri was an orator, singer of Gamaka (storytelling), playwright, poet, and a harikatha vidwan.

The first new category is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver, parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. The third is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorization may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM and ICD classifications, but further research is required.Zeanah CH (2000). \\"Disturbances and disorders of attachment in early childhood\\".

It was located on the edge of the Hertfordshire village of Elstree and not in Aldenham. In its heyday, 50 buses a week were overhauled there, and it was the most comprehensive bus overhaul operation in the world. It opened in 1956 and closed in November 1986. The buildings were demolished in 1996. History  =1930s Origins= The London Transport site at Elstree had originally been bought for the Northern line extension to Bushey Heath, as part of the 1930s New Works Programme.\\"London Transport Workshops at Aldenham\\" Railway Gazette 2 November 1956 page 526 Construction of the railway extension was underway and the tube depot was partially complete at the outbreak of World War II. The railway works were stopped and the site was modified for use as an aircraft factory, producing Handley Page Halifax bombers as part of the London Aircraft Production consortium, together with Handley Page, Duple, Park Royal and London Transport. After the war, the construction of the railway extension was not restarted and the plan was finally dropped in September 1949. With the wartime bus fleet worn out and the existing Chiswick Bus Works struggling to cope, it was decided to redevelop the site for bus overhaul, specifically body and chassis structures, with Chiswick continuing to specialise in the running units (engines, gearboxes, etc.). Construction of the new facility began in 1952. The existing buildings were extended and converted into a bus overhaul works over a site, with its own staff canteen, social club and office blocks as well as the famous main building, test circuit and tilt test shed where London buses were subjected to being tilted on an inverter to assess stability. The site also had a power station on site to provide power for the works. =Post War= Although Aldenham had dealt with new vehicles and accident repairs from about 1945, it did not start full scale overhauling of bus bodies until 1949/50 and until 1955 chassis' were still dealt with at Chiswick. This was because, with the RTs, the bodies were jig-built which enabled the bus bodies to be a perfect fit on all the other RT chassis. At first, buses were dealt with on an individual basis, with each chassis and body being re-united after overhaul. A small number of changes of body among the RT family of buses was made during the period up to December 1955, at which point the 'works float' system of overhauling was re-introduced after being suspended during World War II. This meant that vehicle identities were again changed around so as to make full use of licences. In most cases, each bus arriving in the works was replaced by an identical one carrying the same identity, which meant that it was back on the road the same day in the majority of cases. The system came into full operation in January 1956. The works were officially opened on 30 October 1956, at which date it had a staff of 1,800, which was expected to increase to 2,500. The post-war standardisation and huge size of the London Transport fleet allowed maintenance along modern production line principles, with work being carried out on a number of buses at once. Several mechanics could focus on specific parts of the vehicle rather than a single mechanic working on a single bus at a time. Aldenham covered: * Body rebuilds * Repaints * Major accident repairs * Seat trimming * Destination blinds * New bus preparation * Tilt testing Aldenham turned the overhaul of buses into an industrial operation. A bus entering the works would first be inspected and any repairs required would be identified. The vehicle would have its body removed from the chassis, and then the running units such as brake system, axles, springs and other safety critical parts apart from the engine and gearbox would be removed from the chassis and would be inspected and, if needed, overhauled (at Chiswick works). Each one of these sub-structures would be sent off for inspection and overhaul on its own line at Chiswick. The bodies would be placed on an inverting frame and rotated to access the underside so that road debris could be removed by steam cleaning. The body would then be moved by travelling crane to one of the many parallel bays in the main shop area. The body was placed on stands with staging all around for maximum access to all parts of the body. The overhaul would include such necessary work to return the bus to virtually \\"as new\\" condition and would be tailored to each vehicle depending on condition. For example, the body would have any damaged panels replaced or repaired, seats repaired and re-covered and any updates or modifications to the interior made. The chassis would be inspected, tested and have any service components changed or adjusted. This system of standard interchangeable components meant that when the chassis was ready to be rebuilt into a bus, the first available engine, transmission and body that had been 'outshopped' would be fitted. It was highly unlikely that a chassis would leave the works with the same body, engine or gearbox that it entered with. Indeed, it was even possible for a bus to enter the works in the morning, and a bus carrying the same fleet number and registration number to leave later the same day - although a completely different vehicle. Once the chassis and body were re-united, the completed vehicle would be test run around the factory site, which would include a brake test. Providing all was well mechanically, the bus would pass through the paint shop for a new coat of paint and varnish and would be fitted with new fleet number and ownership transfers. Following fitting of newly covered seats and re-certification, it would be despatched out to the receiving garage to return to service. This modular system meant that buses could be overhauled in a fraction of the time that it would take if each bus was attended to on an individual basis. It was this attention and thoroughness that was largely responsible for buses such as the RT, RF and AEC Routemaster lasting so long. One of the unusual aspects of the Aldenham overhaul concept was the \\"Works Float\\" system. As chassis generally took less time to overhaul than did the bodies, this would have resulted in chassis cluttering up the works awaiting completed bodies. This required the number of bodies in the overhaul system to be greater than the number of chassis in the works. To provide this, a number of vehicle identifications became part of the works float and disappeared off the road, sometimes for years. Effectively, these buses ceased to exist except on paper, to provide the necessary spare components to allow the works float system to operate. This system permitted the number of road licences held to be less than the number of buses in existence, the unlicensed vehicles effectively being the vehicles under overhaul - a considerable financial saving. A system of separate chassis and body numbers was utilised to keep track of these major components. The works float system ceased in the mid-1980s when the practice of body separation was abandoned. Later 'off the peg' buses such as the Daimler Fleetlines were less suited to this style of maintenance, due to the bodies distorting if removed from their chassis. These vehicles would be overhauled but without separating the body/chassis - indeed, many of them did not last long enough in London Transport service to receive overhauls. Overhauls of vehicles of this type were therefore carried with the vehicle in \\"built up\\" form. LT had to set aside a separate area of the works for this type of work away from the \\"normal\\" work. Lifting jacks to raise vehicles were installed to enable access beneath. This type of overhaul resulted in the bus being off the road for weeks or even months, and was a very inefficient use of vehicle fleets. In 1970, London Transport's country area buses were transferred to the state-owned National Bus Company (NBC) as London Country Bus Services. This helped to dramatically reduce the workload of Aldenham, with London Country establishing its own overhaul facility at Tinsley Green near Crawley. With NBC in control, its vehicle purchases included more off the peg rear engined buses to replace London Transport standard RTs and Routemasters. Aldenham was also used to prepare new buses for service, and they would be delivered to the works for preparation. Major accident repairs would also take place at Aldenham if the local garage could not handle the work in question. Typical of this would be the replacement of a top deck lost in collisions with low bridges. Staff at Aldenham were transported in by bus, with buses running from over forty London bus garages every day. The fleet included redundant RTs and later used ex-British Airways front entrance RMA vehicles. =Decline= As financial pressures led to a decline in bus maintenance standards, the scope for overhaul of vehicles was reduced. London Transport's Bus Works Restructuring Programme 1983-4 was followed in October 1985 by the decision to discontinue the practice of completely overhauling each bus every four or five years. This, a shrinking fleet and the arrival of numerous types of non-standard bus not suited to the Aldenham concept made it increasingly uneconomic, and closure in November 1986 was inevitable.Newsbrief Commercial Motor 7 June 1986 Indeed, by this time, the very existence of London Transport as a bus operator was under review, with private sector operation under competitive tender eroding its domination. Bus overhaul was moved to Chiswick Works on a much smaller scale, then taken over by a short- lived private company called BEL (Bus Engineering Limited).BEL's workshop relaunched Commercial Motor 15 November 1986 The site was acquired by property developer Slough Estates and stood mostly empty except for occasional storage of cars on the vast site until being demolished in July 1996 to make way for the Centennial Park Business Park. Aldenham was an ambitious concept, even in its early days and never worked to its full capacity (part of the works site was leased to British Leyland as a repair and spares storage centre). The cessation of overhaul of buses by Aldenham became evident in an increasingly shabby fleet, not helped by the upheaval in London Transport prior to privatisation of the bus services. The much reduced maintenance also resulted in shorter service life with fleet renewals becoming much more frequent. On film Aldenham was the subject of much film time, including a 1957 British Transport film, entitled \\"Overhaul\\", about the work taking place at Aldenham. In 1962, the opening ten-minute scene of Cliff Richard's musical film Summer Holiday was filmed at the Aldenham Works, and Cliff's character and friends are all supposed to be mechanics at Aldenham works. Whilst on lunch on a rainy day, they come up with the idea of converting an RT bus into a mobile home and the next 5 minutes shows them at work to the track Seven Days to a Holiday. These scenes were all shot in the works during the summer shutdown, and employees were used as genuine extras. One shot even shows Cliff on an RT suspended from the crane above the works. The last film of the derelict works took place in 1992 for the BBC series Perpetual Motion which featured the story of the AEC Routemaster and widely on the changes at London Transport. The episode featured excerpts from \\"Overhaul\\", and later repeated the shots this time of the derelict works with the original voiceover dubbed onto the footage. Access to the site after closure was difficult, and few images exist of the site after closure.

Washington Education Association, 551 U.S. 177 (2007), is a ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that it does not violate the First Amendment for a state to require its public- sector unions to receive affirmative authorization from a non-member before spending that nonmember's agency fees for election-related purposes. Background of the case The National Labor Relations Act, as amended, allows unions to require that non-union members pay agency fees to cover collective bargaining costs and prevent free rider problems. The Supreme Court has ruled in a number of cases that requiring non-members to pay agency fees is both constitutional and legal, provided a number of conditions are met. In Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956).Kearney, Richard C. and Carnevale, David G. Labor Relations in the Public Sector. 3rd ed. New York: CRC Press, 2001. Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956). the Court held that the agency shop provisions of the Railway Labor Act were constitutional,Kohler, Thomas C. \\"Setting the Conditions for Self-Rule: Unions, Associations, Our First Amendment Discourse and the Problem of DeBartolo.\\" Wisconsin Law Review. 1990:149 (January 1990/February 1990). but withheld judgment as to \\"the validity or enforceability of a union or closed shop agreement if other conditions of union membership are imposed or if the exaction of dues, initiation fees or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First or the Fifth Amendment.\\"Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225, 238. Five years later, in Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740 (1961), the Court held that the Railway Labor Act \\"denies the authority to a union, over the employee's objection, to spend his money for political causes which he opposes.\\"Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 749. The high court also confronted the issue of remedy (how can non-members challenge the calculation of agency fees) in Machinists v. Street, and outlined several options which unions and employers might adopt (as well as rejecting remedies which the district court in the case had chosen).Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740, 771-775. Making its first private sector ruling in NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963), the Court held that agency fees equal to dues are not prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act.NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963).Canfield, Jeff. \\"Note: What A Sham(e): The Broken Becks Rights System in the Real World Workplace.\\" Wayne Law Review. 47:1049 (Fall 2001). Nonetheless, in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746 (1963), the Court questioned whether an agency fee set at a level equal to member dues was unfair because it set collective bargaining fees higher for non-members than for members.\\"...if nonmember payments, equal to those of a member, go entirely for collective bargaining costs, the nonmember will pay more of these expenses than his pro rata share. The member will pay less and to that extent a portion of his fees and dues is available to pay institutional expenses. The union's budget is balanced. By paying a larger share of collective bargaining costs the nonmember subsidizes the union's institutional activities. Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746, 754. After reargument, however, the Court in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96 (1963), did not reach the issue again and instead decided the case on narrow procedural grounds (concluding that Florida's right-to-work law outlawed the union shop provision at issue).Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96 (1963).Twomey, David. Labor and Employment Law: Text & Cases. 14th ed. Florence, Ky.: Cengage Learning, 2009. The Court further elaborated on the issue of remedies in Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113 (1963), allowing agency fee payers to opt out of all political expenditures rather than enunciate specific examples, but refusing to allow non-members to act as a class.Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113 (1963). The Supreme Court extended its constitutional and equity analysis to public employees in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977) (since overturned in 2018, see Janus v. AFSCME), holding that, where public employee collective bargaining exists and agency fee clauses are clearly authorized by law, public employee agency fee mechanisms also are constitutional.Carelli, Richard. \\"Ruling Eases Non- Union Dues Payments.\\" Associated Press. June 29, 1988.Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977). In Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), the Supreme Court concluded that the agency fee may only cover those activities directly related to the union's role as a collective bargaining representative. These included national conventions (where dues levels were set and union programs debated and established), social activities (which enhanced union solidarity, especially during negotiations), grievance handling, contract negotiation costs, and union communications, but excluded union organizing activities.Perl, Peter. \\"The Case of the Reluctant Union Contributor.\\" Washington Post. November 2, 1984.Belman, Dale; Gunderson, Morley; and Hyatt, Douglas. Public Sector Employment in a Time of Transition. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1996. Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984) The Court in Ellis also wrestled with the issue of rebates, and concluded that a union could not simply rebate agency fees to workers for that would essentially constitute a forced, interest-free loan from the worker to the union. In 1985, the Court held in Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95, that a union member may resign at any time without notice.Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95 (1985). Pattern Makers further undermined the union shop by giving workers the right to resign from the union at any time and incur no penalty (such as termination). The Court also crafted additional rules regarding agency fees in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986). In Teachers, the union had failed to minimize the risk that agency fees might be used for impermissible purposes and had failed to provide agency fee payers with adequate information about how the agency fee was calculated.Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292, 304-309. Now the Supreme Court imposed a third requirement, that agency fee payers must be offered a timely, fair, and objective mechanism for challenging the computation of agency fees. The Court did uphold, however, the use of interest-bearing escrow accounts for holding disputed dues.Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292, 309-310. In 1992, voters in the state of Washington approved a ballot initiative that requires unions to receive permission from non-union members to use their fees to support political campaigns.Kochkodin, Michael C. \\"Comment: A Good Politician Is One That Stays Bought: An Examination of Paycheck Protection Acts & Their Impact on Union Political Campaign Spending.\\" University of Pennsylvania Journal of Labor and Employment Law. 2:807 (Spring 2000). This included getting each person's approval even for soft money expenditures, an issue not previously covered in Supreme Court rulings. Gary Davenport, a non-union member and state worker, and other state employees sued, contending that the union failed to secure their approval before spending their agency fees on political efforts. A lawsuit was filed against the Washington Education Association by Washington Attorney General Christine Gregoire. The Thurston County, Washington Superior Court ruled that the union had to pay $590,375 in fines for intentionally violating the Washington statute. On appeal, the Washington Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that section 760 of the Washington Fair Campaign Practices Act had violated the First Amendment of the Constitution by placing the speech of union members as more valuable than teachers. However, the case was then appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the union stating that the law was unconstitutional because it placed too large of an administrative burden on the union. Therefore, non-union members could not prevent the union from using their money for political campaign purposes. In 2006, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral argument was held on January 10, 2007 and the Court reached a decision on June 14, 2007.Davenport v. Washington Education Association, 551 U.S. 177. The court's decision Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the decision for a unanimous Court, and overturned the previous Washington Supreme Court's ruling. Justice Scalia outlined two reasons why the Court believed that the Washington statute was constitutional: =Breyer's concurrence= In a concurring opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer agreed with all aspects of Justice Scalia's opinion except for the respondent's arguments that had not been raised in lower courts. This criticism is one of procedure and not content. Justice Breyer believed that the lower courts should have addressed these arguments before they were heard by the Supreme Court. Impact The Davenport ruling was moot the moment it was issued, for the Washington state legislature had, before the ruling was handed down, changed the law to make it far easier for unions to comply with its provisions.Himebaugh, Daniel A. \\"Consider the Source: A Note on Public-Sector Union Expenditure Restrictions Upheld in Davenport v. Washington Education Association.\\" Journal of the National Association of Administrative Law Judiciary. 28:533 (Fall 2008). Nonetheless, legal scholars have been highly critical of the Supreme Court's ruling in Davenport. As one legal scholar (who is highly critical of the agency fee), has said, \\"Correctly understood, this decision promises little and delivers even less because it fails to deal decisively and comprehensively with the issues that both earlier private sector and public sector union dues disputes illuminated but failed to settle.\\"Hutchison, Harry G. \\"Reclaiming the Union Movement Through Union Dues? A Postmodern Perspective in the Mirror of Public Choice Theory.\\" University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform. 33:447 (2000). (Footnotes omitted) Other legal scholars have criticized Justice Scalia's judicial reasoning in Davenport, concluding that he should have ruled solely on First Amendment grounds and overturned the agency fee law entirely.Jaffe, Erik S. \\"Campaign Finance and Free Speech: When Easy Cases Make Bad Law: Davenport v.

History The Big Hall during a charity concert in 2008 The decision to build a new multifunctional hall in Zagreb was made in 1957. A team of architects led by Marijan Haberle won the design contest. The construction began in 1961, but flooding and financial difficulties pushed the completion date into the next decade. The hall was finally opened on 29 December 1973. The concert hall has organized a number of concerts by musicians of all genres; it serves as the stage for classical music, opera, ballet and theater performances, as well as many international congresses and conventions. The hall saw 10 million visitors in the first thirty years of operation. In 2007, a total of 450 different shows were put together, recording over 760,000 visitors. Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall was the venue of the 1990 Eurovision Song Contest, after its first major renovation in 1989. In 1992, the hall's copper roof cover was completely replaced.

He was born in St Andrew's parish, Chichester, Sussex, and baptized there on 8 November 1574, third of four known children of Elizabeth and William Bullokar. Staunch Roman Catholics, the William Bullokar family was forced to move and was excommunicated on several occasions. The second son, Thomas Bullokar (also known as John Baptist Martyr) became a Franciscan and, in 1642, was hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn for celebrating mass. John Bullokar, presumably because of his religion, obtained his medical degree away from England, at Caen, France, on 16 October 1612. John Bullokar was the author of \\"An English Expositor: Teaching the Interpretation of the Hardest Words Used in our Language\\" (1616) and \\"A True Description of the Passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ, a poem in six-line stanzas\\" (1622). For his contribution to the development of the English dictionary, John Bullokar is recognized by linguists and lexicographers.

It is, arguably, the biggest market for used automotive and industrial spare parts in India. Many traders from all over India come here to sell or purchase old auto parts. Many small workshops specialised in different metals are active in the Mayapuri area. The safety of the scrap yards became a concern after the radiological accident which occurred in April 2010. The area is not equipped with radiation detectors or portics, despite being a common practice in steel recycling factories in the US and in most of the European countries.

He held the seat at Stafford until 1712 when he was raised to the peerage, as one of 12 peers created on the recommendation of the Lord Treasurer, the Earl of Oxford, to give him a majority in the House of Lords. Business When the lease of ironworks at Wilden and Shelsley Walsh expired in 1708, Foley took them in hand and they were operated as an estate enterprise by him and successive owners of the estate until 1776.The evidence for this is principally that he and his successors purchased pig iron from the blast furnaces of others, and their names thus appear in the furnace accounts. Foley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1696. Family Foley married Mary Strode with whom he fathered seven children, five of them predeceasing their parents. His only surviving son was Thomas Foley, 2nd Baron Foley, after whose death the title became extinct, while the estates devolved upon the latter's distant cousin Thomas Foley of Stoke Edith, Herefordshire, for whom the title was revived in 1776.

He took part in the World Heavyweight Championship and was one of the three most famous Estonian professional wrestlers, along with Georg Lurich and Georg Hackenschmidt. Biography Aberg was born in Kolga Manor, Harju County, Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire. He was of Estonian origin. He wrestled in North America (1913‚Äì14 and 1915‚Äì16) with mixed success. Together with Lurich he came back via Japan and China to Russia in 1917 and arrived in Estonia in autumn. They participated in a wrestling tournament in Tallinn that remained unfinished due to the approach of the German troops. The athletes went to Saint Petersburg and on to South Russia. The war meant an end to work in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. As the war spread, the men had to move further inside Russia. They could stop only in a far corner of South Russia, Armavir, Kuban Oblast. Their aim was to leave Russia across the Black Sea by boat. The front reached them in 1920 and Armavir passed from hand to hand in battles several times, many perished. Warm winter brought on typhoid. Due to the war, medical aid was difficult to get. Lurich fell ill first and could not be rescued, dying on 22 January 1920. Aberg had also become infected but he managed to defeat the illness. Unfortunately he rushed his recovery, caught pneumonia, and died on February 15, 1920, in Armavir.

Its main feature is a deep freshwater pond, but the surrounding area contains a variety of habitats that provides shelter for over 140 species of birds and other wildlife. The pond occupies the site of a former open-cast coal mine. It was leased in 1951 by one Joe Wilson, who began to manage it for wildlife and from whom the site derives its name. It was purchased in 1970 by the Durham Wildlife Trust, which manages it in conjunction with the adjoining Rainton Meadows nature reserve. The site actually consists of three ponds: the smallest (the \\"Balancing Pond\\") helps to prevent pollution of the main pond by trapping seepage from adjacent coal waste tips; another, slightly larger pond (the \\"Overflow Pond\\") is used to control the water level in the main pond, to which it is linked via a sluice gate. The site is located to the north of East Rainton and to the south of Chilton Moor. It is easily accessed from the A690. Joe's Pond is an excellent bird watching site, with over 140 species to be seen, including wintering common teal, common pochard, and tufted duck, and, in summer, great crested grebes. The surrounding scrub areas host large winter flocks of thrushes and all five species of owl are regularly seen.http://www.sunderland.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=8014 References * Durham Wildlife Trust Website * BBC Tyne Website Parks and open spaces in Tyne and Wear Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Tyne and Wear Nature reserves of the Durham Wildlife Trust ","title":"Joe's Pond"},{"id":"16056430","text":"West Rock is an unincorporated community in Royalton Township, Pine County, Minnesota, United States.

Early and family life Born in Botetourt County, Virginia in 1842, Anderson was the son of lawyer Francis T. Anderson, who by 1855 had moved his family to Lexington in Rockbridge County, Virginia to become rector of his alma mater, Washington College (that became Washington & Lee University in his lifetime). He was named for his paternal grandfather, who had represented Botetourt County in the 1831-1832 legislative session.Leonard p. 359 His maternal grandfather was Andrew Alexander, whose ancestor Archibald Alexander emigrated from County Antrim, Ireland and settled near Augusta in Rockbridge County in 1747.Tyler vol. III, p. 3 Young William Anderson received a private education suitable to his class. He was enrolled at Washington College in Lexington when Virginia seceded in May 1861. He married twice and had five children. His first wife, Ellen. G. Anderson of Richmond, died in 1872. His second wife was Mary Louisa Blair of Lexington.Tyler vol. III, p. 5 Confederate soldier and aftermath By the following month, Anderson had enlisted in the Confederate Army, having joined the \\"Liberty Hall Volunteers,\\" a group of Washington College students and alumni, who became part of the Fourth Virginia Infantry Regiment under the command of former Virginia Military Institute professor Stonewall Jackson. A bullet shattered Anderson's kneecap at the Battle of First Manassas on July 21, and he was mustered out for disability by September 13, 1861. However, he joined a temporary artillery company in albemarle County, composed of other disabled veterans, and briefly returned to fight against Union General Hunter.Tyler Vol. III, p. 3 Meanwhile, his father had been elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1861, but ill-health caused F.T. Anderson to decline a re-election campaign, though a decade later he had recovered enough to accept a position on the Virginia Supreme Court. During the war, the disabled younger Anderson completed his education, and continued in his father's career path following the conflict, by attending the University of Virginia Law School and graduating in 1866. Lawyer and politician A member of the state executive committee of the Democratic Party for many years, Anderson first won election to the Senate of Virginia, representing Rockbridge, Bath and Alleghany counties (part-time) for single term, from 1869 to 1873.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 512, 516 \\"In 1870, Anderson was credited with introducing the bill establishing the public school system of Virginia as put forth by Dr. William Henry Ruffner.\\" Nearly a decade later, Rockbridge County voters elected Anderson one of their representatives (also part-time), in the Virginia House of Delegates, so from 1883 to 1885 he served alongside Matthew W. Paxton (of a family which had previously sent other members to the House of Delegates), but voters refused to re-elect either man, replacing them with Charles F. Jordan and Jacob W. Arnold in 1885, whose terms also proved solitary. Rockbridge voters again elected Anderson (this time alongside John T. McKee) to serve in the 1887 assembly, before again refusing to re-elect either man, but instead replacing them with Greenlee D. Letcher and James M. Johnston (only the former winning re-election).Leonard, pp. 539, 547 Anderson became one of the principal authors of the Anderson-McCormick Election Act (allowing the General Assembly to elect 3-member boards of election in each county) that in combination with the Walton Act (which required use of the secret ballot as well as that voters cross out three fourths of the name of every candidate the voter voted against), reduced the number of Black Virginians eligible to vote, as well as the number of Black officeholders.Brent Tarter, The Grandees of Government (University of Virginia Press, 2013) p. 264 In 1899, Anderson became president of the Virginia Bar Association, and made disenfranchisement of African Americans the subject of his presidential address.Tarter p. 266 He soon had an opportunity to place his ideas into practice, as Rockbridge and Buena Vista County voters elected Anderson and J.W. Gilmore to represent them in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1901-1902.Leonard p. 575 Anderson became one of the convention's key members, in part because he came prepared with methods used by other Southern states to circumvent the Fifteenth Amendment's prohibition against denying men the right to vote based on their race or previous condition of servitude.Brent Tarter, The Grandees of Government (University of Virginia Press 2013) p. 265, citing Report of the Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention State of Virginia Held in the City of Richmond June 12, 1901 to June 26, 1902, pp. 19-20 Anderson served as chairman of the convention's revision committee, as well as president pro tempore of the convention as a whole (in the absence of its President, fellow lawyer, former Confederate and Congressman John Goode Jr.)], and also won election as the Commonwealth's Attorney General during the convention. Despite pre-convention promises that voters would have a choice of ratifying the final document, a 47 to 38 majority of the convention's delegates voted to proclaim it as in effect as of July 10, 1902, and never submitted it to voters. When a man convicted of housebreaking in Augusta County complained that his trial for a felony without a jury was defective, Attorney General Anderson defended the conviction before the Virginia Supreme Court, and Justice George Moffett Harrison pronounced the new constitution valid, since it was accepted by the governor and legislature and all judges took oaths to support it.Taylor v. Commonwealth, 101 Va. 829 (1903), available at https://cite.case.law/va/101/829/ Federal appellate judges also refused to invalidate that new constitution. They relied upon a South Carolina constitutional convention case, Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651 (1895) and U.S. Supreme Court justice David Josiah Brewer took judicial notice that the U.S. House of Representatives had seated the congressmen elected by Virginia voters that year and \\"the thing sought to be prohibited has been done and cannot be undone by order of court\\".Tarter p. 270 citing Jones v. Montague, 194 U.S. Reports 147-153 (1904)(quotation on p. 153) and Selden v. Montague, 194 U.S. Reports 153 (1904) The underlying federal case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia had been brought on behalf of voters in Virginia's 3rd congressional district by lawyer John S. Wise, likewise a former Confederate as well as former U.S. Congressman (but aligned with the Readjuster Party rather than the Democrats), against Virginia's Governor Andrew Jackson Montague as well as the Secretary of the Commonwealth and the Auditor of Public Accounts, and had sought a writ of prohibition against counting the November 1902 election returns and also complained that the party in power sought to disenfranchise colored voters.Justice Brewer opinion in Jones v. Montague, available on wikisource By the 1904 election, fifty percent fewer white, and ninety percent fewer black men voted.Tarter p. 268 Virginia voters re-elected Anderson Attorney General of Virginia in 1905. He and other lawyers also represented Virginia in its suit against West Virginia in the United States Supreme Court, to recover a share of Virginia's public debt as of 1861.Virginia v. West Virginia, 220 U.S. 1 (1911). The case was argued January 20, 23, 24, 25, and 26, 1911, with Anderson, Samuel W. Williams, Randolph Harrison, and John B. Moon appearing for the Commonwealth. When the case ended in 1920, the special commissioner recommended awarding attorneys fees to Anderson of $75,000. Anderson also served on the state board of education after finishing his term as attorney general.Tyler Vol. III, p. 4 He would win his final election to the House of Delegates in 1917, and represented part of Rockbridge county as well and neighboring Buena Vista county in the 1918 and 1919 sessions (John W. Stephenson representing the rest of Rockbridge and Buena Vista counties, together with Bath and Highland counties).Leonard p. 614 Anderson served on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater,Washington & Lee from 1885 to 1930, and also followed his father's path by serving as its rector from 1913 to 1924. Death and legacy Anderson was buried in the Stonewall Jackson Cemetery in Lexington, Virginia.

His parents were Alvin Enke and Mae Nichols. He graduated from Central High School in Minneapolis in 1951. He received a BA degree from Principia College in 1955 and a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1959. His thesis, concerning the anodic formation of surface oxide films on platinum electrodes, was performed under the guidance of Herbert Laitinen. While at Illinois, he also worked with Howard Malmstadt to introduce a graduate lab and lecture course in the electronics of laboratory instrumentation. He is now Professor Emeriti of Chemistry at the University of New Mexico and Michigan State University. Prior to his move to the University of New Mexico in 1994, he was an instructor and assistant professor at Princeton (1959 ‚Äì1966), then an associate professor and professor at Michigan State University.

Then Malmstadt, Stan Crouch, and Enke wrote eight more texts and lab books in the electronics of laboratory instrumentation. This same team developed and presented the hands-on ACS short course, Electronics for Laboratory Instrumentation beginning in 1979. Enke also wrote an introductory analytical chemistry text called The Art and Science of Chemical Analysis. *Mass spectrometry: Enke, his graduate student, Rick Yost, and a colleague, James Morrison, discovered low-energy collisional ion fragmentation in 1979. Collisional dissociation in an RF-only quadrupole mass filter between two quadrupole mass analyzers resulted in the first triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Its low cost and unit resolution ushered in the technique now known as tandem mass spectrometry. Enke continued research in mass spectrometry including developing a distributed microprocessor control system for the triple-quadrupole, a fast integrating detector system for time- of-flight mass spectrometry, development of a tandem time-of-flight instrument with photofragmentation of ions, the equilibrium partition theory of electrospray ionization, and the invention of distance-of-flight mass spectrometry. *Comprehensive analysis of complex mixtures: With Luc Nagels, Enke discovered that the concentrations of components in many natural complex mixtures have a log-normal distribution. With this information, one can learn the number and concentrations of components that are below the detection limit.

According to the organisation, residents of Parkstad Limburg experience severe noise nuisance from low-flying AWACS aircraft. Noise measurements carried out by the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment showed that most AWACS flights produce noise levels of 100 db(A) or higher. Had the aircraft in question been civil Boeing 707s, there would have been a clear breach of European standards.Noise from military aircraft (AWACS) European Court of Human Rights On 22 January 2008, sympathisers of the Vereniging STOP awacs made a complaint against the Dutch state to the European Court of Human Rights alleging an infringement of several articles of the European Convention on Human Rights,Article 2: right to life; Article 3: prohibition of torture; Article 6: right to a fair trial; Article 8: right to respect for private life; Article 13: right to an effective remedy in deciding to cut down the forest on the border.

Campus  LCB Pittsburgh provided industry-style kitchens for student training. The facilities included a skill development kitchen; a stock, soup and sauce kitchen; a meat and poultry kitchen; a seafood/charcuterie kitchen; a pastry kitchen; a garde manger/classical/international cuisine kitchen; and multipurpose kitchens. The p√¢tisserie and baking kitchens included an American-style bakery kitchen, artisan bread kitchen, European-style pastry kitchen, cold and frozen dessert specialty kitchen, and a chocolate, candy and artistic sculpturing kitchen. Closing On January 18, 2011, LCB Pittsburgh announced that it would no longer be accepting students, as the school is to be closing. The closing was the result of a combination of events, including the end of the school's lease and political pressure by the Obama administration and Senate Democrats on Career Education Corporation as a for-profit school. (The Department of Education's proposed \\"gainful employment\\" rule would deny federal funding to schools with graduates facing high proportions of debt related to their expected salaries.) Current students were allowed to finish their programs before the school closed its doors at the end of 2012.

The authors discovered that when Social Security was implemented in the United States, the Catholic Church opted out for nuns. This has since changed and social security is in place. However, the raising of funds for the local monastery is always offered to each presenting organization. If the offering is taken at the end of the performance, the actresses encourage everyone in the audience to give generously. As of December 2012, the Late Nite Catechism franchise had collected over two million dollars for retired Sisters. Donovan originated the role of Sister. For her work in Late Nite Catechism, she was nominated for the Outer Critics Circle Award in New York for outstanding solo performance. She was also nominated for two Los Angeles Drama Critic Circle Awards for writing and performance, and won the LADCC for Best Solo Performance in 1999. Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Quade wrote the original 60-page draft in three weeks, and over time the authors revised the material. Quade produced the show in Chicago, and in 2000, was nominated for a Los Angeles Drama Circle Critics Award.

In 2011 Entertainment Events, Inc. prevailed in arbitration proceedings with Quade. The company claimed breach of contract and copyright infringement, over a 1995 licensing agreement. Under the ruling, Vicki Quade is not permitted to produce Late Nite Catechism or her sequels outside of her Chicago territory - a 50-mile radius. This prohibition applies even if the character in the sequels is called \\"Mother Superior.\\" In addition the arbitrator has awarded Entertainment Events, Inc. with damages sought. Also in 2011, Vicki Quade prevailed in a lawsuit against Maripat Donovan in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois over issues involving copyright and royalty compensation. In a 59-page opinion, Judge Nan Nolan ruled that Donovan usurped the corporate opportunity of Quade/Donovan Entertainment by producing Late Nite Catechism in California and Chicago through Donovan Entertainment, Inc.

She is the author of The Most Famous Man in America: The Biography of Henry Ward Beecher, for which she won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Born in Eugene, Oregon, Applegate attended Amherst College as an undergraduate, where she began a two-decade fascination with famous alumnus Henry Ward Beecher, a 19th-century abolitionist minister who was later the subject of a widely publicized sex scandal. She made Beecher the subject of her dissertation in American Studies at Yale, where she received a Ph.D. After several more years of research, Applegate published The Most Famous Man in America, which was praised by critics and awarded the Pulitzer Prize. She has announced that her second book will be a biography of New York City brothel-keeper Polly Adler. Biography Born in Eugene, Oregon, Applegate grew up in Clackamas, Oregon, graduating from Clackamas High School.Pulitzer-prize winning author has Eastern Oregon ties, East Oregonian, May 9, 2007. She was raised in what she described as an \\"unusual religious environment\\": her mother, from a Mormon family, became a New Thought minister, while her father was an Irish Catholic. She graduated summa cum laude from Amherst College in 1989 and was a Sterling Fellow at Yale University, where she earned a Ph.D. in American Studies. Applegate has taught at Yale, Wesleyan University, and Marymount Manhattan College.About the Author. The Most Famous Man in America. Accessed June 8, 2013. Her contributions have appeared in The Journal of American History and The New York Times. Applegate was a founding member of Biographers International Organization (BIO), and served as its initial interim president in 2009. She currently serves as the Chair of BIO's Advisory Committee. She is married to Bruce Tulgan, a business writer whose books include It's Okay To Be The Boss. They live in New Haven, Connecticut.  The Most Famous Man in America  As an undergraduate student worker at Amherst College, Applegate was assigned to assemble an exhibit on a famous alumnus and selected Henry Ward Beecher, a 19th-century minister known for his abolitionist preaching and widely publicized sex scandal. Applegate described him as \\" unlike any religious figure I‚Äôd ever seen. I loved his very modern sense of humor, his irreverence, and his joyful, ecumenical approach to religion and life in general.\\" She later made him the subject of her undergraduate senior thesis and her PhD dissertation at Yale University. After graduation, Applegate signed a publishing contract to write a biography of Beecher. \\"I had acquired an excellent education as an academic historian, but I‚Äôd never had a single lesson, formal or informal, in this new craft I had so blithely chosen,\\" Applegate later recalled. Applegate's initial chapters were written in what she considered an overly academic voice, so to write a biography with popular appeal, she studied fiction writing, including techniques for suspense and pornographic writing. \\"I made my way through my first book by trial and error, using my cobbled-together collection of examples, borrowed exercises and jerry-rigged postulations, to navigate the enormous task of fashioning an intellectually and emotionally compelling account out of the scattered detritus of a person‚Äôs life,\\" wrote Applegate in a 2016 essay on making the leap from academic historian to popular biographer.Debby Applegate, \\"From Academic Historian to Popular Biographer: Musings on the Practical Poetics of Biography,\\" in The Biographical Turn: Lives in History, Hans Renders, Binne de Haan, Jonne Harmsma, eds. (Routledge, 2016). She structured the resulting book as a psychological thriller. Though she had originally hoped to publish the book during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, in which US President Bill Clinton was discovered to have had a sexual relationship with a White House intern, the research took several years longer than she had initially planned. The book was finally released in 2006 by Doubleday. = Reception = The Most Famous Man in America was sold well and was praised by critics. NPR selected it as one of the year's best nonfiction books, stating that the book \\"convinces readers of the truth of that swaggering title\\". Kirkus Reviews called it a \\"beautifully written biography of America's one best-known preacher ... An exceptionally thorough and thoughtful account of a spectacular career that helped shape and reflect national preoccupations before, during and after the Civil War.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote that \\"this assessment of Beecher is judicious and critical. Applegate gives an insightful account.\\" In a review for The Boston Globe, Katherine A. Powers called the book a \\"fantastic story with novelistic flair and penetration into the ever-changing motives and expediencies of its many actors.\\" Michael Kazin, reviewing the book for The New York Times, stated that Applegate's writing occasionally \\"loses its force in a thicket of personal details\\", but concluded that the book is \\"a biography worthy of its subject\\". On April 16, 2007, the book was announced as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Applegate said of her win, \\"Half of it is just good luck ... Had it come out four years ago, I don't think the climate was ready for it. The religious right intersection with politics is very important now.\\"  Madam: The Notorious Life and Times of Polly Adler  As of 2011, Applegate was working on a biography of Polly Adler, New York City's notorious Prohibition-era brothel-keeper whose 1953 memoir A House is Not a Home became a New York Times Bestseller and a 1963 film starring Shelley Winters. The decision to write the book came after a year of research into 1920s New York City cultural history, during which Applegate discovered Adler's memoir and grew fascinated by it.\\"Innocently strolling the library stacks, I stumbled upon yet another big, bewitching American character ‚Äî a once infamous but now forgotten madam named Polly Adler,\\" wrote Applegate in an essay honoring the centennial of the Pulitzer Prizes. \\"Before I knew it, I‚Äôd signed another contract and marched back into the swamp.\\" Applegate's book is to be titled Madam: The Notorious Life and Times of Polly Adler and will be published by Doubleday.

Its area of coverage extended from New York City to the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Mission The air station's missions included search and rescue, law enforcement, counting migratory waterfowl for the U.S. Biological Survey, and assisting icebound islands by delivering provisions. During World War II anti- submarine patrols were also conducted from the air station. History With little room to expand at Coast Guard Aviation Station Ten Pound Island in Gloucester, a new air station was established at Salem in 1935. CGAS Salem was built with a barracks, hangar, an apron, and a seaplane ramp; it never had facilities for fixed-wing landplanes. The station was built on Winter Island, on land adjacent to the War of 1812 vintage Fort Pickering, and on or near the site of the construction of the sail frigate by one of Enos Briggs' shipyards in 1799.The Salem Frigate at Salem.comEnos Briggs at SalemWeb.com The station performed 26 medevac missions in its first year of operation. During World War II anti-submarine patrols were conducted from the air station. In October 1944 the station was the first on the eastern seaboard to be designated as part of the Air-Sea Rescue Service. In 1950, Air Detachment Quonset Point, Rhode Island was established as a sub unit of Air Station Salem. During the 1950s, helicopters were introduced with a great deal of success as a rescue platform. With the development circa 1960 of the Sikorsky HH-52A, an amphibious helicopter, the need for flying boats was lessened. The US Navy retired its last seaplane, the P5M Marlin, in 1967.*Roberts, Michael D.

Located in the Altos Cordillera, it is part of the Cordillera Department. Original name and founding Atyr√°, initially named Atyh√°, was founded by the governor Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala in 1538. The word \\"Atyh√°\\" is of Guaran√≠ origin. It used to be a Guaran√≠ village, and was named for being the meeting place of its residents. Geography A street of the city Located in the Altos Cordillera, the landscape of the city has large extensions of rocks that form undulations. It is bounded to the north by the city of Arroyos y Esteros, to the north-east by Loma Grande District, to the south by Tobat√≠, to the west by the Altos, and to the south-east by San Bernardino and Ypacarai. Climate The climate is mild and dry. The average temperature is 22¬∞C, reaching 39¬∞C in the summer, and in winter dropping to 3¬∞C. Demography Atyr√° has a population of 15,278 inhabitants, 8,004 men and 7,274 women, according to the projections of the national Statistics, Polls and Census General Direction (2008). The population density is 70 inhabitants per kilometer. Neighborhoods and districts Permanent exposition of artisans Most of the housing in Atyra is modern, but a few houses are left that date from the 19th century, showing the architecture and details of the typical constructions of the Colonial period, including houses with ceilings of hay and surrounded by trees and palms typical of the area. The city is divided into an urban and a rural area. In the urban area the neighborhoods are: * San Antonio * San Bl√°s * Las Mercedes * Mar√≠a Auxiliadora In the rural area are these localities: * Candia * San Vicente * Gral. Bernardino Caballero * Zanja h√∫ * Comandante Ojeda * Caacupem√≠ * Tacuaty * Mburur√∫ * Candia Loma * Catumbey * Caugu√° * Potrero * Monte Alto History The governor Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala founded the city in 1539. The act of foundation was made under the shadow of three Yvapov√≥ plants, in a place that the natives used as a place of meeting, and from this came the name \\"Atyh√°\\" that finally became \\"Atyr√°\\". In 1580, Franciscan missionaries led by Alonso de San Buenaventura and Fray Luis de Bola√±os, made the religious foundation of the localities: Altos, Atyr√°, Tobat√≠ and Yaguar√≥n.  Church of Atyr√°  Church of Atyr√° The church of Atyr√° is nowadays a museum of sacred art that exhibits carvings in wood made by the natives since 1580, with a Baroque Hispano-Guaran√≠ style. The building of the church started around 1782, impelled by the priest Father Almada, who also encouraged the population of the city to develop some mechanical and artisan abilities. The church building was remodeled in 1852 by command of the President of Paraguay at that time, Carlos Antonio L√≥pez. It was replaced in 1928 with the building that still stands today. Since that time, the town developed and grew around the church, as was traditional with most of the towns in Paraguay throughout its history. Three of the four walls of the building served as the start of the new construction, and the wall that faces southeast does not present any sign of another edifice having been built. The church is not located in the epicenter of the city; it is actually displayed more like the perspective of an avenue, as if it was the beginning or the end of the city. In its interior, it retains the altar built in the 18th century and the statues that represent the Virgin of Sorrows, Saint Francis, Saint Luc√≠a, Virgin of Candelaria, Mar√≠a Auxiliadora, and Saint Catalina, among others, all created under the teaching of the Franciscan missionaries. Economy The population of the city works mostly in agriculture and cattle, and it also has coconut oil factories and sawmills. The people of the city also maintain the continuity of the artisan characteristics of the Colonial period, especially in saddlery. Arts and culture Artisan of wood This city is known for its artisan work in leather and fabric. Its artisans also work in the creation of wooden objects. Their production is displayed in a permanent market installed in the middle of the city. The religious holiday of Saint Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the city, is celebrated on October 4. Traditional culture A widely known story from Paraguayan folklore has its origin in Atyr√°: the story of the Indio Jos√©, who found himself trapped during a violent storm in the area and begged for help from the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception. He is said to have miraculously found a tree to climb on the Zanja H√∫ Hill, which saved his life. The Indio Jos√© had promised the Virgin to carve an image for her, so he did, and that same image is now part of the altar in the religious center of Paraguay, the Caacup√© Basilica. Artisan craftsmanship Artisan craftsmanship in leather Artisans' carving of wood is economically the second most important activity of the city. This artisan activity started in the colonial period, by the Franciscan missionaries. The usual themes for the carvings in wood include saints, legendary creatures, animals and others. Many families also practice leather work including bags, backpacks, shoes, belts, saddles, and others. Tourism The city has a \\"Casa de la Cultura\\" (House of Culture), which displays the work made by the artisans of the city. Atyr√° has a variety of fauna and flora, especially in the area of Zanja H√∫. It has several streams that are used for swimming and practicing water sports. Carumbey means \\"Turtle‚Äôs stream\\".

Biography Born in March 1923 in Burton-on-Trent, Robert Webster Ford was the son of Robert Ford, a brewery engine-driver, and Beatrice Ford, who lived on Church Road in Rolleston-on-Dove. He attended Rolleston Primary School and Burton-on- Trent Grammar School. As he did not relish the idea of spending the rest of his life in a bank or office in Burton-on-Trent and wanted to travel and see the world, he enlisted as an apprentice in the Royal Air Force when he left school at 16. In 1943, he was posted to India but soon became disillusioned, and jumped at the offer of a job as radio operator in Lhasa, Tibet, at the end of World War II.Robert Webster Ford.

In 1945, he joined the British Mission in Lhasa as a radio officer, to replace Reg Fox who had to return to India for medical reasons. He remained in Lhasa from 29 June to 29 September under the supervision of Hugh RichardsonJames Cooper, \\"Western and Japanese Visitors to Lhasa: 1900-1950\\", Tibet Journal, Winter 2003 and had an audience with the 14-year-old 14th Dalai Lama in Lhasa.

When India became independent in 1947, Robert Ford (after returning to the UK to be demobbed) returned to Lhasa in May 1948 and was appointed by the Government of Tibet, becoming the first foreigner to be given an official rank in the country. As Tibetans had a problem in pronouncing \\"F\\", \\"Ford\\" became Phodo (and later in Kham, he was to become known as Phodo Kusho, \\"Ford Esquire\\"). After one year in Lhasa, he was requested to go to Chamdo, capital of eastern Tibet (Kham), to establish a radio link between Lhasa and Chamdo. With three wireless operator students, he left Lhasa on 20 July 1949. They helped the Governor General of Kham, Lhalu Tsewang Dorje, improve defence in Chamdo and the surrounding area. In addition, a direct link was established for the first time between Lhasa and Chamdo. Early in 1950, Lhalu requested Ford shorten the training of the wireless operator students. By that time, new instructors had arrived to train soldiers in the use of Bren guns. Robert Ford wrote that \\"the Tibetan Army began to look a little less like something out of the Middle Ages.\\"The Dragon in the Land of Snows by Tsering Shakya. He was arrested in 1950 by the advancing Chinese army, along with the Governor General of Kham, Ngabo Ngawang Jigme, and other Tibetan officials.

Ford spent nearly 5 years in jail, in constant fear of being executed, and was subjected to interrogation and thought reform. Only in 1954 was he allowed to send a letter to his parents. At the end of 1954 his trial was held and he was sentenced to ten years jail. He was eventually released and expelled in 1955.Robert Webster Ford In 1957, he published the book Captured in Tibet (U.S. title Wind Between the Worlds) about his experience. The book was reissued in 1990 under the title with a preface by the Dalai Lama and an epilogue by the author entitled \\"The Occupation\\".

After his retirement, Ford lectured in support of the Tibetan Government in Exile in various countries (the UK, other European countries, Australia and the United States). In 1992, he undertook a countrywide lecture tour in India, at the request of the Dalai Lama. However, the tour was brought to an abrupt end when Ford was put under house arrest in Dharamsala by the Indian authorities as the lectures coincided with Chinese Premier Li Peng's official visit to India. Ford had to return to Britain earlier than expected.Thubten Samdup, UK Celebrate 90th Birthday of Robert Ford, Tibet's First Radio Operator, tibet.net, 23 March 2013.

In this city lived during the government of Dr. Francia, the founder and first dictator of Paraguay, in his exile for over 30 years, Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, the liberator of Uruguay. During the War against the Triple Alliance, the Marshall L√≥pez declared Curuguaty as his last and the 4th capital of Paraguay and the Vice- President Domingo Francisco S√°nchez Corval√°n settled in the place. L√≥pez settled his troops near Curuguaty on the banks of the Itandey Stream, when he was going towards the Amambay Cordillera, where the last battles would be fought during the war. Since the early years of the new millennium landless peasants fight for their land, which was in part at least given in the past decades to influential and wealthy men and women of the political upper classes of Paraguay.

The book describes Beecher's childhood, ministry, support for the abolition of slavery and other social causes, and widely publicized 1875 trial for adultery. Before publishing the book, Applegate researched and wrote about Beecher for twenty years, starting when she was an undergraduate student at Beecher's alma mater, Amherst College. The book was generally well received by critics. In 2007, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Background As an undergraduate student worker at Amherst College, Applegate was assigned to assemble an exhibit on a famous alumnus and selected Beecher. She later wrote about him for her undergraduate senior thesis and made him the subject of her PhD dissertation at Yale University. After graduation, Applegate signed a publishing contract for a biography of Beecher. To write a biography with popular appeal, Applegate studied fiction writing, including techniques for suspense and pornographic writing. She structured the resulting book as a psychological thriller. Though she had originally hoped to publish the book during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, in which US President Bill Clinton was discovered to have had a sexual relationship with a White House intern, the research took several years longer than she had initially planned. The book was finally released in 2006 by Doubleday and Three Leaves Press in hardback, paperback, and e-book editions. Contents Henry Ward Beecher, the book's subject The Most Famous Man in America follows the life of 19th-century American minister Henry Ward Beecher. Its introduction describes Beecher's speech at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, at the close of the American Civil War; Beecher was personally invited to speak by President Abraham Lincoln, who commented, \\"We had better send Beecher down to deliver the address on the occasion of the raising of the flag because if it had not been for Beecher there would have been no flag to raise\\". Applegate then retells Beecher's sometimes difficult childhood as the son of Lyman Beecher, himself a famous evangelist. Henry was initially overshadowed by his accomplished siblings, who included Harriet Beecher Stowe, later the author of the antislavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Henry discovered a gift for public speaking and went into the ministry, attending Amherst College and Lane Theological Seminary. He then served as a minister in Lawrenceburg, Indiana and Indianapolis before moving on to the richer post of the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn, New York. In New York, Beecher soon acquired fame on the lecture circuit for his novel oratorical style, in which he employed humor, dialect, and slang. Over the course of his ministry, he developed a theology emphasizing God's love above all else, in contrast to his father's stern Calvinism. He also grew interested in social reform, particularly the abolitionist movement. In the years leading up to the Civil War, he raised money to purchase slaves from captivity and to send rifles‚Äînicknamed \\"Beecher's Bibles\\"‚Äîto abolitionists fighting in Kansas and Nebraska. He toured Europe during the Civil War speaking in support of the Union. After the war, Beecher supported social reform causes such as women's suffrage and temperance. In the book's closing chapters, Applegate details Beecher's relationship with Elizabeth Richards Tilton, wife of his friend and associate Theodore Tilton, and its consequences. Elizabeth Tilton both confessed to and retracted her confession of an affair with Beecher; her husband later filed adultery charges against Beecher, resulting in one of the most widely reported American trials of the century. The jurors could not decide whom to believe, resulting in a hung jury. In assessing Beecher's legacy, Applegate states that > His reputation has been eclipsed by his own success. Mainstream Christianity > is so deeply infused with the rhetoric of Christ's love that most Americans > can imagine nothing else, and have no appreciation or memory of the > revolution wrought by Beecher and his peers. Applegate adds that it is hard not to consider Beecher's various affairs or near-affairs hypocritical, but compares him to other great leaders whose need for love and approval led them into sex scandals. Ultimately, Applegate concludes, Beecher was able \\"to transform his flaws into a powerful force of empathy and ambition\\" that \\"brought a new emotional candor to public life\\". Critical response Debby Applegate at Brooklyn Historical Society, 2006 The Most Famous Man in America was well received by critics. NPR selected it as one of the year's best nonfiction books, stating that the book \\"convinces readers of the truth of that swaggering title\\". Kirkus Reviews called it a \\"beautifully written biography of America's one best-known preacher ... An exceptionally thorough and thoughtful account of a spectacular career that helped shape and reflect national preoccupations before, during and after the Civil War.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote that \\"this assessment of Beecher is judicious and critical. Applegate gives an insightful account.\\" In a review for The Boston Globe, Katherine A. Powers called the book a \\"fantastic story with novelistic flair and penetration into the ever-changing motives and expediencies of its many actors.\\" Jon Meacham, reviewing for The Washington Post, called the book \\"illuminating and thorough\\". Michael Kazin, reviewing the book for The New York Times, stated that the book occasionally \\"loses its force in a thicket of personal details\\", but concluded that it is \\"a biography worthy of its subject\\". Deidre Donahue, writing in USA Today, also stated that the book had \\"sometimes excessive detail\\" but praised its \\"marvelous perspective\\". Ernest W. Lefever wrote in The Washington Times that \\"Applegate's fact-studded and fast-paced portrait of one of America's most famous preachers from one of America's most famous 19th-century families is a remarkably authentic mirror of the times\\", criticizing only the \\"minor flaw\\" of a lack of nuance in her description of Calvinism. Heather Cox Richardson praised the book in The Chicago Tribune, calling it \\"one of those rare books that delivers a great deal more than it promises\\"; though critical of what she saw as some factual errors and \\"unsubstantiated claims\\" by Applegate, such as Lyman Beecher's role in creating mass media, Richardson concluded that these flaws \\"do not cripple her story\\". On April 16, 2007, the book was announced as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. Applegate said of her win, \\"Half of it is just good luck ... Had it come out four years ago, I don't think the climate was ready for it. The religious right intersection with politics is very important now.\\"  Notes  =Citations= =References= * External links * The Most Famous Man in America (official website) 2006 non-fiction books American biographies Beecher family Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography-winning works Doubleday (publisher) books ","title":"The Most Famous Man in America"},{"id":"16056918","text":"Playing in the City is the first album by the Barratt Band.

The case is notable for the eventual admission into evidence of a letter written by the deceased prior to her death expressing suspicion of her husband's intentions. Julie Jensen investigated her husband, checked his planner, photographed a note, and documented her suspicions. She gave the letter to a neighbor with instructions to hand it to police if anything should happen to her. She wrote that she would never commit suicide and that if she died, police should consider her husband a suspect. \\"I pray that I am wrong and nothing happens, but I am suspicious of Mark's suspicious behaviors and fear for my early demise.\\" In 2008, Mark Jensen was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, a verdict which was later overturned. Background Julie Griffin was working at a Sears department store in Oshkosh when she met Mark Jensen in 1981. Both were students at a local college; Mark graduated but Julie did not. The couple moved to the Carol Beach neighborhood of Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin and had two children, David and Douglas, aged 8 and 3 at the time of Julie's death. Julie was described as having a complicated family life (her mother was an alcoholic and her younger brother died in an accident as a toddler), but was a devoted mother to her children. At the time of her death, Julie worked a part- time job for the Port Authority in Chicago, while Mark Jensen was employed at a construction firm. Trial Special Prosecutor Robert Jambois contended that Mark Jensen poisoned his wife Julie, then 40, with ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and then suffocated her inside the garage of their home in Pleasant Prairie on December 3, 1998. The trial was moved from Kenosha County to Walworth County in response to pre-trial publicity. Defense counsel Craig Albee argued that Julie Jensen was a depressed woman who killed herself and framed her husband. Moreover, the deceased had seen a therapist at least three times for depression and was aware of her husband's extramarital affair with a co-worker, Kelly LaBonte Grieman, whom Mark Jensen later married, and who assumed custody of the Jensens' two sons after Mark's eventual imprisonment. Evidence was introduced showing that Mark Jensen had discussed poisoning his wife with co-workers and a jailhouse associate, as well as searching on the internet for information relating to spousal murder and poisoning techniques. The prosecution contended further that Jensen remained angry over his wife's brief affair in 1991 with co-worker Perry Tarica. The letter's use by the prosecutors was controversial, because such evidence has been blocked from court for years by strict hearsay rules based on criminal defendants' rights to confront their accusers under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. But the Wisconsin Supreme Court, guided by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling (Crawford v Washington 541 U.S. 36 (2004)), held that the use of Julie Jensen's letter and statements could be admitted based on the \\"forfeiture by wrongdoing\\" doctrine, under which a defendant waives his right to confront a witness if he caused the witness to be absent. The letter was the critical factor in the trial that ended on February 22, 2008. The jury found Jensen, 48, guilty of his wife's murder after more than 30 hours of deliberations. He was sentenced by Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder on February 27, 2008, to life in prison with no chance of parole.  Appellate proceedings  On December 19, 2013, a federal judge overturned Jensen's conviction, and ordered he be released from prison within 90 days. The court agreed with Jensen's argument that the state's use of his dead wife's words violated his Constitutional right to confront witnesses testifying against him. The state of Wisconsin appealed the case, but in 2015 the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the district court's decision on September 8, 2015. Prosecutors decided to retry Jensen for the murder of his wife in January 2016.\\"Judge sets bail at $1.2M for Mark Jensen as he awaits retrial in 1998 death of his wife \\".

On September 1, 2017, Kenosha Circuit Judge Chad Kerkman reinstated Mark Jensen‚Äôs conviction.

He was born in Sarajevo to a family that cherished Bosnian traditional folk music. As a young boy, he received his first musical inspiration from his father Mustafa Kriliƒá, a well-known accordionist who worked with the major traditional vocalists of the ex- Yugoslav music scene from World War II on. After Edo Kriliƒá completed elementary school, he entered the Secondary Music School in Sarajevo. Although Sarajevo was a center of European music activity, it did not have higher education programs for piano accordion, so Kriliƒá studied clarinet with Professor Rajmund Likiƒá. Although the clarinet was completely new to him, Kriliƒá soon began to win provincial and national awards. He continued to improve his accordion skills as well, and made his first public appearances on accordion as a teen. He was an active member of the AKUD Slobodan Princip Seljo, one of the best-known cultural and artistic clubs in the former country. After completing the Secondary Music School, Kriliƒá studied at the Sarajevo Music Academy with Professor A. Radan. At that time, the legend of sevdalinka, the late Ismet Alajbegoviƒá ≈†erbo, retired from the Folk Orchestra of the RTV Sarajevo. Kriliƒá auditioned for and won the position, beginning his long professional career which eventually brought him together with many eminent soloists of traditional music. At the outbreak of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kriliƒá lived in Grbavica, the residential quarter of Sarajevo. When his two-year-old son was seriously injured, Kriliƒá's family was relocated to Austria. Kriliƒá remained in Sarajevo for the next two years to direct the Folk Orchestra of the RTVSA. He then joined his family in Austria, where he began a new career as a music teacher. He attended and graduated from the Austrian Music Conservatory, where he focused on classical accordion music. A versatile musician equally skilled in Eastern and Western musical traditions, he retains his love for the folk music of his people, appears with many traditional music stars, and actively helps young, talented musicians seeking to take their places in the music world.

Other works include Robots Don't Cry (a children's illustrated book), a one-shot Freakshow special written by Rob Curley, and a series of silent strips in 2000AD under the banner \\"Bob Byrne's Twisted Tales\\". His works include the original graphic novel Mr. Amperduke, a story told entirely in pictures without words, which Byrne published himself (trading as Clamnut Comix) in 2008. This character first appeared in a short story in MBLEH! in 2003. The first Mr. Amperduke story was reprinted in the small press of Judge Dredd Megazine #247 in 2006. This led to Byrne being commissioned to produce original stories for the Megazine's parent publication 2000 AD, using the same text-free storytelling technique. Another short Mr. Amperduke story appeared in Megazine #271 in 2009, when the graphic novel went into its second printing. In 2012 he released Spazzmoid, a collection of mostly autobiographical comics focused on growing up in Dublin in the 1980s. Byrne is also the creator of Dr. Moku learning system, used in teaching Japanese Hiragana and Katakana mnemonics. In 2010, with a bid to make his learning system more accessible to users, he launched respective mobile apps, viz., Dr. Moku's Hiragana Mnemonics and Dr. Moku's Katakana Mnemonics, compatible with Android (4.0 and up) as well as iOS (5.1 or later) devices. The app has been downloaded by over 250, 000 users.http://ww.itimes.com/blog/hope-you-can- learn-japanese-in-1-hour Awards * 2008 nominated for the Favourite Comics Writer/Artist Eagle Award Bibliography * Mr. Amperduke (2008) * Bob Byrne's Twisted Tales in 2000 AD #1536‚Äì1538, 1565‚Äì1566, 1599, 1615, 1639, 1643, 1647, 1729, 1730, 1755, 1802‚Äì1803, 1910, 1923, and Judge Dredd Megazine #294, 335, 338 (2007‚Äì15) * The Shiznit #1-4 * Robots Don't Cry * Mbleh! #1-3 * Dr. Moku - Learn Hiragana in one day (2010) * Spazzmoid (2012) References * Bob Byrne at 2000 AD online * Moku Hiragana Katakana Mobile Apps External links * Clamnut Comix website * O'Brien Books page for Robots Don't Cry * Stock Car Ninja - Bob's 24-hour comic from 2006   * Living people Irish comics artists Irish comics writers Year of birth missing (living people) Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Bob Byrne"},{"id":"16057070","text":"Building in KatueteKatuet√© is a town in the Canendiy√∫ department of Paraguay.

It was founded on February 2, 1785, by the Friar Lu√≠s de Bola√±os under the name of San Jos√© de los Campos Limpios de Tap√∫a. It was one of the first centers of Spanish‚ÄìGuaran√≠ crossbreeding. It is bordered by three rivers: The Paraguay River, the Salado River and the San Francisco River. Its saint patron is Saint Joseph. Characteristics This city is considered to be one of the first towns in the country. Piquete Cu√© It has an approximate area of shared in 9 companies and 20 urban neighborhoods and villas. Some of them still have a purely agricultural-rural character, while others are more urbanized. Is located away from Asunci√≥n, between the urbanized cities of the Central Department. To get there you should take the Route 3 \\"General Elizardo Aquino\\". Because of the explosive growth rate and its high population density, as well as a lack of infrastructure, it is a challenge for its inhabitants to develop opportunities. The city has a port over the Paraguay River named \\"Piquete Cu√©\\" that in its early times enabled commercial activities for the local industries. This district is an immigration center because of the nearness to Asunci√≥n and its infrastructure. History The Church of LimpioAlthough the reference to its origin is related to the era of the Spanish conquest, the history of Limpio does not have any chronological story. For clearing out the data of its origin we have to go back in the time that the Captain of Vergara, Domingo Mart√≠nez de Irala, came to the region in 1537 and started the crossbreeding marrying himself with the daughter of the Chief Mkirase, Yvoty Sa'yju (later renamed as Leonor), and acquired \\"carte blanche\\" among the natives. This title was later self-attributed by Mariano Roque Alonso. It maintains a privileged geographical position, bordered by ample and fertile valleys surrounding the Campos Limpios de Tapu'a (Clean Fields of Tapu'a). Because of that, for a long time this place was named San Jos√© de los Campos Limpios, but the name was later shortened to Limpio. Demography Limpio has 87,301 inhabitants, of which 43,945 are male and 43,355 are female, according to the General Direction of Statistics, Polls and Census. About 37% of its population is urban and 27% is rural. The rate of demographic growth is high ‚Äì 8.24% annually in the last year. The city experienced high rates of population growth as a result of the new pavement of Route 3 and the development of social urban programs. Tourism A central street of the cityAmong the places that could be visited in Limpio are: the picturesque El Pe√±√≥n in the Paraguay river, the San Francisco Isle, the old San Jos√© Church, the few colonial houses still standing and the famous Piquete Cu√© port, once one of the most important ports and where the initial trace of the Trans-Chaco Route used to pass. The elders say that the church in Limpio is over 400 years old, including the altarpieces that amaze with their colorful and exquisite design. Its facade is likely from the time of Carlos Antonio L√≥pez, who frequented that zone when the Surubi'y stanza (the first of the De la Plata River) was property of his daughter, Inocencia L√≥pez. Nowadays, the yard of the church displays beautiful vegetation and in the middle of it can be seen the grandiose first ecological sanctuary of the country. Also, the San Francisco Isle, with 15 kilometers long by 6 kilometers wide is considered as an ecological reserve. Art and culture MunicipalityThe craftsmanship of Limpio is based on the basketmaking and hats made of karanday. It also has the ballets \\"Karanday Poty\\" and \\"Ballet Mainumby\\". The celebrations honoring Saint Joseph, the saint patron of the city, form a part of the city's culture. Limpio also boasts the fountain of the first ecological sanctuary of the country. Many people gather in this place to refresh themselves with these waters which, according to the popular beliefs, are sacred.

Glades are variously sought for their solitude, beauty, or caches of ungroomed powder. Woods also tend to hold better snow longer thanks to the shade and shelter trees provide. Glade skiing is inherently more dangerous than skiing on trails and usually reserved for experts, though moderate glade terrain exists. Hazards such as cliffs or streams may or may not be blocked off by ski patrol. Other dangers include tree wells, logs, stumps, and the trees themselves. Equipment required includes a ski helmet, ski goggles, and gloves, all to protect against the trees and underbrush. Glade riders need to be fit and agile to negotiate trees and hidden obstacles such as tree wells or concealed root systems. Ski resorts may have defined glade trails, ungroomed glade areas, or boundary-to-boundary policies.  History  The first glade skiing in the eastern United States was on Mount Mansfield, in Vermont. Cut by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934, The Nose Dive, was a steep, narrow trail, and started with twisting turns. Below these difficult corners, to the left was a patch of skiable trees named the Slalom Glade, which appeared on the trail map in 1940.

The ten-day-long siege and battle was fought in Sicily between the Carthaginian forces under Hannibal Mago (a king of Carthage of the Magonid family, not the famous Hannibal of the Barcid family) and the Dorian Greeks of Selinus. The city of Selinus had defeated the Elymian city of Segesta in 415, an event that led to the Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415 and ended in the defeat of Athenian forces in 413. When Selinus again worsted Segesta in 411, Carthage, responding to the appeal of Segesta, had besieged and sacked Selinus after the Carthaginian offer of negotiations had been refused by the Greeks. This was the first step towards Hannibal's campaign to avenge the Carthaginian defeat at the first battle of Himera in 480. The city of Selinus was later rebuilt, but never regained her former status. Background The island of Sicily contained the Elymians, Sikans, and the Siculi living in respective communities before the Phoenicians had started their colonisation of Sicily after 800 BC. The Phoenicians had initially planted trading posts all over the coast of Sicily, but never penetrated far inland and ultimately withdrew without resistance to the western half of the island (concentrating in the cities of Motya, Panormus, and Soluntum) with the arrival of the Greek colonists after 750. The Ionian Greeks took the lead in colonising Sicily among Greeks when they planted Naxos in 735, and spread north and west along the island coast until the city of Himera was founded in around 648, bordering the Phoenician territory of Soluntum. The Dorian Greeks founded Syracuse in 734 and spread south then west along the coastline until Selinus was founded around 654, bordering the Phoenician territory of Motya. While the Ionian Greeks on the whole had friendly relations with the native Sicilians and the Phoenicians, the Dorian Greeks were comparably more aggressive, pushing inland at the expense of the natives to expand the Greek domain. Conflicts among the Greeks colonies and between the natives and Greeks erupted, but these were mostly localised affairs without any decisive results or intervention from non-Sicilian powers. The Phoenicians and Carthaginians traded with everyone in Sicily and on the whole all the island colonies prospered. This prosperity caused some of the Greek cities to start to expand their territories again, ultimately leading to the events known as the Sicilian Wars. =Carthaginian hegemony= The Phoenicians in Sicily had not resisted the initial Greek expansion by force of arms, but this state of affairs changed when the Greeks began to encroach on their territory in Western Sicily. Phoenicians had aided the Elymians against the Dorian Greeks of Selinus in 580, when a Greek colonization attempt of the area around future Lilybaeum (which lies across the Phoenician colony of Motya) was defeated by their joint effort. Nothing is known of the role of Carthage in this episode, and it is possible that the Sicilian Phoenicians were not a part of the Punic hegemony at that time.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p. 55 The Carthaginian king Malchus is said to have \\"conquered all Sicily\\" and sent booty captured to Tyre sometime after this event. This probably implies that Carthage had incorporated the Phoenician colonies of Motya, Panormus, and Solus into the Punic hegemony led by Carthage, which had begun to resist Greek encroachment of the Western Mediterranean after 600 BC. The growth of Selinus and Himera during the period Malchus was active in Sicily indicates that Carthaginians were not in conflict with the Sicilian Greeks at that time. However, Carthage countered the expedition of Spartan Dorieus in 510 and the Greeks were defeated near Eryx, a clear indication that Carthage now held sway over the Phoenician interests in Sicily. A war followed this event, which eventually led to Carthage destroying the city of Heraclea Minoa.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p. 67 The year this event took place is not known, but Carthage did not intervene in Sicily again until 480 after Heraclea had been destroyed. Carthage granted the Sicilian Phoenicians local autonomy, keeping control of their foreign policy, extracting some sort of tribute in exchange for military aid. The Elymians, dominated by Segesta, were given allied status, protecting them from further hostility of Selinus, which had also allied herself with Carthage because of the threat presented by the rise of Akragas. =Greek tyrants= Two Greeks from Gela, Cleander and Gelo, had been involved in the war that eventually destroyed Heraclea Minoa. An appeal for aid to avenge the death of Dorieus was ignored by mainland Greece, even by Leonidas of Sparta, the brother of Dorieus and who later would win immortal fame at a narrow pass called the Gates of Fire near Thermopylae in 480. While Carthage was engaged in Sardinia, the Greek colonies in Sicily had fallen under the rule of tyrants. Some of these tyrants, notably those ruling Gela, Akragas, and Rhegium, sought to expand their dominion at the expense of native Sicilians and other Greek cities during 505 -480 BC, with the Dorian city of Gela being the most successful. Tyrants like Cleander and Hippocrates successfully took over Sicel and Ionian Greek territory, and by 490, Zankle, Leontini, Catana, and Naxos had fallen under Gelan control. Syracuse had managed to survive the attempts of Hippocrates with help from Corinth, but Gelo, the successor of Hippocrates, captured Syracuse and made the city his capital. Akragas expanded her territory against the Sikans and Sicels, and under Theron, allied with Gelo to forestall any future conflicts between the neighboring powers. The Ionian Greeks, having lost Naxos and Catana to Gelan aggression, responded by creating an alliance between tyrants of Himera and Rhegion. Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegion, who had managed to detach Zankle from the clutches of Syracuse by 485 BC, married the daughter of Terillus, tyrant of Himera. Both Himera and Rhegion also made treaties with Carthage. Terillus went further, becoming guest-friend of Hamicar Mago, \\"king\\" of Carthage. Thus three powers were delicately balanced in Sicily by 483. Carthage kept the peace between Elymians and Selinus, while the Ionian Greeks in the north (led by Himera and Rhegion) faced the Dorians Greeks from the South, led by Syracuse and Akragas. This situation changed when Theron, with support from citizens of Himera, deposed Terillus and took over that city in 483 BC. Carthage intervened at the instigation of Anaxilus, and the Sicilian Greeks under the tyrants Gelo and Theron crushed the Punic expedition of 480 in the 1st battle of Himera. The Carthaginian domain in Western Sicily was untouched by this defeat. Carthage had refrained from intervening in Sicilian affairs for 70 years while expanding her hegemony in Africa, Sardinia and Spain. This defeat of an external power brought prosperity, but not peace, for Sicilians, Greeks, and non-Greeks alike. The political landscape in Sicily during those years changed as some of the Greek tyrants were replaced by democracy and oligarchy, the influence of Syracuse shrank in Sicily and infighting between the Greek cities flared up. Athens had sent fleets to Sicily in 427, 425 and 424 to intervene in these conflicts, which ultimately caused Hermocrates of Syracuse to request all Sicilian Greek cities to remain at peace at the congress of Gela in 424. Peace between Greeks and the natives of Sicily was not part of this agreement. Ironically, the defeated Carthaginians and their allies, the Elymians seem to have enjoyed comparably more peaceful existence after the battle of Himera until 415. =Selinus versus Segesta= Greek Selinus and Elymian Segesta share a long history of trade and conflict. The cities were trading partners and had a close enough relationship to have passed laws allowing inter-marriage between citizens.Thucydides 6.6.2 There had been conflicts as well; The Phoenicians had aided the Elymians to beat back the Greek invasions of 580 and 510 BC of Lilybaeum and Eryx. It is unknown what role Segesta played in the war where Carthage destroyed Minoa. Segesta was neutralHerodotus 7.165- no mention of Elymians among the Punic army during the first battle of Himera (ironically Selinus had sided Carthage). The period following Himera was one of prosperity for both cities. Around 454 BC, a conflict involving Motya, Segesta, Selinus and Akragas took place, details are confusingFreeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Vol. II, pp. 551-557 book except that Carthage was not involved, Selinus won a victory and the Elymians had appealed for aid from Athens without any known results. After a peace lasting almost 3 decades, Segestan power seem to have weakenedDiodorus Siculus 12.82.4-7, Thucydides 6.20.4 & 6.22 and Selinus opened hostilities in 416 BC. Athenenian expedition The Greeks of Selinus crossed the upper reaches of the River MazarosFreeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Vol. III, pp. 81-82 and occupied some disputed lands on the border of Segestan domain and started to raid Segestan territory. Segesta requested the Greeks to stop, and when this was not heeded, they managed to recapture the lands, but the Greeks defeated them in a later battle.Diodorus Siculus, XII.82 Segesta then requested Akragas and Syracuse to intervene in vain, in fact Syracuse joined Selinus and sent a fleet to blockade the Elymian coast.Thucydides VI.6.2 In desperation Segesta sent an embassy to Carthage, but the Carthaginians refused any aid. Segesta had allied with Athens in 426 BC when they had intervened in Sicily for the first timeThucydides 6.2 and an embassy was sent to Athens begging aid. The resultant Athenian invasion of Sicily during 415-413 BC was destroyed by a combined effort of Sicilian cities including Selinus and Syracuse. As an ally of Athens, the position of Segesta had become precarious. Renewed Selinute aggression After the Athenian defeat, Selinus sought to expand her domain again. Her geographic position meant an expansion had to be against either Motya to the West or Akragas to the east or against Segesta to the north. Conflict with Motya meant taking on Carthage, while Akragas was the wealthiest city in Sicily and a relatively stronger opponent compared to Segesta. Furthermore, Segesta was allied to an enemy power and conquering the Elymians would have given Selinus control of an area rivaling that of Syracuse in size and direct land access to the Tyrrhenian Sea ‚Äì and direct trade route with the Etruscan and Massaliot markets. Selinus resumed hostilities in 410, again reoccupying the disputed lands across the River Mazaros. Segesta, fearing that any resistance would bring Syracuse into the fray against them,Diodorus Siculus XIII.43 remained passive, but the Greeks continued to raid Segestan domain. Segesta now sent an embassy to Carthage begging for protection. Carthaginian response Carthage, during the 70 years following the battle of Himera, had expanded her domain in Africa, explored new trade routes on the Atlantic coasts of Africa and Europe and had pacified Sardinia under the leadership of the Magonid dynasty, but had not intervened in Sicilian affairs ‚Äì and Sicilian Greeks had also refrained from provoking her. By changing trade patterns and consolidating markets Carthage had by 430 amassed a huge hoard of gold and silver.Thucydides VI.34.2 The Greeks were aware of the growing power of Carthage, which is why Syracuse had contemplated requesting her aid against the Athenian invasion, while the Athenians actually asked Carthage for aid during the invasion.Thucydides VI.88.6 Carthage had denied aid to both, and also declined to help Segesta in 416. The situation was different in 411, when the Segastans renewed their plea. =Reason for intervention= Firstly, Segesta decided to submit to Carthage and become a dependent ally. This probably meant that Segesta would retain internal and commercial autonomy, but surrender control of foreign policy, pay for any Punic garrison housed in Elymian territory and perhaps pay tribute in return for Carthaginian protection. Secondly, one of the Suffets of Carthage was Hannibal Mago, a member of the Magonid dynasty ‚Äì and no lover of Greeks. From the Carthaginian prospective, probably three factors stood out: A victory of Selinus would mean a strong power in Western Sicily capable of threatening Punic interests, submission of Segesta would enlarge the Carthaginian domain, while any intervention risked a war with the mighty Syracuse. The Carthaginian Senate debated the matter at length, and the influence of Hannibal finally secured a verdict for accepting Segestan submission to the Punic hegemony and lending aid to Segesta. Hannibal was authorized to aid Segesta by any means necessary. =Shuttle diplomacy= Hannibal was not influenced by his personal feelings while tackling his task. He sent an embassy to Selinus proposing they keep the disputed lands in exchange for a ceasefire with Segesta. This move gave Carthage some time to mobilize troops, as they had no standing army, and had it succeeded, it would have enlarged the Carthaginian domain (Segesta was a dependency now), ensured Segestan security without war. The Carthaginian offer was debated in council, and Empidion, a citizen with ties to Carthage, strongly advocated acceptance of these terms to avoid a conflict with Carthage.Diodorus Siculus XIII.59 The Greeks of Selinus chose to decline the Carthaginian offer. Hannibal next sent Carthaginian and Segestan envoys to Syracuse, with a proposition that they mediate in the dispute between Selinus and Segesta ‚Äì calculating that Selinus would refuse arbitration and then Syracuse would decline to become further involved. When a Selinite embassy told the Syracusans that they should mediate in the matter, Syracusans replied that they would neither break their alliance with Selinus nor break the peace with Carthage. Carthage thus had a free hand to deal with Selinus, without the fear of outright interference from Syracuse. Carthaginian diplomacy had managed to isolate Selinus for the time being. =Expedition of 410= Carthage maintained no standing army, so Hannibal initially sent an army made of 5,000 African soldiers and 800 Italian mercenaries (previously in service with the Athenian expedition)Kern, Paul B, Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 165 to Sicily, (Carthage also provided horses for the Italians), and stationed this force at Segesta. While the army of Selinus was plundering Segestan territory and had scattered into small groups because of carelessness, the reinforced army of Segesta sallied forth, caught the scattered Selinute soldiers by surprise, inflicted almost 1,000 casualties on the Greeks and captured all the booty collected by them.Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p. 29 Segesta was secure from Greek raids for the moment, as the Greeks retreated back to Selinus after this clobbering. Syracuse received a request for aid from Selinus after this fiasco, which was voted but nothing was done at this time. Segesta meanwhile, probably fearful of Syracusan retaliation, appealed for further aid to Carthage.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Vol. III, p. 453 Main expedition Hannibal, responding to the Segestan appeal, put together a larger force, said to have numbered 120,000 men, including 4,000 cavalry, recruited from Africa, Sardinia, Spain, and even Sicilian Greeks, and this army even contained many Carthaginian volunteers.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily p. 142 Modern estimates place the army strength at 30,000-40,000 soldiers. The army started mustering in the summer of 410, and did not set forth until the spring of 409. =Carthaginian cohorts= The Carthaginian army composed of mercenaries from various nations. The Libyans supplied both heavy and light infantry and formed the most disciplined units of the army. The heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasess. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as the Iberian light infantry. Iberian soldiers wore purple-bordered white tunics and leather headgear. Iberian heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields, and short thrusting swords.Goldsworthy, Adrian, The fall of Carthage, p. 32 Campanian, Sardinian and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear,Makroe, Glenn E., Phoenicians, pp. 84-86 but often were equipped by Carthage. The Libyans, Carthaginian citizens and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Numidia contributed superb light cavalry armed with bundles of javelins and riding without bridle or saddle. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all out charge. Allied cities of the Punic hegemony contributed contingents for the army as well. Carthaginian officer corps held overall command of the army, although many units may have fought under their chieftains. Greeks hired from Sicily and Italy fought as hoplites. =Selinus: location and defence= Selinus was one of the richest cities in Sicily, settled by Dorian Greeks from Megara Hybla in 628. Although not in the same league with Syracuse and Akragas, its location and citizens were expected to offer a taught defence - which was the assumption made by the Syracusans when preparing their relief army. City features The city of Selinus sits on a hill (height approximately , it is gently sloped on three sides except on the seaward side to the south)Rivela, Antonio, The Dead Cities of Sicily between the rivers Selinus and Hypsas. The walled acropolis to the south of the hill contained the original city, which later extended towards the north, covering the whole hill. Somewhere North of the acropolis was the agora. Selinus contained two harbors located to the west and east of the hill on the mouths of the rivers. To the west and east of the city, beyond the rivers, are two hills on top of which some of the temples of the city are located. The exact location of the city wall cannot be traced, but it may have covered at least the acropolis and hill on which the city stood.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 164 Defenders Large Sicilian cities like Syracuse and Akragas could field up to 10,000 to 20,000 citizens,Diodorus Siculus, X.III.84 while smaller ones like Himera and Messana mustered between 3,000Diodorus Siculus, X.IV.40 and 6,000Diodorus Siculus XIII.60 soldiers. Selinus probably had between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers, and no mercenaries to augment their numbers. The soldiers of Selinus were hoplites, and the city also had a considerable number of cavalry available for its defence. Little is known about the state of Selinute warships or their disposition at this time. Selinus had fought most of its war away from the city after 480, so it is understandable that the walls of Selinus were said to have fallen into ill repair.Kern, Paul B, Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 164 During the siege, all citizens, including women and old men, were mobilized, and most served as improvised missile troops. By pelting the attacking enemy with tiles, brick and other objects, these impromptu peltasts could take a heavy toll during urban fighting. =Carthaginian expedition to Sicily= Under the escort of 60 triremesDiodorus Siculus 13.54.1-5 the soldiers, supplies, and siege equipment were ferried from Africa to Motya in Sicily by 1,500 transports in the spring of 409. Levies from the Sicilian Punic cities and Segesta joined the force at Motya. Hannibal allowed one day rest for his soldiers before setting out for Selinus, capturing the city of Mazara, an outpost of Selinus, on the way. This city served as the supply base for the Punic army during the campaign. The army carried their siege equipment with them to Selinus, while the Carthaginian fleet stayed at Motya.Freeman Edward A., Sicily, p. 142 Selinus, however, was forewarned of Hannibal's approach, as some of their cavalry had scouted out the Carthaginian army on their arrival at Motya and issued prompt warnings. The Selinute citizens prepared their defenses, called all their citizens outside the city to within their walls, and collected provisions to stand a siege, while requests for help were sent to Gela and Syracuse. Setting up the siege The Carthaginian army reached the city before any help arrived and camped on the western hill near the acropolis before commencing siege operations. Hannibal did not fully invest Selinus by building circumventing walls, as the construction delay might have given Syracuse and other Sicilian Greek cities ample time to send a large army and foil the Carthaginian enterprise. Instead of starving the Greeks into submission, Hannibal chose to attack the city directly with the help of siege equipment. A repeat of the Carthaginian debacle at Himera was not on Hannibal's agenda. The Carthaginian army did not immediately attack Selinus; some time was taken to set up the siege works and assemble the siege engines. =First assault= Leaving a detachment on the eastern side of the city to foil any approaching Greek relief army,Kern, Paul B, Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 163 the Carthaginians probably attacked the northern side of the city with six wooden siege towers and battering rams supported by the Italian mercenaries on the first day.Diodorus Siculus 13.55.6-7 The rams were covered by iron plating to secure them against fire. Selinus had not experienced any siege in the recent past so had little knowledge about dealing with siege warfare. The siege towers, which were taller than the city walls, contained a large number of slingers and missile troops. These attacked the defenders on the walls, who were ultimately forced to flee from the hail of missiles. Then the battering rams were employed against the walls, which were eventually breached. However, the follow-up infantry attack, led by the Campanians,Diodorus Siculus 13.55.5 was ultimately repulsed after an all-day battle, part of the reason being that the rubble of the walls had not been cleared away and it impeded the movements of the Carthaginian detachment. While the men of Selinus fought off the Carthaginians, the women and old men carried supplies to the walls and effected repairs. At nightfall, the Carthaginians broke off the assault and retired to their camp. The Selinites took this opportunity to again send messages to Akragas, Gela, and Syracuse and to repair the damage to their walls. Horsemen carried the messages, and could have reached Syracuse in two days; the Syracusans could have reached the city in five.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Vol. III, p. 464 Akragas and Gela opted to wait for the Syracusan response before acting on behalf of Selinus. Syracuse, then engaged against Leontini and Naxos,Diodorus Siculus 13.56 broke off hostilities to gather a relief army, but the speed of their preparations was dictated by the assumption that Selinus would hold out for a long time against the Carthaginians.Kern, Paul B, Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 166 This assumption was erroneous because the Carthaginians were superior at siege warfare. One scholar had commented that among the Greek states of the 5th century, Athens had a reputation for being the most formidable in siege warfare, but compared to the skill of Asian and African powers in this art, its reputation is like the reputation of a one-eyed man among the blind. Final assault Hannibal renewed his efforts the following day. Archers and slingers positioned on top of the six siege towers again cleared the walls of Greek defenders at different sections of the city wall.Diodorus Siculus, 13.55.6-7 Six battering rams were again employed against the walls and ultimately several breaches were made for the Punic infantry to exploit. After the rubble was cleared away from the breaches, groups of soldiers assaulting in relays were unleashed on the town defenders through the gaps in the walls.Kern, Paul B, Ancient Siege Warfare, pp. 165-66 Once the walls were breached, the Greeks abandoned their effort to defend them. They barricaded the narrow streets and fought a fierce hand-to-hand battle with the attackers. For nine days and nights a bitter street-by-street battle raged, the Iberian troops of the Punic army leading the assault against the Greeks. The Greeks fought back fiercely in the streets, while tiles and bricks were hurled on the Carthaginians by women on the rooftops. Despite heavy casualties, the weight of numbers slowly enabled the Carthaginians to advance through the city. On the ninth day, the Greek women ran out of missiles, which eased the conditions for the Carthaginians. The Greeks began to fall back and ultimately the last stand of the Greeks took place in the Agora. When all resistance finally ceased in Selinus, 6,000 Greeks were made prisoners, 3,000 soldiers had escaped to Akragas, while 16,000 Greeks had died in the battle and the subsequent massacre.Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p. 30 The Carthaginians spared only those who had sought shelter in the temples in the city. Aftermath The Syracusan vanguard of 3,000 troops under Diocles had arrived at Akragas when Carthaginians finally captured Selinus. Unable to aid in the defense of that city, Diocles opened negotiations with Hannibal. The first Greek delegation was given harsh answers, but the second one led by Empediones, a pro Carthaginian Selinute, obtained permission to eventually rebuild the city and ransom prisoners.Freeman, Sicily, p. 143 The Carthaginians razed the city to the ground, but spared the temples from any desecration, although the temple treasures were carried off. The mission entrusted to Hannibal had been totally fulfilled with the destruction of Selinus. Instead of returning to Carthage or negotiating a truce with the now hostile Greeks, Hannibal chose to march against Himera, the site of the crushing Carthaginian defeat in 480. Syracusans, alert to the situation, began preparations to aid Himera in earnest. It is not known if the city of Himera had played a part in the battle of Selinus. Selinus would later serve as the base for Hermocrates of Syracuse for his raiding on Punic territory in 407, who would rebuild the walls of Selinus. The peace of 405 would allow Greeks to resettle in Selinus, but as a city, Selinus would never rise to its former glory, and would never again be a threat to Segesta. It was finally destroyed during the First Punic War by Carthage, and its citizens were relocated to Lilybaeum. References Sources    * External links *Diodorus Siculus translated by G.

It was built for the Duke of Richmond as the feudal mill of the Goodwood Estate. The surviving mill is thought to date from the 1740s and is known to have been standing c.1780. Halnaker Mill was working until struck by lightning in 1905, damaging the sails and windshaft. The derelict mill was restored in 1934 by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights as a memorial to the wife of Sir William Bird.

Description Halnaker Mill is a four-storey tower mill with a sixteen sided beehive cap. The mill was originally hand wound, and later fitted with a fantail, which was not replicated when the mill was restored. The four common sails were originally carried on a wooden windshaft, which was damaged by the 1905 lightning strike. A cast iron windshaft and wooden brake wheel from a wind sawmill at Punnetts Town were fitted. The windshaft is cast in two pieces, bolted together and was too short for Halnaker Mill. Neve's inserted a spacer to lengthen it. The mill worked two pairs of overdrift millstones.

In recognition of the Kendall contribution to Primitive Methodism the Kendall Memorial Chapel was opened in 1885 in the hamlet of Ashby, Lincolnshire (now part of Scunthorpe) the home of the Kendall family since the 1820s.

Kendall the historian Kendall's lasting claim to fame is the three separate histories of the Primitive Methodist Church. The second of these was commissioned for publication in 1907, the centenary of the first Primitive Methodist Camp Meeting, 31 May 1807. He is therefore regarded amongst British Methodists as one of the essential sources of information on this subject. =History of the Primitive Methodist Connexion, 1888= H B Kendall's first significant history was published in 1888 (this date is inferred from material in the book). This shows a combination of literary style and scholarship which made Kendall a candidate for writing the most substantial of all the histories for the Camp Meeting Centenary. Kendall's skills would have been enhanced by his time as Connexional Editor, and retirement would have freed him to do the work. This the shortest work (120 pages of text, equivalent to A5 size) =The Origin and History of the Primitive Methodist Church, 1906= First printing was published in 14 fascicules H B Kendall was honoured with being asked to write the major publication celebrating the Camp Meeting Centenary. This detailed work is generally regarded as the definitive history of Primitive Methodism. It was first published as a set of 14 fascicules of 80 pages each in paper covers, often breaking in mid-sentence between volumes. There are a few misprints, for example the dates of the first two Ramsor Camp Meetings being given as 1809 when they were actually 1808.Kendall, op. cit. Ch. III. (The first two dated as 1809 is obviously a misprint, at odds with all other sources, including Kendall's other works, and the date of the 3rd Camp Meeting) The main printing was in 2 hardback volumes (1906).

The advantages of this volume are that it provides a more condensed summary of the history, and it contains information up to 1918.

(Hartley was famous for making jam and related products, and he was an important benefactor of the Primitive Methodist ministerial training college in Manchester. This later had a change of name to commemorate Hartley's support of the college.) Death He died on 10 March 1919 in Bournemouth, Hampshire, England. He was buried in Boscombe Cemetery.

Hannibal, acting under the instructions of the Carthaginian senate, had previously sacked and destroyed the city of Selinus after the Battle of Selinus in 409. Hannibal then destroyed Himera which was never rebuilt. Background Phoenicians of Western Sicily had aided the Elymians against the Dorian Greeks of Selinus in 580, when a Greek colonization attempt of Lilybaeum was defeated.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p. 55 The invasion of Spartan Dorieus was again defeated by Carthage near Eryx in 510, and a war followed where Carthage destroyed the city of Hereclea Minoa.Freeman, Edward A., Sicily, p. 67 Carthage signed treaties with the cities of Selinus, Himera, and Zankle by 490. The pretext for launching the Punic Sicilian expedition of 480 was the restoration of the deposed tyrant of Himera. The Sicilian Greeks under the tyrants Gelo of Syracuse and Theron of Akragas had crushed the Punic expedition in the 1st battle of Himera in 480 BC. Carthage had stayed away from Sicilian Greek affairs following the defeat for 70 years, during which time Greek culture started to penetrate the Elymian, Sikanian, and Sicel cities. The political landscape in Sicily also changed as Greek tyrants were replaced by democracy and oligarchy, the domain of Syracuse shrunk, and infighting between Greek cities flared up in Sicily. Athens had sent fleets to Sicily in 427, 425, and 424 to intervene, which caused Hermocrates of Syracuse requesting all Sicilian Greek cities to remain at peace at the congress of Gela in 424. The Elymian city of Segesta had clashed with Selinus over territorial rights and marriage issues and had been worsted in the conflict. After an appeal to Carthage was turned down in 415, Athens heeded the plea for help and sent over an expedition that was ultimately defeated at Syracuse in 413. Faced with renewed hostility from Selinus, Segesta again appealed to Carthage in 410. The Carthaginian Senate, after some debate, agreed to intervene. This appeal came at a time when the mainland Greek cities were locked in the Peloponnesian War, and Syracuse, an ally of Sparta, was not focused on Sicily. The Syracusan fleet was operating in the Aegean Sea. Prelude Hannibal Mago sent two expeditions to Sicily, the first one in 410 which drove the Selinute army from Segestan territory, and the second one obliterated Selinus after besieging the city in 409.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, pp. 163-66 The mission given to Hannibal by the Carthaginian Senate was fulfilled with the fall of Selinus. However, Hannibal chose to march on Himera and avenge the defeat of his grandfather 70 years before. =Opposing forces= Carthage is said to have mobilized 120,000 men, including 4,000 cavalry, recruited from Africa, Sardinia, Spain, and even Sicilian Greeks for the Selinute campaign in 409, but a realistic estimate is around 40,000 soldiers.Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, pp. 31‚Äì32, Yale University Press 1990 The Carthaginian army, after the battle of Selinus, had been reinforced by 20,000 Sicel and Elymian soldiers on the way to Himera,Church, Alfred J., Carthage, p. 31 boosting its strength to 50,000 soldiers at that point.Caven, Brian, Dionysius I, pp. 30‚Äì31, 38, Yale University Press 1990 =Carthaginian Cohorts= The Carthaginian army was made up of many nationalities. The Libyans supplied both heavy and light infantry and formed the most disciplined units of the army. The heavy infantry fought in close formation, armed with long spears and round shields, wearing helmets and linen cuirasses. The light Libyan infantry carried javelins and a small shield, same as Iberian light infantry. The Iberian infantry wore purple-bordered white tunics and leather headgear. The heavy infantry fought in a dense phalanx, armed with heavy throwing spears, long body shields, and short thrusting swords.Goldsworthy, Adrian, The fall of Carthage, p. 32 Campanian, Sicel, Sardinian, and Gallic infantry fought in their native gear,Makroe, Glenn E., Phoenicians, pp. 84-86 but often were equipped by Carthage. Sicels and other Sicilians were equipped like Greek hoplites. The Libyans, Carthaginian citizens, and the Libyo-Phoenicians provided disciplined, well-trained cavalry equipped with thrusting spears and round shields. Numidia provided superb light cavalry armed with bundles of javelins and riding without bridle or saddle. Iberians and Gauls also provided cavalry, which relied on the all-out charge. Carthage at this time did not use elephants, but Libyans provided the bulk of the heavy, four-horse war chariots for Carthage,Warry, John. Warfare in the Classical World. pp. 98-99. which were not present at Himera in 409. Carthaginian officer corps held overall command of the army, although many units may have fought under their chieftains. =Greek forces= The mainstay of the Greek army was the hoplite, drawn mainly from the citizens and mercenaries. Sicels and other native Sicilians also served in the army as hoplites and also supplied peltasts, which is a unit where the poorer citizens also served. The phalanx was the standard fighting formation of the army. The cavalry was recruited from wealthier citizens and hired mercenaries. Large Sicilian cities like Syracuse and Akragas could field up to 10,000 ‚Äì 20,000 citizens,Diodorus Siculus, XIII.84 while smaller ones like Himera and Messana mustered between 3,000Diodorus Siculus, XIV.40‚Äì6,000Diodorus Siculus XIII.60 soldiers. Syracuse sent a relief force, originally recruited for aiding Selinus to Himera; it included 3,000 soldiers from Syracuse, 1,000 from Akragas, and probably 1,000 mercenaries.Diodorus Siculus XIII.59.4-9 Battle Hannibal marched to Himera probably using the same route taken by the Selinus horsemen in 480Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily Vol. III, p. 477 and set up his main camp on the west of the city, while about a third of the army encamped to the south of Himera.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 166 The city of Himera sits on top of a hill 300‚Äì400 feet high on the western bank of the River Himera. The hill is steep in the northern, western, and eastern sides, but gradually slopes to the south. There are hills to the west and south of the city.Freeman, Edward A., History of Sicily, Volume 1, pp. 414-416 Instead of building a circumventing wall and fully investing the city, the Carthaginians assaulted the walls with the help of siege towers and battering rams after setting up their camps. However, the city walls withstood the attack and no breaches could be made for the Punic infantry to exploit. Hannibal then sent sappers, who dug tunnels under the walls and collapsed sections of it by setting fire to the wooden support beams.Diodorus Siculus, 13.59.8 Carthaginian infantry then attacked through the gap, but the Himerans repulsed the Punic assault on the city, and then threw up makeshift walls to close the breaches.Diodorus Siculus 13.59.4-6 Sometime after this event, Syracusan general Diocles arrived with 3,000 Syracusan hoplites, 1,000 soldiers from Akragas, and another 1,000 mercenaries, and entered the city. Joining the Himeran force of about 10,000 troopsChurch, Alfred J. Carthage, pp. 31-32 (majority hoplites with some cavalry and peltasts), the Greeks launched a surprise attack on the Punic lines, probably on the forces posted to the south of the city. The Greeks achieved total surprise and in the confusion, Carthaginian troops fought each other as well as Greeks. As the Carthaginians ultimately broke and fled after losing about 6,000 soldiers, Greek soldiers went after the scattered remnants of their enemy. At this point, Hannibal launched a counterattack with the force he had held in reserve at the other camp (to the west of Himera), routed the Greeks and chased them back into the city, with 3,000 Greeks losing their lives in the debacle.Diodorus Siculus 13.60 The main Syracusan fleet was away from Sicily, but 25 triremes had arrived at Himera after the battle from Syracuse. As the Carthaginian fleet was at Motya, their arrival gave the Greeks command of the sea around Himera.Kern, Paul B., Ancient Siege Warfare, p. 167 Hannibal spread a false report that the Punic army was going to attack Syracuse after sailing there from Motya, as the main army of Syracuse was approaching Himera, thus leaving their city unguarded. This convinced the Syracusans to leave Himera for their mother city. The city of Himera had little chance of withstanding the Carthaginians on their own, so they decided to evacuate the city.Diodorus Siculus 13.61 Diocles marched out of the city with half the men and all his troops at night, the Syracusan ships evacuated as many of the women and children as possible. The Carthaginians resumed their assaults the next day. The city managed to hold out for one day. Just as the Syracusan fleet was returning and was within sight of the city the following day, the Carthaginians broke through. Iberian troops of the Punic army had managed to secure a gap in the wall, and also the sections of the wall flanking the gap. This held off the Greeks until the Carthaginian army stormed the city through the gap, and the reduced garrison of Himera was overcome by the weight of numbers.Diodorus Siculus 13.62.1-4 Acts of vengeance Hannibal sacrificed 3,000 Greek prisoners at the place where Hamilcar, his grandfather and leader of the 480 expedition, had fallen. The city of Himera was utterly destroyed, even all the temples were flattened to the ground, and the women and children were enslaved. Hannibal did not, however, divert a river over the city site (like the Greeks did at Sybaris in 511) to complete his revenge. The spoils of war were divided among his troops, and the prisoners were sold into slavery. The Italian mercenaries, who mostly led the assault, complained that they had been abused by their commander and that their payment was not sufficient.Diodorus Siculus 13.62.5 They were subsequently discharged, and then took service with the Greeks. Aftermath Hannibal did not go after Akragas or Syracuse, the Sicilian cities mainly responsible for the humiliation at Himera at 480 after sacking Himera. He disbanded his army (the remaining Italian mercenaries chose to take service with Syracuse), garrisoned the Punic territory with sufficient troops and returned to Carthage with the fleet, where he was received with honors. Himera as a city would never be rebuilt again. The survivors of Himera built a city called Thermae nearby, which housed a mixed population of Greeks and Phoenicians. The Greek response to the sack of Himera was mild. Syracuse chose to expand her fleet and Akragas began to expand her army, but no official action was taken against Carthage or the Punic territory in Western Sicily. Hermocrates, a Syracusan general, chose to use the sack of Himera to set up a base at Selinus around 407 and raid the territories of Motya and Panormus, which provoked a strong Carthaginian response and almost the whole of Sicily fell under Carthaginian domination by 405.

This term is derived from the original term Ha Say Fu(‰∏ãÂõõÂ∫ú) pronounced similarly, but in the past referred to the four lower districts/Prefectures in Guangdong Province. The lower districts or Xia Si Fu (in Mandarin)referred to Gaozhou (È´òÂ∑ûÂ∫ú), Leizhou (Èõ∑Â∑ûÂ∫ú), Qinzhou (Èí¶Â∑ûÂ∫ú) and Qiongzhou (ÁêºÂ∑ûÂ∫ú). Gaozhou and Leizho refer to the modern areas of Zhanjiang (ÊπõÊ±ü) and Maoming (ËåÇÂêç) in Guangdong Province. This style of Hung Kuen is practiced widely in China and across South East Asia but was rarely known in the west, with the exception in the United States, where Grandmaster Kwong Wing Lam is considered a practitioner of this style of kung fu.Ching, Gene, The Roots and Culture of Hung Gar. Shadows of Ha Say Fu Hung Gar Lie Between shaolin Temple and Grandmaster Wing Lam, in: Wushu KUNGFU, Aug/Sep, 1998, p. 48-52. Leung Hwa Chiu  Name of the System  The style may have been known as Zhanjiang Hung Kuen in China, but it has been given the name of Ha Say Fu (Lower Four Districts) by Grandmaster Wing Lam, and later his students desired a more inspired title for the art, given that the pronunciation of the Chinese character \\"province\\" is similar to that of \\"tiger.\\" Therefore, Grandmaster Wing Lam and his students began referring to the style as \\"the Four Lower Tigers.\\"  Ha Say Fu Style today  Grandmaster Wing Lam and Sifu Alamudeen Hasayfu is a rarely demonstrated system of kung fu outside of China and South East Asia. In the United States, Grandmaster Wing Lam studied the style with Leung Hwa Chiu and taught it as part of an overall Hung Kuen curriculum that included Lam family Hung Gar, with Ha Say Fu taught to advanced students. Sifu Saleem Alamudeen, Grandmaster Wing Lam's disciple, teaches Hasayfu as a separate curriculum.  System Characteristics  = Stance Training = Basic conditioning consists of stance trainingHung Kuen Net - Online Hung Gar Kung Fu Resources and qigong. The basic stances of Hasayfu Hung Ga are the straight bow and staggered bow stances, staggered horse stance, cat stance, twist stance, and the Yee-Gee Kim-Yeung Ma. The Yee-Gee Kim-Yeung Ma is the foundation stance of Hasayfu Hung Gar. It is used in training much like the square horse stance of the other styles. Feet are turned inward and knees pushed outward. At the same time, the pelvis is pushed forward, chest is hollowed and leans backward slightly, forming an \\"S\\" shape. = Forms = The curriculum differs across the various branches, but is commonly recognized in southern China as a 10 animal system.Taiping Institute - Hung Kuen In the US, only five animals formed the style under the tutelage Wing Lam, which consists of empty hand form sets that are known in Chinese martial arts as the Five Animals. The Five Animals of Hasayfu are: Panther, Tiger, Snake, Crane, and Dragon. These forms are usually taught in this sequence. It is thought that the natural elements of the animals can be perceived and appreciated by proper understanding of the forms. Each hand form contains unique conditioning exercises that aim to develop the essence of each animal. The first two forms, the Panther and the Tiger forms, focus on developing speed and strength, respectively. The third hand form, the Snake, focuses on the cultivation of Qi, the vital, intrinsic energy that is the focus of the internal martial arts. The primary emphasis of the Crane Form is to develop ligament strength and balance. After developing the four physical essences from the previous forms, a student is introduced to the Dragon Form last to enable a cultivation of spirit, a higher state of awareness. *Panther Form - Panther Form movements are quick and agile, representing the essence of speed. *Tiger Form - The characteristics of the movements in the Tiger form are strong and explosive, representing the essence of strength. *Snake Form - The Snake Form cultivates chi through the development of soft strength by imitating the flowing motions and relentless nature of a snake. *Crane Form - Ligament strength, balance, and calmness exemplify the spirit that the Crane form seeks to develop. Compared to the relentless nature of a Snake, the character of a Crane is composed, in a state of stable balance. Its strikes are quick, strong, and deadly accurate even though its body remains in stillness. *Dragon Form - Dragon form represents the pinnacle of physical and mental development. The focus of the form is to elevate the spirit to a higher state of awareness where conscious thoughts and self-awareness no longer matter. Physical actions and reactions become instantaneous, without conscious efforts. = Weapons Forms = The weaponsHasayfu Forms Hasayfu Kung Fu Association used in Hasayfu Hung Gar contain not only the common Southern styles weapons such as butterfly swords, chain whips, and trident. The style also has certain weapons that are peculiar to Hasayfu such the Thunder Hoe, Heaven General Nine-Point Rake, Double Gan, and Double Tiger-Head Shields. Weapons fall into two categories: farming and military. Farming weapons include: Thunder Hoe, Heaven General Nine-Point Rake, Dragon-Head Wooden Bench, and the Tiger Fork or Trident. Military weapons include: Broadsword, Butterfly Swords, Staff, Monk's Spade, Double Gan, and Kwan Do. = Sparring Forms = Hasayfu Hung Gar incorporates sparring forms in the training not only to demonstrate the intended applications of the movements in the solo forms but also to bridge the gap between solo form practices and free sparring. These include Round Shield and Butterfly Sword versus the Trident, and Four-Gate Sparring Form, Staff vs. Butterfly Swords Sparing Form, Empty-Hand vs. Butterfly Swords Sparring Form, Trident vs. Round Shield and Butterfly Sword Sparring Form, and Three-Person Staff Sparring Form, Three-Person Weapon Sparring Form. = Iron Palm Training = In Hasayfu Hung Gar, Iron Palm Training is aimed at toughening the hands and increasing the striking power. Five different hand strikes are used in the training following the sequence: slap, backhand slap (a downward palm strike), knife-hand chop (a downward knife-hand strike), push (a snapping strike forward using the heel of the palm), and grab (includes both a strike and a pull with a tiger claw).

Railway time was progressively taken up by all railway companies in Great Britain over the following seven years. The schedules by which trains were organised and the time station clocks displayed were brought in line with the local mean time for London or \\"London Time\\", the time set at Greenwich by the Royal Observatory, which was already widely known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

The key goals behind introducing railway time were to overcome the confusion caused by having non-uniform local times in each town and station stop along the expanding railway network and to reduce the incidence of accidents and near misses, which were becoming more frequent as the number of train journeys increased. The railway companies sometimes faced concerted resistance from local people who refused to adjust their public clocks to bring them into line with London Time. As a consequence, two different times would be displayed in the town and in use, with the station clocks and the times published in train timetables differing by several minutes from that on other clocks. Despite this early reluctance, railway time rapidly became adopted as the default time across the whole of Great Britain, although it took until 1880 for the government to legislate on the establishment of a single Standard Time and a single time zone for the country.Davies, Peter E \\"History of Railway Time\\" - Reproduced from original article on http://www.carnforth-station.co.uk/ - Retrieved March 4, 2008. Some contemporary commentators referred to the influence of railway time on encouraging greater precision in daily tasks and the demand for punctuality.  Historical background  Until the latter part of the 18th century, time was normally determined in each town by a local sundial. Solar time is calculated with reference to the relative position of the sun. This provided only an approximation as to time due to variations in orbits and had become unsuitable for day-to-day purposes. It was replaced by local mean time, which eliminated the variation due to seasonal differences and anomalies. It also took account of the longitude of a location and enabled a precise time to be applied. Such new-found precision did not overcome a different problem: the differences between the local times of neighbouring towns. In Britain, local time differed by up to 20 minutes from that of London. For example, Oxford Time was 5 minutes behind Greenwich Time, Leeds Time 6 minutes behind, Carnforth 11 minutes behind, and Barrow almost 13 minutes behind.Greenwich mean time - Railway time , Accessed 14-10-2011 In India and North America, these differences could be 60 minutes or more. Almanacs containing tables were published and instructions attached to sundials to enable the differences between local times to be computed.Walker, Phil - Sundial Website \\"Inscription attached to Sundial - Lilleshall Shropshire, England\\" - Retrieved March 4, 2008. Before the arrival of the railways, journeys between the larger cities and towns could take many hours or days, and these differences could be dealt with by adjusting the hands of a watch periodically en route. In Britain, the coaching companies published schedules providing details of the corrections required. However, this variation in local times was large enough to present problems for the railway schedules. For instance, Leeds time was six minutes behind London, whilst Bristol was ten minutes behind; sunrise for towns to the east, such as Norwich, occurred several minutes ahead of London. It soon became apparent that even such small discrepancies in times caused confusion, disruption, or even accidents.  Influence of the electric telegraph  The electric telegraph, which had been developed in the early part of the 19th century, was refined by William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone and was installed on a short section of the Great Western Railway in 1839. By 1852 a telegraph link had been constructed between a new electro-magnetic clock at Greenwich and initially Lewisham, and shortly after this London Bridge stations. It also connected via the Central Telegraph Station of the Electric Time Company in the City of London, which enabled the transmission of a time signal along the railway telegraphic network to other stations. By 1855 time signals from Greenwich could be sent through wires alongside the railway lines across the length and breadth of Britain.Science Museum - Making of the Modern World \\"Railway Time co-ordinated by the Electronic Telegraph\\" - Retrieved March 4, 2008. This technology was also used in India to synchronise railway time.  Introduction of railway time  = Great Britain = Clock on The Exchange, Bristol, showing two minute hands Before the advent of the telegraph, stationmasters adjusted their clocks using tables supplied by the railway company to convert local time to London Time.ICONS of England -DCMS 2007 \\"Stationmasters instructions issued by railway companies\\" - Retrieved March 4, 2008. In turn, train guards set their chronometers against those clocks. The introduction of railway time was in the end swift despite not being straightforward. The Great Western Railway was the first to standardise its timetable on Greenwich Mean Time, in November 1840. One of the most vociferous proponents of standardising time on the railways was Henry Booth, Secretary of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, who by January 1846 had ordered the adjustment of clocks to Greenwich Mean Time at both Liverpool and Manchester stations. The Midland Railway adopted London Time at all of its stations on 1 January 1846. As a consequence, in February 1846 the town council of Nottingham ordered that the town clocks be furnished with three hands, two indicating local time and the additional one the railway and post- office London time. On 22 September 1847, the Railway Clearing House, set up five years earlier to coordinate the distribution of revenue between railway companies, decreed that \\"GMT be adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it\\". From 1 December 1847, the London and North Western and the Caledonian Railways switched over. By January 1848, according to Bradshaws Railway Guide, the railways that had adopted London Time included the London and South Western, the Midland, the Chester and Birkenhead, the Lancaster and Carlisle, the East Lancashire and the York and North Midland. It was reported that by 1855 that 98 percent of towns and cities had transferred to GMT. On the other hand, not all railway companies convinced the local dignitaries to bring their clocks on public buildings in line without stern resistance. Although by 1844 the Bristol and Exeter Railway was running to London Time, the public clocks at both Exeter and Bristol operated to local time but showed London Time by a second minute hand, 14 and 10 minutes ahead, respectively, of its companion. In Exeter this situation arose due to the reluctance of the Dean of Exeter Cathedral to concede to the demands of the railway company, the cathedral clock being the principal timekeeper for the city. Similarly, the clock at The Bristol Exchange installed in 1822 subsequently had a second minute hand added.Brunel 200 Victorian Bristol: a guide to Victorian buildings in the city Brunel 200 Creative Bristol, Retrieved February 28, 2010 Bristol did not solely recognise railway time until September 1852.Eleven Minutes - Lost Time Pieces Brunel 200 Legacy, Retrieved 28 February 2010 It was not for a further eight years and the arrival of the electric telegraph that railway time was the sole time recognised in these towns and others in the West Country, including Bath, Devonport and Plymouth. Another town that stood its ground was Oxford where the great clock on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford had two minute hands.Prerau, David - Institute for Dynamic Educational Advancement \\"Standard Time Begins in Britain - Toms Tower Christ Church, Oxford\\" - Retrieved March 4, 2008. It was not until 2 August 1880, when the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act received the Royal Assent, that a unified standard time for the whole of Great Britain achieved legal status. = United States of America = One of the first reported incidents which brought about a change in how time was organised on railways in the United States occurred in New England in August 1853. Two trains heading towards each other on the same track collided as the train guards had different times set on their watches, resulting in the death of 14 passengers. Railway schedules were co-ordinated in New England shortly after this incidentSmithsonian's NMAH - Anniversary Exhibition Press Release 1999 \\"Railway Accident and Standard Time in America\\" - Retrieved March 4 Numerous other collisions led to the setting up of the General Time Convention, a committee of railway companies to agree on scheduling.White Matthew, W - Wharton Business School, Univ of Pennsylvania - March 2005 \\"The Economics of Time Zones\\" - Retrieved March 7 In 1870 Charles F. Dowd, who was unconnected with the railway movement or civil authorities, proposed A System of National Times for Railroads, which involved a single time for railways but the keeping of local times for towns. Although this did not find favour with railway managers, in 1881 they agreed for the idea to be investigated by William Frederick Allen, Secretary of the General Time Convention and Managing Editor of the Travellers' Official Guide to the Railways. He proposed replacing the 50 different railway times with five time zones. He eventually persuaded the railway managers and the politicians running the cities that had several railway stations that it was in their interests to speedily adopt his simpler proposals, which aligned the zones with cities' railroad stations. In doing so they would pre-empt the imposition of more costly and cumbersome arrangements by different state legislators and the naval authorities, both of whom favoured retention of local times. Right to the end there was opposition expressed by many smaller towns and cities to the imposition of railway time. For example, in Indianapolis the report in the daily Sentinel for 17 November 1883 protested that people would have to \\"eat sleep work ... and marry by railroad time\\".Ralph R. Hamerla, 2006.An American Scientist on the Research Frontier pp 96-7 - Retrieved March 4 However, with the support of nearly all railway companies, most cities and influential observatories such as Yale and Harvard, this collaborative approach led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on 18 November 1883.

It also required clocks inside railway stations and train schedules to be set five minutes late to allow travelers to arrive late without missing their trains, even while clocks on the external walls of railway stations displayed Paris Mean Time. In 1911, France adopted Paris Mean Time delayed 9 minutes 21 seconds, Greenwich Mean Time without mentioning Greenwich. At the same time, slow railway station clocks were eliminated.French time set back - New York Times archive14px = Germany = In Germany the standardisation of time had started to be discussed in the 1870s. North German railways were already regulated to Berlin Time in 1874. However, it was not until 1 April 1893 that the a law was established by the German Empire \\"concerning the introduction of uniform time reckoning\\" by which all railways would operate and also all aspects of social, industrial and civil activity would henceforth be strictly regulated. = Italy = Italy was newly unified as a country when on 12 December 1866 at the start of the winter season the railway timetables centred on Turin, Verona, Florence, Rome, Naples and Palermo were synchronised on the time in Rome, which although it would remain notionally at least under French military control until 1870, was seen as the heart of the nation. In addition to the adoption of a single railway time there was a progressive standardisation of time for civil and commercial purposes. Milan came in line straight away, Turin and Bologna on 1 January 1867, Venice on 1 May 1880 and Cagliari in 1886.Parmeggiani, Gianluigi - Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna \\"The origin of time zones\\" - Retrieved March 17, 2008. = Ireland = Ireland and France were the only countries that decided not to officially adopt Greenwich Time, reflecting the political sensitivities of the time. Dublin mean time was set 25 minutes behind London time, although it came into line with international standard time in October 1916 when summer time ended, and most railway clocks were adjusted by 35 minutes rather than one hour. A slight variation was in railway stations in Ulster such as Belfast and Bangor where clocks displayed on the same dial both Dublin mean time (railway time for the island of Ireland) and Belfast Time (local time), 23 minutes and 39 seconds behind Greenwich.BBC Northern Ireland An Idea Whose Time Had Come..Ellen Hanna Elder Retrieved April 29, 2009 = Netherlands = Netherlands Railway time was based on GMT until 1909 when the country adopted 'Amsterdam time' as the standard time, 19 minutes ahead of GMT.

Railway time was introduced on the main railway line between Stockholm and Gothenburg which opened in 1862. Timetables were based on solar time at Gothenburg, the westernmost end of the line. As a consequence passengers and businesses following local time would arrive at the station ahead of the train. There were many private railways that followed local time or their own railway time. On 1 January 1879, a national standard time was introduced across the whole of Sweden, one hour advanced of Greenwich mean time.Fr√∂ken Ur (Speaking Clock) SP Sveriges Tekniska Forskningsinstitut, Accessed 19 June 2015 = Russia = Until 1 August 2018, Russia had a separate railway time, meaning that timetables and tickets on Russian railways followed Moscow Time regardless of local time.Russian Railways - Time tables Starting from 1 August 2018, each station uses its own local time.All change: Russia's odd train time custom finally hits the buffers = India = The Indian railway companies had to contend with different local times as the rapidly expanding routes extended out from Bombay (today Mumbai), Calcutta (today Kolkata), Lahore and Madras (today Chennai). Towards the end of the 1860s the situation became even more confused as the networks linked up. In 1870, to overcome the problems occurring Madras time was adopted for all railways, for two reasons: the longitude of Madras is roughly midway between those of Calcutta and Bombay, and the Observatory there ran the telegraphic service which could be utilised to synchronise station times via the same time-signal system first used in Britain in 1852 to regulate railway time. Madras Time was popularised by its use in Newman's Indian Bradshaw Timetables.Greenwich2000 Limited \\"Indian Railway Time\\" - Retrieved March 4, 2008. However, unlike in Britain, where railway time was rapidly adopted countrywide and evolved not long after into standard time, in India the much larger size of the country and the autonomy enjoyed by Bombay and Calcutta resulted in both Presidencies' retaining local times well into the 20th century. For the remaining part of the 19th century Madras time continued to be used by all railways.IRFC - Indian Railways Fan Club \\"Timekeeping and Indian Standard Time\\" - Retrieved March 4, 2008. Proposals had been put forward for at least one meridian‚Äìbased time zone for India as early as 1884. However, no consensus could be reached until 1906, when a single time zone based on Allahabad was established, and a standard time was introduced, which the railways came in line with. Despite this, Calcutta kept its own time until 1948 and to a lesser extent Bombay continued to unofficially until 1955.Kosambi, Meera: Bombay Time in Intersections: Socio-cultural Trends in Maharashtra p161 (: Orient Longman, 2000)].

The medication provides for immunization against smallpox disease for people determined to be at high risk for smallpox infection.  Background  Smallpox is considered a biological threat. Biological agents are toxins or organisms that can cause illness or death in humans, animals and plants. Exposure can come from an intentional biological terrorist attack, accidental release of the agent, or a natural accident. According to the Cochrane Library, smallpox was eradicated in 1980. However, there has been interest in the development of vaccines due to is possible use as a bioterrorism weapon. Smallpox works in the following way: > \\"Smallpox spreads from one person to another by infected saliva droplets. > The incubation period is 7 to 17 days. The symptoms begin with severe > headache, backache, and fever up to 40 ¬∞C, all beginning abruptly. Then a > rash appears on the face and spreads, the spots become watery blisters > containing pus that form scabs and leave pitted scars when they fall off. > The infected person is contagious until the last smallpox scab has fallen > off, although most of the transmission occurs in the first week. Most people > with smallpox recover, but some do die and the risk depends on the strain of > virus.\\" In 1980, the World Health Organization certified that the naturally occurring smallpox disease was eradicated. According to the FDA, \\"Until ACAM2000 was licensed, Dryvax, manufactured by Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., was the only vaccine licensed by FDA. Routine vaccination of the American public was stopped in 1972 after the disease was eradicated from the United States. However, smallpox has the potential to be deliberately used as a weapon by terrorists. A large proportion of the population has no immunity and fatality rates could be higher than 25% if smallpox were to be released as a bioterrorist weapon.\\"  Smallpox vaccine development  Smallpox vaccine development is now in its second generation. First-generation vaccines were derived from calf-lymph, and include Dryax, APVS, Lancy-vaxina and Lister. Second-generation vaccines are cell-cultured and include ACAM2000 and CCSV. Both Dryvax and ACA2000 come from the New York City Board of Health strain of vaccinia. Dryvax was grown on calf skin and then freeze-dried for storage. Dryvax was first licensed by the FDA in 1931; however, it is no longer manufactured. ACAM2000 is a second generation smallpox vaccine. It comes from a clone of Dryvax which is purified and produced using modern cell culture technology.  ACAM2000 history  Emergent BioSolutions developed ACAM2000 under a contract with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ACAM2000 in August 2007. By February 2008, it replaced Dryvax for all smallpox vaccinations. As of 2010, there were over 200 million doses manufactured for the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile. According to the U.S. FDA, \\"The approval and availability of this second-generation smallpox vaccine in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) enhances the emergency preparedness of the United States against the use of smallpox as a dangerous biological weapon.\\"  Administration of ACAM2000  The ACAM2000 vaccine is produced from the Vaccina virus. Vaccinia is closely related to smallpox. The ACAM2000 vaccine cannot cause smallpox because it does not contain the smallpox virus. Other vaccines containing live viruses include measles, mumps, rubella, polio and chickenpox. The vaccinia virus, when administered, is not dead like other vaccines. It is not administered via a typical shot that is typically given with other vaccines. Rather, a medical professional uses a two-pronged (bifurcated) stainless steel needle. The needle is dipped into the vaccine solution and used to prick the skin several times in the upper arm. The vaccinia virus will begin to grow at the injection site. It will cause a localized infection, with a red itchy sore produced at the vaccination site within three to four days. If the infection occurs, that is an indication that the vaccine was successful. Ultimately, the itchy sore turns into a blister and then dries up. A scab forms and then falls off in the third week, leaving small scar behind.  Risks  Administration of ACAM2000 can pose risks and cause side effects. Most people who have taken the vaccine report normal, usually mild reactions. These reactions include a sore arm, fever, and body aches. Some people may have side effects ranging from serious to life-threatening. According to the FDA-approved prescribing information leaflet, \\"Common adverse events include inoculation site signs and symptoms, lymphadenitis, and constitutional symptoms, such as malaise, fatigue, fever, myalgia, and headache.\\" These reactions are less frequent in people being revaccinated than those receiving the vaccine for the first time. As far as pregnancy goes, it is recommended that the vaccine should be given to pregnant women who have been exposed to smallpox. No contraindications exist to receiving the vaccine in case of an outbreak emergency. \\"Because the risk of maternal serious illness or death, prematurity, miscarriage, or stillbirth from a smallpox infection are greater than the risk of the vaccination, smallpox vaccine is recommended and should be offered to pregnant women in case of an outbreak emergency.\\" References External links * ACAM2000 prescribing information Healthcare in the United States History of immunology Infectious diseases Vaccine Smallpox vaccines Vaccines ","title":"ACAM2000"},{"id":"16057622","text":"Carney Park is inside the upright=1.5 Carney Park is a United States military recreational facility located in the caldera of Campiglione, in the dormant volcano mount Gauro, in the Phlegraean Fields near Naples, Italy.

In 1799 a wealthy citizen of Prague named Leopold Paul founded a manor house and a settlement next to the farm and named it after himself Paulhof (in German) or Pavlov (in Czech).

Her book Mothers and Amazons (1930), was the first to focus on women's cultural history. It is regarded as a classic study of Matriarchy.Brooklyn Museum Dinner party database She was a member of the \\"Arthurians,\\" a group of European intellectuals active in the 1930s, each of whom adopted a name from Arthur's Round Table (Diner was Sir Galahad). Each member undertook to research an area of knowledge hitherto little known to Western culture. Diner set out to document a feminist history of women, and infused her book Mothers and Amazons (M√ºtter und Amazonen) with lyrical and poetic language.  Life  Bertha Diener came from a middle-class family and received a higher education. Against the will of her parents, she married the polymath Friedrich Eckstein, a Viennese scholar and industrialist, in 1898. Like her husband, she was a member of the Vienna Lodge of the Theosophical Society Adyar (Adyar-TG). The couple received in their home at this time such notables as Karl Kraus, Adolf Loos, and Peter Altenberg. In 1904 Bertha left her husband and her son Percy (born 1899) and began her travels which took her to Egypt, Greece, and England. The couple finally divorced in 1909 and Frederick Eckstein died in 1939 at the age of 78. Her 2nd son, Roger (born 1910) was fathered by Theodore Beer, but was placed with a foster family and did not make contact again with his mother until 1936 by letter and in person only in 1938 in Berlin.

Her best-known works were published under the name Sir Galahad, from the knights of King Arthur. Besides her books, she wrote a series of articles for newspapers and magazines and translated three works of American journalists and the esoteric writer Prentice Mulford. Between 1914 and 1919 she wrote Kegelschnitte Gottes, about the situation of women during that period. From 1925 to 1931, she worked on M√ºtter und Amazonen, a women-focused cultural history, based on the work of Johann Jakob Bachofen.

But they are now back together and touring the world. The band now sell books at their concerts which talk about their rise to fame. History The band was formed by ex-Dawn Patrol members Big Jim Brooks (vocals, guitar), Gary Sandford (bass, vocals), and drummer Mick 'Sticks' Robinson. They cited UK Subs, Cockney Rejects, Angelic Upstarts and The Clash as major influences. Signing to the Riot City label, their first release was a contribution to the various artists compilation Carry On Oi. 1982 saw the release of the band's debut EP Have You Got 10p, a song which once saw the band answered by a shower of 10p coins throughout their set. The EP reached number 8 in the UK Indie Chart, and saw the band receive a lot of press coverage, including an interview by Garry Bushell in Sounds. This was followed by the Noise For The Boys EP, and debut album A Touch Of Class, with Paul Griffiths replacing Robinson on drums. Sandford then left the band for a short while, replaced by former 'D.I.R.T.' bassist Paul Quain for the Press The Button EP. When it came to recording the second album Spirit Of Rebellion in 1983, Quain went 'missing' for some months and so Sandford returned to the fold, with the band also acquiring a second guitarist, Kev 'Dynamow' Pallett. This album was produced by UK Subs' Nicky Garratt and achieved a much fuller sound. A further EP entitled 'Public Animals' remained unreleased due to the folding of Riot City Records, and the subsequent splitting up of the band. All four members then went on to form pop/reggae outfit 'The New Hawaiians' for a while before Sandford and Griffiths left to form '4 Minutes to Moscow' with 'Hawaiians' backing singer Karen Schouw on keyboards and 'Tish' on guitar. Brooks went on to form pop/reggae outfit Jo Jo Republic. In 1999 The Ejected reformed, with the original lineup of Brooks, Sandford and Robinson, recording some extra tracks for a best of album which also included the unreleased 'Public Animals' EP. In 2014, The Ejected have reformed again for the TNT festival in Hartford, Connecticut during Labor Day Weekend and recently played at the Rebellion Punk Festival in Blackpool. Sessioning for the band are Sol Silver band members, Jonny Romain (Guitar), Paul Berry (Bass) and Danny Blair (Drums).

In 2004 it was named by the City of Phoenix as one of the Phoenix Points of Pride.  Name  Looking at the pond, through trees Roh≈ç-en is a combination of three Japanese words. Ro means Heron, a bird symbol of Himeji City. Shirasagi-j≈ç, or the White Heron Castle, is a 300-year-old medieval castle in Himeji. H≈ç is the Japanese word for the mythical Phoenix bird Fenghuang. En means garden.  History  Himeji, Japan became a Phoenix Sister City in November 1976 and is one of Phoenix's ten Sister Cities around the globe. Phoenix and Himeji participate in business, governmental, cultural and educational exchanges that promote international goodwill and understanding. The Garden is the shared cultural vision of the cities of Phoenix and Himeji. The Japanese Friendship Garden is a 501(c)3 non- profit organization in partnership with the City of Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department and our Sister City of Himeji, Japan. Landscape architects from Himeji, Japan have made 60 trips to Phoenix and City of Phoenix delegations made five trips to Himeji since 1987. Overall, more than 50 architects from Himeji contributed to the project. The construction cost is estimated at $3.8 million by bond funds and $1.0 million by private donations. The first phase of the garden opened in November 1996. The rest of it opened to the public in 2002. Sister Garden relationship In April, 2017, Roh≈ç-en signed a sister garden affiliation with K≈çko-en, in Himeji. The two gardens will actively promote each other's garden from now on.  Features  A pine tree grown on the largest island of the pond, grown in penjing style. In the background, there is a part of the north bridge, the only convex one from RO HO EN. The garden features more than 1,500 tons of hand picked rock, stone footbridges, lanterns and more than 50 varieties of plants. It includes streams, a 12-foot waterfall, and a Koi pond with over 300 Koi fish. One of the main attractions at the Japanese Friendship Garden is the Japanese Tea House. 3.5 total acres with a koi pond that is 5/8 of an acre. The Garden showcases more than 50 varieties of plants including two varieties of bamboo. The designers chose plant species that can withstand the rigors of a desert environment while still reflecting the serenity of a Japanese Garden. 1,500 tons of rock handpicked from quarries near Jerome, Superior, Congress and Florence line the stream beds, walking paths, lake shore and main lake waterfall.

First made by the Nupe People of West Africa it is a popular snack in Nigeria, Benin, northern Cameroon and Ghana. It is often eaten alone or with a mixture of garri also known as cassava flakes, sugar and water popularly called \\"garri soakings\\". It is also eaten with Hausa koko, fura, kamu; and is sometimes ground and put into salad. It is often ground as used as an ingredient for Suya and Kilishi. Kuli-kuli is a by product of processing raw peanuts into peanut oil.  Ghanaian Kuli-Kuli  Kuli kuli (a groundnut/peanut cake) in Ghana just like in many parts of West Africa is a common crispy snack. The ingredients and shapes used however is not universal throughout the country. In the northern part of the country especially among the Mole-Dagomba people, Kuli kuli is made from the residue gotten from groundnuts during the extraction of groundnut oil. It is mostly found in the Zongo communities in Ghana.  Preparation  To make kuli-kuli, peanuts are roasted and then ground into a paste called \\"Labu\\". The paste is then mixed with spices, salt, and sometimes ground pepper, and occasionally sugar. The paste is stripped of excess oil with water, and made into the desired shape (round balls, cylinders, etc.). Adding potash to the oil increases the boiling point of the oil. This results in oil being extracted from the kuli-kuli so that you have more liquid oil than when you began. Thus heated and fried the shaped peanut paste begins to solidify and harden. It is then removed from the oil and allowed to cool down until ready to be eaten. It has a very long shelf life and is often given to children as a treat or sold in taxi parks by teenage girls to hungry travelers. All aspects of producing and selling the peanut oil and kuli-kuli is 'woman's work'. Quite often women grow the crop, extract and refine the oil, produce the kuli-kuli, carry it to the market, and sell it. In many cultural groups this is 'her money' to spend as she deems fit. A man growing peanuts is more likely to sell his entire crop of 100 kilo bags wholesale. The wholesaler will be responsible for transportation. = Health Benefits = It contains proteins because of the peanuts from which it is made. It also contains Magnesium, Phosphorus and Vitamin E.

David is also known by his Arab name Saif al-Din Muzaffar Dawaud. David and Marc were first met by Andr√© de Longjumeau in 1245 in Tabriz, during his mission to the Mongol realm.Roux, ‚ÄúLes explorateurs‚Äù, p.106 Embassy to King Louis Little is known about the envoys except for their mission. In 1248, the two men were sent by the Mongol general Eljigidei, acting on behalf of the Khan G√ºy√ºk, to meet with Louis IX on Cyprus. King Louis had arrived on the island on November 17, 1248, making preparation for his Crusade. The two envoys met with him on December 20. The speed of their arrival is perhaps because they had been informed of Louis‚Äô journey beforehand, as he had left from Aigues-Mortes on August 25, 1248. They claimed they had received the information from the sultan of Mossoul. The envoys also met with the Papal legate Eudes de Chateauroux. The two envoys brought with them a missive to Louis from Khan G√ºy√ºk . This letter contrasted with earlier Mongol letters, which had been filled with contempt and demands for submission. However, G√ºy√ºk's letter called Louis \\"the great king\\" (\\"maximus rex\\"), and wished him the best for his battles against the Muslims. G√ºy√ºk also asked Louis to respect all the Christian faiths present in the Orient: David and Marc claimed that G√ºy√ºk had been converted to Christianity with 18 other princes by \\"Bishop Malassias\\"Roux, ‚ÄúLes explorateurs‚Äù, p.107The Empire of the Steppes.

They left on the 26th, together with the seven French envoys led by King Louis' envoy, Andr√© de Longjumeau. The group included two other Dominican friars, Jean de Carcassonne and Andre‚Äôs brother Guillaume de Longjumeau; two clercs Jehanz Godriche and Robert de Poissy; and two officers Gilbert de Sens and Herberz le Sommelierz. A more or less independent clerc named Theodule d‚ÄôAcre would also join the group, and later visit Karakorum.Roux, ‚ÄúLes explorateurs‚Äù, p.109 They carried rich presents from the king of France to the Mongol ruler: a scarlet tent-chapel with an embroidered scene of the life of Christ, and precious parcels of the cross of Jesus Christ.

Biography She was born Clara Strouse in Baltimore, Maryland, to Benjamin and Fannie (Kahn) Strouse. Benjamin and his brothers had emigrated from Germany and opened a dry-goods store in Indiana.DeMille. 1998. After graduating from The Baltimore Women's College, now known as Goucher College, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907,Who Was Who in America. 1976. Clara moved to New York City and went into journalism, writing for various popular magazines and devoting time to study the stage. She married Albert Berwanger with whom she had a daughter, Frances Berwanger in 1909. When she began to write, Clara would change her name to Beranger. =Freelance= Using the pseudonym of Charles S. Beranger, her first screen employment was as a freelancer, writing for the Edison, Vitagraph and Kalem companies, to whom she furnished many originals as well as continuities. Her success attracted some attention and she was appointed as a staff writer for the Fox Corporation. She wrote several scripts for the popular child star Baby Marie Osborne as well as a much-praised adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities. Beranger also wrote The Interloper for Kitty Gordon, The Bluffer for June Elvidge and The Mirror for Marjorie Rambeau, though many of these films are considered lost.Lowrey. 1920. With Forrest Halsey, Beranger wrote the stage play, His Chinese Wife, which received good reviews and became one of the successes of the 1919‚Äì1920 season. =Famous Players-Lasky= In 1921, Clara took Frances, then twelve, and migrated to Hollywood to write for motion pictures, where she signed a long contract with Cecil B. DeMille's Famous Players-Lasky; the outfit with whom she is most associated. She wrote or contributed to more than 24 DeMille productions, and produced both Come Out of the Kitchen and Girls for Marguerite Clark; Sadie Love and Wanted: A Husband for Billie Burke; Judy of Rogue's Harbor for Mary Miles Minter; The Fear Market for Alice Brady; The Cost for Violet Heming; Half an Hour for Dorothy Dalton; Civilian Clothes for Thomas Meighan, Notoriety for Bebe Daniels, and the classic Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for John Barrymore. From an interview with Louella Parson in 1922: > I will be out in California when Mr. DeMille begins operations. Under my old > contract I furnished eight continuities a year; now that I work only for > William DeMille I only write four. That gives me an opportunity to see my > work through from the story to the screen. It makes it possible for me to go > over my script scene by scene with the producer, so he can make the picture > with almost no changes. In the old days I had to keep my nose to the > grindstone continually so as to finish the eight pictures in time for the > different directors for whom I was writing.Parsons. 1922. =William DeMille= In 1921 Beranger met her future husband William DeMille and work on the adaptation of Miss Lulu Bett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a young woman who discovers that she's married to a man who is already married. Not as famous today as Cecil, and though most of his silents have been lost, William is still considered one of the silents' most respected directors. Miss Lulu Bett shows a delicate touch in the telling of an impoverished spinster's misfortunes in a small town.Cripps. 1997. William had other affairs including Lorna Moon who had borne him a son out of wedlock, and with another screenwriter, Olga Printzlau; but he genuinely fell in love with Clara who had tolerated it all.Edwards. 1988. In June 1926, William to the surprise of his wife, announced that he wanted a divorce. Anna refused him and took their daughters, Agnes and Margaret, to Europe for a long trip. When the family returned, William announced that he had given up Beranger and would try again with his wife, but this arrangement only lasted about a year. Anna never recovered from the divorce, and took the children to live in New York permanently.Easton. 2000. William DeMille (50) and Clara Beranger (42) would be married in Albuquerque, New Mexico on August 14, 1928 in the drawing room aboard \\"The Chief\\", a transcontinental special train.Time. August 27, 1928. William de Mille states that Beranger wrote all of his screen plays from 1921 - 1928. He writes in his book, Hollywood Saga ; \\"In April, 1928, I had just finished 'Tenth Avenue,' my forty - fifth production and was working on 'Craig's Wife' with Clara Beranger , who had written the screen plays of all my pictures for seven years and continued to do so even after our marriage.\\" . After marrying into the DeMille dynasty, Beranger would continue to write, including Craig's Wife (1928) for Irene Rich and This Mad World (1930) for Kay Johnson. William would lose everything in the Depression and unhappily rely on Beranger to support him, until Beranger asked Cecil DeMille to employ him to write scenarios. =USC School of Cinematic Arts= Baranger would retire from writing pictures in 1934, though she remained a frequent contributor to magazines such as Liberty and Good Housekeeping, and writer of inspirational books. Beranger's largest impact would be as one of the original faculty of USC School of Cinematic Arts which had begun in 1929 as a collaboration between the University of Southern California and Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.USCCA HomePage. Also among the original faculty were actors Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, directors D.W. Griffith and Ernst Lubitsch, and producers Irving Thalberg and Darryl Zanuck. Cecil would endow the Drama Department, to which William would be appointed as Director, at last allowing him to exploit his education and skills as a teacher and director.

The head of Belfast City Council has been styled Lord Mayor of Belfast since 1892. Lord Mayors The right to appoint a Lord Mayor is a rare honour, even less frequently bestowed than city status; a Lord Provost also acts as Lord Lieutenant of their city. Currently, only the cities of Belfast and Armagh have a Lord Mayor, with the latter being conferred with the honorific title by the Queen as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. =Mayoresses and Lady Mayoresses= The wife of a male Mayor is called the Mayoress and accompanies him to civic functions. A female Mayor or an unmarried male one may appoint a female consort as Mayoress.

Newry Historic District  The National Register of Historic Places also lists a historic district of Newry. The borders of the Historic District differ somewhat from the borders of the CDP.  History  Captain William Ashmead Courtenay (1831-1908) served in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in the Civil War, and was the mayor of Charleston, South Carolina from 1879‚Äì1887. Courtenay and a group of investors formed the Courtenay Manufacturing Company in 1893 with an initial capitalization of $134,500. The company purchased of land along the Little River in Oconee County on June 1, 1893. The company dammed the Little River to power the mill constructed on the site. They also constructed a village of about 50 cottages, and the mill began manufacturing cotton cloth on June 14, 1894. Captain Courtenay's father emigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1791. It is traditionally believed that Courtenay named the village after his ancestral home of Newry which was a small industrial village at the time. The company owned the houses in the town, expanded from the original 50 cottages to about 85 residences, two churches, and a combined post office and company store, during the period from 1893 to 1910. The mill was immediately profitable, giving its investors a 15% rate of return in its first year of operation. Following Courtenay's death in 1908, his sons managed the mill until approximately 1920. In 1946, the Courtenay Manufacturing Company merged with Anderson Cotton Mills, Panola Mills, and Grendel Mills to form a corporation called Abney Mills. Abney Mills continued operations at the mill in Newry, but sold the houses of the community to their residents in 1959. In 1972, the earthen Little River Dam was constructed and Lake Keowee was filled. Newry's baseball field was destroyed to make way for the dam. Abney Mills closed the Newry mill in July 1975. Some of the employees and town residents left to work at other Abney Mills factories. The village lost many residents. In 1980, Newry's population was estimated to be 250.

History The Red Hearts, initially called The Thieves, were formed by Lenny Pops in 2004 after the breakup of The Snakes. Pops' framed the band as a minimal mod/punk three piece backed by Nina Cole and Hethur Suval. He changed the band's name to The Red Hearts. The band played many local shows around Los Angeles and Long Beach, and made it as far north as San Francisco in the first few years of its existence. In mid-2006, The Red Hearts were approached by Matt Friction of The Pink Spiders to be one of the first singles distributed by his new Mean Buzz Records label. Shortly before the release of the Mean Buzz single, both Cole and Suval left the band. Pops decided to continue the band and recruited Richie Cardenas on drums and Daniel Clodfelter on bass. To add an extra dynamic to the new lineup, Pops also got Dan Collins of The Shakes to join the band full-time (he contributed Farfisa to the Mean Buzz single) on Farfisa organ. With the new line-up, The Red Hearts developed a faster, more raw sound and energetic live show. In November 2006, Cardenas left the band to play in the Portland, Oregon based, Clorox Girls. Following Cardenas' departure the Red Hearts went through a series of drummers, including Eric Tretbar, ex-Rat Bastards (pre-Devil Dogs) and Funseekers; and Justino Polimeni, who had previously backed Arthur Lee and Sky Saxon. Kirk Podell is the band's current drummer. After Podell joined the band, The Red Hearts embarked on a tour of the Southern States traveling as far east as Atlanta, Georgia in September 2007. The band released a new single, \\"Let's Get Lost\\" on the French label, April 77 Records, in April 2008. Past projects Pops is a former member of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and also played with Blake Miller of Moving Units in a band called Spectacle (which toured with the BJM).

John Bowen's grandfather was an Inspector of Police in Calcutta. At the age of five and a half he was placed on a boat in Bombay and sent back to Britain where he was brought up by his uncle Donald and aunt Dolly in Whitehaven. Bowen was sent to board at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Crediton in Devon, where he developed an interest in literature and drama. In 1939, his mother returned to England with her three younger children, Patricia (b. 1926) and twins Daphne and David (b. 1930), and rented a house near Crediton. In 1940, having read about the bombing of Britain in The Times of India, Bowen‚Äôs father sent a cable to his wife saying \\"Bring the children out\\", though no bombs had fallen in or near Crediton. The whole family returned to India, where Bowen spent an unhappy year living in the YMCA in Calcutta and working in a semi-clerical job. Eventually he told his father that when the war was over, he wanted to go to university at either Oxford or Cambridge, and that he had better acquire some sort of qualification. So, in 1941 he left his job and went to study at the Jesuit-run North Point College in Darjeeling, where he was awarded the Intermediate Arts degree of the University of Calcutta. At the age of 18, much to his chagrin, he was drafted into the army, and during the latter part of World War II, served as a captain in the Maratha Light Infantry until 1947, serving as a Railway Transport Officer in transhipment stations in Bengal. In 1948, he returned to Britain to study at the University of Oxford (at Pembroke College and St Antony's College), where he gained an MA in modern history, and edited the university magazine, Isis. After graduating, Bowen won a Fulbright Scholarship and spent a year teaching and hitch-hiking through the USA. Bowen returned to Britain in 1953, moved to London and spent three years as an assistant editor on The Sketch magazine. He then turned to advertising, and while working at J. Walter Thompson (1956-58), he was part of the team that launched the successful marketing campaign for Rowntree's \\"Have a break, have a Kit-Kat\\", which is still used to advertise the product. It was during this period that he wrote his first three novels, two of which were published by Faber & Faber: The Truth Will Not Help Us (1956) is about a political witch- hunt; After the Rain (1958, later adapted for the stage) is set in the future and following a group of people attempting to survive a flood; and The Centre of the Green (1959) focuses on a family torn apart by their son‚Äôs marital infidelity. After the Rain was performed at the Duchess Theatre in London and the John Golden Theatre on Broadway in 1967, starring Alec McCowen in the lead role. In 1960, after leaving the comfort of the full-time job, Bowen and fellow advertising copywriter Jeremy Bullmore began writing together using the joint pseudonym of Justin Blake. Their character, Garry Halliday was picked up by the BBC, who commissioned them to write a children‚Äôs adventure serial for television which starred Terence Longdon in the title role. Halliday was a pilot (not unlike Biggles) who found himself solving crimes and overcoming villains. The three TV series became immensely popular and spawned five spin- off novels. From the early 1960s, Bowen mainly focused on writing for television, including contributions to series such as Front Page Story (1965), The Power Game (1966) and seven episodes of the 13-part thriller The Guardians (1971). In 1963, he met the actor David Cook, who had been cast in a minor speaking role in one of Bowen's television plays. Bowen and Cook began a romantic relationship which lasted for 52 years; the couple split their time between the flat they shared in South Kensington and their cottage in rural Warwickshire. Largely thanks to Bowen's encouragement, Cook also turned to writing and became a successful novelist and screenwriter in his own right. During the 1970s and 80s, Bowen continued writing and producing for television, including ITV Play of the Week, Armchair Thriller, the same network's Playhouse and Weekend Playhouse. He also adapted Shakespeare‚Äôs Julius Caesar as Heil Caesar in 1973 and wrote a television remake for ITC of the film Brief Encounter (1974), which starred Richard Burton and Sophia Loren. Bowen was a prolific writer for the stage. I Love You, Mrs. Patterson (1964) concerned the romantic entanglement of a student and his teacher‚Äôs wife, and Little Boxes (1968) consisted of two one-acts, the first about aging vaudevillians and the second about the attempts of a young lesbian couple to conceal their affair. The Disorderly Women (1969) was a modernization of Euripides' The Bacchae. The Corsican Brothers (1970) was based on the story by Alexandre Dumas p√®re, and the production at the Greenwich Theatre starred Bowen's partner David Cook alongside Gerald Harper. Bowen returned to writing novels in the 80s: Squeak (1983) written from the point of view of a pigeon Bowen and David Cook had tended from a chick; The McGuffin (1984) - a Hitchcockian thriller - was dramatised for television in 1986 by Michael Thomas; The Girls (1986) is a dark story of village life set near his rural Warwickshire home. In the mid 1990s, the BBC commissioned Bowen and David Cook to create the TV detective drama Hetty Wainthropp Investigates, based on Cook's 1988 novel Missing Persons. The character of Hetty Wainthropp was loosely based on Cook's mother, Beatrice, and was portrayed by Patricia Routledge alongside Derek Benfield as her long-suffering husband Robert, and Dominic Monaghan as her sleuthing side-kick, Geoffrey. Following David Cook's death from pancreatic cancer in September 2015, Bowen remained in their Warwickshire home, cared for by Cook's nephew and his husband. Bowen died on 18 April 2019, aged 94.

It is a single-seat biplane of conventional configuration, with staggered, single-bay equal-span wings braced with N-struts. The undercarriage is of fixed tailwheel type. The fuselage is fabric-covered welded steel tube, and the wings fabric-covered wood. Plans for the biplane remained available until 1972, by which time some 7,000 sets had been sold. The prototype is now preserved at the EAA Aviation Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The prototype was constructed by students at St. Rita of Cascia High School, Chicago and first flew in 1960.

The player takes the role of the captain of the submarine seaQuest DSV 4600, and is tasked with carrying out a series of missions in a series of levels, divided up as \\"ocean quadrants\\". There is a seaQuest DSV game for the Game Boy as well, but it is completely different from the home console versions. Gameplay The game is divided into two parts; one in which the player controls the seaQuest in an isometric perspective overworld and is able to buy equipment and weapons and travel the ocean quadrant, and horizontal scrolling shooter style missions, in which the player must achieve various objectives using a complement of mini- subs, robots, and a trained dolphin wearing an aqua-lung. Some of the missions are simplistic and require the player to make use of only one of the seaQuest's vessels; others have the player make use of several of them in succession. For example, there's a mission in the first ocean quadrants where the player must rescue the crew of an exploration vessel trapped in a caved-in underwater cave, and has to use armed subs to clear several cave-ins before they can bring in the only mini-sub that's equipped to rescue personnel from other subs. The missions also typically involve combat between the player's mini-subs and the units of pirates, eco-terrorists, and other foes, but also more often than not require the player to perform some sort of non-combat task such as the aforementioned rescue operation. The other part of the game is the overworld where the player controls the seaQuest herself. These areas give the player access to several menus in which they can replace lost equipment, buy new weapons for the seaQuest, and read up on the various missions received while in that quadrant. While traveling a quadrant, the player comes across minefields, automated torpedo launchers and hostile submarines, many of which the player needs to destroy in order to achieve missions. For example, there's a mission in which the player is to seal the leaks in an oil tanker sunk by ecological terrorists. In addition to accomplish this objective with the mini- subs, the player needs to not only complete the mission itself, but also to use the seaQuest herself to sink every terrorist submarine near the oil tanker wreck. The game features a currency system, and awards the player money for destroying enemy targets and completing objectives. The player can also lose money for destroying underwater settlements and killing animals present in some missions. Money is spent on weapons, countermeasures and mines for the player's seaQuest submarine, as well as replacements for lost vessels in missions. The player has no need to spend money on repairs, though, as the seaQuest and her complement subs repair themselves over time. Production The various designs from oldest (left) to newest (right) as used in the game. THQ worked directly with the computer graphics team at Amblin Entertainment to make the seaQuest DSV game accurate and realistic to the designs seen in the series. Several of the original unused concept designs for the seaQuest (seen right), as well as concepts for the renegade pirate submarine Delta IV that was featured in the series pilot movie, were used in the game as enemy capital ships. Marketing for the games included a large print campaign in comics and gaming magazines like Electronic Gaming Monthly, EGM2, Nintendo Power and Game Players as well as several sci fi and fantasy magazines, such as Starlog and Omni. Reception The SNES version was reviewed by Nintendo Power in their February 1995 issue. They gave the game a 3.2/5 rating. It was later featured in the \\"Classified Information\\" section of issue 75 and 82 of Nintendo Power. Game Players gave the SNES version an 88 out of 100. GamePro gave it a positive review, praising the intellectual challenge, the variety in how each of the five vehicles has different controls and purposes, and the 3D graphics effects on the ships. The Sega version got 82 out of 100 in February '95 issue of Game Players. Video Games & Computer Entertainment gave the SNES version a 6 out of 10 in their January 1995 issue. Next Generation reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you have both systems, the SNES version is far superior. But Genesis owners won't be disappointed (unless they play the SNES first like we did).\\" References External links * Moby Games page for seaQuest DSV Sega Genesis games 1994 video games Super Nintendo Entertainment System games 1995 video games Malibu Interactive games THQ games Video games with isometric graphics SeaQuest DSV Video games based on television series Submarine simulation video games Science fiction video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"SeaQuest DSV (video game)"},{"id":"16058434","text":"Edward Hay (1761‚Äì1826) was the author of a book on the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and a witness to many of the events of that time. Early life Edward Hay was born, about 1761, at Ballinkeele (near Crossabeg), Co. Wexford, Ireland, into a Catholic family. His family were large landowners and were long-established in the County. Hay was educated in France and Germany. His father was Harvey Hay. Ballinkeele house and estate was sold in 1825 to the Maher family, who shortly afterwards replaced the old Hay home with a new house. Rebellion Hay was witness to many of the events in Wexford town during the Rebellion. Hay's brother, John, was a prominent Rebel leader, who was executed near the end of the Rebellion on Wexford bridge, 26 June 1798. John Hay was buried in Kilmallock graveyard, Co. Wexford. Another brother, Philip, was a member of the British Army, and was buried in England. Edward Hay was tried for involvement in the Rebellion, but was acquitted. It is clear from Hay's own account and from Miles Byrne's Memoirs that Edward Hay himself had little involvement in the actual fighting, but his actual role is in organizing and promoting the Rebellion is far less certain. Book Hay's book was first published in 1803 as \\"History of the Insurrection of the County of Wexford, A. D. 1798\\". This was one of the first accounts of the Rebellion. It was reprinted many times, usually under the slightly altered title of \\"History of the Irish insurrection of 1798\\", presumably to appeal to a wider audience. Most of these reprints omit Hay's 1803 Introduction and Appendix, as well as his large fold-out map of Co. Wexford. Hay's original 1803 book is now scarce, but is now available on the Internet - less the map. However, an exact copy of his map was reprinted in Wheeler and Broadley's, \\"The War in Wexford: An Account of the Rebellion in the South of Ireland in 1798\\" (London & New York, 1910). Dublin Hay lived in Dublin in later years and was a prominent member of the Catholic Committee and a very active member of the Catholic Association. He was Secretary of the Catholic Association, 1806 - 1819. Biographies Margaret √ì'h√ìgartaigh has produced both a thesis and a biography of Edward Hay. The Wexford historian, William Sweetman, published a biography of Edward Hay in 2019 Death Edward Hay died at Dublin, 13 October 1826, and is buried in St. James' graveyard, Kilmainham, Dublin, where his headstone can still be seen.

The series was published by Hillman Periodicals from 1944 to December 1951, and ran for 32 issues, in three volumes. The series is most notable for showcasing some early funny animal work of legendary comic book writer/artist Jack Kirby, who provided two characters for the book, Lockjaw the Alligator and Earl the Rich Rabbit. The main feature concerns a living marionette named Punch, who is created by a genial toymaker named Uncle Tony, and the puppets best friend, a blonde haired girl named Judy. The strip draws for inspiration more from Pinocchio than typical Punch and Judy puppet performances. The artist on the first issue and the probable creator of the series was Joe Oriolo, who had recently worked for Fleischer Studios and created Casper the Friendly Ghost. Other features include Fatsy McPig, Captain Catfish and Buttons the Rabbit. One feature notable for its racist overtones is Little Horsefeathers, a humor strip about a hapless Native American boy, in the ‚ÄúLittle Hiawatha‚Äù mode. All Hillman periodical publications are in the public domain, and have been often reprinted by various companies, including Eclipse Comics with Airboy and The Complete Jack Kirby reprints. The comics entered the public domain 28 years after their first printing, and the copyrights were never renewed for the second term of 28 years available.3 Due to either a publishing error or the vagaries of publishing issue number 9 of volume one does not seem to exist, but issues 8 and 10 do.
