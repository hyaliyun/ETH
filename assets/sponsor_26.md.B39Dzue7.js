The Synchronistic Kinglist names one Burna-Buriy√•≈° as the 10th Kassite ruler and a contemporary of I≈°me-Dagan II, who is separated from Puzur-A≈°≈°ur III by 42 regnal years.

He has published a variety of books and reports on the topics of children's rights, child participation, indigenous children and gender equality. He holds a PhD in Social Policy from the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom, a Master of Advanced Studies in Children‚Äôs Rights from University of Fribourg-UIKB, Switzerland, and a Master of International Relations. Dr Patricio Cuevas-Parra Biography Dr Patricio Cuevas-Parra was born in Chile. He holds a PhD in Social Policy from the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom, a Master of Advanced Studies in Children's Rights from the University of Fribourg-UIKB, Switzerland, and a Master of International Relations. Patricio has worked in more than 20 countries, including long-term roles in Ecuador, Chile, Indonesia, Lebanon, Cyprus and the United Kingdom. At present, he is the Senior Global Policy Adviser for Child Participation and Rights with World Vision International where he leads strategies and programmes to ensure that children and young people are at the centre of the advocacy process and policy debate. Mr Cuevas-Parra manages research and information analysis on social justice issues affecting children and young people and assesses relevant national laws and regulations in light of international frameworks and instruments. He then translates his findings into social programmes and policies to improve the quality of life of children in developing countries. Within this area, much of the focus of his work has been to increase public awareness of the problems that affect children and young people, such as discrimination, social exclusion, injustice, violence and inequality. As part of his role, he has advised, designed and implemented advocacy and peace-building strategies focused on promoting the participation of the poorest and most excluded and discriminated against populations to influence social justice and public policy changes in multi-religious and conflict-prone contexts. His work, in particular, how to ethically and meaningfully engage children and young people in research, draws from the intensive specialist training he undertook as part of his Childhood Studies at the University of Edinburgh. Patricio also has a strong base in Social Policy from his studies at the School of Social and Political Science, University of Edinburgh, supported by the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships (CRFR). Mr. Cuevas-Parra has published widely on children and human rights related subjects, most notably on child participation, empowerment, voice, citizenship and gender equality. In particular, his publications include studies on the situation of women in Aceh, Indonesia after the 2004 Asia tsunami, the state of children's rights in Lebanon 20 years after the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and child participation manuals for practitioners. His latest publication is titled Child-Led Research: Questioning knowledge and co-authored with Professor Kay Tisdall from the University of Edinburgh. Mr Cuevas-Parra has a keen interest in looking at cutting-edge child rights advocacy tools and models to enhance children and young people's engagement in decision-making. He facilitated the engagement of 35 children to produce an unprecedented child-led alternative report on child rights issues that was submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Universal Periodic Review, in 2010. Patricio also led participatory processes where children were given spaces to write books about their personal stories based on the principles outlined in Article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Children used these publications to influence their communities, stakeholders and government officials in order to contribute to a more just society. Furthermore, post-tsunami, he created gender-sensitive workshops for single parents in Indonesia, which aimed to empower people to embrace the idea that everybody can be a great mother or father, despite the cultural conditioning that exists in most male-dominated societies. The workshops were developed to support the position that the stability and quality of role models are more important than people's gender. Mr Cuevas-Parra won the 2008 World Vision Award for Innovation in Advocacy for his determination and coordinated actions to end violence against children and to place children and young people at the forefront of advocacy and child protection efforts. He was also awarded funding from the Ministry General Secretariat of Government of Chile to lead a study on children's perceptions of their rights. Later, he was awarded more funding by the Government of Chile to explore the views of indigenous children.  Research  Cuevas-Parra's research interests focus on understanding children and young people's lives. He has a particular interest in exploring innovative and participatory methodologies to engage children and young people in decision-making processes. His research falls into four main categories: * children and young people's perspectives on violence and abuse * children's rights and participation in public policy and decision-making * child-led research: methodologies and impact * children and young people's identities and inequalities  Selected research projects  * ‚ÄòChild activists for ending child marriage: Exploring children‚Äôs experiences in Bangladesh‚Äô (2018‚Äì19) with Kay Tisdall (University of Edinburgh) * ‚ÄòChildren advocating for their children‚Äôs rights: A study from the Children‚Äôs Council in Lebanon‚Äô (2013-2014) * ‚ÄòWhat do children think?

The eastern side of the valley is called Domleschg. The region is named after the Heinzenberg Castle near the village of Pr√§z.  Geography  Heinzenberg with Pr√§z The Heinzenberg area extends for about 10 km from south to north, and is bounded on the west by the Heinzenberg Ridge and on the east by the Posterior Rhine. The slope rises very gently (with a 15 to 20 percent grade), especially in the southern part, and offers good conditions for agriculture. There are meadows and pastures around the villages and on the lower slopes, and fields and fruit trees. Higher up the slopes, there is a zone with Maiens√§sses. Above , Alpine meadows can be found. Duke Henri of Rohan praised the diverse landscape exuberantly as \\"the most beautiful mountain in the world\\". The substrate of the area consists mostly of B√ºndner schist, providing little resistance to erosion. The geology of the area is dominated by subsidence and minor landslides. The Nolla brook, which forms the southern border of the Heinzenberg area, dug itself a deep ravine within a few decades at the end of the 18th century and was feared because it often caused floods in Thusis. It took extensive control structures to stabilize the situation. The Porteiner Tobel also shows extensive erosion damage. The Heinzenberg Ridge begins in the south with the 1848 m high Glas Pass, a historically significant bridle path connecting Thusis to the Safien valley. A trail exists along the ridge, which provides nice views of the valley. The highest points along the trail are L√ºschgrat (2179 m), Tguma (2163 m) and Pr√§zerh√∂hi (2120 m). To the west, the ridge falls off abruptly into the Safien valley.  Municipalities  The largest villages are Thusis and Cazis at the bottom of the slope at about 700 m above sea level. Slightly higher (850 to 1000 m) are the villages of Masein and Tartar. Higher still (1140‚Äì1270 m) are the villages of Urmein Flerden, Portein Sarn and Pr√§z. The highest community is the typical Walser scattered settlement Tschappina at 1400 to 1600 m. Use of the German language spread from Thusis to the smaller villages, displacing the Sutsilvan dialect of the traditional Romansh language almost completely. Today only a handful of elderly people in the more remote parts of Heinzenberg (in particular Pr√§z) speak Romansh. All communities joined the Reformation in the 16th century, except Cazis. The ten municipalities together form the Kreis (\\"sub-district\\") of Thusis. Until 1 January 2001, the Kreise of Thusis, Domleschg and Safien formed the district of Heinzenberg. Today, the Kreis of Thusis is part of the district of Hinterrhein.  Transport  From time immemorial, the Posterior Rhine valley was a transit area on the route from Chur to the Alpine passes of the Spl√ºgen and San Bernardino. Today, transport arteries exist on both sides of the river: the highway A13 on the Domleschg side, and the Rhaetian Railway on the Heinzenberg side.

They are colloquially known as FiSTers, regardless of whether they are members of a FiST (Fire Support Team). The Battalion Fire Support Officer (FSO) is the Officer in Charge of a Battalion Fire Support Element. U.S. Army Forward Observers in the U.S. Army hold the Military Occupational Specialty of 13F for enlisted and 13A for officers designating them as members of the Field Artillery corps.

Members of Forward Observer teams are required to attain and maintain a Secret security clearance due to the requirement for Forward Observers to be aware of not only the mission of their own unit but of other U.S. and allied units in the same operating area.http://www.armywriter.com/NCOER/13F-duty-description.htm Officers are referred to as Fire Support Officers (FSO) while enlisted troops hold the title of Forward Observers. Calling in and Adjusting Artillery Fire on a Target Once training is complete members are assigned to a Forward Observer Platoon generally part of a Headquarters and Headquarters Company inside a larger Infantry, Cavalry, Armor, or Artillery Battalion. Observer teams are expected to be able to move, communicate, interact and carry out missions as members of these units with a high level of proficiency in addition to their responsibilities as Forward Observers. Observers must be able to work independently for long periods of time and, because the clandestine nature of their work and their frequent placement on or behind enemy lines, the ability to operate with minimal support is of great importance as some missions can often last for days or weeks. Currently three methods of directing artillery fire are taught in the U.S. Army. The first and most common is called a Grid Mission where artillery fire to directed based on the map grid coordinate of the target based on a standard map. The second is Shift From Known Point where artillery based on his direction and distance from a fixed, pre-established geographic or man made point. The third and least common is Polar where the observer gives their current grid location and provides distance and direction to the target. This is typically unpopular due to the FDC confusing the observer's location as the target.http://dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp3_09.pdf Combat Observation Lasing Teams(COLTs) are a sub-specialization within the Army's 13F career field which train in the directing of long range fire such as rocket assisted artillery or GPS guided munitions like the 155mm EXCALIBUR series weaponry. They have a secondary spotting/reconnaissance capability and are trained to operate with other unconventional forces such as sniper and scout teams for long periods of time with minimal support. These COLT teams are now uncommon and rarely used. Since 2003 the U.S. Army has also used the RQ-7B Shadow Unmanned Aircraft, flown by soldiers in the 15W MOS, in Iraq and Afghanistan for artillery correction, close air support and reconnaissance.. With the need for coordinated indirect-fire support control at higher levels, Fire Support Specialists are also assigned to the ‚ÄúFire Support Element,‚Äù at the battalion level, and as the \\"Fires\\" section of the Operations Staff from brigade/regiment level through to the corps level. Field Artillery Forward Observer 1189 Field Artillery Forward Observer 1189 was a World War II Army Officer position. Officer Classification, Commissioned and Warrant Military Classification and Coding (War Department Technical Manual TM 12-406) The primary duties of the 1189 was \\"Direct the fire of an artillery unit from a forward position. Observes shell bursts and adjusts fire by forward observation or computation methods; consults with commanders of supported unit in determination of appropriate artillery targets, normal barrage, and zones of defense; trains personnel in procedures of artillery operation; organizes observation posts; sets up and maintains communication systems.\\" U.S. Marine Corps The requirements for USMC observers are nearly identical to their Army counterparts. They attend training at Ft. Sill, are required to obtain a secret security clearance, and are generally assigned as specialist members of larger combat units or specialized units like Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company. The main difference is USMC observers are required to show a higher level of proficiency in directing naval gunfire, a skill which their Army counterparts are only required to have a general familiarity with.https://www.thebalance.com/marine-corps-enlisted-job-descriptions-3345364 U.S. Navy The U.S. Navy has a small corps of Naval Gunfire Liaison Officer trained to provide observation and correction of naval gunfire in support of Army and Marine Corps ground units during amphibious and coastal operations. As early as 1921 the United States Marine Corps identified Naval Gunfire as one of the six key elements for amphibious operations. The trajectory of high velocity naval artillery was significantly different from field artillery howitzers typically used for gunfire support. Infantry officers were surprised by the inability of flat trajectory naval guns to hit targets behind low hills; and the relatively wide distribution of fall of shot along the axis of fire sometimes endangered friendly troops behind or in front of the target. Shells intended to penetrate armored ships produced a relatively small damage radius against unfortified targets; and shipboard observation devices designed to observe shell splashes at sea were unable to determine whether their shells were striking intended shore targets. Although Marine Corps officers who have served aboard warships are more familiar with naval artillery, Army officers without such experience are often in positions requiring gunfire support during amphibious landings. Naval officers familiar with shipboard guns are able to advise infantry officers ashore concerning the capabilities of naval artillery to engage specific targets. The naval officer's familiarity with shipboard communications systems enables him to translate the infantry objectives and fall of shot observations to the appropriate shipboard personnel for effective engagement of targets. The tentative manual of 1934 became Fleet Training Publication 167 in 1938; and the Army issued a field manual with virtually identical text in 1941 The use of Naval Gunfire Support reached its peak during WWII with the numerous amphibious landings, to include a small number who completed the Army's elite Airborne School and parachuted into Normandy to provide gun fire support for paratroopers during the D-Day landings.Band of Brothers In the modern age NGLOs are assigned to a Marine Artillery Battalion or Marine Artillery Regiment to assist in providing naval gunfire support. When deploying as part of a Marine Expeditionary Unit, the NGLO is typically attached to the Operations Section (S-3) of the Ground Combat Element and is responsible for a Shore Fire Control Party consisting of RT Operators and Forward Observers.NAVMC 3500.42_ Tactical Air Control Party Training and Readiness Manual While NGLOs are trained to spot Naval Gunfire, their primary responsibilities are in the Fire Support Coordination Center to plan and coordinate naval gunfire with other firing agencies (artillery, close air support, and mortars) in conjunction with the Fire Support Coordinator and Fire Support Team Leaders, and advise him on its employment. NGLOs can also be assigned to Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Companies (ANGLICO), or the various Marine Expeditionary Force or Division Headquarters staff.How to Become a Artillery Or Naval Gunfire Observer Specific training consists of the Naval Gunfire Liaison Officer Course, a five-week resident course taught in Coronado, California. NGLOs assigned to ANGLICO units may receive further training as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs) at the discretion of the assigned unit and are Jump qualified. U.S. Air Force Although the U.S. Air Force has no formal forward observer training of its own, members of the Special Tactics community are generally required to have a basic familiarity with techniques of call for fire and artillery spotting in addition to their normal duties. The closest thing the Air Force has to a Forward Observer is a JTAC, whom specializes in air support. They are also referred to as TACP. Close Air Support. United States Department of Defense, 2014 Joint Fires Observer The Joint Fires Observer (JFO) course is a two-week course which provides select personnel from all branches of the military with standardized and certified training to engage targets with joint fires through the detailed integration with Terminal Attack Controllers (TACs) and Fire Support Teams (FSTs). Students who graduate this course will be able to request, control, and adjust joint mortar, Field Artillery (FA), and Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) systems; provide targeting information for A-10, AC-130, and other Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft, Terminal Guidance Operations (TGO), Initial Terminal Guidance (ITG) operations, SOF gunship call for fire, Close Combat Attack (CCA) and joint fire support planning at the company level. Additionally a JFO is trained in controlling multiple ground and air based fire support assets at the same time, ensuring the different assets are deconflicted by time, lateral or vertical space, or a combination of the two tactics.http://www.public.navy.mil/fltfor/ewtglant/Documents/courses/cin/JFOC.html JFOs in the Army and Marine Corps are typically officers or enlisted Forward Observers or special operations who are awarded the L7 additional skill identifier, or ASI, is becoming a valued ability to combat brigades headed overseas. The first certifying JFO course was established at Nellis Air Force Base in 2004. It was then moved to Fort Sill in 2006, and also Einsiedlerhof, Germany at the Warrior Preparation Center. The Marines have also established their own JFO course in Quantico, VA.https://www.army.mil/article/88014/Joint_Fires_Observers_make_battlefield_impact/ The JFO course consist of 7 Graded Sim's with numerous Fire Missions and CAS missions. In these SIM‚Äôs you will conduct Mortar, Artillery CFF missions, Naval gun CFF, Attack Aviation and SOF CFF mission, CAS with JTAC or FAC(A). Consisting of night optics, laser guided bomb (GBU12) , JDAM (GBU 38), Hellfire, Rockets, with LLDR or just a map, protractor and compass. Sim 1 Perform an Adjust Fire mission and provide targeting information directly to an aircraft controlled by a TAC for CAS mission using Type 2 control. Sim 2 Execute visual target marking for CAS. Sim 3 Execute sensor target marking for CAS. Sim 4 Conduct call for fire missions. (SOF and Attack Aviation) Sim 5 Integrate with FAC(A) during CAS mission. Sim 6 Coordinate CAS target engagement as Non-JTAC. Sim 7 It is a random mixture of these 6 Sims as the Final evaluation. (1 CFF mission and 2 CAS missions). After the completion of these SIM's with no more than 3 NO GO's and a passing rate on the written exam of 80 percent or higher, only then are you awarded the L7 and certification approval of JFO ASI.

Many different species of mammal can be classified as cats (felids) in the United States. These include domestic cat (both house cats and feral), of the species Felis catus; medium-sized wild cats from the genus Lynx; and big cats from the genera Puma and Panthera. Domestic cats vastly outnumber wild cats in the United States. Prehistoric cats At least 67 species of sabertoothed cats existed in North America between 42 million and 11 thousand years ago before going extinct. Their disappearance can be attributed to both the changing climate at the end of the Ice Age and the appearance of humans in the Americas. Some prehistoric animals referred to as \\"saber-toothed cats\\" were in fact marsupials and not cats at all, but called such because of their resemblance to true felines with large canine teeth. Big cats Two main species of big cat once inhabited the United States. One is the jaguar (Panthera onca), which is related to many species of big cat found on other continents.Though there are single jaguars now living within Arizona,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona- science/2017/03/02/rare-jaguar-spotted-mountains-arizona/98641298/ the species has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century, although it is found throughout most of South America, its territorial limit being lands further south than northern Argentina. The other North American 'big cat' is the cougar (Puma concolor), which is also known as the puma, mountain lion, catamount, and many, many other names. Despite weighing 70 kg. (150 lbs) on average and being called a 'mountain lion,' the cougar is not a member of Panthera and is more closely related to the domesticated cat than it is to lions. Cougars can be found throughout South America, Mexico, the western half of the U.S., and southwestern Canada. They once also roamed eastern North America, but are now confined to Florida in the U.S. Wild cats A bobcat on the Calero Creek Trail near San Jose, California. Three mammal species in the United States are referred to as \\"wild cats\\": the ocelot, the Canadian lynx, and the bobcat. However, none of these animals belong to Felis, the genus of the wildcat proper and the domestic cat. The ocelot is in the genus Leopardus, small spotted cats that mostly inhabit Middle and South America, while the lynx and bobcat are both in the genus Lynx. A smaller cat than any of the above, the Jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi), although mostly found in Central and South America, also occurs near the lower Rio Grande Valley in the southern tip of Texas. Being a near relative of the American cougar, the Jaguarundi is more closely related to true wildcats then the other cats mentioned here. Domestic cats The domestic cat, Felis catus or F. silvestris catus, is a popular pet, with an estimated 93.5 million cats kept as pets; about one third of all households in the United States keeping at least one. Eighty-seven percent of owned cats are spayed or neutered The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not require a certificate of health for cats brought into the United States, but cats are subject to inspection at ports of entry and may be denied entry. Cats must be quarantined regardless of place of origin when brought into Hawaii and Guam. Organizations Various organizations using the term Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and in United States all organizations using the name SPCA are independent; there is no umbrella organization. Some of the more notable organizations include: * American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals * New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals * Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Monterey County, California * San Francisco SPCA The National Cat Groomers Institute of America is an organization devoted to training and certifying people in the grooming of cats. Headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, it was founded in 2007 by Danelle German, the organization's current president. Cats Indoors! is a public education campaign by American Bird Conservancy and supported by the National Audubon Society and other conservation organizations to encourage control of cats in order to protect birds from predation by cats. The objective of the conservancy's campaign is that all domestic cats should be kept safely indoors.

Crull was deposed by Warren Commission assistant counsel Leon D. Hubert, Jr. on July 14, 1964 in Dallas. Early life and education Crull was a native of Louisville, Kentucky. He briefly attended Ohio's Western Reserve Academy and Indiana's Culver Military Academy. For higher education, Crull first matriculated at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana for the 1926-27 academic year. Already before enrolling at Purdue, Crull had shown an interest in becoming a newspaper reporter and was familiar with the work that Walter Williams had done to promote journalism, including the founding of the Missouri School of Journalism. That interest prompted Crull to transfer to the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri in 1927 to enroll in the school that Williams had built. There he worked on the student newspaper and was an active member of Kappa Sigma fraternity.http://www.e-yearbook.com/.../University_of Missouri.../Page_332.html-Cached\\"a,b,c,d\\" Who's Who in AmericaVol. 34 (1966-67).

Crull's biography had first appeared in this publication in 1952; and prior to that in Who's Who in the South and Southwest Career After the University of Missouri, Crull came to Dallas, Texas in 1931 to become a reporter for the Dallas Journal. He quickly rose to become a senior reporter and was in that capacity when the Dallas Journal merged with the Dallas Dispatch in 1938. Because he covered the city beat, Crull came to the attention of James W. Aston, Dallas's city manager at the time who hired him to become his assistant. From 1942 to 1946, Crull served as a U.S. Air Force officer with the rank of major and spent more than half of his time in the service with the management control staff of the Pentagon. He returned to Dallas to assume his old job. This time serving under Roderic B. Thomas. When Charles C. Ford became the city manager in 1951, Crull became the assistant city manager and thereafter city manager when Ford resigned. In 1966, he resigned to become both a vice-president of the Howard Corporation and the Republic National Bank (First Republic Bank Corporation), retiring from both positions in late 1974. Crull died in Dallas's Parkland Hospital in 1976 after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, Katherine Virginia Galbraith. City manager Curry was an assistant city manager or city manager in Dallas for over 25 years. For fourteen years (1952‚Äì1966), Crull was Dallas' city manager, holding the position during the administration of four mayors: J.B. Adoue, Jr., R.L. Thornton, Earle Cabell, and Erik Jonsson. \\"This was a time when Dallas experienced its greatest growth under Crull's tight efficient government. He is credited with creating a series of capital improvement programs which resulted in extensive public works projects: The present city hall, Dallas Memorial Auditorium, Love Field Terminal and much of the city's major thoroughfares were among the projects completed while he was in office\\". Jesse Curry, who became Chief of the Dallas Police Department in January 1960, was appointed to the position by Crull.

The ¬º-mile speedway operated from its opening in 1977 until it was sold in 2002. The site of the Motordrome is now warehouses and light industrial factories. History Even though Motorcycle Speedway was started in the Hunter Region of NSW in Maitland in 1923, and motorcycle racing was held at the still operating Newcastle Showground racing as early as 1919, it wasn't until 1973 with the opening of Jerilderee Park Speedway, later to become the Newcastle Motordrome, that Newcastle had a dedicated speedway track that wasn't a showground although there was a short-lived 1/2 mile showground Speedway track at Hamilton in Newcastle as early as 1926 and Midget cars often made the trip from Sydney to Newcastle to race at a Speedway track on Union St. The Motordrome was originally opened as Jerilderee Park Speedway and run and promoted by Peter Gurbiel, who also ran the Tralee Speedway in Australia's capital city Canberra, and quickly became the centre of speedway racing in country NSW with the track hosting many Australian Championships including the Australian Sprintcar Championship (1983), Australian Solo Championship (1989), Australian Speedcar Championship (1995/96), Australian Sidecar championship (1991), Australian Super Sedan Championship (1980/81, 1989/90 and 1995/96) as well as hosting the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix in 1999, various NSW State championships and rounds of the World Series Sprintcars. Events at the Motordrome, especially for the Sprintcars, Solo Test matches with Australia facing visiting teams such as England and various \\"Rest of the World\\" teams, and big Sedan tests against visiting American teams often brought in capacity crowds of 15,000 people proving the popularity of the sport in the region. Categories to regularly run at the Motordrome during its 25-year existence were Sprintcars, Speedcars, Super Sedans, Solos, Sidecars, Grand National Sedans, Compact Speedcars and Litre Sprints The speedway originally had a dolomite and clay mix surface, but was paved during the early to mid-1980s before the asphalt was dug up and the original surface was restored. During the time the track was asphalt a smaller motorcycle track was placed on the infield, the track running just inside asphalt track, but when the asphalt was dug up the bikes once again raced on the \\"D\\" shaped main track. The Motordrome was also the site of the first ever visit by an official sporting team from the USSR to the Hunter Region of NSW when on 8 December 1990 the Russians took on a strong NSW team in what was known as the Tooheys International Solo Challenge. Led by captain Rinat Mardanshin, Oleg Kurguskin, the late Rif Saitgareev, and runner up in the 1990 Under-21 World Championship Rene Aas, it was the Soviet's first defeat on their 1990/91 Australian tour as they came up against a NSW lineup including Newcastle's own 1990 World #3 Todd Wiltshire, as well as that season's Australian Solo Champion Craig Boyce and 1989 Australia #2 Stephen Davies. Despite being undefeated on their Australian tour to that point after meetings in North Queensland and the Northern Territory, the Russians were expected to lose heavily to the almost test strength NSW but were in the challenge right up until the final heat of the night when Wiltshire and Boyce shut out Kurguskin and Saitgareev 5‚Äì1 to give NSW a hard-fought 49‚Äì41 win in trying (damp) conditions. Other famous competitors to race at the Motordrome during its life included World of Outlaws legend Steve Kinser of the USA, his brother Randy and cousin Mark, Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Rutherford, as well as Australian speedway legends Bernie Whalan Garry Rush, George Tatnell and his son, Brooke Tatnell, Max Dumesny, Steve Brazier and his son Garry Brazier, brothers Ron and John Pyne from nearby Kurri Kurri, Grenville Anderson, Billy Sanders, Phil Crump and Leigh Adams. The Newcastle Motordrome, originally known as the Jerilderie Park Speedway, was also known during its lifetime as the Newcastle International Motordrome. Due to sponsorship the venue was also known as the Winfield Newcastle Motordrome and finally the Wynn's Newcastle Motordrome. In a sport where death or severe injury is often an accepted risk (especially to the motorcycle racers), the Newcastle Motordrome bucked the trend and never saw a fatal accident, though in 1975, when the speedway was still Jerilderee Park, it was where the career of the 1954 and 1959 Speedway World Champion Ronnie Moore of New Zealand ended when he crashed and was in a coma for several weeks after. The speedway held its last meeting on Sunday 14 July 2002 after promoter David Lander sold the freehold for the site for a reported A$2.5 million to the ATB Morton development group ending 25 years of successful speedway at the venue.

It was notable for a play in which spectators at Denver's Mile High Stadium disrupted a 49ers field goal attempt by throwing snowballs from the stands. Game summary Denver scored first with a 3-yard touchdown pass from John Elway to Gene Lang. San Francisco failed to mount any offense on their first three possessions, gaining a total of only 27 yards. Quarterback Joe Montana was sacked twice, for losses of 9 and 10 yards respectively. They were eventually able to answer with a Ray Wersching field goal in the second quarter. Elway threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Steve Watson, and a second 49ers field goal attempt was disrupted by fans, leaving the Broncos up 14‚Äì3 at halftime. The 49ers had more success in the third quarter, with a touchdown pass from Montana to Mike Wilson, and a Wersching field goal. They took the lead in the fourth quarter with another field goal, but Rich Karlis' 24-yard field goal with 1:27 left gave Denver a 17‚Äì16 victory. The snowball On their last possession of the first half, the 49ers mounted a nine-play drive which ended in a 19-yard field goal attempt. Before holder Matt Cavanaugh received the snap from center, a snowball thrown from the stands landed just in front of him. Distracted, he mishandled the football and was unable to hold it for kicker Ray Wersching. In desperation he picked up the ball and attempted a forward pass, but there were no receivers downfield and it fell incomplete. No penalties or palpably unfair acts were called, and the Broncos took over on downs. They went on to win 17‚Äì16, making the failed field goal a pivotal factor. After the game, referee Jim Tunney explained, \\"We have no recourse in terms of a foul or to call it on the home team or the fans. There's nothing in the rule book that allows us to do that.\\" He ordered an increase in stadium security at halftime, and no further incidents occurred. Cavanaugh later said, \\"I saw the snowball. It broke my concentration. I'm not sure if I got the ball back up in time to kick it, but there must not have been time because Ray decided not to kick it.\\" 49ers center Randy Cross said, \\"I saw the snowball explode right after I snapped the ball. The ball and the snowball hit right at the same time. It definitely made a difference.\\" Broncos coach Dan Reeves said, \\"I don't condone the snowball throwing. There is no place for that kind of activity in pro football. I hope we don't ever see that again.\\" He also expressed doubt that it had disrupted the play, saying \\"I don't think that Cavanaugh thought it affected him because if it did, he'd still be standing there arguing with the official right now\\", and \\"I think if you shot me with a 30.06 when I was a holder ‚Äì you've still got to catch that football.\\" New York Giants general manager George Young called it \\"a disgrace when you have a game that's decided on something like a snowball.\\" On November 13, Broncos management announced new policies to eject, prosecute, and revoke the season tickets of any fans found throwing snowballs at Mile High Stadium. On November 14, NFL rules committee chairman Tex Schramm opined that officials should have intervened, saying \\"to me, the referee should have killed the play right at that instant, regardless of what happened to the kick.\\" The San Francisco Examiner offered $500 for an interview with the snowball thrower. A young man (whose name was not disclosed by the paper) came forward on November 15, apologizing for the incident and refusing the money.

Biography He was the son of Maremar, dean of the Sura Yeshiva Academy. His rulings are mentioned in the Talmud,Babylonian Talmud, Kethubot 80b and so are his halakhic habits. For example, he would tell his assistant to hire a laborer to work for him, while committing Judah himself to pay the worker. Since the employer was not same person as the wage payer, there was no danger of accidentally violating the commandmentDeuteronomy 24:15 of paying one's workers on time.Bava Metzia 111a He was highly respected by his peers. Once when Rav Papa was marrying his son to the daughter of Abba of Sura, and wanted to visit Abba's house to discuss Abba's dowry payment, Papa met Judah bar Meremar. Papa invited him to come in, but Judah refused, explaining that he did not want Abba of Sura to be ashamed because of him, and therefore would give his daughter more than he truly wished. At Papa's further urging, though, Judah agreed to come. When Abba of Sura stated the dowry's amount, Judah said nothing. Abba thought Judah was silent out of anger that the dowry amount was too small, so he added vast amounts to the dowry. When he saw that Judah was still silent, he said to Judah: \\"I left myself nothing, and you still want me to give more?\\" Judah replied: \\"What you gave is already against my opinion, in my opinion you did not have to give so much, but since you already gave - you should not retract.\\"Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 52b Once he ate together with Mar bar Rav Ashi and R.

It came into force on 20 June 2002, and was effectively repealed on 17 April 2009 by the Fifteenth Amendment. Provisions The amendment inserted Schedule 6A, entitled \\"Loss or retention of membership of Municipal Councils, after a change of party membership, mergers between parties, subdivision of parties and subdivision and merger of parties, and filling of vacancies\\", into the constitution. This schedule allowed municipal councillors to cross the floor without losing their seats, but only during certain window periods. Councillors could also only cross the floor if at least one-tenth of the representatives of the party they were leaving did so during the same period. The permitted floor-crossing periods were to occur from the first to the fifteenth of September in the second and fourth years after each nationwide municipal election; such elections occur every five years. One was also to occur in the fifteen days immediately after the amendment came into force, but as a result of a court challenge this period was suspended until October. The floor-crossing periods that occurred before repeal were therefore 8‚Äì22 October 2002, 1‚Äì15 September 2004, and 1‚Äì15 September 2007. Legislative history The amendment was introduced to Parliament as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Bill, part of a package of four bills dealing with floor-crossing. The others were the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Bill, which became the Ninth Amendment, the Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures Bill, which purported to allow floor-crossing in the national and provincial legislatures, and the Local Government: Municipal Structures Amendment Bill, which dealt with consequential effects of municipal floor-crossing. The amendment was passed by the National Assembly on 11 June 2002 with 280 votes in favour, more than the requisite two-thirds majority. As a constitutional amendment not involving provincial matters, it did not have to be passed by the National Council of Provinces. It was signed by President Thabo Mbeki on 19 June and came into force on the following day, at the same time as the Ninth Amendment. The provisions inserted by the Eighth Amendment were repealed on 17 April 2009 by the Fifteenth Amendment. Formal title The official short title of the amendment is \\"Constitution Eighth Amendment Act of 2002\\". It was originally titled \\"Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 2002\\" and numbered as Act No. 18 of 2002, but the Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, 2005 renamed it and abolished the practice of giving Act numbers to constitutional amendments.

Background and education Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh is a member of a noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh. He was born in Diriyah in 1948 and was educated by his father, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh former Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia.

These reforms envisaged the creation of specialized courts to operate in parallel with the traditional sharia courts, particularly in areas of commercial litigation.

Al ash-Sheikh announced in July 2008 that he had submitted a plan of action for the judiciary reforms to the King, but little was heard further until it was announced in 2009 that he would cease to be minister of justice in a major cabinet reshuffle. He was replaced by Muhammad bin Abdul Karim Issa as justice minister on 14 February 2009. It was reported that King Abdullah's objective in the reshuffle was to replace conservative incumbents with younger, more progressive candidates.

She had four masts and was a two-funnelled steamer long, with a crew of 167, and capable of carrying 1,204 passengers. However, she had a short service history, being lost in what is remembered as one of the most impressive and memorable shipwrecks on the coast of the Back of the Wight, a region on the Isle of Wight, England. Wreck On 31 January 1892, Eider was heading up the English Channel to Bremen through thick fog. Around 10 p.m. the ship ran hard aground on the Atherfield Ledge, a hard outcrop of rock projecting from the large bay of the Back of the Wight. Captain Heinecke jettisoned cargo and called for tugs. The new Atherfield lifeboat approached from a recently established station on the cliffs, but the captain refused her offer of help. The tugs did reach Eider, but a gale had arisen that made it impossible for them to get close enough in case they struck the rocks as well. At 10 a.m. the captain decided to evacuate the passengers; however, it was now too rough for the small Atherfield lifeboat, Catherine Swift, to be launched. The bigger lifeboats located at Brook and Brighstone were launched, but they had much farther to travel. The Brighstone lifeboat, Worcester Cadet, arrived first and carried a dozen women and children to Atherfield beach. The Brook lifeboat, William Slaney Lewis, reached Eider five hours after being launched and rescued another load of women and children. By 2 p.m. the sea had worsened to the point where rollers were reaching over the stern, but by 3 p.m. the water had calmed and the lifeboats were relaunched. All the passengers were saved, but the crew stayed on board. On Tuesday the gale reached storm force and the lifeboats evacuated the crew and bullion from the now badly holed and sinking vessel. Result The rescue brought praise for those involved from all around the world. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) awarded medals to some crew members, and Kaiser Wilhelm II gave each coxswain an engraved gold watch and donated ¬£200 to the RNLI. The ship was later salvaged and declared a total loss.

The series was based on Kyle's British talk series of the same name. The series was taped in New York. The program was a co-production of ITV Studios' U.S. subsidiary, ITV Studios America and Debmar-Mercury, which served as distributor for the U.S. version while ITV kept all international rights. Synopsis As with the UK version, the series used a confrontational style, which saw guests attempt to resolve interpersonal relationship issues, such as family, relationship, sex, drug, alcohol and other issues. \\"Guest Support\\" was provided by psychiatrist Dr Janet Taylor.http://blastzoneonline.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/interview-with-dr- janet-taylor-from-the-jeremy-kyle-show/ The show's style was one of the reasons why Fox and Debmar-Mercury saw potential in adapting Kyle's show to the United States as a replacement for Oprah. By November 2010, the series was picked up in over 70% of American television markets, well ahead of its September 2011 debut.Exclusive: 'Jeremy Kyle' Cleared in 70%-Plus of the Country Broadcasting & Cable Kyle also had competition among three other tabloid talkers, already established veterans (and all distributed by NBCUniversal Television Distribution), The Jerry Springer Show, The Steve Wilkos Show and Maury. Like other tabloid talk shows, Jeremy Kyle aired primarily on affiliates of Fox, The CW and MyNetworkTV. Only a scattered number of ABC, CBS and NBC stations in smaller markets aired it, with only a few using it to fill their former Oprah timeslot. On November 17, 2011, the show was renewed for a second season. Cancellation The Jeremy Kyle Show was cancelled on December 18, 2012, with the final episode airing in May 2013. In a joint-statement to Broadcasting and Cable, Debmar-Mercury co-presidents Mort Marcus and Ira Bernstein said, \\"We can confirm the U.S. version of The Jeremy Kyle Show won't be returning for a third season. This is in no way a reflection of the quality of the show. Backed by a first-rate production team, Jeremy was amazing and showed all of us why he is such a rock star in the UK. Simply put, Jeremy is one of the best hosts we have ever seen, and we expect to see more of him on U.S. television in the years ahead. Unfortunately, talk shows like this simply take time to build and, while we were seeing ratings progress in many markets, it wasn't enough to justify going forward with another season.\\" Initial reception Before its American debut, Broadcasting & Cable writer Ben Grossman noted in his article that his show could be a threat to Anderson Cooper's syndicated talk show, which debuted in the same season (and ran for two years just like Kyle's did), and yet another confrontational tabloid talk veteran, Jerry Springer, whom Kyle replaced back in the UK when Springer's version of his American talk show aired there.\\"Jeremy Kyle\\" by Ben Grossman from Broadcasting and Cable (March 7, 2011) References Category:2010s American television talk shows Category:2011 American television series debuts Category:2013 American television series endings Category:American television series based on British television series Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television series by Lionsgate Television ","title":"The Jeremy Kyle Show (American TV series)"},{"id":"32437492","text":"The Valser Rhine () is a source of the river Rhine in the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden.

It was founded in 1912 by poor Jewish immigrants from what is now Belarus (mostly Minsk), which at the time was part of the Russian Empire. The current Byzantine Revival building was completed in 1930. The congregation has had only three full-time rabbis: Meyer Levy (1916‚Äì1921), Meyer Zimmerman (1940‚Äì1954), and Shmuel Spero, who has served from 1988 to the present. It is the only Orthodox synagogue in Downtown Toronto with a full-time rabbi, and the only one that holds daily services. Founding Anshei Minsk was the first congregation formed in the Kensington Market neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1912, at a time when most of Toronto's Jewish population still lived in The Ward but were moving westward in increasing numbers to the Market and the surrounding area.\\"Anshei Minsk -Early History\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives. Accessed July 16, 2011. The Minsk originated as a landsmanshaft synagogue with its immigrant congregation based on a country, district or city of origin, in this case most of the Minsk's founders were poor Jews from Minsk (in Belarus), who had settled in Kensington Market at the turn of the century. At its founding, it was a shtibel or small storefront synagogue typical of poorer Jewish immigrant communities of the time. The land on which the current synagogue was built is located at 10-12 St. Andrew Street, across the street from what is thought to be the location of the original storefront synagogue. The location was purchased by the congregation in 1913 for $9,000. The two houses originally on the property were used not only as a location for the congregation to worship, starting in about 1916, but also housed up to 14 tenants. By 1923, only the caretaker was domiciled there and by 1925 the property was used exclusively as a synagogue. Synagogue building Funds were raised for the construction of a synagogue building, on St. Andrew Street near Spadina Avenue, designed by Harold Solomon Kaplan & Sprachman. Construction appears to have commenced around 1922 but was a gradual process and it was not until the end of 1930 that both houses were demolished and the current building was completed. The Byzantine Revival\\"Anshei Minsk\\" , Ontario's Places of Worship, Ontario Heritage Trust. Accessed July 18, 2011. building has notable exterior features including twin towers, a large entrance stairway, and a central stained-glass window between the towers. While the lot itself is north-south and the facade is on the south side of the building, the interior layout is designed according to Jewish custom so that the main sanctuary is on the eastern wall so that prayers are directed towards Jerusalem. The eastern wall is punctuated by stained-glass windows, and decorated with painted murals of a lion and an antelope on either side of a window above the ark. The synagogue, which can seat 350 worshippers, was constructed by Jacob (Nahum) Glassman, a Russian immigrant who had started a construction business and the grandfather of journalist Michele Landsberg. Due to the onset of the Great Depression, the congregation was unable to pay Glassman in full for his services and so they offered him a lifetime membership in the synagogue instead.\\"Anshei Minsk -Architecture\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives. Accessed July 16, 2011. Rabbinic leadership Meyer Levy served the congregation as rabbi from 1916 until 1921, after which the cantor led services for the most part until the late 1940s when Rabbi Meyer Zimmerman joined. Following his death in 1954, the members did not hire a new rabbi but instead invited guest rabbis to visit and teach or had the cantor or congregants lead services. The situation remained until 1988 when Rabbi Shmuel Spero was hired as the shul's rabbi, a position he continues to hold today. Recent history Following World War II, Toronto's Jewish population gradually migrated away from the Kensington Market area and north up Bathurst Street. The Minsker became principally a 'businessman's shul' where Jewish businessmen would pray in the morning before work. The synagogue continues to serve older congregants who did not join the northward migration and remained in the area, along with Jewish students at the nearby University of Toronto, tourists, and younger Jews who have moved into the area.\\"Anshei Minsk -Today\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives.

Not content to simply release the piece as a musical endeavor, LCTR has teamed up with acclaimed indie developer Tom Vine and pixel artist Francis Coulombe to create a fully interactive version of the album in which the story unfolds through LCTR's thematic riffs, stirring vocal hooks and progressive virtuosity while the player blasts his way through viscous gameplay inspired by classics such as R-Type, Contra, and Super Metroid.http://prostheticrecords.com/?p=2389#more-23895 However, there has only been a demo released so far, which is the full level of ‚ÄúUpload Complete\\".

In the fields of geometry and biochemistry, a triple helix (plural triple helices) is a set of three congruent geometrical helices with the same axis, differing by a translation along the axis. This means that each of the helices keeps the same distance from the central axis. As with a single helix, a triple helix may be characterized by its pitch, diameter, and handedness. Examples of triple helices include triplex DNA, triplex RNA, the collagen helix, and collagen- like proteins.  Structure  A triple helix is named such because it is made up of three separate helices. Each of these helices shares the same axis, but they do not take up the same space because each helix is translated angularly around the axis. Generally, the identity of a triple helix depends on the type of helices that make it up. For example: a triple helix made of three strands of collagen protein is a collagen triple helix, and a triple helix made of three strands of DNA is a DNA triple helix. As with other types of helices, triple helices have handedness: right-handed or left-handed. A right-handed helix moves around its axis in a clockwise direction from beginning to end. A left-handed helix is the right-handed helix's mirror image, and it moves around the axis in a counterclockwise direction from beginning to end. The beginning and end of a helical molecule are defined based on certain markers in the molecule that do not change easily. For example: the beginning of a helical protein is its N terminus, and the beginning of a single strand of DNA is its 5' end. The collagen triple helix is made of three collagen peptides, each of which forms its own left-handed polyproline helix. When the three chains combine, the triple helix adopts a right-handed orientation. The collagen peptide is composed of repeats of Gly-X-Y, with the second residue (X) usually being Pro and the third (Y) being hydroxyproline. A DNA triple helix is made up of three separate DNA strands, each oriented with the sugar/phosphate backbone on the outside of the helix and the bases on the inside of the helix. The bases are the part of the molecule closest to the triple helix's axis, and the backbone is the part of the molecule farthest away from the axis. The third strand occupies the major groove of relatively normal duplex DNA. The bases in triplex DNA are arranged to match up according to a Hoogsteen base pairing scheme. Similarly, RNA triple helices are formed as a result of a single stranded RNA forming hydrogen bonds with an RNA duplex; the duplex consists of Watson-Crick base pairing while the third strand binds via Hoogsteen base pairing.  Stabilizing factors  The collagen triple helix has several characteristics that increase its stability. When proline is incorporated into the Y position of the Gly-X-Y sequence, it is post-translationally modified to hydroxyproline. The hydroxyproline can enter into favorable interactions with water, which stabilizes the triple helix because the Y residues are solvent-accessible in the triple helix structure. The individual helices are also held together by an extensive network of amide-amide hydrogen bonds formed between the strands, each of which contributes approximately -2 kcal/mol to the overall free energy of the triple helix. The formation of the superhelix not only protects the critical glycine residues on the interior of the helix, but also protects the overall protein from proteolysis. Triple helix DNA and RNA are stabilized by many of the same forces that stabilize double-stranded DNA helices. With nucleotide bases oriented to the inside of the helix, closer to its axis, bases engage in hydrogen bonding with other bases. The bonded bases in the center exclude water, so the hydrophobic effect is particularly important in the stabilization of DNA triple helices.  Biological role   Proteins  Members of the collagen superfamily are major contributors to the extracellular matrix. The triple helical structure provides strength and stability to collagen fibers by providing great resistance to tensile stress. The rigidity of the collagen fibers is an important factor that can withstand most mechanical stress, making it an ideal protein for macromolecular transport and overall structural support throughout the body.  DNA  There are some oligonucleotide sequences, called triplet-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) that can bind to form a triplex with a longer molecule of double-stranded DNA; TFOs can inactivate a gene or help to induce mutations. TFOs can only bind to certain sites in a larger molecule, so researchers must first determine whether a TFO can bind to the gene of interest.  RNA  In recent years, the biological function of triplex RNA has become more studied. Some roles include increasing stability, translation, influencing ligand binding, and catalysis. One example of ligand binding being influenced by a triple helix is in the SAM-II riboswitch where the triple helix creates a binding site that will uniquely accept S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The ribonucleoprotein complex telomerase, responsible for replicating the tail-ends of DNA (telomeres) also contains triplex RNA believed to be necessary for proper telomerase functioning. The triple helix at the 3' end of MALAT1 serves to stabilize the RNA by protecting the Poly-A tail from proteolysis as well as increases translation efficiency, which is ultimately detrimental to humans as MALAT1 is related to lung cancer malignancy.

They play in the Second Ice Hockey League, in the Czech Republic (third -level ice hockey league). The Ice Skating Club was founded in 1876 in P√≠sek. The Ice Skating Club and Sokol have helped to foster sportsmanship enthusiasm of the local inhabitants. When the first hockey sticks arrived to Bohemia in 1892 it didn't take long before this sport equipment appeared also in the South of Bohemia. In terms of P√≠sek the first extant written mention of this new game ( the game of hockey was originally born around 1875 in Canada ) can be found in an article of the Otavan Magazine issue no.47 from 1902. This article introduced the game and recommended it for consideration by the Ice Skating Club at its Annual General Meeting. The period article states : \\"By introducing this game, which in fact may be considered somewhat an alternative to tennis, the Ice Skating Club would be favourably viewed by the ladies, as well as the Club‚Äôs members. It could be possible to assemble several teams and organise interesting matches.‚Äù The first to run games of Bandy Hockey (- the predecessor of the Canadian hockey, which was played with a ball on ice) was the town of Strakonice in 1908. A few years later it was already played in the town ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. At the beginning of the First World War an engineer Karel Proche moved to P√≠sek from Zbraslav. He turned out to be a great promoter of this new sport. He owned two hockey sticks, which he took with him to the pond of H√°novec in winter in 1917 (which, was not very good for ice games at that time). Hockey took off and soon there were many ice-hockey pioneers chasing each other around with curved branches used as hockey sticks. Most of them were originally tennis players. They bought real hockey sticks quickly and after a few trainings on ≈†arl√°k and the river near the swimming pool the players of P√≠sek were about to fight in their first match. The first Czech Champions at that time (1923) were the players from Strakonice, who invited their P√≠sek colleagues to play a match on their home [Strakonice] turf. For the first time before the actual match the hockey players from P√≠sek asked for the explanation of the rules of the game. Then they proceeded to beat the - at that time leading team - with the score of 4:3. It was 20 January 1924 and one of those scoring into the Strakonice‚Äòs net was the attacker Tom√°≈° ≈†vihovec, who later became a well-known ice-hockey personality of P√≠sek of the first half of the 20th century. Bandy, the predecessor of modern ice-hockey, had not managed to take a proper root in the town yet when it was replaced a year later by so called ‚ÄûCanada‚Äú. This was a game played with a plastic puck, something which was met for the first time by the celebrated seven pioneers of Czech ice hockey in 1909 during a match at an international tournament in Chamonix, France. The players of P√≠sek absorbed all that faster than any other teams, who were used to the original game with the ball, and so it did not take long for the P√≠sek team to become unrivalled in this game in the region of Southern Bohemia (despite being initially beaten 4:1 during the first of this type of matches in Strakonice). The first true competition for their team did not appear until the end of the 1920s when the AC Stadium was founded in the town ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. SK P√≠sek was founded in 1910 by merging The Ice-Skating and The Lawn-Tennis Clubs. After their meeting on 15 November 1924 at hotel Dvo≈ô√°ƒçek (nowadays known as ‚ÄûOtava‚Äú) SK P√≠sek extended its activities also to ice. A hockey regional union was established and it became a part of the Czech Ice Hockey Association (ƒåSLH). The representatives of the SK P√≠sek committed themselves to establishing one local ice rink specifically for the ice-hockey game and so nothing stood in the way of the joyous flourishing of ice-hockey. In P√≠sek in the 1930s, apart from the elite members of the SK P√≠sek, one could also see players from other clubs such as the SK Union, SK Slavoj, TC Orinoko, DSK Soko as well as a team made of students from local schools. Despite these teams never reaching up to the quality of the SK P√≠sek team, nevertheless, their contribution to promoting ice-hockey around the P√≠sek region was invaluable. Before the Czech Ice Hockey League was founded in the first half of the 1930s, there were only local competitions and Championships played in a tournament format. SK P√≠sek, for example, won the South Bohemian Championship three times and once became the Champion of the Bohemian Countryside (1929). SK P√≠sek went to the semi-finals of the Czech Master Championship in 1930. In the finals, then the front runner and Master of the Central Bohemia County - the LTC Prague was faced at the end by the AC Stadion ƒåB ‚Äì the Bohemian Countryside Champion of that season. Club IHC P√≠sek was founded in 1990 by merging the clubs of VTJ P√≠sek and JITEX P√≠sek known as VTJ Jitex P√≠sek. In 1994 the Club qualified for the First National ice Hockey League where it stayed until 2005. In the season of 2004/2005, however the Club did not succeed in the Playoffs (in which it had participated for the third time) and so was relegated to the Second League. In 2009/2010 season the Club returned once again to the First League. However in the following season of 2010/2011 the team finished the Postseason in the last (16th) place and after unsuccessful Playoffs for the First League, where the team ended in last 5th place, it was relegated again. Nevertheless, the Club bought a First League License from HC Vrchlab√≠ and once the ownership rights for the license were confirmed on the 15th of July 2011 by the president of ƒåSLH (The Czech Ice Hockey Association) Tom√°≈° Kr√°l, the Club was playing in the First League again in the 2011/2012 season. After some financial issues the Club unsuccessfully tried to qualify from the Regional League to the Second National League. In this it finally succeeded in the 2014/2015 season. After that in the following two years the P√≠sek team always managed to fight their way through the Playoffs of the Second League. Achievements *Czech 2.liga champion: 1994.

Among prominent members of the family is Erasmus B.K. Zahl (1826-1900), a wealthy trader and an island owner () in Kjerring√∏y. In the late 1800s, he gave financial support to Knut Hamsun, then a young and poor author. Later, Hamsun--a 1920 Nobel Literature Prize laureate --used Zahl as a model for the famous character Mack appearing in many of his novels, among others Pan (1894). Anders Nicolai Zahl (1807-1857) of the Nordvika branch married Lorentze Sophie Lie, n√©e Krogh (b. 1797), a daughter of Mathias Bonsach Krogh, bishop of H√•logaland.  Name  Whilst the name in the aspect of orthography is identical with the German word Zahl, which means digit or number, its etymological origin remains unknown or unconfirmed. Among other spellings are Sahl, Saell, and Zal. As the name has been inherited also from mothers through generations, and this to a large extent, the group of past and present name bearers belong to various patrilineally defined families. The two most important branches are that whose paternal line descends from shipper Tomas of Sund in Leirfjord and that whose paternal line descends from trader Hans Olsen Zahl of Nordvika in D√∏nna.

Outside, the show's team, including Connie (Alexandra Staden), Sclezi (Sam Stockman), Big Daddy (Victor McGuire) and Snow (Sean Mcconaghy) begin to lose connection to some of the cameras inside the prison. Sclezi is sent in to fix them, however, he is stabbed in the eye by the Warden. Dixon is set a task, to remain lying in a hole in the ground. Once he is inside the hole, the Warden arrives and locks him in. Connie, Big Daddy and Snow see this, but believe the network had twisted the show to also make them contestants. They let the game continue. Shoe and Randall are set a challenge to eat a meat believed to be human flesh, which they complete. Toni and Stanton are sent to the gas chamber for their task. Stanton locks Toni in a chair in the gas chamber, and puts a gas mask on her. As the chamber fills with gas, Stanton is instructed to find the switch to stop the gas somewhere in the prison. When he leaves, the Warden appears in the chamber and removes Toni's mask. While Randall and Shoe make their way back to base, they come across the Warden, who stabs them to death. As Stanton turns off the gas, the Warden knocks him unconscious. Connie starts to become worried and sends Big Daddy and Taylor into the prison to check up on the contestants. They are soon attacked, and Connie attempts to warn Angel to get out of the prison. Angel believes this to be part of the game, as she has just been given the task to free Toni and Dixon. She enters a cell and finds a knife before the Warden appears with the key. She stabs him with what she thinks is a fake knife, and retrieves the key. She then finds Stanton hanging by his ankles in a cell, but before she can help him, the Warden stabs him in the neck and the abused inmates devour him. Angel flees, and runs into Connie, who has entered the prison. The Warden returns, and as Angel runs, the Warden catches up with Connie. As Connie prepares to be stabbed, two more Wardens, Shoe, Randall, Taylor and Big Daddy reveal the show was a set up, and Connie was the real contestant. After the initial shock, Connie is sent to retrieve Toni, Taylor to get Dixon, and the others to leave the prison. Taylor finds Dixon murdered in the hole, and Connie realizes Toni is dead. The Warden locks Connie in the gas chamber and gases her, while the others are sealed into the prison. Angel manages to escape out of the prison to Snow, having discovered people were being murdered by the real Warden. Snow follows Angel with his camera asking her for a final word; not knowing the rest of the cast and crew are trapped in the prison, Angel responds by breaking his camera.

Sometimes lasting only a few days, these strikes were often \\"marked by almost continuous and often spectacular violent conflict,\\" at times amounting to prolonged riots and weeks of civil insurrection. Following the 1929 New Orleans streetcar strike, less violent strikes persisted for decades, such as the Atlanta transit strike of 1950. The rise of private automobile ownership limited its impact. Tactics Electrified streetcars posed an attractive target for striking unions like the Amalgamated Street Railway Employees of America. Unlike factory buildings, streetcar routes and cars were spread out and difficult to protect. The routes went through the working class neighborhoods of cities; riders tended to be sympathetic to union causes. Their overhead lines and physical tracks were vulnerable to sabotage. And their function as transportation for workers in other industries opened the possibility of leveraging a transit strike into a general strike, as in the Philadelphia trolley strike and riots of 1910. Streetcar strikes rank among the deadliest armed conflicts in American labor union history. Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor called the St. Louis Streetcar Strike of 1900 \\"the fiercest struggle ever waged by the organized toilers\\"Motorman and Conductor, June 1900 up to that point, with a total casualty count of 14 dead and about 200 wounded, more than the Pullman Strike of 1894. The casualty count for the San Francisco Streetcar Strike of 1907 saw 30 killed and about 1000 injured. Despite the transit disruption, which sometimes lasted for months, and despite the fact that many of the casualties were passengers and innocent bystanders, \\"the strikers invariably enjoyed wide public support, which extended beyond the working class.\\" The owners' tactic was simply to keep the routes running. To counter hostile crowds, the line owners turned to strikebreakers. Foremost among them was James A. Farley (1874-1913), who specialized in streetcar strikes‚Äîhe claimed to have broken 50‚Äîand was said to command an army of forty thousand scabs Leslie's Monthly Magazine, Volume 60, May 1905, page 106 to be deployed anywhere in the country. Much of the violence of the 1907 San Francisco strike was attributable to Farley, who reportedly cleared $1 million there. He was doing more than $10 million in business by 1914.The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History by Aaron Brenner, Benjamin Day, Immanuel Ness, page 56  Examples  National Guard soldiers guarding a Kansas City streetcar during a 1918 motorman and conductor strike Examples of American streetcar strikes include: * 1889, Twin Cities, Minnesota * 1891, Detroit, Michigan, where strikers had the vocal support of Mayor Hazen S.

The half-hour series is hosted by comedian Iliza Shlesinger and created by David Garfinkle and Jay Renfroe for Renegade 83 Productions (the same company that produced Blind Date) and CBS Television Distribution. The series, which is primarily syndicated to stations affiliated with Fox, CW, CBS, MyNetworkTV and to independent stations for broadcast in late fringe and access time periods,First-Run Syndie 'Excused' Starts Production, TVNewsCheck, April 21, 2011. is the first dating series (along with Entertainment Studios-produced Who Wants to Date a Comedian?, which debuted the same month) to air in first- run syndication since the 2006 cancellations of Blind Date and Elimidate. On April 19, 2012, CBS Television Distribution announced that Excused would be renewed for a second season, which began on September 10, 2012, but it would also be its last as the series ended its run in September 2013 after 230 episodes.'Excused' Renewed For Second Season, TVNewsCheck, April 19, 2012.from Iliza Shlesinger's Facebook page Format The series utilizes a house in the Los Angeles County city of Encino as its setting for this program. Dating In the first round, two contestants (either two males or two females; for the second season, episodes in which male contestants choose female suitors are less commonly seen) are introduced and are asked by host Shlesinger about what they look for in a mate. Originally, the contestants then had to decide which potential suitors that they wanted to let in by watching a feed from a security camera located outside the front door of the house to give their first impression by explaining why they should be given the chance to date the contestants; often, Shlesinger will give snarky commentary to the potential suitors whether they are chosen to enter the house or not. This round was eliminated beginning in the second season and four suitors are chosen before the show for the contestants to choose from, though Shlesinger's commentary was retained as an element. Once four potential suitors are chosen, the two contestants then view video dating profiles to determine based on their personality and other personal details they reveal as to which two people they will choose to go on to the third round (starting with season two, the contestants' decision whom to excuse in this round and the additional eliminations shown thereafter are now only revealed once that person is announced to have been eliminated, instead of being first revealed by the contestants to Shlesinger shortly beforehand). The group of four is cut down to two remaining potential suitors, who then will go out on dates with the two contestants. The two contestants then will decide which of the two remaining suitors will go on to go out on a one-on-one date with each of the contestants, in which the contestant has to impress their date, before the suitor decides which one of the two contestants they choose to go out on a second date.Celebuzz Gets ‚ÄòExcused‚Äô by New Dating Show Host Iliza Shlesinger (PHOTOS), Celebuzz, September 12, 2011 . Changes in the initial rounds In the first season, the contestants would travel by van to different locations in Los Angeles for the first four dates. In some episodes, the elimination from four to three contestants would take place at the location of the dates in a face-to-face encounter. In other episodes, all eliminations would take place back at the Excused house with the eliminations being announced by Shlesinger over a speaker. The final two dates took place in the Excused house, and one of these final dates would frequently be a hot tub date. For the second season, all dates featured in each episode are taped in the Excused house; as such, all four daters are initially seen together before the first two one-on-one pairings go off on separate dates around the premises. The series also introduced a designated \\"private room\\" within the house, that includes hidden cameras within the room, in which contestants take their dates to a more intimate setting. The Courtyard The show culminates with each contestant choosing whether to meet their suitor in the courtyard of the house. The suitor will go to the courtyard and wait for his or her prospective partner to join him or her. Joining the other outside signifies that the contestants both want to pursue a relationship; contestants who choose they do not want to pursue a relationship with the remaining suitor (either due to the lack of a romantic connection or simply because the contestant sought to be the one chosen and had no actual intention of pursuing a relationship with the suitor), will not appear in the courtyard.

Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing is a computational paradigm for supercomputing on a large number of geographically disperse computers. Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing aims to provide a higher quality of service than opportunistic resource sharing.Computational Science - Iccs 2008: 8th International Conference edited by Marian Bubak 2008 pages 112-113 The quasi-opportunistic approach coordinates computers which are often under different ownerships to achieve reliable and fault-tolerant high performance with more control than opportunistic computer grids in which computational resources are used whenever they may become available.Quasi-opportunistic supercomputing in grids by Valentin Kravtsov, David Carmeli , Werner Dubitzky , Ariel Orda , Assaf Schuster, Benny Yoshpa, in IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing, 2007, pages 233-244 While the \\"opportunistic match- making\\" approach to task scheduling on computer grids is simpler in that it merely matches tasks to whatever resources may be available at a given time, demanding supercomputer applications such as weather simulations or computational fluid dynamics have remained out of reach, partly due to the barriers in reliable sub-assignment of a large number of tasks as well as the reliable availability of resources at a given time.Computational Science - Iccs 2009: 9th International Conference edited by Gabrielle Allen, Jarek Nabrzyski 2009 pages 387-388 The quasi-opportunistic approach enables the execution of demanding applications within computer grids by establishing grid-wise resource allocation agreements; and fault tolerant message passing to abstractly shield against the failures of the underlying resources, thus maintaining some opportunism, while allowing a higher level of control. Opportunistic supercomputing on grids The general principle of grid computing is to use distributed computing resources from diverse administrative domains to solve a single task, by using resources as they become available. Traditionally, most grid systems have approached the task scheduling challenge by using an \\"opportunistic match-making\\" approach in which tasks are matched to whatever resources may be available at a given time.Grid computing: experiment management, tool integration, and scientific workflows by Radu Prodan, Thomas Fahringer 2007 pages 1-4 Example architecture of a geographically disperse distributively owned distributed computing system connecting many personal computers over a network BOINC, developed at the University of California, Berkeley is an example of a volunteer-based, opportunistic grid computing system.Parallel and Distributed Computational Intelligence by Francisco Fern√°ndez de Vega 2010 pages 65-68 The applications based on the BOINC grid have reached multi-petaflop levels by using close to half a million computers connected on the internet, whenever volunteer resources become available.BOIN statistics, 2011 Another system, Folding@home, which is not based on BOINC, computes protein folding, has reached 8.8 petaflops by using clients that include GPU and PlayStation 3 systems.Folding@home statistics, 2011 However, these results are not applicable to the TOP500 ratings because they do not run the general purpose Linpack benchmark. A key strategy for grid computing is the use of middleware that partitions pieces of a program among the different computers on the network.Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing by Guang R. Gao 2010 pages 10-11 Although general grid computing has had success in parallel task execution, demanding supercomputer applications such as weather simulations or computational fluid dynamics have remained out of reach, partly due to the barriers in reliable sub-assignment of a large number of tasks as well as the reliable availability of resources at a given time. The opportunistic Internet PrimeNet Server supports GIMPS, one of the earliest grid computing projects since 1997, researching Mersenne prime numbers. , GIMPS's distributed research currently achieves about 60 teraflops as an volunteer-based computing project. The use of computing resources on \\"volunteer grids\\" such as GIMPS is usually purely opportunistic: geographically disperse distributively owned computers are contributing whenever they become available, with no preset commitments that any resources will be available at any given time. Hence, hypothetically, if many of the volunteers unwittingly decide to switch their computers off on a certain day, grid resources will become significantly reduced.Euro-par 2010, Parallel Processing Workshop edited by Mario R. Guarracino 2011 pages 274-277 Furthermore, users will find it exceedingly costly to organize a very large number of opportunistic computing resources in a manner that can achieve reasonable high performance computing.Grid Computing: Towards a Global Interconnected Infrastructure edited by Nikolaos P. Preve 2011 page 71 Quasi-control of computational resources Representation of an atmospheric model with differential equations that require supercomputing capabilities An example of a more structured grid for high performance computing is DEISA, a supercomputer project organized by the European Community which uses computers in seven European countries.High Performance Computing - HiPC 2008 edited by P. Sadayappan 2008 page 1 Although different parts of a program executing within DEISA may be running on computers located in different countries under different ownerships and administrations, there is more control and coordination than with a purely opportunistic approach. DEISA has a two level integration scheme: the \\"inner level\\" consists of a number of strongly connected high performance computer clusters that share similar operating systems and scheduling mechanisms and provide a homogeneous computing environment; while the \\"outer level\\" consists of heterogeneous systems that have supercomputing capabilities.Euro-Par 2006 workshops: parallel processing: CoreGRID 2006 edited by Wolfgang Lehner 2007 pages Thus DEISA can provide somewhat controlled, yet dispersed high performance computing services to users.Grid computing: International Symposium on Grid Computing (ISGC 2007) edited by Stella Shen 2008 page 170 The quasi-opportunistic paradigm aims to overcome this by achieving more control over the assignment of tasks to distributed resources and the use of pre-negotiated scenarios for the availability of systems within the network. Quasi-opportunistic distributed execution of demanding parallel computing software in grids focuses on the implementation of grid-wise allocation agreements, co-allocation subsystems, communication topology-aware allocation mechanisms, fault tolerant message passing libraries and data pre-conditioning. In this approach, fault tolerant message passing is essential to abstractly shield against the failures of the underlying resources. The quasi-opportunistic approach goes beyond volunteer computing on a highly distributed systems such as BOINC, or general grid computing on a system such as Globus by allowing the middleware to provide almost seamless access to many computing clusters so that existing programs in languages such as Fortran or C can be distributed among multiple computing resources. A key component of the quasi-opportunistic approach, as in the Qoscos Grid, is an economic-based resource allocation model in which resources are provided based on agreements among specific supercomputer administration sites. Unlike volunteer systems that rely on altruism, specific contractual terms are stipulated for the performance of specific types of tasks. However, \\"tit-for-tat\\" paradigms in which computations are paid back via future computations is not suitable for supercomputing applications, and is avoided.Algorithms and architectures for parallel processing by Anu G. Bourgeois 2008 pages 234-242 The other key component of the quasi- opportunistic approach is a reliable message passing system to provide distributed checkpoint restart mechanisms when computer hardware or networks inevitably experience failures. In this way, if some part of a large computation fails, the entire run need not be abandoned, but can restart from the last saved checkpoint.

Heraldic artwork from 1763 in the Sykkylven Church. Mecklenburg, Mechlenborg, and Mikkelborg is a patrician and historically a prominent family living in Denmark and Norway. They descend from Flensburg in today's Germany. Members include Willum Mecklenburg, Feudal Lord of Eiker, as well as several regional bailiffs, militaries, and privileged merchants. The family is closely related to families of the Danish and the Norwegian nobility, and among cognatic descendants of the family are the Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg.  Name and coat of arms  The name has appeared with various orthography and pronunciation, the most important being Mecklenburg, Mechlenborg, and (in Northern Norway) Mikkelborg. The arms are a wild dog running out of a forest [three trees]. The crest is the same dog rampant. The arms have natural colours.  General history  Flensburg (between 1572 and 1618). As a young man Oluf Jensen (b. ca. 1487 in Flensburg) came to the town of Haderslev, where he became a merchant and within short time very wealthy. He married Margrethe Meckelburg, the sister of Henrick Meckelburg, Mayor of Flensburg. Also Jensen himself became this town's mayor. Jensen adopted the name of his first wife, calling himself Oluf Meckelburg. This name was also given to or taken by his children of both marriages. In his marriage with Marina Jacobsdatter Oldendorph, a daughter of Jacob Oldendorph, Mayor of Haderslev, and Elisabeth Holst, Oluf Mecklenburg had the son Oluf Meckelburg (b. 1540). Alike his father Oluf the younger became a merchant;--not in his birth town but in that of his father, Flensburg. He became one of the wealthiest merchant in that town. He traded and exported goods from the royal fiefs (Sleswick and Holsatia), and he had extensive connections to Norway. He married Margrethe Carstensdatter, who belonged to the rural nobility of the region. Her parents were Carsten Rickertsen, Mayor of Flensburg, and Marina Friis af Arlevad (Arlewatt). Their sons Jacob and Oluf Mechlenborg went to Norway, where they became Bailiff of Nordm√∏re and Bailiff of Helgeland, respectively. Their third son, Carsten Mechlenborg, remained in Haderslev, where he was a merchant and also the town's mayor. On the other hand, many of the latter's children moved to Eastern Norway.  Mecklenburg in Eastern Norway  Customs and export secretary Oluf Carstensen Mechlenborg had two sons: Niels Olufsen Mechlenburg, an estate owner, and Willum Mecklenburg, Feudal Lord of Eiker (one of the last in Norway). The two brothers' descendants were married into and have descendants in several families of Danish and the Norwegian nobility, among others Werenskiold, von R√∏mer, de Tonsberg, Huitfeldt, von Hausmann, and the Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg, as well as in non-noble families like Hansten, Hiorth, and Angell.  Mecklenburg in Western Norway  Jacob Olufsen Mechlenborg (ca. 1565-1619) was appointed as Bailiff of Nordm√∏re. His wife was Maren Mikkelsdatter, and the couple had three known sons: (1) Oluf Jacobsen Mechlenborg, Bailiff of Nordm√∏re and a customs and export officer, (2) Niels Jacobsen Mechlenborg, and (3) Johan Jacobsen Mechlenborg.  Mecklenburg in Northern Norway  Hestmann√∏y alias Hestmona, seat of the younger line. Jens Mechlenborg was Bailiff of Helgeland (yellow and green), and his son Oluf Mechlenborg was Bailiff of Lofoten and Vester√•len (red).  The older line  Jens Olufsen Mechlenborg (ca. 1566-1626) came to Trondheim in Norway in 1601 or 1602. His occupation during the first years is not known. It is likely that he worked together with merchants who were or had been partners of his father and his grandfather. Between 1606 and 1619 he was Bailiff of Helgeland, in which office he was succeeded by Peter Jacobsen Falch. His son Oluf Jensen Mechlenburg became Bailiff of Lofoten and Vester√•len. Between 1640 and 1644 he was Bailiff of Helgeland together with Mathias Gregersen Lehmb. In 1665 he was living at Lur√∏y Farm. He was married with Adelus Christensdatter (Schanche),Pedersen, Lorentz U.: Omkring presterekken i Br√∏nn√∏y fra reformasjonen til ca. √•r 1700 in √Örbok for Helgeland, anno 1986. a daughter of Lord Christen Olufsen (Schanche), priest of Br√∏nn√∏y.

According to the ICH Merwede the OWTIS system would have significant advantages over current methods of offshore wind turbine installation. Benefits are said to include offshore safety improvements while installing turbines and also the requirement to do fewer tasks offshore. OWTIS is also said to have environmental benefits as it does not rely upon jacking feet and thus does not actually come into contact with the sea bed, preventing damage. The system would also be capable of operating in very harsh weather conditions and in addition deploying large loads in such conditions. In addition it would be capable of working on projects within the oil and natural gas sectors.

It brought in a law that required candidates standing for election in Northern Irish local and Northern Ireland Assembly elections to declare they would not, by word or deed, express support for or approval of proscribed organisations or acts of terrorism (that is to say, violence for political ends). It had the effect of disqualifying numerous candidates in the 1989 Northern Ireland local government elections, particularly 23 candidates of the Republican Sinn F√©in (RSF).  Background  In Northern Ireland, elections to local government had historically been dominated by the unionist majority due to Catholic nationalist disincentive to take part in elections. In 1974, in order to encourage more Catholic participation the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, Sinn F√©in; which had been designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1956, was removed from the list of proscribed organisations. They then started to gain seats in local government. In 1983, following the IRA Harrods bombing, the British government considered making Sinn F√©in a proscribed organisation again alongside the Ulster Defence Association unionist paramilitary group. This proposal had support from the Democratic Unionist Party who claimed Sinn F√©in were a front for terrorism and one newspaper called them \\"...the IRA in drag\\". A report by Sir George Baker argued against proscription of both groups however, he did make comments suggesting legislation against those using terrorism during elections.  Act  Baker's report was used as grounds for the creation of the Elected Authorities (Northern Ireland) Act 1989. The act required that in order for any candidate to stand for election in Northern Ireland, they were required to make a declaration against terrorism. The full declaration is: \\"I declare that, if elected, I will not by word or deed express support for or approval of (a) any organisation that is for the time a proscribed organisation specified in Schedule 2 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978: or (b) acts of terrorism (that is to say violence for political ends) connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland\\". The act also disqualified anyone who had been imprisoned for longer than three months from standing for elected office in Northern Ireland for five years.  Results  Though the act was primarily aimed at Sinn F√©in in lieu of outright proscription, Sinn F√©in candidates agreed to sign the declaration. Republican Sinn F√©in however called it a \\"test oath\\" and refused to sign it. As a result, their candidates were banned from taking part in the 1989 Northern Ireland local elections. They also attempted to run candidates in the 2011 Northern Ireland local elections but their nominations were rejected because they again refused to sign the declaration as required by the Act.

It is Carroll County's oldest developed park and hosts thousands of visitors annually. The park encompasses 550 acres of fields, forest and open spaces, features over 5 miles of hiking trails, a 300-acre lake and many sports and recreational facilities. Prior to being a park, this land was a private farm. The Piney Run project was initiated in 1964 to provide southeastern Carroll County with a future water supply, a site for outdoor recreation, and for protection from flooding. Construction of a 73 foot high earthen dam began in 1973 and was completed 16 months later. This created the 300 acre lake that is used for boating, fishing and wildlife conservation. A portion of the 500 acres surrounding the lake has been developed for recreational use. The remaining land is conserved in its natural state. The lake is 50 feet deep at the lowest part, just in front of the dam. Piney Run Park officially began operations in 1976. At this time, the only building in the park was the entrance station. The Park Manager had his office at that location and all Park business, including rental of boats, occurred there. Since 1976, many structures have been erected throughout the park, including the Nature Center and the boathouse. Semi-permanent structures have also been added, such as picnic tables, six pavilions, playgrounds, an amphitheater, and basketball and tennis courts. Additionally, a steel sculpture titled \\"The Great Blue Heron,\\" created by local Sykesville artist, Virginia Sperry, was installed in March 2018 off-shore near the boathouse. Piney Run Nature Center The Piney Run Nature Center is operated by the Carroll County Department of Parks and Recreation. The Nature Center was completed in 1981 and is staffed by the Park Naturalists and volunteers. It offers programs throughout the year to school, youth and community organizations. The Nature Center features living exhibits and informative displays pertaining to the history and ecosystem of Piney Run Park. The center also has designated rooms for young children and environmental education. Piney Run Nature Center staff offer environmental education, a part of the center's \\"mother nature program series,\\" and birthday parties, which are available to the public.

Flora Karimova joined the rally of defence of the rights of Azerbaijan which later turned a political campaign of National Independence Movement and became one of civil right activist and renounced public figure. She was entitled to Lady (Xanim) due to her gallantry, honesty and honorable public affairs. In 1988 her records began to be terminated and almost half of her archive was undermined by Soviet Authority to punish and deter her from her political movement. Nothing prevented her from her combat. Flora Karimova was first ever Azerbaijan modern woman social freedom and human rights activist. Her great valour was when Soviet Army attacked Azerbaijan killing millions of civilian in January 19 night. Next day Flora Karimova rebelled against Soviet Authority marching with women in streets among tanks. Whereupon one of tank near Philarmonic Hall drove toward flock of people.

During this horror period it can be estimated her more than two- thirds of her musical archive was wiped off. Flora Karimova did not stop her opposition movement for the sake of reforming democracy. Government slandered and abused her by blaming her in immortality and selling out the country. False accusation and conspiracy could not defame her greatness.

Set in 1949, the plot is a fictionalized account of the LAPD officers and detectives, called the 'Gangster Squad', who attempt to keep Los Angeles safe from Mickey Cohen and his gang. After the script spent several years on the Black List, production of the film began in September 2011 around Los Angeles, lasting through December. The film was originally set to be theatrically released September 7, 2012, but in the wake of the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting, the film was pushed back to a January 11, 2013 release date by Warner Bros. to accommodate re-shoots, which took place in August 2012. Gangster Squad received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and production values but criticized the thinly-written characters. The movie grossed $105 million worldwide. Plot In 1949 Los Angeles, Mafia boss Mickey Cohen has become the most powerful figure in the California criminal underworld and intends to expand his criminal enterprise to Chicago and New York City. The LAPD has not been able to stop Cohen's ruthless rise, as he has eliminated witnesses, hired dirty cops to protect his criminal activities, and shielded himself from prosecution through corruption in the justice system. Determined to put a stop to Cohen, LAPD Chief Bill Parker creates a secret police unit, composed of officers who do not carry badges and are authorized to act outside of the law, with the sole mission of bringing Cohen to justice. Parker puts a trusted friend, Sergeant John O'Mara, in charge of secretly building the unit. With the help of his wife, Connie, he recruits Sergeant Jerry Wooters and four incorruptible misfit officers ‚Äì black Lieutenant Coleman Harris, electronics expert and family man Conwell Keeler, sharpshooter Max Kennard, and his Hispanic prot√©g√© Navidad Ramirez. Calling themselves the \\"Gangster Squad\\", they begin the task of destroying Cohen's operations. The Squad's plans go well, striking several successful blows at the heart of Cohen's criminal organization, even shutting down his ultralucrative wire gambling business. Cohen, not knowing that the Squad is LAPD, believes someone has betrayed him to rivals and strikes out at those around him, including his etiquette tutor Grace Faraday. Wooters has been not only seeing Faraday, but also entering a romantic relationship with her, and tries to help her escape from Cohen, enlisting the help of mutual friend and gangster Jack Whalen to keep her safe. Realizing the attackers have never stolen his money, Cohen deduces they are cops and figures out that they have bugged his house. He uses it to lure the Squad into an unsuccessful ambush in Chinatown while Keeler is executed by a Cohen hitman while checking his tapes. When Faraday witnesses Cohen murder Whalen in cold blood, she agrees to testify against her former employer. O'Mara forces a crooked judge to do his duty and sign an arrest warrant before leading the Squad to the Park Plaza Hotel to arrest Cohen. Cohen and his men engage in a lengthy shootout with the Squad, with Wooters and Kennard being wounded in the process. Cohen and his bodyguard Karl Lennox escape, but O'Mara rams their vehicle into a fountain. Navidad helps a dying Kennard shoot Lennox, who was about to shoot O'Mara. Cohen and O'Mara fight each other in a brutal bareknuckle brawl while a crowd of onlookers and journalists gather. O'Mara finally beats Cohen and has him arrested, ending his spread of the mafia into the Los Angeles area. The Gangster Squad is never mentioned for its role, and its surviving members remain a secret. Cohen is sentenced to life imprisonment and is greeted with a beating by inmates who were friends of Whalen. Wooters and Faraday get married, and O'Mara quits his job with the LAPD to live a quiet life with his wife and son. Cast * Josh Brolin as Sergeant John O'Mara.

Sets were located all over L.A. County from north of the San Fernando Valley to south of the county border. Sets were also recreated in Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. Filming wrapped on December 15, 2011. Association with the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting The first trailer for Gangster Squad was released on , 2012. In the wake of the theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado on July 20, the trailer was pulled from running before films and airing on television, and removed from Apple's trailer site and YouTube due to a scene in which characters shoot submachine guns at moviegoers through the screen of Grauman's Chinese Theatre. It was later reported that the theater scene from the film would be either removed or placed in a different setting, since it is a crucial part of the film, and the film would undergo additional re-shoots of several scenes to accommodate these changes, which resulted in the release of Gangster Squad being moved back to a later date. About a week after the shootings in Aurora, Warner officially confirmed that the film would be released on January 11, 2013, bumped from the original September 7, 2012 release date. Just two weeks later, on August 22, the cast reunited in Los Angeles to completely re-shoot the main action sequence of the film. The new scene was placed in a version of Chinatown where the Gangster Squad comes into open conflict with the gangsters as they strike back at the Gangster Squad. Josh Brolin said he was not sad the original scene was cut and admitted that this new version is just as violent. Release The film was originally supposed to be theatrically released in the United States on September 7, 2012. However in the wake of the Aurora shooting and the need to accompany for reshoots, it was pushed back to January 11, 2013.  Home media  Gangster Squad was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 23, 2013. The Blu- ray includes director's commentary from Ruben Fleischer and several segments about the real life men and stories of the Gangster Squad and Mickey Cohen. As of June 2013, it had made $9.6 million from DVD sales and $6.7 million from Blu-ray, for a total of $16.3 million in sales.https://m.the- numbers.com/movie/Gangster-Squad-The Reception  Box office  Gangster Squad grossed $46 million in the United States and Canada, and $59.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $105.2 million, against a production budget of $60 million. The film grossed $17.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office behind Zero Dark Thirty and A Haunted House. It then made $8.6 million in its second weekend (including $10.1 million over the four-day MLK weekend) and $4.3 million in its third weekend. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 32% based on 203 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though it's stylish and features a talented cast, Gangster Squad suffers from lackluster writing, underdeveloped characters, and an excessive amount of violence.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. The reviewers of Spill.com gave it a \\"Rental,\\" praising the stylish approach but criticizing the dialogue, Emma Stone's under-developed \\"damsel-in-distress\\" character, and Sean Penn's laughable makeup. IGN editor Chris Tilly wrote \\"Gangster Squad looks great but frustrates because with the talent involved, it had the potential to be so much more\\" and rated the film 6.3/10. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, saying \\"Gangster Squad is a highly stylized, pulp- fiction period piece based on true events\\" and noted the strong performances. Writing in place of Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, Jeff Shannon gave the film 2 stars out of 4, saying that Fleischer, better known for his comedic work, was \\"out of his element, and barely suppressing his urge to spoof the genre\\". He further criticized the stock characters, and the generally uneven tone of the film, but praised the action highlights such as the car chase, and occasional flashes of brilliance in the performance of Sean Penn.  Historical accuracy  The film is inspired by the real-life Gangster Squad of the LAPD, although much of the film is fabricated. * The film portrays Cohen organizing the murder of his overseer Jack Dragna, whereas in reality Cohen and Dragna were equals and Dragna died of a heart attack in 1956. * William Parker was only 45 years old in 1949, and not in his 70s like Nick Nolte (Parker did not live to become 70; he died at age 61), and was not the one who created the Gangster Squad. The Squad was created by Chief Clemence B. Horrall in 1946, and was in an effort to save the image of the city, not the actual city itself. * The film concludes with Cohen being arrested in 1949 for murder and sent to Alcatraz. In reality, he was imprisoned in 1951 and again in 1961 for tax evasion. He was, however, attacked with a lead pipe while in prison as mentioned. * While Anthony Mackie and Michael Pe√±a are members of the Squad in the film, the real life group had no African-American or Hispanics as part of it. * While it is possible Cohen murdered Jack Whalen in real life, it was not at Whalen's home as depicted in the film. Whalen was shot in 1959 while at dinner with Cohen and three of his associates, although Cohen was not accused or convicted of the murder himself. * Cohen's bodyguard Johnny Stompanato was not shot like depicted in the film, but instead lived until 1958, when he was stabbed by Cheryl Crane, the daughter of his girlfriend, Lana Turner. * The character Max Kennard was based on real life lawman Doug (Jumbo) Kennard, who was killed in a 1952 drunk car crash after he had retired, and not shot in the line of duty like in the film. * In the film, Conwell Keeler is the first member of the Squad to be killed. In real life, he outlived all other members of the Gangster Squad, dying of a stroke in 2012.

It might be outdated. The Mediterranean Bauxite Province is a major region of high- quality bauxite ores that stretches for 3,000 km along the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea from Spain to Turkey, encompassing parts of southern France, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The province covers an area of about 2 million km2. Extent and Age The Mediterranean bauxite region, part of the Alpide geosynclinal belt of bauxite formation, includes geosynclinal depressions and the peripheral parts of platforms and median masses. The bauxites date from the Middle Triassic to the Neogene, although most of the deposits were formed during the Cretaceous. Deposits The largest bauxite deposits are located in Greece (Parnassus-Giona region), Yugoslavia (Niksic, Vlasenica, Obrovac, Drni√°, Mostar), Hungary (G√°nt, Halimba, Iszkaszentgy√∂rgy, Nyir√°d, Harsan), and France (Brignoles and elsewhere). The first bauxite ore was discovered in 1821 around Les Baux in southern France, from which the ore received its name. The major deposits were found in the 19th century. Types of deposits Bauxites of the Mediterranean province generally overlie the karstic surfaces of limestones or dolomites. The deposits form pockets, lenses, chains of pockets or lenses, and sometimes extended sheets. The bauxite sheets tend to slope, either gently or steeply; only on the Hungarian Massif do the sheets lie almost horizontally. The sheets that are currently being mined range in thickness from 1 m to 8 m. Chemical composition The ores have a chemical composition of 45‚Äì55 percent Al2O3, 2‚Äì10 percent SiO2, 15‚Äì23 percent Fe2O3, and 2‚Äì3 percent TiO2. Losses during calcination range from 12 to 20 percent. Gibbsite-boehmite ores predominate, although diaspore and gibbsite are also encountered. The ores are derived from deposits of the geosynclinal or Mediterranean type. Most scientists regard the bauxites of the Mediterranean province as talus and proluvial deposits having formed from the products of the erosion of the lateritic and subsequently having undergone the process of bauxitization. Output volume The annual output of bauxite in the Mediterranean province increased from 6 million to 10 million tons a year between 1961 and 1972. The most economically important deposits are in southern France and Yugoslavia. References * Bushinskii, G. I. Geologiia boksitov, 2nd ed.

Vallman studied at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm and developed a colourful naivist style of painting under the influence of Isaac Gr√ºnewald and Sven Erixson. His breakthrough came with the Ung konst (\\"Young art\\") exhibition in Stockholm in 1947. He later learned to know the Danish artist Asger Jorn, whose influence made Vallman develop a more abstract style. Uno Vallman was one of the original members of the avantgarde movement called COBRAhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBRA_(avant-garde_movement) which included artists like Karel Appel and Corneille. He was introduced to this group of artists by one of his friends and co-founder of the CoBra Art movement Asger Jorn from Denmark (1914-1973). Uno Vallman travelled a lot for studies to for example Italy, Spain, North Africa, China, Rumania, Mexico, Russia and the USA. Uno Vallman lived in Paris for several years from 1940‚Äì1960. During these years he got acquainted with none other than Marc Chagall. Marc Chagall on his behalf was in contact with the artist Miro. He learned a lot of them. Chagall and Vallman had an exhibition in 1952 in the USAhttp://www.vallman.se/biografi.htm Vallman became known as one of the 'Men of 1947' and was one of a group of artists responsible for moving art forwards into a modern age in Scandinavia. The 'Men of 1947' was a group of artists who had an exhibition together during 1947https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_√•rs_m√§n> During the 1960s Vallman was described as the \\"Picasso of the North\\" by French art critics.https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Vallman Uno Valmann's art was not only art but was considered a way of living called 'Valmanismen'. Uno Vallman's works are included in the Swedish National Museum, The Swedish Modern Museum and some other museums. His works are also included in the collections of Lyndon Johnson, Jimmy Carter and the Tessin Institute in Paris. He also wrote a book called 'Som lamans utsende I Tibet' (1980) and illustrated a book called 'Kanaljen is seraljen' by the author Lennart Hellsings. During the 1980s he was mentioned in the media for owning a statue by Paul Gauguin which he sold at auction (Christies New York). After he died his dotter found out the money of the sale had been deposited at a bank account in Luxembourg at Banque Invik. She could see that although the money had been deposited and was never withdrawn, the money appeared to have disappeared. She wrote to the bank without an answer and even threatened the banque with a lawyer called Lennart Lindstrom from the Law firm Grunberger. Uno Vallman had apparently opened the bank account together with another man and signed what is called a \\"Hold Mail\\" agreement. A Hold Mail agreement means that the bank is not allowed to send information about communication, available assets and/or transactions. The claim she made was around 8 million Swedish Crowns (around 800.000,00 US dollars) which was around the amount the statue sold for, while all possessions on paper showed a value of 10.000,00 Swedish Crowns (around 1.000,00 US dollars).https://www.realtid.se/konstnarsdotter-kraver-banque-invik-pa- miljonbelopp Uno Vallman also played an interesting role in a story about a painting that he bought at a gallery which was later authenticated to be by the painter Emile Henry Bernard (a friend of Van Gogh, C√©zanne and Gaugain.https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/8623527-181/mystery-masterpieces- journey-involved-healdsburghttp://www.conversations.org/story.php?sid=585 References *Konstn√§ren Uno Vallman d√∂d Category:1913 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century Swedish painters Category:Swedish male painters Category:21st-century Swedish painters Category:Avant-garde art Category:Royal Institute of Art alumni Category:People from S√∂derhamn Municipality ","title":"Uno Vallman"},{"id":"32439226","text":"Parappanad was a former Hindu feudal city state in Malabar, India.Logan, William (2006).

By June and July of that same year, 7,682 young athletes between the ages of 16 and 21 attended tryout camps which were arranged in 41 states. Of the 42 who were accepted for the first class, none were scouted by any of the major league ballclubs and eight had never played the sport at the high-school level.

Kauffman recommended that the courses taken involved business and public relations out of concern for the players' financial well-being in the future. Expenses for books and room and board was paid by the Royals.

His art is typically created through a series of self- imposed constraints also sometimes referred to as visual algorithms ‚Äîrules Siena decides on before sitting down to work. In most of his work he establishes a basic unit and action and repeats it indefinitely.http://www.moma.org/learn/kids_families/artist_talks#course-631337428 Siena commented that, \\"at a certain point I wanted to make drawings and works that act as machines. The way they act as machines is you have to find your way into them and find your way out of them. As you undo the making of them they come to life.\\"http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/248/1711 While originally recognized for his paintings using enamel paints on aluminum plates, Siena has also become recognized for his drawings, prints, typed works on paper using vintage typewriters, and sculpture. Sculptures have ranged from made with his own hands using common materials such as: toothpicks, bamboo skewers bound with string, and grape vines to his larger sculptures that have been realized in bronze and wood in partnership with the Walla Walla Foundry.https://www.pacegallery.com/exhibitions/12731/new-sculpture  Early Years and Influences  James Siena was born in Oceanside, California in 1957 James Siena Selected One-Artist Exhibitions Pace Gallery, New York. but lived and grew up in Washington D.C. until the age of 12, when his family moved to California in 1969. He moved to New York in 1975 to attend Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He received his Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) in 1979 from Cornell. Asked to name the teacher who most influenced him, Siena quickly cites Mary Croston, an after-school art instructor who taught him as a teenager. Croston treated her young students as ‚Äúreal‚Äù artists, says Siena, introducing them to such tools as charcoal and graphite and coaching them in figure drawing. ‚ÄúShe just taught the basics; that was very influential,‚Äù he says of those classes in the ‚Äúart hut‚Äù behind Croston's house in Stanford, California. Siena also remembers being ‚Äúvery moved‚Äù by the late Peter Kahn, who taught the history of techniques at Cornell. According to Siena, ‚ÄúHe was a marvelous Renaissance man‚Äù who taught his students such skills as determining whether paper is archival quality and making ink out of toast crumbs and saliva. When Siena opted to move to New York rather than attend graduate school after finishing his B.F.A. at Cornell University, he found plenty of mentors in the local art community. He was impressed by the ‚Äúvery independent, visionary spirit‚Äù of Alan Saret, who took him to the scrap yard and taught him about working with metal. Chuck Close helped him understand ‚Äúvery obvious stuff‚Äù like how to approach a relationship with a gallery (Close likened it to a ‚Äúconversation‚Äù) and how to maximize earnings from day jobs to spend more time painting. Before being able to become an artist full-time Siena supported himself as a frame maker.http://www.edwardwinkleman.com/2005/12/artist-of- week-121905.html Prior to becoming an established and recognized visual artist, James Siena was known for his performance art, which included singing and rapping with his now ex-wife Iris Rosehttp://www.brooklynrail.org/2005/11/art/james-siena-with-chris-martin and Chazz Dean. Most notably he appeared on Cinemax's TV series Dangerous Film Club during the 1987 season of the show.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335646/  Rise to Notoriety  Siena started making abstract paintings with an aesthetic that sought inspiration from Artificial Intelligence (AI). For years he has been investigating the imaginary space of programmers' source and patterns through paint. At first glance the images could be labeled as decorative puzzles or labyrinths but there is a logic base for each painting. Siena's first major solo show was held at the Brooklyn, NY gallery, Pierogi 2000 in 1996. His first solo museum exhibition took place in 2003 at the San Francisco Art Institute Gallery. Since then he's had numerous solo shows including at Gorney Bravin + Lee in New York, Daniel Weinberg Gallery in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and The Pace Gallery in New York. His work has been featured in over 50 group exhibitions, including most notably the Whitney Museum of American Art's 2004 Whitney Biennial. Siena has had work either reviewed or published in the following publications: Art in America, The New York Times, The New Yorker, ARTnews, The Art Newspaper, The Village Voice, New York Sun, San Francisco Chronicle and Art on Paper. In Patricia Phillips, chair of the Department of Art, Cornell University; letter of Siena's nomination for the 2009-10 Eissner Artist of the Year Award, she wrote: > \\"James Siena is one of the most inventive, independent, focused and prolific > artists working today. ‚Ä¶ Thirty years after he received his B.F.A. from > Cornell, Siena has emerged as one of the art world's internationally > respected leaders. ‚Ä¶ [He] balances the traditions of 20th‚Äì21st century > abstraction with a maverick sensibility to craft salient, if speculative, > insights on the contemporary world, and the intricate workings of human > perception.\\"http://aap.cornell.edu/art/alumni/news/newsitem.cfm?customel_datapageid_2892=180286 Siena has also played muse for other artists including being a subject for paintings and sculpture by Joe Fighttp://www.carrollandsons.net/artists/fig.php and multiple works of art by Chuck Close. Siena also appeared on camera in the 2008 documentary film, Herb and Dorothy by Megumi Sasaki. The film is about the long-time New York contemporary art collector couple, Herbert and Dorothy Vogel. Rare among contemporary artists, Siena uses no assistants in the creation of his paintings and drawings. In 2017, the James Siena Catalogue Raisonn√©,https://artifexpress.com/catalogues/james-siena/description was published as a digital catalogue raisonn√© by Artifex Press, New York. The first volume includes Siena's complete paintings, sculptures, and gouaches from 1989 to the present and a large selection of early works.

In particular, Harlan & Weaver have published several individual prints and two portfolios of nine prints with Siena. The close proximity of their studios has helped to foster an enduring working relationship.http://www.harlanandweaver.com/bio.htm#section_12 Prints by James Siena have been featured in five New Print Shows by the International Print Center New York (IPCNY) since 2000. Siena was invited to ULAE by Larissa Goldston in the summer of 2003. Although he had been making prints for years, he came to ULAE specifically to explore stone lithography.http://ulae.com/jamessiena/index.aspx Printmakers and print programs who have collaborated with James Siena on prints include: * Center for Contemporary Printmaking (2009 Mystery Artist) * Dieu Donn√© Papermill * Flying Horse Editions (University of Central Florida) * Harlan & Weaver * Island Press (Washington University in St. Louis) * Lincoln Center Vera List Art Project (2006) * Lower East Side Printshop * Neptune Fine Art/Brand X Projects * Pace Prints * Pol√≠grafa Obra Gr√°fica * Shore Publishing * Tamarind Institute (University of New Mexico) * Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE) * The University of the Arts MFA Book Arts + Printmaking * Wassaic Project To view images and details of most of the prints made by the artist to date, visit Troy McHenry's James Siena Prints Catalog.  Other Projects   Books  James Siena has contributed illustrations or accompanying prints for several books. The first, a collection of poems by Geoffrey Young, first published in 1996, \\"Pockets of Wheat\\" contains camera reduction images of James Siena's intricate 60\\" X 40\\" black-and-white ink drawings, including the cover illustration. In 2003, Siena also contributed artwork to another book of poems by Geoffrey Young, entitled \\"Lights Out\\", published by the small press, The Figures.http://www.geoffreyyoung.com/thefigures/lightsout.html Printed in 2005 was a limited edition of 200 copies of \\"Spring\\" (an excerpt from a larger work entitled, \\"The Weather\\") by Kenneth Goldsmith. Siena contributed five 2-color wood engravings with each book. Each book is signed by the author, Kenneth Goldsmith and Siena. Edition was published by Didymous Press, a moniker used by INC, inc.http://www.inkinc-us.com for their self-published works. Another book project, published in 2009 by Granary Books, is a limited edition of 50 copies titled, \\"Oaths? Questions?\\" in partnership with Marjorie Welish.http://granarybooks.com/book/1130/James_Siena_Marjorie_Welish+Oaths_Questions/ This book of poetry by Welish is really a collaboration with Siena's artwork and the words, printed on transparent pages plays off of the artwork. James Siena commented about the book: > \\"To summarize an Artist‚Äôs Book in a statement raises questions as to its > very utility. But there were needs to be met in my first collaboration with > Marjorie Welish, and they can be verbalized. So: no summary, just a run-down > of issues and urges. Among them was the urgent desire to make something > quite unlike a print, painting, or drawing. To make a Book in all its > Bookness, sequential, teleological, inevitable. As well as strange, of > course. To tell the story of a making of something, to undo it, page by > page. So this book takes us apart and puts us back together again, none the > worse for wear, but certainly not the same as before. And the words offer > hints to the truth (oaths) and doubts about them as well (questions). Their > very transparency evidences the debt they owe to the wordless visual.\\" - > James Siena Also in 2009 Siena created \\"Sequence\\", published and printed by Flying Horse Editions, a hand-printed, double-sided accordion book that stretches seventeen-feet long. The double-sided book follows a linear, geometric pattern as it coalesces and unwinds through thirty-six pages, black intertwining with red, and in reverse. The abstraction climaxes on two final frames (back and front), where the sequence reaches its full realization and the rule is maximized, having gone through seventeen 'moves.'  Design  The Yaddo Artist Medal, established in 2014, was designed by James Siena and produced by Walla Walla Foundry in Walla Walla, Washington. The process began by creating a 3D model based on designs submitted by Siena. A combination of machining, etching, and hand finishing was used to fabricate the medal to achieve the highest possible level of detail in the finished piece. The inaugural winner, was the author, Philip Roth.http://yaddo.org/yaddo/news.shtml?story_id=%7B5EB795E3-ABCD-4AA6-BACA- EEB86BE7CBF4%7D Siena is a known wine enthusiast and helped design the wine label and logo for the Oregon-based winery, Illahe Vineyards in 2011. As per the winery's website: > \\"Our label was designed by artist James Siena and letterpress artist Ruth > Lingen who worked together to create a classic look with American fonts from > the early 1900s... All thanks to our friend Dan Schmidt, also a New York > artist, a few bottles of the earliest Illahe products showed up at James‚Äôs > studio lunch table on Canal Street. Now, James is a huge fan of Burgundy and > Bordeaux, but it was the viognier that he enjoyed so much that he offered to > design a label for us. He worked with Ruth Lingen at Pace Prints (Pace > Gallery represents James), and they came up with a label, now our reserve > label, that incorporates letterpress fonts from the 19th century and a > ‚Äònecker‚Äô with the vintage... Best of all, James redesigned our logo based on > the word Illahe from the Duployan script that Merry Young found for the > winery.\\"  Rugs  The art gallery BravinLee has also issued two series of hand- knotted wool rugs based on James Siena designs. The rugs are similar to artworks in that they are made in limited numbered quantities along with artists proofs and each is signed by the artist. The two designs are entitled Global Key, 2009 (Edition of 15 + 2 APs) and Nine Constant Windows, Second Version, 2009 (Edition of 18 + 2 APs).  Gallery  James Siena also runs a small project gallery called: Sometimes (Works of Art) located on Canal Street. When asked when and why he decided to open an art gallery, Siena responded, \\"It was in the fall of 2009, as the art world was at its nadir; galleries were closing, artists weren't selling, pessimism abounded. I decided the time was ripe for and artist-driven response to all this, and to make something happen outside the gallery system. Shows would be longer; there would be music or performances at the openings; events during the run of the show would be encouraged (readings, music, discussion), and the artist, if possible, would sit the gallery on the one day per week it would be open. That way, viewers would meet the person who made the work, thus encouraging a new kind of interaction.\\"http://www.twocoatsofpaint.com/2012/10/peter-scotts-two- part-disappearance-and.html Artists whose work has been shown at the gallery include, David Brody, Tim Maul, Aura Rosenberg, Dan Schmidt, Peter Scott, and Fred Valentine. As Time Out New York magazine comments, \\"This tiny, artist-run space has no website but showcases venerable artists established on the New York scene. One example of the proprietor's collection of antique typewriters is on view at all times in the gallery.\\"http://newyork.timeout.com/arts- culture/art/400641/sometimes-works-of-art  Theatre  In 1989 Siena partnered with Conrad Cummings in writing Photo Op, a 60min long contemporary opera. Siena wrote the words (libretto) and Cummings the music. In 2012, UrbanArias, a local Washington DC-based company that specializes in small- scale, contemporary, and experimental operas staged a production of Photo Op. UrbanArias‚Äô producer/conductor Robert Wood notes that, although Siena and Cummings wrote Photo Op in 1989, ‚Äúthe immediacy of this opera 20 years later is uncanny.‚Äù That's because it's so clich√©d. Maybe we should blame the politicians more than the librettist; they are, after all, the ones who keep getting caught in their zippers.http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/artsdesk/music/2012/09/12/urbanarias- photo-op-reviewed/  Works in Museums & Institutions  Works by James Siena are part of the permanent collection of the following museums/institutions: * Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick, Me. * Colby College Museum of Art, Waterville, Me. * Daum Museum of Contemporary Art, Sedalia, Mo. * Des Moines Art Center * Hammer Museum at UCLA, Los Angeles * Herbert F.

Personal life  James Siena is married to artist Katia Santiba√±ez.http://www.edwardwinkleman.com/2005/12/artist-of-week-121905.html They were featured jointly in the Ferrin Gallery's group show, COUPLEShttp://www.ferringallery.com/dynamic/exhibit_artist2.asp?ExhibitID=382 from 2010.

Siena is also known for his affinity towards, knowledge and collection of vintage typewriters and has commented that he owns over 100 typewriters and enjoys the sometimes novel approaches earlier manufacturers took in solving problems or creating enhancements to their typewriters.\\"Courier\\".

Bujantai was descended from Nacibulu (Á¥çÂ•áÂçúÁ•ø), the ancestor of the Nara lineages of Ula and Hada. Tradition spoke of Nacibulu as having attracted the attention of some Mongols who desired to make him subservient to them. When the Mongols attempted to capture him, however, he successfully subdued them, and when they shouted to inquire his name he responded with a defiant challenge, \\"Nara\\". In this manner the important Nara clan is supposed to have received its name. Nacibulu settled near modern Jilin on the Sungari river, which was often called simply the Ula, or \\"the river\\". There he became a successful hunter and trapper who attracted many followers. Several generations later, two brothers among his descendants, Kesina (ÂÖã‰ªÄÁ¥ç) and Gudui Juyan (Âè§Â∞çÁè†Âª∂), became the ancestors of the Hada and Ula branches of the Nara clan. Buyan (Â∏ÉÂª∂), grandson of Gudui juyan, fortified the settlement on the Sungari and named himself beile of the Ula tribe. Two of his grandsons were Mantai (ÊªøÊ≥∞) and Bujantai, both of whom would succeed to the position of beile of the Ula. The Yehe tribe under the beile Bujai (Â∏ÉÈΩã,Â∏ÉÊàí) and Narimbulu assembled the various groups in the H≈´lun alliance, along with some Khorchin Mongols, to oppose the rising power of Nurhaci. Bujantai led the Ula contingent, but was taken prisoner by Nurhaci when the confederation was defeated at Mt. Gure in October 1593. Nurhaci refrained from killing Bujantai and after holding him for three years as a retainer sent him back under escort to the Ula. The Ula beile Mantai, and his son having recently been executed by their tribesmen, Bujantai was released by Nurhaci, established as beile in his brother's place and as tributary to the lord of the Jianzhou, Nurhaci. In order to cement ties with Nurhaci, he sent a sister as wife to Nurhaci's brother, ≈†urhaci, and in 1597 joined the Yehe and other tribes in a formal truce with Nurhaci. Two years Bujantai would received a daughter of ≈†urhaci as a wife, and in 1601 he arranged the marriage of his niece, the future Empress Xiao Lie Wu to Nurhaci. Two years later after unsuccessful attempts to secure a daughter of the Mongol, Minggan ÊòéÂÆâ, chief of the Borjigit tribe, he requested another wife from Nurhaci and was given a second daughter of ≈†urhaci. Even though these matrimonial ties existed between the Ula and Nurhaci, a war broke out in 1607 between Nurhaci and the Ula in which the latter were defeated with the loss of some towns. Bujantai then promised Nurhaci that if he was given another wife then a truce would be called for. Nurhaci then sent one of his own daughters to him and this would secured a peace between the two for four years. In 1612 Bujantai tried to bribe the Yehe beile, Bujai, into giving him for a wife a daughter who had been promised to Nurhaci. He also subjected Nurhaci's daughter whom he had married to indignity by \\"shooting whistling arrows at her\\". Enraged by these acts, Nurhaci took personal command of an expedition which completely defeated the Ula tribe in 1613. Bujantai fled to the Yehe under the beile Gintaisi who gave him refuge. He died before the Yehe tribe also fell into Nurhaci's hands. References * Kennedy, George A. \\"Bujantai.\\" edited by Hummel, Arthur W. (1943). Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period.

The ruling King was called Ali Raja (\\"the Sea Ruler\\") and the ruling queen was called Arakkal Beevi.Logan, William (2006). Malabar Manual, Mathrubhumi Books, Calicut. Arakkal kingdom included little more than the Cannanore town and the southern Laccadive Islands (Agatti, Kavaratti, Androth and Kalpeni, as well as Minicoy), originally leased from the Kolattiri. The royal family is said to be originally a branch of the Kolattiri, descended from a princess of that family who converted to Islam. They owed allegiance to the Kolattiri rulers, whose ministers they had been at one time. The rulers followed the Marumakkathayam system of matrilineal inheritance, a system which is unique to a section of Hindus of Kerala. Under Marumakkathayam, the succession passes to the male offspring of its female members, in other words from a man to his sister's son and so forth. As the only Muslim rulers in Malabar, they saw the rise of Hyder Ali as the opportunity to increase their own power at the expense of Chirakkal, and invited him to invade Malabar. Ali Raja Kunhi Amsa II and his successor, Arakkal Bibi Junumabe II, were among Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan's staunchest allies during the Mysorean occupation of malabar. Afsal Ashraf (Arakkal Sultan) is a living descendant of the Arakkal dynasty at Konni in Pathanamthitta district. The Bibi received no special treatment after the treaties of Srirangapatam, and settlement negotiations were long and difficult but she finally signed an agreement in 1796 that guaranteed continued possession of the city of Cannanore and the Laccadive Islands, but deprived her of any claim to sovereignty. Yet, as late as 1864, the Bibi of Cannanore was included in an official list of \\"native sovereigns and chiefs\\" as being entitled to a seven-gun salute, the only Malabar prince so listed. Because of the outbreak of the war with France shortly after the 1796 agreement, as well as other considerations, the Laccadive Islands remained unnoticed and the Bibi continued to rule them with no restrictions. The islands were misgoverned throughout the 19th century, and the British Government had to assume their administration at least twice, in 1854-1861, and again (permanently as it turned out) in 1875. In 1905, in exchange for the remission of overdue tribute, the payment of an annual pension to the head of the family, and the title of Sultan, the Ali Raja at last agreed to cede all rights, whether as sovereign or tenant, to the Laccadive Islands, including Minicoy, which the family claimed as their private property. The king's palace, which he purchased from the Dutch in 1663, was named Arakkal Palace after the ruling dynasty. Origins Mappila Bay with the old Arakkal kingdom in the distance As per myth, the last ruler of the Chera Empire, Rama Varma Kulashekhara Perumal, is claimed to have been converted to Islam by Malik Bin Dinar,Malabar Manual, Volume 1, William Logan an Islamic missionary. Perumal along with Malik Deenar came from Mahodyapuram (Old name of Kodungallur -The capital of the Chera Empire) to Thalassery, to visit Perumal's sister and nephew residing there. Perumal's sister Sridevi and nephew Mabeli were residing in a place called Dharmadam north of Thalassery. The relics of their fort is located in the vicinity of Govt. Brennan College, Thalassery. Mabeli was converted to Islam and he accepted the name Muhammed Ali, who later became the first Arakkal Ali Raja.Kerala Muslim History ‚Äì P A Syed Mohammed According to folklore, Cheraman Perumal went to Mecca from an erstwhile province named Poya Nadu(Governed by feudal governors named Randuthara Achanmar. The region comprices Edakkad, Anjarakkandy, Mavilayi etc.) now in Kannur district. Malik Deenar built a mosque in Madayi north of Kannur, the third oldest mosque in Kerala. Perumal's nephew Mabeli was an Arayankulangara Nair, and hence the Nair matrilineal system is observed by the Arakkal royal family.Kerala District Gazetteers: Malappuram, A. Sreedhara Menon, Superintendent of Govt. Presses, 1972, p. 92 His wife was the daughter of Kolathiri, and they later came to be known as Arakkal Beevi. Muhammad Ali continued in the service of the Kolathiris even after his conversion, and his successors known as the Mammali Kidavus were the hereditary Padanairs of the Kolathiri. Around this time, many Muslim merchant families became financially influential in the Malabar region. When the Arakkal family took control of Laccadives, they achieved near-royal status. The British Military was very eager to make Dharmadam as their base and built a fort there. This small island village was strategically more secure than any surrounding places as it is a hilly island, however it was governed by Arakkal kingdom, being the first Ali Raja's home town. Arakkal kingdom was so powerful in that time as an ally of Sultanate of Mysore, even to defy the British. British East India Company was not allowed by the Arakkal kingdom to build military garrison in Dharmadam. So they were forced to build their base in Thalassery where there was strong presence of French forces stationed few kilometers away in Mahe. Another legend is that the daughter of Chirakkal Raja began to drown while bathing in the Chirakkal kulam (pond). Her friends cried and shouted but were unable to rescue her. Muhammed Ali heard the shouting and came to find out what was wrong. He recognized the girl drowning in the pond as the princess, but was hesitant about saving her because of untouchability and if a lower-caste person touched an upper-caste person it was considered a sin, possibly punishable by death. However, he rescued her and gave her his dhoti to cover the princess. When the news reached the Chirakkal Raja, he called his daughter and the Muhammed Ali. At that time, if a man gave a pudava (a long cloth used for covering the body) to an unmarried woman, they were considered married. The scholars of the court told the Raja that since his daughter was touched by a Muslim, she was no longer allowed to enter the palace. However, the man had given her his pudava so she was married to him as well. As per the custom the Raja had no other choice but to give his daughter to the Muhammed Ali. The Raja was unhappy to give his daughter his servant, so he made the boy ruler of a part of his dominion. The area given to the boy was known as Arakkal and his family was called the Arakkal family. Location The palace is three kilometers from Kannur, Kerala, India, in what is now called Kannur town. The Arakkal family was the only Muslim royal family of Kerala to control parts of the coast and Lakshadweep. Ali Rajas and Arakkal Beevis Ruler Sultana Aysha Arakkal Beevi. The Arakkal family followed a matriarchal system of descent: the eldest member of the family, whether male or female, became its head and ruler. While male rulers were called Ali Rajah, female rulers were known as Arakkal Beevis. Sultana Aysha Aliraja was the ruler until her death on the morning of 27 September 2006. Octogenarian Adiraja Mariyumma, alias Cheriya Bikkunhu Beevi, becomes the new head of the Arakkal family on 4 May 2019. History Muslims of Kerala believe their origins can be traced back to the 7th century CE when the religion originated in Arabia. The history of Muslims in Kerala is closely intertwined with the history of Muslims in the nearby Laccadives islands. Kerala's only Muslim kingdom was Kannur's Arakkal family. Historians however, disagree about the time period of Arakkal rulers. They see the Arakkal kings come to power in the 16th or 17th century. By 1909, Arakkal rulers had lost Kannur and the Cannanore Cantonment. By 1911, there was a further decline with the loss of chenkol (sceptre) and udaval (sword). They allied and clashed with the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French and the British. The British played the biggest part in removing all vestiges of titles and power from the Arakkal rulers. One of the last kings, Abdu Rahiman Ali Raja (1881‚Äì1946), was active in helping his subjects. The last ruler was Ali Raja Mariumma Beevi Thangal. After her rule, the family broke up. During the time of the Samuthiries the Muslims of Malabar played a major role in the local army and navy, as well as acting as ambassadors to Arabia and China. They forged alliances with the Moslil rulers of Gujarat and Bijapur. Even before this period they had settlements in Perumathura, Thakkala, Thengapattanam, Poovar and Thiruvankottu in southern Travancore Muslims from Pandi Desham migrated to trade with Erattupetta, Kanjirappalli, Mundakayam, Peruvanthanam, Muvattupuzha and Vandiperiyar in and around Kottayam district of Kerala. In the 17th century, trade links were established with places like Kayamkulam and Alappuzha in the west. It was during the time of Samuthiris that the title of Marakkar was created. Muslim influence reached its peak at the time of Kunjali Marakkar, the fourth in the line. After Kunjali Marakkar and Samuthiri parted company, Muslim influence declined. Relations with the Mughal Empire Ali Raja Ali II is known to have deployed his naval Mappila forces on behalf of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb during the Child's War. Relations with the Sultanate of Mysore During the time of Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan there was a revival amongst the Muslims of Malabar. When Hyder Ali overthrew Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Ali Raja Kunhi Amsa II declared that \\"God is powerful, and his fruits shall ripen\\", he immediately entered the service of Hyder Ali. Samathuri followed up with his own treaty with Hyder Ali. After being appointed the Naval Chief of Hyder Ali's army, Ali Raja Kunhi Amsa II's first course of action was to capture the unfortunate Sultan of the Maldives Hasan 'Izz ud-din and present him to Hyder Ali after having gouged out his eyes, he had also defeated Sultan Muhammad Imaduddin III of the Maldives, who died in captivity. Foreign relations of the Arakkal In the year 1777 a letter was sent to the Ottomans by Ali Raja Kunhi Amsa II, a dedicated ally of Hyder Ali of the Sultanate of Mysore and mentioned how the region received Ottoman assistance two hundred and forty years ago by Hadim Suleiman Pasha. Ali Raja Kunhi Amsa II also stated that the dynasty had been fighting for its authority for the last forty years against various hostile forces and also requested assistance against the British East India Company, two years later in 1780 another letter was sent by his sister Ali Raja Bibi Junumabe II requesting urgent assistance against Portuguese and British encroachments during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Arakkal Museum Arakkal Museum The Durbar Hall section of the Arakkalkettu (Arakkal Palace) has been converted into a museum housing artifacts from the times of the Arakkal dynasty. The work was carried out by the Government of Kerala at a cost of Rs. 9,000,000. The museum opened in July 2005. The Arakkalkettu is owned by the Arakkal Trust, which includes the some members Arakkal royal family. The government had taken a keen interest in preserving the heritage of the Arakkal Family, which had played a prominent role in the history of Malabar.

In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin is a 2011 non-fiction book by Erik Larson. Summary Larson recounts the career of the American Ambassador to Germany, William Dodd, particularly the years 1933 to 1937 when he and his family, including his daughter Martha, lived in Berlin. The Ambassador, who earned his Ph.D. in Leipzig 40 years earlier; and, at the time of his appointment, was head of the History Department at the University of Chicago initially hoped that Germany's new Nazi government would grow more moderate, including in its persecution of the Jews.Erik Larson, In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin, Crown Publishers, , 43, 66, 79-80 Martha, separated from her husband and in the process of divorce, became caught up in the glamor and excitement of Berlin's social scene and had a series of liaisons, most of them sexual, including among them Gestapo head Rudolf Diels and Soviet attach√© and secret agent Boris Vinogradov. She defended the regime to her skeptical friends. Within months of their arrival, the family became aware of the evils of Nazi rule. Dodd periodically protested against it. President Roosevelt was pleased with Dodd's performance while most State Department officials, suspicious of his lack of background in their area of expertise, as well as his inability to finance embassy activities from his own wealth, found him undiplomatic and idiosyncratic. The title of the work is a loose translation of Tiergarten, a zoo and park in the center of Berlin.

A moral clause within contracts used as a means of holding the individual or party(s) to a certain behavioral standard so as not to bring disrepute, contempt or scandal to other individual or party to the contract and their interests. It attempts to preserve a public and private image of such a party to the contract. In essence, one party to the contract is purchasing the other party's good name or reputation. These clauses are most seen in contracts between actors and actresses and their studios, the field of education (especially minors), athletes and their organization or proprietors of a product that the athlete(s) may endorse or as a part of a marital settlement. Commonly proscribed activity include the use or abuse of alcohol, the use of illegal drugs or narcotics or illegal or illicit sexual activity. Background The impetus for a morals clause in contracts for 'talent,' i.e., artistic performers appears to have been a reaction to the Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle case in 1921. Subsequent to media outcry, Universal Studios decided to add a morals clause to contracts. The text of the 1921 Universal Studios clause read as follows: \\"The actor (actress) agrees to conduct himself (herself) with due regard to public conventions and morals and agrees that he (she) will not do or commit anything tending to degrade him (her) in society or bring him (her) into public hatred, contempt, scorn or ridicule, or tending to shock, insult or offend the community or outrage public morals or decency, or tending to the prejudice of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company or the motion picture industry. In the event that the actor (actress) violates any term or provision of this paragraph, then the Universal Film Manufacturing Company has the right to cancel and annul this contract by giving five (5) days' notice to the actor (actress) of its intention to do so.\\" The first morals clause for a professional athlete may be a November 11, 1922 contract addendum for Babe Ruth. The clause stated: Apparently, Colonel Jake Ruppert (owner of the Yankees) had also hoped to curtail the Babe's notorious womanizing. Ruth is quoted as replying, \\"I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for you, fifty thousand dollars, or two- hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women. They're too much fun.\\" 21st century use morals clauses still exist widely for athletes, and in fact, may be invoked more quickly than in the past, as in the case of Ryan Lochte.

As a young adult, he worked for his uncle in Pittsburgh before moving to St. Louis and working as a clerk for the fur company, Gannt and Blackwell. In 1831 he went with Gannt and Blackwell's company of about 70 men on a trapping and trading expedition. Living off the land (Leonard reported that \\"The flesh of the Buffaloe is the wholesomest and most palatable of meat kind\\"), Leonard and his associates endured great privation while amassing a fortune in furs; the horses died in the harsh winter and the party was at times near starvation. They survived, in part, by trading with Native Americans. Among the more helpful tribal members he reported encountering was a negro who claimed to have been on Lewis & Clark's expedition, and who may have been the explorer- slave York. In 1835 Leonard returned to Independence, Missouri with enough wealth in furs to establish a store and trading post at Fort Osage. He continued to trade along the river for the rest of his life. Leonard's journal was published in book form by D.W. Moore of Clearfield, Pennsylvania in 1839, after being serialized in the Clearfield Republican.

He was the younger brother of Narimbulu, and became one of the two beile of the Yehe tribe after the death of his brother which took place sometime before 1613. In 1613, Bujantai the beile of the Ula tribe had fled to the Yehe after the defeat of his forces at the hands of Nurhaci. Gintaisi gave him protection and when attacked by Nurhaci, he appealed to the Ming Chinese for help. In 1615, he attempted to appease the Mongols on the west by marrying his cousin (who had eighteen years before been promised to Nurhaci) to the Khalka beile. The alliance with the Chinese in the end proved to be a futile arrangement, for in 1619 Nurhaci defeated a large Chinese army, together with its Yehe auxiliaries at the Battle of Sarhu and then proceeded to besiege Gintaisi in his own stronghold. Despite attempts at a settlement by Nurhaci's son, Hong Taiji the future emperor who was also Gintaisi's nephew, the fighting continued until both Gintaisi and his cousin Buyanggu (Â∏ÉÊèöÂè§) had been captured. Gintaisi was either executed by hanging or he committed suicide, but not before he allegedly cursed Nurhaci that as long as one of his descendants lived, even a female one, he or she would remember the clan's vendetta and bring down the Aisin Gioro. With his death, the independent existence of the Yehe tribe came to an end and the last of the Jurchen tribes under the H≈´lun (alliance) were brought under the control of Nurhaci, but many of its members, including his descendants, became prominent in the service of Nurhaci and of the succeeding Manchu emperors. Even the Empress Dowager Cixi traced her descent back to the Yehe division of the Nara clan, and recognized Yangginu, the father of Gintaisi, as her great ancestor.

Following its French release, it received mixed reviews but was nominated for a Golden Bayard at the International Festival of Francophone Film in Namur, Belgium. The film deals with themes like social exclusion and illegal immigration, along with references to the Romani, as in the other films by the director. Gatlif has also employed the French director Jean-Luc Godard's New Wave techniques in this film.  Plot  Two French pals, one an unemployed young man named Otto (Romain Duris) living with his mother in state housing, and the other his girlfriend Louna (Rona Hartner), who is a hairdresser and has the bailiffs after her, reflect on the lack of meaning in their lives, their society and the system. In a spirit of rebellion against everything, they hit the road and what follows is an anarchic adventure. A teenage Arab immigrant named Ali (Ouassini Embarek) enters the story. Ali's family tries to hide its ethnic origins by going to extreme measures in switching to French customs. The trio start wreaking havoc, robbing shops and stealing cars. On their way, they come across an injured stork with a broken wing. The stork speaks to them and says that it is an Algerian refugee, on its way to Germany to reunite with its family. The trio adopt the stork as their father, name it Mohammed, and forge a passport to enable the stork to cross the French‚ÄìGerman border.  Casting and characterisation  The film's four main characters represent the \\"most vulnerable sections\\" of society, in tune with Gatlif's earlier films portraying \\"social outcasts and racial minorities\\". Otto represents the section of unemployed youth who are neither rich nor qualified, with no hopes for a job in the future. Louna represents the underpaid who are exploited by their employers. The above characters are played by the same duo, Romain Duris and Rona Hartner, who played the leading roles in Gatlif's previous film, Gadjo dilo. The third character, the Arab immigrant, Ali (played by Ouassini Embarek), is going through an identity crisis and has run away from his family, who are trying to distance themselves from their ethnic origins by, for example, adopting French names. Ali is shown to be interested in current affairs and is also shown reading Karl Marx. The other character, the stork, represents illegal immigrants. The film encountered production problems due to a quarrel between Rona Hartner and Gatlif which led to her walking out midway. This resulted in her abrupt disappearance from the plot in the middle until they patched up much later.  Themes and analysis  The film adopts the \\"New Wave\\" technique of early films by Godard, to explore themes of border crossings and social alienation.  Gatlif's take on the New Wave  The reviewer in Film de France remarked that with its themes like absurdity and nonconformity, making use of characters like a speaking stork, and also its filming techniques like jump cuts and multiple exposures, the film feels like \\"a blatant homage to the works of Jean-Luc Godard\\", and the plot \\"looks like a crazy m√©lange of Godard's √Ä bout de souffle, Pierrot le Fou and Weekend\\". In the reviewer's opinion, Gatlif has overdone these techniques, leading to the film's ending up \\"far more substantial and worthy than a shameless appropriation of another director's technique\\". ACiD remarked that with his boldness and unconventional style, Gatlif has started a new New Wave trend, which would serve as a notice for both amateur filmmakers and professional film-makers. Chronic'art remarked that the film can be placed between the worse and the better among the works inspired by Godard. Though the filming techniques are similar to Godard's, the film falls short in its dealing with the unconventional themes, avoiding providing solutions, and rather ending up being a mere \\"passive acquiescence\\" reflecting on the works of revolutionaries of the era, which is far from rising up to revolt as one would expect in a Godard movie. Time Out London was also critical of Gatlif's attempts at Godard, calling it \\"offbeam\\".  Satirical elements  The film is packed with a number of references to \\"social issues and political theory\\", especially on the border crossings. Yet a reviewer for Films de France found it to be not so \\"heavy\\", thanks to the unintentional flaws in the techniques used. He observed that the film treats them using \\"black comedy and surrealism\\". The stork character is a \\"metaphorical stand-in\\" for the illegal immigrant, he added. \\"While birds can cross international borders at ease, human beings generally cannot\\": Tony Gatlif deals with this lesser freedom that human beings possess with his \\"well intended irony\\", using the stork. On forging the passports for the stork and the need for 'papers' while crossing borders, Gatlif said mockingly in an interview that \\"in France there are 1.5 million birds and 1.5 million foreigners. The difference is that the bird is free, because he has no ID. He flies to Africa, to the wealthy countries and to developing countries. It makes no difference to him. He is an alien everywhere\\". ACiD called this \\"poetic\\" while Time Out London found it \\"woolly and unilluminating\\". The word cigogne is pronounced very similarly to tsigane which is one of the words used for Romani people. There are also a number of \\"in-jokes and references to French cinema\\" which a viewer might miss in the first viewing, observed Films de France, citing scenes such as one which is a parody on an awards ceremony and one of an austere reviewer \\"rubber stamping films with trite stock phrases\\". Chronic'art found these scenes heavy because of the limitations of a work in which the director \\"at his pleasure distills his personal tastes\\".  Political alienation  The film's references to revolutionaries like Karl Marx, Che Guevara and Guy Debord coupled with Godard's techniques give it a 1970s feel, observed a reviewer for T√©l√©rama. Though it re-lives the avant-garde of the past, it is a bit retro for the current times, which bores its viewers, he added. Les Inrockuptibles also found the theme \\"dated\\", adding that it could very well have been a documentary by some non-profit organisation like GISTI. Chronic'art remarked that mere quoting of Marx or Che Guevera would not make the film, with its rather common theme of socially disillusioned, unemployed youth in revolt, achieve anything. It also called the depictions of idiotic CRS personnel and militant NF activists clich√©d.  Release  The film was screened at the 1999 Festival International du Film Francophone de Namur, in Belgium, competing against films from Qu√©bec, France, Vietnam, Belgium, S√©n√©gal and Egypt for the Golden Bayard award in the Best Film category, which was won by Christine Carri√®re's Nur der Mond schaut zu. The film received rave reviews for its rare courage in presenting disconcerting themes such as unemployment and illegal immigration. In 2000, it was screened at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in the official section and received praise for its unconventional elements, such as the talking stork. The Festival Internacional de Cine de R√≠o de Janeiro screened the film in the non-competitive Panorama du cin√©ma mondial section, along with 27 other films from around the world. In 2008, the film was screened at L'Alternativa, Festival de Cine Independiente de Barcelona in the parallels section, La pasi√≥n gitana, along with a selection of other films directed by Tony Gatlif with Romani themes.  Reception   Critical reception  Time Out London called it \\"far more fanciful and pretentitious\\" than Gatlif's earlier films and also regarded Gatlif's treatment of Godard as a failure. ACiD gave it a positive review, lauding Gatlif's bold depiction of absurdity. Romain Duris and Rona Hartner's performance was described as \\"beautiful\\" and as complemented by Ouassini Embarek's, which was described as \\"brilliant\\". In summary, the reviewer suggested the film be called \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\", citing the mixed topics dealt with, and added that it takes the viewers \\"beyond the real, beyond the borders and everything one can imagine\\". A review by James Travers forFilms de France called it the \\"most unconventional\\" of all road movies, with its \\"insanely anarchic portrait of adolescent rebellion\\", adding that it is an \\"ingenious parable of social exclusion and immigration in an uncaring society\\". Travers also wrote that the film's editing and narrative techniques turn into a plus, making it \\"refreshingly fresh and original\\", adding that the \\"patchwork narrative style\\" suits the rebellious nature of the characters very well. Owing to the unconventionality of the film, Louna's disappearance from the plot in the middle does not look very obvious, he added. Les Inrockuptibles called it a \\"tragicomic fable on the notions of borders and free movement of people\\" and added that the film's use of comedy and disjunctive narrative style is only partially successful.

She is a lobbyist and a singer.  Background  Fallin was born and raised in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She is the eldest child and only daughter of Dr. Joseph Price Fallin II and Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin. She has one brother, Joseph Price Fallin III (born September 27, 1990). Fallin attended the University of Oklahoma.  Career  Fallin was a lobbyist starting in January 2010 and resigned when her mother was inaugurated as Governor of Oklahoma on January 15, 2011. She has since started a consulting business. She has also been involved in music projects, including a band called Milk on Milk with her former husband Matt Bacon, and a more recent project called Pink Pony.  Controversy  Native American headdress In March 2014, Fallin was photographed wearing a native headdress. She posted the picture to Facebook with the caption \\"Appropriate Culturation\\", a word play on the phrase \\"cultural appropriation\\". After receiving criticism for the picture, Fallin later issued a statement stating her motives including the phrase, \\"Please forgive us if we innocently adorn ourselves with your beautiful things,\\" regarding Native American culture.Kristi Eaton, \\"Christina Fallin, Daughter Of Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin, Defends Headdress Photo\\", Associated Press at Huffington Post, March 7, 2014. Fallin's statement outraged members of the Muscogee Creek Nation prompting an XoJane article by Joy Harjo titled, \\"I am of the Muscogee Creek Nation and Christina Fallin should have known better.\\" In April 2014, Pink Pony performed at the Norman Music Festival. That morning, the band's Facebook posted a status saying \\"I heard Pink Pony was wearing full regalia tonight\\". Fallin appeared in a shawl that was made from her drapery with \\"sheep\\" written on the back. Native American protesters, led by musician Samantha Crain picketed the show with signs such as \\"I am not a costume.\\" Native activists, such as Summer Wesley (often cited as Chahta Summer) and other members of Eradicating Offensive Native Mascotry (EONM) had been called \\"sheep\\" by Pink Pony, during the earlier incident surrounding the headdress photo, and Fallin's display was perceived as an intentional act of continued disrespect. Ultimately, the controversy reached the point that Governor Mary Fallin issued a statement criticizing her daughter's actions. It read: \\"On Saturday night, while performing at the Norman Music Festival, my daughter acted in a way that I believe was inappropriate. While she will always be my daughter and I love her very much, I don‚Äôt approve of her behavior on that night or that of her band. I have communicated that to Christina. I have great respect for Oklahoma‚Äôs tribal members and I celebrate their traditions and culture. As governor, I work in hand in hand with tribal leaders on everything from disaster response to economic development. Tribal governments are important partners to our state government, and I value the good relationships my administration has cultivated with them.\\" Trailer at Governor's Mansion In July 2015, it was discovered that Fallin had been living for months in a trailer located on the grounds of the Oklahoma Governor's Mansion, attached to the facilities' utilities. Learning that this was in violation of zoning regulations, the Governor pledged to have the trailer removed within a few days.Mills, Chellie (27 July 2015). Gov. Fallin says daughter‚Äôs trailer will be removed from mansion grounds after zoning violation discovered, KFOR-TV  Personal life  In June 2011, Fallin married Matthew William Bacon in Ireland. She filed for an annulment in April 2012. She remarried on July 2, 2012 to Eric K. Smith, seven weeks after the annulment was granted. Christina's husband filed for divorce on November 29, 2012.

Highlights include an 8-megapixel camera, the Genius Button, and a hardware keyboard. The myTouch 4G Slide was unveiled on the T-Mobile website on July 11, 2011. Pre-orders began on July 14, 2011, and the phone was launched on July 26.  History   Development  During development, the myTouch 4G Slide was known as the \\"HTC Doubleshot\\", which was leaked to the public as the phone's official name.  Release  The myTouch 4G Slide was released to the United States on July 26, 2011 through T-Mobile USA. The phone confirmed rumors written in multiple blogs.T-Mobile myTouch 4G Review. Businessinsider.com (2011-08-02). Retrieved on 2011-10-07.  Design  The design of the myTouch 4G Slide is a refinement of that of the myTouch 4G. From the front, the phones look similar; the main differences between the two are small changes to the four physical buttons and a slightly smaller screen (the myTouch 4G Slide has a 3.7-inch screen, and the myTouch 4G a 3.8-inch screen). The backs of the phones, however, are noticeably different. The myTouch 4G Slide is thicker than the myTouch 4G due to the Slide's physical keyboard, which is not present on the myTouch 4G.  Hardware  Physical keyboard and input The myTouch 4G Slide stands out amongst other Android handsets because of its uncommon physical slide-out four-row keyboard. The Keyboard is backlighted when the Ambient Light Sensor detects low light, but this leaves the keyboard hard to see in many common situations. An aftermarket app called Tasker includes control to force the keyboard backlight to stay on. The phone has four physical keys on the front: Home, Menu, Back, and the Genius Button; along with an optical trackpad. \\"Genius\\" is a custom voice command and text- to-speech system powered by Dragon Dictation technologies. The Genius Button replaces the Search button from the myTouch 3G. On the sides, the phone has its camera and volume adjustment buttons. On the top, the phone has its lock/power button.  Screen  The myTouch 4G Slide has a 3.7\\", 480-by-800 pixel, WVGA Super LCD touchscreen. The multi-touch display is designed to be used with either a bare finger or multiple fingers.  Processor and memory  The myTouch 4G Slide features a 1.2 GHz dual-core Snapdragon S3 (Adreno 220 GPU) processor and 768 MB RAM, and supports up to a 32 GB MicroSD card (an 8 GB card typically comes with the phone).  Cameras  The myTouch 4G Slide features a rear-facing 8-megapixel camera capable of recording 1080p video at 30 frames per second, with a dual flash that helps illuminate objects in low-light conditions. The built-in camera software comes with features including Sweepshot, Burstshot, HDR (high dynamic range), and zero shutter lag. In addition, the myTouch 4G Slide has a VGA camera on the front of the device designed for video calls and self-portraits; it is allowed to be used by other applications. The camera has been highly praised by various reviewers. Notably, the technology blog Gizmodo suggested that the myTouch 4G Slide's camera was \\"the best camera phone ever\\".  Battery and power  The device comes pre-installed with a 1520 mAh Li-ion rechargeable battery designed to be user-replaceable. Battery life is stated to be 12.4 days in standby using HSPA+ and 9.8 days in 2G, with a talk time of 6.9 hours (HSPA+) or 8.9 hours (2G).

The battle followed the failure of the First Transjordan attack on Amman fought at the beginning April.Baly 2003 p. 202 During this second attack across the Jordan River, fighting occurred in three main areas. The first area in the Jordan Valley between Jisr ed Damieh and Umm esh Shert the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) defended their advanced position against an attack by units of the Seventh Army based in the Nablus region of the Judean Hills. The second area on the eastern edge of the Jordan Valley where the Ottoman Army garrisons at Shunet Nimrin and El Haud, on the main road from Ghoraniyeh to Amman were attacked by the 60th (London) Division many of whom had participated in the First Transjordan attack. The third area of fighting occurred after Es Salt was captured by the light horse brigades to the east of the valley in the hills of Moab, when they were strongly counterattacked by Ottoman forces converging on the town from both Amman and Nablus. The strength of these Ottoman counterattacks forced the EEF mounted and infantry forces to withdraw back to the Jordan Valley where they continued the Occupation of the Jordan Valley during the summer until mid September when the Battle of Megiddo began. In the weeks following the unsuccessful First Transjordan attack on Amman and the First Battle of Amman, German and Ottoman Empire reinforcements strengthened the defences at Shunet Nimrin, while moving their Amman army headquarters moved forward to Es Salt. Just a few weeks later at the end of April, the Desert Mounted Corps again supported by the 60th (London) Division were ordered to attack the recently entrenched German and Ottoman garrisons at Shunet Nimrin and advance to Es Salt with a view to capturing Amman. Although Es Salt was captured, the attack failed despite the best efforts of the British infantry's frontal attack on Shunet Nimrin and the determined light horse and mounted rifle defences of the northern flank in the Jordan Valley. However, the mounted yeomanry attack on the rear of Shunet Nimrin failed to develop and the infantry attack from the valley could not dislodge the determined Ottoman defenders at Shunet Nimrin. By the fourth day of battle, the strength and determination of the entrenched German and Ottoman defenders at Shunet Nimrin, combined with the strength of attacks in the valley and from Amman in the hills, threatened the capture of one mounted yeomanry and five light horse brigades in the hills, defending Es Salt and attacking the rear of the Shunet Nimrin position, forcing a retreat back to the Jordan Valley. Background The German and Ottoman forces won victories at the first and second battles of Gaza in March and April 1917. But from the last day of October 1917 to the end of the year, the German, Austrian and Ottoman Empires endured a series of humiliating defeats in the Levant, culminating in the loss of Jerusalem and a large part of southern Palestine to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). From just north of the Ottoman frontier with Egypt they were defeated at Gaza, at Sheria and at Beersheba, resulting in a retreat to Jaffa and the Judean Hills.Keogh 1955 pp. 225‚Äì6 The Ottoman Army was again forced to retreat, this time from Capture of Jericho by General Edmund Allenby's force in February 1918.Falls 1930 Vol. 1 pp. 279‚Äì350, 378‚Äì9, Vol. 2 Part I pp. 78‚Äì291, 302‚Äì9, Vol. 2 Part II pp. 650‚Äì7 alt=sketch map shows all the towns, roads and main geographic features In late March and early April, German and Ottoman forces defeated Major Generals John Shea and Edward Chaytor's force at the first Transjordan attack. The Ottoman Fourth Army's VIII Corps' 48th Division with the 3rd and 46th Assault Companies and the German 703rd Infantry Battalion successfully defended Amman against the attack by the Anzac Mounted Division with the 4th (Australian and New Zealand) Battalion Imperial Camel Corps Brigade,Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 662 reinforced by infantry from the 181st Brigade, 60th (London) Division.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Part I pp. 328‚Äì49, Part II, pp. 654‚Äì7 The objective of the First Transjordan operations had been to disable the Hejaz Railway near Amman by demolishing viaducts and tunnels. As Shea's force moved forward, Shunet Nimrin on the main road from Ghoraniyeh to Es Salt and Amman and the town of Es Salt were captured by the infantry and mounted force. While Es Salt was garrisoned by infantry from the 60th (London) Division, two brigades of Chaytor's Anzac Mounted Division (later reinforced by infantry and artillery) continued on to Amman. The operations had only been partly successful by the time large numbers of German and Ottoman reinforcements forced a withdrawal back to the Jordan. The only territorial gains remaining in the EEF's control were the Jordan River crossings at Ghoraniyeh and Makhadet Hajlah, where pontoon bridges had been built and a bridgehead established on the eastern bank.Cutlack 1941, pp. 92, 109Woodward 2006, p. 163Blenkinsop 1925, p. 224 With their lines of communication seriously threatened by attacks in the Jordan Valley, Shea's and Chaytor's forces withdrew to the Jordan Valley, by 2 April 1918, maintaining the captured bridgeheads.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Part I pp. 345‚Äì49 On 21 March, Erich Ludendorff launched the Spring Offensive on the Western Front, coinciding with the start of the first Transjordan attack; overnight the Palestine theatre of war went from the British government's first priority to a \\"side show.\\"Woodward 2006 p. 176 Because of the threat to Allied armies in Europe, 24 battalions ‚Äì 60,000 mostly-British soldiers ‚Äì were sent to Europe as reinforcements. They were replaced by Indian infantry and cavalry from the British Indian Army.Woodward 2006 pp. 169‚Äì70Blenkinsop 1925, pp. 225‚Äì6 The large troop movements these withdrawals and reinforcements required caused a substantial reorganisation of the EEF.Bou 2009 p. 186 Until September, when Allenby's force would be completely reformed and retrained, it would not be in a position to successfully attack both the Transjordan on the right and the Plain of Sharon on the left as well as continuing to hold the centre in the Judean Hills. In the meantime, it seemed essential to occupy the Transjordan to establish closer ties with Britain's important Arab ally, Feisal and the Hejaz Arabs. Until direct contact was made, Allenby could not completely support this force and he knew that if Feisal was defeated, German and Ottoman forces could turn the whole length of the EEF's right flank. This would make their hard-won positions shaky all the way to Jerusalem, and could result in a humiliating withdrawal, possibly to Egypt. Apart from the extremely important military ramifications of such a loss of captured territory, the political fallout could include a negative effect on the Egyptian population, upon whose cooperation the British war effort relied heavily.Allenby report to Henry Wilson Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) in Hughes 1999 p. 75 Allenby hoped that a series of attacks into the hills of Moab could turn Ottoman attention away from the Plain of Sharon, north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast, to the important railway junction at Daraa which, if captured by T.E. Lawrence and Feisal, would seriously dislocate the Ottoman railway and lines of communication in Palestine.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 365 Prelude After the withdrawal from Amman, the British infantry continued operations in the Judean Hills, launching unsuccessful attacks towards Tulkarem between 9 and 11 April with the aim of threatening Nablus.Keogh 1955 pp. 214, 216 Also on 11 April, the Ottoman 48th Infantry Division, reinforced by eight squadrons and 13 battalions, unsuccessfully attacked the Anzac Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, supported in turn by the 10th Heavy Battery and 301st Brigade Royal Field Artillery, in and near the Jordan Valley, at the Ghoraniyeh and Aujah bridgeheads and on Mussallabeh hill.Powles 1922 pp. 218‚Äì9Keogh 1955 pp. 217‚Äì18Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 655 Between 15 and 17 April, Allenby's Hejaz Arab force attacked Ma'an with partially successful results.Hughes 2004 p. 144 Imperial Camel Corps Brigade troops on Mussallabeh hill To support the Hejaz Arab attacks at Ma'an, Lieutenant-General Philip W. Chetwode tried to divert German and Ottoman attention away from them, encourage further operations against Amman, and attract more German and Ottoman reinforcements to Shunet Nimrin instead. He ordered Chaytor to lead an attack on 18 April against the strongly entrenched Shunet Nimrin garrison of 8,000 with a force that included an attached infantry brigade the 180th and the Anzac Mounted Division, supported by a heavy and siege artillery batteries. Also, two battalions from the 20th Indian Brigade held the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 361‚Äì2 Then on 20 April Allenby ordered Lieutenant-General Harry Chauvel of the Desert Mounted Corps to destroy the force at Shunet Nirmin and capture Es Salt with two mounted divisions and an infantry division.Keogh 1955 p. 218Hill 1978 pp. 144‚Äì5Blenkinsop 1925 p. 225Powles 1922 p. 219 During the first Transjordan attack on Amman, the high country had still been in the grip of the wintry wet season, which badly degraded roads and tracks in the area making the movements of large military units extremely difficult. Just a few weeks later, with the rainy season over, movement was considerably easier, but the main road via Shunet Nimrin was heavily entrenched by the Ottoman army and could no longer be used to move on Es Salt; Chauvel's mounted brigades were forced to rely on secondary roads and tracks.Berrie 1949 p. 197 Plans Allenby's ambitious overall concept was to capture a great triangle of land with its tip at Amman, its northern line running from Amman to Jisr ed Damieh on the Jordan River and its southern line running from Amman to the north shore of the Dead Sea.Keogh 1955 p. 219 He ordered Chauvel to make bold and rapid marches, in an attempt to develop the attack into the total overthrow of the whole of the German and Ottoman forces. Allenby confirmed, \\"As soon as your operations have gained the front Amman‚ÄìEs Salt, you will at once prepare for operations northward, with a view to advancing rapidly on Daraa.\\" Chauvel's instructions included the optimistic assessment that it was unlikely that the defenders would risk withdrawing troops from the main battlefront in the Judean Hills to reinforce Shunet Nimrin.Hill 1978 p. 145 Jordan Valley looking south with the Dead Sea in the distance and the plateau of Moab on the left During the first Transjordan attack reinforcements from Nablus in the Judean Hills crossed the Jordan River to attack the northern flank, threatening the supply lines of Shea's force.Keogh 1955 p. 212Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 349 This area, together with the infantry frontal attack on Shunet Nimrin, saw the first stage of the second operation; capturing Jisr ed Damieh, Es Salt and Madaba would allow a base for advances to the Hejaz railway at Amman and the railway junction at Daraa. The Jisr ed Damieh crossing was on the main Ottoman lines of communication from the Ottoman Eighth Army headquarters at Tulkarem to the Ottoman Seventh Army headquarters at Nablus via the Wadi Fara and to the north from Beisan and Nazareth. The German and Ottoman forces at all these places could quickly and easily move reinforcements and supplies to the Fourth Army at Es Salt and on to Amman by crossing the Jordan River at this ford.Cutlack 1941 p. 95Falls Sketch Maps Nos. 12 and 30 Chauvel planned to control this strategically vital crossing and secure the left flank by first moving the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade from the Auja bridgehead to take control of the fords south of Jisr ed Damieh from the western side of the river. Second, the 4th Light Horse Brigade, Australian Mounted Division, would advance up the valley to take control of the road from Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt. With this important flank secure, the 60th (London) Division under Shea was to make a frontal attack on Shunet Nimrin from the Jordan Valley while the Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions commanded by Chaytor and Henry West Hodgson moved north up the Jordan Valley to capture the Jisr ed Damieh. After he left one brigade at Jisr ed Damieh as flank guard, covered from the west bank by the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, the remaining brigades would move up the road to Es Salt, capture the village and launch a second attack on Shunet Nimrin from the rear.Downes 1938 p. 689Powles 1922 p. 220Keogh 1955 p. 220 One brigade of the Anzac Mounted Division was attached to the Australian Mounted Division, while the remainder of the Anzac Mounted Division formed the reserve. Problems Planning for both the first and second Transjordan operations optimistically assumed Ottoman reinforcements would not leave the Judean Hills and cross the river, which would have disastrous effects on the operations.Hughes 1999 p. 76But during the first Transjordan two light horse regiments were attacked by just such a force coming from over the Jisr ed Damieh crossing of the Jordan River in the same mann as the force which attacked the 4th Light Horse Brigade on 1 May. [Keogh 1955 p. 212, Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 349] Neither Chauvel, nor Shea the commander of the 60th (London) Division, were keen on the second Transjordan operations.Hill 1978 p. 146Although the commander of the 60th (London) Division) is referred to as Barrow, it would have been J. Shea who according to Falls commanded the 60th (London) Division in October 1917 and September 1918. Barrows commanded the 4th Cavalry Division which did not take part. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Part II pp. 663 & 671, 667] Chauvel considered the operation impracticable, believing he lacked sufficient striking power and supply capacity.Kinloch 2007 p. 283 On 26 April Chauvel explained his supply problems in detail to General Headquarters (GHQ) and asked to postpone operations against Amman and Jisr ed Damieh. In reply GHQ said they would take Chauvel's points into account before ordering any further advance, but also that the first stage, clearing the country up to the Madaba ‚Äì Es Salt ‚Äì Jisr ed Damieh line, would go ahead. The men of the 60th (London) Division had suffered greatly only a few weeks before during the first Transjordan operations, particularly during the attack on Amman, and had had little time to recover between attacks. Further, tackling the 5,000 strongly entrenched Ottomans around Shunet Nimrin, put on the alert by Chetwode's attack on 18 April, would be a chilling prospect. Chetwode later said that the first and second Transjordan attacks were \\"the stupidest things he [Allenby] ever did.\\" Chauvel had no confidence in the promised Arab support Allenby relied on. The attack on Shunet Nirmin relied heavily on the Beni Sakhr's ability to capture and hold Ain es Sir to cut the German and Ottoman supply line to Shunet Nimrin. Beni Sakhr Envoys from the Bedouin Beni Sakhr tribe, camped on the plateau about east of Ghoraniyeh, informed Allenby that they had 7,000 men concentrated at Madaba who could cooperate in a British advance on the east bank of the Jordan River. But due to supplies they would need to disperse to distant camping grounds by the first week in May. They assured Allenby that as soon as the Hejaz Arabs arrived, they would join them.Keogh 1955 pp. 218‚Äì9 The attacks on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt were planned for about the middle of May, after the promised Indian cavalry divisions arrived.Wavell 1968 p. 184 But Allenby accepted the Beni Sakhr offer and brought the date for operations forward by two weeks, in the hope that the 7,000 Beni Sakhr would make up for the Indian cavalry. The Beni Sakhr offer to join the Hejaz Arabs was also enticing because these two groups together might be able to hold Es Salt and Shunet Nimrin permanently, making it unnecessary for Allenby's force to garrison the Jordan Valley over the summer period. The change in timing rushed preparations for the operations, which were hasty and imperfect as a result.Downes 1938 p. 688 The original instructions for the second Transjordan operations contained only a general statement that considerable help might be counted on from the Beni Sakhr and that Chauvel should keep in close touch with them. GHQ had no clear idea of the capabilities of the Beni Sakhr, but GHQ fitted them into Chauvel's battle and Allenby ordered Chauvel to attack on 30 April. All this happened without asking the opinion of either T. E. Lawrence or Captain Hubert Young, Lawrence's liaison officer with the Beni Sakhr, who was aware that the leader of the Arabs around Madaba was both perplexed and frightened by GHQ's reaction to his envoys. Lawrence was in Jerusalem during the Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt operations and claimed no knowledge of the Beni Sakhr, or their leader.Lawrence 1962 pp. 539‚Äì40 British Empire aircraft flying over the plains around Madaba saw large numbers of Bedouin ploughing their fields and grazing their animals, until they decamped across the Hejaz railway when attack on Shunet Nimrin began.Cutlack 1941 p. 114 Defending forces At this time the headquarters of the German commander in chief of the Ottoman armies in Palestine, Otto Liman von Sanders, was at Nazareth.

The Fourth Army headquarters was defended by three companies. In the hills of Moab beyond the Jordan, Ottoman forces were at least two thousand stronger than British GHQ estimated.Hill 1978 p. 148 Amman was held by two or three battalions, possibly the German 146th Regiment's 3/32nd, 1/58th, 1/150th Battalions.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Part II p. 657 a Composite Division, a German infantry company and an Austrian artillery battery.

After the first Transjordan attack on Amman, the 3rd Cavalry Division, the Caucasus Cavalry Brigade and several German infantry units which moved to the northern Jordan Valley had reinforced the Fourth Army under Jemal Pasha. These infantry units were based mainly on the west bank near Mafid Jozele where a pontoon bridge had been built. The Ottoman 24th Infantry Division, less one regiment and artillery, was also in the area and detachments patrolled the east bank to the south to maintain touch with Fourth Army patrols from Es Salt.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Parts I & II pp. 393 & 657 Also part of their force was a Circassian Cavalry Regiment of Arab and Circassian tribesmen. After the attack began Liman von Sanders requested reinforcements from the commander at Damascus who was to send all available troops by rail to Daraa. Two German infantry companies moving westward by rail from Daraa were ordered to de-train and join the Ottoman 24th Infantry Division. At Shunet Nimrin the VIII Corps held their ground while troops moved against the left flank of the Desert Mounted Corps.Hill 1978 p. 149 The Ottoman Seventh Army formed a new provisional combat detachment designed to counter-attack into the British flank.Erickson 2007, p. 134This demonstrated the continuing ability of the Ottoman army to reorganise combat groups quickly to react to new combat conditions. [Erickson 2007, p. 134] On 1 May the Ottoman troops which pushed in the 4th Light Horse Brigade's flank guard near Jisr ed Damieh, were the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division and part of an infantry division (probably the VIII Corps' 48th Division) part of whom continued on up the road to attack Es Salt.Preston 1921 pp. 165‚Äì6 Attacking force While the remainder of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force held the front line from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea and garrisoned the captured territories, Chauvel the commander of Desert Mounted Corps, replaced Chetwode, who was the commander of the XX Corps, as commander of the Jordan Valley. Chauvel took command of the Jordan Valley, as well as responsibility for second Transjordan operations.Brief Record of the Advance of the EEF 1919 pp. 37‚Äì79 Chauvel's force was one mounted division stronger than the one that attacked Amman the month before, consisting of ‚Äì *the 60th (London) Division, an infantry division, commanded by Major General John Shea (less the 181st Brigade in reserve in the Judean Hills on the XX Corps front) *the 20th Indian Brigade commanded by Brigadier General E.

The Australian Mounted Division, which had been in rest camp near Deir el Belah from 1 January to April, moved via Gaza and Mejdel to Deiran from Jaffa in preparation to take part in the attacks northwards towards Tulkarem, known by the Ottomans as the action of Berukin from 9 to 11 April, however the engagement did not develop to a point where the mounted division could be deployed. This action of Berukin was similar to but on a much smaller scale than the initial attacks which began the Battle of Megiddo (1918) five months later; in this case the losses were heavy and the gains small; 1,500 British casualties and about 200 Ottoman dead on the battlefield with 27 Ottoman and German prisoners captured. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 350‚Äì7] During this time the Australian Mounted Division remained close to the front line, able to hear heavy bombardments from time to time both day and night and see increased aircraft operations.Falls 1930 Vol 2 pp. 350‚Äì7Hamilton 1996 pp. 106‚Äì7 After training and refitting at Deiran, on 23 April the division marched via Jerusalem and the next day down to the Jordan Valley to join the Anzac Mounted Division near Jericho.Hamilton 1996 pp. 107 & 110 37th Company, the 4th Light Horse Brigade's supply and transport details The Australian Mounted Division crossed the Jordan River at Ghoraniyeh on a pontoon bridge just wide enough for one vehicle or two horses abreast.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 369Hamilton 1996 p.110 Then, led by the 4th Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General William Grant) the division advanced rapidly northwards to Jisr ed Damieh; the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General Lachlan Wilson) continuing on to ride hard from Jisr ed Damieh to capture Es Salt. Meanwhile, the 4th Light Horse Brigade supported by at least two Royal Horse Artillery batteries took up their position of flank guard astride the Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt road facing north-west opposite a strong German and Ottoman position holding the bridge over the Jordan River.Major General Hodgson's written orders did not tell him to seize the crossing, but to establish a force astride the track leading from it towards Es Salt. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 369] The 5th Mounted Brigade (Brigadier General Philip Kelly) followed by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General Granville Ryrie) moved towards Es Salt along the Umm esh Shert track. They were followed later by the 1st Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier General Charles Cox) which remained across the track as guard for a time.Downes 1938 p. 690When fighting dismounted, one quarter of the light horse, mounted rifle and yeomanry were holding the horses, a dismounted brigade in the firing line was equivalent in rifle strength to an infantry battalion. [Preston 1921 p.168] The force attacking Shunet Nimrin from the west was made up of the 179th and 180th Brigades (commanded by Brigadiers General FitzJ. M. Edwards and C. F.

On the same day the 10th (Irish) Division occupied Mezra north-west of 'Arura. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 368] The Anzac Mounted Division had one regiment from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade covering the right flank of the 60th (London) Division, and the 7th Light Horse Regiment, from the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, attached to the 60th Division. Their 1st Light Horse Brigade was attached to the Australian Mounted Division, and the remainder formed a reserve.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 368 Air support Bombing raids on the German and Ottoman rear were carried out by No. 142 Squadron RAF (Martinsyde G.100s and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12a's) while roaming destroyer patrols over the whole front were carried out by No. 111 Squadron RAF (Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s). Aerial reconnaissance patrol aircraft flew as far as behind enemy lines locating several suspected Ottoman headquarters, new aerodromes, important railway centres, new railway and road works, dumps, parks of transport and troop camps. Strategic reconnaissance missions which had been carried out before the first Transjordan attack, were repeated by No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps; during 20 photography patrols over the eastern Jordan, 609 photographs were taken. The new information about all local roads, tracks and caravan routes in the Amman and Es Salt district was incorporated into revised maps.Cutlack 1941 pp. 95 & 113 To stop the possibility of repetitions of attacks by German and Ottoman aircraft during the concentration of Chauvel's force, as had occurred prior to the first Transjordan operations, patrols were increased over the area during daylight hours.Cutlack 1941 pp. 112‚Äì3 These appear to have been completely successful as despite the size of the force, Liman von Sanders claims, \\"so secretly and ably had their [British Empire] preparations been carried out that even the most important were hidden from our aviators and from ground observation\\".Bruce 2002 pp. 199‚Äì200 Battle 30 April Infantry in the Jordan Valley attack Shunet Nimrin From the Ghoraniyeh crossing, a metaled road extended across the Jordan Valley to the Shunet Nimrin defile at the foot of the hills of Moab.Downes 1938 p. 682Wavell 1968 pp. 180‚Äì1 Here at Shunet Nimrin opposite the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead and crossing, the Ottoman Fourth Army's VIII Corps was strongly entrenched in positions, which controlled the main sealed road from Jericho to Es Salt and Amman and the Wadi Arseniyat (Abu Turra) track.Preston 1921 pp. 156‚Äì7Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 377‚Äì8 noteThe Wadi Arseniyat and Wadi Abu Turra tracks are the same track. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 330 note] The Ottoman Corps' main entrenchments ran north and south just to the west of Shunet Nimrin with the deep gorge of the Wadi Kerfrein forming their left flank while their right was thrown back in a half circle across the Wadi Arseniyat track to El Haud. Both flanks were protected by cavalry and the garrison was ordered to hold the strongly entrenched position of Shunet Nimrin at all costs. Their lines of communication to Amman ran through Es Salt and along the Wady Es Sir via the village of Ain es Sir. Chauvel's plan was to envelop and capture the Shunet Nimrin garrison and cut their lines of communication; firstly by the capture of Es Salt by light horse who would block the main road to Amman and secondly by the Beni Sakhr who were to capture Ain es Sir and block that track. With Shunet Nimrin isolated there was every reason to believe a frontal attack by British infantry from the Jordan Valley, with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade covering their right flank, would succeed.Cutlack 1941 p. 112Chauvel had employed this tactic of envelopment successfully at the Battle of Magdhaba see \\"Map of Magdhaba, showing Ottoman redoubts in green and attacking forces in red\\" and at the Battle of Rafa see \\"Powles' map showing the attack on Rafa and El Magruntein,\\"[Cutlack 1941 pp. 49‚Äì51] was very nearly successfully at the First Battle of Gaza see Map \\"Position at about 1800\\" [Bruce 2002 p. 92, Cutlack 1941 p. 59] The infantry attack was launched in bright moonlight at the same time as the Australian light horse galloped north along the eastern bank of the Jordan River towards Jisr ed Damieh.Keogh 1955 p. 221 By 02:15 leading infantry battalions were deployed opposite their first objectives which were away. The infantry captured the advanced German and Ottoman outposts line in the first rush but the second line of solid entrenched works were strongly defended and by mid morning cross-fire from concealed machine guns had brought the advance to a standstill. As soon as the 179th Brigade on the left emerged from cover to attack El Haud they were seen in the moonlight and fired on by these machine guns. Some slight progress was made by the 2/14th Battalion, London Regiment, 179th Brigade which captured 118 prisoners but progress became impossible due to heavy and accurate machine gun fire. Before dawn the 180th Brigade on the right made three attempts to gain two narrow paths but was fired on by machine guns and failed to reach their objective; the 2/20th Battalion, London Regiment managed to decisively defeat a reserve company killing 40 German or Ottoman soldiers and capturing 100 prisoners.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 369‚Äì70 Without the advantage of good observation the protracted artillery fire-fight which developed was lost by the British gunners who had problems getting ammunition forward over the fire- swept lower ground and at critical moments the infantry lacked much needed fire support owing to great difficulties in communicating with the artillery. It was eventually decided to stop the attack and to resume it the next morning. After sunset the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade withdrew into reserve by the Ghoraniyeh bridge leaving the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment with the 180th Brigade. The first infantry casualties arrived from Shunet Nimrin at the divisional receiving station three hours after the fighting began: two hours later they were at the corps main dressing station and later that day they reached the casualty clearing station at Jerusalem. By evening 409 cases had been admitted to the Anzac Mounted Division receiving station and evacuation was going on smoothly. To keep the station clear of casualties, on the following day the motor lorries, general service wagons and some of the light motor ambulances that had been brought inside the bridgehead were used to supplement the heavy cars taking the wounded back for treatment.Downes 1938 p. 691 Light horse advance up Jordan River's east bank The Australian Mounted Division with the 1st Light Horse Brigade, the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery and the 12th Light Armoured Motor Battery (LAMB) attached, crossed the Ghoraniyeh bridge at 04:00 on the morning of 30 April. The 4th Light Horse Brigade with the Australian Mounted Division's \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Batteries HAC and the Nottinghamshire Battery RHA attached led the 3rd Light Horse Brigade north from the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead up the flat eastern bank of the Jordan towards Jisr ed Damieh.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 368‚Äì69Bruce 2002 p. 200 11th Light Horse Regiment (4th Light Horse Brigade) crossing the Jordan River The 4th Light Horse Brigade was to act as the northern flank guard to prevent German and Ottoman forces moving from the east to the west bank of the Jordan River, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade with six guns of the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery advanced up the road from Jisr ed Damieh to capture Es Salt.Gullett 1941 p. 605 If the 4th Light Horse Brigade were unable to capture the crossing they were to be deployed in such a way as cover and block this important route from Nablus and Beisan to Es Salt.Falls 1930 Vol 2 p. 369During the first Transjordan attack on Amman a few weeks previously, the job of the 4th Light Horse Brigade had been done by two regiments of the 1st Light Horse Brigade. At the same time as the two light horse brigades moved north on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade was to move up the western bank to cover the Umm esh Shert crossing south of Jisr ed Damieh. The 1st Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades, the Australian Mounted Division headquarters and two mountain batteries were to ride up the Umm esh Shert track to Es Salt. For from the Wady Nimrin to the Jisr ed Damieh the terrain on the eastern side of the Jordan river was favourable for rapid movement by the mounted force; the Jordan river valley from the Wady Nimrin across the Wadi Arseniyat (which flows into the Jordan) to Umm esh Shert the flats were about wide but further north narrowed between foot-hills on the east and mud-hills along the river. Beyond Umm esh Shert the height of Red Hill jutted out from beside the Jordan to dominate the valley with encroaching foot-hills to the east. Ottoman fire was expected from guns attacking the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade on the west side of the river but Grant (commander of 4th Light Horse Brigade) relied on speed to get past machine gun and rifle fire from the foothills on his right and on his left from Red Hill and the mud-hills.Gullett 1941 pp. 603‚Äì4 Firing from Red Hill and the western side of the river sent shrapnel bursting over the scattered squadrons whose pace was increased to a gallop.Gullett 1941 p. 604 Posts held by the Ottoman cavalry formed a defensive line extending across the valley from Umm esh Shert.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 371 This defensive line formed a line of communications, linking the German and Ottoman forces in the Fourth Army west of the Jordan River with the VIII Corps defending Shunet Nimrin. These defensive posts were attacked by the 4th Light Horse Brigade mounted, and driven back towards Mafid Jozele north of Umm esh Shert. While the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades continued northwards the 1st Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade) was ordered to attack the German and Ottoman force on Red Hill about north-east of Umm esh Shert.Gullett 1941 p. 606 As the light horse screens advanced the mud-hills became more prominent, the passages deeper than they were further south and the two brigades were soon confined to a few broad winding wadi passages studded with large bushes. Ottoman resistance quickly developed along their whole front and the light horsemen were checked and held while still from Jisr ed Damieh at 05:30 on 30 April.Gullett 1941 pp. 604‚Äì5Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 372Bruce claimed the 4th Light Horse Brigade arrived at Jisr ed Damieh at 17:30. [Bruce 2002 p. 200] Detail of Sketch Map No. 24 showing Jordan Valley from the Dead Sea to Jisr ed Damieh A squadron of the 11th Light Horse Regiment was sent forward at 08:00 to capture the Jisr ed Damieh bridgehead, but could not get closer than and even though the squadron was reinforced, they were attacked across the Jisr ed Damieh bridge by German and Ottoman infantry supported by a squadron of cavalry which forced the Australians to withdraw about eastwards. German and Ottoman forces then secured the bridge and German and Ottoman reinforcements were able to cross over the Jordan River as the bridge was no longer under observation nor threat from British artillery. Later two squadrons of the 12th Light Horse Regiment attempted to push along the Es Salt track onto the Jisr ed Damieh bridge but were unsuccessful. Meanwhile, a light horse patrol pushed northwards and at 08:00 reached Nahr ez Zerka (Wady Yabbok) about north of Jisr ed Damieh.Gullett 1941 p. 604-6Preston 1921 pp. 157‚Äì8 The 4th Light Horse Brigade initially took up a line long with both flanks exposed facing north- west about west of the foothills covering the Jisr el Damieh to Es Salt track. This line stretched from the Nahr el Zerka to a point about south of the Es Salt track. They were supported by the Australian Mounted Division's XIX Brigade RHA which were pushed forward to cover the bridge at Jisr ed Demieh and the track leading down from Nablus on the west side. These batteries were ineffective as the range was extreme, the targets indefinite and the defensive fire power of the light 13-pounder guns small. About midday, the 1st Light Horse Regiment captured Red Hill and took over the prominent position after some intense fighting while its former German and Ottoman garrison retired across the Jordan to where there were already greatly superior enemy reinforcements. An attempt to approach these forces between Red Hill and Mafid Jozele by the light horse was stopped by heavy machine gun fire from the large force. At 15:00, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was directed by Desert Mounted Corps to move up the Umm esh Shert track to Es Salt, leaving one squadron on Red Hill. There was a gap of between the 4th Light Horse Brigade's left, which was held by the 11th Light Horse Regiment, and the squadron of 1st Light Horse Regiment on Red Hill supported by two squadrons deployed at the base of the hill.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 372‚Äì73Baly 2003 pp. 204‚Äì5 Two armoured cars of the 12th Light Armoured Motor Battery were ordered by Grant to watch the gap on the left flank between Red Hill and Jisr ed Damieh. One of those cars was fairly quickly put out of action by a direct hit from a German or Ottoman shell (or was abandoned after being stuck in a deep rut), but the other remained in action until the following day when it was forced to retire, owing to casualties and lack of ammunition.Falls 1930 Vol 2. p. 376 Chauvel came to inspect the deployments about 16:00 in the afternoon, when Grant (commander of 4th Light Horse Brigade) explained his difficulties, and requested another regiment to reinforce Red Hill. Chauvel had already sanctioned the move by the 1st Light Horse Brigade to Es Salt, leaving the squadron on Red Hill with four machine guns under Grant's orders and had withdrawn the 2nd Light Horse Brigade from supporting infantry in the 60th (London) Division, ordering it to follow the 1st Light Horse to Es Salt. He therefore had no spare troops and directed Grant to withdraw from Nahr ez Zerka but to continue to hold the Nablus to Es Salt road where it entered the hills towards Es Salt. After Chauvel returned to his headquarters, Grant was warned by Brigadier General Richard Howard-Vyse the Brigadier General General Staff head of G Branch (BGGS) to deploy his artillery batteries so that if necessary, they could be certain of being able to safely withdraw.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 373 Aerial photograph of Jisr ed Damieh photographed from the southwest at 10:00 21 March 1918 On their way to Jisr ed Damieh, the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Field Ambulances [LHFA] were heavily shelled while following in the rear of their brigades.For a description of German and Ottoman artillery firing on the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance see Hamilton 1996 p. 112. An advanced dressing station was formed by the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance about north of the Umm esh Shert track, to serve both 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades. After sending its wheeled transport back to Ghoraniyeh bridgehead, the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance with their camels and horses made the journey on foot through the hills up the Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt road, which went along the edges of very steep and in parts very slippery cliffs. At 20:00 they halted for the night in a wadi east of Es Salt. Camels move up western bank At the same time as the light horse began their advance up the eastern bank, on the western bank of the Jordan River the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade supported by Staffordshire Yeomanry, the 383rd Siege Battery and the XVIII Brigade RHA held the Auja bridgehead and was to be prepared to advance its right at 04:00 to cover the western approaches to the Umm esh Shert crossing north of the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead. This force was to establish a post, from which it could dominate the fords south of Jisr ed Damieh, at a point where the Jordan bends sharply westward north-west of Umm esh Shert.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 366‚Äì7Keogh 1955 pp. 220 & 222Gullett's Maps 33 and 34 below show they were not able to get into a position to dominate the fords and were unable to advance during the day. The Imperial Camel Corps Brigade was stopped north- west of Umm esh Shert when confronted by strong opposition west of the river which may have included the Cossack posts dislodged by the light horse advance which had fallen back to Mafid Jozele north of Umm esh Shert and the garrison from Red Hill (about halfway between Umm esh Shert and Mafid Jozele) which had been forced off by the 1st Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade). During the evening of 30 April Chauvel received reports of a pontoon bridge at Mafid Jozele and ordered the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade to attack it in the morning and destroy it. The squadron of 1st Light Horse Regiment with their four machine guns on Red Hill was instructed to cooperate from their position east of the river. Grant also instructed the 11th Light Horse Regiment (4th Light Horse Brigade) at Jisr ed Damieh to dispatch another squadron to Red Hill to assist in the destruction of the Mafid Jozele bridge; it set off at 06:00 on 1 May, by which time considerable movement could be seen to the north and it was evident large numbers of Ottoman troops had crossed the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 375 Capture of Es Salt At 06:30 on 30 April, the commander of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier- General Wilson) had a brief conference with the commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade (Brigadier-General Grant) before his brigade began the climb up the Jisr ed Damieh road to Es Salt. Each man carried 230 rounds of ammunition; for each Hotchkiss machine-gun there were 3,100 rounds and for each machine gun 5,000 rounds. The brigade's six guns of the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Battery were carried, together with their ammunition, on a train of 360 camels. A further 29 camels with cacolets, completing the column.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 373‚Äì4 As the brigade moved along the road an observer noted the whole brigade took three hours to pass a designated point.The routes used were the Na'ur track, the Ain es Sir track, the Wadi Abu Turra track (also known as the Wadi Arseniyat track \\"owing to a defective map\\") and the Umm esh Shert track. The main road from Ghoraniyeh had been blocked at Shunet Nimrin by Ottoman forces. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 330] The road from Nablus via Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt was employed by both sides at different times during the course of the engagements. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade surprised an Ottoman cavalry outpost north-west of Es Salt on the Jebel Jil'ad but the supporting troop escaped to give the alarm to German and Ottoman units holding a number of sangars in some strength further along the road. The 9th Light Horse Regiment was sent against these German and Ottoman defenders' right flank situated on a detached hillock which was quickly seized and from there the light horse opened an enfilade fire on the main position. Then under covering fire from the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Battery, another dismounted bayonet attack was launched frontally by the 9th Light Horse Regiment and 10th Light Horse Regiment. After a determined assault the German and Ottoman defenders were driven from the position with a loss of 28 prisoners; casualties are unknown. The Victorians in the 8th Light Horse Regiment which had been in reserve, immediately mounted and galloped into Es Salt despite fire from isolated groups of German or Ottoman soldiers in the hills. The town was full of German and Ottoman troops who were surprised by this sudden charge and the hustling tactics of the Australians broke up all attempts to organise a cohesive defence. A German officer who was attempting to rally soldiers, was forced to surrender to the leader of the first troop to enter the town at 18:30; Lieutenant C.D. Foulkes‚ÄìTaylor threatened the officer with his sword and service revolver.Bostock 1982 p. 147Preston 1921 p.159 Ottoman/German prisoners captured by the light horse at Es Salt Captures included prisoners who were equal to at least twice the fighting strength of the dismounted light horse regiment (without swords and carrying their rifles on their backs, light horse had no weapon to fight mounted) as well as 30 machine guns and large quantities of other war material.Gullett 1919 p. 20 The 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments remounted quickly and followed the 8th Regiment into the town where a total of 400 prisoners were captured by 19:00 together with a large number of machine guns and all the papers and documents of the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters. The commander of 3rd Light Horse Brigade had orders to seize the junction of the road from Amman to Es Salt via Suweile with the Madaba to Es Salt roads at Ain Hummar on the opposite side of the town. At 20:00 one or possibly two squadrons from the 8th Light Horse Regiment pursued escaping German and Ottoman soldiers some distance down the Amman road until machine gun fire from a strong rearguard position stopped their advance from the junction with the Madaba road. The enemy position was situated astride the road at Ain Hummar, just west of the junction; here the light horsemen set up pickets and remained facing the German and Ottoman position until daylight.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 374 Meanwhile, climbed the escarpment on the central Umm esh Shert track (halfway between the Jisr ed Damieh and the Ghorianyeh roads) towards Es Salt were the 1st and 2nd Light Horse and the 5th Mounted Brigades with the Australian Mounted Division's headquarters and two batteries of mountain guns. This track was so steep and narrow that all were forced to lead their horses in single file; making only very slow progress.Preston 1921 pp. 159‚Äì60 The leading yeomanry brigade encountered some resistance from small parties of German or Ottoman machine gunners which had to be outflanked and the force did not reach the plateau until twilight where they bivouacked for the night unaware the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had captured Es Salt. The first troops of this column reached Es Salt early in the morning on 1 May. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade advanced through the town and along the Amman road to Ain Hummar where they drove off the German and Ottoman rearguard and occupied the road junction. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade held an outpost line north-west and north of Es Salt and the 1st Light Horse Brigade held a similar line to the west, astride the Umm esh Shert track. The three brigades thus formed a cordon round the town on the east, north, and west.The 6th Mounted Brigade was on the west bank of the Jordan protecting Musallabeh as Chauvel thought there was some risk of an Ottoman attack there. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 373] The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade remained in the Jordan Valley covering the flanks of the infantry as they continued their attack on Shunet Nimrin. The 5th Mounted Field Ambulance followed its brigade up the Umm esh Shert track leaving both vehicles and camels at the foot of the hills east of the divisional collecting station. The 1st and 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulances accompanied their brigades; the 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance with nine of its cacolet camels, reached Es Salt while the 1st Light Horse Field Ambulance without any transport animals, remained with its brigade down the Umm esh Shert to Es Salt track. The four brigades around Es Salt had 29 cacolet camels, a captured German motor ambulance wagon and driver and a number of captured motor cars and wagons. All these were employed to transport the wounded from the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulances back to the Jordan Valley. Preparations for a counter-attack About 08:30 Liman von Sanders, the commander of Ottoman forces in Palestine, was at his headquarters in Nazareth when he was informed about the second Transjordan incursion. He phoned the Seventh Ottoman Army headquarters at Nablus north west of Jisr ed Damieh, ordering the concentration of the 24th Infantry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division. They were to be sent towards either the Jisr ed Damieh or Mafid Jozele with a view to crossing the river and counter-attacking Chauvel's northern flank and lines of communication to Es Salt.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 393See Sketch map 24 The Ottoman Seventh Army had formed a new provisional combat detachment designed to launch counter-attacks into the British Empire flank. This detachment was developed by infantry in the Ottoman 24th Division's assault company. This special unit had been expanded in late April into an assault battalion made up of the Ottoman 143rd Infantry Regiment, the 24th Assault Battalion of the infantry's 24th Division, the 6th Cavalry Regiment supported by the 3rd Horse Artillery Battery (3rd Cavalry Division) and the German 1st Battalion, 146th Infantry Regiment (German Asia Korps).Erickson 2007 p. 134, Table 5.2 p. 135 Early in the afternoon of 30 April, columns of German and Ottoman troops were observed marching down to the west bank of the Jordan River and were fired on by the three Australian Mounted Division batteries. They appeared to dispersed, disappearing among the broken ground on the far side of the river but they were moving towards the pontoon bridge at Mafid Jozele between Red Hill and Jisr ed Damieh.Preston 1921 p.158 During the night the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division and infantry in the 24th Division (less 2nd Regiment), crossed the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh and concealed themselves in the foothills to the north-west of the 4th Light Horse Brigade while the 2nd Regiment (24th Division) crossed the Jordan at the lower bridge [Mafid Jozele] but the Ottoman Seventh Army ordered it back to the Jisr ed Damieh crossing. Had the attack of the 2nd Regiment continued the withdrawal may have ended with the capture of the light horse brigade.Keogh 1955 p. 222Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 386 1 May Infantry continue attack on Shunet Nimrin After a 75 minutes-long bombardment at 05:30 the infantry launched fresh attacks on the same objectives as the previous day. By 10:00 Chauvel was urging the 60th (London) Division to press its attack with additional forces; infantry from the 20th Indian Brigade was sent forward and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) were sent to reinforce infantry in the 179th Brigade.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 377 These attacks were halted 20 minutes later after gaining ground which would form a favourable base from which to launch further offensives.Keogh 1955 pp. 222‚Äì3 A company of the 2/18th Battalion London Regiment captured two sangars and a few prisoners on tel Buleibil; this being the only success of the day.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 374‚Äì5 The 60th (London) Division fought hard to capture the position at Shunet Nimrin but without success; every attack ran into heavy enfiladed machine gun fire from positions which were so successfully concealed that they could not be found by the infantry's supporting artillery.Keogh 1955 p. 224 The fire from the German and Ottoman machine guns was so effectively directed and concentrated on the edge of scrub, which gave cover for the British infantry approach but did not extend to the foot of the hills, that these machine guns defeated all infantry efforts to cross the open ground. The Beni Sakhr had been asked to cut the road through Ain es Sir from Amman, which had been upgraded to allow a smooth flow of troops and supplies. The Beni Sakhr had failed to cut the road and towards evening German and Ottoman reinforcements from Amman which had moved along this road, began to reinforce Shunet Nimrin.Bruce 2002 p. 201 Having seen the difficulties suffered by infantry from the 60th (London) Division the Beni Sakhr had already dispersed; playing no part in the fighting.Bou 2009 p. 187Cutlack 1941 p. 115 German and Ottoman attack in the Jordan Valley After the first Transjordan attack on Amman, the Ottoman 4th Army east of the Jordan River had been reinforced by the 3rd Cavalry Division, the Caucasus Cavalry Brigade, a Circassian Cavalry Regiment and the German 146th Regiment which was stationed in the northern Jordan Valley, with the 24th Division also in the area.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 Parts I and II, pp. 393 & 657 Gullett Map 33 ‚Äì Position at about 08:00 1 May 1918 Two hours after the 60th (London) Division renewed its attack on Shunet Nimrin, at about 07:30 the northern flank guard provided by the 4th Light Horse Brigade (commanded by Brigadier General William Grant) was suddenly threatened by the Ottoman 24th Infantry Division less the 2nd Regiment and the German 146th Infantry Regiment which had crossed the Jordan River unseen during the night.Preston 1921 p. 160Keogh 1955 p. 223Hughes 1999 pp. 73 & 86The northern flank guard during the First Transjordan attack on Amman (1918) from 24 to 31 March and until 2 April (when they formed part of the rearguard), had been the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments (1st Light Horse Brigade) supported by artillery and a Light Armoured Motor Battery [L. A. M. B]. These two regiments had taken it in turn to defend the Umm esh Shert track from increasingly strong Ottoman forces which had crossed the river at Jisr ed Damieh. [1st Light Horse Brigade's War Diary March and April 1918 AWM 4-10-1-44, 45] This strong Ottoman force advanced from the broken ground east of the Jordan, in open order with their right flank directed on the gap between the left of the 4th Light Horse Brigade and Red Hill. They advanced in two waves; the first, estimated by the commander of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at 4,000 Ottoman soldiers and the second, at 1,500 soldiers.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 375‚Äì6 Note & p. 393 These figures have been disputed; \\"independent Turkish and German accounts\\" claim 1,750 formed the first wave (the Ottoman 143rd Infantry Regiment, a storm battalion with one German company in reserve or two German companies and a German machine gun company), while the second wave was made up of three or four regiments (two regiments from the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division with one or two regiments from the Caucasus Cavalry Brigade).Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 375‚Äì6 Note & p. 393 The Ottoman attacking force emerged from cover, from the direction of Jisr ed Damieh and moved quickly against the light horse on a wide front. At the same time the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division appeared further north and moved into the foothills towards the light horse's right.This attack demonstrated a high degree of effective planning and coordination between Liman von Sanders' Fourth Army (headquartered at Es Salt) and his Seventh Army (headquartered at Nablus). [Hughes 1999 pp. 73 & 86] While the attackers moved over open ground the three batteries of XIX Brigade RHA, Australian Mounted Division opened a rapid and accurate fire on the advancing soldiers. These guns continued firing on the strong attacking force while at the same time being heavily shelled by German, Austrian and Ottoman batteries from the west bank of the Jordan. The attack proceeded very rapidly; soon enemy forces on the right overlapped the light horse's left in the valley and forces on their left quickly turned the light horse's northern flank in the foothills requiring a hasty withdrawal. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was being attacked from three directions; from the Nahr ez Zerka on the light horse's right and from Jisr ed Damieh in the centre.Wavell 1968 pp. 186‚Äì7 A third group, the 2nd Regiment had crossed the Jordan at the lower bridge at Mafid Jozele north of Red Hill but the Ottoman Seventh Army ordered it back to the Jisr ed Damieh crossing.Wavell claims this third group advanced into the gap between Red Hill and the light horse's left after crossing the pontoon bridge at Mafid Jozele. [Wavell 1968 pp. 186‚Äì7] Hughes also claims the Nablus force crossed at Mafid Jozele. [Hughes 1999 p. 86] These claims are not supported by Keogh or Falls and Gullett's Map 33 indicates the whole attacking force used the bridge at Jisr ed Damieh. The main attack was towards that part of the line held by the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments which was forced back until they were facing due west, with their backs to the tangled maze of, for cavalry and guns, impassable rocky hills.Preston 1921 p.162Gullett 1941 pp. 614‚Äì5 The 4th Light Horse Regiment supported by ‚ÄòA‚Äô Battery HAC on the right or northern flank, had held their position until the attackers closed to within when they began their slow withdrawal into the hills. The Nottinghamshire Battery RHA was positioned near the centre of the brigade but each time an attack broke and melted away before the light horse fire from rifles and the guns, the German and Ottoman dead lay a little closer to the guns of these two batteries. Each time a short retirement was made, the heavy pressure of the attackers pushed the guns further into the hills and each time there were fewer men and horses to move the guns. They were forced into a position from which there was no escape fighting till all their ammunition was exhausted and the German and Ottoman attackers were within on three sides. Then the teams of horses were killed by machine gun fire and the nine 13‚Äìpounder guns were abandoned while the remaining men and horses scrambled up the hills to the east and succeeded in reaching the Wadi el Retem just to the north of the Umm esh Shert track. While the dismounted light horse could retire east into the hills if necessary, the three batteries of artillery now had no apparent way out to the east or south. The 4th Light Horse Brigade's guns had been pushed back into gullies, from where they had to move almost due west before they could turn south down the valley; \\"B\\" Battery on the left or southern side managed to get away with the loss of one gun. However, \\"A\\" Battery HAC and the Nottinghamshire Battery, RHA could not be moved as their teams of horses had been shot. After firing these guns to the last moment, they were abandoned. The gunners removed the breech-blocks and sights and did as much damage as was possible in a few minutes while the brigade withdrew slowly firing as it went, up the slopes of the range to a position to which the horses had already been taken. It may have been possible to concentrate on the hills above the guns and keep the attackers away from the guns for some hours but it could have cost the whole brigade.Gullett 1941 pp. 618‚Äì9 Meanwhile, the 11th Light Horse Regiment on the left of the line, managed to withdraw down the valley with \\"B\\" Battery, two light horse regiments were forced eastward deep into the foothills to make a difficult withdrawal through rocky gullies and over craggy spurs. =Red Hill attacked and captured= After the 4th Light Horse Brigade was pushed off the Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt track and forced to retire, a large number of German and Ottoman soldiers which had evidently worked south along the Jordan, suddenly appeared at 10:00 in the open to attack the two squadrons of the 1st and 11th Light Horse Regiments defending the height of Red Hill.Falls assumes these soldiers crossed by the Mafid Jozele pontoon bridge. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 376] The squadrons were quickly forced to withdraw to the broken ground south and south-east of the hill.Preston 1921 p. 161Wavell 1968 p. 187The squadrons are identified as part of 1st Light Horse Regiment. [Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 376] Only a narrow gap now remained for the 4th Light Horse Brigade to retreat southwards. =Retreat from Jisr ed Damieh= Immediately after the loss of Red Hill an attack along the whole line was made by Ottoman units rushing forward and shouting ‚ÄòAllah! Allah! Allah!‚Äô The 4th Light Horse Brigade was outnumbered by five to one and was gradually being forced back to the east against the hills, fighting desperately every step of the way. The right flank was driven back across the Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt track and German and Ottoman units entered the foothills north of the track and began to work round to the light horse brigade's rear. At the same time enemy units began to push southwards, between the left flank of the light horse brigade and the remnants of the Red Hill garrison. Two troops were sent to try and check this movement long enough to allow the right flank of the brigade to be withdrawn; brigade headquarters and every man of ‚ÄòB‚Äô Battery H.A.C. that could be spared joined this fight. The 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments formed into many little columns of led horses and began moving in single file along the side of the steep hills. Their movement soon turned into something of a race as the German and Ottoman attackers marched on the plain and the light horsemen lead their horses through the hills. These light horsemen arrived in time to reinforce the squadron of 11th Light Horse Regiment which had been driven to a position in the foothills almost due east of Red Hill, with their left extended towards the river. There a strong firing line was rapidly built up and the German and Ottoman advance checked. The casualties during the attack were one officer and one other rank killed, seven officers and 44 other ranks wounded and 48 other ranks missing. These were mainly wounded and personnel from the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance who remained with them.Gullett 1941 pp. 620‚Äì2 Some bearers of the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance managed to escape the trap in the ravine by galloping down the ravine towards the advancing line of German and Ottoman soldiers a few hundred yards away and then swinging left and south across the advancing enemy front. Their escape was judged to have been due to luck and the speed of their horses. \\"It is remarkable how one can come through a veritable rain of bullets without getting hit.\\"Warrant Officer Bill Inglis 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance in Hamilton p. 118 Nine guns, two wagons, 16 limbers, four ambulance wagons, a general service wagon and a number of water- carts and motor-cycles were also captured.Downes 1938 pp. 691‚Äì2 For a first hand description of the attack see Hamilton 1996 pp. 113‚Äì17 =Chaytor's group reinforce left flank= After hearing of the German and Ottoman attack on the flank guard in the Jordan Valley, Chauvel urged the 60th (London) Division to press their attack, but at 10:00 ordered the withdrawal from Shunet Nimrin of the New Zealand Mounted Brigade (less two regiments), some machine guns and some guns all of which had been supporting the 60th (London) Division's attack. These units, together with the Middlesex Yeomanry (8th Mounted Brigade) which had been in Corps reserve, were ordered to move north on the east bank of the Jordan River to reinforce the 4th Light Horse Brigade. The 4th Light Horse Brigade, one regiment of the 6th Mounted Brigade and one regiment of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was reinforced by the 1/1st Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) which was to move at a rate of per hour from Musallabeh to report at the exit from the bridgehead on the track towards Wadi Arseniyat (Wadi Abu Turra).Kinloch 2007 p. 285 The 17th Machine Gun Squadron and the Berkshire Battery of horse artillery were also sent along with the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment and two armoured cars to reinforce the northern flank guard in the Jordan Valley.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 378‚Äì9 To command these units, Chauvel placed the commander of the Anzac Mounted Division Major General Edward Chaytor, in command of the defence against the German and Ottoman attack in the Jordan Valley. Chaytor initially went forward in a car to assess the situation, eventually riding a horse to find Grant holding the line on a wadi due east of Red Hill (the Wady Ishkarara) with the 11th Light Horse Regiment while the 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments could be seen moving southwards leading their horses along the lower slopes of the hills. Chaytor decided the position was unfavourable and moved the line to just north of the Umm esh Shert track; this withdrawal was achieved without incident.See Gullett's Map 34. =Establishment of new line covering Umm esh Shert= Gullett Map 34 ‚Äì Position at nightfall 1 May 1918 When his right flank was turned Grant ordered a retirement and the 4th Light Horse Brigade was pushed slowly south. A new shorter defensive line protecting the northern flank of the attacking forces about Es Salt was established covering the Umm esh Shert track.Preston 1921 pp. 162, 164‚Äì5 The German and Ottoman advance was stopped about north of Um esh Shert and covering the only track still open from the Jordan Valley to the light horse and mounted brigades on the mountains at Es Salt. The line which extended eastwards towards Es Salt from the Jordan River along the Wadi el Retem and into the foothills, was held by two New Zealand regiments, two Yeomanry regiments and the 4th Light Horse Brigade.Preston 1921 p. 164-5Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 379 At about 14:00 the Middlesex Yeomanry came up on the left and took up a line north of the Umm esh Shert track in the plain which was continued by the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment to the bank of the Jordan River. The line was covered by the Berkshire Battery and the 17th Machine Gun Squadron when they arrived. At 14:45 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment and the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery [LAMB], were withdrawn from the 60th (London) Division's infantry still fighting the Ottoman garrison at Shunet Nimrin, to reinforce Chaytor's force. The Ottoman 24th Infantry Division launched three unsuccessful attacks against the line which was quickly established by Chaytor's force. This line was anchored on high ground at Table Top and Black Hill and although Table Top was lost the new line was held and the vital Umm esh Shert track to Es Salt remained open. The 1st Light Horse Brigade, which had been holding a line astride the Umm esh Shert track close to Es Salt, was ordered to help protect the Umm esh Shert track from all directions and moved down to find touch in the hills with the 4th Light Horse Brigade late in the afternoon touch.Preston 1921 pp. 164‚Äì5, 159‚Äì60For a first hand description of the fighting to stop the enemy advance by R. W. Gregson 4th Light Horse Regiment regimental no. 2663, see letter published in Holloway pp. 211‚Äì2. The \\"Mac\\" referred to was Signaller Sergeant McHugh 4th Light Horse Regiment regimental no. 2664. He was awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal for maintaining \\"perfect communication\\" between his regimental headquarters and all three squadrons of his regiment throughout the period 30 April to 4 May 1918. The Australian Mounted Division's 2nd and 3rd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades at Es Salt now had one track back to the Jordan Valley.Downes 1938 pp. 692‚Äì3 The Umm esh Shert track was very rough and precipitous but this vital path was firmly held by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 4th Light Horse Brigades and a regiment of the 6th Mounted Brigade along the line of the Wady er Ratem from the Jordan Valley into the hills and by the 1st Light Horse Brigade in the hills. Its loss could have led to the capture of two brigades of the Australian Mounted Division and one brigade of the Anzac Mounted Division; the equivalent of an entire mounted division. =Air support= Australian airmen of No. 1 Squadron monitored the advance on Es Salt had reported the enemy threat from the north-west of Jisr ed Damieh and a raid by No. 142 Squadron of Bristol fighter aircraft dropped bombs on Jisr ed Damieh and fired 700 rounds into the scattering cavalry. Guns were seen coming into action at Jisr ed Damieh against the light horse beyond the river and in the evening at least 800 cavalry and 400 infantry were reported on the road to Es Salt south-east of Jisr ed Damieh. Two aircraft sent to drop leaflets on the Beni Sakhr were destroyed in strong winds over the Amman area and their pilots captured.Cutlack 1941 pp. 115‚Äì6 =Medical support= On 1 May the Australian Mounted Division collecting station was withdrawn to the Wady Abu Muhair at the junction with the main road, under the orders of the A.D.M.S., Anzac Mounted Division. During the day the Anzac Mounted Division receiving station admitted 372 more cases, all of whom were evacuated by evening.Downes 1938 p. 692 German and Ottoman advance on Es Salt The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was covering Es Salt from the east about half a mile from the town while the 2nd Light Horse Brigade which had just arrived moved on the Ain Hummar crossroads to support two squadrons of the 10th Light Horse Regiment, two guns of the Hong Kong Battery followed and the enemy position withdrew as a result. The light horse withdrew during the night; a detachment from 3rd Light Horse Brigade returning to its brigade to defend the town while the 2nd Light Horse moved to get in touch with the 5th Mounted Brigade and assist in the attack on the rear of the Shunet Nimrin El Haud position at Huweij Bridge.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 380 During the day the Ottoman 3rd Cavalry Division and infantry in the 2nd Regiment (24th Division) marched along the Jisr ed Damieh track towards Es Salt from the north-west. And in the evening at least 800 cavalry and 400 infantry were reported by reconnaissance aircraft on the road to Es Salt south-east of Jisr ed Damieh. It was not until 16:40 that Major General Sir Henry W. Hodgson (commander of Australian Mounted Division) at his headquarters in Es Salt learned of the loss of the Jisr ed Damieh road and that an enemy force was moving along that road towards Es Salt. He rushed two troops, the only reserves at Es Salt to the north-western side of the town to face this threat. German and Ottoman forces amply supported by field artillery and machine guns were moving to converge on Es Salt; reinforcements travelled quickly from the north and south of the Ottoman Empire on the Hejaz railway to Amman (as they had done during the first Transjordan attack in March).Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 330‚Äì1 Here they left their troop trains to march on Es Salt from the east while reinforcements from Nablus and Beisan marched across the Jisr ed Damieh bridge. The 2nd and 3rd Light Horse and the 5th Mounted Brigades in the vicinity of Es Salt together with the Australian Mounted Division's headquarters were completely reliant on a single line of communication from the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead in the Jordan Valley; all their communications and supplies had to travel the Umm esh Shert track. Ammunition and food were running short, and as no vehicles could get up the track, fresh supplies had to be sent up to Es Salt during the night of 1/2 May on about 200 donkeys. They were collected at Ghoraniyeh bridgehead in the evening, loaded with ammunition and stores and sent off in charge of a subaltern of the gunners. They reached Es Salt in the morning, delivered their supplies to Es Salt on the plateau and returned safely to Ghoraniyeh; a distance of through appallingly rugged and precipitous country.Preston 1921 p.166 Alleyby reporting the day's operations Yeomanry advance towards El Howeij bridge and rear of Shunet Nimrin Yeomanry in Es Salt While the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades were deployed in defensive positions around Es Salt and protecting the line of communication to the Jordan Valley, Hodgson ordered the 5th Mounted Brigade (commanded by Brigadier General P. J. V. Kelly) to move through Es Salt and down the main road to Jericho, towards Shunet Nimrin. The mounted brigade was to attack the rear of this strong position held by the Ottoman VIII Corps, while the 60th (London) Division continued their frontal attack from below in the Jordan Valley.Keogh 1955 pp. 223‚Äì4 The 1st Light Horse Brigade had taken up a position at the junction of the Umm esh Shert and the Abu Turra tracks, the latter of which was covered by the Ottoman forces defending the rear of Shunet Nimrin.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 379-80 Shortly afterwards the 1st Light Horse Brigade was sent to attack Shunet Nimrin from the rear, but a little further to the north down the Abu Turra track, while the 3rd Light Horse Brigade remained covering the town of Es Salt. At 08:40 the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars reported they were within of the El Howeij bridge but that further progress was impossible. The remainder of the 5th Mounted Brigade arrived to support the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars about south of Es Salt where it encountered a unit of Ottoman soldiers entrenched on a cliff. The brigade commander considered the position too strong to attack but he was confident the Ottoman defenders would attempt to recover some guns he had captured. In order to be ready for an attack, he took up a defensive position astride the road even though he was aware that infantry from the 60th (London) Division, attacking Shunet Nimrin from the Jordan Valley, was having some success. At 11:00 Kelly was ordered by Hodgson to attack vigorously down the road towards Shunet Nimrin and the rear of the Ottoman position. At 15:00 Kelly rode back to meet with Hodgson; when he described the strength of the Ottoman position defending El Howeij bridge, Hodgson decided to postpone the attack until dawn the following day when the 2nd Light Horse Brigade would join the attack. 2 May Gullett Map 35 ‚Äì Position on 2 May 1918 Chauvel's force fought desperately for success; an attempt by 1st Light Horse very nearly succeeded in turning the Shunet Nimrin flank, but the VIIIth Corps was too strong, continuing to hold off the infantry attacks from the Jordan Valley, while the yeomanry mounted brigade held its position in the hills between Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt. The position of the light horse brigades at Es Salt was being seriously threatened on the east by reinforcements from Amman and from the north and northwest from Jisr ed Damieh.Wavell 1968 pp. 187‚Äì8 The German and Ottoman reinforcements which had advanced from Beisan and Nablus over the Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh began strongly attacking the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Es Salt from the north and northwest. Later in the day Es Salt was also attacked from the east by another German and Ottoman force which had advanced from Amman forcing two regiments of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to be withdrawn from the 5th Mounted Brigade's attack on the rear of Shunet Nimrin. By 17:30 the general situation of Hodgson's force in the hills was as follows: * the 5th Mounted Brigade was north of Huweij Bridge * the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was engaged east of Es Salt against 400 infantry, 200 cavalry and four heavy guns advancing from Suweile * the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was northwest of Es Salt with a regiment covering the Jisr ed Damieh track as it approached Es Salt * the 1st Light Horse Brigade (less the 1st Light Horse Regiment which was moving to reinforce the 2nd Light Horse Brigade) had its right west of Es Salt and its left in touch with the troops commanded by Chaytor protecting the line of communication; the Umm esh Shert track to the Jordan Valley.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 383 By the evening the attack by the mounted troops on the rear of Shunet Nimrin had definitely failed and Es Salt was being attacked from the southeast, from the north and from the northwest. While the attack on Es Salt from Amman was held, the force approaching Es Salt from the Jisr ed Damieh was pushing strongly and vigorously against the light horse defenders; one attack at 20:00 got to within of the right of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade ‚Äì fighting continued intermittently throughout the night. A convoy of ammunition and medical supplies, marching through the night, succeeded in reaching Es Salt in the morning, but the corridor of supply and retreat to the Jordan Valley was very narrow; being kept open only by hard fighting. The three days' rations, which each man had carried with him when the attack began, had now run out, but there was no shortage of water and good grazing for the horses as well as grain, and for the men raisins and fresh meat were requisitioned in Es Salt. Chaytor's force defends Umm esh Shert track Chaytor's force, which was defending the left flank and the Umm esh Shert line of communication with Es Salt, was being attacked by increasingly strong Ottoman forces. Two troops of the 11th Light Horse Regiment and one troop of the 4th Light Light Horse Regiment held an advanced position on a small flat-topped hill known as \\"Table Top\\" on the right, in front of Chaytor's main line of defence. This outpost was attacked from both flanks at 15:45 by German and Ottoman soldiers of the Assault Battalion of the 24th Division and Companies (these may have been the 146th Regiment, 3/32nd, 1/58th, 1/150th Battalions). After repulsing the attackers twice with the bayonet the light horsemen were forced to withdraw losing access to a good spring but the loss of Table Top did not compromise the integrity the Umm esh Shert line.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 383‚Äì4, 393 Light horse join yeomanry in attack on El Howeij bridge The 2nd Light Horse Brigade had joined the 5th Mounted Brigade at the rear of the German and Ottoman positions at El Haud and Shunet Nimrin, but both commanders considered they had little or no hope of reaching their objectives before dark.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 382 However, by 07:00 the attack on Es Salt from the east had become so threatening that Hodgson telephoned Chauvel asking if the 5th Mounted and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades could be moved to defend Es Salt.Preston 1921 pp.168‚Äì70 At 11:30 Hodgson informed the 2nd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades of the seriousness of the attacks on Es Salt and ordered one regiment of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to be sent to reinforce the town. In the early afternoon, after a telephone conversation with Hodgson, Chauvel ordered the attempt to reach the rear of the Shunet Nimrin position to be continued. Success here would resolve all difficulties and Chauvel insisted that the attack by the 2nd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades on the rear of Shunet Nimrin must be continued.Woodward 2006 pp. 177‚Äì8 At the time Chauvel had refused Hodgson's request for the two brigades attacking the rear of Shunet Nimrin to reinforce Es Salt, he agreed that a second regiment of 2nd Light Horse Brigade be withdrawn to defend Es Salt against growing German and Ottoman attacks. Despite having redeployed two regiments of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to defend Es Salt, Hodgson had also not lost sign of the importance of winning the attack on the rear of the Shunet Nimrin position and planned to move the regiments back to assist the 5th Mounted Brigade next morning. The 5th Mounted Brigade was left with three regiments to carry out an operation which its commander had thought impossible with five. Nevertheless, two regiments, the Worcester Yeomanry and Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, moved in single file down the wadi east of but parallel to the Es Salt road, finding progress impossible they withdrew slightly and climbed up on the east bank south of the Abu Turra.This was probably the Wadi Nimrin/Shaib; the Wadi Abu Turra was some considerable distance to the north of the Howeij position. [Gullett's Map 35 ‚Äì Positions on 2 May] Here they came under heavy artillery fire and the commander of the Worcester Yeomanry decided to break off the attack on his own initiative as he considered the German and Ottoman position too strong.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 382‚Äì3 Further at 16:30 the commander of yeomanry in the 5th Mounted Brigade, reported Ottoman cavalry at El Fuheis south of Es Salt threatening his left flank and rear. Hodgson had no troops to spare for defence on the south side and ordered him to protect his flank and rear with two squadrons of the 6th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) and to put in his reserve regiment in one last attack on El Howeij. The mounted yeomanry tried very hard to force their way towards Shunet Nimrin, but the configuration of the ground continually forced them into defiles swept by machine gun fire and across open ridges where well placed artillery exacted its toll. Their advance was finally halted well short of its objective. The commander of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had agreed with Kelly \\"that to attack down the Es Salt road was doomed to failure\\" and on Kelly's request reported \\"the ground is impossible and the position impregnable\\" but Hodgson refused to cancel his order.Kelly's 1928 recollection in Woodward 2006 pp. 177‚Äì8 This attack represented the only chance of driving in the German and Ottoman flank at El Howeij and El Haud from the east while the attack on El Haud and Shunet Nimrin by infantry in the 60th (London) Division continued from the west. Worn out by three days and nights of continuous marching and fighting, reduced by casualties, and with no support to give their attack depth, they could not reach the rear of the enemy position and the attack failed. The brigade re- formed, and took up a position on the north side of the wadi, facing the German and Ottoman force. Kelly had failed to follow the orders of his two superior officers, making the point that neither Hodgson nor Chauvel or any of their staff had inspected the ground over which his men were ordered to advance and push in his reserves \\"to the last man.\\" Kelly believed that \\"it would have been nothing short of criminal to have pushed in a very weak reserve where twice their numbers had failed\\" and that \\"the attack had inflicted no casualties whatsoever on the enemy.\\" Kelly's 1928 recollection in Woodward 2006 p. 179Kelly was removed from his command by Allenby five months later because he failed to push his advantage and capture Nazareth.[Woodward 2006 p. 179] Meanwhile, Chauvel refused to abandon the attack on the rear of the Shunet Nimrin position. An attack by his light horse was almost successful; by moving along an unexpected route the 1st Light Horse Regiment very nearly made contact with the infantry left of the 60th (London) Division, which again attacked strongly during the night. But the Ottoman VIII Corps continued to present a strong front while their Austrian gunners, having fired away all their ammunition took their rifles and joined the detachment protecting the rear of El Haud and Shunet Nimrin.Keogh 1955 pp. 224‚Äì5 Infantry attacks on El Haud and Shunet Nimrin continue Infantry from the 60th (London) Division continued to pressure the German and Ottoman position at Shunet Nimrin from the west while reinforcements were continuing to reach the enemy force at Shunet Nimrin via the Ain es Sir road. Shea the commander of the 60th (London) Division concluded that there was little chance of progress until El Haud was captured and planned to launch a night attack by the 179th Brigade; the 2/13th and 2/16th Battalions, London Regiment, protecting its right and two companies of the Patiala infantry on the left. The 2/18th Battalion, London Regiment (180th Brigade) was to send strong patrols along the Tell Buleibil spur towards El Haud and instead of support from 5th Mounted Brigade, the 1st Light Horse Brigade was to send a detachment from its junction with the Umm esh Shert track, down the Wadi Abu Turra track to attack El Haud from the north. At the same time the remainder of Tooth's Detachment was to work up the Wadi Abu Turra to find touch with the 1st Light Horse Brigade's detachment moving down from the north east.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 384 A necessary prerequisite for this attack towards El Haud was the capture of Ma'qqer ed Derbasi. This proved impossible during the day and plans were made for a night attack; at 02:00 one and a half companies of the 2/17th Battalion, London Regiment simultaneously assaulted Ma'qqer ed Derbasi from both the north and the south. Although the northern detachment had some success it was strongly counter-attacked and compelled to withdraw while the southern group was held up and then attacked on the flank losing 20 men captured during the retirement. Although these preliminary attacks were unsuccessful and compromised the main attack, the main attack still went ahead. Tooth's Detachment consisting of one squadron 6th Light Horse Regiment, two companies Patiala Infantry and the 16th Mountain Battery, had early successes in their advance up the Wadi Abu Turra to attack El Haud. But the advances by the 2/15th and the 2/18th Battalions, London Regiment were soon stopped by German and Ottoman defenders at Ma'qqer ed Derbasi, although there were considerable successes on the left of infantry in the 17th Brigade. At 02:00 the 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment made an advance of nearly to establish its flank well to the north of El Haud while the Patiala infantry advanced from the Wadi Abu Turra to reach a hill north west of El Haud, very nearly succeeding in turning the German and Ottoman position. Heavy machine gun fire on exposed infantry ended the attempt.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 381 Daylight caught the 2/13th Battalion, London Regiment in an exposed position; forced to lie flat on the summit under heavy machine gun fire during the day, they withdrew that night. Meanwhile, a squadron of 1st Light Horse Brigade moved down the Abu Turra track to a point about north of El Haud at 06:00 but was compelled to retire soon after.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 384‚Äì5 The frontal and rear attacks on El Haud and Shunet Nimrin had only narrowly failed, but during the day while the battle continued, the German and Ottoman force had been greatly reinforced and it became clear that the operations could not succeed.Preston 1921 pp. 170‚Äì2 German and Ottoman attacks on Es Salt Early in the morning of 2 May the 3rd Cavalry Division and Ottoman infantry in the 2nd Regiment (24th Division) formed a column which advanced up the road from Jisr ed Damieh, after the 4th Light Horse Brigade was forced to withdraw on 1 May. This Ottoman force made a strong attack on the positions held by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and became heavily engaged on a line north-west and north of Es Salt. At this time Hodgson ordered two troops to move around to the north-western side of the town to stop these attackers.Preston 1921 pp. 167, 169‚Äì70 At 11:00 a regiment from the 1st Light Horse Brigade was dispatched to reinforce the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and 30 minutes later a second regiment was withdrawn from the 1st Light Horse Brigade for the same purpose. At this critical time, the donkey convoy carrying 100,000 rounds of small arms ammunition and about 300 rounds for the mountain batteries arrived.Preston 1921 p.167 During the early morning pressure from Arabs, Circassians and Ottoman reinforcements from Amman also developed on the eastern side of Es Salt.Downes suggests this attack from the east on Es Salt only developed later in the day. [Downes 1938 p. 692] Two regiments of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and one of the 1st Light Horse Brigade moved to defend Es Salt on the north-east and east against German and Ottoman forces attacking from the direction of Amman. One regiment of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade which had been attacking the rear of Shunet Nimrin was ordered to move back to support the defence of Es Salt and shortly after a second regiment was withdrawn for the same purpose. By 14:30 the battle for Es Salt had become so serious on the eastern side of the town that the 1st Light Horse Brigade was ordered to send another regiment at once to join the two regiments of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Es Salt.Preston 1921 pp.169‚Äì70Preston places the remaining regiment of the 1st Light Horse Brigade in divisional reserve in the town before being sent as reinforcement. [Preston 1921 pp.169‚Äì70] Although Hodgson was forced to recall the 1st Light Horse Brigade, he ordered it to leave the 1st Light Horse Regiment to continue working south towards the rear of Shunet Nimrin. No. 1 Squadron AFC flew a series of reconnaissance missions over the Es Salt area. At 06:00 a German two-seater was sighted at about between Jericho and Jisr ed Damieh and was successfully attacked by an Australian Bristol Fighter aircraft. At 06:30 a large enemy cavalry forces about Ain es Sir southeast of Es Salt was sighted. By 12:00 enemy reinforcements and ammunition were seen being transported from Nablus to Mejdel Beni Fadl, and the lower Wady Fara road from Nablus to Jisr ed Damieh was full of transport, cavalry and guns, while on the Jisr ed Damieh to Es Salt section of the same road enemy cavalry was seen advancing towards Es Salt.Cutlack 1941 pp. 116‚Äì7 3 May During the night the third infantry brigade of the 60th (London) Division; the 181st Brigade, which had been in reserve on the XX Corps front, was ordered to move to the Jordan Valley from Ram Allah. The infantry brigade had arrived at Bethany at midnight, travelling in motor lorries from Jerusalem to the Jordan Valley; they arrived during the morning and concentrated in the Wadi Nimrin east of Ghoraniyeh but they were too late to affect the outcome of the battle.Downes 1938 p. 693Hill 1978 pp. 149‚Äì50Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 385When infantry from the 181st Brigade 60th (London) (2/6th London) Division moved from Jerusalem to the Jordan Valley during the night of 2 May, its field ambulance could not bring its transport, so the transport of the 6th Mounted Field Ambulance, which had not so far been engaged, was attached to it. [Downes 1938 p. 694] Chauvel was inclined to renew the attacks on El Haud and Shunet Nimrin as he thought the Abu Turra track would be required for the retirement from Es Salt but Hodgson had decided to rely entirely on the Umm esh Shert track and infantry in the 60th (London) Division was ordered to keep the German and Ottoman force occupied during the afternoon by sudden bursts of artillery fire and feint attacks. During the day the R. A. F. dropped of bombs on Amman reporting a direct hit on the railway station. Chaytor's force continues defence of Umm esh Shert track At 04:00 a German and Ottoman bombing assault [possibly stick bombs thrown by hand] on Black Hill on the right of the line held by Chaytor's force got to within of the 4th Light Horse Brigade's position. They were eventually forced to withdraw, leaving a machine gun; a second attack at dusk also failed. The defenders on Black Hill knew Hodgson's force at Es Salt depended on the Umm esh Shert track and were prepared to fight to the last man.Falls 1930 Vol 2 p. 386 By the evening of 3 May the German and Ottoman forces in the Jordan Valley, which had been unable to break Chaytor's force holding the Umm esh Shert track, began to withdraw to the north to reinforce the attacks on Es Salt.Preston 1921 pp.173‚Äì5 Meanwhile, the Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry moved to the east bank of the Jordan River and became the reserve of the 6th Mounted Brigade. =Medical support= Wounded kept arriving at 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance during a very hot Friday 3 May; their wounds were dressed in the open before sending the men straight on. The ambulance was up nearly all night evacuating patients; four ambulance loads were sent off in 5th Mounted Brigade ambulances.Hamilton 1996 p. 117 Decision to withdraw Some of the 50 Ottoman/German officers taken prisoner during the Second Transjordan operations The British garrison at Es Salt was being attacked virtually from all sides when Allenby and Chauvel met on the afternoon of 3 May. At 15:00 Allenby flew to meet with Chauvel at his battle HQ west of the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead. He knew the state of battle; he had seen for himself from his aircraft the strength of the German and Ottoman troops being held by Chaytor's force.Bruce 2002 pp. 201‚Äì2Hill 1978 p. 150 The strong attack on the light horse at Jisr ed Damieh could have been managed if Shunet Nimrin had fallen. Instead the frontage of the attack had been considerably widened and the initiative had passed firmly into German and Ottoman hands. The brigades in the hills were living off the land but running short of ammunition, and reconnaissance aircraft sighted a large concentration of German and Ottoman reinforcements at Amman. On top of the threat to his lines of communication, Hodgson, the commander of the Australian Mounted Division at Es Salt, was now being seriously pressed by attacks on the town. The two great threats to the lines of communication along the Umm esh Shert track and to Es Salt, eventually compelled the abandonment of the operations when the main objective of the second Transjordan operations, to surround and capture the garrison at Shunet Nimrin, could not succeed. Further the threat of encirclement and capture of Hodgson's force meant there was little to be gained and a great deal to lose from further fighting. Allenby could only acknowledge the facts; therefore he told Chauvel to issue orders for a general withdrawal. The orders went out at 16:00.Hughes 1999 p. 87 German and Ottoman attacks on Es Salt held All day long the German and Ottoman attackers closed in on Es Salt from the east, north and north-west. Australian aircraft on reconnaissance just after dawn on 3 May found that enemy camps at Wady Fara and Jisr ed Damieh had increased overnight, and units were seen crossing at Jisr ed Damieh by a punt.Cutlack 1941 p. 119 A fresh column of German and Ottoman reinforcements consisting of the 2nd Regiment (24th Division under the command of 3rd Cavalry Division), which had crossed the Jordan River at Mafid Jozele on the night of 30 April but had been sent back to recross at Jisr ed Damieh, worked up to within of the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) at Kefr Huda. Although the 2nd Regiment successfully attacked this post covering the road from Jisr ed Damieh, this post was not of great tactical importance as the road was covered by other posts. Although the 10th Light Horse Regiment was strongly attacked, the enemy were unable to continue their advance after gaining Kefr Huda. During the day the 5th Mounted Brigade was ordered to send a regiment into reserve south east of the town. At dawn on the Amman side of Es Salt the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the outskirts of town covering the road from Amman came to close quarters with German and Ottoman attackers. They had closed in on the position held by two squadrons of the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade temporarily attached to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade) which had been sent to support the 2nd Light Horse Brigade near where the Amman road turns sharply southwards into the town. The situation was cleared by Major Shannon, commanding the 8th Light Horse Regiment, when he dispatched a troop of 25 men to work round the German and Ottoman right flank, if possible unseen by the enemy, and charge them from the rear. They made a desperate bayonet charge, crashing into the enemy just as they were massing for an assault, killing more than a hundred. The sudden and unexpected attack from behind so disconcerted the Germans and Ottomans that they became disorganised, while at the same time the remainder of the 8th Light Horse Regiment made a frontal attack which resulted in the enemy soldiers being driven back more than . On the right of the 8th Light Horse Regiment, the firing line had been commanded in enfilade by the 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade). This desperate expedient successfully broke up the attacks from the east and relieved pressure on the north side of Es Salt; 319 Ottoman soldiers were captured.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 385‚Äì6 Soon after midday a regiment of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, still far below strength (some troops had only 20 men), took over part of the line where the full force of the enemy attack had been directed that morning. The post overlooked a deep gorge which in places was sheer, running almost to the road. Beyond the gorge another light horse regiment was holding the flank; the troop got in touch with the post on their right before dark and it was estimated that they were responsible for roughly of the outpost line, with orders not to withdraw until definite word from headquarters. The 20 men were split into six listening posts with instructions to retire to a little knob overlooking the road in case of a serious attack.Berrie 1949 p. 198 From the post at the edge of the gorge a narrow track led down to a broad ledge with a deep drop below where the rearguard stumbled on another group who had been left behind. \\"At about 22:00 whispering could be heard coming from the ledge, so a stone was bowled over. They were Australians who got a shock when they found that their squadron had retired nearly an hour before and quickly left.\\" From 21:00 the left flank was completely unprotected after the regiment posted there pulled out. Had the enemy known, they could have walked quietly round and down the road to the horses. After several more quiet hours, at 02:00 orders came to fall back on the horses and with scarcely a halt rode steadily back to the Jordan Valley.Berrie 1949 p. 199 Evacuation of the wounded By the afternoon of 3 May only 42 minor casualties had been evacuated on horseback from the Greek church in Es Salt, where an advanced dressing station had been established. Only 29 camels and the riderless horses remained for the wounded. By 18:00 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance had left with all the wounded their camels could carry, leaving the seriously wounded and the medical personnel caring for them to await capture. After a great deal of equipment was abandoned, all but two mortally wounded men were finally mounted on to the camel cacolets of the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance and under heavy but wild rifle fire from the townspeople of Es Salt, left at 19:30 on a perilous descent of the Umm esh Shert track. Some of the wounded had been waiting for three days to leave Es Salt. Every man who could possibly cling to or tie himself on to a horse's saddle, did so in preference to trusting himself to the dreadful camel cacolets. What the wounded men in the cacolets must have suffered during this terrible journey can scarcely be imagined.Downes 1938 pp. 694‚Äì5Keogh 1955 p. 225 Egyptian Camel Transport Corps not required by the fighting troops accompanied the evacuation of the wounded down the Umm Esh Shert track, preparatory to the withdrawal of the whole force. Camels, slow and sometimes obstinate beasts, made barely an hour moving in single file down the precipitous goat path of Umm esh Shert. Their feet, more suited to sand, were cut and bruised by the sharp stones and slippery rocks of the path. Groaning and protesting, the unwieldy beasts lurched perilously down the track. Every now and then one of them would stop short, blocking the way for those behind it and refuse obstinately to move on. It was past mid-day before the last camel had cleared Es Salt They travelled through the bitterly cold night, closely followed by the personnel of the advanced dressing station. One camel fell over a cliff and was killed, but its two patients were rescued. The camels loaded with the wounded in cacolets were led over places which would have been thought impassable but towards morning they showed signs of exhaustion and it was only with the greatest difficulty that they were encouraged forward. The convoy arrived at the Australian Mounted Division collecting station on the Wady Abu Muhair where the wounded were fed before being taken by ambulance wagons to the Anzac Mounted Division receiving station at Ghoraniyeh. The Australian Mounted Division's divisional collecting station was situated east of the Jordan on the Umm esh Shert to Es Salt track. Motor ambulance wagons of the 1st Mounted (later 4th Cavalry) Division (which was not ready to take the field) were used to transport wounded to the main dressing-station after being processed through the divisional receiving station near Ghorniyeh. Two hours after leaving Ghoraniyeh, casualties reached the main dressing station, in motor ambulance wagons supplied by the 1st (British) Mounted Division and the XX Corps. Here, three operating teams performed surgery, including 78 major operations, before the wounded were sent on to the casualty clearing station at Jerusalem. The trip from the Corps' main dressing station to Jerusalem took seven hours in 28 heavy and 10 Ford motor ambulance wagons. Army Service Corps motor lorries returning to Jerusalem were also employed.Downes 1938 pp. 690‚Äì1, 695 Wounded were still coming in steadily to the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance on Saturday 4 May, when German and Ottoman guns shelled the area round a cliff where the Field Ambulance had set up a dressing station. Two men on horses were caught by the shelling; their wounds were dressed and the dressing station shifted further up the gully. At dusk word came for all troops to retreat. Some wounded were still out in the field on slow moving cacolet camels and 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance personnel went out about to meet them, and found six wounded being loaded onto transport wagons, as no ambulances were available.Hamilton recalled: Then got word of another wounded man still out in the field. I went forward again a short way, lit a lamp and dressed a wound in his face. I gave him a hypodermic shot of morphia, got him on a camel and hurried back. He was Trooper Good of the 4th Light Horse Regiment. A sand cart from the 1st Light Horse Field Ambulance caught us up. I transferred Good from the slow-moving camel to the sand cart and finally got him to the Anzac Mounted Division Receiving Station near the bridgehead and watched him operated on. His left eye was taken out. [Hamilton 1996 pp.117‚Äì8] Retreat on 4‚Äì5 May Withdrawal from Es Salt In preparation for the retreat, two sections of the 519th Field Company Royal Engineers from the infantry division; the 60th (London) Division, were sent the night before to improve the Umm esh Shert track.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 388 Then during the night of 3/4 May, Hodgson's force withdrew from Es Salt down the Umm esh Shert track and by the evening of 4 May the whole force had passed through the bridgehead at Ghoraniyeh, recrossed the Jordan and returned to their lines west of the river.Hughes dates the return to the Jordan Valley as 3 May. [Hughes 1999 p. 87] Return from Es Salt ‚Äì units making their way down the track in the background and crossing the middle pontoon bridge over the Jordan at El Auja bridgehead Once the order to withdraw was given, the first priority was to hold the large bridgehead from Makhadet Hajlah to the line now held by infantry from the 60th (London) Division in front of Shunet Nimrin, and on to the Umm esh Shert until the withdrawal from Es Salt was completed.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 386‚Äì7 At 17:15 Hodgson ordered the withdrawal of his force. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade covered the first stage of the withdrawal to a rearguard position south-west of Es Salt, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade took up a position across the Umm esh Shert track south-west of Es Salt, and facing east piqueting the heights covering the Umm esh Shert track all the way down from the rearguard position to the Jordan Valley.Falls 1930 Vol. 2, p. 387 Two hours after the last wounded and camels left, a force of 3,000 German and Ottoman infantry attacked the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Es Salt. As the wounded were now well on their way down to the valley, Chauvel, the commander of Desert Mounted Corps, ordered Hodgson to withdraw to a position south-west of Es Salt covering the Umm esh Shert track. As they fell back, the 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades left small groups on the tracks north and east of Es Salt to keep up intermittent firing until dawn. After dark, the remainder of the force withdrew through this line regiment by regiment and marched down the track during the night. The evacuation of Es Salt was completed by 02:30, but as they could only move in single file, the regiments and brigades were strung out for many miles along the track. In the dark, movement down the mountainous Umm esh Shert track was exhausting for the long column of fighting men, wounded and refugees. The column was still making its way down to the Jordan Valley at daybreak.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 387‚Äì88 The 5th Mounted Brigade, in particular, had great difficulty moving by a terrible path; their retirement had begun at 20:30 but they did not reach Jebel Umm 'Awiya until 03:45, when the brigade came under the command of Brigadier General Cox (1st Light Horse Brigade). Rearguards After the evacuation of Es Salt was complete the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to withdraw all but the fighting troops of one regiment from its rearguard position. Australian Mounted Divisional headquarters moved to the junction of the Umm esh Shert and Abu Turra tracks where Hodgson reported at 06:10 that all camels, pack animals and prisoners had passed down the track. A column of donkeys with ammunition and biscuits which had recently arrived, joined the retreat, dumping their biscuits at the roadside for the troops to help themselves before turning back to join the withdrawal. At daylight German and Ottoman forces pushed through Es Salt to attack and press the 1st Light Horse Brigade rearguard until it was from Es Salt. At the same time enemy guns heavily shelled the light horse rearguard and several German and Ottoman aircraft caused a number of casualties when they bombed the retiring columns as they moved down the narrow, steep-sided gorge. The light horse rearguard was about halfway between Es Salt and Umm esh Shert at dawn, when all the British Empire reconnaissance aircraft were sent off carrying four 20-lb. bombs. Defence of bridgeheads By 10:30 on 4 May the mounted brigades were all clear of the hills and moving in extended order down the Jordan Valley towards the Ghoraniyeh crossing, covered by Chaytor's force of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, two regiments from the 6th and one from the 8th Mounted Brigades and part of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade with the 17th Machine Gun Squadron and the Berkshire Battery and two armoured cars. This force had been in action almost continuously, since they had taken up their position covering the Umm esh Shert track on 1 May, repelling all attacks. The rearguard of Hodgson's column was closely followed by German and Ottoman units firing on the rear of the retreating column. When they reached the Jordan Valley, the right rear of Chaytor's force was threatened by enemy units which pressed in strongly on the piquets in the hills which were soon driven in, while German aircraft continued to machine gun the column. Five Taubes came over and for half an hour bombed the large formations and about midday German and Ottoman forces closed in on the right as our troops withdrew under heavy fire. The 4th Light Horse Brigade was being strongly pushed as it fell back following orders to retire. During this crucial part of the retirement, the 4th Light Horse Brigade's right had become uncovered but when the formations got to the lower slopes of the hills the dismounted Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment reinforced the 4th Light Horse Brigade's right. A squadron of Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) with the Berkshire, Leicester Batteries and the remaining three guns of \\"B\\" Battery H. A. C. came into action against this German and Ottoman force advancing down the Umm esh Shert track.Powles 1922 p. 222 These squadrons and artillery came into action and checked the strong enemy attack with the support of the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) which had also been sent back to support the rearguard. The 1st and 3rd Light Horse Brigades and the 10th Mountain Battery formed a reserve while the 2nd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades proceeded straight on through to the bridgehead.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 p. 389 Attacks continued trying to work round the right flank of Chaytor's force in the Jordan Valley throughout the day, but were firmly held while Grant, beginning at 18:45, withdrew his troops by units from the left in good order. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade withdrew across the Jordan River, reaching their bivouac by 04:00 on 5 May; they had left the Wellington and Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiments temporarily at the bridgehead. Infantry retirement Shortly the 60th (London) Division broke off its fight at Shunet Nimrin and withdrew across the Jordan River leaving one infantry brigade in the bridgehead at Ghoraniyeh. As they were withdrawing, two Ottoman or German aircraft attacked the 60th (London) Division west of Shunet Nimrin; they were both shot down by the infantry. The dead infantrymen from the 60th (London) Division were removed in wagons for burial; it is not known what happened to the bodies of Australian light horsemen, British mounted yeomanry and New Zealand riflemen who died while fighting around Es Salt and in the Jordan Valley. The 179th and 180th Brigades were moved west of the Jordan River while the 181st Brigade held the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead. Allenby decided to maintain the original bridgehead at Ghoraniyeh and to create a second one at El Auja where a bridge was to be thrown across. Chaytor sent a regiment for the defence of the El Auja crossing under the orders of Brigadier General Smith commanding the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade while engineers began work on the defences at El Auja. All troops not required to hold these bridgeheads were withdrawn west of the river. Bridgeheads re-established By the evening Chaytor's force had retired and the battle ceased. The whole of Chauvel's force had withdrawn behind infantry from the 181st Brigade of the 60th (London) Division which had been brought across the Jordan from the west bank to form an extended bridgehead at Ghoraniyeh. During the night the last of Hodgson's force recrossed the river, and all were safely on the west bank before the morning of 5 May.Preston 1921 p.175 Chauvel's force withdrew west of the Jordan River, retaining bridgeheads on the eastern bank. The original bridgeheads at Ghoraniyeh and at Makhadet Hajlah to the south were re-established and an additional bridgehead was established at the el Auja ford to the north of Ghoraniyeh. The Australian Mounted Division took over the left sector of the Jordan Valley defences along the river el Auja, including the new bridge and bridgehead thrown across the Jordan at its junction with the el Auja, during the operations. The Anzac Mounted Division took over the right sector of the Jordan Valley defences, including the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead. Casualties The Anzac and Australian Mounted Divisions and the 60th (London) Division brought with them nearly 1,000 German and Ottoman prisoners at a cost of 1,649 British Empire casualties.Bruce 2002 p. 202Woodward 2006 p. 180 Of these 1,649 casualties (including 137 missing) 1,116 were suffered by the 60th (London) Division and the attached Patiala Infantry Battalion.Falls 1930 Vol. 2 pp. 389, 394 The total evacuations during these operations was 1,784 of whom 1,076 were wounded and 708 were sick. Only 310 of these casualties were from the light horse and mounted brigades; the infantry attack at Shunet Nimrin had been extremely costly.Downes 1938 pp. 691, 695 The Ottoman VIII Corps lost 831 casualties and its claimed half of the force which attacked the 4th Light Horse Brigade were casualties; giving a total of more than 2,000, while 44 German, 389 Ottoman and 39 Bedouin were captured. Aftermath In January 1918, Field Marshal Jan Smuts had conferred with Allenby, to determine the future direction of operations in Palestine. Between them, they had planned for the advance to Damascus and Aleppo to begin on 5 May. As part of the first phase of this advance Lawrence and Feisal's force was undertaking the siege of Ma'an, but due to the delay in the advance northwards German and Ottoman units from Amman were in a position to threaten Feisal's Hejaz Arabs from Aba el Lissan back to Aqaba, while Allenby was threatening German and Ottoman forces to the east of the Jordan River with the capture of Es Salt. Allenby offered technical equipment to strengthen the precarious position of Lawrence and Feisal's position on the plateau.Lawrence 1962 p. 540 With the break up of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade Allenby gave Feisal's force 2,200 riding-camels, and 1,300 transport camels.Lawrence 1962 p. 541 Chauvel held the opinion, that Allenby had already determined his plans for the Battle of Megiddo, before the Second Transjordan attack.Hill 1978 p. 161 Instead of the general advance to Damascus, Allenby attempted a similar operation to the First Transjordan with a force that had been strengthened by a factor of one third; by the addition of one mounted division, yet British GHQ estimates of the strength of enemy forces east of the Jordan River were about double what they had been at the time of the First Transjordan attack. The Second Transjordan revealed, not only the determination of the defending forces to cover the vital railway junction at Deraa, but difficulties for mounted units imposed by the rough terrain. Shea's force attacking Shunet Nimrin and Grant's and later Chaytor's force in the Jordan Valley as well as Hodgson's force in the hills around Es Salt all demonstrated strong cohesion and leadership in skilfully conducted operations against a determined enemy where less determination would have met with disaster.Pugsley 2004 pp. 142‚Äì3 During the First Transjordan attack in April 1918, when Allenby employed infantry from the 60th (London) Division, the Anzac Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade in an attack on Amman, the German, Austrian and Ottoman forces demonstrated they were still capable of winning battles. And during the five weeks between the first and second Transjordan operations they demonstrated a substantial measure of recovery at Tulkarem, offensive tendencies in the upper Jordan Valley, and had created a strong defensive position at Shunet Nimrin which withstood all attacks. This already formidable enemy force was further strengthened with reinforcements said to number twice that faced during the first Transjordan operations and had been put on the alert by the demonstration on 18 April. It is therefore hard to understand how Allenby concluded that Chauvel's force was strong enough to carry out its mission. Allenby may have thought German and Ottoman reinforcements would not, or could not in the time, transfer troops across the Jordan River; he may have thought that the better weather would enable his troops to move more rapidly which was indeed true, but German and Ottoman forces also benefited and it seems Allenby placed too much reliance on the Beni Sakhr.Keogh 1955 p. 226 Light horsemen watering their horses in the Jordan River on 4 May 1918 after their return from Es Salt The two Transjordan operations in 1918 have been widely referred to as 'raids' implying an eventual withdrawal. The first Transjordan operation to Amman was always referred to as a 'raid' but the second incursion to Es Salt had the term imposed on it. The intention of the second Transjordan had been to open up a large and ambitious new front and the operation was referred to by German General Liman von Sanders commanding the German and Ottoman armies as 'The Second Battle of the Jordan.'It was well understood that \\"wherever there is a numerous and highly organised body of mounted troops on either side, and when the country, comprising the theatre of war, is favourable, raids or invasions of mounted troops into the country occupied by the enemy will be one of the most important duties of the mounted services.\\" [Mounted Service Manual for Mounted Troops of the Australian Commonwealth (Government Printer Sydney 1902) p.339] Although the first and second Transjordan operations were a distinct tactical defeat, the losses were not too heavy; about 500 in the mounted divisions and 1,100 in the infantry and close on a 1,000 prisoners were captured. The strategic effect was nevertheless favourable due to the fact that from then on one third of the total German and Ottoman forces were stationed east of the Jordan.Wavell 1968 p. 188 These two operations had convinced the German and Ottoman high command that their left flank would be the main focus of British offensive activity and that Allenby would not advance on the coastal plain until he had secured his right flank by the capture of Amman. As a result, the whole of the Ottoman 4th Army was employed in monitoring and harassing the Occupation of the Jordan Valley (1918) by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force leaving the extreme right of their line comparatively weak and giving Allenby an opportunity to attack on the coast of the Mediterranean in mid-September 1918. Little recalled today, the Es Salt operation was with the exception of the Gallipoli evacuation, perhaps the most 'close run thing' to occur to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in the whole Sinai and Palestine campaign. The Ottoman attack on 1 May quickly overwhelmed the 4th Light Horse Brigade and that it managed to withdraw in as good an order as it did, in confused and dangerous circumstances, is testimony to the experience of the troops and the quality of the junior, squadron and regimental leadership. If the brigade had been lost at this time, virtually the entire Australian Imperial Force in the Middle East could have been captured. The Desert Mounted Corps followed these operations with a long, hot, dusty and disease-plagued summer in the Jordan Valley while Allenby's army's British troops were replaced by Indian Army troops before the Battle of Megiddo.Bou 2009 p. 188 Beni Sakr The Beni Sakhr did not turn up at all. The envoys who offered support represented only a small sub-tribe, and when they got back from their conference, they found all their fighting men had gone south to join the Hejazis.

Kopatzky also used the names Igor Orlov, Aleksandr Navratilov and Calvus, and his Soviet codenames were Erwin, Herbert and Richard. In 1941, after the start of the German-Soviet war, Kopazky attended a Soviet training school for agents of the NKVD. In October 1943 he was on a parachute jump over occupied Kresy where the German Wehrmacht arrested him and he was taken prisoner of war. From 1944, he acted as an agent of the Department of Foreign Armies against the Red Army in Vlasov‚Äôs Army. In 1945, he came into American captivity and came into contact with the Gehlen Organization, which he was recruited into by 1948. He married Eleanor Stirner, the daughter of a former SS functionary. From 1949, Kopazky was recruited by the KGB and became one of its most important double agents. The CIA sent him to Berlin in 1951 under the name Franz Koischwitz. He was officially shut down in late 1951 as an agent, but still kept his jobs. On 7 November 1951, he kidnapped the Estonian CIA agent Vlkadimir Kivi from West Berlin to East Berlin on behalf of the KGB. In 1954, with the help of the CIA, he changed his name to Igor Orlov. In 1957, he attended agent training in the USA and was reinstated in 1958 to Europe. In 1960, he was transferred back to the U.S. As a result of the defection of the former KGB agent Anatoliy Golitsyn, the FBI sought Kopazky, who was suspected of being the Soviet mole, ‚Ä≥Sasha‚Ä≥ (later disproved) After a house search in 1965, he fled for a short time in the Soviet consulate.

It can significantly save time and bandwidth. The name is drawn from the fact that the Greek letter delta, Œî or Œ¥, is used to denote change in mathematical sciences.  Example  Any app that is ready for updating can be updated faster and more efficiently due to this new system. If, for example, a game that is 300 megabytes is updated with a new racetrack that adds an additional two megabytes to the application's size, only two megabytes will be downloaded instead of 302 megabytes.  Uses   Linux  Fedora Linux has supported binary delta updates by default using the yum presto plugin since June 2009. This is based on RPM Package Manager's deltarpm system (2004), which was in turn based on bsdiff. This functionality has been inherited by Fedora-derived operating systems, including RedHat Enterprise Linux and its variant, CentOS. OpenSUSE also uses deltarpms with its zypper manager. A more primitive system, the SUSE patchrpm, worked by replacing changed files. A similar system for the dpkg-APT package manager system of Debian is debdelta (2006); despite an apparent halt on the homepage, its package repository as well as the source code remains actively maintained. (for source code, see debian \\"developer information\\" for package; for repository, see http://debdeltas.debian.net/debian-deltas/pool/.) Debdelta is not installed by default and not many mirrors have been set up for it. A member of the developer team has proposed yet another format that integrates directly into the currently mirrored main repositories called patch debs in 2018. It is intended to have more integrity checks. A descendant of Debian, Ubuntu developers have tried over and over to implement delta updates for their system. Around 2006 they tried to create one, but was confronted with too many options and dropped the efforts. In 2011 they tried to just set up debdelta, but dropped the efforts in May of that year. The Arch Linux package manager pacman used to support a form of delta updating using VCDiff (xdelta). It was scrapped due to an arbitrary command execution vulnerability () due to a lack of string escaping.  Windows  Windows Update has supported delta updates since Windows XP which are called express installation files. On redistributing updates, Windows Server Update Services has supported delta updates since Windows Server 2003.  FreeBSD  FreeBSD has supported delta updates using portsnap since November 2005. Given FreeBSD's traditional stance of focusing on source code updates, no method of delta binary updates currently exists.  Google  Google refers to delta updates as \\"smart updates.\\" This has been implemented in Google's Android operating system devices that run on Android 2.3 or above. Google engineers have estimated that smart updates would be only about one third the size of a full update on average. Google's open source project Chromium requires frequent updates to narrow the window of vulnerability. It uses a disassembly-based diffing algorithm called \\"courgette\\" to reduce diff size of two binary executable files, which reduces the diff patch from 6.7% (bsdiff) to 0.76% (bsdiff + courgette) for one version update. The technology helped Chrome to push its updates to 100% of users in less than 10 days. App APK updates in Android's Play Store use bsdiff since 2016, a new efficient delta update algorithm introduced in 2003. Google Play‚Äôs new delta algorithm reduces size of Android app updates  Apple iOS  Apple's iOS is also capable of delta updates for operating system and application updates making users reducing bandwidth usage and reliance on the iTunes desktop software to download and apply updates.  Over-the-air software updates  Over-the-air (OTA) software updates have been used widely across many mobile devices; Apple iOS, Google Android, Microsoft Windows Phone 8, and BlackBerry 10.

Portuguese versions may use espresso, lemon, mint and rum, and Austrian versions are served with an ice cube and include rum. Sometimes a fast version is achieved by pouring a previously sweetened espresso in a cup with ice cubes and a slice of lemon. Mazagran has been described as \\"the original iced coffee\\". History and origin It has been stated that the drink's name probably originated from a fortress named Mazagran in Algiers, Algeria which in 1837 through the Treaty of Tafna was granted to France. At the Mazagran fortress French colonial troops consumed the beverage, which was prepared with coffee syrup and cold water. It has also been stated that the drink's name and invention may have originated from French Foreign Legion soldiers who, during the time of the siege of Mazagran, Algeria during the 1840 war, used water in their coffee in the absence of milk or brandy and drank the beverage cold to counter the heat. Furthermore, French colonial troops near Mazagran were served a beverage prepared with coffee syrup and water. When the soldiers returned to Paris, they suggested to caf√©s to serve the beverage and the notion of it being served in tall glasses. Upon this introduction, the beverage was named caf√© mazagran. In France, coffee served in glasses is referred to as \\"mazagrin\\". Preparation and varieties Mazagran is prepared with strong, hot coffee that is poured over ice, and it is typically served in a narrow, tall glass. It has also been described as \\"coffee taken with water instead of milk\\", in which coffee is served in a tall glass along with a separate container of water to mix in with the coffee. The beverage has also been described as sweetened \\"Portuguese iced coffee\\" that is prepared with strong coffee or espresso served over ice with lemon. Sometimes rum is added to Portuguese versions of the drink, and it may be sweetened with sugar syrup. In Austria, mazagran coffee is served with an ice cube and prepared with rum. The beverage is typically downed \\"in one gulp\\". In Catalonia, it is made with ice coffee and lemon. In the mid 1990s, Starbucks and PepsiCo developed a line of flavored carbonated mazagran beverages named \\"Mazagran\\" that were prepared with coffee. After a short trial run in California in 1994, the drink was discontinued after failing to catch on with consumers. A useful new by-product of Starbucks' research and development of mazagran was a coffee extract that could be used in various coffee-flavored products. The coffee extract was later used in the preparation of pre-mixed, bottled Starbucks' frappuccino drinks that are sold in grocery stores. The extract is also used in the company's bottled double shot and iced coffee drinks.

Designed and built in Italy, it was first presented in public in April 2011. Design and development The Tecnam P2010 is a larger, four seat relative of the Tecnam P2008 two seat braced high wing light aircraft. Both types have metal wings and tailplane on a composite fuselage with integrated fin. The wing leading edge is straight except for some pinching at the root and the wing has constant chord on the inner section. Outboard, the trailing edge is tapered; the straight wing tips are slightly upturned. Ailerons span the outboard panels and the inner sections carry flaps. There is a single lift strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage. The P2010 has a low set all-moving constant-chord tailplane with an anti-balance tab. The fin is swept and the rudder moves above the tailplane. The P2010 is powered by a 135 kW (180 hp) Lycoming IO-360-M1A horizontally opposed four cylinder piston engine, with a 215 hp Lycoming IO-390 option available. The cabin seats the pilot and three passengers in two side-by-side rows, accessed by three doors. Its fixed tricycle undercarriage has spring cantilever main legs and a castoring nosewheel. All wheels have speed fairings. The P2010 was first seen in public at AERO Friedrichshafen 2011 and first flew on 12 April 2012. The company initially planned to have US FAR Part 23 certification completed by November 2012 and said it would refund deposits if the aircraft was not certified by the end of 2014. European European Aviation Safety Agency certification was completed in September 2014, with American Federal Aviation Administration certification completed in December 2015. On 27 May 2020 Tecnam introduced a diesel-powered upgrade, the P2010 TDI, with a liquid-cooled 170-hp engine capable of using either diesel or jet fuel. Its 5.2 gph consumption provides a significant range increase (1050nm vs. 660nm for gasoline-powered version). Certification by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency was expected to be completed by July 2020, with approval from other countries to follow. The diesel engine's range advantage was balanced by three disadvantages: the engine must be replaced after 1,200 hrs; the unit price increased to around $412,000 USD (from $345,000 USD for the gasoline version); and cruise speed is lower (136kt, vs. 145kt for the 215hp gasoline version). Operational history Tecnam announced that they sold 30 delivery positions for P2010s at Aero 2011. By July 2015, 25 aircraft had been delivered to customers.

It is found off the coasts of northwest Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea, where it lives buried in sandy sediments. Bivalves are molluscs with a body compressed between two usually similar shell valves joined by an elastic ligament. There are teeth at the edge of the shell and the animal has a muscular foot, gills, siphons, mouth and gut and is surrounded by a mantle inside the shell. Description The shell of T. tenuis is brittle and flattened and grows to up to nineteen millimeters in length. The outline is oval but the valves are asymmetric with the hinge slightly off centre and the beaks slightly behind the midline. The posterior of the valves is attenuated slightly and the right valve is slightly larger than the left. An olive green ligament joins the two valves. The periostracum is glossy and the colour varies through shades of pink, yellow and brown, often in bands. There is a sculpture of fine concentric lines which is grouped into growth stages and which may be emphasized by bands of colour. The inner sides of the valves are similarly coloured but paler. The mantle is fringed with tentacles and is creamy-white.Marine Species Identification Portal Distribution Tellina tenuis occurs off the coasts of north west Europe and Morocco and in the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea. It is found from the middle shore level to a depth of about seven metres. It is widely distributed and common around the coasts of the British Isles.Marine Bivalve Shells of the British Isles Biology Tellina tenuis burrows in clean sand and has a large foot and two long siphons which it extends to the surface of the sediment. Water and food particles are drawn down to the mollusc through one siphon while water is expelled through the other. It is both a deposit and a filter feeder.Barrett, J. H. and C. M. Yonge, 1958. Collins Pocket Guide to the Sea Shore. P. 161. Collins, London The mollusc usually lies on its left side when feeding. When the tide is out it descends to a depth of about ten centimetres but ascends to nearer the sediment surface when feeding. At the low tide level it may be the most abundant macro-organism in the benthos and may reach a density of 3000 individuals per square metre. Individual molluscs are either male or female and gametes are liberated into the water table during the summer. The larvae are free swimming and form part of the zooplankton for a period. The lifespan is up to 5 years. Ecology The closely related species, Tellina fabula is found over the same distribution range but the two are not usually in competition as T fabula occurs from low water level to a depth of about forty metres. Because of its greater exposure at low tides, T tenuis is more susceptible to harm in cold winter weather.Encyclopedia of Life Young flatfish sometimes feed on the tips of the protruding siphons.

Lebaran or Idul Fitri is the popular name for Eid al-Fitr in Indonesia and is one of the major national holidays in the country. Lebaran holiday officially lasts for two days in the Indonesian calendar, although the government usually declares a few days before and after the Lebaran as a bank holiday. Many individuals or families, especially Muslims take paid time off from their workplace during these days. Etymology \\"Idul Fitri\\" is Indonesian spelling of Arabic \\"Eid al-Fitr\\". While \\"lebaran\\" is localized name for this festive occasion, the etymology is not clear. It is suggested derived from Javanese word lebar which means \\"finished\\", then the word \\"lebar\\" is absorbed into Indonesian language with additional suffix \\"-an\\", so it becomes a common vocabulary for a celebration when the fasting ritual is \\"finished‚Äù, or derived from Sundanese word lebar which means \\"abundance\\" or \\"many\\" to describe the abundance of foods and delicacies served for visiting guests; family, relatives, neighbors and friends during this festive occasion. Another theory suggested, \\"lebaran\\" is derived from Betawi, lebar which means \\"wide and broad\\", so the celebration means to broaden or widen one's heart feeling after fasting ritual of Ramadhan. Madurese people have also a similar word called lober to describe the completion of Ramadhan fast. It is also possible the word 'lebaran' derived from the word luber > luber-an > lebaran, which means overflow or flocking. The term lebaran usually used specific to describe Eid al-Fitr Islamic holiday, however in looser terms it sometimes used to describe similar festivals and celebrations. For example, in Indonesian the term lebaran haji (lit: hajj's lebaran) is informally used to describe Eid al- Adha, also lebaran cina (lit:Chinese lebaran) for Chinese New Year. Christmas however, although bearing similarity in abundance of foods, is never referred to as lebaran, but just Natal or natalan instead. History Eid mass prayer on open field during colonial Dutch East Indies period. The Lebaran etymology was derived from Javanese word, and according to Indonesian Muslim scholar Umar Khayam, lebaran tradition was the result of acculturation between Javanese culture and Islam during the 15th-century. According to Javanese traditions, the local lebaran tradition of Idul Fitri was first started when Sunan Bonang, one of Wali Songo of Tuban in 15th-century Java, calls for the Muslims to elevate the perfection of their Ramadhan fast by asking forgiveness and forgiving others' wrongdoings.Mahfud MD: \\"Sejarah Lebaran\\" The asking and giving for forgiveness during Eid ul Fitr is quite unique among Indonesian Muslims, that did not occur among Muslims of Middle East, Indian subcontinent or elsewhere. Most of world Muslims would only expressed Eid Mubarak (blessed Eid). Other lebaran traditions that uniquely local and derived from Javanese traditions are sungkem and consuming ketupat. Sungkem is Javanese tradition to ask for blessing and forgiveness from parents, grandparents and elders. The parents sitting on the chair while the children and youngsters bowing deep with their nose tip touches their hands that rest upon parents' laps. It is the sign of humility, expressing dedication and honoring parents and elders. Another tradition is consuming ketupat or kupat in Javanese language. The tradition on preparing and consuming ketupat during lebaran is believed to be introduced by Sunan Kalijaga, one of Wali Songo that spread Islam in Java, as it contains some symbolism. It is believed that kupat means ngaku lepat or \\"admitting one's mistakes\\" in Javanese. The crossed weaving of palm leaves symbolizes mistakes and sins committed by human beings, and the inner whitish rice cake symbolize purity and deliverance from sins after observing Ramadhan fast, prayer and rituals. Other than Java, the tradition on consuming ketupat during Eid ul Fitr is also can be found throughout Indonesia; from Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, also to neighboring Malaysia. Prior to Lebaran Ramadhan bazaar selling various products to celebrate Ramadhan and Lebaran. Lebaran bonus Additionally, in Indonesia Idul Fitri has a legally mandated salary bonus for all employees, known as Tunjangan Hari Raya (THR) as initially enforced by Indonesia's Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration (Kementerian Tenaga Kerja dan Transmigrasi) in the 1950s. The mandated amount of this salary bonus differs by region. For example, within the Jakarta region it must not be less than one month's full salary paid in advance of Idul Fitri, in addition to the employee's regular salary. Thus, Idul Fitri is also a paid holiday. Breaching or withholding THR is a very serious labour law infraction and punished severely, regardless of employer status or position. Lebaran shopping Lebaran bazaar in Semarang offering food and clothes for lebaran holiday. Other than shopping for typical food and kue kering (cookies) for Lebaran, Indonesians usually will buy and wear new clothes and footwear. Shopping malls and bazaars are usually filled with people to get things for Lebaran such as clothes, footwear, even food to serve days ahead of Idul Fitri, which creates a distinctive festive atmosphere throughout the country, along with traffic mayhem around shopping malls and marketplaces. Lebaran also creates special occasions for shopping that often generate seasonal retail business. As the result retail businesses will try to attracts shoppers with special Lebaran discounts, Lebaran-themed decorations, and playing joyous Lebaran-themed or Islamic musics in their stores. The festive shopping feel is quite similar with Christmas for Christians, however the things bought (usually fashion apparels), is rather for oneself, not as a gift. Many banks, government and private offices are closed for the duration of the Lebaran festivities. Mudik lebaran Thousands of motorcyclist family clogs the street during mudik home-coming. One of the largest temporary human migrations globally is the prevailing custom of the Lebaran where workers, particularly unskilled labourers such as maids and construction workers, return to their home town or city to celebrate with their families and to ask forgiveness from parents, in-laws, and other elders. This is known in Indonesia as mudik or pulang kampung (homecoming). It is an annual tradition that people in big cities such as Greater Jakarta, Bandung, Surabaya, or elsewhere, travel to their hometowns or other cities to visit relatives, to ask forgiveness, or just to celebrate with the whole family. The government of Indonesia provides additional transportation to handle the massive surge of travellers in several days prior and after the lebaran. In 2013 there are around 30 million people travels to their hometowns during lebaran holiday, brought and spend the total sum of money around 90 trillion rupiah (around US$9 billion) from main urban centers to rural areas, pulsing economic opportunities and business from the city to the villages. The numbers of Indonesians that took mudik or pulang kampung travel is quite tremendous, the numbers is slightly equal with the whole population of Malaysia hit the road altogether, causing massive traffic jams and a sudden rise of demand and volume of intercity transportations. The impact is indeed tremendous as millions of cars and motorcycles jam the roads and highways, causing kilometres of traffic jams each year.Govt says roads ready for Lebaran exodus. The Jakarta Post ‚Äì 2 September 2010 The annual massive congestion usually occurs along Java's Northern Coast Road. Additionally, the wealthier classes often go to local hotels or overseas to accommodate the absence of their domestic servants, drivers and even security guards. Singaporean, Malaysian and Indonesian hotels have been particularly successful marketing lucrative Lebaran or Idul Fitri \\"escape package\\". Takbiran Takbiran parade in Yogyakarta, a night before Lebaran. The night before Idul Fitri is called takbiran, filled with the sounds of bedug drums and many muezzin chanting the takbir in the mosques or musallahs. In larger cities people usually fill the streets and also chanting takbir in their cars and motorcycles, which often creating the night with traffic jam. In some instances fireworks and firecrackers might be ignited, however these actions is discouraged by police officers as it could be dangerous to lit these explosives over the crowd. In many parts of Indonesia, especially in the rural areas, pelita, obor or lampu tempel (oil lamps, similar to tiki torches) are lit up and placed outside and around homes. Some cities, such as Yogyakarta, organized a more festive annual parade featuring colorful Islamic-themed lantern-like floats. Lebaran day Thousands of Indonesian Muslims congregated during Eid ul Fitr mass prayer in Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, the largest mosque in Southeast Asia, located in Central Jakarta, Indonesia. On the Lebaran day, after performing Eid prayer in the morning, people dressed in their new or best clothes will gather to greet their family and neighbours. It is common to greet people with \\"Selamat Idul Fitri\\" which means \\"Happy Eid\\". Muslims also greet one another with \\"mohon maaf lahir dan batin\\", which means \\"Forgive my physical and emotional (wrongdoings)\\", because Idul Fitri is not only for celebrations but also a time for atonement to ask for forgiveness for sins which they may have committed but was cleansed as a result of the fasting in the Muslim month of Ramadan. From the morning to afternoon, the zakat alms for the poor are usually distributed in mosques. Lebaran feast Ketupat is a popular traditional celebrative dish for Eid al-Fitr meal in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Southern Thailand. Kue kering, popular lebaran cookies. Families usually will have special Lebaran meal served during breakfast, brunch or lunch; special dishes will be served such as ketupat, opor ayam, rendang, sambal goreng ati, sayur lodeh and lemang (a type of glutinous rice cake cooked in bamboo). Various types of snacks; roasted peanuts, kue, cookies, dodol and imported dates sweet delicacies are also served during this day, together with fruit syrup beverages. The lively or alternatively very emotional devotional music blended with Quranic verses associated with Ramadan and Eid ‚Äì known as Kaisidah or more correctly, Qasida ‚Äì can be heard throughout the country. These are commonly performed by famous musicians, some of whom may be international stars, and televised nationwide. Silaturrahmi and lebaran money Younger families usually visit their older neighbours or relatives to wish and greet them a Happy Eid also to ask for forgiveness. During these visits, it is a customs for older, established or married couple to give uang lebaran, small amount of moneys for children of their own, relatives' as well as neighbours'. Idul Fitri is a very joyous day for children as adults give them money in colourful envelopes. To cater for this customs, Indonesian Banks and Bank Indonesia usually open some money changer counters to change larger to smaller denominations several days prior to Lebaran. The denominations may vary from 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 to 10,000 rupiah. The sudden rise of demands on goods (especially food) and service (especially transportation), and the pulsing and distribution of newly printed small denomination bank notes from the central bank, has caused Indonesian economy a seasonal inflation annually. Lebaran costumes It is customary for Muslim-Indonesians to wear a traditional clothing on Eid al-Fitr. The male outfit is known as baju koko: a collarless long or short-sleeve shirt with traditional embroidered designs with a \\"kilt\\" sarung of songket, ikat or similar woven, plaid-cloth. Alternatively, they may wear either Western-style business suits or more traditional loose-fitting trousers with colour-matched shirts, and either a peci hat or regional cultural headwear and songkok. The Malay variant worn in Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Southern Thailand and parts of Indonesia (especially in Sumatera and Kalimantan) is known as the Baju Melayu, shirt worn with a sarong known as kain samping or songket and a headwear known as songkok. Traditional female dress is known as kebaya kurung. It consists of, normally, a loose-fitting kebaya blouse (which may be enhanced with brocade and embroidery), a long skirt both of which may be batik, or the sarung skirt made of batik, ikat or songket and for some women either the jilbab (hijab) or its variant the stiffened kerudung Veil. Non-Austronesian Muslims, or even non-Muslims may don costumes of their respective culture and tradition, or Islamic clothes to show respect to their relatives' or friends' differing religious beliefs for the occasion. This is particularly common in Indonesia, where many families have close friends or relatives of differing faiths, namely Catholic, some Protestant, some Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim. Visiting graves Ziarah makam or visiting the grave of family or prominent Muslim figure. It is common for many Muslims in Indonesia to visit the graves of loved ones several days before Ramadhan. During this visit, they will clean the grave, recite Ya-Seen, a chapter (sura) from the Quran and also perform the tahlil ceremony. All these are done as a means to ask God to forgive both the dead and the living for their sins. The Javanese majority of Indonesia are known for their pre-Islamic Kejawen traditions of washing the headstone using scented water from the traditional terracotta water-jug, the kendi, and sprinkling hyacinth and jasmine over the graves. After lebaran Several days after lebaran usually marked with arus balik (returning waves) of mudik lebaran (lebaran home-coming). People returning to cities of their workplaces from their hometowns, and just like the mudik lebaran it create massive temporary migrations that requires large amount of transportation for travellers that often resulted in gridlock traffic. Halal bi-halal In Indonesia there is a special ritual called halal bi-halal. During this, Muslim Indonesians visit their elders, in the family, the neighbourhood, or their work, and show respect to them. This could be done during or several days after Idul Fitri. Usually core family and neighbour first during first day of Idul Fitri, further relatives in the next day, and colleagues in days to weeks later after they get back to work. They will also seek reconciliation (if needed), and preserve or restore harmonious relations.van Doorn-Harder, Nelly. \\"Southeast Asian culture and Islam\\".

The Government of Pakistan established the Department of Insurance in April 1948 as a department of the Ministry of Commerce; the aim of this department is to take care of affairs related to the insurance industry. Out of the 54% that Pakistan's service sector contributes to the national GDP, insurance, along with transport, storage, communications and finance occupy 24% of the sector. The insurance industry in Pakistan is relatively small compared to its peers in the region. The insurance penetration and density remained very modest as compared to other jurisdictions while the insurance sector remained underdeveloped relative to its potential. The Pakistani insurance market has undergone major structural changes in last few years through mergers of companies to meet the increased statutory requirement of minimum paid up capital as per Insurance Ordinance 2000. Some companies who were unable to raise this capital have been asked to close down their operations. The Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), Insurance Division, is trying to improve the image of Pakistan Insurance Industry by issuing directives on financial security and transparency, code of good governance and sound market practice. The year 2015 showed improvement in Pakistan‚Äôs overall economic indicators including containment of current account deficit, owing to continuing decline in international oil prices along with an uplift in remittances from abroad. The successful issue of Sukuk Bond in the international market also helped the foreign exchange reserves to swell to unprecedented levels. China and Pakistan have made agreements to establish China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) between the two countries. The corridor is expected to boost economy, trade and connectivity of Pakistan with the regional countries. As part of CPEC, Pakistan has also signed a series of energy projects with China, which will enable to overcome the energy crisis in foreseeable future. The economy grew by 4.24% in fiscal year 2015 which is highest achievement since 2008-2009. Inflation during the year has remained significantly low, achieving the lowest levels since 2003. The services sector registered a growth of 5 percent against the target of 5.2% but remained higher compared to the last year growth of 4.4%.

Details Mettingham Castle was formed by Sir John de Norwich, who was given a licence to crenellate his existing manor house on the site in 1342.Mackenzie, p.283. The first house stood within a small moat, up to 15 foot wide with 6 foot high banks; upon receiving permission to crenellate, however, he built another court to the north of this, again moated, with a gateway to the north.Wall, p.621. Another moated court was later built to the south. An Edwardian style gatehouse formed the entrance to the castle and supplemented a stone wall that surrounded the property.Mackenzie, p.284; Mettingham Castle, National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 17 July 2011. By 1562, there were \\"stables, servants' lodgings, kitchen, bakehouse, brewhouse, malting house, storehouses, and an aisled hall\\" within the castle walls.Mettingham Castle, National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 17 July 2011. A late 19th century plan of the castle The castle remained in Sir John's family until 1394, when it was given to a college of secular canons from nearby Norton, who established themselves on the small moated court within the castle.Mackenzie, p.283; Wall, p.621. The monks taught up to 13 boys at the castle.Mettingham Castle, English Heritage, accessed 17 July 2011. After the dissolution of the monasteries the property was sold off to a sequence of private owners after 1542. The castle was largely demolished in the 18th century to make way for a new farm house on the site, which lasted until around 1880 when it was pulled down in turn; the house rebuilt on the site reused parts of the original medieval stonework.Mackenzie, p.285; Mettingham Castle, National Monuments Record, English Heritage, accessed 17 July 2011. Today the site is a scheduled monument and a grade 2 listed building; the gatehouse still survives, as do some of the stone walls and many of the surrounding moats and earthworks.Mettingham Castle, Gatehouse website, accessed 18 July 2011. In the 21st century a major renovation project occurred at the castle to repair the worsening damage, involving a grant of ¬£330,000 by English Heritage.

He graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York city. He served with the American Ceylon Mission (ACM) in Jaffna, Sri Lanka during the period (1847‚Äì1873) when it was the British colony of Ceylon. During his tenure he founded the Sri Lanka's first medical hospital and school in what later became the Green Memorial Hospital in Manipay in the Jaffna peninsula. He translated and published over 4000 pages of medical literature from English to Tamil as part of his efforts to train doctors in their native language. He was personally responsible for training over 60 native doctors of whom majority had their instructions in Tamil. Early life Green was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, to William E. Green and Julia Plimpton as the eighth of 11 children. After his secondary schooling, he was attracted to religion. In 1841 he went to New York City and joined the Protestant Episcopal Board of Missions. During this period he became interested in the medical profession and joined as a medical student and graduating as a doctor in 1845. In 1846, he joined the American Mission and along with a team of missionaries was sent to Ceylon now Sri Lanka. His brother was Andrew Haswell Green, who was instrumental in completing New York City's Central park. Green retired to Green Hills, Massachusetts in 1873 due to ill health. He died in 1884. Missionary work After a four month trip from America, he moved to Ceylon via Madras Presidency in British India in 1847. He initially served at the ACM mission at the Batticotta Seminary. Although the locals were reluctant use his services, eventually with his capability he became well known for his medical skills. As he attracted a lot of patients and it distracted Batticotta seminaries primary task of education, he was moved to another ACM mission station in Manipay in 1848. At Manipay, in addition to providing medical services to patients who came in search of him, he established the first medical school to teach western medicine to the Tamil people of Jaffna, thus opening, Sri Lanka's first medical hospital and teaching facility that became known as Green memorial hospital. Green Memorial Hospital was managed by the Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South India (JDCSI) the successor organization of ACM. It celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Green Memorial Hospital, and the ACM medical mission, in October 1998. Translating from English to Tamil Initially when Dr. Green appealed for assistance for the publication of some medical books in Tamil, the colonial government refused aid. But after a decade, the same government doubled its aid and also requested Dr. Green to superintend the preparation and printing of Sanitary and Medical action related literature in Cholera times. Dr. Green wanted to prepare the trained physicians to stay in their native villages to help the locals instead migrating to find work within the colonial administration. To teach western medicine in Tamil, he had to coin technical terms in Tamil, translate western medical books into Tamil and write medical books in Tamil. This meant the development of medical and scientific Tamil as different from the established literary Tamil. There was also a need to write medical treatises in simple Tamil for the benefit of the common people ‚Äì the layman.

Retrieved 15 July 2011. Biography Born in Frankfurt, Germany, Seligmann moved to Paris in 1874 where he worked for Paul Chevallier, an auctioneer, and Charles Mannheim, an art expert, before opening his own business on the Rue des Mathurins in 1880 with Edmond de Rothschild as one of his early clients. In 1900, together with his brothers Arnold and Simon, he established the firm Jacques Seligmann & Cie. which moved the same year to the Place Vend√¥me. Seligman opened a New York office in 1904, visiting it once a year. His customers included members of the Russian Stroganoff family, the high-flying British politician Sir Philip Sassoon and American collectors such as Benjamin Altman, William Randolph Hearst, J. P. Morgan, Henry Walters, and Joseph Widener. Initially Seligmann dealt mainly in antiques including enamels, ivories, sculptures, tapestries and especially 18th century French furniture but paintings became increasingly important at the beginning of the 20th century. After the end of the First World War, interest in European art grew in the United States led by socialites such as Walter Arensberg, Albert C. Barnes, Louisine Havemeyer, Bertha Palmer, Duncan Phillips, and John Quinn. In 1909, Seligmann bought the prestigious H√¥tel de Monaco where he established his headquarters and received his most important clients. After a dispute with his brother Arnold, there was a split in the company: Arnold continued to manage the Place Vend√¥me site as Arnold Seligmann & Cie. while Seligmann consolidated his activities at the H√¥tel de Monaco and, in 1912, opened a new Paris office at 9 Rue de la Paix. In 1914, Seligmann opened a new office and gallery on New York's Fifth Avenue and incorporated his company in the State of New York. The same year, while in Paris, he was successful in buying a large part of Sir Richard Wallace's renowned collection which contained a variety of valuable antiques and art works.\\"Scott Collection Deal.; Jacques Seligmann Says He Plans to Sell Each Object Separately\\", New York Times, May 27, 1914.

The film is a fictionalized account of Isherwood's time living in Berlin between the World Wars. Directed by Henry Cornelius, from a script by John Collier, I Am a Camera stars Laurence Harvey as Isherwood and Julie Harris recreating her Tony Award-winning performance as Sally Bowles. The film was critically unsuccessful upon its release in both the United Kingdom and the United States, and it was subjected to restrictive ratings. Long overshadowed by Cabaret, the 1966 stage and 1972 film adaptation of the same source material, contemporary critics have noted the historic interest of this earlier presentation. Plot In contemporary London, Christopher Isherwood attends a literary party for the launch of a memoir, the author of which he is surprised to learn is Sally Bowles. This knowledge sparks a reverie, and the film flashes back to Berlin, New Year's Eve 1931. Broke and frustrated with his writing, Christopher plans to spend the night in, but his would-be gigolo friend Fritz insists they go to a night club to see Fritz's new inamorata, Sally Bowles, perform. Fritz hopes to live off Sally's earnings as a film star, but his ardor quickly cools at the sight of her fianc√© Pierre, with whom she plans to leave for Paris that night. Instead, Pierre absconds with her money. Chris, taking pity on her, invites her to stay at his boarding house. They arrange for Chris to move to a smaller room, and for Sally to take his old room. Over the course of a long and unproductive winter, in which Chris cannot write, and Sally finds no work, Chris attempts to initiate a sexual relationship with Sally. She rejects him, saying it would spoil their friendship. Their spirits renewed by the Spring, Christopher and Sally splurge on a Champagne cocktail at a caf√©, and Sally quickly orders far more cocktails and caviar than they can afford. They are extricated from the situation by wealthy American socialite Clive Mortimer, who pays their bill and takes them on a tour of Berlin night spots. Thus begins a whirlwind relationship between the three, culminating in a planned trip to Honolulu. The trip never happens, as Clive wires that his plans have changed. Chris and Sally have a terrible fight, resulting in a rift in their friendship, and Sally's planned departure. Feeling as though he has reconnected with real life, the formerly a-political Christopher starts a street altercation with a group of Nazis. Returning home, he discovers that Sally has not left, because she is pregnant. Christopher proposes marriage, but Sally refuses him. Writing up an account of his Nazi altercation, Chris sells his \\"Portrait of Berlin\\" to an American magazine to raise money for Sally to have an abortion. The magazine editor hires Chris to write a series of portraits of European cities, expecting him to leave the following day. When he returns home, Sally has changed her mind; she plans to keep the baby and marry Chris. The next morning, Sally tells Chris that she has miscalculated the dates, and was never actually pregnant. She is also leaving Berlin for Paris, in pursuit of a film executive with whom Clive has connected her. Back in present-day London, Christopher and Sally re-unite. Upon learning that Sally is again penniless and homeless, Chris invites her to stay in his spare room. In a subplot, Fritz tries to secure the affections of Natalia Landauer, a wealthy Jewish department store heiress and Christopher's student of English. When Natalia fails to respond to his charms, Sally suggests that he \\"pounce\\", i. e., make a sexual advance. He reports that this tactic is unsuccessful, and Natalia refuses to see him. Fritz confesses to Christopher that he is Jewish and has been concealing it for years, but vows to stop lying about his heritage. Their story concludes with Fritz and Natalia's announcement to Chris and Sally that they plan to marry and emigrate to Switzerland.

In April 1954, director Henry Cornelius and the Woolfs sent a copy of the play to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) for evaluation. The Board's preliminary report found numerous problems with the play which, if unchanged, would inevitably lead to an X certificate (no one under 16 admitted). The Board's initial report offered suggestions for how the play could be adapted to secure an A certificate (suitable for children if accompanied by an adult), including shifting the play's focus away from Sally Bowles, but recognized that such changes were unlikely because of how markedly they would depart from the original play.Aldgate and Robertson, pp. 66‚Äì67 Director Henry Cornelius asked Isherwood to write the screenplay. He was forced to decline, as he was engaged working on the screenplay for Diane, a biopic of Diane de Poitiers, for Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer in Hollywood.Fryer, pp. 250‚Äì251 The first draft of John Collier's screenplay was submitted to the BBFC in October 1954. While the screenplay was being prepared, the Board sent four different examiners to see the play. Each agreed that the play as written was unsuitable for filming, although one held out hope that modifications could be made to allow for the A rating.Aldgate and Robertson, pp. 70‚Äì73 The BBFC demanded changes to the script, including insisting that Sally Bowles be left poor and unsuccessful at film's end because of her sexual promiscuity in the Berlin flashbacks.Harper and Porter, p. 171 Negotiations between film-makers and the Board continued through November. Finally, on 29 November, a resolution was reached which left film- makers prepared for the likelihood that the film would be certified X regardless.Aldgate and Robertson, p. 73 Filming commenced in mid-October 1954. Cornelius had wanted to film in Berlin, but was unable to because of currency issues with the studio. Isherwood had hoped to be in London for the filming, but his lover Don Bachardy was unable to secure the permission of his local draft board to obtain a passport.Isherwood, p. 465 Ron Randell was cast on the strength of his stage and TV reputation. Ratings and certification The BBFC reviewed I Am a Camera on 9 May 1955, and objected to a single line of dialogue (\\"Surely he hasn't got a crush on shoes at his age?\\") that carried an implication of foot fetishism. With that line replaced, the film received an X certificate.Slide, p. 80 In 1961, Associated-Rediffusion asked the BBFC to review the film, hoping to secure an A certificate so as to broadcast the film on television. While acknowledging that the subject matter was mild in light of subsequent films like Room at the Top, Look Back in Anger, and Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, the BBFC found that the abortion subject matter prevented re-certification without re-editing.Aldgate and Robertson, pp. 75‚Äì76 Upon its American release, I Am a Camera was denied the Production Code Administration seal of approval. Joseph Breen of the PCA had reviewed a copy of the Van Druten play as early as May 1953, and deemed it to have multiple Code violations.

Shurlock, in denying PCA approval to the finished film, cited \\"gross sexual promiscuity on the part of the leading lady without the proper compensating moral values required by the Code\\".Shurlock, quoted in Slide, p. 80 This included the film's treatment of the subject of abortion. Many cinemas would not run the film without the seal. Fred J. Schwartz, head of American distributor Distributors Corporation of America, tried to schedule a hearing with the Motion Picture Association of America in August 1955, hoping to overturn the PCA decision and obtain the seal. Schwartz hired civil liberties lawyer Morris Ernst, and scheduled a screening at the Museum of Modern Art in November, hoping to turn the film into a test case against the Production Code. However, the film did not rally the critical support it would have needed to defy the code in the way that the 1953 film The Moon Is Blue had. In February 1956, Schwartz wrote to Shurlock offering to include an additional scene in which Harvey as Isherwood condemned Sally's promiscuity, but would not address the subject of abortion. The Production Code section on abortion was revised in December 1956, and Schwartz once again appealed to Shurlock. Shurlock responded later that month, re- affirming the denial on the basis of the light treatment of the subject matter. Following this denial, Schwartz dropped his pursuit of the seal.Slide, pp. 80‚Äì82 On 25 August 1955, the National Legion of Decency condemned I Am a Camera, and at least one cinema pulled the film in response to attacks on the film by Catholic priests.Slide, pp. 80‚Äì81 Reception Box Office The film was one of the most popular at the 1955 British box office. Critical response British critics were nearly uniform in their disappointment with I Am a Camera, with negative reviews appearing in the Evening News, the Daily Telegraph, the Financial Times, the Daily Mirror, the News Chronicle, and Tribune. Each believed that Laurence Harvey had been miscast as Isherwood. For the most part, they agreed that Harris's performance was a bright spot, although the Daily Sketch expressed a preference for Dorothy Tutin,Aldgate and Robertson, p. 75 who had played Sally on stage in 1954. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave I Am a Camera a bad review, finding it \\"meretricious, insensitive, superficial, and just plain cheap\\". Crowther was particularly appalled by John Collier's script, blasting it for largely abandoning both the Van Druten and Isherwood source material. He also sharply criticized the abortion material, deeming it a \\"capstone of cheap contrivance and tasteless indelicacy\\". Julie Harris he labeled a \\"show-off\\", while Laurence Harvey is \\"an anxious straight man for her jokes\\", with all parties directed by Cornelius with no eye to any subtlety of character. In an August 1955 pictorial, LIFE magazine called the film's party sequence \\"violently funny\\". LIFE praised Harris's acting, while at the same time finding the film spends too much time on Harris's character. Still, LIFE felt confident in predicting the film's success. Julie Harris was nominated for a 1956 BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress.Mayer, p. 201 Isherwood recorded his distaste for the film in his diary, noting his attendance at a 22 June 1955 preview. He found the film \\"a truly shocking and disgraceful mess. I must admit that John Collier is largely to blame ‚Äì for a sloppy, confused script. But everything is awful - except for Julie, who was misdirected.\\"Isherwood, p. 509 In a letter to friend John Lehmann, Isherwood called the film \\"disgusting ooh-la-la, near pornographic trash ‚Äì a shameful exhibition\\".Lehmann, p. 92 On the occasion of its video release in 1985, Lawrence Van Gelder, for The New York Times, found that this film, while suffering in comparison with the more lavish Cabaret, is still charming in its way, mostly because of Harris's performance as Sally.NEW CASSETTES: FROM 'COPPERFIELD' TO TOSCANINI Phil Hall reviewed I Am a Camera for Film Threat in 2005. He questioned the casting of Harvey as Isherwood, saying that the role called for a light comedic touch that was never Harvey's forte. Harvey's underplaying of the part, he wrote, clashes with Harris's unrestrained stage-style performance of hers. Still, he found that the film is \\"an intriguing curio\\" that garners interest for its exploration of the anti- Semitism that gave rise to the Nazis, and for its handling of \\"touchier aspects\\" of the original sources, including Isherwood's homosexualityIsherwood lived as more or less openly gay in Berlin, but concealed his homosexuality in the source material; the film would state only that the character Isherwood was a \\"confirmed bachelor\\". and Sally's abortion, which became a false pregnancy scare for the film.THE BOOTLEG FILES: \\"I AM A CAMERA\\" Notes References * Aldgate, Anthony and James Chrighton Robertson (2005).

The Lexington Principles were completed and published on April 1, 2009. The instrument consists of 45 principles and countless annotations prepared by the project's law student editorial board. A primary purpose of the drafters of the Lexington Principles was to assist the jurisprudential evolution of American constitutional due process standards after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Boumediene v. Bush. While each Principle is based on international law, all provisions have been drafted to facilitate vertical norm internalization into the domestic legal system of the United States and other common law countries. History Mission of the Lexington Principles Project > \\"The mission of the Lexington Principles Project is to engage the > international community to clarify and strengthen transnational norms > pertaining to due process of law and the treatment of persons detained on > suspicion of terrorist activities, and to foster a common approach to these > matters, in keeping with the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission on this > subject.\\". The 9/11 Commission On July 22, 2004, the 9/11 Commission issued its report on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In this report, the Commission made numerous recommendations to U.S. government officials on how to better defend the United States against the spread of international terrorism. In reference to detainee treatment standards, the Commission recommended that: > \\"(t)he United States should engage its friends to develop a common coalition > approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. > New principles might draw upon Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions on the > law of armed conflict. That article was specifically designed for those > cases in which the usual laws of war did not apply. Its minimum standards > are generally accepted throughout the world as customary international > law.\\".The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on > Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Ch 12 p 380 The White House responded to the 9-11 Commission's recommendation with the following statement: > \\"The United States has worked closely with its coalition partners regarding > the detention and treatment of captured terrorists, and is open to exploring > whether a \\"common coalition approach\\" is feasible and consistent with our > national security.\\". Seventeen months later the 9/11 Commission met again to grade the government's progress on implementing each of the 41 recommendations detailed in its Report. The Commission gave an \\"F\\" to the Commission's recommendation regarding \\"Coalition Standards for Terrorist Detention.\\". To explain its issuance of a failing grade with respect to the government's compliance with this recommendation, the Commission stated that: > \\"The U.S. has not engaged in a common coalition approach to developing > standards for detention and prosecution of captured terrorists. Indeed, U.S. > treatment of detainees has elicited broad criticism, and makes it harder to > build the necessary alliances to cooperate effectively with partners in a > global war on terror.\\". Washington and Lee University Several professors and alumni at Washington and Lee University sought to assist the process of implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendation by initiating a scholarly dialogue between military practitioners and legal experts aimed at identifying the high end of prevailing transnational norms pertaining to detainee treatment. They created The Lexington Principles Project and began the lengthy process of research and analysis that culminated in the publication of the Draft Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees on September 25, 2008. These draft principles were approved and published in final form on April 1, 2009 along with student- edited annotations. Methodology Codifying the Gold Standard in Transnational Detainee Treatment Standards The Lexington Principles Project's participants did not want simply to restate existing international norms. Many groups had already aptly performed that function and such an effort would have been redundant, and possibly even counterproductive to developing a universal approach to detainee treatment. The Lexington Principles Project therefore aimed to develop a progressive set of principles recognizing the highest standards set forth in international law and the domestic legal systems of foreign nations. Transnational Legal Process Approach To overcome the difficulties inherent in applying international law in domestic courts, the Lexington Principles Project structured its efforts in accordance with the theory of Transnational Legal Process developed by Harold Hongju Koh, the Dean of Yale Law School. The Project's use of this approach was facilitated by the availability of the considerable transnational law resources of the Transnational Law Institute at Washington and Lee University School of Law. Due Process Paradigm The Transnational Legal Process approach required the group to focus on vertical process throughout all stages of norm definition. The result was the creation of an innovative conceptual framework based on the familiar common law due process paradigm. Accordingly, the bulk of detainee rights under international law are categorized into one of three groups: # General Provisions # Procedural Due Process # Substantive Due Process Normative Translation The term \\"due process\\" is unique to common law legal systems, and is not generally found in the text of international human rights and humanitarian law treaties. Due process is a powerful concept at common law, so it was important for the Lexington Principles to be phrased in those terms. All of the transnational norms discovered during the lengthy research phase of the Lexington Principles Project needed to be translated into aspects of due process. This was accomplished by distilling all points of mutuality in the law governing detainee treatment under both international law and domestic U.S. law down to one central right: the right to physical liberty. Principle 1 of the Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees codified this right, and all other rights were drafted as essentially derivative of this central guarantee. Principle 1 states, \\"Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law.\\". Transnational Incorporation Doctrine The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine, first developed for the Lexington Principles, asserts that there are some principles of international law that are so fundamental to accepted global standards of justice that they should be implied as part the right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This is a new progressive theory that has yet to be adopted by the United States Supreme Court. The theory was constructed by the professors drafting the Lexington Principles as a means of offering modern judges a jurisprudential concept that could afford them the opportunity to recognize a host of modern human rights that have developed in legal systems around the world since the American Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. This conceptual mechanism for transnational norm internalization, if adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court, would give progressive American judges the opportunity to protect individual liberty by incorporating into the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause a variety of new and emerging human rights protections that pertain to modern American life in the Information Age. Liberty rights associated with privacy and personal autonomy in cyberspace were inconceivable in 1791 during the drafting of the original Bill of Rights. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would provide a way for courts to modernize the rights all American citizens enjoy vis-a-vis their government without the need to amend the Constitution through the cumbersome process prescribed in Article V. The formal amendment process makes meaningful change practically impossible to achieve, which is why the Lexington Principles Project crafted this new mechanism to facilitate bringing Americans rights up to the highest transnational standards. Moving Beyond Nationality and Territoriality A significant ancillary consequence of the novel and still unadopted Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would be its effect on the rights afforded to non-United States persons under U.S. law. Presently, United States citizens and permanent residents are afforded full protection under the United States Constitution both at home and abroad, with limited exceptions. Persons who are not American citizens or permanent residents are afforded no protection under the U.S. Constitution outside of U.S. borders and substantially diminished rights while on U.S. soil. The Transnational Incorporation Doctrine, if adopted, would change the American understanding of Constitutional rights making them \\"human\\" rights rather than rights tied to nationality or territorial location. Support for this result comes from the emerging transnational trend toward universality of international human rights law. Because international human rights are universal, the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine's new interpretation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause could result in universal application of all incorporated rights regardless of nationality or physical location. With respect to these newly domesticated transnational rights, former barriers to rights recognition based on nationality and territoriality would no longer affect applicability. Any rights incorporated through the Transnational Incorporation Doctrine would likely have to be universally afforded to all human beings by the U.S. government. These new transnational rights likely would not be nearly as extensive as those offered to U.S. citizens in the United States, but at a minimum they would ensure that the most fundamental due process rights are always afforded in all instances where a human being is detained by the U.S. government for any reason anywhere in the world. The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees (April 1, 2009) The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees I. Part I: General Provisions A. Section A: Fundamental Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law =1. Principle 1: Right to Physical Liberty and Due Process of Law= Physical liberty is a fundamental human right and may not be denied to any person without due process of law. B. Section B: Scope of Application =2. Principle 2: General Statement of Universal Applicability= The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and apply in all situations where a person has been detained by a State or its agents regardless of the reasons for, or circumstances surrounding, the detention. =3. Principle 3: Irrelevance of Geography= The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to the location of capture or detention. =4. Principle 4: Nondiscrimination= The fundamental protections inherent in the right to due process of law are universal and should be afforded to all persons detained by a State or its agents without regard to nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any other such criteria. C. Section C: State Responsibility =5. Principle 5: General Statement of State Responsibility to Protect= Each State has the responsibility to protect the right to physical liberty for all persons within its territory or otherwise under its control except insofar as they are properly detained in accordance with Principle 1. =6. Principle 6: Commencement of State Responsibility to Protect= At a minimum, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person begins at the moment the person is detained by its agents. =7. Principle 7: Duration of State Responsibility to Protect= Once initiated, a State's responsibility to protect the due process rights of a person continues until that individual¬ís physical liberty is ultimately restored. =8. Principle 8: State Responsibility to Protect upon Transfer= Transfer of a Person to the custody of another State does not terminate the transferring State¬ís responsibility to protect the rights of the transferee. The transferring State should maintain an active interest in the rights of the transferee and seek periodic assurances that due process rights are continuously afforded until the transferee¬ís physical liberty is ultimately restored. D. Section D: International Obligation =9. Principle 9: Statement of Universal Concern= A State's compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of persons it deprives of physical liberty is a concern of humankind and therefore should be of interest to all members of the international community. E. Section E: Relationship to Other Laws =10. Principle 10: Rules of Construction= These Principles should not be construed to diminish any human right or protection afforded by any other source of law. II. Part II: Procedural Due Process A. Section A: General Statement of Procedural Rights =11. Principle 11: Right to Procedural Due Process= Procedural due process is a human right requiring that all persons be afforded notice of, and an opportunity to challenge, any State action substantially affecting their fundamental right to physical liberty in a fair and public hearing before an impartial adjudicator with the independent authority to remedy violations through direct action and without undue restrictions. =12. Principle 12: Prohibition of Extralegal Arrest and Detention= Due process requires that no deprivation of liberty occur outside of a legal process designed and equipped to assess the legality of the deprivation before, after, and during the period of detention. =13. Principle 13: Prohibition of Extralegal Rendition= No State should subject any person to nonconsensual transfer from one national jurisdiction to another unless such transfer is performed pursuant to judicial process. B. Section B: Notice =14. Principle 14: Notice of Reasons for Deprivation and Procedural Rights= When a State substantially impairs the right to physical liberty of any person it should provide that person with effective written notice of the reasons for the impairment and the procedural mechanisms through which the person may challenge the deprivation. =15. Principle 15: Sufficiency of Notice= The required notice should be sufficient to inform the person of the laws authorizing the impairment and the nature of the evidence justifying its use in the specific case, described with sufficient particularity to allow the person to evaluate the factual and legal basis for the deprivation. If full disclosure of the evidence underlying the factual basis for the detention would result in a substantial risk of harm to individuals or national security, the detainee may be informed of the general nature of the State¬ís justification for the detention sufficient to allow the detainee to communicate relevant information to the detaining authorities which might assist them in determining whether continued detention is justified. C. Section C: Opportunity to be Heard =16. Principle 16: Right to Challenge Substantial Deprivations= All persons should have the right to challenge any substantial State deprivations of their right to physical liberty before a fair and impartial decision maker with the authority to remedy undue infringements without unnecessary delay. =17. Principle 17: Right to Presumption of Innocence in Criminal Hearings= All persons charged with a criminal offense should be presumed innocent until proven guilty through an adjudicative process conducted in accordance with the requirements of due process. =18. Principle 18: Right to Participate in Legal Process= All persons should be afforded the opportunity to participate in legal proceedings adjudicating matters directly affecting their right to physical liberty. =19. Principle 19: Right to Counsel= All persons should be afforded the opportunity to consult legal counsel before and during legal proceedings adjudicating matters pertaining to substantial deprivations of their right to physical liberty. D. Section D: Fair and Impartial Decision Maker =20. Principle 20: Composition of Adjudicative Mechanism= Decision makers charged with adjudicating matters affecting a person's fundamental rights should be impartial and adequately educated to properly perform that function. =21. Principle 21: Right of Adjudicators to Report Suspected Abuses= Adjudicators should have the means to report their concerns regarding suspected rights violations to appropriate authorities outside of the control of the governmental entity suspected of committing the violations. III. Part III: Substantive Due Process A. Section A: General Statement of Substantive Rights =22. Principle 22: Right to Substantive Due Process= Implicit in the fundamental right to due process of law is the requirement that no State should deprive any person of life, liberty, or security of person in violation of any right fundamental to accepted principles of global justice. B. Section B: Prohibition of Arbitrary Deprivations of Physical Liberty =23. Principle 23: Prohibition of Arbitrary Arrest and Detention= No State should arrest or detain any person for reasons that are arbitrary. An arrest or detention is arbitrary if it is not performed pursuant to law or if it is incompatible with the fundamental principles of global justice. =24. Principle 24: Right to the Rule of Law= No person should be deprived of the right to physical liberty except pursuant to the rule of law. State actors should never deprive any person of physical liberty except pursuant to specific and demonstrable legal authority governed by written laws and procedures. =25. Principle 25: Prohibition of Detention Based on the Exercise of Fundamental Rights= No State should detain any person based solely on that person¬ís exercise of a fundamental human right. =26. Principle 26: Prohibition of Detention Based on Discriminatory Animus= No State should detain any person based solely on that person¬ís nationality, national origin, ethnic origin, race, color, descent, language, religion, faith, sex, age, birth, parentage, wealth, or any similar criteria. =27. Principle 27: Prohibition of Ex Post Facto Application of Penal Law= No State should try any person for a penal offense based on acts or omissions which did not constitute a penal offense at the time they were committed. =28. Principle 28: Prohibition of Double Jeopardy= No State should detain, try, or punish any person for an offence for which the person has already been finally convicted or acquitted. =29. Principle 29: Prohibition of Deprivations Based on the Actions of Third Parties= No State should deprive any person of liberty based solely on the alleged or actual wrongdoing of a third party. =30. Principle 30: Prohibition of Indefinite Non-Punitive Detention= Extrajudicial detention beyond the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective is inconsistent with the principles of due process. No State should detain any person outside the judicial process unless such detention is conducted in accordance with substantial procedural safeguards narrowly tailored to ensure the detention is strictly limited to the time necessary to serve a compelling and current state objective. =31. Principle 31: Right to Repatriation Following Detention= All persons should be afforded the right to return to their country of nationality or citizenship upon the cessation of detention by a foreign State. C. Section C: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention =32. Principle 32: Prohibition of Incommunicado Detention= Prolonged incommunicado detention is incompatible with the substantive liberty guarantees inherent in the fundamental right to due process of law. =33. Principle 33: Right to Communicate with Relatives= Persons subjected to prolonged detention should be allowed to communicate with their family at regular intervals, subject to the supervision of the detaining authorities, unless the State demonstrates that the denial of such communication is necessary based on a demonstrable risk to national security or the safety of any person. =34. Principle 34: Right to Communicate with Diplomatic or Consular Representatives= All persons deprived of their liberty by the government of a foreign State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic or consular representatives of their home State as soon as practicable after the deprivation and periodically throughout the period of detention as needed to ensure they are afforded the full benefits of the protections guaranteed to foreign nationals under international law. All persons who are refugees, stateless persons, or nationals of States without diplomatic or consular representation in the detaining State should be allowed reasonable opportunities to communicate with the diplomatic and consular representatives of the State which takes charge of their interests or any national or international authority whose task it is to protect such persons. =35. Principle 35: Right to Unmonitored Communication with Physicians= All persons subjected to prolonged deprivations of liberty should be afforded the right to periodic unmonitored communications with the physicians charged with providing their medical care in order to allow the disclosure of allegations of abuse by the detaining authorities. =36. Principle 36: Right of Physicians to Report Suspected Rights Violations= Physicians charged with providing medical care for persons deprived of their liberty should be afforded a mechanism for disclosure of suspected detainee abuse to an authority outside the control of the entity committing the abuse, under conditions affording the physician adequate protection against retribution. =37. Principle 37: Right to Information about the Outside World= All persons deprived of their liberty for an extended time should be given regular access to periodicals, books, educational materials, audio programs, writing materials, and other such items intended to keep them mentally engaged, informed of world events, and to allow them to make productive use of their time while in detention. =38. Principle 38: Right of Public Access to Facility Procedures= A detaining State should make the general procedures governing the operation of its detention facilities available to the public. Sensitive security information may be exempted from public disclosure, although such procedures should be subject to review through an independent mechanism within the detaining government. =39. Principle 39: Rights of Relief Organizations to Inspect Prisoners and Facilities= No State should unduly restrict the ability of the International Committee of the Red Cross and other appropriate relief organizations to inspect detention facilities and to engage in unmonitored communication with individual detainees for the purpose of monitoring the State¬ís compliance with its responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of detainees under its control. D. Section D: Prohibition of Offenses to Personal Welfare and Human Dignity =40. Principle 40: Prohibition of Grave Breaches= No State should subject any person to torture, cruel treatment, biological experiments, murder, mutilation, maiming, rape, sexual abuse, or the intentional infliction of serious bodily or psychological injury. =41. Principle 41: Prohibition of Extra-Legal Interrogation Methods= No State should interrogate any person employing methods that have not been approved for use by law. =42. Principle 42: Duty to Maintain Records of Physical Interrogations= A State employing physical interrogation methods on any person should be required to maintain records detailing the specific dates, times, and duration of each physical interrogation session and specifying all of the physical methods employed together with the written legal authorization approving their use. Such records should be maintained for a period of fifty years, and destruction of such records should be a criminal offense. =43.

The cocktail shares a name with Hemingway's book Death in the Afternoon, and the recipe was published in So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon, 1935 cocktail book with contributions from famous authors. Hemingway's original instructions were: > \\"Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until > it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these > slowly.\\" It is claimed that the cocktail was invented by Hemingway after he spent time in the Left Bank, Paris, and enjoyed the absinthe there. The original printed recipe for the drink claimed that it was invented \\"by the author and three officers of H.M.S. Danae after having spent seven hours overboard trying to get Capt. Bra Saunders‚Äô fishing boat off a bank where she had gone with us in a N.W. gale.\\" Death in the Afternoon is known for both its decadence and its high strength. There are a number of alternative ways to produce Death in the Afternoon. The absinthe can be added to the glass after the Champagne, as some brands of absinthe will float on the Champagne for a short time. Other alternatives have arisen because of the difficulty of acquiring absinthe; the absinthe can be replaced with Absente, an alternative to absinthe available where it is illegal, or a strong pastis, such as Pernod. Variants which use an alternative to absinthe are sometimes given a different name, but are also sometimes still referred to as Death in the Afternoon. Some recipes direct the person making the cocktail to use ingredients in addition to the Champagne and absinthe; Valerie Mellma recommends that a sugar cube and several dashes of bitters be added to the glass prior to the main ingredients. The cocktail is milky in appearance on account of the spontaneous emulsification of the absinthe (or substitute), and bubbly, which it takes from the Champagne. After the first sip, however, it becomes significantly less bubbly. Harold McGee, dining and wine writer for The New York Times, said that it \\"seemed a waste of effervescence\\" (though substituting Pernod for the absinthe).

Plot Rex has Jack and Gwen board a plane headed to Washington, D.C., with fellow CIA agent Lyn Peterfield escorting them. However, Gwen's husband Rhys and their daughter Anwen are forced to stay in the UK. Back in Washington, D.C., because no one can die due to the Miracle, Dr. Vera Juarez has her hospital staff focus on treating the least wounded first so they can get them out quickly and have enough beds to treat newer patients. After his release, Oswald is being interviewed on a local talk show but doesn't say much since there is a campaign to have him returned to prison and anything he might say might be used against him. But when the reporter shows him a picture of the girl he murdered, Oswald starts to break down and cries, apologising to the girl and revealing he was too scared to apologise to the victim's mother, which earns him sympathy from some viewers. As he's about to leave the TV station, PR agent Jilly Kitzinger congratulates him on his interview and offers to be his agent but he declines, after which a TV staffer tells Oswald that Oprah Winfrey wants to do an interview with him. Meanwhile, Vera attends a medical conference where doctors are trying to figure out the Miracle. When a doctor tweets that his hospital needs more antibiotics, Vera realises because nobody is dying, people who were supposed to die have become living incubators for bacteria which allows them to grow and become resistant to antibiotics. What's worse, the Miracle is not true immortality as people still age and grow old. With fears that supplies will dwindle as the undying grows, Vera suggests that hospitals need more painkillers to handle this situation. Later, Vera meets Jilly who actually works for a pharmaceutical company called PhiCorp and convinces Vera that they can work together as she can help her. When Director Brian Friedkin suspects Esther and Rex may know too much about Torchwood, he has their security clearances deleted, frames them as spies working for China and orders Lyn to kill Jack with an arsenic pill. However, Esther manages to escape before the CIA catches her and tries to warn Rex. Back on the plane, Jack realises that he's being poisoned, at which point both Gwen and Rex apprehend Lyn. As Jack is slowly being killed by the arsenic, Rex calls Vera for help. With the help of her fellow doctors at the medical conference and the air stewards on their plane, Rex and Gwen successfully create an antidote and administer it to Jack. When Jack, Gwen, Rex and Lyn arrive at the airport, they are met by a group of CIA agents, unaware that they are under orders by Friedkin to arrest the three and free Lyn. Esther manages to warn Rex at which point he, Jack and Gwen subdue the agents and escape. During the fight Rex twists Lyn's head and breaks her neck. When the three exit the airport, they are greeted by Vera with Rex's painkillers, and Esther, who is their getaway driver. They are about to leave when Lyn, still alive but with her head twisted around 180 degrees, appears in front of them. She is unable to stop them due to her condition, and they are able to drive off.

The first (1947‚Äì49) proposed the creation of a General Council of the Press to govern behaviour, promote consumer interests and conduct research into the long-term social and economic impact of the print industry. This led to the setting up of the Press Council in 1953. The second Royal Commission (1961‚Äì62) studied the economic and financial factors that affecting the Press whilst the third (1974‚Äì77) proposed the development of a written Code of Practice for newspapers. 1947‚Äì49 Background The first Royal Commission on the Press was established in 1947 \\"with the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through the Press and the greatest practicable accuracy in the presentation of news, to inquire into the control, management and ownership of the newspaper and periodical Press and the news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, and to make recommendations thereon.\\" The Commission was founded amidst public concern that a concentration of ownership was inhibiting free expression, leading to factual inaccuracies and allowing advertisers to influence editorial content. According to the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) such changes had led to ‚Äòa progressive decline in the calibre of editors and in the quality of British journalism‚Äô. On 29 October 1946 two NUJ representatives proposed to the House of Commons that the setting up of a Royal Commission would be the most suitable way to investigate.His Majesty‚Äôs Stationery Office (HMSO), Cmd. 7700, Royal Commission on the Press, 1947-49: Report (1949), p. 3. The decision to launch an enquiry was taken after the House of Commons voted in favour of the NUJ's proposals by 270 votes to 157. The members of the Commission were appointed by Royal Warrant on 14 April 1947 with Sir William David Ross ‚Äì the Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford and fellow of the British Academy ‚Äì chosen as chairman. The other members were Ernest Darwin, Baron Simon of Wythenshawe, Sir Charles Geoffrey Vickers, Sir George Alexander Waters, George Malcolm Young, Hubert Hull, John Benstead, Eirwen Mary Owen, Melbourn Evans Aubrey, Neil Scobie Beaton, Lady Violet Bonham-Carter, Robert Charles Kirkwood Ensor, John Boynton Priestley, Wright Robinson, Gilbert Granville Sharp, Reginald Holmes Wilson, and Barbara Frances Wootton. The secretary, a civil servant, was chosen as Jean Nunn. Process The Royal Commission considered the evidence of 182 witnesses and responses to a series of questionnaires. It held 61 meetings and a further 62 were held by various subcommittees. During this process 106 newspaper proprietors gave oral evidence alongside representatives from 432 newspapers, three news agencies, and the Treasury.His Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO), Cmd. 7700, Royal Commission on the Press, 1947-49: Report (1949), p. 1. This evidence was eventually drawn into a 363 page report (HMSO, Cmd. 7700) and much was published in series of verbatim testimonies released as command papers throughout 1949. These are listed in the Commission's Index to Minutes of Oral Evidence (Cmd. 7690). The Commission‚Äôs evidence is now held in The National Archives. Findings The first Royal Commission focussed predominantly on newspapers and allegations of their inaccuracy and political bias. The Commission‚Äôs report agreed that the presentation of news often left much to be desired and that there was an inherent partisanship and political bias within much reporting. It was particularly critical of newspaper owners for offering an overly simplistic account of events rather than trying to educate their readers.His Majesty‚Äôs Stationery Office (HMSO), Cmd. 7700, Royal Commission on the Press, 1947-49: Report (1949), p.152. However the Commission did not believe that the United Kingdom's media could be characterized as being a monopoly and dismissed claims that advertisers had undue influence.His Majesty‚Äôs Stationery Office (HMSO), Cmd. 7700, Royal Commission on the Press, 1947-49: Report (1949), pp. 149 and 175. Most significantly it also rejected the idea that any weaknesses could be resolved solely by greater state intervention.His Majesty‚Äôs Stationery Office (HMSO), Cmd. 7700, Royal Commission on the Press, 1947-49: Report (1949), p. 170 Recommendations The Royal Commission's main recommendation was for industrial self-regulation through the establishment of a \\"General Council of the Press\\" which would act as a watchdog on irresponsible journalism and contribute to the \\"freedom and prestige of the Press\\" by speaking with a unified voice on its behalf. It argued that such a framework was necessary, \\"not to safeguard its own liberty, as many Press Union delegates continued to advocate, but to 'save the press from itself'\\". The recommendation led to the setting up of the Press Council in 1953. 1961‚Äì62 The second Royal Commission on the Press was established \\"to examine the economic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in the United Kingdom, including (a) manufacturing, printing, distribution and other costs, (b) efficiency of production, and (c) advertising and other revenue, including any revenue derived from interests in television; to consider whether these factors tend to diminish diversity of ownership and control or the number or variety of such publications, having regard to the importance, in the public interest, of the accurate presentation of news and the free expression of opinion.\\" This Commission was not concerned with the performance of the Press or with general ethical questions. The members of the commission were appointed by Royal Warrant on 4 March 1961. Lord Shawcross was appointed chairman, with Sir Graham Cunningham, Robert Browning, William Brian Reddaway, and William James Percival Webber as the other members. The main archive for the Commission is The National Archives. The final report of the Commission was presented to Parliament on 5 September 1962 as a command paper (Cmnd 1811) and the minutes of oral and written evidence are published as Command Papers 1812 and 1812-1 to 1812-9. By the time of this Commission. the Press Council had been subject to considerable criticism. The Commission's report demanded improvement, particularly the inclusion of lay members. 1974‚Äì77 The third Royal Commission on the Press was established \\"To inquire into the factors affecting the maintenance of the independence, diversity and editorial standards of newspapers and periodicals and the public freedom of choice of newspapers and periodicals, nationally, regionally and locally.\\" The Commission was set up in May 1974. Members of the Commission were appointed by Royal Warrant on 16 July 1974. Sir Morris Finer was appointed chairman: after his death the same year Professor Oliver McGregor was appointed chairman on 7 March 1975. The main archive for the Commission is the British Library of Political and Economic Science. The Commission chair proposed the development of a written Code of Practice, saying \\"it is unhappily certain that the Council has so far failed to persuade the knowledgeable public that it deals satisfactorily with complaints against newspapers\\" The Press Council rejected this proposal. In 1980, the National Union of Journalists withdrew from membership on the grounds that the Council was incapable of reform.

Sparkwell is a small village just outside Plymouth, in the county of Devon, England. Set up In 1942 a rest camp for Naval personnel was set up in Tin Wood, an area of woodland immediately south of the village of Sparkwell, beside the Sparkwell Golf Course. The village was dominated by the camp with their loudspeaker system could be heard echoing through the wood and the village day and night. The Naval camp was commanded by Lieutenant Whitworth and was primarily intended to provide a place of rest and recuperation for the survivors of ships that had been sunk by enemy action. When this rest was over, these men would be sent back to fight again on different ships. The Naval camp consisted of 20 Nissen-type huts for the soldiers' living quarters, a NAAFI (Navy, Army and Air Force Institute) canteen which was also used as a cinema and sometimes a dance hall as well as a sick bay with a morgue. Main track in Tin Wood Impact on the community The cinema was open to the Sparkwell villagers at no cost and it would provide a very welcome diversion for them. The increase of many young men into the community affected the residents, especially the eligible young female population. Also, the takings behind the bar at the Treby Arms had a dramatic increase. New arrivals In 1943, American soldiers arrived. These men were billeted in tents on the lawns of Hemerdon House. During this year, Sparkwell became a hive of activity after three years of relative inactivity. Hemerdon is a small village bordering Sparkwell on the Plympton side. There, the pub The Miners Arms is situated. Community development The Sparkwell Branch (a local organisation in Sparkwell) started to organise various dances and socials at which the new local band called the Sparklets were eager to play at. The Sparklets consisted of four members - John \\"Jumper\\" Collins (banjo), Harold Reed (drums), Percy Bickam (violin) and Miss May Blathford (piano). The American soldiers soon outnumbered the sailors at the Tin Wood (Beechwood) camp in attendance. The 1943 St. Valentine dance made a huge profit of ¬£7.15s.0d from entry fees of just 1s.6d. The end As the year of 1944 dawned, the tide of the war was beginning to turn in the favour of the Allies. Life in Sparkwell continued quite happily, intertwined with the lives of the British and foreign troops billeted in and around the parish. The dances, socials and cinema shows still proved popular. Rumours of the \\"2nd Front\\" were being spread abroad. In late May early June, large numbers of American military vehicles moved into the parish. Many roads and lanes were soon full with a wide variety of war vehicles. Suddenly on the 5‚Äì6 June 1944, the military presence disappeared. There were no more vehicles, no more troops, no loudspeaker announcements. It was D-Day (6 June 1944). The demolition firm of L.J Stephenson came to remove the Nissen huts, leaving only their concrete bases. Life in Tin Wood today Today in Tin Wood, the concrete bases of the Nissen huts can still be seen, although nearly all are now concealed in the dense overgrowth. The wood is used mainly by walkers and riders. Only the concrete bases remain of the secret Naval Base in Tin Wood. Evidence of the camp can still be seen as the stone and gravel paths are visible in some parts, but most of them are obscured.

A portrait of Douglas appears in the medallion, supported on a plinth by a figure of Justice. The plinth bears two medallion portraits of the Lords Mansfield and Camden, who were judges in the case. At the foot of the plinth, trampled underfoot, lies the figure of Deceit, holding a mask. The Douglas Cause was a cause c√©l√®bre and legal struggle contested in Great Britain during the 1760s. The main parties were Archibald Douglas (1748‚Äì1827) and James Douglas-Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton (1755‚Äì1769). The affair gripped the nation, leading to death threats and rioting. Background Archibald Douglas, 3rd Marquess and 1st Duke of Douglas (1694‚Äì1761) owned vast tracts of land and perhaps the greatest fortune in Scotland, but was otherwise undistinguished. He had been raised to the dukedom by Queen Anne in 1703 at the age of nine in order to secure the loyalty of the powerful Douglas family to her new regime. The duke was virtually illiterate and took no part in the affairs of the nation. He lived largely as a recluse and may have suffered from insanity. The duke remained unmarried until late in life and had no issue. His sister Lady Jane Douglas (1698‚Äì1753) was his putative heir. In the event of her remaining childless, most of the duke‚Äôs fortune along with a string of titles and ancient honours would pass to his kinsmen, the Dukes of Hamilton, who were descended in the male line from William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas. Until 1748, all looked set fair for the Hamiltons. The duke was unmarried, and although in 1746 Lady Jane had secretly married the unsuitable Colonel John Stewart, a penniless soldier of fortune, she was by then aged 48, and Colonel Stewart (described by the duke as a 'wore-out old rake') was 60. The marriage seemed unlikely to produce children. Following their marriage, Colonel and Lady Jane Stewart travelled to the Continent to escape their creditors under the assumed name of \\"Gray\\". Two years later in the summer of 1748, Lady Jane admitted the marriage and gave out that she was heavily pregnant. It was subsequently reported that on 10 July at the house of Madame Le Brun in Faubourg Saint-Germain in Paris, she had given birth to twin sons ‚Äì Archibald and Sholto. Lady Jane was 50 years old. Encouraged by the Hamiltons, the duke refused to recognise the boys as his sister‚Äôs children and his heirs. He cut off her allowance and when the couple returned to Britain in 1751, Stewart was imprisoned for debt. Lady Jane and her son Sholto both died in 1753, and the young Archibald ended up in the care of his kinsman, Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry, who saw to his education. In 1758, to general astonishment, the Duke of Douglas, then aged 63, married Margaret Douglas, a middle-aged distant relative. The Duchess of Douglas made it the main business of her remaining lifetime to redress the wrong done to Lady Jane. She prevailed upon the duke to investigate the circumstances of the case for himself, which he did at much expense and pains. In the end he was satisfied, expressed passionate remorse and revoked the existing entail of his estates, settling them upon Archibald Stewart in July 1761. Ten days later, the duke died. While the Dukedom of Douglas expired along with the duke, the Marquessate of Douglas and the ancient Earldom of Angus devolved upon his nearest heir male, the six-year old James Douglas-Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton. However, the duke‚Äôs castles, properties and extensive lands in eight Scottish counties, passed to Archibald Stewart, then 13 years old. Stewart legally changed his surname to Douglas and duly entered into his inheritance, worth the remarkable sum of ¬£12,000 per annum. Litigation Douglas Castle, part of the inheritance contested between the parties. With so much at stake, it was unsurprising that the Hamiltons contested the settlement. They dispatched Andrew Stuart of Torrance, a 'shady investigator', to Paris to investigate. He came back with the information that Archibald Douglas had been born ‚ÄòJacques Louis Mignon‚Äô, the son of a glass worker, and had been kidnapped in July 1748 by ‚Äòa lady, a gentleman and their maid‚Äô. He further claimed that the deceased Sholto Stewart was the son of ‚ÄòSanry the Rope Dancer‚Äô, who had vanished in similar circumstances. Stuart also reported that witnesses to Lady Jane‚Äôs pregnancy could not be found, and that the couple had not stayed where they said they had. In 1762, the Hamiltons launched an action in the Court of Session in Edinburgh claiming that Archibald Douglas‚Äôs identity had been fabricated and that he had no legal right to the Douglas inheritance. By 1767, each side had published memorials ‚Äì 1,000 page statements of case, which incorporated letters, documents, witness reports, affidavits and citations of Scots and French law. A total of 24 lawyers read speeches to the 15 judges before whom the case was heard. The hearings lasted 21 days, making it the longest ever pleading before the Court of Session. For the legal profession, the case was a bonanza, eventually racking up costs estimated at ¬£100,000. There was immense public interest in the case throughout Europe, and everyone held an opinion. David Hume, Adam Smith and Dr Johnson all supported Hamilton. Johnson‚Äôs biographer, James Boswell, disagreed and became a propagandist for Douglas, producing more than twenty articles and three books on the subject. The Edinburgh populace were also firmly on the side of Douglas, no doubt resentful at the prospect of Hamilton acquiring a second ducal fortune. On 14 July 1767, the court gave its opinion. The lords of session were split down the middle, seven in favour of Hamilton and seven for Douglas. The Lord President, Robert Dundas, gave his casting vote in favour of Hamilton. As one contemporary observer, lawyer Robert Stewart wrote, ‚Äòpoor Douglas lost his cause yesterday by the president‚Äôs casting vote, leaving him without father or mother, sister or brother or any relation on Earth for the evidence on which he is condemned does not give him in law other parents‚Äô. The court's judgement was so unpopular that the president's life was threatened. Douglas‚Äôs lawyers immediately launched an appeal to the House of Lords in London. The case opened in January 1769 and lasted more than a month. A reputed ¬£100,000 worth of bets were waged on the outcome. During its progress, the Hamiltons‚Äô investigator Andrew Stuart, challenged one of Douglas‚Äôs lawyers Edward Thurlow to a duel for calling him a liar. Pistols were fired but both missed. The verdict, when it was finally delivered in February 1769, was unanimously in favour of Archibald Douglas. Edinburgh went wild with joy. Mobs smashed the windows of the lords of session who had opposed Douglas, and plundered the Hamilton apartments in Holyroodhouse. For two days it was dangerous for opponents of Archibald Douglas to be in Edinburgh, and the military had to be called out to restore calm. Aftermath Six years after the decision in 1775, Andrew Stuart published Letters to the Right Honourable Lord Mansfield. In these epistles, Stuart assailed the Earl of Mansfield, a judge in the case who had supported the claims of Douglas, for his want of impartiality. The force and eloquence of Stuart‚Äôs writing was compared at the time to that of Junius. Archibald Douglas became one of the richest magnates in Scotland, but memories of the scandal lingered about him. It is noteworthy that he was not immediately ennobled as a high ranking peer, as might have been expected for someone of his wealth and family influence. It was not until 1790 that he was raised to the lowest rank of the peerage as Baron Douglas of Douglas. In popular culture and literature The scandal was the subject of a book by Percy FitzGerald entitled Lady Jean, The Romance of the Great Douglas Cause, published by Fisher Unwin in 1904. The events of the case are recounted in the 1971 play The Douglas Cause by William Douglas Home. Home was himself a direct descendant of Archibald Douglas.

Timorex Gold is effective against a wide range of plant-pathogenic fungi, including Oomycetes, Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycota, on numerous crops, including vegetables, herbs, grapevines, fruit trees, and banana. Timorex Gold has demonstrated high efficacy against Black Sigatoka (Black leaf streak disease in banana). Plants damaged by Black Sigatoka have a significant reduction in the photosynthesizing area of the leaf, and fruit yield losses can reach 50% through premature maturation. Black Sigatoka is caused by Mycosphaerella fijiensis (Morelet), and is considered the most damaging and costly disease of commercial banana and plantain. It originated in the Pacific region, was reported in Fiji in 1963, and since then has reached other banana producing countries. Control of this disease may require as many as 70 treatments per year using synthetic fungicides. Timorex Gold's special formulation contains multiple components, mostly terpenes and their alcohols, which have been proven antiseptic, fungicide and bactericide properties. The unique and powerful potential of this plant extract is highly effective for control in agricultural crops while significantly reducing the chemical risk to operators and the environment. History In 2003, scientists at Biomor, s member of the Stockton Group Research and Development Innovation Center, commenced research on the use of Melaleuca alternifolia in agriculture for the management and control of bacterial and fungal diseases. Studies dealing with non-plant pathogens confirmed that the fungicidal and anti-microbial activity of Melaleuca alternifolia resulted from its ability to disrupt the permeability barrier in membrane structures. In yeast cells and isolated mitochondria, Œ±-pinene and Œ≤-pinene, plant extract of \\"Melaleuca alternifolia\\" destroy cellular integrity, inhibit respiration and ion transport processes and increase membrane permeability. Timorex Gold has proven to be very effective against a broad spectrum of diseases found in vegetables, herbs, grapevines, bananas, and fruit trees. Registration The active substance of Timorex Gold was approved by the European Union to be included in the positive list of the EU, in Annex 1 of Directive 91/414/EEC for the registration of pesticides. Toxicology The active ingredient of Timorex Gold is a natural product that is classified as a low-risk substance for which Maximum Residue Limits (MRL) are not required in Europe. Stockton is in the process of obtaining similar exemptions in other areas of the world such as North America and Asia. Organic accreditation Timorex Gold is recognized to be a product that is used in both conventional and organic agriculture. Timorex Gold meets the requirements of European Union, NOP and JAS and is certified by the following entities: * Israeli Bio-Organic, Agriculture Association (I.B.O.A.A.) * International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM)) * BCS √ñko-Garantie * State of Israel Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Development * Control Union (CU) Certifications Category:Fungicides ","title":"Timorex Gold"},{"id":"32442400","title":"Mike Morasky"},{"id":"32442405","text":"Khalid Mohammed Abdulrahim ( Arabic :' ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸäŸÖ' ) is a Bahraini business magnate and construction tycoon is the founder and chairman of KAR group of companies.

Early life  Ramachandra Rao was born in Tanjore in 1825 in a Deshastha Brahmin family which traced its origins to Bijapur. After brief initial education, Ramachandra Rao moved to Madras in 1840 and caught the attention of Major Crisp, translator to the Madras government, who trained him in calculation and computation and employed Rao as his private writer from August 1840 to March 1841. Later, through Crisp's recommendation, Ramachandra Rao was appointed Superintendent of the Madras observatory.  Early career  In January 1844, Ramachandra Rao joined the Military Fund Office as a minute writer but switched over to the Police Department in October 1847. Ramachandra Rao's proficiency in multiple languages won him rapid promotions until 1854, when he was appointed Interpreter to the Chief Magistrate. Shortly afterwards, Rao was appointed Kannada translator to the Supreme Court of Madras with the backing of John Bruce Norton.  As Deputy Commissioner of Police  During the tenure of Charles Trevelyan as Governor of Madras, Ramachandra Rao was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Police with Boulderson as the Commissioner. Ramachandra Rao was the first Indian to serve in the post. As Deputy Commissioner, Ramachandra Rao successfully solved the case of a burglary in Adyar, the Dindigul Robbery Case and the Great Note Forgery Case of 1875. In 1875, he was in charge of the security arrangements during the visit of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) of India. Rao earned the praise of Prince Albert Edward and was personally presented a gold chain by him.  Later years  Ramachandra Rao retired in late 1878 due to failing health.

Tyrannosauropus was named for a collection of footprints discovered on the ceiling of a cave in Utah which were suggested to have been made by Tyrannosaurus and informally labelled as \\"Tyrannosauripus\\" in 1924 (not to be confused with the separate, later ichnogenus Tyrannosauripus).Peterson, W. (1924). Dinosaur tracks in the roofs of coal mines. Natural History, 24:388-391. These footprints would later be named by Haubold in 1971 as Tyrannosauropus petersoni, and attributed to Tyrannosaurus rex.Haubold, H. (1971). Ichnia Amphiborum et Reptiliorum Fossilium. Handbuch der Palaeoherpetologie Teil 18. Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart. 124 pp. However, Tyrannosauropus are Campanian in age, pre-dating the Maastrichtian age for Tyrannosaurus, and the morphology of the footprints more closely resembles those of hadrosaurid dinosaurs than those of theropods. Furthermore, in 1994 another footprint was described as likely belonging to Tyrannosaurus that matched it in both age and morphology and was named Tyrannosauripus. In the same publication, the description of Tyrannosauropus was deemed inadequate, with the holotype damaged and lost, and the ichnotaxon was declared undiagnostic and thus a nomen dubium.Lockley, M. G.; Hunt, A. P. (1994). A track of the giant theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus from close to the Cretaceous/Tertiary Boundary, northern New Mexico. Ichnos, 3(3): 213-218. In 1984, large tridactyl footprints discovered at the Lark Quarry trackway from the Winton Formation, Australia, were interpreted as most similar to Tyrannosauropus and were attributed to a large theropod trackmaker as cf. Tyrannosauropus. However, due to the likely hadrosaurid affinity of Tyrannosauropus, the identity of the cf. Tyrannosauropus track maker has been re-interpreted as a probable ornithopod, and suggested to belong to the ichnogenus Amblydactylus instead, itself likely made by the genus Muttaburrasaurus.

History The main visitors centre and collection building in the Botanical Garden The Exhibition Hall in the Visitors Centre, with a maquette of the island of Faial The entrance pergola to the open-air displays in the northern part of the garden The Jardim Bot√¢nico do Faial began operating in 1986, and since that time has had more than 100,000 visitors. In 1995 the Botanical Garden expanded its collection by including an area of Pedro Miguel, in the foothills of Lomba Grande. As part of its mission to promote investigation and education on the flora of the Azores and Macaronesia, it acquired 60,000 m¬≤ area in an area of 400 metres above sea level to replant and rehabilitate the habitat and species characteristic of the Laurisilva biome. In 2003, the garden administration began to create a seed bank to collect and maintain a viable gene pool of rare species common to the Azores. After remodelling and renovations, the Gardens were reopened on 22 May 2011, marking the International Day of Biodiversity, which included guided tours, a tea tasting (from Casa D'Avilas), a film on the Faial Nature Park and the presentation of a new website, Sentir e Interpretar os A√ßores, produced by the Regional Directorate for the Environment and Oceans (). As part of the commemorative programs to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Garden, the 9th Symposium of the Association of Ibero-Macaron√©sica Botanical Gardens was held in Horta. Part of the group's debates included discussion of the recuperation of landscapes deteriorated by invader species, as part of the regional programme PRECEFIAS (), which permitted the reclamation of 650 hectares in 24 areas of the area of the Azores. Geography The garden includes a couple of old farmhouses and land on the edge of an orange orchard of Quinta de S√£o Louren√ßo, in the civil parish of Flamengos. It occupies an area of approximately 8000 m¬≤, situated along the road that connects the southern part of Flamengos with Concei√ß√£o. Centre The function of the Botanical Gardens of Faial, apart from providing a natural landscape, is to preserve and maintain the collection of endemic plants common to the island of Faial and the Azores. This includes the conservation of seeds of various endemic species, the propagation of habitats of existing species and to promote an understanding of the rich floral diversity and historical importance to the islands.Juli Caujap√©-Castells et al. (June 2010) In the autonomous region there are records that indicate that 90% of the endemic plants common at the time of the early settlement have disappeared or were crossed with other species. The seed bank has been able to collect 28 of the 76 species of endemic plants (approximately one third). The interpretative centres attempt to educative, but also provide examples in a natural setting that fosters scientific investigation, referred to as ex-situ; species are taken from their natural locations and nurtured in a protected environment, where they can be seen, understood and investigated. Gardens The Garden is actually a series of spaces that show open-air examples of plants, trees and herbaceous species, as well as medicinal, aromatic and exotic ornamental plants, traditionally used on the islands. Specifically, the Garden is also a depository of some of the more rare plants in the Region, such as the Veronica Dabney. In the Il√≠dio Botelho da Costa herbarium, the visitor can encounter species native and exotic herbs, allowing the identification of uncommon species. In addition, there is an orquid√°rio (orchid garden), with examples of 30 different species of orchids collected by Henrique Peixoto (1917‚Äì2007), which were titled to the local Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia. The collection includes common and hybrid varieties of Cattleyas, Vandas, Lael, Gongora, Stanhopea, Milton, Epidendros, Dendrobii, among others, including a rare species from the island of Madagascar that contributed to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.The orchid, Angraecum sesquipedale, with a long 35 centimetre tube, allowed Darwin to presuppose the existence of a comparable insect with long probiscus that would allow the plant to be fertilized. The scientific community discreditted Darwin's theory, until the 1907 discovery of the Xanthopan morganii praedicta, which helped to support his theory of natural selection. Other important orchids include the Paphiopedilum and Phragmipedium families, which have fused sepals similar to a bag, that attract insects who fall into its flower. Forced to escape only through a narrow passage these insects are coated by pollen when they exit. The pollen is then transported to other plants which are pollenized. {style=\\"background: transparent; margin: auto;\\" |} References ;Notes ;Sources  *  External links  * Faial Botanical Garden: Sentir e Interpretar o Ambiente dos A√ßores Category:Botanical gardens in Portugal Category:Parks in the Azores Category:Horta, Azores ","title":"Botanical Garden of Faial"},{"id":"32442526","title":"Stuart ministry"},{"id":"32442529","text":"Caricature by Celso Herminio showing the Scottish mining engineer Robert Williams, a contract in his pocket, giving Portugal a railway line in Lobito. Angola railway network 1067mm gauge tracks, 610mm gauge tracks The history of rail transport in Angola began during the nineteenth century, when Angola was a colony of Portugal. It has involved the construction, operation and destruction of four separate, unconnected, coast-to-inland systems, in two different gauges. Operations on three of those systems have been largely restored; the other system has been closed. Beginnings Historic locomotive on Luanda railway line, Angola Plans to develop Angola by constructing railway lines existed from 1887. Two years later, the Luanda Railway () (Luanda‚ÄìViana‚ÄìLucala) was built and opened in the north of the colony, at the initiative of a private railway company. By 1909, that line had been extended eastwards to Malanje as a state railway. Later, a branch line was built from Zenza do Itombe to Dondo. The second significant line, the Mo√ß√¢medes Railway (Portuguese: ), was built as a state railway, in gauge. The Mo√ß√¢medes Railway connects the port city of Mo√ß√¢medes, in the south of the colony, with the inland town of Menongue. In 1910, the first section of this line was opened to traffic. Other sections were later built to Dongo and Cassinga before the line was completed to Menongue in 1961. A branch line was built from Lubango to Chiange, making Lubango one of Angola's few rail junctions. The Mo√ß√¢medes Railway was regauged to gauge in 1950. Benguela Railway The Benguela Railway (Portuguese: ) was completed in 1912, to link the two port cities of Lobito and Benguela with Huambo. This line, in central Angola, included an approximately long rack railway portion, with gradients of up to six percent. By 1929, the line had been extended to Dilolo, now in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to enable the copper deposits in the Congolese province of Katanga to be transported to the Atlantic ports. Together with other railway lines, this extended line yielded an almost continuous railway route to Dar es Salaam, in what was then Tanganyika. Only two sections on the route were required to be negotiated by ship. Later, it was possible to reach the Mozambican port of Beira by rail. The Benguela Railway proved to be most important railway line in Angola. Other colonial lines A fourth railway line to connect the Angolan inland with a port was built in 1925 to serve coffee plantations on Amboim plateau, in narrow gauge, and linked Porto Amboim with Gabela. Porto Amboim is on the coast between Luanda and Lobito. The Porto Amboim‚ÄìGabela line was managed by the Luanda Railway. It was long and closed in 1975. Post independence On 11 November 1975, Angola became independent. By then, the Angolan civil war had already begun. The civil war lasted until 2002, and brought rail traffic in Angola almost to a standstill. As early as 1975, the Benguela Railway was no longer functional. Several lines, such as the Porto Amboim‚ÄìGabela line, were later closed down permanently. After the end of the civil war, the Angolan government turned to Chinese companies to rehabilitate the three main colonial-era railways. The Luanda Railway and the Benguela Railway were rebuilt by the state-owned China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, while the Mo√ß√¢medes Railway was rebuilt by a Chinese mining company.

The movie depicts the pain of separation of a couple from Kathmandu after the wife gets kidnapped while on a pilgrimage in the Himalaya, and the sufferings her husband goes through to get her back from her captors. The musical film is based on a ballad in Nepal Bhasa written in the early 19th century which describes a journey to Silu, the sacred lake known as Gosaikunda located in the Himalaya. There is a belief in Newar society that a husband and wife should not make the trip together as it could result in a misfortune.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992).

Bibliotheca Himalayica. Ratna Pustak Bhandar. Page 305. Plot Tuyu Maicha (Naveena Shrestha) makes a race with her friends at Swayambhu stairs. Hira (Jaya Shrestha) joins them and declares himself first when they reach to the top. This first meet make Hira fall in love with Tuyu Maicha but the girl doesn't like him and goes her own way. Hira tells about her to his uncle, Aashnara (Madan Krishna Shrestha) who assures him that he'll take care of everything once Hira finds out her home. Hira now starts following Tuyu Maicha. He finds her home, plays flute sitting in an inn in front of her house and also follows her to the stone spout. He sees an old man working in the girls house and approaches him with a proposal that he would provide him with clothes if he settles his matter with the girl. Turns out, the man working is actually the girl's father and he chases Hira away. Learning that the things have gone wrong, Hira asks for help with his uncle. During Indra Jatra, everyone attends the ceremony with joy. Hira meets Tuyu Maicha and gives her a flower but she turns her back. Later, Aashnara meets the girl's father and talk about her marriage with his nephew. The father immediately rejects the proposal remembering the previous incident with Hira. One day, when Hira is playing flute in the inn as usual, the girl's father calls everyone and beats Hira and breaks his flute. Hira pours his anger to Tuyu Maicha and tells her that, if needed, he'll steal her and marry. His friends comforts him and tells him to try another girl, but he replies that he would not want any angels from heaven but just Tuyu Maicha. One day, some street performer amuses people with a performing bear. Tuyu Maicha is there watching the performance. Seeing the red shawl of Tuyu Maicha, the bear chases her. She runs away in fear.

The girl's father still won't agree for their marriage. Hira gets to the inn in front of her house. From the window, Tuyu Maicha and her sister shows him a mirror. The sister pulls Tuyu Maicha's hair and tears the clothes on her back. Confused, Hira goes to his uncle and tells what happened. Uncle then tells him the symbolic meanings.

Someone suggests them that, husband and wife should consult an astrologer before going. Hira consults one, who says they should not go together. When the wife finds out about the plan, she insists on coming too. He reminds her of the tradition that it is not done, and that it could lead to their separation. Hira starts his journey with his friends, leaving behind his beloved wife. After going some distance, they meet Tuyu Maicha, who has been following them.

Commemoration of Carl Linnaeus has been ongoing for over two centuries. Celebrated for his scientific work, Linnaeus was knighted and granted nobility (as Carl von Linn√©) in life. After his death, he has been featured in sculpture, on postage stamps and banknotes, as well as by a medal from the eponymous Linnean Society of London. Several notable people have the given names Linnaeus/Linn√© (usually for boys) or Linnea/Linn√©a (highly popular for girls born in Scandinavia). Among other things named in his honor are plants, astronomical features, towns, an arboretum, a mineral and a university. Accolades By the end of his life in 1778, Carl Linnaeus had become one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe, the first commoner in Sweden to be dubbed a knight of the Order of the Polar Star (1753) and ennobled as Carl von Linn√© (1761).

A century later, celebrations of the bicentennial expanded globally and were even larger in Sweden. At Uppsala University, honorary doctorates were given to Ernst Haeckel, Francis Darwin and Selma Lagerl√∂f, among others. The memorials were so numerous that newspaper columnists began to tire of them and printed caricatures of the esteemed Linnaeus. In 1917, on the 210th anniversary of Linnaeus' birth, the Swedish Linnaeus Society was founded and proceeded to restore the Linnaean Garden, which had fallen into disrepair. In 2007, tricentennial celebrations were held. During that year a documentary titled Expedition Linn√© was produced, which was intended to increase public understanding of and respect for nature.

It is the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Canada and one of the world's biggest copper-gold porphyry deposits. Though 2P reserves are significant (39 million ounces of gold, 214 million ounces of silver, 9.9 billion pounds of copper and 257 million pounds of molybdenum) they only represent about 65% of the mine's total resource of each metal. The mines have a 52-year mine life (up from the 37 year estimate in 2009) and in the first seven years gold production costs are estimated to have been $105/oz.

A preliminary feasibility study released in May 2010 increased reserves by 61% for silver (133 million ounces), 42% for copper (7 billion pounds), 27% for gold (8.5 million ounces) and 22% for molybdenum; Most of the new reserves came from the Iron Cap portion of the property which wasn't part of previous development plans. Exploration spending in British Columbia was $521 million in 2008 and 2009 combined with spending in 2009 being the \\"6th highest total in the last 20 years\\". Besides KSM there were 87 other significant exploration projects in BC that year (60% of the companies involved were based in BC). In 2010 a comprehensive environmental assessment of the area was completed by Canada's ministry of environment. While the study was being done the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA) was undergoing a review of its own by the Supreme Court of Canada. KSM is located near the headwaters of a tributary of the Unuk River, which flows into Behm Canal near Ketchikan. Seabridge unveiled its development plan during a public meeting in Ketchikan in October 2011 before a crowd of skeptical residents.http://www.alaskapublic.org/2011/10/06/bc-coal-mine-plan-irks- ketchikan-residents/ Geology The sulphurets zone has the lowest elevations while the highest elevations of the entire valley region are covered by glaciers. The main sulfides are pyrite and chalcopyrite and all mineralization came from processes occurring deep below the surface (hypogene). Quartz stockwork is the main mineralization type. Kerr - Recognized as a porphyry copper deposit since 1987 (specifically a modified porphyry deposit with unique characteristics). A hydrothermal system generated by intrusion of monzonite, naturally upgraded mineral grades (caused by one of the many deformations occurring in its geological history). That deformation introduced new veins which consisted of a combination of sulfides occurring with minor chalcopyrite, bornite and quartz occurring with carbonate minerals and chlorite. Sulphurets - This deposit is centered on the Sulphurets Thrust Fault where volcanic activity helped to form it (portions previously exposed to fracturing form the site's gold zone). Copper can be found within the Main Copper Zone and the Raewyn Copper-Gold Zone. Gold is found in its highest concentrations at the Breccia Gold Zone (up to 5.6 g/t in the K-feldspar hydrothermal breccias and up to 21.2 g/t in the siliceous breccias). Currently (July 2011) it has 3 million ounces of inferred gold resource that Seabridge has an agenda to upgrade by 2012. At a depth between 42.9 m and 65.9 m, Sulphurets has a gold grade of 1.26 g/t (1.12 g/t beyond 79 m). Mitchell - The deposit was previously exposed through erosion of the Mitchell Thrust Fault. Copper-gold mineralization occurs mostly in a zone 300 to 600 meters thick. Glacial melting increased exposure of the deposit.

It is a serious ectoparasite of larger species of fish, particularly when they are injured. Description Aega psora is the type species of the genus Aega and was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It reaches in length and is mostly grey, with a faint dorsal stripe. It has slender mandibles and maxillae adapted for sucking blood and some of the setae (bristles) are hooked. The front three pairs of pereiopods (legs) cling on to its host, it inserts its mouthparts and blood is pumped rapidly into the gut. Other adaptations for this method of feeding include strong muscles in its oesophagus and large salivary glands. Distribution Aega psora is widespread throughout the North Atlantic Ocean and has been found in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Irish Sea. In the northwestern Atlantic it is found between the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod. Hosts Aega psora is a facultive parasite which temporarily attaches itself to its host and is able to survive independently. It probably spends the rest of the time resting on the seabed. It has been found as an external parasite on the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), a shark in the genus Squalus, the common skate (Raja batis), the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) and the barndoor skate (Dipturus laevis). Large numbers have also been found in the stomach of a Greenland shark, though whether living as a parasite or as a commensal is unclear. It was also found for the first time on the goldstripe sardinella (Sardinella gibbosa) off the coast of Egypt in 2007.

He studied at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York and Beaux-Arts, Avignon, France.  Early life  Before Benƒïs attended Pratt Institute, he lived with his grandparents in Brooklyn, New York. As a teenager he made the U.S. Olympic speed skating team, while smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. It became clear around 17 years old that Barton had a flair for the contradictory, and the romantic. He would often walk around the city bare foot saying ‚ÄúI thought it was romantic to be a pig‚Äù. Around this time in his life Benƒïs would sneak out and go to a mob-run gay bar named New Colony. While spending time there he was asked to complete an installation for customers to view. After being hired for his first piece he was given a job designing window installations for New Colony. While working for New Colony he met a man named Howard Meyer. Benƒïs and Howard soon moved in with each other and began their careers from home. Not soon after in 1969 Barton was contracted and put on his first exhibit ‚ÄúLeather and Lace‚Äù, a show involving him strapped naked to a padded leather table. He was then changed when he traveled to Africa to create his last painting. While in Africa his views of art evolved towards an obsession with Africa's tribal culture, artifacts, and erotica.  Mid Life  Following Benƒïs trip to Africa his work became increasingly more contradictory during the 70s and 80s. His art revolved around clever artistic puns (i.e. a book nailed shut in protest of freedom of speech). During this time his aunt Evelyn that was interested in the stories of Barton's life in New York would write letters. Fueled by Speed she would write letters ranging from 50 to 60 pages. Through which Barton would turn the letters in to small intricate books. While Benƒïs was using his Aunt as a prompt for his art, a hustler that was hired by Benƒïs began an affair with his lover Howard. Aunt Evelyn who had begun writing to Bartons friends, also began writing to the hustler Barton's lover Howard was having the affair with. During the affair the hustler responded to Aunt Evelyn informing her of what her letters were being used for. This led to a falling out between Benƒïs and his Aunt, she threatened to sue him then immediately stopped all communication with her Nephew. Later in life Benƒïs attempted to reconnect with his aunt but his efforts were not successful. In 1986 Howard Meyer was diagnosed with Kaposi's Sarcoma and Benƒïs with AIDS. The next few years after he was diagnosed, included the passing of a number of close friends. Three years afterwards Howard Meyers passed from his illness. This was the breaking point for Benƒïs he watched his lover pass. Barton says that ‚ÄúWhen he died‚Äîit‚Äôs crazy but true‚ÄîI saw the energy leave his body,‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd I got on top of him to grab the energy.‚Äù. For the first time since Benƒïs was diagnosed with AIDS he had an artistic impulse. Turning the emotions he was experiencing into an artistic experience. Benƒïs would begin to use his friends and their memories as mementos in his pieces. Benƒõs made \\"museums\\" somewhat in the style of Joseph Cornell, which incorporate into shadow boxes bits and pieces that reveal the myths and ironies of life. The fragments in Bene≈°'s museums often involve famous people and events, as do the sixteen collaged bits in this print, from a piece of Elizabeth Taylor's shoe to a crumb from the wedding cake of the Prince of Wales. On one evening in 1990 Barton cut his hand while preparing dinner. Being used to fact that his blood is toxic he rushed for bleach. Before retrieving the bleach however, he began to focus on the artistic where his blood contained a dualistic meaning. Responding to the experience he began a series of pieces titled ‚ÄúLethal Weapons‚Äù. A series of 8 different shadow boxes, each containing a different item, turned weapon with the use of syringes and Benƒïs signature twist his blood. During the first showing of his exhibit in 1990 his pieces were disinfected at 160 degrees in a hospital oven, in Lund, Sweden. Due to the extreme level of discomfort that the patrons were experiencing. After His diagnosis Barton became an advocate for the destigmatizing of AIDS. From 2003-2009 he served on the board of Visual AIDS. His artwork became a visual representation of AIDS and its history. He turned his life from a victim of the disease to a terrorist. He would inflict violence on a judgemental society. His works of art showing the lethality of a disease. Benƒïs finds the eroticism of his illness. He uses eroticism to cope with the world around him. When two of his friends died, as a tribute to the couple he placed both of their ashes into a hourglass. Forever binding his friends in death.  Late Life/Death  Bene≈°'s apartment in New York contained his collection of over $1 million worth of African, Egyptian, and contemporary art, as well as his own. After his death in 2012 the interior of his apartment, including his shadow box museums, was relocated and reconstructed at the North Dakota Museum of Art, under the supervision of his friend and colleague Laurel Reuter, director of the museum. The exhibit opened in late 2013 and is called Barton's Place.

It emerged from the bishops of Cetinje, later metropolitans, who defied Ottoman overlordship and transformed the parish of Cetinje to a de facto theocracy, ruling as Metropolitans (vladika, also rendered \\"Prince-bishop\\"). The history starts with Vavila, and the system was transformed into a hereditary one by Danilo ≈†ƒáepƒçeviƒá, a bishop of Cetinje who united the several tribes of Montenegro into fighting the Ottoman Empire that had occupied most of southeastern Europe. Danilo was the first of the House of Petroviƒá-Njego≈° to occupy the office as Metropolitan of Cetinje until 1851, when Montenegro became a secular state (principality) under Danilo I Petroviƒá-Njego≈°. It also became a brief monarchy when it was temporary abolished 1767‚Äì1773, during which impostor Little Stephen posed as Russian Emperor and crowned himself Lord of Montenegro. Name The state was virtually the Metropolitanate of Zeta under the supervision of the Petroviƒá-Njego≈° family. The name mostly used in historiography is \\"Metropolitanate of Cetinje\\" or \\"Cetinje Metropolitanate\\" (–¶–µ—Ç–∏—ö—Å–∫–∞ –º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—ò–∞). The highest office-holder of the polity was the Metropolitan (vladika, also rendered \\"prince-bishop\\"). Metropolitan Danilo I (1696‚Äì1735) called himself \\"Danil, Metropolitan of Cetinje, Njego≈°, Duke of the Serb land\\" (‚Äû–î–∞–Ω–∏–ª, –≤–ª–∞–¥–∏–∫–∞ —Ü–µ—Ç–∏—ö—Å–∫–∏, –ä–µ–≥–æ—à, –≤–æ—ò–µ–≤–æ–¥–∏—á —Å—Ä–ø—Å–∫–æ—ò –∑–µ–º—ô–∏...\\"). When Bjelopavliƒái and the rest of the Hills was joined into the state during the rule of Peter I, it was officially called \\"Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\" (–¶—Ä–Ω–∞ –ì–æ—Ä–∞ –∏ –ë—Ä–¥–∞). Travers Twiss used the English term \\"Prince- Bishopric of Montenegro\\", for the first time, in 1861. History The period of elective vladikas Vladikas were elected for 180 years by clan chieftains and people on Montenegrin assembly called Zbor, an arrangement that was ultimately abandoned in favor of the hereditary system. The very first of them, Vavila, had a relatively peaceful reign without many Ottoman incursions, devoting most of his time to maintenance of printing press on Obod. His successor, German II, was not so fortunate. Skenderbeg Crnojeviƒá, an islamized member of Crnojeviƒá family put forth his claim on Montenegro, and sought to capture it as an Ottoman vassal. Vukotiƒá, the civil governor of Montenegro, repulsed him, and such was the zeal of the Montenegrins for the Christian cause, that they marched into Bosnia and raised the siege of Jajce, where the Hungarian garrison was closely hemmed in by Ottoman troops. The Turks were too much occupied with the Hungarian war to take revenge, and it was not till 1570 that Montenegro had to face another Ottoman invasion. The next three vladikas, Paul, Nicodin, and Makarios, availed themselves of this long period of repose to increase the publications of the press, and numerous psalters and translations of the Gospels were produced in this small and remote Principality. In 1570, large-scale invasions were renewed. Montenegro faced two of them led by Ali-pasha of Shkod√´r, the first of which was repulsed, but the later took a heavy toll on its inhabitants. Pahomije, the prince-bishop at that moment, was unable to reach Ipek for the ceremony of consecration, and his authority was therefore weakened in the eyes of his people. The islamized renegades, allowed to settle in the country at the time of Stani≈°a's defeat, welcomed the Pasha's army with open arms, allowing him to seize the castle of Obod and destroy the precious printing-press, which Ivan Crnojeviƒá had established there a century earlier. During Pahomije's rule, Montenegrins fought in War of Cyprus on behalf of Republic of Venice. The next vladika, Rufim Njegu≈°, ruled from 1594 to 1631. He was noted as an exceptional military leader, aiding the Banat Uprising (1594) and defeating several Ottoman invasions of Montenegro - in 1604, 1612, and 1613. The first of them culminated in the Battle of Lje≈°kopolje (1604). Sanjak-bey of Shkod√´r Ali-bey Mimibegoviƒá led an army of 12,000 from Podgorica and clashed with 400 Montenegrins in Lje≈°anska nahija. Rufim reinforced them with 500 Katunjani during the day and sent dozens of small three-members groups, in total amount of 50 warriors to spy and to attack the opponent from rear. The battle lasted through whole night, when at the dawn Montenegrins launched a sudden charge surprising the enemy. Ali-beg was wounded and retreated with 3,500 casualties, while his second-in-command ≈†aban ƒÜehaja was killed. Eight years later, in 1612, the Sultan determined that he would sweep the defiant mountaineers off the face of the earth. An army of 25.000 men was despatched against the principality, The decisive battle took place not far from Podgorica. But the Turkish cavalry was useless in such a country. The small band of Montenegrins held their ground, the enemy threw himself against their rocks in vain, and the flower of the Ottoman cavalry was left dead on the field. Next year a still larger force of was collected by newly appointed Sanjak-bey of Shkod√´r Arslan-bey Baliƒáeviƒá to attack Montenegro. Bey split his forces in two, and tasked first army with penetration of Cetinje and second army with suppressing rebellious forces around Spu≈æ. Both armies failed, as the first one was stopped in Lje≈°kopolje again without reaching Cetinje, and the second one was defeated when Rufim personally led a side attack of 700 Katunjani to the aid of Piperi, Bjelopavliƒái and Rovƒçani forces which were already engaging enemy around the village of Kosov lug. Six months were occupied in skirmishes and ambuscades, and it was not till 10 September 1613, that the two armies met on the spot where Stani≈°a had been defeated more than a century before. The Montenegrins, although assisted by some neighbouring tribes, were completely outnumbered. Despite this, the Montenegrins decisively defeated the Turkish forces. Arslan-bey was wounded, and the heads of his second-in-command and a hundred other Turkish officers were carried off and stuck on the ramparts of Cetinje. The Ottoman troops fled in disorder; many were drowned in the waters of the Moraƒça, many more were killed by their pursuers. In 1623 Soliman, Pasha of Shkod√´r, with 80.000 men, marched into the country with the intention of finally annexing it. For twenty days the opposing forces were engaged in almost ceaseless conflicts. But the invaders at last reached Cetinje. The capital was taken, and the monastery of Ivan Crnojeviƒá sacked. A tribute was imposed upon those who submitted, while the resistance retired to the inaccessible heights of the Lovƒáen, and descended upon the Turkish camp. The Pasha realized that the bare rocks afforded no subsistence to his host; so, leaving a small army of occupation behind, he returned to the fertile plains of Albania. At once the Montenegrins attacked the Turkish garrisons, while the warlike tribes of the Kuƒçi and Klimenti on the Albanian border fell upon the main body which was returning to Shkod√´r, near Podgorica, and almost annihilated it. Montenegro was once more free. During rule of Mardarije I, Visarion I, and Mardarije II, Montenegrins actively fought in War of Candia (1645-1669) on the side of Venetians, while during rules of last four elective vladikas and the first hereditary one, they took part in Morean War (1684-1699). One of the most notable battles of that war in which Montenegro took part was the Battle of Herceg Novi in 1687, in which Venetians besieged the city from seaside, with Montenegrins doing the same from the land side. The total amount of Montenegrins which have fell was 1500, while only 170 Venetians were slain in battle. Montenegrins played a pivotal role in intercepting forces of Topal Pasha which were sent to lift the siege. A force of 300 Montenegrins ambushed the army of Topal Pasha, which numbered as much as 20.000 according to The Mountain Wreath, on the narrow pass in Kameno field and routed it. Danilo Danilo I of Montenegro During the reign of Danilo two important changes occurred in the wider European context of Montenegro: the expansion of the Ottoman state was gradually reversed, and Montenegro found in the Russian Empire a powerful new patron to replace the declining Venice. The replacement of Venice by Russia was especially significant, since it brought financial aid (after Danilo visited Peter the Great in 1715), modest territorial gain, and, in 1789, formal recognition by the Ottoman Porte of Montenegro's independence as a state under Petar I Petroviƒá Njego≈°. Sava and Vasilije Metropolitan Danilo was succeeded by Metropolitan Sava and Metropolitan Vasilije. Sava was predominantly occupied with clerical duties and did not enjoy as much charisma among tribal heads as his predecessor did. However, he managed to keep good relations with Russia, and to get considerable help from Peter the Great's successor empress Elizabeth. During his trip to Russia his deputy Vasilije Petroviƒá gained considerable respect among the tribes by giving support to those who at that time were attacked by the Ottomans. He was as much hated by the Venetians as he was by the Ottomans. Vasilije was also active in trying to solicit Russian support for Montenegro. For that purpose he traveled to Russia three times, where he also died in 1766. He also wrote one of the earliest historical books on Montenegro, History of Montenegro. ≈†ƒáepan Mali In 1766, a person known as ≈†ƒáepan Mali (\\"Stephen the Little\\") appeared in Montenegro, rumoured to be Russian Emperor Peter III, who in fact had been assassinated in 1762. Having affection for Russia, the Montenegrins accepted him as their Emperor (1768). Metropolitan Sava had told the people that ≈†ƒáepan was an ordinary crook, but the people believed him instead. Following this event ≈†ƒáepan put Sava under house arrest in the Stanjeviƒái monastery. ≈†ƒáepan was very cruel and thus both respected and feared. After realizing how much respect he commanded, and that only he could keep Montenegrins together, Russian diplomat Dolgoruki abandoned his efforts to discredit ≈†ƒáepan, even giving him financial support. In 1771 ≈†ƒáepan founded the permanent court composed of the most respected clan chiefs, and stubbornly insisted on respect of the court's decision. The importance of ≈†ƒáepan's personality in uniting Montenegrins was realized soon after his assassination conducted by order of Kara Mahmud Bushati, the pasha of Scutari. Montenegrin tribes once again engaged into blood feuding among themselves. Bushati tried to seize the opportunity and attacked Kuƒçi with 30,000 troops. For the first time since Metropolitan Danilo, the Kuƒçi were helped by Piperi and Bjelopavliƒái, and defeated the Ottomans twice in two years. Petar I After ≈†ƒáepan's death, gubernadur (title created by Metropolitan Danilo to appease Venetians) Jovan Radonjiƒá, with Venetian and Austrian help, tried to impose himself as the new ruler. However, after the death of Sava (1781), the Montenegrin chiefs chose archimandrite Petar Petroviƒá, who was a nephew of Metropolitan Vasilije, as successor. Petar I assumed the leadership of Montenegro at a very young age and during most difficult times. He ruled almost half a century, from 1782 to 1830. Petar I won many crucial victories against the Ottomans, including at Martiniƒái and Krusi in 1796. With these victories, Petar I liberated and consolidated control over the Highlands (Brda) that had been the focus of constant warfare, and also strengthened bonds with the Bay of Kotor, and consequently the aim to expand into the southern Adriatic coast. In 1806, as French Emperor Napoleon advanced toward the Bay of Kotor, Montenegro, aided by several Russian battalions and a fleet of Dmitry Senyavin, went to war against the invading French forces. Undefeated in Europe, Napoleon's army was however forced to withdraw after defeats at Cavtat and at Herceg-Novi. In 1807, the Russian‚ÄìFrench treaty ceded the Bay to France. The peace lasted less than seven years; in 1813, the Montenegrin army, with ammunition support from Russia and Britain, liberated the Bay from the French. An assembly held in Dobrota resolved to unite the Bay of Kotor with Montenegro. But at the Congress of Vienna, with Russian consent, the Bay was instead granted to Austria. In 1820, to the north of Montenegro, the Moraƒça tribe won a major battle against an Ottoman force from Bosnia. During his long rule, Petar strengthened the state by uniting the often quarreling tribes, consolidating his control over Montenegrin lands, and introducing the first laws in Montenegro. He had unquestioned moral authority strengthened by his military successes. His rule prepared Montenegro for the subsequent introduction of modern institutions of the state: taxes, schools and larger commercial enterprises. When he died, he was by popular sentiment proclaimed a saint. Petar II Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈°, Lord of Montenegro, poet and philosopher Following the death of Petar I, his 17-year-old nephew, Rade Petroviƒá became Metropolitan Petar II. By historian and literary consensus, Petar II, commonly called \\"Njego≈°\\", was the most impressive of the prince- bishops, having laid the foundation of the modern Montenegrin state and the subsequent Kingdom of Montenegro. He was also the most acclaimed Montenegrin poet. A long rivalry had existed between the Montenegrin metropolitans from the Petroviƒá family and the Radonjiƒá family, a leading clan which had long vied for power against the Petroviƒá's authority. This rivalry culminated in Petar II's era, though he came out victorious from this challenge and strengthened his grip on power by expelling many members of the Radonjiƒá family from Montenegro. In domestic affairs, Petar II was a reformer. He introduced the first taxes in 1833 against stiff opposition from many Montenegrins whose strong sense of individual and tribal freedom was fundamentally in conflict with the notion of mandatory payments to the central authority. He created a formal central government consisting of three bodies, the Senate, the Guardia and the Perjaniks. The Senate consisted of 12 representatives from the most influential Montenegrin families and performed executive and judicial as well as legislative functions of government. The 32-member Guardia traveled through the country as agents of the Senate, adjudicating disputes and otherwise administering law and order. The Perjaniks were a police force, reporting both to the Senate and directly to the Metropolitan. Before his death in 1851, Petar II named his nephew Danilo as his successor. He assigned him a tutor and sent him to Vienna, from where he continued his education in Russia. According to some historians Petar II most likely prepared Danilo to be a secular leader. However, when Petar II died, the Senate, under influence of Djordjije Petroviƒá (the wealthiest Montenegrin at the time), proclaimed Petar II's elder brother Pero as Prince and not Metropolitan. Nevertheless, in a brief struggle for power, Pero, who commanded the support of the Senate, lost to the much younger Danilo who had more support among the people. In 1852, Danilo proclaimed a secular Principality of Montenegro with himself as Prince and formally abolished ecclesiastical rule.Jovanovic 1947, p. 233 Aftermath In Danilo I's Code, dated to 1855, he explicitly states that he is the \\"knjaz (duke, prince) and gospodar (lord) of the Free Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\". The new Principality of Montenegro lasted until 1910, when Prince Nicholas I proclaimed the Kingdom of Montenegro.

The house is listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England. The gates, railings and wall to the grounds of the house are also individually Grade II listed. It was built in 1932 as the home and studio of portrait artist Frank O. Salisbury. The word Sarum is the old name for the town of Salisbury. The architect was Vyvyan Salisbury, his nephew. The artist's wife cut the first sod on the site, on 4 September 1932. They moved in on 4 July 1933. In his 1953 autobiography, also titled Sarum Chase., Salisbury wrote: > Telegraph Hill rises from the junction of Platt‚Äôs Lane and West Heath Road > to one of the highest points in Hampstead overlooking London, with a > wonderful view across country to the Chilterns. It was the place where the > beacon was lit to carry the tidings of the Spanish Armada. What a place for > a garden! What a situation for a House!

On his death in August 1962, Salisbury bequeathed the house in trust to the British Council of Churches. However, the BCC sold the mansion and auctioned its contents. On 7 June 1968, it was the setting of a photoshoot for The Rolling Stones, for their Beggars Banquet album, by photographer Michael Joseph. Previously unseen images from the shoot were exhibited at the Blink Gallery in London in November and December 2008. The house was also the setting for a low-budget horror-glamour 8mm short film, Miss Frankenstein. It was also used for some of Andy Milligan‚Äôs London-based movies such as The Body Beneath and The Rats Are Coming! The Werewolves Are Here!. It also appeared briefly in Disney's live-action movies 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians as the exterior of Cruella De Vil‚Äôs home.

Complete Peerage,Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, vol.IV, p.325 follows Beltz, who correctly states that the founding member was the 10th Earl's eldest son and heir apparent, Sir Hugh Courtenay (died 1349), the subject of this article, citing the latter's service in France in 1346, his presence at the siege of Calais in 1347 in the company of his uncle, William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton (died 1360), and his prowess at a tournament at Eltham Palace later that year in which he received from the King, 'as his guerdon, a hood of white cloth, buttoned with large pearls, and embroidered with figures of men in dancing postures'. Beltz also notes more pertinently that William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton (c. 1310 ‚Äì 1360) succeeded to Sir Hugh Courtenay's stall at Windsor, and since Northampton died in 1360, while Hugh Courtenay, 10th Earl of Devon, lived until 1377, Northampton could not have been successor to the 10th Earl of Devon in the Order of the Garter, and must therefore have been successor to Sir Hugh Courtenay, the 10th Earl of Devon's son, who died in 1348.. Marriage and children Before 3 September 1341, Courtenay married a certain \\"Elizabeth\\", said to have been Elizabeth de Bryan, daughter of Sir Guy de Bryan of Tor Bryan, Devon, (possibly through confusion with his son's wife)Cokayne, The Complete Peerage, new edition, vol.IV, p.325, note (c) \\" or possibly Elizabeth de Vere (died 1375), daughter of John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford by his wife Maud de Badlesmere. Elizabeth survived her first husband and married secondly, before 4 May 1351, John de Mowbray, 3rd Baron Mowbray (d. 4 October 1361), which marriage was later validated by papal dispensation of that date.. She married thirdly, before 18 January 1369, to Sir William de Cossington.. Elizabeth diedCokayne dates her death to 23 September 1375. 16 August 1375.. Courtenay had children by Elizabeth including: *Hugh Courtenay, 3rd Baron Courtenay, who married firstly, Margaret de Bryan, daughter of Guy de Bryan, and secondly, Maud de Holland, daughter of Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, and his wife, Joan, the daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, but died without issue on 20 February 1374.; . Death and burial Sir Hugh Courtenay died shortly after Easter term 1348,. aged 21, and was buried at Forde Abbey, Dorset.; . While on progress through Dorset, Queen Philippa is said to have placed a piece of cloth of gold as an oblation on his tomb on 2 September 1349.;. The cause of his death is unknown. But it is perhaps no coincidence that Courtenay's last resting place is only 55 kilometres north-west of Melcombe, the port where the Black Death first entered England in 1348. Had he died in battle or during a tournament, it is likely that his passing would have been recorded since he was the first of the original Garter knights to perish.

His term of office was marked by bitter political faction-fighting and he faced repeated calls for his removal. His descendants held the titles Earl of Mulgrave and Marquess of Normanby. Sir William Phips, the Governor of Massachusetts 1692-94, was his first cousin.Dunlop, DNBO'Flanagan, pp. 536-537 (indicating William was Constantine's father)  Early life  He was born in Reading, the third son of Francis Phipps and Anne Sharpe. Though they described themselves as \\"gentry\\", his family do not seem to have had much money: Constantine received a free education at Reading School. His uncle James emigrated to Maine where his numerous children, of whom the best known is his son William, the future Governor of Massachusetts, were born. Constantine won a scholarship to St. John's College, Oxford in 1672. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1678 and called to the Bar in 1684. He was a lawyer of great ability: in politics he was a strong Tory and suspected Jacobite,Ball, p. 35 which harmed his career. His name became associated with politically sensitive trials: he was junior counsel for the defence in the prosecution of Sir John Fenwick for his part in the conspiracy against William III in 1696. It was his management of the defence of Henry Sacheverell, impeached for preaching an inflammatory sermon in 1710, that made his name as a barrister and caused Queen Anne to favour him.  Lord Chancellor of Ireland  In 1710 Richard Freeman, the popular and respected Lord Chancellor of Ireland, died of a brain disease, and Phipps was chosen to succeed him. He arrived in Ireland in December and immediately became embroiled in political controversy. He was also appointed Lord Justice of Ireland, together with Richard Ingoldsby, and was a key member of the Dublin administration. As a convinced Tory, he sought to \\"pack\\" local councils with politically reliable sheriffs and justices of the peace. In Dublin itself the results were disastrous: a Whig Lord Mayor of Dublin, Sir John Eccles, was elected but the Government refused to recognise his election, and for two years the capital had no effective Government.Ball, p. 40. Other lesser incidents added to Phipps' unpopularity: although his good intentions need not be doubted, he showed very poor political judgment on several occasions, especially in the Dudley Moore case. For several years it had been the custom to celebrate King William III's landing at Torbay on 5 November 1688 with a performance of the play Tamerlane by Nicholas Rowe on the anniversary of the landing. In 1712 however the Government ordered that the prologue, which was considered to be politically inflammatory, be omitted. When a young gentleman called Dudley Moore went on stage to read it a scuffle broke out and he was charged with riot. This struck many people as an over-reaction: the prosecution lagged and was seemingly about to be withdrawn when Phipps made a speech to Dublin Corporation on the disorder in the city, and specifically referred to the Moore case. It is unlikely that he intended to influence the result of the trial, but the speech was widely seen as an interference with the course of justice.Ball, p. 44. Moore's case was contrasted with that of Edward Lloyd, a bookseller who published the Memoirs of the Chevalier St. George, better known as the Old Pretender. He was prosecuted for publishing seditious matter, but Phipps intervened to end the proceedings by nolle prosequi. His motives were entirely humane - Lloyd was a relatively poor man and the publication was purely a commercial venture, without any political implications - but it was widely seen as further evidence of a Jacobite conspiracy. Phipps' well-meant efforts to ban the annual procession round the statue of William III in College Green (once more on the grounds that it was inflammatory) increased his unpopularity.O'Flanagan, p. 541. In 1713 it was rumoured, wrongly, that the new Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Duke of Shrewsbury, had made it a condition of taking up office that Phipps be dismissed, together with his main ally on the Bench, Richard Nutley.Ball p.49 In the 1713 general election Phipps undertook to secure a Tory majority: but in fact the new House of Commons was deeply hostile to him. He was also blamed for the Dublin election riot by Tory supporters. By the spring of 1714 he was described as \\"the pivot on which all debate turned\\":Ball, p. 50. yet any of his actions which were denounced by the Commons found support in the House of Lords. A petition from the Commons to the Queen demanding his removal was followed by a counter-petition from the Lords in his defence, which stressed his loyalty to the Queen and to the Established Church. The Queen's death at the beginning of August resolved the problem since her successor George I simply dismissed her Irish judges en bloc.  Last years Unlike some of his colleagues Phipps was left in peace after his dismissal and his last years were uneventful. He spoke at the trial of George Seton, 5th Earl of Winton for his alleged acts of treason during the Jacobite Rising of 1715, but was severely reprimanded by the presiding judge for speaking without permission. In 1723 he assisted in the defence of Francis Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, also on a charge of treason, but he died at Middle Temple on 9 October. He was buried at White Waltham in Berkshire.  Family  Phipps married Catherine Sawyer, daughter of George Sawyer, and granddaughter of Sir Robert Sawyer who was Attorney General to Charles II, counsel for the defence at the Trial of the Seven Bishops in the reign of James II and Speaker of the House of Commons. Phipps and Catherine had one son, William, and a daughter, Catherine, who married Colonel Henry Ingoldsby, MP for Limerick, son of Colonel Richard Ingoldsby. William married Lady Catherine Annesley, daughter of James Annesley, 3rd Earl of Anglesey; she was a granddaughter of James II through her mother, the former Lady Catherine Darnley. Their son was Constantine Phipps, 1st Baron Mulgrave; later generations added the titles Earl of Mulgrave and Marquess of Normanby. The 1st Marquess was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1835 to 1839, and unlike his ancestor was popular with the Irish public.  Character  Phipps is a difficult character to judge: he was divisive in his lifetime and had also divided historians. Duhigg Duhigg, p. 284 thought badly of him, and Elrington Ball, in the definitive study of the pre-1921 Irish judiciary, dealt harshly with Phipps as a foolish, vain, self- important man whose extreme political views paralysed political life and brought the administration of Dublin to a halt. On the other hand, O'Flanagan in his work on the Irish Lord Chancellors spoke highly of Phipps as a gifted and moderate man who made a genuine attempt to calm political and religious strife in Ireland. He was a fine lawyer, and a reforming Chancellor: O'Flanagan praises his efforts to make litigation cheaper and faster, and suggests this was one cause of his unpopularity within his own profession.O'Flanagan, p. 336 He showed poor judgement in politics, but there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of his beliefs, which were no more extreme than those of many of his contemporaries. He was certainly to blame in part for the paralysis in the Dublin city government, but it is hardly fair to suggest, as Ball seems to, that he was wholly responsible for it:Ball, p.50 indeed all his actions found supporters. If he made enemies he also had friends and it is notable that both Jonathan Swift and George Berkeley spoke well of him.  Notes  References *Ball, F Elrington (1926).

Earl Smith, University Press of New England, 2006, p52 an addition that doubled the size of the original building was opened in 1983. Miller Library houses the humanities and social science collections, study rooms that are open 24 hours, a computer lab, the College archives, and Special Collections. Miller also contains a computer cluster and study areas that are open around the clock, and is equipped with wireless Internet access. An open- stack system allows access to the collection with the online catalog and electronic indexes and Internet files are available on library workstations and computers campus-wide. The collection supports all curriculum areas and contains more than 600 currently received print journals, more than 47,000 electronic journals, and domestic and international daily newspapers. The Colby libraries are a repository for U.S. government and Maine state documents. Colby College's Miller Library became the center of a national controversy when more than half the collection was transferred to storage in fall 2014. Lack of faculty consultation was documented in \\"Talking Points\\" unearthed by student journalist Nick Merrill of The Colby Echo. Articles were written against the renovation in Slate, The New Criterion, The Chronicle of Higher Education, and Colby Faculty published an open letter against the new Miller Library, the Colby administration's dismissal of professor's concerns, and the burdens to teaching and research that resulted. An original story by Matt Hongoltz-Hetling in The mid-Maine Morning Sentinel and the Portland Press Herald was carried by Publisher's Weekly and the Associated Press, appearing throughout major newspapers in the United States. Miller became a national example of the \\"Endangered Library,\\" and critics were quick to see the parallel with the New York Public Library plan to send a large part of its collection to storage: a plan reversed in 2014 shortly after the Colby Library controversy. According to the blog \\"Annoyed Librarian\\" published in the Library Journal, \\"the only person supporting this is the library director. The faculty and students are all protesting\\". On July 15, 2014, two-time Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning historian and Colby alumnus Alan Taylor wrote a letter to new Colby President David Greene protesting the \\"substituting office space for texts\\" in the Colby Library and the exclusion of faculty input in the renovation process.  Special Collections  The Charter of Colby College, on display in Miller Library's Colbiana Collection.

PET measures emissions from radioactively labeled metabolically active chemicals that have been injected into the bloodstream. The emission data from brain PET are computer-processed to produce multi-dimensional images of the distribution of the chemicals throughout the brain. Process The positron emitting radioisotopes used are usually produced by a cyclotron, and chemicals are labeled with these radioactive atoms. The radioisotopes used in clinics are normally 18F (fluoride), 11C (carbon) and 15O (oxygen). The labeled compound, called a radiotracer or radioligand, is injected into the bloodstream and eventually makes its way to the brain through blood circulation. Detectors in the PET scanner detect the radioactivity as the compound charges in various regions of the brain. A computer uses the data gathered by the detectors to create multi-dimensional (normally 3-dimensional volumetric or 4-dimensional time-varying) images that show the distribution of the radiotracer in the brain following the time. Especially useful are a wide array of ligands used to map different aspects of neurotransmitter activity, with by far the most commonly used PET tracer being a labeled form of glucose, such as fluorodeoxyglucose (18F).  Advantages and disadvantages  The greatest benefit of PET scanning is that different compounds can show flow and oxygen, and glucose metabolism in the tissues of the working brain. These measurements reflect the amount of brain activity in the various regions of the brain and allow to learn more about how the brain works. PET scans were superior to all other metabolic imaging methods in terms of resolution and speed of completion (as little as 30 seconds), when they first became available. The improved resolution permitted better study to be made as to the area of the brain activated by a particular task. The biggest drawback of PET scanning is that because the radioactivity decays rapidly, it is limited to monitoring short tasks.> Uses Images obtained with PET (axial sections) that show the effects of chronic drug exposure on various proteins involved in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission and on brain function (as assessed by brain glucose metabolism). While some effects are common to many drugs of abuse,...others are more specific. These include the decrease...in brain monoamine oxidase B (...the enzyme involved in DA metabolism) in cigarette smokers. The rainbow scale was used to code the PET images; radiotracer concentration is displayed from higher to lower as red > yellow > green > blue. Before the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) became widespread, PET scanning was the preferred method of functional (as opposed to structural) brain imaging, and it still continues to make large contributions to neuroscience. PET scanning is also useful in PET-guided stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery for treatment of intracranial tumors, arteriovenous malformations and other surgically treatable conditions. PET scanning is also used for diagnosis of brain disease, most notably because brain tumors, strokes, and neurondegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) all cause great changes in brain metabolism, which in turn causes detectable changes in PET scans. PET is probably most useful in early cases of certain dementias (with classic examples being Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease) where the early damage is too diffuse and makes too little difference in brain volume and gross structure to change CT and standard MRI images enough to be able to reliably differentiate it from the \\"normal\\" range of cortical atrophy which occurs with aging (in many but not all) persons, and which does not cause clinical dementia. PET is also actively used for multiple sclerosis and other acquired demyelinating syndromes, but mainly for research into pathogenesis instead of diagnosis. They use specific radioligands for microglial activity. Currently is widely used the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Also combined PET-CT are sometimes performed.  Tracer Types  PET imaging with oxygen-15 indirectly measures blood flow to the brain. In this method, increased radioactivity signal indicates increased blood flow which is assumed to correlate with increased brain activity. Because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical cyclotron for such uses, which is difficult. PET imaging with 18F-FDG takes advantage of the fact that the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose. Standard 18F-FDG PET of the brain measures regional glucose use and can be used in neuropathological diagnosis. * Example: Brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease greatly decrease brain metabolism of both glucose and oxygen in tandem. Therefore 18F-FDG PET of the brain may also be used to successfully differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of 18F-FDG PET for these uses is its much wider availability. Some radioactive tracers used for Alzheimer's are florbetapir 18F, flutemetamol F18, PiBand florbetaben 18F, which are all used to detect amyloid-beta plaques (a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's) in the brain. * Examples: PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of seizure focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several radiotracers (i.e. radioligands) have been developed for PET that are ligands for specific neuroreceptor subtypes such as [11C] raclopride, [18F] fallypride and [18F] desmethoxyfallypride for dopamine D2/D3 receptors, [11C] McN 5652 and [11C] DASB for serotonin transporters, [18F] Mefway for serotonin 5HT1A receptors, [18F] Nifene for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-FDOPA for the AADC enzyme). These agents permit the visualization of neuroreceptor pools in the context of a plurality of neuropsychiatric and neurologic illnesses. The development of a number of novel probes for noninvasive, in vivo PET imaging of neuroaggregate in human brain has brought amyloid imaging to the doorstep of clinical use. The earliest amyloid imaging probes included 2-(1-{6-[(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile ([18F]FDDNP) developed at the University of California, Los Angeles and N-methyl-[11C]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (termed Pittsburgh compound B) developed at the University of Pittsburgh. These amyloid imaging probes permit the visualization of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and could assist clinicians in making a positive clinical diagnosis of AD pre-mortem and aid in the development of novel anti-amyloid therapies. [11C]PMP (N-[11C]methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate) is a novel radiopharmaceutical used in PET imaging to determine the activity of the acetylcholinergic neurotransmitter system by acting as a substrate for acetylcholinesterase. Post-mortem examination of AD patients have shown decreased levels of acetylcholinesterase. [11C]PMP is used to map the acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain, which could allow for pre- mortem diagnoses of AD and help to monitor AD treatments. Avid Radiopharmaceuticals has developed and commercialized a compound called florbetapir that uses the longer-lasting radionuclide fluorine-18 to detect amyloid plaques using PET scans.  Challenges  Main article: Clinical significance in Blood-brain barrier One main challenge for developing new PET tracers for neuroimaging is that these tracers must cross the blood-brain barrier. Commonly, small molecules which are fat soluble have been used as they can pass the blood-brain barrier through lipid mediated passive diffusion. However, as pharmaceutics move towards large biomolecules for therapies, new research has also focused on using biomolecules, such as antibodies, for PET tracers. These new larger PET tracers have increased difficulty passing the BBB as they are too large to passively diffuse across. Therefore, recent research is investigating methods to carry biomolecules across the BBB using endogenous transport systems including carrier-mediated transporters such as glucose and amino acid carriers, receptor-mediated transcytosis for insulin or transferrin.

History  Origins and rebranding  The company was originally incorporated in October 1997 as Aero Surveys Limited and later rebranded its activities as Air Shuttle. It operated two Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante aircraft for domestic charters and air taxi services, gaining its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC), in August 2009. In 2011, the ownership of the airline changed, which resulted in a further rebranding to a new commercial name, Starbow, with regional flights in mind. A communication and recruitment campaign was launched and two 94 seat BAe 146-300 jet aircraft were acquired for scheduled domestic passenger services. Starbow began domestic flights out of Kotoka International Airport on 26 September 2011, serving Kumasi and Tamale. The aircraft offered both business and economy class seating. Starbow added its 3rd destination on 8 November 2011, with return flights to Takoradi from its Accra base.  Expansion plans curtailed  On 3 February 2012, after just five months in operation, Starbow announced that they had finalised a deal to lease two additional BAe 146-300 aircraft that would double their fleet size to four aircraft. The aircraft entered into service less than 6 months later. Starbow's first international route was announced on 31 July 2012. The up to 5 times weekly service from Accra to Cotonou in Benin started 13 August 2012. Abidjan in the Ivory Coast became the carrier's second international destination. The route launched on 8 November 2012 with flights operating up to 5 times weekly from Accra.

Life Eric was born in 1272 as the second son of Eric I, Duke of Schleswig, by his wife Margaret of Rugia. He held the island of Langeland in fief and inherited the properties of the ducal family in southern Funen, just as his uncle, Abel, Lord of Langeland, had before him. He is mentioned for the first time as responsible for the killing of the seneschal Skjalm Stigsen on 23 August 1292. The murder was probably a result of the enmity caused when King Eric VI of Denmark, after coming of age, confiscated the fief of Langeland and the properties of the ducal family in southern Funen. Together with his brother, Duke Valdemar, he joined the king's enemies. In 1293, there was a clash between the two parties at Sommersted Heath near Haderslev which resulted in a compromise where Eric received Langeland as a fief. Subsequently, he married Sophia of Querfurt, a daughter of Jutta of Saxony, widow of King Eric IV of Denmark in her second marriage to Burchard VIII, Count of Querfurt-Rosenburg. Sophia was thus a half-sister of King Eric IV's daughters, among which were the deceased Queen Ingeborg of Norway, mother of King Eric II of Norway. The marriage thus connected Eric to the king of Norway, who knighted him, and also led to a new conflict with King Eric VI, who retained his wife's inheritance from her half-sisters. On 3 February 1296 a compromise was entered in Vordingborg, in which the king promised to hand over Sophia's inheritance, but where the ducal family's properties in southern Funen, which had formerly belonged to Abel, Lord of Langeland, were kept by the king as lawfully acquired from Abel's daughter. Only the city of Rudk√∏bing was transferred to become part of the fief of Langeland, and Eric confirmed the city's rights on the same day. Eric died in 1310. In 1315, Sophia, in the presence of the king and several noblemen, donated the inheritance of her sisters to Saint Agnes' Priory in Roskilde, keeping only the city of Sk√¶lsk√∏r for herself. Marriage and issue Eric married Sophia of Querfurt, a daughter of Burchard VIII, Count of Querfurt- Rosenburg, Burgrave of Magdeburg and Jutta of Saxony, widow of Eric IV of Denmark. The marriage was childless. Ancestry References *Biography in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon 1. ed.

Their debut studio album, Stories from the Border, was released in 2011. Their follow up album Lost at Sea was released in 2014. Tracks from both albums have been played on BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Merseyside, XFM and Amazing Radio, amongst others. Their music featured on BBC 2's \\"Our Coast\\" in February, 2020. They list Doves, Elbow, Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Pink Floyd, Boards of Canada, The Flaming Lips, The Beatles, The Bluetones, The Stone Roses, Aphex Twin, Spiritualized, Father John Misty, John Grant amongst their influences. High profile fans include Jeremy Vine, Adrian Chiles, and TV Chef, Bryn Williams. Their third album \\"Crossfire\\" was released on 3rd April, 2020 and has already received plays on BBC Radio Wales. History An early version of the band was formed in 2000 when school mates Marcel Delrue and Jamie Russell were introduced by a mutual friend to Stuart Bennett and Clare Stevenson who worked together at a local HMV store. They began playing together putting music to poems that Clare had written. In time brothers Matty Goddard and Chris Goddard parted ways with a previous band and joined The Reads. Throughout these early years the band played at local and city venues all over the North West and North Wales. In March 2010, the band was approached by a friend who offered to fund the cost of recording their first studio album. Music Producer Jim Spencer, known for his work with Oasis, Doves and The Charlatans was enlisted to record and mix the album. The project was later joined by Joe Duddell who took time out from working with Mercury Prize winning band Elbow to come up with string and brass arrangements for five of the 12 songs. The album was mastered by Frank Arkwright who has worked with bands such as Arcade Fire, The Smiths and Gomez. The album was played live for the first time at Telford's Warehouse a music venue in Chester to a sell out crowd. Positive local reviews of the album attracted attention of BBC Radio Wales, leading to the song \\"Orange Days\\" being Single of the Week from 16 May 2011 and the band playing a Live In Session at the BBC studios in Cardiff on 27 June 2011. Their first single, \\"Good Omens\\" is also set to be Single of the Week from 1 August 2011. Further BBC radio airplay was gained through Jeremy Vine on The Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2. They released their second album Lost at Sea in 2014 which featured singles played by BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Merseyside. Once again, it was produced and mixed by Jim Spencer and mastered by Frank Arkwright at Abbey Road Studios. There followed a period of inactivity with only a handful of gigs, before the band began work on a new album in spring 2018. This was recorded at Hope Mill Recording Studios, Manchester and EVE Studio, Stockport and was mixed and produced by Jim Spencer. Again, it was mastered by Frank Arkwright at Abbey Road Studios.

Both glaciers are accessed by gondola and chair lifts and is one of only two ski resorts in the world offering skiing 365 days a year (the other being Zermatt in Switzerland). At its highest point the ski region reaches a height of in the saddle between the peaks of the Gefrorene-Wand-Spitzen. Hintertux glacier is one of the most popular glaciers in Austria. It is open all year round with skiing in the winter, and hiking activities in the summer.  Ice  View towards Hintertux, with view of the L√§rmstange ski route The ice of the Hintertux Glacier is up to thick at its deepest point. It has a length of about , but this varies annually by up to . As a result, the lifts have to be moved several times a year so that the masts remain vertical. The glacier contains up to about 190 million cubic metres of ice.Information about the ice of the glacier  Tourism  The Hintertux Glacier offers skiing all year round. Its height means that there are usually good snow conditions, enabling almost all pistes and lifts to be kept open. The glacier skiing region has its own ski school for both beginners and advanced skiers. In addition to the winter sports facilities the Hintertux Glacier offers an all-round view of the Alps from just under 3,250 m. The region is also suitable for mountaineering ‚Äì there are plenty of Alpine huts, some managed all-year round. One of these huts is the Spannagelhaus next to the natural monument of the Spannagel Cave, which is over 10 km long and the largest cave system in the Austrian Central Alps. The cave entrance is immediately next to the Spannagelhaus. A crevasse ‚Äì the Natural Ice Palace (Natur Eis Palast) ‚Äì can also be viewed. Its entrance is just above the top station on the Gletscherbus 3 lift. Visitors can climb about 25 metres down into the ice using a combination of steps and ladders.Brochure for the crevasse, accessed on 5 January 2011  Lift and cable cars  To transport the large number of tourists on the Hintertux Glacier, three large gondola lifts of the Funitel type have been built: the so-called glacier buses (Gletscherbusse) where the gondolas are suspended on two steel cables and are able to carry 24 people each. The third large gondola lift was opened in the 2008/2009 winter season. It is now called the Gletscherbus 1 and runs from the valley station up to the Sommerbergalm. It replaced the older 4-man gondolas that had previously handled the transport of people to the Sommerbergalm along with the 8-man gondola lift that is still running. In order to ensure all-year operations there are 2 cableways in each section of the feeders from the valley station to the Gefrorene Wand. Overall, there are 18 lifts to transport winter sports tourist and other visitors from the Hintertux valley station (Talstation Hintertux, 1500 m) up to the glacier.

Biography 1856-62 John Gorrie was born in the parish of Kingskettle, Fife, Scotland, a son of the Rev. Daniel Gorrie, United Presbyterian Minister, and Jane Moffat. He was educated at the village school, subsequently at Madras College, St Andrews, and then at the University of Edinburgh. He was called to the Scottish Bar in 1856. Sir John's advocacy that the volunteer movement should be made a national one, by including all ranks of the people, that force owed a great deal at its start. At the request of the Lord Provost of Edinburgh he himself raised a couple of artisan companies of 100 men each in a single day, and this continued until a whole battalion was formed out of similar materials. The example of Edinburgh was quickly followed throughout the country, and the impulse then given has never been lost. In 1862 he became a leader-writer on the Morning Star, having as colleagues many men who subsequently distinguished themselves in literature and politics. 1865-68 In 1865, on the news reaching the UK of the disturbances in Jamaica, which led ultimately to the removal and attempted trial of Governor Edward Eyre, Gorrie was invited by the Jamaica Committee to go out to represent them before the Royal Commission in the colony. This service, which extended over several months, having been performed to the entire satisfaction of his constituents, Gorrie returned to his usual vocations in London until 1868, when he offered his services to the Border Burghs. Finding, however, that his candidature would split up the advanced Liberal party, a portion of whom considered themselves pledged to Sir George (then Mr. Trevelyan), he withdrew. 1869 In 1869, Gorrie was offered and accepted the post of Substitute Procureur-General in Mauritius, and a few months after his arrival became a Puisne judge. He was a member of a Commission that discovered an extraordinary system of legal oppression upon natives of India who had completed their indentures as coolies, and he also showed how properties were wasted by legal costs, because of the officials misunderstanding the spirit and meaning of the local ordinances. Gorrie boldly protected the Creoles and coolies alike from all attempted oppression. 1876 In 1876, he was appointed Chief Justice of Fiji. In the new colony of Fiji, an altogether different native race and language had to be studied, and as the Chief Justice was a member of the Legislative Council, a different class of work had to be undertaken. Perhaps the most useful work done by Gorrie at that time was the application of the Torrens system of land titles to the land which had been acquired by Europeans in the new colony. Whilst engaged in these labours, the High Commission for the Western Pacific was organized by an Order in Council (1877), the Chief Justice becoming Chief Justice of Fiji and Chief Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific. He also acted for upwards of one year as High Commissioner. 1882‚Äì1886 After being knighted in 1882, Sir John was appointed to the old West India Colonies, now united into the Leeward Islands, as Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands. While there, he contributed most materially to overthrow the custom of consignee's lien, which favoured the London merchant at the expense of local creditors; and also the Encumbered Estates Court, which made West Indian properties change hands in London without giving people in the locality a chance to bid. Sir John drafted with great labour an ordinance to introduce Indefeasible Titles, and to give security for local advances. This ordinance ultimately became law, and Sir John received a unanimous vote of thanks from the Leeward Islands Legislature. Appointed Chief Justice of Trinidad in 1885 he was asked to remain in the Leeward Islands until 1886. 1886‚Äì1892 In 1885 Sir John was transferred to Trinidad as Chief Justice of Trinidad, moving in 1886. In both that island and in Tobago, annexed to Trinidad in 1889, he energetically endeavoured to make the Courts of Justice accessible to all, to administer justice impartially, and to promote measures for the well being of the colony. An Australian newspaper wrote, but this welcome was not universal. Because of his attempts to help the underdog, encouraging sharecroppers, peasants, and labourers in Tobago to assert their rights and attempting to ease the financial burdens on Trinidad's black population, the √©lites of both Trinidad and Tobago saw Gorrie as a threat to their interests. As a result of a campaign to remove him, a commission investigated his administration of justice in Trinidad and Tobago, and when the governor suspended him from office pending a final decision in London, he returned to Britain in the middle of 1892 to fight his case personally but died a few days after arrival on 4 August 1892. Family He married, on 6 December 1855, Marion, daughter of Michael Graham of Edinburgh, who died in 1884, leaving issue. His daughter Isabella Jane Gorrie (born 1865) married Hamilton Hunter (born 1846), (Consul of Tonga 1901), Deputy Commissioner for Western Pacific 1881, who tried a murder case on Pitcairn Island. His son Malcolm Graham (born 1864) followed his father into law, becoming a barrister and working as Sir John's secretary until Sir John's death.

In 1994, following decades of neglect, Plymouth's General Federation of Women's Clubs, led by Janice Williams, undertook the task of reclaiming the once beautiful cemetery from decades of overgrowth. A new shed was constructed to house the equipment needed to maintain the grounds. Iron fences were painted, headstones repaired, trees removed, road repairs begun and new street signs installed. In 2008, the Shawnee Cemetery Preservation Association took over the work of maintaining the grounds. Led by president Tom Jesso Sr., the group has installed benches, made roadway repairs, removed brush, and repaired headstones. The Association's efforts to reclaim several hundred graves from the overgrowth in the outermost sections have facilitated the compilation of historical data, and revealed the borders of the cemetery.

Currently about 10 kilometres of cave have been discovered; guided tours enable access to 500 metres of the cave. Its entrance lies below the Spannagelhaus (2531 m), a mountain hut formerly run by the Austrian Tourist Club (√ñTK). The cave and the hut are named after Dr. Rudolf Spannagel, who was the president of the √ñTK from 1902 to 1904.  Formation  The overwhelming part of the Zillertal Alps consists of the crystalline primary rocks, plutons and metamorphic rock, that do not support the formation of caves. The only exceptions are pockets of rock capable of karstification such as limestone, dolomite, gypsum and other carbonates. These pockets are generally of quite low thickness, and only allow small caves to be formed. The creation of caves also requires water solubility. The Spannagel Cave has arisen in a large vein of Jurassic calcite marble of the Hochstegen Formation,Spannagel Cave, Austria at www.bookrags.com. Accessed on 20 Jul 2011. a marble with over 90% total carbonate content, that runs through the slate mantle of the Western Tauern window. The formation of this extensive cave as a result of geological corrosion (and mixing corrosion) is explained by the tectonics of the region.  Features  The cave is characterised by the strong presence of damps and heavy moisture penetration (even leading to cascades). The various stream passages (M√ºndungsl√∂cher) form siphons in places that are only accessible by diving. In those cave passages far from daylight there are rare helictites. The Spannagel Cave System extends from the Gefrorne-Wand-Kees glacier to the L√§rmstange, 2,686 m, and is the highest large cave in Europe Jacoby, E. (1977) with a measured length to date of 10 kilometres. During guided tours the cave's many features (coloured marble, various calc-sinter formations, speleothems, crystals, banded marbles and kolks) are explained. In addition, the age of the cave and its formation are described, as are its flora and fauna, climate and cave atmosphere which is beneficial for those suffering from lung ailments. Bats only appear in the vicinity of the cave exits - albeit some get lost in the entrance area. A cave museum has been established in the eastern section of this passageway where several discoveries from the interior of the mountain are displayed.  Discovery  In 1919 Alois Hotter, the proprietor of the Spannagelhaus, discovered the cave entrance. He called the cave the Grausliches Loch and used it, as did several other tenants after him, as a rubbish pit. In 1960 Rudolf Radislovich first explored the front part of the cave with its main entrance (Hauptgang) and \\"water entrance\\" (Wassergang), both of which meet in the Hall of Union (Halle der Vereinigung). In the following year, Max H. Fink surveyed the known section of the cave and discovered the Labyrinth. In 1964 the Federal Monuments Office (Bundesdenkmalamt) designated the cave as a natural monument because of its scientific importance. In 1968 Walter Knezicek and G√ºnther J. Wolf discovered two shafts and the Knesi-Harnisch at the right hand edge of the Halle der Vereinigung, which all led down into a tunnel about 10 metres below. This was the start of what later became known as the Schrauben- Ca√±on (\\"Screw Canyon\\"). In 1970 Hannes Jodl found the Postkastl (\\"Postbox\\") at the left hand end of the Halle der Vereinigung, which turned out to be a continuation of the Spannagel Cave. The first person to enter this section was G√ºnther J. Wolf with seven members of his ice course. The research of the Kolkgang passage (ascending to the Elchsch√§delgang passage and Dirndlkammer chamber, a link with the Wassergang, and descending via the Kolkgang to the Hannes-Jodl-Dom, at whose ceiling the Schrauben-Ca√±on enters, onwards to the Dr.-Klaus-Karger-Halle and continuing as the Kolkgang to the edge of the √ñTK- Schacht shaft) resulted in a doubling of the hitherto known extent of the cave and offered an incentive for further exploration. The Schrauben-Ca√±on canyon. The years 1972 to 1975 saw four survey expeditions by the State Caving Club in Tyrol (Landesverein f√ºr H√∂hlenkunde in Tirol), that advanced as far as the Gneisbach stream. In 1975, as part of a research week by the Groupe Sp√©l√©ologique Luxembourgeois with E. Jacoby, M. M√∂ller, G. Mutschlechner and B. Schmitz, the course of the H√∂hlenbach stream was established. By dying the water it was demonstrated that it surfaced at about 1,980 m in the middle of a rock face south of Waldeben. Likewise the Schneefleck Cave (Schneefleckh√∂hle), which runs parallel to the Spannagel Cave, was discovered and surveyed. In 1976 the Caving Club erected a bivouac in the Umkehrhalle hall. A 50-hour expedition led by E. Jacoby in 1976/77 discovered and researched the Spinnengang passage, the Mutschlechner-Dom cavern and the Schatzkammer chamber. In 1978 F. Maiberger and W. Mayr reached the westernmost point of the cave, the Bauchbad. In 1984 German speleologists in the Tyrolean Caving Club under the direction of C. Cavelius surveyed the South System (S√ºdsystem). In 1987 and 1988 the entrance area of the cave was cleared out, and the gallery joining the Tr√ºmmerhalle and Gneisbach were discovered and surveyed by W. Mayr and G. V√∂lkl.

The species is known from Early Oligocene, Rupelian stage, lake deposits near the commune of C√©reste in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. History and classification Neurosymploca? oligocenica is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen \\"MNHN-LP-R 55185\\". It is a single, mostly complete adult which may be male, preserved as a compression fossil in fine grained shale. The shale specimen is from the fossil bearing calcareous and oilshale outcrops of paleolake C√©reste. The type specimen is currently preserved in the paleoentomological collections housed in the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, the National Museum of Natural History, located in Paris, France. N.? oligocenica was first studied by Fidel Fern√°ndez-Rubio of Madrid, Spain and Andr√© Nel of the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, with their 2000 type description being published in the journal Bolet√≠n de La S.E.A. Fern√°ndez-Rubio and Nel coined the specific epithet oligocenica as a reference to Oligocene, the age of the species. At the time of description, a second fossil possibly from the same species had recently been discovered, however as it was being held in a private collection in Strasbourg, France, it was unavailable for study. Description The holotype of N.? oligocenica is long with a robust thorax and an abdomen which has four possible color bands and a definite darker fifth band near the apex. The slender antennae are 38‚Äì46 segments long, with tips which form less differentiated antennal clubs at the tips than modern species in the family. The antennae display a rhomboidal cross section that is not present in any other member of the family. While poorly preserved and partly disarticulated, the legs are very similar in appearance to modern species. The fore wings are long and wide, giving a length to width ratio that is greater than in modern species, and fits the suggestion put forth by B. Alberti in 1954 that modern species of Neurosymploca have narrower wings than other members of the tribe. The hind wings are mostly obscured by the fore wings. While partial, the fore and hind wings still show some color pattering. The counterpart side of the fossil displays three distinct light spots in the uniformly clear brown fore wings and the hind wings show the characteristic rectangular spot found in some modern species. N.? oligocenica has the same combination of characters as modern Neurosymploca species, which indicates a probable diurnal lifestyle. N.? oligocenica is also the oldest member of the subfamily Zygaeninae and its presence in the Oligocene of France confirms the ancestors of the modern Palearctic genera Epizygaenella and Zyngaena were present in Europe before the Miocene. The rhomboid antenna structuring found in N.? oligocenica is unique, and leaves the phylogenetic position of the species uncertain, with the possibility it may represent an extinct genus rather than being a member of Neurosymploca.

As an artist, Blanton-Taylor was an illustrator, painter, printmaker, and sculptor. She is best known for her works often described as \\"spiritual abstractions\\". Blayton was a founding member of the Studio Museum in Harlem and board secretary., co-founder and executive director of Harlem Children's Art Carnival (CAC), and a co-founder of Harlem Textile Works. She was also an advisor, consultant and board member to a variety of other arts and community-based service organizations and programs. Her abstract methods created a space for the viewer to insert themselves into the piece, allowing for self reflection, a central aspect of Blayton-Taylor‚Äôs work. Early life and education Betty Blayton-Taylor was born in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1937. Her parents were Alleyne Houser Blayton and Dr. James Blaine ‚ÄúJimmy‚Äù Blayton, and she was the second oldest of their four children. Her parents were also active in the African American community. Her father opened the first hospital for black people in his district and her mother constantly fought for education for all. Blayton studied at Bruton Heights until 8th grade and then continued her education at Palmer Memorial Institute in North Carolina until 1955. Blayton received Bachelor of Fine Arts from Syracuse University and continued her education at the Art Students League and the Brooklyn Museum School. In 1955 when Betty set off for college, Virginia did not allow African Americans to attend any of its segregated all-white universities due to its Jim Crow laws and no public black college in the state offered an accredited degree her chosen major, so Virginia had to pay her full tuition throughout the four years of her college career in order to comply with the federally mandated \\"separate but equal\\" requirements for education. This allowed her to attend the school of her choice tuition-free. She graduated in 1959 with a BFA degree in painting and illustration with honors. She then taught at St. Thomas in 1960 for a short period of time before moving to New York. Career and contribution Blayton made a major impact on the art museum and foundation world of New York City, working as a museum art educator and co-founding a number of organizations. From 1968 to 1994, she was a consultant to the City of New York Board of Education where she helped develop arts education in public schools and programs. She served as supervisor for the Museum of Modern Art's outreach program to inner city youth. As a co-founder, with Victor D'Amico, and later as executive director, she developed and lead the Children's Art Carnival at the Harlem School of Arts. One of her most successful students was Jean-Michel Basquiat, who is thought to have learned his appreciation of adolescent creativity from Blayton-Taylor‚Äôs philosophy that spirit is more important than technique when it comes to your artwork. The program, developed by MoMA in the 1960s for city children, struggled after the loss of government funding in the 1980s, but Blayton worked to find commercial funding to keep it alive. After she moved to New York, she became a part of the Association Community Team of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited where she taught teenagers about art and encouraged them to visit MoMA. When she found her students were denied entry to the museum, she used her contacts there to make sure that did not happen again. This combined with Blayton-Taylor‚Äôs idea to create a museum in her student‚Äôs own community is what led to the creation of the Studio Museum where she served as secretary and executive associate from 1965-1977. She was also a cofounder and board member of Harlem Textile Works. Blayton was a founding member of the Studio Museum in Harlem and served on its board from 1965 to 1977. She also served on the board of the Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop.

Pope. The founding aim of the society was to promote the study of Anglo-Norman language and Anglo-Norman literature by facilitating the publication of reliable scholarly editions of a broad range of texts of literary, linguistic, historical and legal value and interest. Based in the United Kingdom, the Society draws individual and institutional members from across the world. Publications Annual Texts series The original series of publications launched by the Society was the Anglo-Norman Texts series, sometimes referred to as the Annual Texts series. The aim of this series was to produce an edition each year (or one volume of a multi-volume edition each year), yet while this rhythm has generally been maintained throughout the Society's history, unforeseen circumstances have on occasion led to minor delays or gaps in this schedule. The series has featured editions by some of the most renowned Anglo-Norman specialists of their time, including Mildred Pope, M. Dominica Legge, Alexander Bell, Ronald C. Johnson, Anthony J. Holden, Brian Merrilees, Ian Short, Tony Hunt, and Delbert Russell. Plain Texts series The Annual Texts series was complemented by the launch of two additional series in 1983. The first of these was the Plain Texts series, which has the goal of providing a critical text predominantly for shorter works, but without the more detailed introduction and notes provided in the Annual Texts series. Occasional Publications series The second series was the Occasional Publications series, which, as the name suggests, has been reserved for publications which fall outside the remit of the other series. The first release in this series was a volume of essays compiled in memory of the Society's long-serving President, T. B. W. Reid.

The line also included the Round Top Branch over the Gettysburg Battlefield to Round Top, Pennsylvania until . History The Gettysburg and Harrisburg Railway was formed when the \\"Reading Railroad\\" took control of the South Mountain Railroad and on May 22, 1891, the Gettysburg and Harrisburg Railroad (the G & H RR superintendent, W. H. Woodward, was retained). (larger article in The Philadelphia Record) On May 18, 1897, on the north side of the railroad‚Äôs station at Gettysburg, the \\"Reading Railway\\" had finished another siding across Washington St. By 1904, the Gettysburg yards had 5 sidings, including 3 over Washington St and 1 toward Pennsylvania College's 1889 Glatfelter Hall. Attached to the Washington St siding south of the station was the sole westward siding to the turntable and the roundhouse, which was on the northeast corner of the crossing. The crossing was the site of a 1909 Reading and Western Maryland collision of freight trains. Just prior to the 1913 Gettysburg reunion, additional passing sidings on the \\"Gettysburg & Harrisburg branch of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway company\\" were constructed between Goodyear and Gettysburg, and a switch from Round Top Branch connected westbound onto the Western Maryland. The state health department operated reunion comfort stations at both Gettysburg depots (cf. Gettysburg Railroad Station), and President Woodrow Wilson used the Round Top Branch to depart the Great Camp on his special train. Similarly, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's southbound train passed the Eternal Light Peace Memorial and stopped at a special station from where he motored to Oak Hill to dedicate the memorial during the 1938 Gettysburg reunion. In 1924, the land for the Idaville station was sold. One of the railroad‚Äôs last excursion trains was a May 7, 1939, Reading Railroad train with 400 from Philadelphia over the Round Top Branch. Except for special occasions, e.g., Bethlehem students in 1958, Reading passenger service to Gettysburg ceased in 1941; and a 1942 application was made to abandon nearly the entire Round Top Branch. The station was repainted in 1946, and the turntable and 3-engine roundhouse had been removed before 1970. The Gettysburg spur south of the east-west Western Maryland RR crossing and that had been part of the Round Top Branch remained until at least 1962. Subsequent companies The Reading Company filed for bankruptcy in 1971 and the railway line was owned by Conrail in 1976 from April 1-October. The line was purchased by the Blairsville & Indiana Railroad which changed its name to Gettysburg Railroad (1976‚Äì1996) and used the line for freight and, under its Gettysburg Passenger Services subsidiary, tourist excursions. (In the mid 1990s the line's junction at Gettysburg was moved west to Seminary Ridge.) In 1996 the line was purchased by the RailAmerica subsidiary, Delaware Valley Railroad Company, which created a new operating company,U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \\"Report Form 10-K: RailAmerica, Inc.,\\" for the year ending 1996. Gettysburg Railway, that included Gettysburg Scenic Rail Tours. The line was sold October 1997 to John H. Marino,STB Finance Docket No. 33505, November 21, 1997 who operated the line until 2001. The station was purchased by Gettysburg College (which requested restoration funds in 1999) and was used by the Pioneer Lines Scenic Railway for diesel excursions on the line by 2007. The remaining G. & H. tracks are part of the Gettysburg & Northern Railroad which transports ‚Äùcanned goods, pulpboard, soda ash, grain, and scrap paper‚Äù and connects via 6 stations to the Norfolk Southern Railway at Mount Holly Springs and CSX Transportation at Gettysburg.

Although he is only a minor character (appearing in just 1/10 of the book at the end of chapter three), he is the most famous because he inspired so many Russian revolutionaries. His only action in the story is to give the heroine, Vera Pavlovna, a note from her husband explaining that he has faked his suicide. He also offers his criticisms to Vera Pavlovna for her abandoning of her sewing cooperative. Rakhmetov is descended from Rakhmet, a thirteenth-century Tatar chief. He is the second youngest of eight children. He inherits 400 serfs and 7,000 acres of land. He is 22 when the novel takes place. His father is deeply conservative and clever. At 15, he falls in love with his father's mistress. He studies at St. Petersburg University from 16‚Äì19, then gives up his studies to travel, estranging himself from his siblings and in-laws. At 17 he builds up his physical strength through gymnastics, then by barge hauling at 20 from which he gets the nickname Nikitouchka Lomoff, a legendarily strong boat hauler on the Volga. His other nickname is 'the rigorist'. He performs all kinds of manual labor on his travels: digging, sawing and iron forging. He explains: \\"I must do it, it will make me loved and esteemed by the common people. And it is useful ; some day it may prove good for some-thing.\\"What Is to Be Done? page 211 He befriends five or six students and studies obsessively, reading continuously for 82 hours, fueled by eight strong coffees before sleeping for 15 hours. He adopts a strict, puritanical way of life. He is celibate, teetotal, sleeps on planks and usually eats black bread and steak. The only luxury he allows himself are fine cigars \\"Without my cigar I cannot think; if that is a fact, it is not my fault; but perhaps it is due to the weakness of my will.\\"What Is to Be Done? page 213 In St. Petersburg, he permits himself oranges because there ordinary people eat them, but in the countryside he doesn't touch them. After six months continuous reading (mainly Nikolai Gogol, Adam Smith, David Ricardo and John Stuart Mill), he decides he has acquired enough knowledge. He never visits people longer than necessary and only visits people with influence over others. He only visits his home to sleep at two or three in the morning. His ultimate act of self punishment is sleeping on a bed of nails, which may have been based on certain Orthodox Saints. He explains this as a \\"A trial. It was necessary to make it. Improbable, certainly, but at all events it was necessary to make it. I know now what I can do.\\"What Is to Be Done? page 219 Two months later he loses a lump of flesh saving a 19-year- old widow from a stampeding horse. She nurses him, falls in love with him but he rejects her explaining his devotion to the people precludes love. He tours Europe and the USA. He is rumoured to have met the founder of a new German school of philosophy, possibly Karl Marx. He has decidedly modern views on suicide, only understanding it if it is to escape a painful illness.  Impact  Rakhmetov was variously regarded as a saint, holy fool or just an eccentric. He inspired the founders of Russian Nihilism and Bolshevism. Vladimir Lenin imitated Rakhmetov with daily weight lifting,Orlando Figes, The People's Tragedy ,page 389 while Sergei Nechayev copied him by sleeping on a wooden bed and living on black bread. Nikolai Ishutin copied the character's boat hauling feats.Andrew Michael Drozd, Chernyshevskii's What is to be done?: a reevaluation, page 115 Anarchist Alexander Berkman used Rakhmetov as a pseudonym when he prepared to assassinate Henry Clay Frick in 1892. His character was praised by the Soviet government as an example of how the new Soviet man should act. The main character of Andr√© Gide's Les caves du Vatican (English: Lafcadio's Adventures), Lafcadio, bears a striking resemblance to Rakhmetov.

He also wrote the music for \\"So Until I See You\\", the closing theme for The Tonight Show with Jack Paar in the early 1960s, and was the pianist for A Tribute to Eddie Duchin, which was a soundtrack for the 1956 biographical film pic The Eddy Duchin Story. Biography Lerner was born on April 7, 1919, in Cleveland, the youngest of three children. Their father Abraham had died on November 11, 1918, before Al's birth, a victim of the 1918 flu pandemic. Lerner's mother Jennie Takiff then married a sheet metal worker named Abe Lerner, who became Al's adopted father. During the American Prohibition banning the sale of alcohol, Abe Lerner used his metalworking abilities on the side to make stills for Cleveland gangsters and bootleggers, and used his seven-year-old son Al as a courier for payments. It was a rough neighborhood with regular mob wars between rival gangsters, multiple killings on Lerner's street, and payoffs to the local police. Abe Lerner was eventually arrested and the still business was shut down, after which the family went broke. As a child, Lerner helped to bring in money by climbing onto tables in local saloons and singing songs such as \\"All Alone by the Telephone\\", and then collecting coins thrown by the patrons. He then took piano lessons at a convent next to St. Anne's Hospital, but quit because he thought it was too difficult. When he saw a performance by Bill Robinson at The Palace, he decided he wanted to learn tap dancing, so studied with Roy Lewis, and soon was winning amateur contests. He was also learning how to play drums from his brother Harold, and began playing for $1.50/night at a local brothel. As he tired of carrying the drums back and forth though, he decided to switch back to piano as it was easier, and resumed his lessons. His skills continued to improve, and by the age of 17 he had worked his way up to earning $15/week, playing at clubs such as Shadowland, and developing an affinity for jazz by listening to records by Earl Hines. He attended John Adams High School and Glenville High School. Lerner was introduced to jazz pianist Art Tatum at a Cleveland Club, and was \\"blown away\\" by the man's skill as a jazz player.Lerner, Al. Vamp Til Ready, 2007, Lerner then traveled in search of work, going to Miami Beach but the job fell through, so he then went to Havana, Cuba, aboard The Cuba. When he returned to the United States, he got a call from Harry James, who invited Lerner to join his band in New York. There, Lerner discovered that James wanted to have an unheard-of two pianos in his band, with Lerner playing one, and Jack Gardner the other. With a steady job, Lerner proposed to his Cleveland girlfriend, Ruth Levkovitz, and they married on June 15, 1941, and settled in New York, though Lerner spent much of his time on the road with the band, doing 50 and 60 one-night-stands at a time. In 1941, when Ray Bolger (later the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz) was a featured act with the James band at the Paramount Theatre in New York, Lerner and Bolger would do a \\"challenge\\" tap dance as part of the show. When Glenn Miller enlisted in the Army, his band was not able to perform on the Chesterfield Hour radio program, after which the Harry James Band was chosen. This meant a major increase in salary for Lerner, up to $75/week. With the exposure on the radio show, the band also began getting work in the film industry, such as in Private Buckaroo and Springtime in the Rockies. The band got more attention, and was regularly on the move, from New York to Los Angeles and back again. It was during this time that Lerner began composing, such as writing an instrumental with Harry James, \\"Music Makers\\", which became the band's theme. When the James Band finally broke up in 1944, Lerner stayed in Los Angeles and joined with singer Dick Haymes, with whom he worked for the next thirteen years as musical director. Over the course of his career, Lerner worked with many artists from the Big Band era of music, such as Charlie Barnet, Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Rosemary Clooney, Kay Starr, and Pat Boone. He played with the Harry James band at the Paramount Theater in 1940, featuring Bea Wain, has performed at Carnegie Hall, and was conductor at a Royal Command Performance for Queen Elizabeth in 1954 at the London Palladium, in a benefit for the Variety Artistes Benevolent Fund. Lyricists that he has worked with include Frankie Laine. In 1961, he composed the music for \\"So Until I See You\\", with lyrics by Victor Gari Corpora. The music was used as the closing theme of the Jack Paar Show. It was recorded by singer David Lucas for Arwin Records. Lerner's first wife, Ruth Levkovitz Lerner, died in 1986. In 1991 he remarried, and as of 2014, Lerner was living in Palm Desert, California, with his wife, Jonne. He has two children by his first marriage. Al Lerner died January 19, 2014, from Prostate Cancer at Eisenhower Hospital in Rancho Mirage, CA. He was 94. At the time of his death he was the sole surviving member of the Harry James Orchestra of the early 1940s.

Started in the 15th century, the house has been modified many times and is a Grade I listed building, currently operated as a country house hotel. History In the early 12th century the manor of Chilston is recorded as being the property of William Fitz-Hamon. It became the property of the Hoese or Hussey family in the 13th century, who held it until 1545, when it was sold to John Parkhurst. After his descendant Sir William Parkhurst sold the manor to Richard Northwood of Thanet, it passed quickly through the possession of several owners before becoming the property of Edward Hales in 1650. Hales was a nephew of Sir Edward Hales and was briefly MP for Hythe in 1685 and 1689. He died in 1696 and his daughters sold the house in 1698 to Elizabeth Hamilton, widow of James Hamilton and mother of James Hamilton, 6th Earl of Abercorn. Chilson Mannor by Thomas Baderslade, 1719, showing the house from the north with extensive formal gardens Elizabeth Hamilton died in 1709 and is buried in the church at Hollingbourne. The estate was inherited by her younger son William Hamilton, who left it on his death in 1737 to his son John Hamilton. He sold the estate to Thomas Best, MP for Canterbury (1741-54 and 1761-68). The next owner was his nephew George Best, MP for Rochester (1790-96). Following Best's death in 1819, the house was bought by George Douglas, passing to James Stoddart Douglas, MP for Rochester (1841-47), and then to a distant relative Aretas Akers in 1875. Akers, who was MP for East Kent (1880-85) then St Augustine's (1885-1911), added Douglas to his family name. He was Home Secretary from 1902 to 1905 and, in 1911, was created Viscount Chilston. Chilston Park remained in the Akers-Douglas family until the estate was sold by the fourth viscount in 1983. Since then, the house and most of the parkland have been used as a country-house hotel. Buildings Chilston Park house is a two-storey, red- brick building with an attic floor in the roof. It was begun in the late 15th century or early 16th century as a courtyard house and was altered in each of the subsequent three centuries. The courtyard was infilled in the 1880s and the house now forms a single block. The symmetrical front fa√ßade to the north is nine windows wide and features two projecting side bays and a pedimented central bay with a Diocletian window. A modillioned cornice runs above the first floor and over the pediment. The central bay, which contains the entrance, was reconstructed in 1728 to replace an earlier three-storied porch. The 12-paned sash windows in this fa√ßade are replacements installed in the late 17th or early 18th century and are recessed with stone sills and rubbed brick voussoirs. The roof, hipped to the front, gabled to the rear and with dormers on each outer slope, was replaced in the same period as the front fa√ßade windows. Grazing deer before Chilston Park, Kent by Frederick Richard Lee, a 19th-century view of the house across the larger of the two lakes The modillioned cornice continues on the east fa√ßade, which is generally symmetrical about a central doorway apart a projecting bay on the north end. The south fa√ßade features gabled stone-built bays at each end with brick surrounds to the windows on each floor. The central section is built of brick in similar style to the east fa√ßade with the cornice repeated from the north and east sides. A brick conservatory with octagonal pyramidal roof projects south from the east end of the fa√ßade. The west wing was rebuilt after the Second World War. Internally, the entrance hall is early 18th century with a black-and-white stone floor. Four rooms have moulded plaster ceilings and cornices dated to the second quarter of the 18th century. The central staircase was installed when the courtyard was enclosed and features carved panelling from circa 1540, believed to be from Royton Chapel. To the west of the house, beyond a modern extension, is a single-storey stone-built stable from the 17th or early 18th century that was partly rebuilt in the 19th century. It flanks the north and west sides of a courtyard and part of the east side. Roofs are hipped, with an attic floor reached from an external stair. A mounting block on the east wing incorporates part of an early 16th- century fireplace with the arms of the Hussey family. To the south of the courtyard are two-storey stone-built coachman's cottages from the 18th century with brick dressings and a brick eaves cornice. The house, the stables and the mounting block are Grade I listed buildings. The coachman's cottages are listed Grade II.

On the north side, containing a stand of pine trees are separated from the rest of the park by the M20 motorway and Channel Tunnel Rail Link. To the north and south of the house are formal gardens, with a large, roughly rectangular lake located to the north of the house and a smaller one to the south. The east side of the garden is bordered by a ha-ha. A series of ponds that existed to the west of the house in the 18th century has been filled in. A circular pond and a ruined icehouse are located in the north-west of the park.

History Until the 19th century, Southend-on-Sea did not exist as a place, and the established centres of population were at Leigh-on-Sea to the west and Prittlewell to the north. However, it was developed as a bathing resort in the 18th century, and the first pier was constructed in 1830. This allowed passenger-carrying steamers to visit the town, but only at certain times. Consequently, the pier was extended to reach deep water in 1846, so that the steamers could visit at all states of the tide. A narrow gauge horse tramway was constructed along the pier in 1851, and the arrival of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway in 1854 led to the development of Southend as a holiday resort for Londoners and a dormitory town for people who worked in London. The pier tramway was electrified in 1890, with current supplied by a conductor rail, and the gauge of the tracks was . As the town expanded, there was a need for public transport, and so a gauge electric tramway, using overhead wires to supply the power, was constructed, and opened for business on 19 July 1901. Lines ran from Victoria Circus, at the top of the High Street, to Leigh-on-Sea and Southchurch. A branch ran from Southend Victoria railway station along Southchurch Avenue to reach the beach, while a circular route ran northwards along Victoria Avenue to Prittlewell, where it turned west along West Road, and then southwards along North Road to reach the Cricketers Hotel, where it rejoined the route to Leigh-on-Sea. The initial rolling stock consisted of three batches of trams, all built by the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Cars 1 to 10 were four-wheel vehicles, with a wheelbase of and an open upper deck. Cars 11 and 12 were 8-wheel vehicles, again with an open upper deck, while cars 13 and 14 had a single deck, and a wheelbase of . The Corporation ordered three more 8-wheel trams from Brush's in 1902. Cars 15 to 17 had open upper decks. The next batch of five trams, cars 18 to 22 were of a similar design, but were ordered from G.F. Milnes & Co. Robert Birkett became the general manager on 1 July 1905, and set about expanding the network and modernising the fleet. The seafront line was extended eastwards, reaching Bryant Avenue in August 1908, the \\"Halfway House\\" pub and Thorpe Hall Corner in 1909, and turning away from the sea to reach Thorpe Bay in February 1912. The route to Prittlewell was not proving to be profitable, and the section along North Road was abandoned in January 1912, with the tracks being lifted soon afterwards. The depot on London Road became an engineers workshop, where many of the early trams were rebuilt. The single deck cars 13 and 14 were rebuilt as open topped double decked cars between 1907 and 1909. The seating capacity of the 4-wheeled trams was increased from 38 to 62. Car 6 had extra bulkheads built at the end of the lower saloon, and the upper deck was extended over the driver's position. Several other cars were cut in half and an extra window section inserted. This increased the wheelbase from to , and again, the upper deck was extended to form a canopy for the driver. Cars 3, 5, 8 and 11 were fitted with replacement open topped bodies, and the original trucks were reconditioned. New 8-wheeled cars, numbered 23 to 25 were ordered in 1909 from the United Electric Car Company of Preston, who had taken over Milnes, and six more 4-wheeled, open topped cars were built by Brush in 1910. They were numbered 26 to 31, to be followed by two more batches, cars 33 to 36 and 37 to 39, which were of a similar design, and were delivered by Brush in 1912. Electrical power for the tramway was supplied by a generating station located near the London Road depot, and it was decided to transport coal from the coal pier on the seafront to the generating station along the tramway. The Corporation owned a small loading pier on the sea front, near to the gas works, and this was rebuilt in 1914, incorporating a spur to enable trams to run onto it. Three 4-wheel coal trams, numbered 1A to 3A, were built by Grenshaw & Piers of Bolton, with cabs at both ends, and two large \\"V\\"-skips between them. They were painted grey, and worked from 1915 until the early 1930s, when the steam engines at the power station were replaced by diesel generators. The original generating sets produced 200 kilowatts each, and were driven by vertical compound Corliss steam engines. The cylinders were in diameter with a stroke, and drove the generators at 110 rpm. All of the tramcars used swivel head trolleys, to pick up the power from the overhead wires. These had the advantage that the wires did not need to be above the centre line of the track, and presented a less cluttered appearance in the streets, particularly when there was double track. Further extensions to the system occurred in the run up to World War I. The tracks along Southchurch Road were extended eastwards to Bournes Green in 1913, and in 1914, they were extended again to join up with the tracks at Thorpe Bay. This created a circular route to the east of Southend. Unlike most of the rest of the system, these extensions were created on separate rights of way, rather than along roads, and the double track boulevards were lined with trees. Four single deck toastrack cars were ordered from Brush Engineering in 1914 for use on the circular route, to be numbered 40 to 43, but only the first three arrived before the onset of the war, and the fourth one was not delivered until 1921. The Corporation also took delivery of a batch of 12 8-wheeled vehicles from Brush in 1921, and for the first time the top deck was enclosed. They were numbered 44 to 55. The final batch of six new trams was built by English Electric in 1923, carrying the fleet numbers 56 to 61. A large amount of refurbishment work took place between 1925 and 1927, with many of the open topped vehicles receiving a roof on the upper deck, and later windscreens were added to protect the driver from the elements. The route along the boulevards was thought to be unprofitable, and there were attempts within the council to stop the service during the winter months. The tramways department paid the wages of six gardeners to maintain the gardens along the route, and profitability returned when the gardeners were transferred to the parks department. Pictures of the boulevards give an impression of woodland, rather than an urban tramway, and this impression was further enhanced by the planting of grass between the rails. The English Electric trams were the last new-build trams bought by the Corporation, but in 1934 they purchased some second-hand vehicles. Cars 62 to 65 came from the Middlesbrough Corporation Tramways system when that closed, and had been built by Hurst Nelson in 1921. They had two decks, with a roof on the upper deck, but open balconies at either end. The Middlesbrough system had a track gauge of , and the trams had to be regauged on arrival at Southend. Cars 66 to 68 came from Accrington Corporation Tramways, and had been built by Brush in 1919-1920. They were fully enclosed double deck trams, with 8 wheels, and again had to be regauged, as the Accrington system was gauge. Decline In 1925, the Corporation looked at replacing the trams with trolleybuses. Two vehicles were hired for evaluation, and were used to supplement the trams on the route to Prittlewell. The trial proved to be successful, and trolleybuses replaced the trams on that route on 28 December 1928. More trolleybuses were purchased, and trams were withdrawn and scrapped to reduce the size of the fleet. By 1938, much of the track was in poor condition and in need of renewal. The northern part of the eastern loop, from Southchurch to Thorpe Bay, closed on 6 July 1938, though in this case the trams were replaced by motorbuses, and trolleybuses took over on the seafront section from the Kursaal to Thorpe Bay on 3 June 1939. The rest of the system would probably have been closed soon afterwards, but the advent of World War II delayed the closure programme, and the system lasted until 8 April 1942. The Light Railway Transport League organised a farewell visit on 8 February 1942. The trolleybuses lasted until 28 October 1954, when pressure for an integrated transport network based on the motor bus caused their demise. Infrastructure The system had its hub at Victoria Circus, with a small loop around Southchurch Road, Chichester Road, Warrior Square and the High Street. From this hub the routes were: * opened July 1901 - along Victoria Avenue, West Street, North Road, London Road returning to Victoria Circus. In 1912 most of the North Road section was closed, leaving a terminus just off West Street at grid reference . * opened July 1901 - along Southchurch Road, Southchurch Avenue to the esplanade. * opened August 1901 - along London Road, Leigh Road and Broadway to a terminus in Leigh-on-Sea at grid reference adjacent to St Clement's Church. * opened August 1908 - extension along the esplanade to The Halfway House. * opened February 1912 - extension along the esplanade to Thorpe Bay. * opened July 1913 - along Southchurch Road, Southchurch Boulevard to Bournes Green. * opened July 1914 - extension from Bournes Green to Thorpe Bay to complete the loop. * opened 1914 - spur from the esplanade onto the newly rebuilt Corporation Loading Pier at grid reference . The depot was on London Road at grid reference , which is now the site of the London Road Retail Park. Tramcars The fleet, in a livery of cream and green, consisted of: * 65 double deck tramcars. * 6 single deck tramcars.

Anita's early years as an Officer Anita in formal uniform Early years Anita Vel√°stegui was born into a family of agricultural producers and distributors in Ambato, where she grew up together with three brothers and one sister. She attended primary school at the ‚ÄúCevallos‚Äù Primary School and Middle and High school at the ‚ÄúColegio Nacional Ambato‚Äù all-girls school where she completed her secondary education. Influenced by her father she took up the field of dentistry and studied in Ecuador's largest National University, the Central University of Ecuador in Quito. In 1974 Anita applied to the Ecuadorian Army, in response to a recruitment advertisement as the army was in search of graduates of several career fields of the health services branch. Army career She started her career as a first lieutenant and was initially posted in the southern city of Cuenca. She would later serve also in posts at El Oro province and in Cayambe, Pichincha province. Eventually she was assigned to the Armed Forces' National Hospital, where she served as a dentist for many years. Whilst in service at this hospital, she was promoted to captain, major and lieutenant colonel. After 20 years of service Anita was one of the first three female officers that were promoted to the rank of Colonel (the highest rank that a services branch officer could reach by the law of the day) in the Ecuadorian armed forces. Among the three she had the best overall grades. Shortly after her promotion she was appointed Director of the Health Services Department of the Ministry of Defense. She retired from this position after 25 years of service. Present day After retirement, Anita has devoted herself to a lifelong passion: painting, and had attended many painting courses mostly through the Ecuadorian Cultural Institute (Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana). Over the years she has created a small painting collection with over 50 works which have been exhibited in different galleries.

It was acquired by Imperial Chemical Industries from Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. in 1987. In 1987, Stauffer's head office was in Westport, Connecticut. Late that year, Imperial sold Stauffer's basic chemicals business to Rh√¥ne-Poulenc S.A. History The company was founded in 1885 in San Francisco as a partnership between two young Europeans; a German, John Stauffer, Sr., and a Frenchman, Christian de Guigne. Ships exporting wheat to Europe used stone from the chalk cliffs of Dover as ballast. This discarded ballast became the inexpensive raw material for the newly formed company. The company was incorporated by John Stauffer, Sr., who died on March 4, 1940 at the age of 78. In 1931, the company announced plans for a new manufacturing subsidiary, the Pacific Hard Rubber Company. Hans Stauffer, nephew of founder John Stauffer, Sr, who joined his uncle at Stauffer Chemicals in 1920 and who retired as president in 1967, died in 1986. John Stauffer Jr., director emeritus of the company and son of the company‚Äôs founder, died in 1972. The John Stauffer Laboratory for Physical Chemistry, the John Stauffer Chemistry Building at Stanford University, and the John Stauffer Science Center at Whittier College are all named after him. Pollution and site contamination A Stauffer Chemical factory in Tarpon Springs, Florida in Pinellas County (), produced elemental phosphorus from phosphate ore operated from 1947 until 1981. The factory was originally operated by Victor Chemical Company, and was acquired by Stauffer Chemical in 1960. The United States Environmental Protection Agency reported that \\"Site operations resulted in the contamination of soils, ground water, and waste ponds on the property. The main contaminants of concern (COCs) in soil include arsenic, antimony, beryllium, elemental phosphorus, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), radium-226, and thallium.\\" 1982 and 1983 earnings dispute In 1984, the company was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of overstating its 1982 and 1983 earnings through non-standard accounting. Phosphorus trichloride plant The company was in the headlines in the mid-1980s for selling its design for a chemical plant to make phosphorus trichloride to Krebs A.G., a Swiss company. The plant modeled after a Stauffer plant in Pennsylvania, was subsequently built by Krebs for El Nasr Pharmaceutical Company of Egypt. Phosphorus trichloride is well known for its dual use capacity as a starting material for pesticide products as well as Sarin. A Cordesman (1996).

Background  The Cornaro Atlas is an 80-page Venetian manuscript volume, estimated to date c. 1489. It is named after the Cornaro family, one of the leading patrician families of the Republic of Venice, who once owned the volume, and whose coat of arms adorns its frontispiece. The Cornaro Atlas was brought to England in 1832, and is currently held (Egerton MS 73) by the British Library in London, UK. The first half of the volume contains a large collection of nautical charts, faithful copies of portolan charts composed earlier in the 15th century. The second half of the volume is dedicated to a myriad of written tracts on matters of nautical interest (e.g. astronomy, sailing directions, tariffs, etc.)  Contents of the Atlas  The Cornaro atlas has around 80 pages, each page at 53 x 41 cm.  Calendars  Three of the pages are calendars: * (p. 1) ‚Äì a perpetual astronomical calendar of lunar revolutions * (p. 2) ‚Äì a calendar of moveable feasts from 1489 to 1600 * (p. 79) ‚Äì a calendar of Dominical letters.  Nautical charts  Following the opening calendars, there are 38 nautical charts depicted in 35 pages (numbered p. 3 to p. 38).The charts of the Cornaro Atlas are numbered 69‚Äì104 in Uzielli & Amat di San Filippo (1892: p.82ff), whose numbers are sometimes reference elswewhere. But here we follow the page numbering of d'Avezac (1850) and the COPAC entry at the British Library. All the maps seem to have been copied around the same time and by the same hand.D'Avezac (1850: p.16) Several pages can be grouped together to form a single portolan chart covering the \\"normal portolan\\" range (Black Sea, Mediterranean and Atlantic coast up to the British isles). Most cartographers are named, some of them notables, such as Grazioso Benincasa of Ancona and Petrus Rosell of Majorca, others are lesser known. The last few charts are anonymous. Notable in this collection are the final charts on West Africa (\\"Portuguese Guinea\\") by an anonymous cartographer (often attributed to Cristoforo Soligo), which seem to be based on a Portuguese nautical chart. It is one of the few indicators of the existence of Portuguese portolans from before the earliest extant specimens. * (3 + 4) ‚Äì portolan chart of Petrus Rosell ** p. 3 ‚Äì chart of east Mediterranean and Black Sea ** p. 4 ‚Äì chart of west Mediterranean and Atlantic coast *(5 + 6) ‚Äì portolan chart of Giovanni de Napoli (Zuan de Napoli) ** p. 5 ‚Äì east Mediterranean and Black Sea. ** p. 6 ‚Äì west Mediterranean and Atlantic coast *(7 + 8) ‚Äì portolan chart of Grazioso Benincasa ** p. 7 ‚Äì east Mediterranean and Black Sea ** p. 8 ‚Äì west Mediterranean and Atlantic coast *(p. 9) ‚Äì two charts on one page: ** the first is a special map of the Black Sea by Grazioso Benincasa (or F.

He began to take black and white photographs of actors in his small flat in the Cour de Petites Ecuries. He later had exhibitions of his landscape photographs in caf√©s and galleries around Paris. His work on photographing urban landscapes was seen by a development company who in 1987 commissioned him to photograph a number of large construction projects around Paris. This was followed by work as a documentary film-maker in London where he produced a film called The Millennium Wheel. This time-lapse documentary charts the building of the tallest observation wheel in Europe, the London Eye. It was screened at the London Film Festival and on Channel 4 on the eve of the new Millennium. Robinson has contributed a number of special time-lapse sequences and stills for various films including Millions (Danny Boyle, 2004) and Wonderland (Revolution Films, 1999). He also did some time-lapse sequences for a number of TV mini series including Castle (2003), and Tory! Tory! Tory! (2006). His most recent project has been documenting the rebuilding of the World Trade Center towers (including One World Trade Center (or 1 WTC). His studio is based in the empty 46th floor of Larry Silverstein's World Trade Center Tower #3 which is next to 1 WTC with views that stretch across New York Harbor and up to Midtown.

Campaign against the Sut√ª  The most significant event of his reign appears to have been his aggressive campaign against the Sut√ª, a nomadic people along the middle Euphrates related to the Arameans, and is described in the Chronicle P, in a somewhat garbled passage which superimposes events relating to the accession of Kurigalzu II, four generations later. He claims to have ‚Äúannihilated their extensive forces\\", then constructed fortresses in a mountain region called ·∏™i·∏´i, in the Syrian desert as security outposts, and ‚Äúhe dug wells and settled people on fertile lands, to strengthen the guard‚Äù. These events seem to be confirmed in the opening six lines of text from an unpublished kudurru in the Yale Babylonian CollectionKudurru YBC 2242. which describes his efforts to expel the Suteans from Babylonia. It has been suggested that the Babylonian work ‚ÄúKing of all Habitations‚Äù, which is commonly referred to as the Epic of the plague-god Erra, is a Kassite period-piece which includes the description of a raid on Uruk by the Sut√ª and the subsequent cries for vengeance upon them.

The population of the civil parish was 129 at the 2011 census. It is situated approximately south-west from the town of Grimsby. History There are two scheduled barrows south-west of Riby Grove Farm. Whilst they are no longer visible above ground, the burial remains survive inside. One is a Neolithic long barrow, and the other a Bronze Age bowl barrow. A hoard of 15-20,000 bronze coins dating from Gallienus to Aurelian (AD 253-275) were found in an urn covered by a dish at Riby Wold Farm in 1953. The coins are held by the Ashmolean Museum pending classification. Lincoln Museum hold a further collection of 21 coins, Constantine - Gratian (AD 305-383), thought to be only part of a hoard found at Riby. The parish church is a Grade II* listed building dedicated to Saint Edmund and dating from the 12th century with an 1868 restoration by Ferrey, and built from limestone and ironstone. The west door is late 13th-century, and there is a blocked 12th- century door in the north aisle. The east window records that George Tomline funded the restoration, and there are several memorials to the Tomline family in the church. On 18 June 1645, there was a civil war clash at Riby Gapp, and the parish register of Riby contains the following entries: > \\"Nine soldiers slaine in a skirmish in the field of Riby the day before, > buried June the 19th.\\" \\"Charles Skelton, a soldiour wounded in the same > skirmish, buried June the 20th.\\" \\"William Willoughbie a soldier wounded in > the skirmish above named, buried July the 4th\\" Riby Grove was a country house, now demolished, which stood in the village. In 1803 Marmaduke Tomline, owner of the Riby Grove, bequeathed the house and estate to George Pretyman, the Bishop of Lincoln, on condition that he adopted the name Tomline. Pretyman accepted the inheritance and thereafter adopted the name Pretyman-Tomline. His son William Edward Pretyman Tomline was born at Riby in 1787 and became a Member of Parliament and High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1824‚Äì25. He in turn had a son \\"Colonel\\" George Tomline, also a Member of Parliament and High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1852. The house was demolished in 1935. Riby School was built in 1890 as Riby National school, replacing a village school built in 1848 by the Tomline family. It was known as Riby County School by 1947 and closed in 1958.
