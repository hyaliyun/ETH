Focusing on a dozen characters and life's pivotal moments rather than on a linear plot, O'Brien follows the ensemble cast (which includes a Vietnam vet, a draft dodger, a minister, a bigamous housewife and a manufacturer of mops) for whom \\"the world had whittled itself down to now or never,\\" as they drink, flirt and reminisce. Interspersed are tales of other moments when each character experienced something that changed him or her forever. Jumping across decades, O'Brien reveals past loves and old betrayals that still haunt: Dorothy failed to follow Billy to Canada; Spook hammered out a \\"double marriage\\"; Ellie saw her lover drown; Paulette, in a moment of desperation, disgraced herself and ruined her career.

It is located at the International Arctic Research base, Ny-√Ölesund. It was inaugurated on the 1st of July, 2008 by the Minister of Earth Sciences. It was set up during India's second Arctic expedition in June 2008. It is located at a distance of from the North Pole.  Research Goals  Himadri's functions include long term monitoring of the fjord (Kongsfjorden) dynamics, and atmospheric research. The primary goals of India's research includes research on aerosol radiation, space weather, food- web dynamics, microbial communities, glaciers, sedimentology, and carbon recycling. The research base has devoted time for the research of governance and policy of the Arctic. India has prioritised research and study in the fields of genetics, glaciology, geology, pollution in the atmosphere, and space weather among other fields. In 2012‚Äì2013, a total of 25 scientists visited the base which was staffed for 185 days to carry out studies under 10 distinct projects.  Strategic Interests  The United States Geological Survey estimates that 22% of the world's oil and natural gas could be located beneath the Arctic. India's ONGC Videsh is reported to be interested in joint- venture with Russia for oil exploration and has reportedly requested Rosneft for stake in a project. In addition, using Arctic sea lanes for shipping would reduce voyage times by 40% compared to Indian, Pacific or Atlantic Ocean routes. On 15 May 2013, India was made a permanent observer at the Arctic Council. India is the 11th country after Britain, Germany, France, Italy, China, Japan, South Korea, The Netherlands, Sweden and Norway to set up a permanent research station in Ny-√Ölesund.

Wilson was educated at Yale University, receiving an A.B. in 1897. After college, Wilson joined the United States Consular and Diplomatic Service, becoming a Second Secretary at the United States Legation in Tokyo. He was promoted to First Secretary in 1900 and then to Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires in 1901. He married Lucy Wortham James in 1904. The couple would divorce in 1915. Wilson returned to the United States in 1906, becoming Third Assistant Secretary of State in Washington, D.C., and the Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Consular and Diplomatic Service. With the outbreak of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt named Wilson Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Ottoman Empire. He was also sent on a mission to Argentina. Returning to the U.S. again in 1909, Wilson became the United States Assistant Secretary of State during the Taft administration, which at the time was the second-ranking position in the State Department, after Secretary of State Philander C. Knox. Knox, in addition to being ignorant of foreign affairs, was very lax about his official duties, and Wilson was, in his own words, \\"frequently left in charge of the Department for months at a time.\\" In this capacity, Wilson was responsible for drawing up and implementing a reorganization of the United States Department of State. Wilson attempted to retire due to factors inside the State Department but was persuaded to remain for another two years.https://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/fmhw_other/212/ Wilson retired from government service in 1913 and settled in Philadelphia. There, he wrote for the Public Ledger and the Evening Bulletin.

A total of nine known tropical systems developed during the season, with the earliest forming on June 21, and the last dissipating on October 31. On two occasions during the season, two tropical cyclones simultaneously existed with one another; the first time on August 2, and the second on October 9. Records show that 1867 featured two tropical storms, six hurricanes and one major hurricane (Category 3+). However, in the absence of modern satellite and other remote-sensing technologies, only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded, so the actual total could be higher. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated. Of the known 1867 cyclones Hurricanes Three, Four and Six plus Tropical Cyclones Five and Eight were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez-Partagas and Henry Diaz. Hurricane One was first identified in 2003 by Cary Mock. The strongest storm of the season was Hurricane Nine, or the San Narciso hurricane. It developed in the Central Atlantic, and moved west to impact the Leeward Islands and Greater Antilles. The storm system was a major Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, meaning the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 111‚Äì130 mph (178‚Äì209 km/h). This was the costliest, and deadliest, storm of the season, causing at least $1 million (1867 USD) in damage, and at least 800 deaths across the Caribbean Sea. __TOC__ Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/06/1867 till:01/12/1867 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/06/1867 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_‚â§39_mph_(‚â§62_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39‚Äì73_mph_(63‚Äì117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74‚Äì95_mph_(118‚Äì153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96‚Äì110_mph_(154‚Äì177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111‚Äì129_mph_(178‚Äì208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130‚Äì156_mph_(209‚Äì251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_‚â•157_mph_(‚â•252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:21/06/1867 till:23/06/1867 color:C1 text:\\"One (C1)\\" from:28/07/1867 till:03/08/1867 color:C2 text:\\"Two (C2)\\" from:02/08/1867 till:02/08/1867 color:C2 text:\\"Three (C2)\\" from:31/08/1867 till:03/09/1867 color:C1 text:\\"Four (C1)\\" from:08/09/1867 till:08/09/1867 color:TS text:\\"Five (TS)\\" from:29/09/1867 till:01/10/1867 color:C2 text:\\"Six (C2)\\" from:02/10/1867 till:09/10/1867 color:C2 text:\\"Seven (C2)\\" barset:break from:09/10/1867 till:09/10/1867 color:TS text:\\"Eight (TS)\\" from:27/10/1867 till:31/10/1867 color:C3 text:\\"Nine (C3)\\" bar:Month width:15 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/06/1867 till:01/07/1867 text:June from:01/07/1867 till:01/08/1867 text:July from:01/08/1867 till:01/09/1867 text:August from:01/09/1867 till:01/10/1867 text:September from:01/10/1867 till:01/11/1867 text:October from:01/11/1867 till:01/12/1867 text:November TextData = pos:(570,30) text:\\"(From the\\" pos:(617,30) text:\\"Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale)\\" Systems Hurricane One On the morning of June 21, a tropical storm formed approximately east northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida. Initially below hurricane strength with a maximum sustained wind speed of , the tropical storm moved almost due north, while strengthening steadily. By the early hours of June 22, the system had intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, while moving slowly east northeastward. Early on June 23 the hurricane made landfall east of the city of Charleston, South Carolina, with peak winds of . In Charleston a number of roofs were blown away, trees were uprooted and wharves damaged. Outside the city there was considerable damage to crops due to heavy rainfall. Weakening steadily, the system's last known location was near Raleigh, North Carolina, on June 23. Hurricane Two The bark St. Ursula observed a hurricane about 375 mi (600 km) east-northeast of Dominica of July 28. Tracking generally northwestward, the storm changed little in intensity until located to the north of Grand Turk. From there, it proceeded northwestward, and intensified to near Category 1 hurricane status. As it moved to the southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina, the storm attained its peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of , based on observations from a ship located about east of Norfolk, Virginia. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone commenced re-curving to the northeast and began a weakening trend, falling to Category 1 strength by early on August 2\\\\. Further weakening occurred while the hurricane was located to the west of Sable Island. The storm was last reported to the south of Cape Race on the island of Newfoundland on August 3\\\\. The town of Marblehead, Massachusetts, recorded 11 deaths after a fishing schooner went missing in a gale near Sable Island.Ancestry.com.

Massachusetts Vital and Town Records. Provo, UT: Holbrook Research Institute (Jay and Delene Holbrook). On Nantucket, the island reported gale-force winds from the southeast, torrential rainfall, and waves washing over hills. The winds damaged crops, especially corn and garden vegetables, while toppling large trees, chimneys, and fences. Waves displaced \\"millions of loads of sand\\" into Hummock Pond, while also cutting a channel from the pond into the ocean. At least two additional deaths occurred offshore the East Coast of the United States after a brig sank. Hurricane Three Early on August 2, a hurricane developed over the central Caribbean Sea. The storm reached an estimated peak intensity of , making it a Category 2 hurricane. The report of the hurricane was based on observations from the ship Suwanee, with no other reports available. Hurricane Four Late on August 31, a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of was reported over the Central Atlantic. Moving generally north to north-northeast, the storm gained no intensity over the next day or so as it passed between the United States East Coast and Bermuda. Late on September 2, the storm retained tropical storm status as it paralleled the coast of Washington, D.C. Retracing to the east at an increasing forward speed, the storm system held its intensity of for the rest of its existence. Observations from the ship Helen R. Cooper confirm that this storm was in fact a hurricane. Tropical Storm Five Early on September 8, the schooner Matilda encountered a tropical cyclone two hundred miles to the east of the Leeward Islands. The storm's recorded wind speeds reached no more than , and there were no further reports of it on subsequent days. Hurricane Six Late on September 29, a Category 1 hurricane formed several hundred miles north of the Bahamas. Tracking to the north, the storm system gained very little strength while passing several hundred miles southwest of Savannah, Georgia. It reportedly attained Category 2 hurricane status while located approximately to the east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with winds peaking at . Spinning to the north-northeast, the hurricane eventually entered a weakening phase, and its last reported location was approximately northeast of Virginia Beach, Virginia. This hurricane never made landfall.  Hurricane Seven  The Galveston Hurricane of 1867 Late on October 2, a hurricane formed in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of northeastern Mexico. Holding its intensity, the storm system paralleled the Texas coastline, causing \\"many\\" deaths. A storm tide value of was reported in Ludlum (1963), and it is possible that Brownsville, Texas, was in the western eyewall of the hurricane at the storms closest approach. Turning towards Louisiana, the storm made landfall on the state with winds of , a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. Moving to the east and weakening, the storm made landfall on the state of Florida during the day on October 6. Holding its strength while crossing the Sunshine state, the tropical storm re- emerged into Atlantic waters. Taking a slight turn to the north, it dissipated off the coast of North Carolina on October 9. The hurricane struck Texas, near the mouth of the Rio Grande, and devastated Brownsville, Matamoros, and Bagdad. Because of the devastating effects in these three, state authorities sought help from the governors of Nuevo Le√≥n and Coahuila. The governor of Nuevo Le√≥n authorized the state to send over 100 bushels of corn; Coahuila's sent 500 loads of flour. Relief was also sent from Veracruz in two vessels. Agriculturalists in Matamoros were allowed to send their goods to Monterrey for storage. The entire population of Bagdad fled, while Matamoros was left nearly in ruins. The official death toll in the area was unknown, but local accounts stated there were at least 26 dead. Entire families disappeared from the area too. Most buildings in Brazos Santiago were leveled. Clarksville, two miles inland, was also devastated and shortly later abandoned. Galveston, already in the midst of a yellow fever epidemic, was flooded by a storm surge. The mainland rail bridge, a hotel and hundreds of homes in the city were washed away. Twelve schooners and a river steamboat were wrecked in the bay there and wharves destroyed. On October 3 high seas and heavy rains flooded New Orleans. Bath houses and a saw mill there were blown away. Houses were also swept away at Milneberg and at Pilottown, Louisiana. The Ship Shoal Light was damaged while the Shell Keys lighthouse was destroyed and its keeper killed. High winds and heavy rainfall continued across southeast Louisiana until October 6, inflicting great damage on crops.Early American hurricanes 1492-1870, David Ludlum, pg 179-182 Tropical Storm Eight This tropical storm is known from having wrecked the schooner Three Sisters on the night of October 9 at Saint Martin in the eastern Caribbean. It may also have been responsible for seven inches of rain falling on Barbados on October 7 but that is uncertain. It is estimated that the storm reached its peak with winds of on October 9. Hurricane Nine Hurricane San Narciso of 1867 The mail steamer Principe Alfonso first observed this cyclone about east-northeast of Barbuda around 00:00 UTC on October 27. Moving westward, the storm intensified, becoming a hurricane on the following day. The system further strengthened into a major hurricane, reaching Category 3 early on October 29\\\\. Around that time, the hurricane made landfall on Sombrero Island. The storm peaked with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a pressure of shortly before striking Saint Thomas in the United States Virgin Islands. Late on October 29, the hurricane struck northeastern Puerto Rico near Fajardo with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). The cyclone quickly weakened to a Category 1 over the island before emerging into the Mona Passage. On October 30, the system struck just southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, as a Category 1 hurricane. Mountainous terrain caused the storm to rapidly weaken and dissipate over Haiti on the following day. The hurricane left extensive impact in the British Virgin Islands, with the storm destroying about 100 homes on Virgin Gorda and 60 out of 123 homes on Tortola. Most sugar plantations and many crops were damaged. At least 39 deaths occurred in the British Virgin Islands, including 37 on Tortola and 2 on Peter Island. At Saint Thomas, the hurricane destroyed about 80 ships, including the RMS Rhone. On the island itself, the cyclone caused approximately 600 deaths. A death toll of 211, mostly due to drowning by floods or landslides, was reported on Puerto Rico, while the hurricane destroyed fourteen vessels and sixteen bridges on the island. Extensive damage occurred to the Puerto Rico's agriculture. In Dominican Republic, the cyclone nearly destroyed the city of Santo Domingo and caused about 200 additional deaths.

Background  In 1979, the Chinese government introduced the one- child policy, which legally prevents couples from having more than one child, though there are some exemptions. The policy was created to address the country's overpopulation issue and economic problems. By 2010, family planning efforts in Puning had diminished due to rapid economic growth in the area, as Guangdong had become the most successful manufacturing region in the People's Republic of China. However, local family planning officials were pressured to reduce births to meet the nationwide quotas. Chen Hong-Ping, the regional Communist Party chief, launched the Iron Fist Campaign in order to meet these demands.  Campaign  In April 2010, a task force of approximately 600 local officials targeted 9,559 women who had violated the country's one-child policy. The women were required to report to government clinics to undergo sterilization. Family members of those women who had refused sterilization were detained indefinitely until the women complied with the procedure. In some cases, the women themselves were detained. Over the course of the 20-day campaign, 1,377 people were detained. From April to June, over 9,000 women were reported to have been sterilized as a result of the campaign.  Criticism  News of the campaign did not make major headlines outside of local newspapers. He Yafu, an independent expert on family planning in China, suggested that the central government made an effort to conceal the results of the campaign because Chinese law specifically prohibited the means used to enforce it. Provincial officials have reported that the local Puning authorities will be investigated to determine the legality of their actions. Kate Allen of Amnesty International described the campaign as \\"appalling\\" and voiced her opinion that \\"authorities must condemn this practice immediately\\".

It is one of the best-preserved medieval castles in Saxony.  History  The castle was probably erected during the German eastward expansion under the regime of Emperor Barbarossa. It offered protection to the predominantly Frankish settlers in an area that was sparsely inhabited by Slavs. Under the protection of the castle, among others the trade city Reichenbach im Vogtland was founded. The 27 m (89 ft) tall Bergfried was built according to Romanesque style. The castle was built as hill castle with a single courtyard on a ridge of approximately 80 m (262 ft) long and 35 m (115 ft) wide, at the point where the Seifenbach flows into the G√∂ltzsch river. Originally four defense towers and a 22 m (44 ft) deep dry boat surrounded the castle. Inner courtyard Mylau and its castle, 1839 The first record of the Lords of Milin who inhabited the castle dates from 1214. As a result of the War of Vogtland (1354‚Äì1357), emperor Charles IV ordered them in 1367 to sell the castle to the Bohemic crown. That same year, he visited the castle and granted town privileges to the adjacent town of Mylau. Charles IV, whose relief in porphyry can be seen above the main entrance gate, instated a royal Bohemian office and began the expansion of the structure, which was continued by his sons Wenceslaus IV and Sigismund. Part of the castle was destroyed in 1400 due to a feud between Wenceslaus IV and the V√∂gte of the Vogtland. During the renovations, two large outer baileys were erected. In 1422, Sigismund pledged Mylau Castle to the prince-elector of Saxony in gratitude for his services during the Hussite Wars. The castle would remain in the hands of the Saxons, except between 1547 and 1569 when a burgrave was appointed over the Vogtland. One of the members of the rotating burgraves was Joseph Levin von Metzsch (1507‚Äì1571), a friend of Martin Luther. In the late 16th century, the aristocratic Thuringian-Saxon Von Sch√∂nberg family owned the castle. It was no longer used for defense purposes, but received a residential destination. In 1772, following a large reconstruction, it lost its aristocratic estate and has been privately held since. Between 1808 and 1828 it housed the first factory in northern Vogtland of local spinning magnate Christian Gotthelf Br√ºckner (1769‚Äì1834). The various owners of the castle had it expanded and renovated various times before it became municipal property in 1982. In the late 19th century, a foundation had the castle rebuilt in historic style to serve as city hall, tavern and museum.  Attractions and current use  The many modifications in earlier and more recent history makes Mylau Castle a melting pot of styles. The museum that opened in 1883 contains the largest natural history collection in the Vogtland. It furthermore offers an expositions on the construction of the G√∂ltzsch Viaduct and it provides information on the regional geology and mining. In 1899/1900, a room was dedicated to the aristocratic Metzsch family, who have long owned the castle. The most representative room of the castle is the council chamber, which was inspired by the Wartburg. From the castle's Market Gate, the Imperial Path leads up to the imperial court, along which 13 panels explain the castle's most remarkable features and describe the time under the emperors and Bohemian kings Charles IV, Wenceslaus IV and Sigismund. Aside from the museum, the castle houses offices.

It is most closely related to the Maonan language. Chadong has only been recently described by Chinese linguist Jinfang Li in the 1990s and 2000s. Speakers are classified as part of Han nationality (although their languages is Kra-Dai members). (source : Ethnologue) History According to inscriptions from the Ming dynasty, Chadong speakers originally came from Qingyuanfu, Nandan, Guangxi, which is located further to the west. They were originally sent to the Guilin area during the Yuan Dynasty in order to suppress local Zhuang and Yao rebellions. Genetics Qiongying Deng and Chuan-Chao Wang et al. have reported that most of the patrilineal and matrilineal gene pools of Chadong are characteristic lineages of southern China. Some ancient Southeast Asian lineages (Y chromosome haplogroups C and D, mtDNA haplogroups M*, M33, M74, and R*) were also identified in Chadong. Chadong shows patterns of the Y chromosome and mtDNA diversities similar to other southern populations, especially Kam-Sui populations, which was actually in accordance with linguistic classification. However, the origin of Chadong seems to be much more complex. Recent gene flow from Sino-Tibetan populations is detected in the patrilineal side of Chadong, such as Y chromosome haplogroups O3a1c-002611, O3a2c1*-M134, and O3a2c1a-M117, probably through the expansion and dispersal of Han Chinese. From the matrilineal aspect, most mtDNA haplogroups of Chadong also clustered together with Hmong-Mien, and obvious gene flow from Tibeto-Burman populations to Chadong was also observed in haplogroup F1a. Taken together, the origin of Chadong are mainly results of an admixture between surrounding populations with the indigenous Kam-Sui populations. Within the Kam-Sui populations, Chadong is more closely related to Mulam than to Maonan, especially from the matrilineal side.Deng QY*, Wang CC*, Wang XQ*, Wang LX, Wang ZY, Wu WJ, Li H, the Genographic Consortium. Genetic affinity between the Kam-Sui speaking Chadong and Mulam people. J Syst Evol. 2013, 51(3):263-270. Distribution In Liangjiang, the Chadong language is less conservative due to influences from Zhuang, Pinghua (Liangjiang Pinghua ‰∏§Ê±üÂπ≥ËØù dialect), and Southwestern Mandarin (Diller, et al. 2008). Chadong is spoken by 18,000 people in 98 villages, while there are 104 ethnic Chadong villages with 20,547 people as of 2000 (Li et al. 2012). *Chadong Ëå∂Ê¥û‰π°, Lingui County *Liangjiang ‰∏§Ê±üÈïá, Lingui County *Longjiang ÈæôÊ±ü‰π°, Yongfu County References *Li Rulong [ÊùéÂ¶ÇÈæô], Hou Xiaoying [‰æØÂ∞èËã±], Lin Tiansong [ÊûóÂ§©ÈÄÅ], Qin Kai [Áß¶ÊÅ∫]. 2012.

She is most notable for the Gonzales Cantata, a 40-minute choral piece in Baroque style that sets the text of the parts of the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy hearings in which former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales testified. It was featured on the Rachel Maddow Show in 2009; Maddow described it as \\"probably the coolest thing you've ever seen on this show.\\" Dunphy completed her doctoral degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 2014. Dunphy is the composer-in-residence for the Saint Louis Chamber Chorus, for which she has composed several a cappella choral works since her appointment in 2015. Gonzales Cantata Conceived while Dunphy was at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, the cantata has a libretto taken entirely from the transcript of the Gonzales hearings, which Dunphy found dramatic. Because Dunphy wished to highlight the fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee was made up entirely of men, with the exception of Dianne Feinstein - and also because there are more female opera singers than male - she reversed the genders and cast sopranos as Gonzales and as the male senators. Orrin Hatch is an alto, because he was more sympathetic to Gonzales and it needed \\"a different vibe\\"; Feinstein is a male tenor. The cantata includes an aria for Gonzales called \\"I Don't Recall,\\" in which the soprano sings the title phrase 72 times, the same number of times that Gonzales said it in the hearings. Dunphy reports that she asked John Ashcroft for permission to arrange his song \\"Let the Eagle Soar\\" as a \\"companion piece,\\" but he turned her down on grounds of \\"artistic differences.\\" The piece is generally Baroque in style, with some use of more modernist dissonance in the orchestration. Julian Sanchez described the cantata as \\"sort of like Henry Purcell filtered through late John Adams\\"; other reviewers mentioned its similarity to Handelian opera or to P.D.Q. Bach, or pointed out the use of \\"Coplandesque harmonies when characters were being folksy.\\" The work premiered at the Philadelphia Fringe Festival in September 2009. It was staged as a cantata or oratorio; characters wore red or blue dresses depending on party affiliation, with tiaras as well as sashes bearing their names. American Opera Theater staged the work as an opera in February 2011; reviews were less positive, with critics saying that Dunphy's parody of Baroque music compared unfavorably to P.D.Q. Bach and criticizing her out-of-period use of dissonance. Anne Midgette, criticizing the piece's lack of a coherent message, wrote, \\"Performed as a cantata, this piece may be an amusing diversion; staged as an opera, it reveals its dramatic deficiencies and loses some of its zany humor.\\" Selected other works *Black Thunder (2008) - work for baritone, violin, cello, and piano which received an honorable mention in the ASCAP/Lotte Lehmann Foundation 2009 Art Song Competition. *What do you think I fought for at Omaha Beach? (2010) - choral work to the text of public testimony by WWII veteran Philip Spooner in support of Maine's No on 1 campaign, which aimed to preserve same-sex marriage in the state. It won the 2010 Simon Carrington Chamber Singers Composition Competition. Acting Dunphy is also a stage actress. She has played a number of Shakespearean roles for theatre festivals and companies in Pennsylvania, where she has resided since 2003. The Philadelphia Inquirer called her \\"unquestionably the city's leading Shakespeare ingenue\\" for her performance as Ophelia in the Lantern Theater Company's Hamlet.

There have been 68 known tropical cyclones from the Eastern Pacific that affected the state, compared to only 13 such Atlantic hurricanes. The biggest threat from such storms in the state is their associated rainfall and flooding. The wettest storm was from the remnants of an Atlantic storm in 1941 that produced of precipitation. Since 1950, the highest rainfall total recorded was in Canton, also associated with an Atlantic storm in 1954. The rains in 1954 resulted in flooding in six towns that killed at least four people. Other deadly rainfall events from tropical cyclone remnants include Hurricane Dolly in 2008 and Tropical Storm Georgette in 2010. The former swept away a person along the Rio Ruidoso and caused $25 million in damage (2008 USD), which was the most damaging storm event. The floods damaged 500 buildings and destroyed 13 bridges. The latter caused heavy rains that resulted in one death in the Rio Grande. Climatology alt=A map of a state's terrain, with brown and white colors representing higher elevations, and yellow and green colors representing lower elevations. County borders are also shown on the map. Due to New Mexico's position in the southwestern United States, there are three primary causes for flooding within the state in the autumn months: the effects of tropical cyclones, the North American Monsoon, or an approaching cold front. Tropical cyclones from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans can affect New Mexico, usually in southern regions. Storms that originate from the Atlantic Ocean usually move through the Gulf of Mexico on a northwest trajectory, typically during the month of September. Tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific usually maintain a fast north-northeast track, occasionally through the Gulf of California, and generally affect the state from the middle of September to the middle of October. The accompanying moisture of the Pacific storms encounter the mountains of the state, and through orographic lift, produce heavy rainfall. Due to the storms' fast movement, the rainfall events accompanying Pacific storms are generally shorter lasting and more concentrated than other such storms in the state. In an average year, the remnants of 3.1 Pacific tropical cyclones affect the southwestern United States. In some locations, the systems provide 30% of the annual rainfall. In New Mexico, however, stations' annual rainfall from tropical cyclones range from 10% in the western portion to less than 5% in the eastern. Rainfall from tropical cyclones affect the Albuquerque International Sunport an average of 3.9 days per year. Storms affect New Mexico less than Arizona, and are generally weaker. The greatest threat from such storms are accompanying floods. Damage from tropical cyclones is expected to increase as the population increases in the southwestern United States. List of storms Before 1950 *October 4, 1911 ‚Äì Influenced by an approaching extratropical cyclone, the remnants of a tropical cyclone crossed the Gulf of California and Arizona into New Mexico, producing of rain in some areas. *September 18, 1918 ‚Äì The remnants of a Pacific hurricane moved through the northern portion of the state. *September 16, 1919 ‚Äì After striking Texas as a hurricane, a tropical depression dissipated over western Texas. Its remnants produced of rainfall in Roswell. *October 1, 1921 ‚Äì The remnants of a Pacific hurricane moved through the northern portion of the state. *August 27, 1932 ‚Äì A landfalling storm near Culiac√°n, Sinaloa produced heavy rainfall in the southwestern New Mexico for three days. *September 8, 1936 ‚Äì After moving through the Sea of Cortez into Arizona, the remnants of a tropical cyclone dropped in Datil. *September 2, 1938 ‚Äì The remnants of a Pacific storm produced rainfall in the state. *September 18, 1941 ‚Äì The remnants of an Atlantic storm dropped of rainfall in a 24‚Äëhour period. *August 31, 1942 ‚Äì A hurricane struck Texas and dissipated over southern New Mexico, producing of rain in 28 hours. The rainfall caused flooding in the Pecos and Canadian rivers. In one station along the Pecos River, the floods produced a discharge of 48,600 cubic feet per second (0.028 cubic meters per second), which was a 1 in 100 year event. 1950s Rainfall summary for a tropical depression in 1954 *1951 ‚Äì The remnants of a Pacific tropical cyclone affected the state. *October 7, 1954 ‚Äì Rains subsided from a tropical depression that crossed from Texas into New Mexico. The highest precipitation was in Canton, which was the greatest rainfall total associated with a tropical cyclone in the state since 1950. The rainfall caused flooding in Roswell and along the Pecos River system. The flooding caused millions in damage after flooding affected six towns and highways across the region. There were four confirmed fatalities with seven missing in the days after the storm. *1954 ‚Äì In addition to the previous storm, the remnants of a Pacific tropical cyclone affected the state. *October 6, 1957 ‚Äì After crossing northwestern Mexico, a tropical depression dissipated in the southern portion of the state. *1957 ‚Äì In addition to the previous storm, the remnants of another Pacific system affected the state. *September 12, 1958 ‚Äì A tropical storm dissipated over Baja California, spreading rainfall into the state. *October 6, 1958 ‚Äì A tropical depression from the Pacific dissipated over the state, after crossing Sonora and Arizona.

Laos: Politics, Economics and Society. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc. Thus, it may have gone through many reconstructions during the 19th or 20th century to attain the appearance it has today. Though this temple is created in Vientiane, it has the basic shape for what is known as the ‚ÄòLuang Prabang I style‚Äô with its scarce use of brickwork and rectangular-like body. Wat Ong Teu is said to have been placed along a cardinal point in accordance with three other temples but that may just be coincidental. History After commanding for the relocation of the capital of Laos from the city of Luang Prabang to Vientiane, King Setthathirath I produced many monasteries such as Pha That Luang and Haw Phra Kaew. The reason this wat (Lao for temple) was built was because Setthathirat I desired to create the Phra Ong Teu image that would be placed in it and to have it as his living quarters.Mansfield, S., & Koh, M. (1998). Cultures of the World: Laos. Tarrytown: Marshall Cavendish Benchmark. There would be six other sculptures of this image in other monasteries, but Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan contains the first. Since this period is known as the golden age, the wat would evolve into a complex with a sim (ordination hall), a ho rackhang (bell tower), a ho kong (drum tower), a that (stupa), and a kuti (monks‚Äô living quarters). Each of these parts of the complex all share the artistic motif of the architecture of the central wat, which is discussed later. The original use of this wat was for ceremonies of allegiance to the king. However, in the 17th century, Souligna Vongsa as king transformed the temple into a Buddhist learning center to ‚Äòteach, enlighten and inspire worshippers.‚Äô It became a school for monks coming from around Southeast Asia to study the dhamma.Ringis, R. (1990). Thai Temples and Temple Murals. New York: Oxford University Press. This becomes apparent because surrounding countries of Laos sent their monks to Vientiane to study this religion. Such a function is more understandable of Wat Ong Teu since there are many details that give the suggestion of a learning center.  Reconstruction  When Siam sacked Laos in 1827-28, as a punishment, almost all of the monasteries in Laos, including Wat Ong Teu, were destroyed. This was only made worse afterwards when the Ho bandits tried sack Vientiane again to take gold from Wat Ong Teu and others. In 1900, following the establishment of the Franco- Siamese treaty in 1843, the French chose Vientiane as their capital and started the reconstruction of its monasteries including Wat Ong Teu. As an addition, the French may have created a school, in the same format and appearance as the rest of the complex to further exemplify the function of Wat Ong Teu as a place of study. The Lao Buddhist Institute was made in 1929 and still functions today as a school for the Theravada Buddhist religion.  Architecture  In retrospect, the influence on the style of the original temple can be traced predominantly to India, though not directly. Indochina was part of the sphere of influence of India, known by George Coed√®s as the ‚ÄòIndianization of Southeast Asia.‚Äô The religion and customs of Indian civilization came ‚Äòthoroughly yet peacefully‚Äô to the people of this region, especially due to marriages between Indian men and local women.Bussagli, M. (1973). Oriental Architecture. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.Fisher, R. E. (1993). Buddhist Art and Architecture. New York: Thames and Hudson Inc. Laos, however, was a not a country during this time. The kingdom of Lan Xang (‚ÄòLand of a million elephants‚Äô) wasn‚Äôt established until the mid-13th century of the common era just years after all direct contact with India was completely diminished. Instead, the original Wat Ong Teu took its traits from other mixed ideas of architecture from surrounding countries that were established earlier than the 13th century. In essence, the variant notions of these Southeastern Asian countries on the Theravada Buddhist architecture of India, such as Cambodia and Siam (present day Thailand), influenced the ideas of how Wat Ong Teu would be depicted. Even though Laos borrowed traditions from these other cultures, the 16th century turned a new leaf for the Lao people in the form of a golden age. Thus, Wat Ong Teu has most of its own Lao Buddhist features and only minor details of surrounding influences. After the temple‚Äôs destruction, some of the techniques used to create it were lost but much of it wasn‚Äôt forgotten. Instead, modern techniques were blended in with the old during the temple‚Äôs reconstruction, especially in what was used to fortify the walls and roof. The result became a rich new style that is exclusive to Lao architecture. This primarily is because the modern reconstruction completed by the French kept sincere adherence to these Lao notions already established on temple aesthetics, with some artistic liberties since Laos at this time was a protectorate of France.  Exterior of the ordination hall  Entry gate One of the entry gates A multi-tiered archway serves as the entrance into the complex. It is miniature compared to that of Pha That Luang. The functionality of this seemingly simple archway is similar to that of the torana, or gateway, of Indian culture. The torana served as the passageway from secular ground to sacred ground. The difference is that this archway does not have any images for which a person can meditate and it doesn‚Äôt involve circumambulating a stupa.Lee, S. E. (1994). A History of Far Eastern Art. Upper Saddle River: Prentice-Hall, Inc. This characteristic may be present in all the temples and stupas that in Laos, especially at King Setthathirat‚Äôs more famous architectural creation, Pha That Luang. Main entrance Entrance to Wat Ong Teu The entrance to Wat Ong Teu is known to have many eccentricities that are indigenous only to Laos and no other Buddhist temple in Asia. Just before going up the stairs at the front of the temple, one can find the frieze that is exceedingly baroque, highlighting this Lao style. The green backdrop shimmers as many carved and gilded vine leaves curve in no apparent order or pattern. This motif is repeated throughout the whole front part of the temple, even surrounding the six small Buddhas that are just below the frieze. This foliage may be an allusion to the lotus flower which is an aniconic symbol of the Buddha. Another Lao characteristic of monasteries is the pointed double archway that flanks the six Buddhas. There are many variations of this characteristic, but the archway of Wat Ong Teu is the most simplistic aesthetically. One of the most native features to Laos is the Naga, or mythical water serpent, that serves as the guardian of the entrance. The Naga was widely known in Southeast Asia before Buddhism arrived. They would symbolize the Hindu god Shiva in which they represented destruction and renewal. How they relate to the Buddha lies in the story of Siddhartha under the Bodhi tree. This could be the second area one would pass from less secular ground to completely sacred ground. Though Nagas are usually seen with multiple heads. Wat Ong Teu‚Äôs version of the Naga has a single head with a its bright green body stretched out. There are three sets of Nagas that all give access to the same patio-type area in front the temple. This aspect is interesting because there is only one door that gives an entrance into the temple. It may be a reference to the original function of this wat as the king‚Äôs temple, with the front stairs only being walked on by the king while the others were reserved for normal patrons. The posts perpendicular to these Naga resemble the sort of pagoda or tower one would see in Laos. An image in one of the windows The doors and windows are made of wood and are decorated with many leaves and stems that spiral sporadically. These images are all carved, painted red and gilded to make the door and windows look as if they were made of metal. Each of the windows and the door have different images of the Buddha either directly or by aniconic representation. Some of them may evidently portray a Jataka, or story given of one of the Buddha‚Äôs past incarnations. Roof The roof of Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan. The three Phra Ong Teu Buddhas. Details of the golden pedestal. Seemingly the most intricate part of the exterior of Wat Ong Teu is its roof. It illustrates myriad styles from around Asia that blend in an extraordinarily harmonious way. A commonly used feature in Asia is for a curved roof. This non-linear approach was originated by the Chinese. In China, architects thought that evil spirits despised curved lines, therefore giving an apotropaic effect to the temple. Lao ideas of the curved roof should have been similar to China‚Äôs as well. This aspect is especially important when the principal function of this temple is to teach the Buddhist religion. Students learning the Buddhism should especially be protected from the evils of the outside world. An interesting feature is the multiple roofs that descend past the boundaries of the wall at a slope. This aspect is exclusive to Laos. Specifically, there are three or four superimposed roofs, with the two bottom roofs being supported by columns from within the temple. The reason for this intricate design is unknown, but it may be another aspect of protection because multiple roofs could cause confusion among evil spirits. The stone spire decoration with stacked, superimposed, decreasingly sized disks in the center of the keel is definitively a Buddhist element. It is known that before the Buddha went through enlightenment, he was always covered by parasols to indicate his status as a prince. Therefore, it is not unusual to see a parasol-like spire atop this temple. The other flame- like decorations, called chaw faa (sky clusters), lining the edges and vertices of the roof are frequently used in Laos. This may be another quality that emphasizes the apotropaic effect of the roof.  Interior of the ordination hall  The exterior may have much detail that is used for protection and attraction, but the interior does not mirror the same intricacy. In the temple, the floors are glossed and the walls and ceiling are painted with the same colors as the exterior. There is a red mat that is lined perfectly from the middle to the back of the sim where the Phra Ong Teu image resides. The most intricate objects in the temple are the columns that hold up the roof. They may have been made to look like oversize lotus flowers that have grown from the ground to support the roof of the temple. This may illustrate the natural world for which the Buddha would have liked to teach his followers.  Modern techniques  Once Laos became a French protectorate and reconstruction began, there may have been many liberties made to some of the minute details of the temple, but most of the essential attributes of the temple remain similar to the original construction. A very important change is in the stone and well-kept wood that fortifies the structure of the temple. The brackets are included in this use of preserved timber. There brackets on the outside and the inside. However, the columns are the objects that provide the most support for the three- or four-tiered roofs, so they are treated with more care than the brackets. Therefore, in essence, the modern approach is more of a post-and-lintel technique rather than the use of brackets. The lack of non-perishable material before French rule over Laos is indicative of their weak government. Some details (that are usually seen in developed countries in Europe and North America) include small, hanging chandeliers as well as fans placed on each column that lines the sim. These simple touches seem to emit a waning of sacredness for which the temple was originally created, but it may not be complete departure from belief. Most of the modern techniques may have been meant for the surrounding complex rather than the monastery itself. The central theme of all these buildings and towers remain faithful to that of Wat Ong Teu.  Art  ‚ÄòHeavy Buddha‚Äô accompanied by two standing Buddhas These original sculptures reside in the sim of the temple toward the furthest wall from the entrance. The Phra Ong Teu is made of a mix of metals, predominately bronze, and is seated atop a golden pedestal that was cast separately. The head may have been cast separately from the body and put together by the ‚Äòtonged and grooved joint techniques‚Äô showing the skill of Lao craftsmanship. The two standing Buddhas are connected to their respective platforms. These sculptures are raised on top of a platform with a color scheme similar to the rest of the temple. More recently, these sculptures are draped in linen or silk cloth, depicting the saffron clothing monks usually wear in Laos, with neon-colored halos placed on the wall behind them. This may add an artistic effect to the Buddhas so that a more prestigious role can be emphasized. However, Lao artists of this time never thought of these or other Buddha images as art, only as a means to ‚Äòeducate and enlighten.‚Äô Therefore, later use of this temple as a place for further learning of the Hinayana Buddhism would be the exact purpose the artists intended. It is usual to see the Enlightened One alone or accompanied by bodhisattvas in a triad, but here all three of these sculptures depict the Phra Ong Teu Buddha. A strong indication that these sculptures are Buddhas is the parasols that are suspended over them. The smaller Buddhas each have a parasol above them that is attached to a post protruding from behind them. The main Buddha has a distinctively rectangular parasol that is fastened to the ceiling. These parasols act in the same way as the parasol on the keel of the wat, but the parasols that hang over the Buddhas are more decorative. The rectangular parasol hanging over the Phra Ong Teu is more of a Japanese trait than anything Laos. The only record of any Japanese interaction with Laos would be during a five-year period in WWII.Askew, M., Logan, W. S., & Long, C. (2007). Vientiane: Lao urbanism, memory and identity. New York: Routledge. The only action caused by them was the nationalistic passion that the Lao people had in opposition to them. Not enough time was put into having any influence on their art of this Buddha or the temple that it is in. There are many other features of Phra Ong Teu Buddha that are common in relation to the codified Buddha, but it still has its Lao differences. The earliest image of the Buddha in Laos was influenced by the ‚ÄòPha Bang Khmer style‚Äô but started to become more distinctive in the 16th century along with the golden age. For example, the tightly curled hair that is displayed on the main Buddha is strongly reminiscent of the Gandhara style of India during the Gupta period, which is mirrored by the Pha Bang. However, the pointed swelling coming out of the top of the image‚Äôs head, signifying ‚Äòtranscendent knowledge,‚Äô expresses an exclusively Lao idea. This type of swell may be a facet solely of the Phra Ong Teu image that King Setthathirat created. Some other modified aspects of the image are the sharp ear rims with long lobes, the equal, extended length of the fingers and toes, and the sharp wide nose. There are a few mudras, or hand gestures, that these Buddhas portray. These gestures illustrate the Indian influence. Both of the smaller standing Buddhas have their hands up with palms facing outward, meaning fearlessness. The Phra Ong Teu Buddha instead adopts two mudras that allude to the moments just before Siddhartha‚Äôs Enlightenment. Specifically, the left hand is placed in the lap with the palm facing up toward the face which represents the idea of meditation. The greater gesture that captures the Enlightenment comes from his right hand. His hand is rested over his knee with fingers extended toward the earth. This symbolizes the calling of the Earth to protect the Buddha from Mara, India‚Äôs interpretation of the devil. This can then be connected to the Naga that was conjured up to help Siddhartha in his path for Enlightenment. In creating this image, King Setthathirat I proved his adherence to the Theravada Buddhism that has always been present in Laos since Lan Xang.  Conclusion  Of the many temples in Vientiane, Laos today, Wat Ong Teu Mahawihan is one of the more undervalued ones. Every detail that makes up the composition of this monastery has some sort of allusion to the teachings or image of the Buddha. From the Nagas guarding the entrance to the fastidiously heavy Buddha at the back of the sim in the temple, from the carved windows and doors to the lotus columns supporting the roof, Wat Ong Teu is a complete illustration of the story of Siddhartha meditating under the Bodhi tree. No area of the temple is left untouched which results in a sense of sacred ground. Though it may not be an international symbol, Wat Ong Teu is more widely known as an educational institute that provides widespread teaching of the Theravada Buddhism that originated in India. That belief hasn‚Äôt meandered to this day. As a center for learning, Wat Ong Teu continues to house the teachings of the beginning of Buddhism straight from the Buddha, though the two parties live centuries apart.

Sacramento Valley history is promoted through displays of historical photographs, artifacts, textiles and quilts, manuscripts and documents, and vintage newspapers from the Sacramento Valley region in the northern California Central Valley.Sacramento Valley Museum: \\"Homepage\\" . accessed 4.28.2014  History of the Museum  The building that houses the Sacramento Valley Museum was built in 1911 to serve as Williams Union High School. The school graduated classes until 1956, when a new high school was built. Some alumni include jazz musician Turk Murphy, of San Francisco‚Äôs Earthquake McGoon; Kenneth Zumwalt, editor of the Stars and Stripes during WWII; and the Fouch family of pharmacists, who served the Williams community for over 100 years. The old building sat dormant for six years until Sacramento Valley residents took up its cause. On August 15, 1962, architect Alvin Fingado visited the Williams High School building to ascertain its condition and determine what work would be needed to put the building in good condition. Fingado concluded that, among other things, the roof and skylight needed replacement and repair and the electrical wiring, the heating plant, and the plumbing system were in need of attention.Alvin Fingado, ‚ÄúExamination of Physical Premises of Williams High School ‚Äì 1911,‚Äù 7 November 1962 He estimated that in total the work would cost between $20,000 and $25,000 to put the building in good condition; however, it would cost considerably less with volunteer labor and donations. On February 1964, Lulu Salter, president of the Sacramento Valley Museum Association, stated, ‚ÄúOur building has tremendous possibilities . . . all we need is manpower and money.‚ÄùAuthor Unknown, ‚ÄúMuseum Lists Progress Report; Plans Opening for Spring,‚Äù The Williams Farmer, 20 February 1964 The museum opened before repairs to the building were complete.

The group of citizens who made up the first board of the Sacramento Valley Museum Association, in an effort to encourage interest in the developing museum, opened for viewing in March 1963, less than a year after architect Alvin Fingado stated the long- term repairs necessary to make the building inhabitable. The Museum was open for six months and then closed for repairs that were more extensive. The Museum officially opened in June 1964. In addition to exhibits of historic material, there were art exhibits and a room dedicated to art classes for the community. General information The museum is open from March through October, Thursday - Saturday (10 a.m. - 4 p.m.). It is closed November through February. Admission is free except for group or appointment visits. The SVM is a non-profit organization that runs primarily on the monetary gifts made from families, individuals, and corporations.

C√©saire first published the essay in 1950 in Paris with √âditions R√©clame, a small publisher associated with the French Communist Party (PCF). Five years later, he then edited and republished it with the anticolonial publisher Pr√©sence africaine (Paris and Dakar). The 1955 edition is the one with the widest circulation today, and it serves as a foundational text of postcolonial literature that discusses what C√©saire described as the appalling affair of the European civilizing mission. Rather than elevating the non- Western world, the colonizers de-civilize the colonized.  Argument  C√©saire‚Äôs Discourse on Colonialism argues that colonialism was not and had never been a benevolent movement whose goal was to improve the lives of the colonized; instead, colonists' motives were entirely self-centered, economic exploitation. According to C√©saire, by establishing colonies and then exploiting them, the European colonial powers have created two main problems: the problem of the proletariat and the colonial problem.Frutkin, Susan. Black Between Worlds. Miami: University of Miami, 1973. p. 29. In describing the colonial problem that European civilization has created, he calls Europe \\"indefensible\\", whose colonizers cannot be misconstrued as positive. C√©saire discusses the relationship between civilization and savagery and points out the hypocrisy of colonialism. He asserts that it is ironic that colonizers hoped to rid the countries they colonized of ‚Äúsavages‚Äù but in reality, by killing, raping, and destroying the land in which those ‚Äúsavages‚Äù lived on, they were themselves. His interpretation flips the common narrative, in order to point out the autonomy that existed in colonizing foreign lands. He bases his argument on the claim that, \\"no one colonizes innocently, that no one colonizes with impunity either; that a nation which colonizes, that a civilization which justifies colonization‚Äîand therefore force‚Äîis already a sick civilization, a civilization which is morally diseased, which irresistibly, progressing from one consequence to another, one denial to another, calls for its Hitler, I mean its punishment\\".C√©saire, Aim√©. Discourse on Colonialism. New York: Monthly Review Press, 2000. p. 39. He labels the colonizers as barbaric for their treatment of those in the colonies. He defines the relationship as one limited to \\"forced labor, intimidation, pressure, the police, taxation, theft, rape, compulsory crops, contempt, mistrust, arrogance, self-complacency, swinishness, brainless elites, degraded masses\\".C√©saire, Aim√©. Discourse on Colonialism. New York: Monthly Review Press, 2000. p. 42. In addition, C√©saire also acknowledges the racial construction of the relationship. By identifying the colonial relationship as one based on race, he draws comparisons between his home of Martinique with the colonies in Africa. By equating racism, barbarism and colonialism, he claims colonization to be a form of dehumanization that results from Europe‚Äôs racism against black populations in Africa and the Caribbean. He writes that Hitler differed in the eyes of the Europeans because he \\"applied to Europe colonialist procedures which until then had been reserved exclusively for the Arabs of Algeria, the 'coolies' of India and the 'niggers' of Africa\\", meaning that, by persecuting white Europeans, Hitler produced violence most commonly reserved for non-white populations.C√©saire, Aim√©. Discourse on Colonialism. New York: Monthly Review Press, 2000. p. 36. Marxist theory C√©saire criticized the \\"humanist\\" interpretation of colonialism because it continued to deny the humanity of the colonized peoples‚Äîthe very antithesis of humanism, which emphasizes the value and agency of human beings. Additionally, he referred to Marxist theory and criticized the \\"bourgeois, capitalistic European culture and said that capitalism would always disintegrate into Nazism\\". The most notable allusion to Marxism appears towards the end of the text when he writes, \\"it is a new society that we must create, with the help of all our brother slaves, a society rich with all the productive power of modern times, warm with all the fraternity of olden days\\". For some examples showing that this is possible, we can look to the Soviet Union\\".C√©saire, Aim√©. Discourse on Colonialism. New York: Monthly Review Press, 2000. 52. Reception Due to its \\"harsh tone and radical statements\\", the essay has been compared to \\"a declaration of war\\" on colonialism.Kelley, Robin D.G. \\"A Poetic of Anticolonialism \\", Monthly Review: An Independent Socialist Magazine 51.6 (1999) Discourse added to the themes developed in his 1939 poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (\\"Notebook of a Return to the Native Land\\"), which he wrote in response to leaving France and returning to Martinique. In Cahier, C√©saire notes the relationship between Martinique and his African heritage, confirming this bond between colonies in Africa and colonies elsewhere as one based on race. In identifying the racism problem associated with the colonial relationship, he claims that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party's persecution of Jews during World War II and the Holocaust was not an aberration, but rather the norm in Europe. Style C√©saire wrote his book in a poetic style, discussing the negative effects of colonization on colonies. He writes in poetic prose as, \\"a method of achieving clairvoyance, of obtaining the knowledge we need to move forward\\". His unique style of writing sets him apart from other postcolonial academics who published works alongside him at the same time.

Spanish explorers recorded reaching the area in the later 16th century, and European Americans of the United States founded the city named Rome in 1834, when the residents of the area were still primarily Cherokee, before their removal on the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory. The competition for resources among its diverse inhabitants led to both innovation and strife. Its location at the confluence of three rivers enabled Rome to develop as a crossroads for trade and transportation. The city was later designated as the county seat of Floyd County, Georgia. Today, Rome is the largest city in Northwest Georgia, and is a regional center of healthcare, education, and manufacturing.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Article on Rome, Georgia Native American era Preceded by numerous other cultures, the people of the Mississippian culture inhabited the area from about 1000 CE. These people are believed to have suffered high mortality rates and mostly died off in the late 16th century due to exposure to new infectious diseases carried by the Spanish expeditions. Specific information about events in the area of Rome before the Spanish expeditions in the 16th century is unknown, due to the native inhabitants' lack of written records; archeological excavations and linguistics have provided insight to the cultures. Native American territories in the Southeastern area of North America in 1715. State outlines are from later times. Historians debate whether Hernando de Soto was the first Spanish explorer to encounter Native Americans in the area now known as Rome, but they widely agree that he passed through the region with his expedition in 1540.Article on De Soto's trail through North Georgia, FloridaHistory.com. In 1560, Trist√°n de Luna sent a detachment of 140 soldiers and two Dominican friars north along de Soto's route. This group established relations with the Coosa chiefdom and assisted the Coosa in a raid against the rebellious province of Napoch√≠n, in what is now known as Tennessee.Article on Tristan de Luna's trail through North Georgia, Our Georgia History Exposed to unfamiliar European diseases, within 20 years these mound builders were gone, replaced by the Creek.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Article on De Soto and De Luna's explorations in Georgia.Georgia colony, 1732‚Äì1777, and the Proclamation Line of 1763 The Abihka tribe of Creek in the area of Rome later became part of the Upper Creek, and merged with other tribes to become the Ulibahalis. They later migrated westward into Alabama, settling in the general region of Gadsden,Waselkov, Gregory A. and Marvin T. Smith \\"Upper Creek Archaeology\\" in McEwan, Bonnie G., ed. Indians of the Greater Southeast: Historical Archaeology and Ethnohistory (Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 2000) p. 244-245Ethridge, Robbie Franklyn Creek Country: The Creek Indians and Their World (Chapel Hill, North Carolina: UNC Press) p. 27 By the mid-18th century, the Cherokee people had moved into the area, pushed by European-American encroachment. In the 18th century, a high demand in Europe for American deer skins had led to a brisk trade between Creek and later Cherokee hunters and white traders. A Cherokee village named Chatuga was established near the confluence of the Coosa River after their migration westward during the Cherokee‚ÄìAmerican wars (1776-1794). The Cherokee referred to this area as \\"Head of Coosa.\\" Several Cherokee leaders settled here, developing plantations, including chiefs Major Ridge and John Ross. In the mid-20th century, the Junior League bought Ridge's house for preservation and in 1971 adapted it as a museum known as the Chieftains House. It is now officially the Chieftains Museum (Major Ridge Home) and has been designated by the Department of Interior as a National Historic Landmark. The Head of Coosa Cherokee allowed a few white traders and some settlers (primarily from the British Colonies of Georgia and Carolina) to trade here. They were later joined by missionaries and more settlers. After the American War of Independence, most new settlers came from the area of the U.S. state of Georgia east of the Proclamation Line of 1763, by which Britain had tried to preserve the territory west of the Appalachian Mountains for Native Americans. 1802 map of Georgia-Yazoo lands. The triangular section labeled \\"Assigned to Georgia 1802\\" was Cherokee land claimed as part of the Compact of 1802 between Georgia and the United States Encroachment soon began on these Cherokee lands by European Americans. The United States and Georgia executed the Compact of 1802, in which Georgia sold its claimed Western lands to the United States. (In colonial times, it claimed territory extending west from its coastal colony.) In exchange the United States agreed to ignore Cherokee land titles and remove all Cherokee from Georgia. The commitment to evict the Cherokee was not immediately enforced. Through the 1820s and 1830s, chiefs Major Ridge and John Ross led efforts to stop their removal, including several Federal lawsuits. During the 1813 Creek Civil War, most Cherokee took the side of the Upper Creek Indians against the more traditional the Red Stick Creek Indians. Before they moved to Head of Coosa, Chief Ridge commanded a company of Cherokee warriors as a unit of the Tennessee militia, with Chief Ross as adjutant. This unit was under the overall command of Major Andrew Jackson, and supported the Upper Creek. In 1829, gold was discovered near Dahlonega, Georgia, starting the first gold rush in the United States. The Indian Removal Act of 1830, which fulfilled the Compact of 1802, was prompted by the gold discovery as well as President Andrew Jackson's already stated strong support for removal. In 1831 Georgia's General Assembly quickly passed legislation claiming all Cherokee land in Northwest Georgia, prior to their vacating it. This entire territory was called Cherokee County until additional legislation in 1832 divided the territory into the nine counties that exist today.Historical Atlas of Georgia Counties : Cherokee Territory/CountyAct Dividing Original Cherokee County City founding period In 1834, the city of Rome was founded by Col. Daniel R. Mitchell, Col. Zachariah Branscome Hargrove, Maj. Philip Hemphill, Col. William Smith, and Mr. John Lumpkin (nephew of Governor Lumpkin), who determined the name for the new city by holding a drawing. Each put his choice in a hat, with Col. Mitchell submitting the name of Rome in reference to the area's hills and rivers. Mitchell's submission was selected, and the Georgia Legislature made Rome an official city in 1835. The county seat was subsequently moved east from the village of Livingston to Rome. Civil War period Rome in 1864, during the occupation by Union forces Vandever and his officers in Rome (1864, on East 4th Ave) In April 1863, during the U.S. Civil War, the city was defended by Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest against Union Colonel Abel Streight's \\"lightning mule\\" raid from the area east of modern-day Cedar Bluff, Alabama.About North Georgia: Article about the raid of the Lightning Mule Brigade General Forrest tricked Colonel Streight into surrendering just a few miles shy of Rome. Realizing their vulnerability, Rome's city council allocated $3,000 to build three fortifications. Although these became operational by October 1863, efforts to strengthen the forts continued as the war progressed. These forts were named after Romans who had been killed in action: Fort Attaway was on the western bank of the Oostanaula River, Fort Norton was on the eastern bank of the Oostanaula, and Fort Stovall was on the southern bank of the Etowah River. At least one other fort was later built on the northern side of the Coosa River.RomeGeorgia.com : Article on the history of Rome's forts.Roadside Georgia: Article briefly discussing 3 forts built in Rome during the Civil War. In May 1864, Union General Jefferson C. Davis, under the command of Major General William Tecumseh Sherman, attacked and captured Rome when the outflanked Confederate defenders retreated under command of Major General Samuel Gibbs French.The Life of Ulysses S. Grant, by Charles A. Dana and J. H. Wilson, Gurdon Bill & Company, 1868, Page 275. Union General William Vandever was stationed in Rome, and is depicted with his staff in a picture taken there.Eicher & Eicher, Civil War High Commands, p. 542. Due to Rome's forts and iron works, which included the manufacture of cannons, Rome was an important military target. Davis's forces occupied Rome for several months, making repairs to the damaged forts and briefly quartering General Sherman. On November 11, 1864, foreshadowing Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 120, Union forces destroyed Rome's forts, iron works, the rail line to Kingston, and any other material that could be useful to the South's war effort as they withdrew from Rome to participate in the Atlanta Campaign.The clock tower Reconstruction period In 1871, Rome constructed a water tank on Neely Hill, which overlooks the downtown district. This later became a clock tower, and has served as the town's iconic landmark ever since, appearing in the city's crest and local business logos. As a result, Neely Hill is also referred to as Clock Tower Hill. With two rivers merging to form a third, Rome has occasionally been subjected to serious flooding. The first severe flood after Rome became a city was the flood of 1886, which inundated the city and allowed a steamboat to travel down Broad Street.Roadside Georgia: Article mentioning the flood of 1886. In 1891, upon recommendation of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Georgia State Legislature amended Rome's charter to create a commission to oversee the construction of river levees to protect the town against future floods.Acts Passed by the General Assembly of Georgia, Volume II. Atlanta Georgia, Geo. W. Harrison, State Printer (Franklin Publishing House) 1892: Creating Levee Commission for Rome, Etc. No. 625 (pages 585‚Äì590). In the late 1890s, additional flood control measures were instituted, including raising the height of Broad Street by about 15 feet. As a result, many of the current basements of Rome's historic buildings were originally ground level entrances.RomeGeorgia.com: Article mentioning the raising of Broad Street.

Sustainability Work Mendon√ßa's sustainability career is most associated with his work on feed-in tariffs, a renewable energy policy. He did advocacy and education work on this topic on four continents, contributing to legislative changes in several countries. Much of this work was carried out while he served as a Research Manager for the World Future Council, which is an international NGO. In addition, he subsequently worked with The Converging World, a renewable energy-focused charity based in Bristol, England. For a short period of time, Mendon√ßa also worked as a freelance sustainability researcher and writer in which he produced two key studies. The first reviewed the first year performance and outcomes of the UK feed-in tariff in 2011, and the second assessed The Green Economy in Bristol and the West of England, which was published in January 2012. The latter examined the size and make-up of the environmental technologies sector in the region at that time. His works also surveyed the UK green policy environment, and summarized some of the other key aspects of a green economy, including sustainable design of goods and services, retail, food, and well-being. The report concluded with a call for 'Resilience Planning', an ongoing process of strategic collaboration between actors and stakeholders in the region, with the main purpose of meeting local needs sustainably through investment in local assets. The integration and optimization of food, energy and transport systems were central focuses, and he argued that the development of resilience should merge the agendas of sustainability, economic development, social capital development, participatory democracy and emergency planning.Uniteddiversity.coop, direct download Miguel wrote and co-wrote several books, and numerous articles, book chapters and papers on sustainability and renewable energy policy.

Names Lakkia people are also known as the Ch√°shƒÅn Y√°o Ëå∂Â±±Áë∂, meaning \\"Tea Mountain Yao\\", since they were traditionally considered by neighboring peoples to be ethnic Yao people. The name Lakkia is an autonym (self-designated name) that means \\"mountain people\\". All Lakkia dialects have 5 tones. Classification There is currently no consensus on the classification of Lakkia within the Kra‚ÄìDai family. Solnit (1988) and Hansell (1988) classify Lakkia as a sister of the Kam‚ÄìSui branch. Additionally, Solnit (1988) classifies Biao and Lakkia together as part of a Biao-Lakkia branch that is coordinate to Kam-Sui. However, L.-Thongkum (1992) considers Lakkia to be most closely related to the Tai branch, based on the large number of shared lexical items. Dialects Dialects of Lakkia include (L.-Thongkum 1992): *Jintian ÈáëÁî∞ *Liula ÂÖ≠Êãâ *Jinxiu ÈáëÁßÄ *Lingzu Â≤≠Á•ñ *Changdong ÈïøÂ≥í The Lingzu dialect still preserves /kl-/ initial clusters, which corresponds to /kj-/ in most other dialects (L.-Thongkum 1992). Additionally, Changdong ÈïøÊ¥û and Jintian ÈáëÁî∞ tone (51) corresponds to Jinxiu ÈáëÁßÄ tone (231). Also, L.-Thongkum (1992) reports that Jintian ÈáëÁî∞ is a less conservative dialect.

How had one brother, James Eads How. Not only was their grandfather a wealthy engineer and contractor, but their father, James Flintham How, was a vice-president and the General Manager of the Wabash Railroad. Thus they were the heirs of one of St. Louis's most wealthy families. While his brother chose to live as a hobo and spent his efforts trying to help the homeless, Louis How \\"became an artist and took to the gay bohemian life\\". While How certainly wrote from a position of knowledge and authority when he created the biography of his grandfather, the biography was criticized in a review from MIT. Before his poetry was first published, How had compiled a manuscript anthology of American poetry, but never published it. His manuscript was responsible for a revival of interest in early American poet Frederick Goddard Tuckerman.

In the Napoleonic Wars, he made a mark in two major campaigns. In 1809, he was briefly Proprietor (Inhaber) of an infantry regiment and rose to command a division. His son Konstantin d'Aspr√© (1789‚Äì1850) also became an Austrian general. D'Aspr√© helped put down the Brabant Revolution of 1789 and 1790 in his native land, and won a coveted award. During the War of the First Coalition he was promoted to command a regiment. He played an important role in one clash during the 1805 campaign. In 1809, he led a brigade of grenadiers in the early battles and later was appointed to command a grenadier division. He was mortally wounded while leading his soldiers at the Battle of Wagram. Early career Born at Ghent in the Austrian Netherlands on 27 December 1754, d'Aspr√© made his career in the army.Smith, Digby & Kudrna, Leopold (compiler). napoleon-series.org Austrian Generals 1792-1815: Konstantin D'Aspr√© von Hoobreuk A son, also named Konstantin, was born on 18 December 1789 in Brussels.Wurzbach, Constantin von. \\"D'Aspre Constantin II Freiherr\\".

He fought during the War of the First Coalition, becoming Oberst in 1794. At the Battle of Verona on 26 April 1799, the d'Aspr√© J√§ger Corps of 10 companies was assigned to the brigade of Anton von Elsnitz in Konrad Valentin von Kaim's division.Smith, Digby. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998. . 149 The J√§ger Corps also fought at the Battle of Magnano on 6 April.Smith, 151 D'Aspr√© was promoted General-major on 6 February 1800. He served under Peter Karl Ott von B√°tork√©z in the operations leading up to the Siege of Genoa.Smith, 179 Like other √©migr√© officers, D'Aspr√© had an aggressive outlook. In one action, his fellow general Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim chided him for being so impatient. Gottesheim asked what good could be done by cavalry across the rough ground between them and the French and d'Aspr√© replied, \\"Beat them\\".Arnold, James R. Marengo & Hohenlinden. Barnsley, South Yorkshire, UK: Pen & Sword, 2005. On 7 April 1800, Nicolas Soult and 5,000 French soldiers launched a surprise attack on Monte Fascio. The French assault mauled Ott's division, forcing the 2nd Battalion of the Archduke Joseph Infantry Regiment Nr. 63 to surrender. For a loss of only 200 killed and wounded, Soult's men inflicted losses of 54 killed, 178 wounded, and 1,400 captured on the Austrians. D'Aspr√© was made a prisoner during the encounter. Napoleonic Wars 1805 D'Aspr√© received a command in the army of Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and Karl Mack von Lieberich at the beginning of the War of the Third Coalition. He led a brigade-sized unit of three and one- half infantry battalions and six cavalry squadrons.Ebert, Jens-Florian. napoleon-online.de √ñsterreichische Generalit√§t 1792-1815, Aspre When the army of Emperor Napoleon I of France reached the Danube on 6 October, Mack realized that his army was in danger of being cut off from Vienna. At that time, he made the questionable decision to assemble the corps of Franz Jellacic, Franz von Werneck, and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg near Ulm, renouncing any idea of retreating south to the Tyrol.Kagan, 392 On 8 October, he issued orders for his army to concentrate at G√ºnzburg downstream from Ulm. He hoped to put his troops in a position to sever Napoleon's supply line back to France. At this time, Napoleon was only vaguely aware of the Austrian army's position.Kagan, 400 Battle of Gunzburg, 9 October 1805, where d'Aspr√© was captured On 8 October, Marshals Joachim Murat and Jean Lannes encountered Franz Xavier Auffenberg's division at the Battle of Wertingen. The French crushed the outnumbered Austrians and drove the survivors west to G√ºnzburg.Kagan, 402-404 The next day, Mack and Ferdinand drew up their troops facing east on the south bank of the Danube near G√ºnzburg. Mack deployed d'Aspr√© and a light force that included Tyrolean J√§gers to hold and scout the north bank. Unknown to Mack, Marshal Michel Ney sent one of his divisions to seize the G√ºnzburg bridges from the north that morning.Kagan, 406-408 Jean- Pierre Firmin Malher formed his 3rd Division of the VI Corps into three columns and marched south on 9 October. The western column blundered into a marsh, while the eastern column was badly delayed. The centre column marched straight for G√ºnzburg and collided with d'Aspr√©'s troops. As soon as the soldiers in G√ºnzburg heard the firing, they immediately destroyed the bridges. Unfortunately, this left d'Aspr√© with the French in front of him and an unbridged river behind him. He surrendered with 200 J√§gers and two cannons. Warned by d'Aspr√©'s scouting force, the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment Nr. 3 and 20 cannons mounted a vigorous defence, bringing Mahler's attack to an abrupt halt at the river bank. At this point, Mack ordered Ignaz Gyulai to rebuild the bridge on the east side of town and cross to the north bank. Mack still dreamed of crossing the Danube and advancing on Giengen and N√∂rdlingen. No sooner did Gyulai have the bridge ready, when the tardy western column appeared and captured the span, winning the battle for the French.Kagan, 408-409 Mack later claimed that d'Aspr√© failed to report his contact with the French, though this may be an attempt at self-justification.Kagan, 409 Ney interrogated his prisoner d'Aspr√© and reported to Napoleon that the Austrian army was falling back to Biberach an der Ri√ü. This was not true, but it is not clear whether d'Aspr√© deliberately misled his captor or if he was only guessing what Mack's intentions were.Kagan, 212 The campaign ended in disaster for Austria when Mack capitulated with 25,000 troops at Ulm on 20 October, Werneck surrendered his remaining 6,000 men on 18 October, and the 4,600-strong garrison of Memmingen also ran up the white flag. A total of almost 50,000 Austrians became prisoners in the fighting.Kagan, 440 1809 Battle of Landshut, 21 April 1809. Painting by Louis Hersent. At the start of the War of the Fifth Coalition, d'Aspr√© led a brigade in Michael von Kienmayer's small II Reserve Armeekorps consisting of the Puteani, Brezeczinsky, Scovaud, Kirchenbetter, and Scharlach grenadier battalions, plus a battery of eight 6-pounder cannons.Bowden, Scotty & Tarbox, Charlie. Armies on the Danube 1809. Arlington, Texas: Empire Games Press, 1980. 72 In the Battle of Abensberg on 20 April 1809, Archduke Louis of Austria tried unsuccessfully to defend the line of the Abens River. During the morning, Louis called up Kienmayer's corps from Ludmannsdorf to support Joseph Radetzky von Radetz's left flank brigade near Siegenburg.Arnold, James R. Crisis on the Danube. New York: Paragon House, 1990. . 107-108 During the afternoon, d'Aspr√©'s grenadiers supported Radetzky as he fell back toward Pfeffenhausen.Arnold Crisis, 116 At 11:00 PM that night, Bavarian pursuers aggressively crossed the Gro√üe Laber stream and attacked. Radetzky borrowed one of d'Aspr√©'s grenadier battalions and held the Hornbach hill south of Pfeffenhausen until the early morning hours.Arnold Crisis, 137 Michael von Kienmayer On 21 April, Napoleon attacked Johann von Hiller in the Battle of Landshut but the Austrians managed to avoid being trapped.Epstein, 68 However, Hiller's left wing lost an estimated 9,000 casualties during the day. Three of d'Aspr√©'s grenadier battalions formed the Austrian rear guard as they retreated to Neumarkt-Sankt Veit.Petre, F. Loraine. Napoleon and the Archduke Charles. New York: Hippocrene Books, (1909) 1976. 153 D'Aspre was present at the Battle of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit on 24 April, when Hiller lashed out at his Bavarian and French pursuers.Petre, 218-219 Kienmayer's force retreated through Braunau am Inn on 26 April.Petre, 220 D'Aspr√© missed the hard-fought Battle of Ebelsberg on 3 May. Hiller unwisely sent Kienmayer's troops to Asten, even as the French were in the process of driving in his rear guards.Petre, 234 Nevertheless, d'Aspr√©'s promotion to Feldmarschall-Leutnant came through the next day. Prince Johann Liechtenstein On 8 May, most of Hiller's wing, including Kienmayer's corps, crossed to the north bank of the Danube at Mautern an der Donau.Petre, 251 Within a short time, d'Aspr√©'s grenadiers crossed to the south bank again to assist in Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este's short-lived defence of Vienna. Other defending forces were landwehr under Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough, a division led by Josef von Dedovich, and a brigade co-commanded by Armand von Nordmann and Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Fels√∂-Kubiny.Petre, 254 At 3:00 AM on 12 April, d'Aspr√© led his five battalions in an attack on the French positions at the Lusthaus on Prater Island. The attack was repulsed by the defenders, but its real purpose was to cover the Austrian retreat to the north bank of the Danube, which was successfully carried out.Petre, 256 In mid-May, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen merged the II Reserve Armeekorps into the I Reserve Armeekorps under the leadership of Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein.Petre, 264 In the new organization, d'Aspr√© and Johann Nepomuk von Prochaska became the two infantry division commanders. D'Aspr√©'s division comprised the five battalions from his former brigade plus the Bissingen, Oklopsin, and Maybl√ºmel grenadier battalions. The 5,362 elite infantry were divided into two 4-battalion brigades under Franz Mauroy de Merville and Anton von Hammer, and included a brigade battery of six 6-pounder cannons.Bowden & Tarbox, 91 Merville's grenadier brigade of d'Aspr√©'s division storms Essling. Painting by Felician Myrbach. On 21 May, the first day of the Battle of Aspern-Essling, the grenadier reserve was not committed to combat.Petre, 286 The next day, Napoleon tried to break out of the narrow bridgehead by sending Marshal Jean Lannes with three divisions to assault the weak Austrian centre. In the crisis, Archduke Charles moved d'Aspr√©'s and Prochaska's grenadier divisions (under Kienmayer) to block Lannes.Epstein, Robert M. Napoleon's Last Victory and the Emergence of Modern War. Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 1994. 113 When the troops showed unsteadiness, Charles personally waved the colours of the grenadiers of the Zach Infantry Regiment Nr. 15 to rally his troops. This greatly heartened the defenders, and the French assault was defeated when reinforcements arrived from the right and left flanks.Petre 290 In the afternoon, Charles ordered Merville's brigade from d'Aspr√©'s division to attack Essling, which had held out against repeated assaults. The grenadiers routed the French from the village, except for the fortress-like granary which held out. Later, five battalions of the Imperial Guard recaptured Essling.Bowden & Tarbox, 79 On 24 May, the emperor appointed d'Aspr√© Proprietor (Inhaber) of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 18. Unfortunately, the general was not destined to enjoy this honour for very long. D'Aspr√©'s division maintained the same organization for the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, except that the Maybl√ºmel battalion was renamed Locher. Also, two 6-pounder and one 3-pounder brigade batteries were attached, with a total strength of 24 cannons.Bowden & Tarbox, 166 On the night of the 4th, Napoleon launched a massive amphibious assault from Lobau Island to the north bank of the Danube, forcing back the Austrian VI Armeekorps and Advance Guard.Epstein, 150-151 At 6:00 PM that afternoon, Napoleon sent Nicolas Oudinot's II Corps, Eug√®ne de Beauharnais' Army of Italy, and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's IX Saxon Corps to break Archduke Charles' line near Wagram. After initially being driven back, the Austrian I and II Armeekorps counterattacked and routed the Franco-Allied forces.Epstein, 153-154 D'Aspr√© was mortally wounded at the Battle of Wagram. Painting by Carle Vernet. For the 6th, Archduke Charles planned to envelop both of Napoleon's flanks. At 4:00 AM, Prince Franz Seraph of Rosenberg-Orsini's IV Armeekorps and Nordmann's Advance Guard attacked the French right flank. Meanwhile, Johann von Klenau's VI Armeekorps and Johann Kollowrat's III Armeekorps marched against the French left. Charles intended for Liechtenstein's I Reserve, Heinrich, Count of Bellegarde's I Armeekorps, and Prince Friedrich Franz Xaver of Hohenzollern-Hechingen's II Armeekorps to support the attack of the right wing. Napoleon planned for Louis Davout's III Corps to crush Rosenberg's left flank and roll up the Austrian line.Epstein, 156 Rosenberg's early morning attack quickly failed against Davout's defences. Believing his position in the centre badly exposed, Bernadotte defied his orders and evacuated Aderklaa, a village located southwest of Wagram. After Bellegarde occupied the village, a furious Napoleon ordered its immediate recapture by Bernadotte's Saxons and Andr√© Mass√©na's IV Corps. The Saxons ran into an intense artillery barrage and ran away, but Claude Carra Saint-Cyr's division retook Aderklaa.Petre, 367 On the Austrian side, Charles was compelled to send in the two grenadier divisions to support Bellegarde's troops in the see-saw contest for Aderklaa.Epstein, 157 The Austrians managed to recapture Aderklaa, but Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's division soon counterattacked. After brutal fighting, Molitor was forced to leave the village in Austrian hands.Petre, 368-369 Early in the afternoon, Napoleon ordered Jacques MacDonald's 8,000 men to attack the Austrian centre. Forming his three weak divisions into a hollow square, MacDonald led his soldiers forward at the boundary between the Austrian Reserve and III Armeekorps. The French smashed into their adversaries' front, but the Austrian formations on the flanks held firm, preventing a breakthrough.Arnold, James R. Napoleon Conquers Austria. Westport, Conn.: Praeger Publishers, 1995. . 156-157 Seeing MacDonald's attack stall, Napoleon sent his reserves to help. In order to halt the French attack, one Austrian grenadier brigade had wheeled to face the northern side of the square. The reinforcements took the brigade in flank and drove it back in confusion to Aderklaa, where it attempted to hold out. D'Aspr√© tried to rally his men but suffered a fatal wound. After the fall of their leader, his men abandoned the position.Arnold Napoleon, 163 When the army retreated north after the battle, the stricken general was taken along and he died on 8 July at Mikulov (Nikolsburg) in what is now the Czech Republic. He was one of four Austrian generals killed or mortally wounded at Wagram. The others were Josef Philipp Vukassovich, Peter von V√©csey, and Nordmann.Petre, 379 Like his father, his son Konstantin went on to become an Austrian general, fighting at the Battle of Novara in 1849 and dying in 1850.

It depicts the struggle between a psychic named Cho-in (Gang Dong-won) who can control people with his mind and a man named Kyu-nam (Go Soo) who is immune to the psychic's supernatural power.  Plot  Little Cho-in's mother makes him wear a blindfold to suppress his mind control ability. As the two are abused by Cho-in's father, Cho-in compels the man to commit suicide. Cho-in's mother subsequently tries to murder her son, but Cho-in stops her and runs away. He grows up in contempt for the society, making liberal use of his power to steal money from businesses and live in a hotel room. Kyu-nam works at a scrapyard alongside an international crew, including his best friends Turk Ali and Ghanaian Bubba. He is hit by a car right before his birthday, but makes an unusually quick recovery. However, he loses his job at the scrapyard in the meanwhile. He finds employment at Utopia, a pawn shop owned by Jung-sik, who is concerned about a mysterious loss of money. Kyu-nam befriends Jung-sik's daughter, Yeong-sook, and is visited at his new workplace by Ali and Bubba. Cho-in arrives, paralyzing everyone present and manipulating Jung-sik into giving him money. To Cho-in's surprise, Kyu-nam resists his influence and attempts to stop him. Cho-in uses the others to overpower Kyu-nam; Kyu-nam is stabbed in the back and electrocuted, while Jung-sik gets his head trapped between iron bars at the counter and suffocates. Jung-sik and Kyu-nam are taken to a hospital, where doctors are unable to save Jung-sik, but Kyu-nam recovers almost immediately. Blaming Cho-in for Jung-sik's death, Kyu-nam resolves to bring the psychic to justice. With the help of Ali and Bubba, he breaks into Utopia's back room to recover the CCTV tape with Cho-in's appearance. The three are forced to flee from a mob of people controlled by Cho-in, and Kyu- nam is separated from the others. He manages to knock Cho-in out and take him to a police station, but the officers ignore his warnings and are mind- controlled. Kyu-nam chases Cho-in to a metro station, where Cho-in commands a mother to throw her infant child against a speeding train. Kyu-nam saves the child, but is struck by the train and left by Cho-in to die. However, he recovers from his wounds once more. Kyu-nam contacts Ali and Bubba, who agree to help him hunt down Cho-in. Ali modifies an old van and constructs a flare gun with the intent of countering Cho-in's ability. Both Kyu-nam and Cho-in come under investigation by the authorities, who send a team to search Cho- in's hotel room. Cho-in murders the investigators and leaves the apartment, taking with him only a toy figurine of a young man. He robs a bank and visits his mother, who is also being questioned by the authorities; again, Cho-in kills the officers, but is unable to take his mother's life, instead leaving her with a large sum of money. Kyu-nam confronts Cho-in in an apartment complex, where Cho-in mocks him and forces several people into suicide to torment Kyu-nam. Outside, Ali and Bubba attack Cho-in with the flare gun, but it proves ineffective and they are captured. Back at Utopia, Kyu-nam is ambushed by Cho-in, who then hangs him alongside Ali and Bubba. Kyu-nam escapes, but cannot save his friends in time. Cho-in takes Yeong-sook hostage and causes a large traffic accident to stop Kyu-nam; however, Kyu-nam survives as Ali's and Bubba's apparitions instruct him to activate a speed booster in his van, installed there by Ali. Kyu-nam corners Cho-in on a rooftop, where Kyu-nam is shot but manages to throw both of them onto the street below. Cho- in is killed by the fall while Kyu-nam, once again, lives; he notices Cho-in's toy figurine and reflects on whether in different circumstances, the two of them could have been friends. At a metro station, a quadriplegic Kyu-nam (who uses a wheelchair) meets up with Yeong-sook, who has fulfilled her dream of becoming a flight attendant. A woman attempts suicide by lying down on the train tracks; she is rescued in the nick of time by Kyu-nam, who seems to have made another miraculous recovery. Cast * Gang Dong-won as Cho-in: A robber who eschews humanity in itself after his parents attempted to kill him and wears a prosthetics leg on his right.

Mandarava, the daughter of King Arshadhara and Queen Mohauki,.Kunsang (1994), p. 264 is said to have been born a prodigy and an 'Awareness Dakini' (yes-shes mkha'-'gro) and was very beautiful. She refused all offers of marriage and fed her father the flesh of a Brahmin (a terrible offence), left the palace, and took on the robes of a beggar. She was ordained by the famous Buddhist scholar ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita, who is also said to have been a native of Zahor, and came to terms with her father who provided a palace for her meditation. When Padmasambhava came to Zahor from Orgyen, she fell for him and became his disciple.Dowman (1984), p. 265. The king became incensed and condemned them both to death in a fire which raged for seven days. After the smoke cleared there was a lake with a lotus in it, Rewalsar (Tibetan: Tso Pema or 'Lotus Lake'), which is situated about 24 km from Mandi.Stott and Dare (2009), p. 530. This convinced the king of the wisdom and power of Padmasambhava and he requested teachings from him and gave his daughter permission to pursue her religious destiny.Changchub and Nyingpo (1999), p. 235. The temple is sacred to both Tibetan Buddhists and Hindus, and was commonly visited by Tibetan pilgrims and traders before the invasion of Tibet by the Chinese when the borders were closed with India.

Spinoff  CareFusion was created in 2009 as a spinoff of medical technology businesses from Cardinal Health. It began publicly trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 1, 2009. Cardinal's core business was drug distribution, a low-margin and low-risk, predictable business, with which the higher-margin, higher-risk medical technology businesses were difficult to integrate. The spin-off was named after Care Fusion, a business Cardinal Health acquired in 2006 that was based in McLean, Virginia and sold wireless patient identification systems used in hospitals. It also included Cardinal's automated dispensing cabinet line, which had been acquired when Cardinal bought Pyxis Corporation in 1996 for $920 million. Pyxis had been founded in San Diego by Ronald R. Taylor and investor Tim Wollaeger in 1987 and had around 1,500 employees when it was acquired. Cardinal had acquired Pyxis as part of an earlier strategy to start selling higher-margin products. CareFusion also included assets acquired by Cardinal in 2004 through the acquisition of another San Diego company, Alaris Medical Systems, in 2004, for $2 billion. Alaris made intravenous drug pumps. Subsequent history In May 2010, CareFusion acquired Medegen, Inc. for US$ 225 million in cash. On February 1, 2011, Kieran T. Gallahue was named CareFusion's chairman and CEO. In April 2012, CareFusion sold the Nicolet operating unit to Natus Medical Incorporated for $58 million. On July 7, 2012, CareFusion acquired U.K. Medical Limited, a distributor of medical products to the National Health Service and private health care sector in the United Kingdom. In November 2012, CareFusion acquired Intermed Equipamento Medico Hospitalar Ltda, a privately held respiratory technologies company based in Cotia, Brazil. Intermed designs, manufactures and markets ventilators and respiratory care devices for infant, pediatric and adult patients that are used in hospitals in Brazil, Latin America and Europe. In November 2013, CareFusion acquired Vital Signs Inc., a medical device manufacturing business, with the exception of European operations from GE Healthcare. In 2013, CareFusion bought 40% of the Israeli company Caesarea Medical Electronics. In January 2014, the United States Department of Justice reached a USD $40.1 million settlement with CareFusion. The Department of Justice alleged that CareFusion violated the False Claims Act by promoting the sale of its drug ChloraPrep for uses that were not approved by the FDA. ChloraPrep is the commercial name under which CareFusion produced the drug chlorhexidine, used to clean the skin before surgery. In 2017, this case was called into question and came under review by the DOJ because the lead attorney for the DOJ serving as Assistant Attorney General in the case, Jeffery Wertkin, was arrested by the FBI on January 31, 2017 for allegedly attempting to sell a copy of a complaint in a secret whistleblower suit that was under seal. In October 2014, BD announced its acquisition of CareFusion for $58 USD per share in cash and stock, or a total of $12.2 billion. The acquisition was completed on March 17, 2015.

The river originates in the Seymour Range, flows westward through the San Juan Valley to Port San Juan at Port Renfrew. BCGNIS entry \\"San Juan River\\" History Early Spanish expeditions The First Nations of Vancouver Island have a legend of a Spanish trading schooner which arrived on the Island's southwestern coast in 1777. The Spanish anchored in the harbour and traded with the Nitinat Natives. The Spanish discovered gold in the San Juan River and tried to recover the gold. The Nitinat Natives slaughtered the Spanish expedition. Two Spanish women were taken as slaves. The women were later released to another Spanish expedition who discovered them. The later expedition inadvertently infected the Nitinat Natives with smallpox. There is some evidence to support this story. Spanish ships such as the Santiago investigated the west coast in the 1700s. There are also records of attacks on Spanish by First Nations. This is the first alleged discovery of gold in the San Juan River. Foster's Lost Mine In 1885 an American prospector named Foster found gold in the San Juan River. Foster returned in 1907 to find more gold. Every year Foster returned looking for the gold. He returned year after year because he couldn't find the original spot on the San Juan River. Foster died in 1917 in Salt Lake City. The people of Port Renfrew heard about Foster's search. Many people from Port Renfrew searched all over the San Juan River looking for Foster's old gold site. It was never discovered. Course Harris Creek, a major tributary of the San Juan River The San Juan River's headwaters take drainage from the southern slopes of the Seymour Range. Its largest fork begins at a small unnamed pond in Cowichan Valley Regional District and forms the primary headstream. From here the San Juan River flows southwest into \\"Pete's Pond\\" before continuing its descent south. It then enters the Capital Regional District before pooling briefly in a large unnamed pond. The river then continues south before meeting its first named tributary, Clapp Creek. From here the river swings west-southwest, growing considerably in size as continues down the valley. The San Juan River then meets its first major tributary, Fleet River. From here the river winds through a canyon before it opens up into a broad valley. It meets the major tributaries of Lens Creek and Harris Creek before meeting an outlet stream of Fairy Lake. From here the San Juan River meanders considerably and breaks off into a pair of major branches, forming a large estuary. The smaller northern branch meanders west before sharing an outlet to Port San Juan with the Gordon River. The larger southern branch meanders southwest and empties into Port San Juan just north of Port Renfrew. Estuary The San Juan River Estuary Ecological Reserve was established on 30 April 1996 in order to conserve the alluvial forest communities of the lower San Juan River and protect the red-listed tooth- leaved monkeyflower, endemic to British Columbia. It is classified as a strict nature reserve (IUCN Category Ia). The estuary is populated by a variety of trees, including red alder, black cottonwood, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock. Shrubs present in the estuary include salmonberry, stink currant, piggyback plants, lady fern, and deer fern. Wildlife of note that take residence in the estuary include American black bears, Roosevelt elk, North American river otters, bald eagles, and minks.

The resulting increase in settlement triggered nine years of armed conflict during the Maryland-Pennsylvania boundary dispute known as Cresap's War. The animal powered ferry was the very first means of crossing the broad unfriendly Susquehanna River in a region known as Conejohela Valley nearly halfway between what became Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and York County, Pennsylvania. Wright was a Quaker who first came to the area in 1724 to explore the land and preach to the local Native Americans. In 1730, he was granted a patent to operate a ferry across the river and subsequently established the ferry with Robert Barber and Samuel Blunston. He also built a ferry house and a tavern on the eastern shore of the Susquehanna, north of Locust Street, on Front Street in Wright's Ferry, as the town was then known. The two-story log tavern, operated by John Wright, Jr. until 1834, consisted of a large room on either end connected by a passageway. When John Jr. married, he moved to York County‚Äôs western shore at Wright's Ferry West (later to be named Wrightsville), and built another ferry house and tavern. The ferry itself consisted of two dugout canoes fastened together with carriage and wagon wheels. When numerous cattle were moved, the canoeist guided a lead animal with a rope so that the others would follow. If the lead animal became confused and started swimming in circles, however, the other animals followed until they tired and eventually drowned. Extracts from Columbia, Pennsylvania In 1724, John Wright, an English Quaker, traveled to the area (then a part of Chester County) to explore the land and proselytize to a Native American tribe, the Shawnee, who had established a settlement along a creek known as Shawnee Creek, which is still called that today. Wright built a log cabin near there on part of a tract of land first granted to George Beale by William Penn in 1699, and stayed for more than a year. The area was known as Shawanatown. When Wright returned in 1726 with Robert Barber and Samuel Blunston, he and the others began developing the area, with Wright building a house about a hundred yards from the edge of the Susquehanna River, in the area of South Second and Union Streets. This structure eventually became home to the Wright family, including sons John Jr. and James. One of his daughters, the poet and businesswoman Susanna, born in England in 1697, arrived in the area in 1718, and later moved to the family residence to help take care of her brothers and sisters after her mother died. Robert Barber constructed a saw mill in 1727 and years later built a home near the river, on the Washington Boro Pike, along what is now Route 441. The home still stands across from the Columbia Wastewater Treatment Plant and is the second oldest in the borough, after the Wright‚Äôs Ferry Mansion. Samuel Blunston constructed a mansion, which he named Bellmont, atop the hill next to North Second Street, near Chestnut Street, at the location of the present-day Rotary Park Playground. Upon his death, Blunston willed the mansion to Susanna Wright, who had become a close friend. She lived there, occasionally visiting brother James, ministering to the Native Americans, and raising silkworms for the local silk industry, until her death in 1784 at the age of 87. The residence was demolished in the late 1920s to allow for construction of the Veterans‚Äô Memorial Bridge. In 1730, John Wright was granted a patent to operate a ferry across the Susquehanna River and subsequently established the ferry, known as Wright's Ferry, with Barber and Blunston. He also built a ferry house and a tavern on the eastern shore, north of Locust Street, on Front Street. The two-story log tavern, operated by John Wright, Jr. until 1834, consisted of a large room on either end connected by a passageway. When John Jr. married, he moved to York County‚Äôs western shore, in what became Wrightsville, and built a ferry house and tavern. The ferry itself consisted of two dugout canoes fastened together with carriage and wagon wheels. When numerous cattle were moved, the canoeist guided a lead animal with a rope so that the others would follow. If the lead animal became confused and started swimming in circles, however, the other animals followed until they tired and eventually drowned. Traffic heading west from Lancaster, Philadelphia, and other nearby towns regularly traveled through Columbia, using the ferry to cross the Susquehanna. As traffic flow increased, the ferry grew, to the point of including canoes, rafts, flatboats, and steamboats, and was capable of handling Conestoga Wagons and other large vehicles. Due to the volume of traffic, however, wagons, freight, supplies and people often became backed up, creating a waiting period of several days to cross the river. With 150 to 200 vehicles lined up on the Columbia side, ferrymen used chalk to number the wagons. Typical fares were as follows: *Coach with four passengers and drawn by five horses-9 shillings; *4-horse wagon - 3 shillings and 9 pence; *Man and horse - 6 pence. Fares were reduced in 1787 due to competition from Anderson's Ferry, located further upstream, near Marietta. Wright‚Äôs Ferry was located immediately south of the Veterans Memorial Bridge along Route 462. In later years, Wright rented the ferry to others and eventually sold it. Founding father In 1729, after Wright had petitioned William Penn‚Äôs son to create a new county, the provincial government took land from Chester County to establish Lancaster County, the fourth county in Pennsylvania. County residents - Indians and colonists alike - regularly traveled to Wright‚Äôs home to file papers and claims, seek government assistance and redress of issues, and register land deeds. During this time, the town was called ‚ÄúWright‚Äôs Ferry.‚Äù In 1738, James Wright built the Wright‚Äôs Ferry Mansion, the oldest existing house in Columbia, for his family. The structure can still be seen at Second and Cherry Streets. Columbia Samuel Wright, son of James and Rhoda Wright, was born on May 12, 1754. He eventually became the town proprietor and created a public grounds company to administer the land. Through his trusteeship, the town‚Äôs first water distribution system (later The Columbia Water Company) was established and created, as well as ‚ÄúThe Washington Institute,‚Äù the town‚Äôs first school of higher learning, and the Locust Street Park, located next to what is now Locust Street and Route 462. In the spring of 1788 Samuel Wright had the area surveyed, and formally laid out the town into 160 building lots, which were chanced off by lottery at 15 shillings per ticket. \\"Adventurers\\" as purchasers were known, included speculators from many areas of the country. Wright and town citizens renamed the town ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù in honor of Christopher Columbus in the hope of influencing the U.S. Congress to select it as the nation‚Äôs capital, a plan George Washington favored.Sheldon, 2006, p. 38. A formal proposal to do so was made in 1789. Unfortunately for the town, when Congress voted in 1790, the final tally was one vote short. Later, Columbia narrowly missed becoming the capital of Pennsylvania. Harrisburg was chosen instead, since it is closer to the state‚Äôs geographical center. The third strikeout was despite its competitive location in regards to transportation, coal, and steel, resources, Columbia narrowly lost out to Detroit during the selection process for a center for the new automotive industry.

Professional hockey Heisinger made the jump to the NHL when he joined the original Winnipeg Jets hockey club as assistant equipment manager. Two years later, he was promoted to equipment manager and served in that capacity until the Jets left for Phoenix, Arizona in 1996. Heisinger, who had a young family at the time, decided not to move with the team. Instead, he accepted an offer to be the equipment manager for Winnipeg's new International Hockey League team, the Manitoba Moose. Heisinger served as the equipment manager of the Moose for three seasons. International Heisinger's first international stint came in 1988, when he served as a trainer for Team Canada at the World Junior Hockey Championship in Moscow, where Canada won the gold medal. In 1997, he was a member of Team Canada's training staff at the World Ice Hockey Championships, where Canada also won gold. In his most prominent international role, he was selected as the Equipment Manager for Canada's men's ice hockey team at the 1998 Winters Olympics in Nagano, Japan, the first Olympics in which NHL players were allowed to compete.

(2012) Garbology: Our dirty love affair with trash. Avery, 264 pp. Fifty five percent of this waste is contributed as residential garbage, while the remaining forty five percent of waste in the U.S.'s ‚Äòwaste stream' comes from manufacturing, retailing, and commercial trade in the U.S. economy.https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/29/idUS108659+29-May-2008+PRN20080529 March 2008, Cashing in on Climate Change, IBISWorld Based on proprietary data released to the public, Nevada was named America's \\"Most Wasteful State\\" for the years 2005-2010; where each resident threw away over 14 pounds of non- recycled, unreused items, often ending up into landfills and incinerators per day, eight pounds over the national state daily throwaway average. \\"Wasteful\\" states Michigan, New Mexico, Wisconsin and Oregon as well as Washington also dominated the list's 5-year period. Definitions Waste may be defined differently in legislation and regulations of the federal government or individual states. Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations dealing with protection of the environment contains at least four different definitions of waste at sections 60.111b, 61.341, 191.12 and 704.83. Definitions may apply broadly to solid, liquid, and gaseous forms or may be specific to one or a subset identified by a threshold characteristic such as toxicity or radioactivity. Discarding, discharge, or disposal (as opposed to sales) is often a requirement for identification as waste, although stored or recycled material may be included within some definitions; and those definitions may reduce recycling options.King, James J. The Environmental Dictionary (1995) John Wiley & Sons p.745 Comparative quantification of waste may be difficult if the waste material is intentionally diluted in a handling or disposal process (such as diluting sanitary waste with clean water in the process of flushing a toilet.) Dilution may remove a material from a definition of waste by reducing concentrations below a defined toxicity or radioactivity threshold. Electronic waste Electronic waste have become an ever-growing problem in the United States. Each year, over 3.2 million tons of electronic waste is put in US landfills. A large portion of this electronic waste is computers, monitors, and televisions. Over 100 million computers, monitors, and televisions are disposed of yearly in the U.S. Although there is an enormous amount of electronic waste in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency found that in 2009 approximately only about 25% of all electronic waste is recycled in the United States. About 70% of metals that are found in the United States landfills come from electronic devices. The disposure of all this electronic waste has a detrimental effect on the environment, as well as the global economy. Environmental effects Electronic waste has become serious issue for the environmental stability in the United States. Over the years, the government has become increasingly more involved in this issue. As described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery report of 2009, after the electronic products are purchased and used, they are separated into two groups. One group of electronics is collected for recycling, while the other is disposal. After this, the products that are disposal mainly are put into landfills, and the rest of electronics that were collected for recycling are either refurbished, reused, or used for material. Hans Tammemagi, the author of The Waste Crisis, talks about the detrimental effect the waste has on the environment. Nearly 20% of all waste in the United States is being incinerated, while the rest of it is being put into landfills. That leaves almost 80% of the waste consumed in the United States being placed into landfills. Out of this 80% of the waste, the majority of this waste is primarily electronic. From fluorescent light bulbs to common household batteries, every piece of electronic waste that is found in landfills contains some kind of metal. One of the most commonly used metals in electronic waste is lead. Lead is found in most batteries, in the form of lead-acid, and it is also found in CRTs (cathode ray tube). These tubes are primarily used in television screens, as well as computer monitors. Since so many televisions, computer monitors, and batteries are place into landfills that means that most landfills have a large amount of lead in them, which is dangerous to the local environment. This is because the lead, like most hazardous materials that are in landfills, can be absorbed into the soil and ground water. Being exposed to a high level of lead can cause various health issues such as blood and brain disorders, comas, and in serious cases even death. Lead is not the only hazardous metal in U.S. landfills. For example, mercury, beryllium, and chromium are just some of the other metals that are in our landfills that are extremely hazardous to the environment, as well as to human health. Trade Recycling is not the only issue surrounding electronic waste‚Äôs effects. The economy and trade of raw materials also plays a significant role in the economic issue of electronic waste. In the online journal Chemosphere, Jeffrey D. Weidenhamer and Michael L. Clement claim in their article, ‚ÄúLeaded Electronic Waste is a Possible Source Material for Lead-contaminated Jewelry‚Äù that the majority of electronic waste, which is produced in the United States, is exported to numerous Asian countries, primarily China, for material recovery. This is because the Chinese economy is increasing rapidly, and they have created a need for raw materials, which come from the electronic waste that the United States produces. After being shipped overseas to China, the electronic waste is then stripped of parts in small Chinese workshops. Because so much of electronic waste has very hazardous material, especially dangerous metals, this creates a hazardous work environment for the people who work on stripping the electronics for spare parts. China does not have strict environmental regulations, so the electronic waste imported from America, which is not stripped for spare parts, ends up in large dumps in communal areas. This creates a very hazardous living environment for people who live near these dumps. There have been several different cases were people, primarily children, become very sick, or even die because of the exposure to all the hazardous material found in the waste dumps in China. A major reason that the United States trades the majority of their electronic waste to other countries to harvest raw materials is due to environmental issues. The book, Electronic Waste: EPA Needs to Better Control Harmful U. S. Exports through Stronger Enforcement and More Comprehensive Regulation, by John B. Stephenson, discusses the environmental and economic aspects of electronic waste in the United States. Throughout the last few years, the U. S. Government has recognized the environmental issue that landfills create, and has been creating bans on U.S. landfill. Although this may create more environmental stability in the United States, it has become a major environmental and health issue in the countries to which the electronic waste is being shipped.

The mosque partially collapsed in 1919, but was later refurbished in 1998 by the Dawoodi Bohras, who trace their religious lineage to the Fatimid Caliphate. It is located in the southern cemetery in the Moqattam hills. Geography The mosque is located near the southern cemetery of the Muqattam Hills, a low range of hills to the east of Cairo. It has an average height of with the highest peak at above sea level. It is divided into three sections. The highest segment is a low mountain landform called Moqattam Mountain. It was an important ancient Egyptian quarry site for limestone, used in construction of mosques and churches. The Lulua Mosque was also built with this limestone. The mosque is close to this hill range. The mosque is about from the Sharia Salah Salim, towards the southeast. History Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim (996‚Äì1021), the third caliph in Egypt of the Ismaili Shia Dynasty, also credited with building Cairo, built this mosque among many small mosques that were built on the Muqattam Hill. It is told that Hakim used to visit the mosque alone in nights for worship. Etymologically the name al-Lu'lu'a means \\"the pearl\\" as the mosque's exterior appearance was ornate and lustrous. Features File:Renovated Qibla Lulua mosque.jpg|Renovated Qibla Lulua mosque, Cairo The Fatimid mosque was built on a promontory of limestone, precariously perched as a detached component of the hill range. The exposed limestone formed the foundation for the mosque structure. The mosque was built in the unique Fatimid architectural style. It is one of the early mosques built in Egypt, where the typical Fatimid architectural style, which involved portals with slight protrusions, mihrabs and qibla walls (covered by ornamentation) topped by domes indicative of the place of worship, columned porches with triple arches or keel shaped arches, frontage with inscriptions could be seen. The Lulua Mosque consisted originally of a three-storey tower-like structure built over a rectangular plan. The ground floor was partially excavated from the hill. It was barrel vaulted having triple arched entrance, simple qibla (mihrab) on the back wall at each floor( multiple qibla in one mosque a unique feature for this mosque) and was constructed of limestone with rubble. The upper stories were constructed with bricks and interior wall plastered. One of these upper stories also had triple arched entrance; the arches were built with brick and stone. The middle floor, barrel vaulted, had an ornamented qibla (Mihrab) at back and one rectangular window. The top floor had two compartments, each having one window. The vaults at the upper floors were built with brick. Historical photo placed confirm many details. Some of the architectural features common to all mosques built by Al-Hakim, including Lulua Mosque, are adoption of projected portals and domes over mihrabs for ceremonial purposes. Keel-shaped arches in porticoes and arcades were also prominent features. The profusion of fine stucco decorations were seen in large numbers, particularly on mihrabs and qibla walls. Iconographic inscriptions were abundant on the fa√ßade. The first reported refurbishing of the mosque was in the 16th century. After its fa√ßade and vaults collapsed in 1919, the mosque was refurbished by India's Dawoodi Bohra community in the late 1990s.Williams, Williams (2008), p. 129 The Bohras trace their religious lineage to the IsmƒÅ øƒ´lƒ´ Islam practiced by the Fatimid Caliphate.

Cell division is a normal process used by the body for growth and repair. A parent cell divides to form two daughter cells, and these daughter cells are used to build new tissue or to replace cells that have died because of aging or damage. Healthy cells stop dividing when there is no longer a need for more daughter cells, but cancer cells continue to produce copies. They are also able to spread from one part of the body to another in a process known as metastasis. Breast cancer cells  Classification  There are different categories of cancer cell, defined according to the cell type from which they originate. * Carcinoma, the majority of cancer cells are epithelial in origin, beginning in the membranous tissues that line the surfaces of the body. * Leukaemia, originate in the tissues responsible for producing new blood cells, most commonly in the bone marrow. * Lymphoma and myeloma, derived from cells of the immune system. * Sarcoma, originating in connective tissue, including fat, muscle and bone. * Central nervous system, derived from cells of the brain and spinal cord. * Mesothelioma, originating in the mesothelium; the lining of body cavities.

The nucleus is often large and irregular, and the cytoplasm may also display abnormalities.  Nucleus  The shape, size, protein composition, and texture of the nucleus are often altered in malignant cells. The nucleus may acquire grooves, folds or indentations, chromatin may aggregate or disperse, and the nucleolus can become enlarged. In normal cells, the nucleus is often round or ellipsoid in shape, but in cancer cells the outline is often irregular. Different combinations of abnormalities are characteristic of different cancer types, to the extent that nuclear appearance can be used as a marker in cancer diagnostics and staging. Causes Cancer cells are created when the genes responsible for regulating cell division are damaged. Carcinogenesis is caused by mutation and epimutation of the genetic material of normal cells, which upsets the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division in the body. The uncontrolled and often rapid proliferation of cells can lead to benign or malignant tumours (cancer). Benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body or invade other tissues. Malignant tumors can invade other organs, spread to distant locations (metastasis) and become life-threatening. More than one mutation is necessary for carcinogenesis. In fact, a series of several mutations to certain classes of genes is usually required before a normal cell will transform into a cancer cell. Damage to DNA can be caused by exposure to radiation, chemicals, and other environmental sources, but mutations also accumulate naturally over time through uncorrected errors in DNA transcription, making age another risk factor. Oncoviruses can cause certain types of cancer, and genetics are also known to play a role.What causes cancer? : Cancer Research UK : CancerHelp UK. Cancerhelp.org.uk (2010-07-15).

However, a lack of particular co-stimulated molecules that aid in the way antigens react with lymphocytes can impair the natural killer cells' function, ultimately leading to cancer. Pathology Cells playing roles in the immune system, such as T-cells, are thought to use a dual receptor system when they determine whether or not to kill sick or damaged human cells. If a cell is under stress, turning into tumors, or infected, molecules including MIC-A and MIC-B are produced so that they can attach to the surface of the cell. These work to help macrophages detect and kill cancer cells.The Adaptive Immune System: Ways That Antibodies Help to Defend the Body - Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) .

In 2016, a 1.7 million year old osteosarcoma was reported by Edward John Odes (a doctoral student in Anatomical Sciences from Witwatersrand Medical School, South Africa) and colleagues, representing the oldest documented malignant hominin cancer. The understanding of cancer was significantly advanced during the Renaissance period and in to the Age of Discovery. Sir Rudolf Virchow, a German biologist and politician, studied microscopic pathology, and linked his observations to illness. He is described as \\"the founder of cellular pathology\\". In 1845, Virchow and John Hughes Bennett independently observed abnormal increase in white blood cells in patients. Virchow correctly identified the condition as blood disease, and named it leuk√§mie in 1847 (later anglicised to leukemia). In 1857, he was the first to describe a type of tumour called chordoma that originated from the clivus (at the base of the skull). Telomerase Cancer cells have unique features that make them \\"immortal\\" according to some researchers. The enzyme telomerase is used to extend the cancer cell's life span. While the telomeres of most cells shorten after each division, eventually causing the cell to die, telomerase extends the cell's telomeres. This is a major reason that cancer cells can accumulate over time, creating tumors.  Cancer stem cells and drug resistance  A diagram illustrating the distinction between cancer stem cell targeted and conventional cancer therapies Scientists have discovered a molecule on the surface of tumors that appears to promote drug resistance‚Äîby converting the tumor cells back into a stem cell-like state. When the tumor cells began to exhibit drug resistance, the cells were simultaneously transforming into a stem cell-like state, which made them impervious to the drugs. It appeared that the treatment itself was driving this transformation by activating a specific molecular pathway. Luckily, several existing drugs, such as Bortezomib for example, can attack this pathway and reverse the cellular transformation, thus ‚Äòre-sensitizing‚Äô the tumor to treatment.Cancer stem cells linked to drug resistanceTumor Cells Become Drug Resistant by Reverting to a Stem Cell-Like StateLaetitia Seguin, Shumei Kato, Aleksandra Franovic, et al., & David A.

A commitment device is, according to journalist Stephen J. Dubner and economist Steven Levitt, a way to lock yourself into following a plan of action that you might not want to do but you know is good for you. In other words, a commitment device is a way to give yourself a reward or punishment to make an empty promise stronger and believable. A commitment device is a technique where someone makes it easier for themselves to avoid akrasia (acting against one's better judgment), particularly procrastination. Commitment devices have two major features. They are voluntarily adopted for use and they tie consequences to follow-through failures. Consequences can be immutable (irreversible, such as a monetary consequence) or mutable (allows for the possibility of future reversal of the consequence). Overview Odysseus lashed to the mast by his first mate. Depicted by the Siren Painter. The term \\"commitment device\\" is used in both economics and game theory. In particular, the concept is relevant to the fields of economics and especially the study of decision making (Brocas, et al.). A common example comes from mythology: Odysseus' plan to survive hearing the sirens' song without jumping overboard. Economist Jodi Beggs writes \\"Commitment devices are a way to overcome the discrepancy between an individual's short-term and long-term preferences; in other words, they are a way for self-aware people to modify their incentives or set of possible choices in order to overcome impatience or other irrational behavior. You know the story of Ulysses tying himself to the mast so that he couldn't be lured in by the song of the Sirens? You can think of that as the quintessential commitment device\\" (Beggs 2009). Behavioral economist Daniel Goldstein describes how commitment devices established in \\"cold states\\" help and protect themselves against impulsive decisions in later, emotional, stimulated, \\"hot states\\". Goldstein says that, despite their usefulness, commitment devices nevertheless have drawbacks. Namely, they still rely on some self-control. Goldstein says that, for one, a commitment device can promote learned helplessness in the agent. If the agent enters a situation where the device does not incentivize commitment, the agent may not have enough will power or ability to control themselves. (Goldstein uses the example of a cake falling into the grey area of a diet, so it is eaten excessively.) Second, commitment devices can usually be reversed. (An unplugged distracting electronic can be plugged back in.) Goldstein says \\"In effect you are like Odysseus and the first mate in one person. You're binding yourself, and then you're weaseling your way out of it, and then you're beating yourself up for it afterwards.\\" Methods * Create larger obstacles to temptations to increase the costs of temptations. * Make your commitment public, so your reputation may be affected. * Make a bet or monetary contract with someone to increase the benefit of keeping your promise. Challenges It can be challenging to promote uptake of commitment devices. In the field of health, for example, commitment devices have the potential to increase patient adherence to their health goals, but utilization of these techniques is low. Health professionals can potentially increase patient uptake of commitment devices by increasing their accessibility, making policies opt-out, and leveraging patients‚Äô social networks. Other examples A soldier receives a Medal of Honor. Game theorists suggest that human cultural constructs like \\"Honor\\" might function as commitment devices.Examples of commitment devices abound. Dubner and Levitt give the example of Han Xin, a general in Ancient China, who positioned his soldiers with their backs to a river, making it impossible for them to flee, thereby leaving them no choice but to attack the enemy head-on. They also present various commitment devices related to weight loss (2007). In addition, some game theorists have argued that human emotions and sense of honor are forms of commitment device (Arslan 2011 & Ross and Dumouchel 2004). Other examples include announcing commitments publicly and mutually assured destruction (Straker 2011), as well as software programs that block internet access for a predetermined period of time.

Nagaiah as Dasaratharamaiah * Dhulipala as Haridasu * Nagabhushanam as Srinivasulu * Chalam as Anjaneyulu * Raja Babu as Bhuta Vaidyudu * Sakshi Ranga Rao as Postmaster * Mada Venkateswara Rao as Sriramulu * Arja Janardhana Rao as Venkateswarlu * Shavukaru Janaki as Tulasamma * Anjali Devi as the goddess Goddess Lakshmi (cameo) * Suryakantham as Papayamma * Suryakala as Seshu * Meenakumari as Sumathi  Production  Adurthi Subba Rao bought the Telugu remake rights of the Marathi film Thamb Laxmi Kunku Lavte (1968). While writing the screenplay of the remake, titled Undamma Bottu Pedata, he retained the essence of the original's story with its climax, but made many other changes such as introducing new characters, mainly to suit the interests of Telugu-speaking audiences. Subba Rao also intended to direct the film and produce it under his banner Babu Movies, but the success of his Hindi directorial venture Milan (1967) led to him receiving more directorial offers from Bollywood producers; after accepting to direct Man Ka Meet (1969) for Sunil Dutt's Ajanta Arts, he entrusted his protege K. Viswanath with directing Undamma Bottu Pedata. Mahadevshastri Joshi, the writer of Thamb Laxmi Kunku Lavte, was erroneously credited in the remake's title card as Madhav Shastri Joshi. The dialogues were written by N. R. Nandi, cinematography was handled by K. S. Ramakrishna and editing by Kotagiri Gopala Rao.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by K. V. Mahadevan, with lyrics written by Devulapalli Krishnasastri.  Release and reception  Undamma Bottu Pedata was released on 28 September 1968. The film was an average success, having completed only a 62-day run in Vijaywada.  References   External links  * Category:1968 drama films Category:1968 films Category:Films directed by K.

Alles (November 26, 1901 ‚Äì January 21, 1963), was an American chemist and pharmacologist who did extensive research on the isolation and properties of insulin for the treatment of diabetics. He is also credited with discovering and publishing the physiological effects of amphetamine and methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine. Nicolas Rasmussen (2008). He is the first person to have prepared amphetamine sulfate, although not the amphetamine molecule. Alles first reported the physiological properties of amphetamine as a synthetic analog of ephedrine, and therefore received credit for this discovery.Staff, (1963) Gordon A. Alles. The Month at Caltech. Engineering and Science, 26 (5). pp. 18-19. ISSN 0013-7812] He enjoyed large royalties from Smith, Kline & French (SKF) because he sold his patent rights for amphetamine to the company and it enjoyed large sales. Several popular products sold by SKF contained amphetamine, including Benzedrine pills and inhalers, Dexedrine pills and Dexamyl tablets. Counterfeit drugs such as Profetamine (a generic form of amphetamine sulfate) appeared, aiming to circumvent Alles' 'weak' patent. Career Alles received his BS (1922), MS (1924), and PhD (1926) degrees from California Institute of Technology (Caltech). From 1931 he was a lecturer in pharmacology at the University of California Medical School in San Francisco, and from 1951 he was Professor in Residence of pharmacology at UCLA. From 1934 to 1951 he was a consultant for the SKF laboratories.University of California History. Los Angeles: Departments. He was owner of the Alles Chemical Research Laboratories in Pasadena, and had been a Caltech research associate since 1939. In 1958 he gave Caltech a gift of $350,000 which financed, in large part, the five-story Gordon A. Alles Laboratory for Molecular Biology. Alles was primarily interested in natural and synthetic drug chemicals and the relationship between their molecular structures and their biological actions.Schultes, Richard Evans; Ethnobotany: Evolution of a discipline In 1928 he discovered the physiological properties of benzedrine (amphetamine) and he contributed to its development as a drug. This drug and dextroamphetamine, which was developed from the discovery, have had worldwide medical use as general brain stimulants. Alles also spent time in Tahiti, where he was investigating the possibilities of developing tranquilizers from alkaloids in a native drink called kava.

Khera completed a Ph.D. in economics at the Delhi School of Economics. She did her schooling from Convent of Jesus and Mary, Baroda http://hss.iitd.ac.in/faculty/reetika-khera and collaborates often with noted economist and activist, Jean Dr√®ze. She has received fellowships from the Institute for Economic Growth, the Commonwealth Scholarship Scheme, King's College London, and from Princeton University (for a project with Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton). Career Reetika Khera is one of India's leading development economists. Currently, she is Associate Professor (Economics and Public Systems Group) at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad; and is on leave from her post as Sulaiman Mutawa Associate Chair Professor in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. Khera is a highly visible, seminal advocate for improved welfare programs in the country and actively helped to implement India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). She has worked with the G. B. Pant Social Science Institute, Allahabad University and is a visitor at the Centre for Development Economics at the Delhi School of Economics. She has also published several research papers analyzing NREGA, the Public Distribution System (PDS) and other programs that affect India's most vulnerable citizens. One of her most important projects is the \\"Group Measurement,\\" which evaluated the impact the NREGA project has had on India's citizens‚Äîthat effort is titled, \\"The Jalore Experiment\\".Reetika Khera at IDEAS In October 2017, she was in residence as an External Faculty Fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center and was nominated for the post (by the Center for South Asia) to edit a book on India's Aadhaar program. Khera has penned columns and been profiled in the mainstream media in India‚Äîfor outlets such as NDTV, Scroll.in, Wire.in, Outlook India, Financial Times, Reuters, Bloomberg Quint, Quartz, Magnum Foundation, Indian Express, Business Standard, Business Line, Economic Times, Frontline (she wrote the Nov 2016 cover feature), Business Today (she wrote the Jan 2016 cover feature) and the BBC. She is frequently interviewed on Indian television in English and Hindi and in alternative Indian media (such as Newslaundry, Counterview.org (she wrote a feature piece on Aadhaar), Deccan Herald, Livemint, South Asia Citizens Web, Countercurrents, India Together and India Spend (she wrote a cover story on NREGA)). In January 2018, her NYT editorial, \\"Why India's Big Fix is a Big Flub,\\" was one of the most comprehensive public arguments ever made on the limitations of Aadhaar. Khera describes how the program aimed to biometrically register India's 1.3 billion residents in an even-handed, judicious way. But although millions enrolled, the program remains riddled with colossal privacy and corruption challenges. In November 2017, Khera filed a \\"Right to Information\\" (RTI) request with the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to solicit public data on how much the agency spent to advertise and promote Aadhaar, since the program started in 2009. UIDAI has not commented or responded to the RTI request. In her January New York Times editorial, Khera argues: > Aadhaar was supposed to showcase the government‚Äôs forward thinking about > efficient administration; it has only exposed the state‚Äôs coerciveness. It > was supposed to ease the poor‚Äôs access to welfare; it has hurt the neediest. > It was supposed to harness technology in the service of development; it has > made people‚Äôs personal data vulnerable. One of the Indian government‚Äôs > biggest banner projects has become a glaring example of all that can go > wrong with policy making in this country. As part of an April 2018 story in the New York Times, Khera highlights how India's poorest classes are among those Aadhaar has harmed the most. Rather than being aided by the program, Khera states that, \\"This is the population that is being passed off as ghosts and bogus by the government.\\" PEEP Survey 2013 Her most cited peer-reviewed papers are: * Reetika Khera and Nandini Nayak \\"Women Workers and Perceptions of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act\\" Economic and Political Weekly Vol. 44, No. 43 (24-30 October 2009), pp. 49‚Äì57 (cited 137 times according to Google Scholar) *Jean Dreze and Reetika Khera \\"The battle for employment guarantee\\" World Bank Frontiers (cited 139 times according to Google Scholar.)

Dal Lake includes 3 islands, 2 of which are marked with beautiful Chinar trees. The island located on the Bod Dal is known as Roph Lank (Silver Island), is marked with the presence of majestic Chinar trees at the four corners, thus known as Char-Chinari (Four Chinars). The second Chinar Island, known as Sone Lank (Gold Island), is located on the Lokut Dal, and over looks the holy shrine of Hazratbal.  History  Murad Baksh, brother of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, constructed the Roph Lank. Char Chinar at Dal Lake  Chinar  Chinar trees characteristically grow in Eastern Himalayas. There botanical name is Platanus orientalis. They have been an important part of Kashmiri tradition, in that, a Chinar tree is found in almost every village in Kashmir. These trees have survived for ages, because Chinar is basically a long-living tree. It spreads wide across a region of cool climate with sufficient water. The tree has several properties - leaves and bark are used as medicine, the wood, known as lace wood has been used for delicate furniture and the twigs and roots are used for making dyes.  Decline and restoration  Chinar all over Jammu and Kashmir have been affected due to various reasons such as indiscriminate felling and floods. It is common to find locals and media houses reporting that the four chinar at Char Chinar no longer are as majestic as they use to be. Three of the four trees have shown signs of drying up. Some locals blame construction on the island whereas others blame recent floods and climate change. The floriculture department of Jammu and Kashmir is making efforts to restore the island to its former glory and have also planted more Chinar trees on the island.

The model was designed to accommodate a wide variety of silvicultural and harvesting systems and natural disturbance events (e.g., fire, wind, insect epidemics) in order to compare and contrast their effect on forest productivity, stand dynamics, and a series of biophysical indicators of non-timber values. Model description Projection of stand growth and ecosystem dynamics is based upon a representation of the rates of key ecological processes regulating the availability of, and competition for, light and nutrient resources (a representation of moisture effects on soil processes, plant physiology and growth, and the consequences of moisture competition is being added). The rates of these processes are calculated from a combination of historical bioassay data (such as biomass accumulation in plant components and changes in stand density over time) and measures of certain ecosystem variables (including decomposition rates, photosynthetic saturation curves, and plant tissue nutrient concentrations) by relating ‚Äòbiologically active‚Äô biomass components (foliage and small roots) to calculated values of nutrient uptake, the capture of light energy, and net primary production. Using this ‚Äòinternal calibration‚Äô or hybrid approach, the model generates a suite of growth properties for each tree and understory plant species that is to be represented in a subsequent simulation. These growth properties are used to model growth as a function of resource availability and competition. They include (but are not limited to): (1) photosynthetic efficiency per unit foliage biomass and its nitrogen content based on relationships between foliage nitrogen, simulated self-shading, and net primary productivity after accounting for litterfall and mortality; (2) nutrient uptake requirements based on rates of biomass accumulation and literature- or field-based measures of nutrient concentrations in different biomass components on sites of different nutritional quality (i.e. fertility); (3) light-related measures of tree and branch mortality derived from stand density and live canopy height input data in combination with simulated vertical light profiles. Light levels at which mortality of branches and individual trees occur are estimated for each species. Many of FORECAST‚Äôs calculations are made at the stand level, but the model includes a sub-model which disaggregates stand-level productivity into the growth of individual stems with user-supplied information on stem size distributions at different stand ages. Top height and DBH are calculated for each stem and used in a taper function to calculate total and individual gross and merchantable volumes. Snags and logs are created in the model from natural stand self- thinning (mainly due to light competition) and from different types of user- defined disturbance events such as insect/disease-induced mortality, windthrow, non-commercial thinning and stand harvesting. Snag fall rates and log-decomposition are simulated using species-specific and tree-size-specific decay parameters derived from the literature, expert opinion, or field measurements. The process of model application FORECAST has four stages in its application: 1) data assembly and input verification, 2) establishing the ecosystem condition for the beginning of a simulation run (by simulating the known or assumed history of the site), 3) defining a management and/or natural disturbance regime, and 4) simulating this regime and analyzing model output. The first two stages represent model calibration. Calibration data are assembled that describe the accumulation of biomass (above and below-ground components) in trees and minor vegetation for three chronosequences of stands, each one developed under relatively homogeneous site conditions, representing three different nutritional site qualities. Tree biomass and stand self- thinning rate data are often generated from the height, DBH and stand density output of traditional growth and yield models in conjunction with species- specific component biomass allometric equations. To calibrate the nutritional aspects of the model, data describing the concentration of nutrients in the various biomass components are required. FORECAST also requires data on the degree of shading produced by different quantities of foliage and the photosynthetic response of foliage to different light levels (photosynthetic light saturation curves for either average foliage or separately for sun and shade adapted foliage). A comparable but simpler set of data for minor vegetation must be provided if the user wishes to represent this ecosystem component. Lastly, data describing the rates of decomposition of various litter types and soil organic matter are required for the model to simulate nutrient cycling. Simulation of soil leaching losses and certain measures of soil nutrient availability require input data that define cation and anion exchange capacity data for organic matter and mineral soil, and sorption- desorption processes. The second aspect of calibration requires running the model in ‚Äúset-up‚Äù mode to establish initial site conditions. The detailed representation of many different litter types and soil organic matter conditions makes it impractical to measure initial litter and soil pools and conditions directly in the field; consequently, the model is used to generate starting conditions. Complexity of the model As an ecosystem level model FORECAST offers the user the ability to represent a high degree of complexity in vegetation (multiple species and different life forms), plant community structure (canopy layering as a simple even-age single canopy layer or a complex multi-age, multi canopy) and population, community and ecosystem processes. However, the model can be simplified to any desired level of complexity that matches the user‚Äôs interests, specific application and data availability. In its simplest form it can be run as a single age cohort, plant monoculture, light competition model. At the other extreme the model can be used to simulate succession and disturbance responses in a complex multi species, multi age cohort ecosystem-level application with population, community and ecosystem processes represented with light, nutrient and moisture effects and their interactions, and the possibility to examine potential climate change effects. Model extensions and linkages FORECAST has been extended to a spatially explicit landscape local level (LLEMS), a spatially explicit individual tree model FORCEE, and to an interactive 3-D visualization (CALP Forester), FORECAST has been linked to a variety of landscape-level models such as ATLAS and DYNA-PLAN. The model has been used as the foundation for two educational applications (FORTOON and POSSIBLE FOREST FUTURES) Model evaluation FORECAST has been validated against field data for a range of growth and yield and structural variables in: coastal Western Hemlock zone in British Columbia, coastal Douglas-fir forests, and interior mixedwood forests in British Columbia History of model application FORECAST model has been applied to a variety of forest types: mixed Douglas- fir and paper birch forest,Sachs, D.

When a water request from Lake Mead is made, it takes time to travel the canal system to its destination. If the request is changed or canceled before it reaches its destination, the water is diverted to Brock Reservoir for storage. It has a small maximum volume of only , but is expected to be filled and emptied many times each year. It holds water from the All-American Canal until it can be used for nearby agriculture.  Structure  The reservoir sits on about , and consists of two basins. The basins are enclosed by earthen berms lined with polyethylene and covered with a layer of soil cement. A inlet channel connects the reservoir to the All-American Canal with a canal and siphon system returning the water to the All-American Canal for use by farmers. Engineers filled the reservoir starting in mid-October 2010 to test for leaks. Over a 28-day period no leaks were found and the reservoir only lost of water due to evaporation. The reservoir will only be used and filled with water that is not used from the canal due to rain providing farmers the needed water. The water saved in the reservoir will then be used when needed by farmers. The reservoir is operated remotely by the Imperial Irrigation District, which supplies water to farmers in California. The district can open and close the inlet and outlet gates and regulate the amount of water diverted into the reservoir and returned to the main system.  Background  The reservoir, named after an Imperial Valley farmer and agriculture researcher Warren H. Brock, solves the problem of unused Colorado River water in the All- American Canal being 'lost' to Mexico. When water is ordered by communities and farmers near the All American Canal, water is released from storage at Lake Mead. The water takes about five days to reach the region, by which time rain may have provided the needed water. With no local storage, the water continues flowing into Mexico. The idea for the reservoir came following the 2007 drought-management plan adopted by the seven states along the Colorado River. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimates the project could save as much as of water a year. The project was approved in 2008 and construction finished in October 2010. The project cost an estimated $172 million. The three major water districts in the area contributed to the funding of the project with the Southern Nevada Water Authority contributing $115 million and the Central Arizona Project and Metropolitan Water District of Southern California contributing $28.6 million each. In return for their contribution, Nevada can use of water over 20 years and Arizona and California can each use starting in 2016. Nevada contributed the most funds for construction because of its risk of running out of water. The more funds contributed to the project, the larger share of saved water the state would receive.

Based in Singapore, the alliance aims to create and deliver commercial benefits to its members and create the best content in Southeast Asia that has the potential to reach half a billion viewers. History On 24 March 2009, six Southeast Asian television broadcasting companies forged an alliance to cooperate along three areas ‚Äî content, sales and marketing, and technology ‚Äî and capitalise on the economies of scale and combined market that the region can offer. They signed a memorandum of understanding to form the Smart Alliance. As a region, member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) alone presents a combined market size of more than half a billion viewers and a growing middle-class population with increasingly substantial spending powers. The alliance is well positioned to exploit economies of scale both as a supplier of coveted content as well as a buyer of technology and equipment. For advertisers and clients, the alliance will be able to deliver marketing and promotional solutions on a regional platform. In March 2010, in celebration of the alliance's first year, Smart Alliance members gathered in Manila, Philippines to formally sign an Equipment and Facilities Lease Agreement which aims to share facilities among member companies to reduce operating and equipment costs; and an agreement on a website that aims to create an online portal that will provide information about the alliance to various stakeholders. Although not part of their original agenda, the group also signed an agreement formalizing a joint sales package launched by the group according to their goal of boosting regional revenue through jointly led strategies and new target markets to enable the alliance to gain a competitive advantage in a sustainable manner.

Goldstein can be briefly seen in the film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Sixteen Candles, as all of the classic Hughes' films were shot during the years he attended Glenbrook North High School and utilized students as featured extras. A chance encounter with John Hughes in 1987, during which Goldstein and Hughes performed the song, \\"Good Love\\", in front of a gymnasium filled with students, foreshadowed his employment as Hughes' personal and creative assistant during the pre- production of Home Alone 2 and throughout the production of the film. As a teen he attended the London School of Dramatic Arts and the Art Institute of Chicago before graduating from Syracuse University in 1990. He is the grandson of Cecilia Dubin, the Russian concert pianist.  Media career  Goldstein was a photojournalist for the New York New Times in the late 1980s, a writer for the Chicago Tribune in the early 1990s, and a television news commentator and field reporter for FOX News and NBC, including the on-air host of Too Much Information, a television news magazine for Fox News in Chicago. He also wrote, directed and produced television for A&E; Network, The History Channel, BET, TF-1, BBC, PBS, Fox Broadcasting Company and NBC. Goldstein co-produced, directed and edited the several documentary specials including The Angel of Bergen-Belsen and \\"Copycat Crimes\\", which were released by A&E; Network, and received an Emmy from the Chicago Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for his production of the children‚Äôs television program There‚Äôs No Such Thing as a Chanukah Bush, Sandy Goldstein, in 1995. In 2011, he became the bureau chief for Wizard Magazine's \\"Games, Girls, Gadgets and Gear\\" and Wizard World Comic Cons. His column, \\"State of the Game\\", appears weekly in Wizard World magazine. On April 29 he celebrated the launch of the speaking tour for his book, \\"The Way of the Nerd: Practical Advice for Impractical People,\\" at the 2011 Anaheim Comic Con  The Way of the Nerd series and other books Ken Goldstein has said that the first book in his ten part series The Way of the Nerd: Practical Advice for Impractical People has been in the works for twenty years but took only twenty hours to write. The book was completed in the Spring of 2011. An early draft of the book leaked onto the internet in July 2011 and became a popular internet download. The book, which is available in retail stores as well as on-line vendors, is also the subject of Goldstein's lecture series, The Day of the Nerd. Goldstein is currently writing the second book in the series, The Way of the Nerd: Actually I am Going to Tell You What to do with Your Life, which is set to be released in hard back and ebook formats in October 2012. Though all of the books in this series are based on the writings of Lao Tzu and his titular work Tao Te Ching each book incorporates a wide variety of spiritual teachings from Kabbalah, Catholicism, Judaism, Sufism and Muslim. In July 2012 Huqua Press released The Oprah Effect which features a foreword by Ken Goldstein.  Planet illogica  Stephen Nemeth, Ken Goldstein, Tonny Sorensen and Bob Johnson (the principals of Planet illogica) at the Taschen Vanity Fair-Planet illogica kick-off, December 2009 Ken Goldstein co-founded Planet illogica, an agency and an online creative community for artists and art organizations. The site launched in beta July 2009 with the help of the American Film Institute‚Äôs Digital Content Lab. During his tenure with Planet illogica Goldstein was the CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) and oversaw all marketing, promotion and branding efforts. Examples of Planet illogica's marketing support of its artists in residence include their South by Southwest art exhibit of American contemporary artist Ron English‚Äôs Historic KISS art and other music-related prints, its online sale and promotion of custom limited edition apparel from English‚Äôs Popaganda collection, the brokering of Ron English art into the video game, inFamous on the PS3 and co-Producing Ron's 2010 retrospect, Status Factory. Another project was Infiltrate, an art installation touring the University of Utah, George Washington University, and the University of Florida, among other campuses., that Planet illogica produced for Disney Nature and Participant Media, as an educational and promotional vehicle for the film, Oceans. Planet illogica's roots were established in the Artists in Residence (AiR) program, also co-founded by Ken Goldstein and Tonny Sorensen, and incubated within the Von Dutch company. The inaugural AiR event was held at Von Dutch headquarters in Los Angeles, CA on September 27, 2007, and was a launch event for the mixed martial arts comic book JFH: Justice For Hire, created by the first AiR-sponsored artist, Jan Lucanus, who later became the first Planet illogica artist. \\"Justice-For-Hire Presents Fight Night at the Von Dutch\\" drew a crowd of 1,100 spectators as they were presented with martial arts demonstrations and exhibition fights from Jan and his \\"JFH\\" fight team members, including champion fighters Maximillion Chen, Ahmed Best, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Master John Machado, along with Jan's father, veteran comic book writer and Tai Chi Chuan Master Jan C. Childress. Other performances included an Oprah Winfrey-sponsored choir and acrobatics from Cirque du Soleil troop, REALIS. Celebrities in attendance included Seth Green, Lea Thompson, as well as a slew of martial arts masters from across California. Planet illogica also developed and produced multi-media projects including movies, television shows, books and albums.

The business currently operates from King Street, Hereford with a physical premises that contains a number of demonstration rooms, as well as a showroom.  History  HifiGear began in 2003 under the name of 'Gloucester Hifi', initially by Phil Glazzard who continues to own and direct the business today. The original store consisted of a small 70sqm lock- up shop in Eastgate Street, Gloucester, with only a limited range of brands available for purchase. A year later, an e-commerce arm was added to the business titled 'HifiGear'. The online store proved to be a success. By 2005, Gloucester Hifi relocated its shop premises to a larger unit in Three Cocks Lane, Gloucester. This additional space allowed for the introduction of more prominent brands to the company's catalogue. As the e-commerce arm of business continued to grow, the physical store-front changed the name from Gloucester Hifi to HifiGear and added two additional sales staff members. In 2009 the business moved again, to a far more prominent location with a larger premises of 300sqm. This building was located at Westgate Retail Park, Gloucester and featured two spacious demonstration rooms, car parking facilities and appropriate warehousing. In April 2012, HifiGear relocated once more to Rotherwas, in the rural city of Hereford. This move allowed the company to focus more time and resources in improving the eCommerce aspect even further, and during this time a new and more enhanced website was implemented, as well as a number of additional features, promotions and more descriptive product listings. The Rotherwas showroom was located a short drive from the Hereford city centre, which gave it a 'destination store' status. The move saw great improvements to both online business, and higher-value in-store custom. On March 2, 2015, HifiGear relocated again, this time to King Street, Hereford, which enabled the company to connect with and assist the people of Herefordshire in a more central location. The new premises is in direct view of Hereford's beautiful cathedral, and is easily recognisable by the neat orange and white 'HifiGear' sign, glowing over a brushed aluminium front, designed to reflect the clean aesthetic of the website. The King Street store showcases a number of models from highly regarded hifi brands, including Bowers & Wilkins, Naim Audio, KEF, Sonos, Ruark Audio, Loewe televisions, Pro- Ject Turntables, and much more, with demonstration capabilities in place for customers who wish to audition or compare products.  Recent activity  In March 2015, the company moved headquarters from Rotherwas, Hereford to the more central location of King Street, Hereford. A running series of posts added to the company's official blog followed the various stages the move.http://www.hifigear.co.uk/blog/category/shop-move-2015/  Product Range  Hifi Gear product range encompasses hifi audio separates, home cinema separates, loudspeakers, cables, portable music player accessories, and matching hifi and AV furniture.

The biomarkers can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a very early stage, but they also provide objective and reliable measures of disease progress. It is imperative to diagnose AD disease as soon as possible, because neuropathologic changes of AD precede the symptoms by years. It is well known that beta amyloid (AŒ≤) is a good indicator of AD disease, which has facilitated doctors to accurately pre- diagnose cases of AD disease. When AŒ≤ peptide is released by proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, some AŒ≤ peptides that are solubilized are detected in CSF and blood plasma which makes AB peptides a promising candidate for biological markers. It has been shown that the beta-amyloid biomarker shows 80% or above sensitivity and specificity, in distinguishing AD from dementia. It is believed that beta-amyloid as a biomarker will provide a future for diagnosis of AD and eventually treatment of AD. Amyloid beta AŒ≤ is composed of a family of peptides produced by proteolytic cleavage of the type I transmembrane spanning glycoprotein amyloid precursor protein (APP). Senile plaque AŒ≤ protein species ends in residue 40 or 42, but it is suspected that AŒ≤42 form is crucial in the pathogenesis of AD. Although AŒ≤42 makes up less than 10% of total AŒ≤, it aggregates at much faster rates than AŒ≤40. AŒ≤42 is the initial and major component of senile plaque deposits. While the most prevalent hypothesis for mechanisms of AŒ≤-mediated \\"neurotoxicity\\" is structural damage to the synapse, various mechanisms such as oxidative stress, altered calcium homeostasis, induction of apoptosis, structural damage, chronic inflammation and neuronal formation of amyloid has been proposed. Observation of AB42/AB40 ratio has been a promising biomarker for AD. However, as AB42 fails to be a reliable biomarker in plasma, attention was drawn for alternative biomarkers. Current biomarkers BACE1 Various enzymatic digestion including Œ≤- and Œ≥- secretase will cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) into various types of amyloid Œ≤ protein. Most Œ≤-secretase activity originates from an integral membrane aspartyle protease encoded by the Œ≤-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 gene (BACE1). Dr. Zetterberg and his team used a sensitive and specific BACE1 assay to assess CSF BACE1 activity in AD. It was found that those with AD showed increased BACE1 expression and enzymatic activity. It was concluded that elevated BACE 1 activity may contribute to the amyloidgenic process in Alzheimer's disease. CSF BACE1 activity could be a potential candidate biomarker to monitor amyloidogenic APP metabolism in the CNS. Soluble AŒ≤ precursor protein (sAPP) APP is an integral membrane protein whose proteolysis generates beta amyloid ranging from 39- to 42- amino acid peptide. Although the biological function of APP are not known, it has been hypothesized that APP may play a role during neuroregeneration, and regulation of neural activity, connectivity, plasticity, and memory. Recent research has shown that large soluble APP (sAPP) that are present in CSF may serve as a novel potential biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. In a article published in Nature, a group led by Lewczuk performed a test to observe the performance of a soluble form of APP Œ± and Œ≤. A significant increase in sAPP Œ± and sAPP Œ≤ was found in patients with AD as compared to normal subjects. However, the CSF level of Œ±-sAPP and Œ≤-sAPP was found to be contradictory. Although many researchers have found that the CSF level of Œ± sAPP increases in AD patients, some report that there is no significant change, while Lannfelt argues that there is a slight decrease. Therefore, more studies are needed in order to confirm the validity of sAPP as a biological marker for AD. Autoantibodies Researchers at Indiana University found that titres of anti-beta-amyloid antibodies in cerebral spinal fluid was lower in AD patients compared to healthy patients.  Novel approach  Recent studies primarily focus on use of an autoantibody, not only for biological markers but for future treatment. However, there are various arguments whether an autoantibody method provides a reliable biomarker. A number of reports show that patients with AD have lower levels of serum anti-AB antibodies than healthy individuals, and others have argued that the level of anti-AB antibody may be higher in AD. In order to avoid provide solution for discrepancy in the existing data, Dr. Gustaw came up with novel method of dissociation sample.  Theory  In biological fluids, antibodies and antigens are in a state of dynamic equilibrium between bound and unbound forms that is concentration- dependent. As antigen masks the antibody, it obstructs accurate measurement of antibody-antigen detection. Dr. Gustow discovered a novel way to enhance antibody-antigen detection. Using a dissociation buffer (1.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2M glycine HCl pH2/5), he dissociated antigen-antibody complexes. In dissociated samples, unbound antigen-antibody complexes reveal increased disease state compared to non-diseased state.  Method  * Prepare dissociation buffer: 1.4% bovine serum albumin + 0.2M glycine-HCL, pH2.5 * Incubate AB42 for 20 minutes * Dissolve AB42 in 500 uL dissociation buffer in Microcon centrifugal device * Incubate at for 20 minutes * Centrifuge for 20 minutes at 16,000 G at * Invert filter and spin for 3 minutes at 2000 G * Bring the sample back to a neutral pH with 15-2uL 2.5M Tris pH9 * Add ELISA buffer (1.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate buffered saline) * Perform ELISA analysis.  Result  The white block represents non-dissociation data. The black block represents dissociation data. As the ELISA result shows, the detection of antibody is blocked by addition of beta- amyloid when the experiment was performed without dissociation. Following dissociation, the level of antibody detected increased to a level nearly control to level of control. He used the same methodology in vivo to examine sera collected from AD patients. The results, surprisingly, demonstrated a significant increase in antibody titer. It contradicts the majority of studies arguing that the amyloid-beta antibody decreases in AD patients. The non- dissociated sample follows the widespread theory that amyloid-beta decreases in AD patients. However, he had already proven that a non-dissociated sample fails to bring out a valid result. The dissociated sample results show significant increases in AD patients, which contradicts the majority of previous studies.  Contribution  Currently, there are many biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, most of them do not provide consistent data results. The novel approach (autoantibody) not only explained the discrepancy of results in previous studies of autoantibody, but provided a new standard as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. Compared to other biomarkers which have variable measurements on diagnosis of AD, the new autoantibody approach accurately measures AŒ≤ level with high sensitivity, and proved itself to be an excellent biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. It is believed that the new technology will provide not only future early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease but also possible therapy for Alzheimer's disease. An open international study group (ND.Neuromark.net) has been constituted for arranging scientific information and developing a rational guide for implementing biomarkers into routine practice.

He was born into the Anglican church, converted to Catholicism in the early 1930s, and returned to the Church of England in the mid-1950s. He is the author of \\"Blake: a Psychological Study.\\" Biography Witcutt was the son of a Staffordshire merchant tailor. He studied law at the University of Birmingham, England, and around 1928 his interest in G. K. Chesterton's anti-industrial theory of Distributism led him to become a prominent contributor to Chesterton's G. K.'s Weekly publication, where he was a strong critic of the theory of the Leisure State. His interest in Distributism continued into the 1930s, as evidence by his article \\"William Morris: distributist\\" in American Review in 1934 (II, pp. 311‚Äì15), and he appears to have been a Distributist at least until around the outbreak of war in 1939. His 46-page pamphlet The Dying Lands: a fifty years' plan for the distressed areas appeared under the imprint of the Distributist League of London in 1937, and offered a radical agrarian solution to the problem of mass unemployment. This line of thought eventually led him into the Roman Catholic church, and to convert to Catholicism in the early 1930s. He obtained a dispensation to void the usual two-year probationary period, immediately undertaking a seven-year seminary training at New Oscott to become a Catholic priest. On graduating he was sent to serve in a slum parish in nearby Birmingham. He told in his spiritual autobiography, Return to Reality (1954), of how his lecture on The Reformation and the corrupt nature of many medieval Catholic priests inadvertently led to his being 'banished' to serve in the most remote parts of the diocese. He became a parish priest in Leek, North Staffordshire, and, during the Second World War he also served at St. Anne's, Wappenbury, Warwickshire. He eventually converted back to the Church of England. His re-conversion merited an article in Time magazine (\\"To Rome & Return\\", 4 July 1955). He became a high-church Anglican curate in the working class area of East Ham, London, and later on served as the Rector of Foulness Island a short while after it had been badly affected by the great North Sea Flood. Works During the war Witcutt wrote up and published his notes on folklore in the fringe areas of the West Midlands, including: *\\"Notes on Staffordshire Folklore\\" (Folklore, Vol. 53, No. 2, June 1942, pp. 126‚Äì27); *\\"The Horsley Legend\\" (Folklore, Vol. 55, No. 2, June 1944, pp. 73‚Äì75); *\\"The Black Dog\\" (Folklore, Vol. 53, 1942, p. 167) During the war he encountered Ukrainian refugees, and this resulted in the scholarly article \\"Mortuary Beliefs and Practices Among the Galician Ukrainians\\", published in Folklore (Vol.57. No. 2., June 1946). Witcutt undertook one of the first applications of the theories of Jung to visionary English literature. His book Blake, a psychological study examined the works of William Blake via the theory of Jungian archetypes. Witcutt corresponded with Jung on the matter. Other works by Witcutt include: *Catholic Thought And Modern Psychology; *Child in Paradise (a study of the role of fantasy in childhood); *an early critical study of D. H. Lawrence, The Cult of D.H.

Some versions of the device can provide right heart support during other forms of mechanical circulatory support including ECMO and Centrimag. The device is approved for use in high- risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and cardiogenic shock following heart attack or open heart surgery. It is placed through a peripheral artery, from which it pumps blood to the left or right heart via the ascending aorta or pulmonary artery, respectively. The Impella technology was acquired by Abiomed in 2005.https://www.medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com/abiomed-cracked- big-100/ As of March 2019, the Impella series included the Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0/LD, Impella CP and Impella RP.http://www.abiomed.com/impellahttps://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/deviceapprovalsandclearances/recently- approveddevices/ucm598801.htmhttps://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=247589  Medical uses  The Impella device is a simple solution to a very complex problem. Used alone or in tandem sets it utilizes the concept of magnetic levitation to reduce moving parts to an absolute minimum thus reducing anticoagulation requirements. Cardiogenic shock has been historically addressed by many devices, most notably the Intra Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP). The technology deployed by the Impella device similarly alters the fundamental characteristics of the human circulatory system. As the propeller is accelerated to give respite to an acutely injured myocardium the circulatory system transitions from a pulsatile mechanism to continuous flow. Cellular response to cardiogenic shock is poorly described by either method (counterpulsation or continuous flow). Control of directional flow of the device (magnetic vectors) is under investigation in pursuit of addressing right versus left sided heart failure. Transseptal intervention in addressing physiologic mismatch in perfusion between left and right sided heart failure is in experimental status. Impella provides results similar to venoarterial extracorporeal life support and TandemHeart. The Impella pump is recommended in the following practice guidelines: * 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Guideline for the Management of Patients With Non‚ÄìST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes * 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACCF)/AHA Guidelines for the Management of ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction * 2013 ACCF/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure * 2013 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for Mechanical Circulatory Support * 2012 AHA Scientific Statement: Use of Mechanical Circulatory Support * 2011 ACCF/AHA/Society for Coronary Angiography Interventions (SCAI) Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention  Technology  Impella heart pumps are percutaneous microaxial pumps that act as mechanical circulatory support devices in patients in need of hemodynamic support. The pumps are mounted on support catheters and typically inserted through the femoral artery, although axillary and subclavian artery approaches are not uncommon.  Technology  The Impella Device is a generational extension of the Intra aortic balloon pump (IABP) in addressing cardiogenic shock. Tech has allowed a single moving piece floated by magnetically steered mechanisms to deploy an \\"Archimedes Pump\\" just north of the Aortic Valve that purports to reduce both preload and afterload. The same tech can apparently also be deployed just above the pulmonary (pulmonic) valve as a gate on right sided heart failure.  Left- sided support  Designed to provide hemodynamic support when the patient's heart is unable to produce sufficient cardiac output, Impella heart pumps can supply one to five liters per minute of blood flow. The physiological consequences of left-sided support are threefold. First, it unloads the left ventricle by reducing left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, thereby decreasing ventricular wall stress, work, and myocardial oxygen demand. Second, it increases mean arterial pressure, diastolic pressure, and cardiac output, improving cardiac power output and cardiac index. The combined effects on wall stress and perfusion pressure (especially diastolic pressure) augment coronary perfusion. Lastly, augmented cardiac output and forward flow from the left ventricle decreases pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and reduces right ventricular afterload. Approval In June 2008, the Impella 2.5 heart pump received FDA 510(k) clearance for partial circulatory support for periods of up to six hours during cardiac procedures not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. In March 2015, it received FDA premarket approval for elective and urgent high-risk percutaneous intervention procedures. In December 2016, the premarket approval was expanded to include the Impella CP heart pump. In April 2009, the Impella 5.0 and Impella LD heart pumps received 510(k) clearance for circulatory support for periods of up to six hours during cardiac procedures not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. In July 2010, the automated Impella controller received FDA 510(k) clearance for use by trained healthcare professionals in healthcare facilities and medical transport. In January 2015, the Impella RP was granted a humanitarian device exemption to provide circulatory assistance for patients with right heart failure. In February 2018, the FDA approved the sale of the Impella ventricular support systems.

Within its family, it belongs to the subfamily Gracillariinae. It is apparently endemic to Fatu Hiva and Hiva Oa in the Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia. It is very similar (and presumably closely related) to C. deltanthes. The species does not seem to be common, and no females appear to have been encountered yet.Clarke (1986) Description C. insidia is a small moth, with a wingspan of about 12 mm (c.0.5 in) and an overall reddish coloration; males and females look alike externally. The head and thorax are light brownish purple, except for the facial area which is a buff color. The labial palps are the same color on the outside and on the underside of the third segment; otherwise, they are light buff. The antennae are grey, though the scape is the same purplish color as most of the head and thorax. The abdomen is reddish above, and a glossy buff on the underside. The legs are also light brownish purple, except for the midleg tarsi and the hindleg femur which are buff, shading to grey towards the tip in the former case. The forewing color is mainly the same brownish-purple as the dominant body color; its bright yellow markings resemble those of C. deltanthes but are less extensive. From the wing base, an oblique narrow triangle extends to the wing's trailing edge. Just before the center of the leading edge, a narrow band runs across the wing to the trailing edge, where it tapers to a point. A spot of the same yellow color is located near the tornus. The wings have a hairy fringe, which is the same as the background color in the forewings, except at the wingtip and the adjacent outer edge, where it is buff. The hindwings are reddish-brown, with the fringe of the same color. The female genitals are still unknown. In the male, the clasper's harpe is simple, slim at the base but widening towards the broadly truncated cucullus with its bluntly pointed upper end; the uncus is likewise bluntly pointed. The vinculum is long and triangular; the tegumen is also long (twice as long as wide) and moderately sclerotized (hardened). The anellus is comparatively little sclerotized, a mere little plate of uneven shape. The long aedeagus is straight, slim and ends in a point; the vesica is unarmed. Ecology Only a handful of these moths - all males as it seems - have even been found. The holotype USNM 100840 was collected on March 1, 1968, on Mount Feani, Hiva Oa, at an altitude of about 750 m (2500 ft) ASL (presumably between Atuona and the summit of Temetiu), and further specimens were collected on southern Fatu Hiva at a similar altitude; the species thus seems to live mainly in the uplands. The larval foodplant(s) are unknown; in its habitat, native plants such as Bidens henryi, Cheirodendron bastardianum, Pandanus, East Polynesian blueberry (Vaccinium cereum) and lichens and mosses are still plentiful.

Her passion for the creative arts, costume history, textiles and ancient techniques of tailoring, accompanied by her love for artisan craftmanship has permitted Sautter to become known as a distinguished Italian celebrity. In addition to haute couture, Sautter plans and organizes private events worldwide with her distinguished style, the most notable of which is Il Ballo del Doge, the most exclusive luxury event of the Carnival of Venice.\\"Crisis? It's party time at Venice Carnival\\", Reuters, 24 February 2009, retrieved 29 July 2011 Biography After studying foreign languages and literature at the Ca 'Foscari University of Venice, Sautter moved to New York City where she started working in the fashion industry. Having returned to Venice, she became the managing director of the Italian branch of Venezia Mode, a leading company in the distribution of products bearing the Made in Italy hallmark to the United States. Subsequently, she becomes an entrepreneur by starting her own workshop and founding Antonia Sautter Creations & Events, in which she develops her unique concepts of luxury products and haute couture creations. In 1994, she created Il Ballo del Doge, the international gala event of the Venice Carnival, described by Vanity Fair as \\"the most lavish, exclusive, and coveted social event of the world\\". In 1999, she was chosen by Stanley Kubrick to create of part of the masks used in his last film, Eyes Wide Shut. While her costumes are sought-after particularly during the Carnival period, her works have also been used in theatrical and film productions, most notably in Jean-Louis Guillermou's Antonio Vivaldi, un Prince √† Venise (France, 2006) starring Michel Serrault and Stefano Dionisi. Il Ballo del Doge Sautter with artists from Il Ballo del Doge Venice IIl Ballo del Doge is an annual ball organized by Sautter since 1994 during Venice‚Äôs Carnival in Palazzo Pisani Moretta on the Grand Canal, a beautiful 16th century palace. The concept of the ball developed in a very original manner after a chance meeting between Sautter and Terry Jones, a founding member of the Monty Python team. Jones was in Venice preparing a historical documentary for the BBC on the Crusades. Sautter was in charge of logistics, costumes and set designs for the shoot. From her involvement in this venture, the idea of recreating the magical elegance of bygone ages developed in her mind and from there the Ballo del Doge began to take shape. It is considered \\"the main event of the Venetian Carnival season\\". Each year the event develops along a different theme that is conceived by Sautter‚Äôs artistic vision; in 2016 the theme was \\"The Secret Gardens of Dreams\\". The ball dress code is very strict. Traditional evening wear is strictly forbidden. Accesses may only wear periode costumes that guests can fit at the Atelier Antonia Sautter. The event is normally attended by the international jet set, VIPs and aristocrats from the world over who delight in wearing costumes created by the designer and made available for the event. Each costume is unique, made following age old skills of Italian craftsmanship. Antonia Sautter fashion collection in Venice Fashion creation AS Creations & Events is the umbrella name covering all of Sautter‚Äôs business activities, from her fashion line Fashion Venetia and her line of home furnishings to the organisation of corporate events and private parties for cultural organisations, international companies, as well as public and private individuals. Boutiques In three boutiques situated just behind Piazza San Marco (Saint Mark's Square) in Venice, Sautter sells her fashion creations ‚Äì Fashion Venetia, hand dyed and hand printed silk velvet fabrics, shoes and bags, and home furnishings all following traditional Venetian artisan methods. The boutiques also sell masks (traditional Venetian masks), bronzes, lost wax sculptures, carousels, music boxes and marionettes.

Opened in 1860, it is a junction of five lines, to Venice, Trieste, Tarvisio, Cervignano and Cividale, respectively. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia, √ñBB and Ferrovie Udine- Cividale. Location Udine railway station is situated in Viale Europa Unita, at the southern edge of the city centre. History The station commenced operations on , upon the inauguration of the Cormons‚ÄìUdine section of the Venice‚ÄìUdine railway. Only a few months later, on 3 October 1860, it also became the terminus of the Udine‚ÄìTrieste railway, in conjunction with the opening of the Cormons‚ÄìUdine section of that line. Under the management of Centostazioni, the passenger building underwent a restoration and renovation completed in 2005. The construction work focused on the modernization of the main hall, the construction of a new ticket office and the new information centre. In addition, some spaces were created for commercial use. Features regional train at Udine, 1997. The station has a large passenger building that houses many services, including ticketing, two newsagents, bars, a bank, a chapel, a pharmacy, the shops, the Eurostar Club and the headquarters of the Railway Police. In addition, there are offices of Trenitalia and the station manager. At one time the station was also the home of a military command. The station yard is equipped with 7 tracks for passenger service (numbered 1 to 8), plus a few tracks for the exclusive use of freight handling, shunting, stabling and storage, including track number 2 which has no platform. Up to 1 December 2008, the station was equipped with a locomotive shed and workshops. Passenger and train movements The movement of passengers at the station is about 7.6 million people a year, which means that the station is the busiest in Friuli-Venezia Giulia in terms of numbers of passengers. In the station, there are all types of trains for different destinations. Directly outside the station, in the square, are bus stops for all bus routes to Udine. A few hundred metres away is the bus station, which is a terminus for suburban services. In front of the station is a taxi stand.

In 1791 and from 1794 to 1801, he was named by the Governors to play for the clergy of St. Paul's Cathedral, at the society's annual May benefits concert. After his father's death in 1805, he and his brother Christopher continued the oratorios, and by 1817 he was a violoncellist in a band at the King's Theatre. In the latter part of his life he was for some seasons manager of the Tivoli Gardens at Margate, where he died on 29 August 1843. During his later years, before his death in 1843, Charles became quite weak in health, which may have been due to the 19 years he spent in prison over debt.

The base colour of the wings is brown with gold and greenish scales. Yellow spots are found on the apex of the forewing. Three black stripes of scales are found on the fringes of the hindwing. The body is brown and the head greenish. Adults emerge in July and August and are active until winter. They then overwinter until spring to mate. The larvae feed on Acer negundo. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The first instar larvae make a narrow, linear mine along the underside of the leaflet. The mine crosses to the upperside to form a white spot until emerging. Final instars form a cone from the distal portion of the leaf and pupate inside.

Waka originated within the near-equatorial trough in mid-December 2001, although the system remained disorganized for more than a week. The storm gradually matured and attained tropical cyclone status on December 29. Subsequently, Waka underwent rapid intensification in which it attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone (Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale) on December 31, with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Shortly thereafter, it passed directly over Vava ªu, Tonga, resulting in widespread damage. By January 1, 2002, the cyclone began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. The remnants of Waka persisted for several more days and were last observed near the Southern Ocean on January 6. Although the storm affected several countries along its path, Waka left the most significant losses in Tonga, where it killed one person and wrought 104.2 million pa ªanga ($51.3 million USD) in damage. Hundreds of structures, including 200 in the island's largest city, and much of the nation's agriculture were destroyed. Winds in excess of 185 km/h (115 mph) battered Vava'u, defoliating nearly every tree on the island. In addition to infrastructural and public losses, the environment was also severely affected; a native species of bat lost roughly 80% of its population due to the lack of fruit. Following the storm, Tonga requested international aid to cope with the scale of damage. Due to the severity of damage, the name Waka was later retired and replaced with Wiki. According to a study by Janet Franklin et al., storms similar in intensity to Waka, on average, strike Tonga once every 33 years. Meteorological history In mid- December 2001, at the end of a Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation pulse, twin equatorial monsoonal troughs developed in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Although warm sea surface temperatures of in the region favored development of a tropical cyclone, the southern trough developed substantially slower than the northern one. On December 19, the southern component was classified as Tropical Depression 03F by the Fiji Meteorological Service; at this time the depression was situated just east of the Solomon Islands. The northern component eventually developed into Typhoon Faxai, an extremely powerful Category 5 equivalent cyclone. Unlike Faxai, the precursor to Cyclone Waka developed slowly, mainly because of moderate wind shear in the region. Moving southeastward, the system gradually became more organized. On two occasions, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert; however, the agency later canceled them both times. By December 27, the depression had entered a region of lesser shear, favoring significant development of the system. The following day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07P, when the storm was situated roughly northwest of Pago Pago, American Samoa. Tracking towards the southwest in response to a mid-level ridge to the southeast, the depression quickly intensified, attaining gale-force winds on December 29. Upon doing so, it was upgraded to a tropical cyclone and given the name Waka. Shortly thereafter, the storm underwent rapid intensification; roughly 24 hours after being named, Waka attained sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). During December 30, the center of the storm brushed Wallis Island before turning towards the southeast and accelerating due to an approaching trough from the northwest. Continuing to intensify, Waka passed directly over Niuafo'ou on December 31 with winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Later that day, the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with ten-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 930 mbar (hPa; 27.46 inHg). The JTWC assessed the storm to have attained similar one-minute sustained winds upon peaking; however, this was due to discrepancies between the two warning centers. At this time, Waka displayed a well-defined, circular eye roughly in diameter. Shortly after attaining its peak intensity, the center of Waka passed over Vava'u. Continuing into the new year, Waka gradually weakened on January 1, 2002 as it entered a less favorable region for tropical cyclones. As a result, wind shear displaced convection from the center and its eyewall broke apart. Moving over decreasing sea surface temperatures, Waka began to undergo an extratropical transition, which it completed on January 2. Tracking southeastward, the remnant cyclone briefly slowed over open waters before again accelerating. Over the following few days, the system gradually weakened, with sustained winds decreasing below gale-force by January 5. The storm was last noted on January 6 near the Southern Ocean, about north- northwest of Antarctica, at which time it had a pressure of 972 mbar (hPa; 28.7 inHg). Preparations and impact Tonga On December 30, just a day before Waka passed through Tonga, warnings were issued for numerous islands, including parts of Fiji and Samoa. Forecasts showed the storm passing directly over the low-lying Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa as a Category 3 cyclone. Owing to warnings from local media, all New Year's Eve celebrations were canceled as residents and tourists boarded up their homes. All airports in the region were shut down and ferry service was suspended. Many residents on the small island of Niuafo'ou, about 35 km2 (13.5 mi2) in size, evacuated to other islands prior to Waka's arrival. Infrared satellite image of Cyclone Waka passing directly over Vava'u on December 31 When the storm was moving through the islands of Tonga at peak strength, a few islands recorded hurricane-force winds; the city of Neiafu measured the strongest winds, peaking at 185 km/h (115 mph). In the southern islands, wind gusts up to 250 km/h (155 mph) affected isolated areas. In the Ha ªapai islands, sustained winds reached 100 km/h (65 mph) and gusted to 140 km/h (85 mph). Heavy rains also fell during Waka's passage, amounting to over in Ha ªapai. Initial reports from Nuku ªalofa on December 31 indicated severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses. Following the passage of Waka, communication with Niuas and Vava'u were lost. According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly every tree. Surveys by the Red Cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, yams and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest brought on by the storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs. In one instance, a yacht was brought onshore by the surge and crashed into a restaurant, destroying both. According to damage surveys, 13 of the country's islands sustained damage; 470 homes and 6 schools were destroyed and hundreds more damaged. Damage throughout Tonga amounted to 104.2 million pa ªanga ($51.3 million USD). In addition to infrastructural and public damage, the environment sustained catastrophic losses on Tonga. The Insular Flying Fox (Pteropus tonganus), a native species of bat, suffered great losses from Waka. Compared to pre-cyclone population levels, 79.8% (¬±9.9%) of the species was killed across six islands. This was due to widespread destruction of their natural food source, which decreased by 85% (¬±11.8%) following Waka. Trees across Vava'u were completely defoliated, although only 6.6% were killed, leaving no food for the bats. The greatest decline in bats was on Utula'aina Island at 95.7%; A'a Island sustained a complete loss of food-bearing plants. Six months after the storm, the bat population in Vava'u was still only 20% of the pre-storm level. Elsewhere During the cyclone's formative stages, it brought significant winds and swells to Tokelau, resulting in localized flooding and crop damage. American Samoa also experienced heavy rains, amounting to , and gusts up to . The winds downed a few trees and caused minor crop damage, with losses amounting to US$120,000. Large swells affected the island for roughly a week as the storm developed and moved away from the region. Cyclone Waka also affected Wallis and Futuna, prompting tropical cyclone watches and warnings from December 28 to 31, and later impacted Niue, prompting warnings there from December 30 to January 1. On Wallis Island, one home was destroyed and 50% of the banana crop was lost. A maximum of of rain fell in Hihifo during the passage of Waka. A wind gust of and swells up to were recorded in Wallis. Niue received more significant damage, experiencing a storm surge of up to and sea spray up to inland. Numerous fallen trees and power lines blocked roads and left southern areas of the island without power for roughly six hours. Damage in Niue amounted to US$10,000. After moving through the Tongan islands, the remnants of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 people out of the water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards. Aftermath Enlarged track of Cyclone Waka between December 29 and January 1 depicting the storm's path in relation to several South Pacific islands. Within a day of Cyclone Waka's passage in Tonga, the Government of New Zealand deployed an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent in accordance with the FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assets from one country would be used in relief operations. On January 2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January 7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process. On January 12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery. Further funds came from the United States Agency for International Development, which offered US$25,000 by mid- January. The French Polynesian assembly in Tahiti also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid. The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed to travel to the region for at least two weeks after Waka's passage. The Government of Tonga requested a total of US$39.2 million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by the World Health Organization. In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the United Methodist Committee on Relief to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm. About 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their homes by the Church World Service later that month. As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga. In May, US$5.85 million was approved for emergency funds by the World Bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.International Monetary Fund, p. 5 Vava'u suffered a tremendous decrease in agricultural exports due to Waka, dropping 86.5% from the previous year.Tonga Ministry of Agriculture, p. 172 Despite substantial agricultural losses, the sector ended up expanding roughly 2% by the end of 2002 and the overall economy grew by 2.9%.Commonwealth Secretariat, p. 20 Owing to the severity of damage wrought by the cyclone, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Waka following its using.

Palazzo Pisani Moretta is a palace situated along the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy (in the sestiere of San Polo) between Palazzo Tiepolo and Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza. History Built in the second half of the 15th Century by the Bembo family, the palace soon became the residence of a branch of the noble Pisani family (the Pisani Moretta branch). The palace was renovated, modified and extended over the following centuries, finally taking on its current aspect in the 18th Century. In fact many of the valuable interior decorations date back to the 18th Century. Past guests to the palace included important historic figures such as Tsar Paul I of Russia, Jos√©phine de Beauharnais and Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. Palazzo Pisani Moretta remained in the Pisani family until it died out in 1880 but the building is still owned privately. The interior rooms were decorated by Baroque artists such as Tiepolo, Jacopo Guarana, Gaspare Diziani and Giuseppe Angeli. The palace once housed, among other things, Paolo Veronese's monumental painting The Family of Darius before Alexander, which was viewed here by Goethe in 1786 (diary entry from October 8 of that year) and acquired by the National Gallery, London, in 1857, where it now hangs. The palace is said to have housed a ceiling painting called, The Chariots of Aurora by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini (1675-1741), which was restored and installed in the Library of George Vanderbilt's Biltmore House in Asheville, NC. It hosts an annual masquerade ball Il Ballo del Doge, held during the Carnival period. Description Details.

Biderman is considered one of the wave of literary oppositionists who were active in May 68 and attempted to redefine popular genres, exemplified in his Joseph Radkin Investigation series which combined social and political history in a mystery format. He also was the founding editor and publisher of several magazines ‚Äì Caf√© Magazine, where he wrote extensively on the social history of coffee and Visions of the City Magazine, an offshoot of The Visions of the City Project which looked at alternative constructs of the urban metropolis. Biderman was one of the founders of Black Apollo Press and edited its popular Rediscovered Victorians series. Biography Bob Biderman's father was the poet and political activist, A.E. Biderman and his mother, the visual artist, Fannie Kuller Biderman. He grew up in the American Midwestern city of Cincinnati, Ohio where his father was forced to go underground during the anti-communist purges of the 1950s.Under Three Flags: An Interview with Bob Biderman, Finley‚Äôs Book Reviews, September 2010 This experience provided the basis for several of Biderman's novels: Red Dreams,Interview with Bob Biderman, Otis Review, Otis College of Arts and Design Issue 2/ 2008 which viewed the brutalities of McCarthy's America through the eyes of a child and the first of his Radkin mysteries, Strange Inheritance.Strange Inheritance, Tribune Books, London, 11 July 1986 In 1954 Biderman's mother left Cincinnati, moving to Los Angeles in search of a more liberal environment in which to raise her children. After the repeal of the Smith Act in 1956, the family was reunited and subsequently moved to Houston, Texas where Biderman completed high school. In 1958 he began his undergraduate work at the University of Texas in Austin where he studied mathematics, transferring two years later to the University of California at Berkeley where he studied science with the idea of becoming a physician. In 1962 Biderman left the States for Europe, living first in Paris and then London; however in 1963 he was drafted into the military and was forced to return 'by any means'. As Biderman later wrote, 'I took the slowest route possible ‚Äì in this case a rusty freighter sailing out of Glasgow bound for San Francisco via the Panama Canal'.The Writer as Oppositionist, An Interview with Bob Biderman, Ozymandias Magazine, October 2010 While in the army he trained as a medic and subsequently worked as a medical technician assigned to the first US Army division destined for Vietnam ‚Äì though he, himself, remained stateside. His military experiences at the beginning of the Vietnam War became the basis for his debut novel, Letters to Nanette.Catch-22 redux, American Library Association, About Books, 15 June 1983 After his discharge from the army in 1965, Biderman returned to San Francisco where he worked at odd jobs, 'hanging out at the Caf√© Trieste with the remnants of the Beats', till going back to his studies at San Francisco State University, eventually gaining a degree in English literature. At university he became an activist in the anti- war movement and was a leading participant in the student strike of 1968. His experiences of May 68 became the basis for his novel, Koba.http://finleysbooks.com/biderman_interview.htm It was during that period he met Joy Magezis, also a leading student activist, whom he married in 1970. In 1971 he and Joy took a motorcycle tour of Europe, ending up in London where the couple lived in Rona Road, Camden and where their first child was born. They returned to San Francisco in 1972, settling in the city's Noe Valley district. In 1974 Biderman and his wife started a puppet theatre which toured America for the bicentennial, performing in numerous venues across the nation. The birth of their second child in 1977 ended this theatrical venture and in 1978 they set up an arts-in-education resource centre, located on the corner of San Francisco's 29th and Church streets. The resource centre's magazine, The Puppetry-in-Education News, gave Biderman his first experience in publishing and the success of that periodical led him to link up with Bruce Chesse whose publishing house ‚Äì Early Stages Press ‚Äì had been printing and distributing puppet related materials. Under Biderman's editorship, the press began to incorporate a wider range of work, eventually becoming the distribution arm of an author's cooperative ‚Äì The Contemporary Literature Project. Biderman's interest in writing, politics and cooperative publishing led him to become one of the original organisers of the nascent National Writers' Union (the contradictions of which he discussed in Strange Inheritance) and a vocal critic of the American culture industry. His address to the West Coast Writers' Conference in 1982 was widely circulated.A Brief History of Publishing In 1983, Biderman and his young family moved back to Britain, settling in Cambridge where he took up residence as a full-time writer. Struggling to find an outlet for his work, he was influenced by a friend and colleague, Gordon DeMarco, to develop a more popular form of political fiction.Thrillers with America's hidden history, The Guardian, London, 14 October 1995 DeMarco, himself, was finding limited success as a political mystery writer and had been taken on by Pluto Press as one of the lead authors for their 'New Crime' series. DeMarco had introduced Biderman to Pete Ayrton, who at the time was editing this list and in 1984, Pluto Press published Strange Inheritance, the first of what was to become the Joseph Radkin Investigations series. His second mystery, Koba, set in San Francisco and peopled with the survivors of May 68, was shortlisted for the Pluto Prize but remained unpublished for several years as Pluto was sold and restructured during the economic downturn of the mid 1980s. In 1986 the London-based publishing house, Victor Gollancz, published the next in the Radkin series, Genesis Files (which was listed by the Guardian as one of the top ten crime novels of the year)The Best of All Worlds, Guardian Books, The Guardian, London 25 November 1988 and then Koba as part of their revamped yellow jacket mysteries. In 1988, Biderman, now living in Toulouse, France, completed Judgement of Death, the third in the Radkin series. After Toulouse. Biderman returned to the States where he and his family took up residence in Portland, Oregon as cheap housing there became a magnet for struggling artists no longer able to afford San Francisco. DeMarco, who was living in Portland at the time, introduced them to the lively writers' circles that had sprung up in the city. It was in Portland that Biderman wrote the final two books in the Radkin series ‚Äì Paper Cuts, concerning the clear-cutting of the great redwood forests and Mayan Strawberries, about the Mixtec Indians who travelled north from Guatemala to work the Oregon agricultural harvest.Joseph Radkin Investigations Series Catalogue By 1990, Biderman and his family had decided to go back to England. As Biderman explained it, their return to the United States had been 'sort of a last chance saloon ‚Äì an attempt to reconnect with our American roots before finally succumbing to the realisation that we were, for better or worse, expatriates.' Settling once again in Cambridge, while taking up a post as lecturer at a further education college in London, he began researching the history of coffee and cafes, 'intrigued by the way the English class system had been circumvented in the 18th century by the development of the coffee house which provided a meeting ground for both prince and pauper.' In 1994 he started Caf√© Magazine which became one of the pioneer publications on the World Wide Web.Caf√© Magazine Website In 1996, along with David Kelley, a fellow at Trinity College, he began Black Apollo Press 'as a way of connecting to the bohemian subculture ‚Äì hoping to create a Rive Gauche on the River Cam'. These same years saw Biderman finish the first part of his Social History of Coffee and complete Red Dreams, his semi-autobiographical account of growing up in McCarthy's America. As the 20th century came to a close, Biderman focused more on his interest in urban anthropology. Along with his son, Kevin Biderman and French colleagues, Yann Perreau and Marc Hatzfield, he helped develop the Visions of the City Project which sought to explore the emergence of new urban constructs as places of connection, refuge and regeneration.Visions of the City Project Website This project evolved into Visions of the City Magazine which Biderman edited. In the succeeding years, Biderman focused much of his time on researching 19th century immigration patterns into London from Eastern Europe and the process of assimilation that followed. This research eventually became an exploration of his own Jewish roots and resulted in his last novel ‚Äì Eight Weeks in the Summer of Victoria's Jubilee: The Queen, the Jews and a Murder.

They cut through the steel door using an oxy torch ‚Äì somehow avoiding igniting the highly flammable nitrate film inside ‚Äì and loaded a truck with the contents to take away for disposal.Edmondson and Pike 1982, p. 38. An office worker saw the truck drive by, loaded with film cans, gave chase in his car, and rescued the film, which included the first eight of nine reels of The Flying Doctor. Two years later, the BFI National Film Archive in London found a copy of the shortened, re-edited British release of the film, also eight reels long, in the possession of a large film company. Despite this print having been \\"totally rearranged\\", the last reel was found to take up exactly where the Australian one left off. References Notes Citations Bibliography * Beck, Simon D.

Plot summary In Eye of the Serpent, the player characters are captured by a roc and brought to its nest; after escaping, they must find their way down the mountain and through a dangerous valley to return to civilization. If the scenario is played as a one-on-one scenario, the player character is accompanied by three non-player characters. Publication history UK5 Eye of the Serpent was written by Graeme Morris, with art by Tim Sell and was published by TSR in 1984 as a 32-page booklet with an outer folder. It is part of the UK-series of modules, written by British authors and developed by TSR's UK division. Reception Chris Hunter reviewed the module for Imagine magazine, giving it a mixed review. Hunter described the scenario as climbing down a \\"rather artificial looking\\" mountain side. This constitutes the main part of the adventure and involves various encounters reached via routes, access to which depends on the type of player character chosen. While this approach tests the special abilities of the selected type of character, it has the \\"unfortunate side effect\\" that there is virtually only one way to go, i.e. there is very little choice of direction for the player(s). Hunter also noted an \\"excessive use\\" of monsters from the Monster Manual II. He concluded that the module was based on a novel idea and that it had \\"a lot of work\\" put into it, but that it ultimately \\"doesn't quite come off\\".

(WSRR) is a service registry for use in a Service-oriented architecture. It runs as a Java Enterprise Application on IBM WebSphere Application Server. It provides functionality to store and retrieve service-metadata. WSDL, XSD, SCA Modules and Policy documents can be loaded and parsed into separate entities. For example, with a WSDL document, separate entities are created for service, binding, portType etc. XML and binary documents can be loaded as single entities. These entities can then be decorated with additional data in the form of properties, classifications and relationships. Classification systems defined in OWL are supported. Custom object types can be modelled in OWL such as service contracts, SLAs and SLDs. Entities with the registry can be managed using life cycles defined in SACL in order to provide service governance. The life cycle can track the state of a service, for example through Development, Test, QA and Production, allowing for approval and checks before moving to the next stage. APIs The product has Web service, JEE EJB and ATOM/REST based APIs for accessing and manipulating data within the registry. UDDI synchronisation can be enabled to provide integration with products supporting the UDDI v3 API. Extension points Validators, Modifiers and Notifiers. There are defined extension points (similar to a User exit) which allow a custom piece of code to be run within the product when an event occurs. This could be when an object is created, updated or deleted, or when a transition occurs from one life cycle state to another. Integration When combined with an ESB, can provide dynamic endpoint lookup. This allows services to be redirected based upon information retrieved from the registry. ESB's which include primitives to support this out of the box include DataPower, WESB and WebSphere Message Broker. Other ESB's can use one of the WSRR APIs to look up the endpoint information. Version history Version 8.5.6 (October 2015) This release added a user interface enhancement that enables users to display their REST services in a Swagger viewer, when they describe their REST services using Swagger 2.0. Mediation runtime policy ordering allows WSRR, as the policy administration point, to now specify the order in which Service Level Definition (SLD) policies are enforced in DataPower. Custom, runtime policy filters provide WSRR, as the policy administration point, the ability to insert custom Message Content Filters (MCF) into the response to allow the DataPower Multi-Protocol Gateway (MPGW) to perform advanced functions. Added support for POWER8 Little-Endian on SUSE Linux‚Ñ¢, Red Hat Linux (RHEL), and Ubuntu operating systems. Users can test their promotion configuration from the governance master to runtime before actually performing a promotion. Users can download all relevant documents, including SOAP (WSDL) and REST (Swagger 2.0) service interfaces, as a single zip file. The ability to insert a random UUID into any property by using the configurable modifier. Documentation is created regarding how to use the UUID to create context and consumer IDs when an SLA and version are created for a service. The 8.5.6 release was a \\"mod pack\\" which means it can be applied as a fix pack to an existing 8.5 installation. Version 8.5.5 (March 2015) This release added user interface enhancements that enable: * Simplified SOAP service registration by new wizards and a new editing User Interface. * Simplified view of a service on one page, using tabs to show endpoints, interfaces, and details. * Simplified registration of a consuming service or application, by a new wizard. A bulk load tool which loads a spreadsheet containing service definitions into WSRR and creates the service definition objects in WSRR. A simplified service management profile which reduces the steps in the life cycle for services, service level definitions and applications. The profile also has simplified labels for states of objects and transitions to move between states. Simplified promotion process where all objects on the target system are updated when a promotion happens to that system, rather than the previous behavior. Performance improvements when loading large (around 1 MB or larger) WSDL and XSD documents. The 8.5.5 release was a \\"mod pack\\" which means it can be applied as a fix pack to an existing 8.5 installation.

It extends from Zwickau through the valleys of the Zwickauer Mulde and the Schwarzwasser via Bad Schlema and Aue to Schwarzenberg. It opened in 1858 and it is one of the oldest railways in Germany. It is now served by Regionalbahn trains, operated by Erzgebirgsbahn (a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn) between Zwickau and Johanngeorgenstadt. History  The Zwickau‚ÄìSchwarzenberg line originated as the Zwickau‚ÄìBockwa coal railway, which was built by the Saxon State Railways in 1854 to connect the coal mines near Zwickau with markets. To transport coal and supply the mining operations in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains), the line was soon extended along the Mulde and the Schwarzwasser valleys to Schwarzenberg. On 15 October 1855, construction began on the line known as the Upper Ore Mountain Railway () and it opened 15 May 1858, after almost three years of work. Operations  By 1900, parts of the line had been rebuilt for two-track operations. Between Hartenstein and Aue the old single-track line was abandoned completely and replaced by a new straightened realignment. The second track was dismantled in 1946 for reparations to the Soviet Union as a result of World War II. In 1946, the Soviet Wismut company started uranium mining in the Ore Mountain and the line quickly achieved a prominent role for the removal of milled uranium ores and in carrying commuter traffic to the newly established mine shafts. The line was a single-track until 1948, when the second track was restored. Until 1990, express trains operated on the line. Notably there was a daily service between Aue and Berlin. In the 1960s, there was a fast train service with through coaches from Berlin to Cranzahl on the line. Today the line is mainly served by Regionalbahn trains of the Erzgebirgsbahn on the Zwickau‚ÄìJohanngeorgenstadt route. Freight transport still operates, but is insignificant in contrast to the past. Rehabilitation  Despite falling market share in the 1990s, the importance of the route for transport in the western Erzgebirge was undisputed. In 1999/2000 a comprehensive rehabilitation program began with the goal of significantly increasing operating speeds. Between Aue and Schwarzenberg, the line was rebuilt as a single-track line on the two-track subgrade in order to widen the narrow curves. As the enlargement of the Schlema tunnel to meet modern clearances would have been very expensive, the track on this section was also singled. Original plans called for a single track between Zwickau and Schlema. This was not realized for operational reasons, however, especially since the establishment of stations with crossing loops would have been very expensive. Connecting lines  A line opened in 1859 serving the mountain town of Schneeberg from Schlema unterer (lower) station. Because of the mining of uranium under the line by the Soviet Wismut company, the branch line closed about 1950 for safety reasons. The remainder of the line to Oberschlema closed in 1990 and was subsequently demolished. Since 1872, the line has connected to the Chemnitz‚ÄìAue‚ÄìAdorf line via Aue station. The line from Chemnitz to Aue is line now integrated as the Zw√∂nitz Valley Railway (Zw√∂nitztalbahn) in the network of the Erzgebirgsbahn company. Construction of the Eibenstock dam in 1975 severed the line to Adorf and since the mid-1990s the remainder of the line to Blauenthal has not operated. The line was extended from Schwarzenberg to Johanngeorgenstadt (Schwarzenberg‚ÄìJohanngeorgenstadt line) in 1883 and to Annaberg in 1889 (Annaberg-Buchholz‚ÄìSchwarzenberg line). Both lines are still in operation. However, the line to Annaberg-Buchholz has had no scheduled passenger traffic since 1997 and only freight traffic to Gr√ºnst√§dtel. A narrow gauge line opened in 1881 from Wilkau-Ha√ülau to Kirchberg, which was later extended through the ridges of the Erzgebirge mountains to Carlsfeld. This was longest narrow gauge railway in Saxony until it ceased operation in 1973. Route  Aue station The route begins on the south side of Zwickau Hauptbahnhof and leaves the station to the south with a curve to the west. Soon after, a line runs to the left that connects to the tram track (which has been converted to mixed gauge with three rails) and extends to central Zwickau, which is used by the trains of Vogtlandbahn on the Zwickau Zentrum‚ÄìKraslice route. An almost straight track leads south through the Zwickau suburbs of Schedewitz and Cainsdorf to Wilkau-Ha√ülau. From 1881 to 1973, a narrow gauge line ran from Wilkau-Ha√ülau to Kirchberg and later Carlsfeld. Shortly after Wilkau Ha√ülau the line passes under the former narrow gauge line and then under the huge valley-spanning viaduct of the A72 autobahn (Leipzig‚ÄìHof). The line passes through Silberstra√üe, Wiesenburg and F√§hrbr√ºcke along the narrow valley of the Zwickauer Mulde. Near Hartenstein station, the line passes Burg Stein castle then runs through a narrow wooded valley. Shortly after, it passes the railway buildings of the former Shaft 371 uranium mine, once the deepest mine in Europe. A platform operated until the early 1990s for Wismut mine passenger traffic. After the next station, Schlema unter (lower), the line passes through the only tunnel en route to Aue. In Aue, the line crosses the route of the former Chemnitz‚ÄìAue‚ÄìAdorf line then leaves the Mulde valley. The route has several extremely tight curves, climbing the Schwarzwasser valley then reaches Lauter. Finally, it passes through Schwarzenberg Neuwelt and terminates at the Schwarzenberg station.

History  The engine equipped the N1 rocket which had four consecutive launch failures all due to this engine. Its successor the NK-33 allowing multiple fire resistance tests and increased life service was to be used on the N1F, a new version of the N1, but the program was canceled.

It existed from 1940, and as a statutory Industrial Development Board from 1948 to 1972, known in its last years as the Textile Council. Funding, aims and purpose Prior to the war, the main organisation representing the cotton industry was the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations, established in 1925.R. Robson, The Cotton Industry in Britain (London: Macmillan, 1957), pp. 217‚Äì21 A voluntary Cotton Board was set up in 1940 to ‚Äúpromote the welfare of the industry by internal reorganisation, by the development of export trade, scientific research, propaganda and other means.‚Äù Sir Stafford Cripps praised the work of the voluntary Cotton Board in a speech at the Midland Hotel, Manchester on 4 December 1946. The board was given statutory status in 1948 under the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947. The Board had equal representation from industry and trades unions, with four members each, plus three independent members. It was given the power to levy up to ¬£250,000 a year from the industry.A new Cotton Board, The Times, 5 January 1948, page 2 Although it was intended to be essentially focused on changing the industry through its own efforts, David Clayton says: ‚ÄúFrom the mid-1950s ... the Cotton Board also became a lobby organization demanding changes to industrial and commercial policies.‚ÄùBuy British: The Collective Marketing of Cotton Textiles, 1956‚Äì1962 David Clayton, Textile History, 41 (2), 217‚Äì235, November 2010Marguerite Dupree, ‚ÄòThe Cotton Industry: a Middle Way Between Nationalisation and Self- Government?‚Äô, in Helen Mercer, Neil Rollings and Jim Tomlinson eds, Labour Government and Private Industry, the Experience of 1945‚Äì51 (Scotland: Edinburgh University Press, 1992), pp. 137‚Äì62. Its headquarters was in Manchester, together with the ‚ÄúColour, Design and Style Centre‚Äù, which became the public face of the board.www.spinningtheweb.org.uk, access date 2010-12-0-2 Research and development The Board funded research into cotton fabrics via an industry- wide levy. This was undertaken by the British Cotton Industry Research Association, better known as the Shirley Institute. By the 1960s, research also covered man-made fabrics, whose manufacturers began to pay a research levy to the Board from 1961,Cotton Board on way out? The Times, 9 February 1965, page 17 and the Shirley Institute was merged with the British Rayon Research Association.Hansard, written answers, 9 February 1961 Industrial reorganisation and replacement of machinery The Board also engaged in a major attempt to reorganise the cotton industry, initiated by the Cotton Industry Act 1959. Nicholas Ridley, recounting the Board's history during the 1971 debate preceding its dissolution, said that in 1959, the Board engaged in co-ordination of a > major reorganisation of the industry, entailing the scrapping of machinery > and compensation for redundant workers in the industry, [which] was carried > through with great success and great expedition. However, a combination of reduced consumer demand, poor marketing and cheaper Commonwealth imports during the period of reorganisation created, a ‚Äúcomplete lack of confidence in the industry‚Äù according to the Board‚Äôs chairman Lord Rochdale.Costly new machines idle in cotton mills, The Times 15 May 1962, page 6 This both reduced the amount asked for by industry and invested by the government and resulted in machinery being installed in mills that either closed or became idle. Furthermore, because of the need to replace machinery on a ten-year cycle, idleness was likely to mean that investments would not be recouped. Ridley concluded: > A sum of ¬£38.9 million was spent on the reorganisation of the cotton > industry, of which the Government of the time contributed ¬£24.7 million. It > did not, I fear, come up to the full expectation and did not go as far as > the council had hoped in reorganising the industry. But I feel that > undoubtedly the verdict of history will be that this was a successful > operation in adaptation, for which the council should be given full credit. Productivity enquiry and import tariffs Between 1967 and 1969, the Textile Council conducted an enquiry into the productivity of the industry, and produced a major report. The report recommended a move away from cotton import quotas to imposition of tariffs on cotton goods imported from the British Commonwealth and elsewhere to protect British industries. The recommendation was accepted by Wilson‚Äôs Labour government and its Conservative successor. Anthony Crosland, speaking for the government in the 1969 debate, claimed that: > There is no reason to think that, with the possible exception of India, the > developing countries of the Commonwealth generally will be able to export > less to Britain over a tariff of this amount than they would under a > continuation of the quota system. So far as India is concerned, the > Government will, when the time comes to determine the level of aid to India > after 1972, take into account, against the background of India's general aid > requirements at that time, any adverse effects on her exports arising from > the tariff. The rates suggested by the report were accepted by the government, and came into effect in 1972. Anthony Crosland, speech, Cotton and Allied Textiles (Report), House of Commons debates, 22 July 1969 They were: > 6¬Ω per cent. on yarn, 15 per cent. on cotton cloth, which accounts for the > greater part of the trade, and 17 per cent. on most garments Anthony > Crosland, answer in Cotton and Allied Textiles (Report), House of Commons > debates, 22 July 1969 Other important recommendations concerned investment, multi-shift working and better links between production and marketing. The recommendation to finance 40% investment grants was rejected as the government felt it would ‚Äúnot be justified in singling out this industry for financial assistance on such a scale‚Äù. The government also decided to encourage further mergers among smaller firms. The policies were carried forward by the next Conservative government. Ridley said, during the dissolution debate that: > All who have read the report which it produced will agree that it was a most > comprehensive, penetrating and full document, which earned the commendation > of all concerned with the cotton textile industry. Promotional work Between 1956 and c. 1962, the Cotton Board organised promotions to try and increase sales of Lancashire cotton within the UK, using generic marks, particularly the slogan ‚ÄòBuy British Cottons‚Äô. it was responsible for initiatives which included work on new methods for utilising labour, design innovations, recruitment and training, and the encouragement of collaboration within the cotton industry. British fashion designs and fabrics were showcased at national and international exhibitions, ranging from an exhibition on the history of the cotton mills and a display of 1960s children's clothing to soft furnishing promotions at large stores and national fashion shows. Dissolution of the statutory Textile Council and formation of the voluntary British Textile Council The Cotton Board was renamed the Textile Council in 1967. It was dissolved in 1971-2, at its own request, as it was felt the work would be better handled by a new voluntary British Textile Council.Textile Council (Dissolution) House of Commons debates, 14 December 1971 Key personnel Chairs :1940: Raymond Streat\\"Preface, Lancashire and Whitehall: The Diary of Sir Raymond Streat, By Sir Raymond Streat and Marguerite Dupree.

This formation is located outside the parish of Cria√ß√£o Velha, in the municipality of Madalena, on the western flanks of the island of Pico. The cave system formed from a series of pƒÅhoehoe lava flows which originating from the Cabe√ßo Bravo parasitic cone about 500 to 1500 years ago. The caves are a group of interconnected lava tubes between 0.5‚Äì22 metres (2‚Äì72 ft) width, created from both pƒÅhoehoe and aƒÅ types of lavas generated during different geological periods. It has a height between 1.1 and 15 metres (3.6‚Äì49 ft) and is located at an elevation of . With an estimated length of over it is the longest lava cave in the Azores.Greg Middleton AZORES ‚Äì 2004 11th International Symposium on Vulcanospeleology Access to the cave was managed by the Mountaineering Association (‚ÄúOs Montanheiros‚Äù ‚Äì N√∫cleo da Ilha do Pico). Starting in 2011, AZORINA, SA took over the management and organization of the cave. The cave doesn't have a date of discovery but the first scientific exploration was in 1990. The cave's uniqueness lies in its impressive drainage pattern, which can be shown by the presence of more than seven layers on the walls, with lateral benches and three cornices. Gruta das Torres is one of the 17 caves (out of 28 found here) in Pico Island of the 30 caves chosen for Azores as a whole (from an overall list of for inscription under the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites proposed by the Government of Azores). Discovery Entrance covered with vegetation The Gruta das Torres's doesn't have a date of discovery but the first scientific exploration was in 1990. Between March 28 and April 23, 1991, a \\"three dimensional braided system\\" was documented by a team of speleologists when the cave was recorded as the longest lava tube in Azores with the explored length of 3350 metres. The total length is still uncertain as parts of the tube have not been accessed yet, but it is estimated as over 5200 metres. Declared a national natural monument by the Portuguese Environmental Department, the Azores Regional Government declared the cave a regional natural monument on March 18, 2004 (Monumento Natural Regional DLR N.¬∞ 6/2004/A), the second regional natural monument to gain such a distinction, and to be honored for its unique geological setting and its length in Azores. Following this, a visitor center was planned and built as a facility for visitors. It is also inferred that the caves are a part of the volcanic phenomenon in the mountains of Azores that occurred about 1000 years ago. Geography Relief map showing the location of Gruta das Torres in the Azores Relief map showing Gruta das Torres is located in the western-central part of Pico Island The Gruta das Torres is located on the lower western slope of Mount Pico, located in the parish of Cria√ß√£o Velha in Madalena in the western-mid part of the island of Pico, in the central-south of the Azores. The Torres Grotto is one of 28 larger caves and eight pits discovered in the island of Pico, which has the largest number of caves of any island in the Azores. Most of these caves lie in the western half of Pico Island. Formation The Gruta das Torres is located on the slope of Pico, further down than Furna de Frei Matias, a large cave inside Pico's cone. The largest lava tube, cited by various sources to either be the longest or second longest in Azores formed by a volcanic eruption originating in Cabe√ßo Bravo. The main part of the tunnel is fairly large with a height of 15 metres in places, although the top side of the tunnel is very small. One of the lava tubes in the Gruta das Torres The lava tunnel is at a ten-minute walking distance to the south of Madelena. A signpost near Criacao Vella directs to the Grutas Das Torres. The cave has two entrances. The first entrance is open to the sky or a day lighted roof at one end of the tunnel. The other entry is a tunnel cavern opening which is inferred to have been formed due a slump in the roof. The tunnel has clear pƒÅhoehoe lava in some reaches while in some other reaches the roof has collapsed with large lava blocking the tunnel route making access hazardous and narrow. Lava gutters are also seen. A number of secondary tunnels also have impressive geological formations. The lava tubes have picturesque formations of stalactites (lavacicles), stalagmites, lava, lava benches and side balls or balls of lava. Considering the large size of the cave, with further scientific studies more faunal species may be discovered. The liquid lava that dripped from the roof of Gruta das Torres has formed into picturesque stalactite and stalagmite and also in several other formations and shapes. Inside the tunnel, it is humid as water drips from the roof and a constant temperature of is recorded throughout the year. However, the entrance has a slightly higher temperature. The total drop is approximately . The tunnels formed within a pƒÅhoehoe type lava flow. The top of the flow cooled against the air and formed a solid crust, while beneath it the liquid lava continued to move. As the amount of liquid lava passing through them decreased, the tunnels emptied. Silica oxide is also seen in walls of the cave in some stretches of the cave. At the main entrance, after passing through the ‚ÄòAlgar da Ponte‚Äô (\\"Algar Bridge\\"), there is an avenue of trees. Some forms of plant life like ferns, mosses and lichens are also noted at the portal, floor and walls of the cave opening. Deep inside, in the darker regions of the cave, mold, bacteria and insects have been identified. The troglobite faunal species found, typical of such caves, are the endemic species of Trechus Pico Machado and Cixius azopicavuz Hoch. UNESCO Heritage List Considering the large number of caves found in the Azores archipelago ‚Äì 271 caves under four categories of Rank A, B, C and D, the Government of Azores has initiated a proposal for submission of a few selected caves to UNESCO for inscribing under the UNESCO World Heritage List. A Working Group on Volcanic Caves of Azores supported by the Azorean Speleological Inventory and Classifying System database has identified 30 Volcanic Caves of Rank A, which are located in the Graciosa, Pico, S√£o Jorge, S√£o Miguel and Terceira islands for inclusion in the UNESCO List. Of these 30 volcanoes identified for UNESCO recognition, Pico island has the maximum number of 17 volcanic caves in the proposal, which includes the Gruta das Torres cave. The selection criteria for inclusion of the caves in the list was based on the scientific value, tourism prospects, approach conditions, perceived threats, data base and conservation standing. Tourism Lavacicles on the roof of one of the Gruta das Torres lava tubes The first are accessible to visitors accompanied by a guide. A visitor centre built in basalt rocks and aesthetically merging with the environment, provides a guided access into the cave. The Gruta das Torres has been open to the public since 2005. Visitors are allowed in groups of 15 at a time and each visitor is provided with a protective gear of a helmet fitted with lamps to see the dark interior. At the visitor centre, audiovisual presentations in English and Portuguese give details about the cave. As of 2011, the tours are scheduled for 10:30, 12:00, 13:30, 15:00 and 16:30 for the months of higher visitation (15 June to 15 September). The Visitors' Support Centre at the entrance to the cave has innovative architectural features ‚Äì ‚Äúa circular sweep and a linear spatial organization ‚Äì a sequence of programmatic spaces that prepare visitors for the spectacle below.‚Äù It was awarded the \\"European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture Mies van der Rohe Award 2007\\", in Barcelona. It was a formal award presented by the European Union, in association with the Mies van der Rohe Foundation. The innovative construction of the visitor center ensures that the cave entrance has full exposure to the skylight. To achieve this, the layout has incorporated techniques of local building architecture in the form of 'currais de figueira' meaning 'fig tree walls‚Äù structure. Such walls used to be part of the vineyards in the region as protection from wind and seawater. This front elevation forms the natural southern part of the building. The wall which is in height has an ‚Äúopen-weave structure‚Äù or undulating structure to permit natural lighting to the entire building, thus eliminating provision of windows. It also provides protection to the entrance into the tunnel. The building also incorporates a design which provides uniform illumination of the interior. It eliminates the need for other openings. Except for the wall at the entrance, the main building is painted with a waterproof black colour finish to match with the colour and texture of the vitrified lava inside the cave.

Sabbagh served in Palestine and Macedonia during World War I where he was imprisoned only to later joined Amir Faisal I ibn Hussein, who became king of Iraq, and then returned to Iraq in 1921 to partake in the Iraqi army. His military education extends to courses taken both in Belgium and Britain. In 1924 he became an instructor at the Baghdad Military College where he later taught at the Staff College. Sabbagh was then awarded the position of assistant chief of staff of the Iraqi army in 1937. He was an Arab nationalist which led him to become the head of the Golden SquareIraq 1941 between 1939 and 1941, a group of army officers that had placed heavy influence on Iraq's political scene. During this period, and relating to being an army officer and a pan-Arab nationalist, al-Sabbagh supervised the training of al-Futuwwah youth movement. Established in 1935, and made compulsory for high school students in 1939, the futuwwah movement, via its paramilitary training, sought to transform young Iraqi-Arab youth into future soldiers committed to the cultural, historical, geographical and national unity of the Arab nation. Having admired the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, he worked both with him and Rashid Ali al-Kaylani to negotiate with the Axis powers for support of their pan-Arab goals. Al-Sabbagh supported Rashid Ali as prime minister in 1941 and was responsible as a major advocate of the Anglo-Iraqi War in April and May.

Yiddish has legal status as one of the country's official minority languages. The first Jewish members of the Riksdag, Sweden's parliament, were elected in 1873. History Early history of Jews in Sweden Jews have been permitted to reside in Sweden since the late 18th century. Prior to this, Jews were sought after as teachers of Hebrew in the universities, but the condition for being appointed to the teaching post was that they convert to Lutheranism.Hugo Valentin Judarnas historia i Sverige Lutheran Protestantism was the state religion (since the 16th century) and the only accepted religion. Opposition was strong against other faiths, especially Catholicism. Jews were sought after to stimulate the Swedish economy, and were actively encouraged to settle. They required capital of 2000 riksdalers to obtain a letter of protection (skyddsbrev)Judereglementet ¬ß 8 (Swedish) This included the value of clothes, household gadgets and inventory, regular payments made for upkeep, cash and promissory notes. After the application has been made to the magistrate, the applicant would be given the status of Husbonde and could legally support himself with the trade or business he had chosen. The status of skyddsjude derived from German schutzjude and the legislation in the 18th century regulating Jews in Sweden was put together after the Parliamentary Constitutional Committee (Konstitutionsuttskottet) ) had obtained copies of the German laws regulating Jews in Saxony, Prussia and other German kingdoms and duchies. It was discussed in committee whether Jews should wear a distinguishing mark when walking in the street - perhaps a red or yellow hatband, but this idea was rejected.mentioned in Aaron Isaac's autobiography (in Yiddish) and quoted in Hugo Valentin Judarnas Historia i Sverige (The History of the Jews in Sweden) Poor Jews were subject to deportation, pursuant to a law banning gypsies, tight rope dancers and sellers of barometers. A large number of restrictions were placed on Jews, including restriction to towns: Stockholm, G√∂teborg, Norrk√∂ping and Landskrona: Jews could not reside or own property in the countryside: this restriction was first removed in 1854.Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 13.

In 1870 Jews received full citizens' rights and the first Jewish members of the Riksdag, Aron Philipson and Moritz Rubenson, were elected in 1872.Svenska judarnas historia (History of Swedish Jewry), Gothenburg Jewish Community. However Swedish non-Protestants, most of which were Catholics and Jews, were still not allowed to teach the subject of Christianity in public schools or to be cabinet ministers (statsr√•d). (These restrictions were not removed until January 1, 1953.) During the early 1900s, the journalist Mauritz Rydgren planned an antisemitic broadsheet. Barthold Lund√©n published such a newspaper, named Vidi, between 1919 and 1931. In 1923, Lund√©n also founded the Swedish Antisemitic Union (Svenska Antisemitiska F√∂reningen; SAF).L√∂√∂w (2004), p. 13.  Fascists, Nazis and the Holocaust  Several Swedish fascist and Nazi parties, formed during the 1920s and 1930s, were generally strongly antisemitic and/or grew out of the milieu of the Antisemitic Union (even though it was formally dissolved in 1931). On 22 January 1932, the largest of these parties, the Svenska nationalsocialistiska partiet (Swedish National Socialist Party) held its first public rally, when Birger Furug√•rd addressed an audience of 6,000 at the Haymarket in Stockholm. The peak in popularity for Swedish Nazis came in the municipal elections of 1934 when Nazi parties were victorious in over 100 electoral contests.L√∂√∂w (2004), p. 244 During 1933‚Äì39, some 3,000 Jews migrated to Sweden to escape persecution in Nazi Germany. Because Sweden was neutral during World War II, it became a place of asylum for Jews from occupied Europe: in 1942, 900 Norwegian Jews were given asylum from Nazi persecution and, in October 1943, almost the entire Danish Jewish community, some 8,000 people, was transported to Sweden (see Rescue of the Danish Jews). Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg also saved thousands of Hungarian Jews in Budapest by providing them with \\"protective passports\\". He also rented 32 buildings, funded by the United States, and declared them Swedish diplomatic facilities, thus bringing them under protection of diplomatic immunity. Following the war, Swedish Nazis remained strongly antisemitic; as early as May 1945 became early adopters of Holocaust denial.L√∂√∂w (2004), p. 108 During the immediate post-war period, far right parties were relatively inactive politically. The fascist Nysvenska R√∂relsen (NSR, New Swedish Movement, formed in 1941 as Svensk Opposition) attempted to distance itself from its own history and Nazi Germany. The NSR cultivated ties to similar organizations in other countries and established an employment office in Malm√∂ for expatriate Danes and Norwegians who had fled to Sweden after collaborating with wartime German occupation forces. In 1956, a new Swedish Nazi party, the Nordiska Rikspartiet (NRP; \\"Nordic Reich Party\\"), was formed. It had a paramilitary faction called the National Action Group (RAG, Riksaktiongruppen), and several of its members were convicted of assaults and threats. (In the late 1980s one of the RAG activists was selected as chair of the newly formed Sweden Democrats.) There was a so-called \\"Swastika epidemic\\" in 1960, when the painting of swastikas spread rapidly in many countries. US rabbi Max Nussbaum alleged that the swastika-painting campaign was led from Malm√∂ by Per Engdahl. Engdahl denied this and claimed that the NSR was the victim of a conspiracy by the World Jewish Congress and that Jews themselves were behind the swastikas.L√∂√∂w (2004), p. 57 From the middle of the 1960s, the NSR membership and contributions dropped, and the party languished (with the exception of a few high-profile events).  Neo- Nazis, white supremacists and white nationalists  From the late 1980s, new far right groups espousing antisemitic belief emerged in Sweden. These groups are linked largely by the NRP. In its magazine, Storm, the party stated an ambition to collect all the \\"race-conscious whites\\". These groups included White Aryan Resistance (1991‚Äì93), National Socialist Front (dissolved in 2008) and Legion Wasa (inactive since around 2010). Sweden remains home to active neo-Nazi or white supremacist organizations espousing antisemitic beliefs, including Nordic Resistance Movement. Developments since 2000 Many commentators regard contemporary antisemitism in Sweden as largely a product of mass migration of Muslims who have brought anti-Jewish attitudes from their countries of origin to Sweden. Sweden has the third highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe, following Germany and Austria, although the Netherlands came third in some years.The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism. A government study in 2006 estimated that 15% of Swedes agree with the statement: \\"The Jews have too much influence in the world today\\".Henrik Bachner and Jonas Ring. . levandehistoria.se 5% of the total adult population and 39% of adult Muslims \\"harbour systematic antisemitic views\\". The former prime minister G√∂ran Persson described these results as \\"surprising and terrifying\\". However, the rabbi of Stockholm's Orthodox Jewish community, Meir Horden, said that \\"It's not true to say that the Swedes are anti-Semitic. Some of them are hostile to Israel because they support the weak side, which they perceive the Palestinians to be.\\"Anti-Semitism, in Sweden? Depends who you're asking, Haaretz, 9 November 2007. In 2010, alleged antisemitism among Muslims in Malm√∂ received media attention after a controversial interview with the then city's mayor, Ilmar Reepalu. In March the same year, Fredrik Sieradzk of the Jewish community of Malm√∂ told Die Presse, an Austrian newspaper, that Jews are being \\"harassed and physically attacked\\" by \\"people from the Middle East,\\" although he added that only a small number of Malm√∂'s 90,000 Muslims \\"exhibit hatred of Jews.\\" The population of Malm√∂ began to decrease in the 1970s due to decline of the once- dominant shipbuilding and textile industries. This also led to a decrease in the Jewish population. Sieradzk has stated that approximately 30 Jewish families have emigrated from Malm√∂ to Israel in the past year, specifically to escape from harassment estimating that the already small Jewish population is shrinking by 5% a year. \\"Malm√∂ is a place to move away from, right now many Jews in Malm√∂ are really concerned about the situation and don‚Äôt believe they have a future here\\" he said, citing antisemitism as the primary reason. The Malm√∂ Synagogue suffered arson attacks in 2010 and 2012. The Swedish newspaper Sk√•nska Dagbladet reported that attacks on Jews in Malm√∂ totaled 79 in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics.Report: Anti-Semitic attacks rising in Scandinavia , Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), March 22, 2010. In December 2010, the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express \\"extreme caution\\" when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal and physical harassment of Jewish citizens in the city of Malm√∂. However, the leader of the Jewish congregation would have liked the center to consult them before issuing the warning. Fred Khan, the congregation's chairman told Sydvenska Dagbladet suggested that the rise in the crime statistics might not reflect an actual increase in crimes endured by the community over the proceeding year. Members of the congregation do face harassment, but a substantial degree of the incidents remain unreported to the police. In the last year members of the community had been more strongly advised to report all abuse to the police. On June 8, 2012, antisemitic graffiti was spray-painted on the external wall of the old Jewish cemetery in Malm√∂. The graffiti reads \\"A PIG\\" in Swedish (en gris) and a swastika. On September 28, same year, an explosion occurred at a Malm√∂ Jewish community building. Since 2014, several members of Sverigedemokraterna (SD; \\"Sweden Democrats\\"), a political party represented in the Swedish Riksdag, have been accused of expressing antisemitic views. While the party (founded in 1988) describes itself as social conservative and nationalist, it initially had ties to fascist, white supremacist and other far right groups.Rydgren, 2006, pp. 108‚Äì109. Contemporary acts of antisemitism According to CFCA (the Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism), antisemitism in Sweden nowadays focuses on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. A survey conducted by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights found out that in 2012, 40‚Äì50% of Swedish Jews had frequently heard the accusation that \\"Israelis behave to the Palestinians like the Nazis to the Jews\\". Moreover, a series of proposed measures in Sweden banning kosher slaughter, ritual circumcision, and possibly even the importation of kosher meat, had caused a Swedish Jewish activist to file for asylum in her own country. Also In 2012, the President of the European Jewish Congress, Moshe Kantor condemned the behavior of the Swedish Government which according to him is \\"the only European country that is refusing to discuss the problem of Anti-Semitism prevailing within its borders\\". In 2013, a total of ten Antisemitic incidents were reported, including antisemitic statements made publicly by Swedish politicians, swastikas which were drawn on Jewish property and the Slogan \\"Burn Israel Burn\\" which was printed on T-shirts. In 2015 the journal Ethnic and Racial Studies published a research conducted between 2003‚Äì2009 in secondary school students in Sweden. Its goal was to examine changes in antisemitic attitudes among youngest. The results of the survey showed no significant change in the total level of antisemitism between the two groups of youths (the group of 2003 and the group of 2009). However, addition results imply other differences: In 2003, students living in the big cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂ have the highest levels of antisemitism, compared to 2009, when students living in smaller municipalities and the countryside have the highest significant levels of antisemitism. More findings showed that in both 2003 and 2009 students born outside of Sweden, or their parents were born outside Sweden, display higher levels of antisemitism compared to students born in Sweden. In December 2017 a dozen men hurled Molotov cocktails at a synagogue in Gothenburg. No injuries were reported, and those inside the building hid in the basement. The incident followed a pro- Palestinian protest.Firebombs Hurled at Synagogue in Sweden Following Protests Against Jerusalem, Haaretz, 10 December 2017 Two day later, an arson attack took place at a Jewish cemetery.After second incident, Swedish anti-Semitism watchdog warns of wave of attacks, JTA, 11 December 2017 Situation in Malm√∂ since 2009 On 13 January 2009, Molotov cocktails were thrown inside and outside a funeral chapel at the old Jewish cemetery in the city of Malm√∂, south Sweden, in what seemed to be an antisemitic act. It was the third time the chapel had been attacked in the few weeks before this incident. In March 2010, Fredrik Sieradzk of the Jewish community of Malm√∂ told Die Presse, an Austrian newspaper, that Jews were being \\"harassed and physically attacked\\" by \\"people from the Middle East,\\" although he added that only a small number of Malm√∂'s 40,000 Muslims \\"exhibit hatred of Jews.\\" Lea Gleitman, an Auschwitz survivor who had dedicated her life to teaching about the Holocaust, stated that she was being called a liar when teaching about the Holocaust at Muslim- majority schools. Sieradzk also stated that approximately thirty Jewish families had emigrated from Malm√∂ to Israel in the previous year, specifically to escape from harassment, estimating that the already small Jewish population was shrinking by 5 per cent a year. \\"Malmo is a place to move away from, right now many Jews in Malm√∂ are really concerned about the situation and don‚Äôt believe they have a future here\\" he said, citing antisemitism as the primary reason. In 2010, The Forward reported on the current state of Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and professor of history at the University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament had attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic‚Äînot just anti-Israel. But such public rhetoric had not been branded as hateful and denounced. Charles Small, director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Antisemitism, stated that \\"Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It's a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.\\" Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet, has sharply criticized politicians who he claims offer \\"weak excuses\\" for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. \\"Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault.\\" As of 2010, the Jewish community of Malm√∂ consisted of about 700 individuals, most of whom were descendants of refugees from Poland and Germany during the Second World War. The Swedish newspaper Sk√•nska Dagbladet reported that there had been 79 attacks on Jews in Malm√∂ in 2009, about twice as many as the previous year, according to police statistics. Judith Popinski, an 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, told The Daily Telegraph that she was no longer invited to schools with a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malm√∂ in 1945, stated that, until recently, she had told her story in Malm√∂ schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools were no longer asking Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treated them with such disrespect, either ignoring them or walking out of the class. She further stated that \\"Malmo reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden any more.\\" In December 2010, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization, issued a travel advisory concerning Sweden, advising Jews to express \\"extreme caution\\" when visiting the southern parts of the country due to an increase in verbal, physical, and violent harassment of Jews in the city of Malm√∂. On September 6, 2012, the international United Nations Watch organization discussed the anti- Semitic attacks in Malm√∂ and stated it considered the phenomenon extremely serious, given Sweden's candidacy for membership in the UN Human Rights Council.sverige-infor-fn-om-antisemitismen-i-malmo dated 2012/09/06 The organization called on Sweden to supply adequate protection for the Jewish community and to develop special initiatives aimed at educating against antisemitism. It also reprimanded Reepalu for what it viewed as his multiple defamatory and incendiary remarks concerning the Jewish community in Malm√∂ and the antisemitism it faces. Moreover, recent articles over the looming attacks on Malm√∂'s Jewish community were published in the Swedish media also during the year of 2012, in particular an attack on a Jewish center on 28 September 2012. In the wake of a report that marked Malm√∂ as a hub for antisemitic actions in Sweden, the discourse further dealt with the inquiry over the roots of that antisemitism, whether linked with classic Jewish-hatred or exacerbated by the prolonged Arab-Israeli conflict.antisemitismen-hos-malm-s-muslimska- befolkning I wanted to build bridges between Jews and Muslims in Malm√∂ because antisemitism is a problem in the city.

Because of his social activism focused on reducing antisemitism and xenophobia, the selection committee said Derakhti set a \\"positive example\\" in his hometown of Malm√∂ and throughout Sweden.Siavosh Derakhti, a young Muslim, defends Jews and others targeted by hate crimes The Christian Science Monitor, 15 November 2013 On Nov. 8, 2012, the Swedish Committee Against Antisemitism gave Derakhti its first Elsa Award, established by Committee member Henrik Frenkel in memory of his parents \\"to encourage young people to incorporate social media into the battle against Swedish ant-Semitism\\".Machzorim for Lund: A Ray of Hope The Baltimore Jewish Times, 14 July 2013 In December 2017, after president Donald Trump announced that Jerusalem will be recognised as the capital of Israel by the United States, there was a spontaneous demonstration in a central square M√∂llev√•ngstorget where some 200 people who shouted that \\"an intifada has been proclaimed from Malm√∂ and we will shoot the Jews\\". The following day another crowd gathered to shout that \\"Jews must remember that the army of Muhammad will return\\". No organiser for the crowd could be identified. 2009 Davis Cup In 2009, Malm√∂ hosted a tennis match between Israel and Sweden during the Davis Cup, after the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. The Malm√∂ Municipality politicians were concerned about extremists, and decided due to security reasons to only let a small audience in.Crowd ban 'risks bolstering extremists'. The Local 7 March 2009. However, numerous Swedish politicians had called for the match to be cancelled due to their pro-Palestinian views and the aftermath of the Gaza War, with this idea being discarded because the Swedish side would have had an automatic forfeit loss, and therefore the team's elimination, from the Cup tournament. A plan to move the match from Malm√∂ to Stockholm failed due to logistical issues and a lack of time. In the end, Israel defeated and eliminated the Swedish team by a 3‚Äì2 score. The match drew more than 6,000 pro-Palestinian protesters, making it one of the largest demonstrations against Israel in Swedish history. More than 100 protesters were detained as several hundred Arab nationalists and supporters of the far- left clashed with more than 1,000 policemen that were guarding the stadium. Malm√∂ was banned from hosting any further Davis Cup matches in the aftermath of the riots. The city was also fined $25,000 by the International Tennis FederationTennis Guru: Sweden vs Israel Davis Cup Tie to Take Place Without Spectators (lowered to $5,000 on appeal) and forced to pay an additional $15,000 to recoup revenues lost when spectators were barred from the match. Ilmar Reepalu Swedish newspapers and political leaders as well as Israeli media have criticised Malm√∂'s mayor, Ilmar Reepalu (a Social Democrat), for denying the rise of Antisemitism in Malm√∂. .Malm√∂ mayor says unaware of level of attacks on Jews by Peter Vinthagen Simpson, The Local, February 26, 2010.Swedish mayor blasts Zionism Y Net news. 28 January 2010Column One: Keeping Zionism's promise The Jerusalem Post. 29 January 2010Swedish mayor calls both Anti-Semitism and Zionism forms of 'unacceptable extremism' Haaretz. 29 January 2010 When confronted with the issue during an interview in 2010 with Andreas Lov√©n, a journalist in Sk√•nska Dagbladet, Reepalu stated: \\"We accept neither Zionism nor anti-Semitism. They are extremes that put themselves above other groups, and believe they have a lower value.\\" He also criticized the Malm√∂'s Jewish community for its support for Israel, stating that \\"I would wish for the Jewish community to denounce Israeli violations against the civilian population in Gaza. Instead it decides to hold a [pro-Israeli] demonstration in the Grand Square [of Malm√∂], which could send the wrong signals.\\" Paula Neuding, \\"Sweden's Damn Jew Problem\\", Tablet, April 5, 2012 Jewish leaders responded that the demonstration Reepalu was referring to was \\"pro-peace rally\\" arranged by the Jewish Community in Malm√∂ \\"which came under attack from members of a violent counter demonstration\\" and accused Reepalu of \\"suggesting that the violence directed towards us is our own fault simply because we didn't speak out against Israel.\\"Jews flee Malmo as antisemitism grows , by David Landes, Jewish Tribune, February 3, 2010. Reepalu has stated that apart from at the demonstration, there had not been any violent attacks on Jews in the city, by claiming to cite police figures. However, the same police figures show that hate crimes against Jews have doubled over the last year.Malm√∂ mayor blasted for 'Israeli lobby' comment, The Local (Sweden's News in English), March 4, 2010.

In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph in February 2010, Reepalu was asked about reports that antisemitism in Malm√∂ has increased to the point that some of its Jewish residents are (or are considering) moving to Israel. Reepalu again denied that there has been any violence directed at Jews in Malm√∂, stating that: Reepalu added on Danish television that the criticism against his statement were a product of pro-Israeli lobbyism. The then leader of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, Mona Sahlin, described Reepalu's comments as \\"unfortunate.\\" Reepalu's statements have been sharply criticized by Sieradzk, who argued that \\"More often it‚Äôs the far-left that commonly use Jews as a punching bag for their disdain toward the policies of Israel, even if Jews in Malm√∂ have nothing to do with Israeli politics.\\" Reepalu later conceded that he has not been sufficiently informed about the vulnerable situation faced by Jews after meeting with community leaders. Reepalu then claimed that Sk√•nska Dagbladet, the newspaper that initially reported many Reepalu's controversial statements, had misrepresented him as antisemitic; the newspaper was subsequently banned from a press conference at City Hall, reportedly at Reepalu's request. In response, Sk√•nska Dagbladet published on its website the full tapes of its interview with Reepalu, as well as all the texts published in its article series on threats and harassment faced by Malm√∂ Jews, and the exchange of emails between the newspaper and the mayor's office.US Jewish centre seeks ban on Malm√∂ mayor, The Local (Sweden's News in English), October 14, 2010. In March 2012, Reepalu again came under criticism from the Jewish community when he told a Swedish magazine that the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim party [Swedish Democrats] had \\"infiltrated\\" the city's Jewish community in order to turn it against Muslims. Reepalu later said he had no basis for his remarks and that he \\"shouldn't have put it that way.\\" Jewish community officials subsequently sent a letter to the Social Democratic leader Stefan L√∂fven condemning what Reepalu had said.

Antisemitic statements by members of Sweden Democrats since 2014 In a 2014 interview with the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, Bj√∂rn S√∂der at the time party secretary of the Sweden Democrats and Second Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag stated that, in his view, people with dual national identities would not necessarily identify as Swedish and immigrants should have to undergo Cultural assimilation. S√∂der stated that officially recognized minorities, including Jews, Sami, and Tornedalians in many cases had dual cultural identities and would probably would be proud of both heritages. However, S√∂der's remarks were widely interpreted as meaning that Jews could not be Swedish unless they abandoned their Jewish identity. The comments caused other parliamentary parties to call for S√∂der's resignation. The Simon Wiesenthal Center listed the statement as number six on their list of the top ten most anti-semitic events of 2014. In an interview with The Jerusalem Post, S√∂der denied the charges of antisemitism and claimed Dagens Nyheter had taken his statements out of context. In October 2016, a video of the parliamentarian and economic policy spokesperson Oscar Sj√∂stedt making antisemitic jokes was released. Whilst at a party, believed to have taken place in 2011, he laughingly told a story about former co-workers with Nazi sympathies mocking Jews and comparing them to sheep. During the same month, the parliamentarian and second vice party leader Carina Herrstedt was confronted with having sent an allegedly racist, antisemitic, homophobic and anti-romaniyst email to her then spouse in 2011. The email, which had been leaked from the party's internal servers, for instance contained phrases that named black football players from the team Landskrona BoIS as niggers whilst also picturing Romani people as thieves. In December 2016, the parliamentarian Anna Hagwall was thrown out of the party after using arguments associated with antisemitism to argue for a bill that she introduced in parliament intended to reduce concentration of media ownership in Sweden. In September 2017, it was brought to light that 14 active or former municipal representatives of the party had supported the Nordic Resistance Movement, a Neo-Nazi organization, financially through memberships or purchases of antisemitic and racist literature or souvenirs.

Custody of British Flag On 2 January 1833, Captain Onslow, of the brig-sloop HMS Clio, arrived at Louis Vernet's settlement at Port Louis to request that the flag of the United Provinces of the River Plate be replaced with the British one, and for the administration to leave the islands.

Life and Works Denzler was born in Zurich.

In 2006 he graduated as Master of Fine Arts from London's Chelsea College of Art and Design. Denzler lives and works in Zurich.

It‚Äôs an alla prima technique, painting wet-on-wet; I control the speed of the painting process, because there is a limited amount of time before the canvas dries\\".Interviev in Creative Boom, by Katie Cowan. Inspiration / Arts & Culture, 14 June 2017, retrieved 15 December 2019 Through the streaks of the blurred image surface, Denzler's paintings appear as if the time on them has momentarily stopped. Denzler's works move between abstraction and reality. With the classic means of oil painting, the artist endeavors to fathom the borderlines between fiction and reality. Through his mostly horizontal use of a squeegee for blurring the oil paint, which he previously applies to the canvas in heavy impasto and thick layers, he achieves the impression of the object's motion blur or the notion of a distorted, faltering video recording. Time freezes. The paintings are snap- shots of events that take place, blurred, distorted movements, Freeze Frames that stylistically move between Photorealism and Abstract Expressionism. In his paintings Denzler frequently alludes to our life in a disruptive age of lens based images.  Reception  In a world seemingly enamoured with high definition and extreme resolution, the distorted photo-like quality of Denzler‚Äôs paintings provides an alternative to our often over-glossed 'reality‚Äò. Intent on pushing the boundaries between abstraction and photorealism, the artist captures the authenticity of the everyday, creating an honest and often intimate moment on canvas. (Reality Glitch, Sch√∂n! Magazine, November 2019Interview with Katie Shuff, Issue 31, November 2019, pages 199 ff retrieved 15 December 2019 ) But unlike many contemporary painters, Denzler doesn‚Äôt reproduce the photographic image onto a canvas to create a template for his work. Instead, he paints freehand, using the photograph as a reference, and building up layer upon layer of wet paint. Then, when he has a 'perfect painting', he deconstructs it, leaving in its wake traces of what was. The vestigial image, boldly striped with horizontal scrapes made by a spatula dragged across the canvas, has the effect of a video that has been permanently put on pause, giving the viewer a sense that something came before, and something will come after. But what remains in the present is a single transient, but captive, moment. (Creative Boom, 14 June 2017 by Katy KowanCreative Boom, Inspiration / Art & Culture, Fragmented Identity: Andy Denzler's blurred and frenzied artworks of distorted moments.) Denzler's new paintings unite the precision and nostalgia of realism with the bold dynamism and pulsating energy of gestural abstraction. Creating mysterious, eerie and sometimes uncomfortable moments, the artist invites the viewer into his private, voyeuristic world. Known for his signature style of thick horizontal bands of pigment traversing the canvas in thick choppy abstract strips ‚Äì staccato points that add visual energy and suggest details lost in the fog of memory, time and space. (Wall Street International Magazine/Arts, 24 January 2014Wall Street International Magazine - Andy Denzler. Between the Fragments, (Arts; United States) 24 January 2014, retrieved 15 December 2019 ) Denzler analyses the medium, the ideational and representational possibilities inherent in present-day painting with dedication and enthusiasm. He has thereby secured himself an important and individual position on the international art scene.

He took part in Bonaparte campaign in Egypt, where he discovered the Dendera Zodiac. Austerlitz He was made major en second (Lieutenant Colonel) of the mounted grenadiers of the Imperial Guard, in 1803, following Austerlitz, where his bravery got him recognised by Napoleon.

Russian Campaign In 1812 he was summoned to join the French invasion of Russia where he led the 3rd Light Cavalry Division in the III Cavalry Corps. His bravery at Borodino gained him a mention in dispatches in the June 1815 bulletin during the Hundred Days. Hundred Days During the return of Napoleon to power, Chastel served as commanding officer of 10th Cavalry Division together with Major General Jean Baptiste Alexandre Strolz' 9th Cavalry Division in General Exelman's II Corps of the arm√©e du Nord.

It was the first workers' co- operative to register under what is now known as the \\"white rules\\", and is listed as Co-op number 1 under the Industrial Common Ownership Movement (ICOM), which now forms part of Co-operatives UK. One of the founding members, Roger Sawtell, was the first chair of ICOM.  History  Daily Bread began in the Northampton parish of St. Peter's, Weston Favell. A group of nine friends - four married couples and a bachelor - formed the idea of taking their Christian beliefs and values into the business environment. Since Daily Bread was founded on the basis of Christian beliefs, the name chosen comes from a line in the Lord's Prayer. One of the founder members, Michael Jones, owned a family firm of jewellers in Northampton. He had been involved in the co- operative model of doing business, and to that end he converted his enterprise into a workers' co-operative. Daily Bread Co-operative (DBC) was registered as a limited company in March 1976,Elfrida Calvocoressi, \\"Leadership in Peacemaking: A Christian View\\" in Luk Bouckaert & Manas Chatterji (eds), Business, Ethics and Peace, Emerald Group Publishing Limited (2015) . Retrieved 26 November 2018. the first business of its kind to adopt a new set of Model Rules for Common Ownership. It was a further four years before trading started, on 1 October 1980, in what was once the laundry of St. Andrew's Hospital, reputedly the largest privately owned psychiatric hospital in the country. The members of the co-operative were faced with challenges, including how to generate wealth without compromising the beliefs to which they adhered, how to provide work for those who might not be able to find it elsewhere (which was a stated secondary goal of the company), and how to balance individual freedom and creativity with the collective responsibility to care for the business, each other and the community.  Social aims  The co-operative has a range of social aims on top of the basic task of providing healthy food to the local and wider community at a fair price. The social aims include: * providing employment to mentally handicapped or disabled people and those rehabilitating into society, who would often find it difficult to obtain and maintain occupation. * a commitment to running the business in an ecologically friendly manner. * donating a proportion of all income (as distinct from profit) to the local and global communities, locally through their Community Fund and globally through their charitable arm, Strive (Overseas) Ltd. The workforce stands at around 25, including members and non- members, full- and part-time, and the annual turnover stands at around ¬£1.3 million. Daily Bread as a workers' co-operative, in common with other co- operatives, runs the business on the democratic principle of \\"one person, one vote\\", meaning that all the members have an equal say in how the business should be run, in contrast to the standard business model where a company is owned by individuals or by a group of shareholders. Daily Bread is different in other ways, such as a wage structure where each worker is paid equally regardless of length of tenure or seeming superiority, with only a slight increase for members over non-members in recognition of extra duties and responsibilities, and possible extra allowances for workers with dependents.  Product range  Daily Bread's product range of wholefoods has increased from about twelve lines in the first few months to over 5,500 different products, and as well as wholefoods the co-operative stocks environmentally friendly cleaning materials, ethical body care products and energy saving gadgets. No products that contain any ingredient derived from an animal are stocked. As well as vegetarians and vegans, Daily Bread also caters to those with other special dietary requirements, including wheat or gluten intolerance and diabetes. While no bread is baked on the premises, Daily Bread does carry a range of its own, cooked-on-site cereals and snacks.  Daily Bread, Cambridge  Daily Bread has served as a model for other co-operatives and wholefood sellers, including the Unicorn Grocery. Daily Bread in Cambridge opened in 1992 with a staff of five, one ex-member from Northampton and four other full-time members. Its structure is similar to Daily Bread in Northampton, and the Cambridge enterprise was given permission to trade under the original name and to use the co-operative's logo.

He trained under his father, William Hurst Ashpitel before setting up his own practice in 1842, and working in partnership with John Whichcord Jr. between 1850 and 1855. Ashpitel's works include the churches of St Barnabas, Homerton and St John the Evangelist, Blackheath. Life Ashpitel's church of St Barnabas at Homerton Early years Ashpitel was born in Hackney, London in 1807, the son of architect William Hurst Ashpitel. He was educated at Dr. Burnet's school in Hackney (see Sutton House, London) and trained as an architect under his father, but two childhood accidents damaged his health, and he did not set up in practice until 1842. One of his first projects was the redevelopment of a site in Houndsditch for Andrew Kennedy Hutchison, on which he built the Hutchison Markets, the Palace Tavern, and between 40 and 50 houses. In 1845 he built the church of St Barnabas at Homerton, a Gothic Revival design in Kentish ragstone, fitted, unusually for the date, with gas lighting. He later added a parsonage, a north aisle and a vestry. Partnership with John Whichcord Jr. \\"Maidstone baths\\", a plate from Ashpitel's Observations on Baths and Wash-houses (1851) In 1850 he entered into partnership with John Whichcord Jr.. Together they designed and superintended the erection of baths and washhouses at Swansea, Maidstone, Lambeth, and elsewhere, and published a pamphlet entitled Observations on Baths and Wash-houses (1851)http://www.bathsandwashhouses.co.uk/archive/archive-books-documents retrieved 23 May 2011 They also designed churches, private houses, and the Ophthalmic Hospital and Kent Infirmary at Maidstone. They turned their attention to the improvement of dwellings for the labouring classes, and, for a committee, erected a block of dwellings for artisans at Lambeth. They promoted the idea of living in flats in a publication called Town Dwellings: an essay on the erection of fireproof houses in flats. Ashpitel was also responsible for design of the \\"Wellington Testimonial\\" a clock tower erected at the southern end of Southwark Bridge, but removed soon after as an obstruction to traffic. At Blackheath he built St John the Evangelist's Church (1852). Later career In 1853 he left England in the company of David Roberts, R.A., and lived for some time in Rome. An attack of malaria, suffered in Piedmont further damaged his health. In 1855, he dissolved the partnership with Whichcord, but continued to accept commissions.. For the Rev. James Reynolds, with whom he had been to school he restored a chapel at Great Ilford, Essex, which had once belonged to a leper hospital, in 1854, adding a porch, and building a residence for it; and wrote a history of the building in 1858. In 1861 he designed a Venetian Gothic facade for a public house in Red Cross Street in the City of London, described by Wyatt Papworth as \\"probably the first attempt to render the mediaeval style appropriate for such a business\\". In 1861 he rebuilt St Mary's Church, Ripple, Kent, on its original Norman foundations, in a Romanesque style, in imitation of St. Nicholas, Barfreston. He also restored Sutton Church, about a mile away, adding an apse, its windows once again copied from those at Barfreston. In 1862 he built the church at Aldborough Hatch in Essex. In 1864 he built schools accommodating seven hundred children for the district of Holy Trinity, Hoxton, at a cost of about ¬£3000. In 1865 he rebuilt the tower and spire of Great Ilford Church and two years later elaborated and enlarged the plain brick church (erected in about 1825), inserting new windows and creating a polygonal chancel and adding a parsonage, all his works there being in a Venetian Gothic style. His last work was a design for twelve almshouses at Clewer, near Windsor, built at the cost of one of his sisters; they were constructed after his death under the supervision of John Whichcord. He also designed the ornament cast on the Westminster Bell, known as \\" Big Ben\\" and assisted E. M. Barry in researching his design for the new Charing Cross. Following his Roman studies he exhibited two drawings at the Royal Academy, a Restoration of Ancient Rome, and Rome As It Is. They were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1858 and 1859 respectively, and were reproduced as chromolithographs, with an explanatory pamphlet. Writings Ashpitel was a prolific writer who contributed to magazines and to the transactions of learned societies and is known to have been a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He first appeared in print at the age of sixteen, with a poem published in the Weekly Literary Magnet. In 1836 he published The Reign of Humbug: a Satire and in 1841 a pamphlet. A few Facts on the Corn Laws, defending the agricultural interest. He revised Peter Nicholson's Carpenter's New Guide and several other professional works for the publisher John Weale. He contributed biographies of architects to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, and papers to the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was a regular contributor to Notes and Queries and the Owl. Death Ashpitel died in Westminster, London on 18 January 1869,http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- deaths-1837-2007?firstname=arthur&lastname;=ashpitel&eventyear;=1869&eventyear;_offset=0 having left a valuable collection of vases and books to the Society of Antiquaries of London (which still remain part of its Library collection), and his two drawings of Rome to the nation; they are now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Located just east of Drakesboro, Kentucky, it was the largest megawatt capacity power plant in Kentucky. The plant currently has a capacity of 1.02-gigawatts (1,025 MW). The plant originally consisted of three coal units, with a combined capacity of 2,632 MW (2,379 MW net). Units 1 and 2 were retired in 2017, and replaced with the natural gas units, and Unit 3 was retired in 2020. History Paradise is located near the site of the former town of Paradise, Kentucky on the Green River. Units 1 and 2, each with a capacity of 741 megawatts (704 MW net), began operation in 1963. Unit 3, with a capacity of 1,150 MW (971 MW net), began operations in 1970. Paradise contains three natural draft cooling towers, and is the only TVA fossil fuel plant with cooling towers. The town was razed by the TVA in 1967 over concerns that ash and other plant emissions would damage residents' health. A barge unloading facility was constructed in 1985 so that coal could be delivered via barge, as well as by train and truck. The Paradise's two original coal-fired generating units were shut down in favor of two natural gas plants that were brought online for commercial production April 7, 2017. The retirement of Units 1 and 2 reduced the coal consumption by nearly half in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. According to the TVA, the authority made strides in cleaning up the emissions coming from their fossil fuel combustion facilities. Graphs and data from the TVA suggest that emissions in sulfur dioxide (), nitrogen oxide (), and carbon dioxide () have dropped dramatically since the mid-1970s. In August 2018, TVA began studying the possibility of closing the remaining unit at Paradise. A final environmental assessment prepared by the TVA concluded that the adverse environmental impacts of these fossil plants outweighed the need for them in this community; therefore it was necessary to close them. On February 14, 2019, the TVA board of directors voted 5-2 to shut down Paradise Unit 3 by December 2020, as well as Bull Run near Oak Ridge, Tennessee in 2023. High costs and low capacity were factors in their decision. This decision came following intense lobbying by the Trump Administration and Kentucky governor Matt Bevin to keep the plant open. Chief Executive, Bill Johnson, of the TVA said that the closing of Paradise and Bull Run's coal units will save consumers approximately $320 million. On February 1, 2020 the last coal-fired unit at Paradise Fossil Plant was shut down after 50 years of operation. Cultural references In 1971, singer/songwriter John Prine, whose father was from Paradise, released a recording of his song titled \\"Paradise\\". The song describes the town, which was strip mined for coal.

Interview with Enrico Braggiotti on MaFinance During the 1980s, the Italian banking system went through deep structural transformations to become international, a process through which most nationalized banks became privately held, including the famous Mediobanca.

Coat of arms ! Map |---- bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" Wappen der Alservorstadt|Bezirksteile des Alsergrunds Bezirksteile der Josefstadt |- !colspan=2Location: |} Alservorstadt was an independent municipality until 1850 and is since then divided between Josefstadt and Alsergrund, the 8th and 9th districts of Vienna, respectively. Geography Alservorstadt spans the south of Alsergrund and the north-east of Josefstadt. The street Alser Stra√üe marks the border between the two districts. The name Alservorstadt (literal translation: suburb of the Als) derives from the river Als, whose which runs through the area and today is covered with concrete throughout the borough. Alservorstadt borders Thurygrund in the north, Ro√üau in the east, the Innere Stadt, Josefstadt and Breitenfeld in the south, as well as W√§hring and Michelbeuern in the west. History Initially, the area was sparsely populated, but after the second siege of Vienna (1683), it was more densely settled, primarily along Alser Stra√üe. At the end of the 17th century, the population of Slovenes, Croats and Slovaks previously residing in Spittelberg were forcibly moved to the so-called Krowotend√∂rfl (literally: 'village of Croats') north of Alser Stra√üe. In 1753, the Alser Kaserne barracks were erected (demolished in 1912). Traditionally, many poorhouses and hospitals were located in Alservorstadt, and their high mortality rate required many cemeteries, such as the Neuer Schottenfriedhof cemetery (documented up to 1784). 1784 also saw the inauguration of the Vienna General Hospital, a then public hospital regarded as modern with respect to contemporary standards. The same period also saw the establishment of the Findelhaus, a bearing house, and the k.k. Gewehrfabrik which became a substantial rifle supplier for the Austrian Army. From 1821 to 1862, the municipality of Alservorstadt maintained a town hall in a two-storey, baroque building located at 8., Laudongasse 5. In 1850, Alservorstadt was officially integrated into the city of Vienna as part of the Alsergrund district. In 1861, the southern part was transferred to the smaller district of Josefstadt. Sights The neo-Gothic Votive Church was constructed from 1856 to 1879 by architect Heinrich von Ferstel. The classicist building of the Josephinum by architect Isidore Carnevale was erected as an academy for military surgeons in the 18th century. From the Schwarzspanierkirche (a former military Lutheran church), only the front fa√ßade remains to this day. Moreover, the Strudlhofstiege is well known, immortalized in Heimito von Doderer's novel of the same name. Other sights include the fountains Wachsamkeitsbrunnen (at Schlesingplatz) and Schubertbrunnen at the border with Ro√üau. The Palais Sch√∂nborn houses the Austrian museum for ethnography while the Federal Pathologic-Anatomical Museum is located in the Narrenturm, Europe's oldest building dedicated to psychiatric patients. Moreover, the U.S. Embassy in Vienna is situated in the north of Alservorstadt. Economy and transportation Alsergrund is well integrated into the Viennese public transit network, in particular with the U-Bahn stations Alser Stra√üe in the west and Schottentor to the east. The headquarters of the Austrian central bank, the penitentiary Justizanstalt Josefstadt and the town hall of Josefstadt are located in the area. Although the Vienna General Hospital has moved to Michelbeuern, some medical institutions remain, in particular the pediatric hospital St. Anna Kinderspital. Moreover, the borough comprises several important educational institutions, such as the campus of the University of Vienna, or the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de Vienne.

To the west of the country park is privately owned Cockleroy Hill (), which is topped by the remains of a prehistoric hillfort. Deer at Beecraigs Location A major attraction of Beecraigs is its location high on the hills above the towns of Bathgate and Linlithgow which afford impressive views of the surrounding countryside, including the Forth Valley, Linlithgow Loch, Binny Craig and Palace, the three Forth Bridges and the Pentland Hills. The Park does not lie on any major routes, and is from the M9 and from the M8 motorways. Reservoir The reservoir, now known as Beecraigs Loch, was built by German Prisoners of War. They were based in a work camp and had been sent from Stobs Camp near Hawick. Clay and stone was used to build the dam wall, this stone was quarried from Riccarton Hill and brought down the slopes to the site using a winch-powered railway. By 1918 the 8 hectare reservoir, holding 82 million gallons of water, began serving as a local water supply and continued to do so for 55 years.https://www.westlothian.gov.uk/media/1346/History-of- Beecraigs/pdf/beecraigs-history.pdf References External links * Beecraigs Country park website * Beecraigs Prehistoric Site, West Lothian Archaeology Group Category:Parks in West Lothian Category:Country parks in Scotland ","title":"Beecraigs"},{"id":"29853899","text":"Robert Hunt (fl. 1809) was an English writer. His infamous reviews of the works of William Blake are amongst the earliest criticism of the poet and painter. Robert was the brother of Leigh Hunt, the well-known writer, and John Hunt (1775‚Äì1848), who founded the Examiner; his writing appeared in this influential journal. His work might have remained in obscurity, if not for a vitriolic attack on the works and character of Blake during 1808 and 1809. The second of these reviews was of Blake's exhibition at Golden Square in London, his illustrations to Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales and its Descriptive Catalogue.'Mr. Blake's Exhibition' in The Examiner No. 90, 17 September 1809, pp. 605‚Äì6, Hunt's review of both these works was pungent, after the failure of the exhibition Blake's response was no less so, > 'The manner in which my character has been blasted these thirty years, both > as an artist and as a man, may be seen particularly in a Sunday paper called > the Examiner, published in Beaufort's Buildings; the manner in which I have > rooted out the nest of villains will be seen in a poem concerning my three > years' Herculean labours at Felpham, which I shall soon publish.'‚ÄîBlake, W., > Ms. (the \\"Rossetti Manuscript\\") Hunt's notice added emphasis to a selection of quotes from Blake's Descriptive Catalogue, as a preface \\"to amuse the reader, and satisfy him of the truth of the foregoing remarks.\\" What follows is what Arthur Symons described as \\"among the infamies of journalism\\". After a moralistic critique of 'insanity' permeating the arts, he focuses on his example, > \\"‚Ä¶ But when the ebullitions of a distempered brain are mistaken for the > sallies of genius by those whose works have exhibited the soundest thinking > in art, the malady has indeed attained a pernicious height, and it becomes a > duty to endeavour to arrest its progress. Such is the case with the > productions and admirers of William Blake, an unfortunate lunatic, whose > personal inoffensiveness secures him from confinement, and, consequently, of > whom no public notice would have been taken, if he was not forced on the > notice and animadversion of The Examiner, in having been held up to public > admiration by many esteemed amateurs and professors as a genius in some > respect original and legitimate. The praises which these gentlemen bestowed > last year on this unfortunate man's illustrations to Blair's Grave have, in > feeding his vanity, stimulated him to publish his madness more largely, and > thus again exposed him, if not to the derision, at least to the pity of the > public. ... Thus encouraged, the poor man fancies himself a great master, > and has painted a few wretched pictures, some of which are unintelligible > allegory, others an attempt at sober character by caricature representation, > and the whole \\"blotted and blurred,\\" and very badly drawn. These he calls an > Exhibition, of which he has published a Catalogue, or rather a farrago of > nonsense, unintelligibleness, and egregious vanity, the wild effusions of a > distempered brain. One of the pictures represents Chaucer's Pilgrims, and is > in every respect a striking contrast to the admirable picture of the same > subject by Mr. Stothard, from which an exquisite print is forthcoming from > the hand of Schiavonetti.\\"‚ÄîHunt, R., The Examiner An earlier review in 1808 is given with his initials, \\"R.H.\\", two columns that contain the only notice published on the publication of Blake's illustrations to Blair's The Grave under the heading 'Fine Arts'.The Examiner (7 August 1808, pp. 509, 510). It was here that the paper's wild and moralistic criticism, calling for censure of Blake's \\"libidinous\\" depictions and descriptions of his works as \\"absurdities\\". Further remarks were added by R. H Leigh Hunt, then editor of the Examiner, listing Blake as a \\"quack\\". Hunt's \\"extravagantly malicious attack\\" on these works was countered in Blake's notebooks, and, as some later critics contend, satirised in his poetry. Contemporary notices that followed echoed the sentiments expressed, but the partisan view of a coddled and talentless madman was submerged by biographical and critical notices that ranged from sympathetic to unconstrained adoration.

Career  Jagger spent the early part of his career in business, and travelled for four years as a business manager in India, China and Burma. He then became a departmental manager in co-operative stores. He was chairman of the York Trades and Labour Council, and became president of the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees, of which he was the chief founder. In 1921 he became general president of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, and held that post until he entered Parliament in 1935. At the 1935 general election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester Clayton, defeating the Conservative MP William Flanagan. The seat had been won by Flanagan in 1931 after it had been held by Labour since 1922. In December 1935 he was a speaker at the Congress of Peace and Friendship with Russia, held in Friends House on the Euston Road in London. In July 1936, he was one eleven MPs who sent a telegram to Prime Minister of Spain expressing their \\"admiration of the heroic fight being put up by the Spanish people against the attack of Fascists\\". The MPs pledged themselves \\"to do everything in our power to rally behind your struggle the whole British people\\". In 1938, he was one of the Labour MPs who visited Spain during the Civil War. In May 1940, when Herbert Morrison became Minister of Supply in the wartime coalition government, Jagger was appointed as his Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS). Morrison was promoted to Home Secretary in October 1940, and Jagger remained his PPS in the new post.  Death  In July 1942, the 69-year-old Jagger had been staying in a cottage in Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire. On 9 July he was riding his motorcycle to Beaconsfield railway station when he collided with a car, and was killed instantly. His death caused a by-election in Manchester Clayton, when the seat was held for Labour by Harry Thorneycroft.  Family  Jagger married Martha Southern in 1899, and they had two sons.

Manaca, written in lower-case letters, is a rechargeable contactless smart card used in Nagoya, Japan and the surrounding area since February 11, 2011, when it replaced the Tranpass magnetic fare card system. As of March 23, 2013, it became compatible with 9 other IC cards, allowing it to be used nationwide. Etymology Yellow balloons with Manaca text The name comes from the Japanese word , meaning \\"center\\", because Nagoya is roughly in the center of Japan, and because it claims to be a central part of your lifestyle. The name, even in Japanese, is written in Roman letters as \\"manaca\\", usually with a lowercase \\"m\\". Usage Manaca has a feature set similar to other prepaid IC Cards used across the country. It provides a convenient method of payment for train and bus fares while also being accepted as payment at some shops, restaurants, and vending machines. Manaca cards can be purchased from ticket machines located in subway, city bus and Meitetsu bus and train stations, and are available in both registered and unregistered form. Registered cards require the buyer to provide their name, date of birth, gender, and phone number, but can be replaced if lost or stolen. A registered card is also required in order to purchase a commuter pass. When a new or replacement card is issued, a 500 yen deposit is required. This deposit is refundable if the card is returned. Once it has been issued, credit can be added by inserting it into a compatible credit terminal at any station, choosing the amount to add, and then inserting bills. Points There are two kinds of point systems for Manaca cards: mileage points and Tamarun points. The point systems vary depending on the card's maker, either MIC or the Nagoya Transportation Development Organization. The maker of the card is printed on the back of the card in the bottom left. All cards accumulate mileage points whereas MIC cards can, when registered, also accumulate Tamarun points. Mileage points are accumulated from spending money stored on the manaca card as transportation fare, such as from riding the subway or non-JR trains. These points are calculated each month and are sent to the \\"point center\\" every month on the 10th, they are not automatically credited to the card. In order to use them as fare, they must be transferred to the card, which can be done at a charging station, ticket machine or ticket window. Despite interoperability with JR Central's TOICA service, points cannot be used for JR train fare and are not accumulated by using JR services. However, cards issued by MIC, once registered online, can also accumulate Tamarun points through purchases paid for with the card at participating vendors. Once acquired, Tamarun points can be used at these vendors to make purchases of goods, but unlike mileage points, these points cannot automatically be used as transportation fare. Points are also preserved when a registered card is replaced due to loss or theft. Discounts When making the following transfers within 90 minutes using a single manaca card, an 80 yen discount is applied: * City bus ‚Üî City bus * City bus ‚Üî Subway * City bus ‚Üî Aonami line * Subway ‚Üî Aonami line * City bus ‚Üî Yutorito Line Raised Zone (Ozone - Obata Ryokuchi) * Subway ‚Üî Yutorito Line Raised Zone (Ozone - Obata Ryokuchi) Scope As of March 23, 2013, the Manaca card began interoperability with nine other major Japanese IC cards, allowing it to be used nationwide.

Built in 1926 and known before 1986 as \\"The Pines,\\" The building was originally an annex to a sanatorium known as The Oxford Retreat, and was sold to the university in 1936 for use as a women's dorm. The hall rotated between a men's and women's dorm for most of its existence. The building became disused during the 2015-16 school year, and the university finalized plans in February 2019 to demolish the building that summer to create green space.  History  The building that became Wilson Hall was originally part of The Oxford Retreat, a private hospital \\"for the treatment of mental and nervous diseases, alcoholic, and narcotic inebriety\\". The main building, which later became Fisher Hall, was torn down in 1979, and was replaced by the Marcum Hotel and Conference Center. Built in 1926, the annex to the hospital was known as \\"The Pines,\\" and was set apart from the main building to house women who were not only affected mentally, but who also had ‚Äúnervous disorders, alcoholic, or narcotic addiction‚Äù. The fireproof building consists of native blue limestone with a red tile roof. After Miami bought the main building of The Oxford Retreat in 1925, The Pines became the main and only building used by the sanatorium.  Acquisition by Miami  During the expansion of Miami University, The Pines became of interest to include in Miami‚Äôs campus, and the university signed a contract for the annex building and other residences on the property on July 17, 1936. The large building was to be used ‚Äúas a dormitory for seventy students‚Äù. The residence that was included in the purchase belonged to the family of Dr. Harvey Cook, the son of the founder of The Oxford Retreat. Cook rented the estate from the university until his death, and it is now occupied by campus offices.  Usage  After $20,025.94 of remodeling, the building, still known as The Pines, began to house students. The building changed frequently from all female to all men‚Äôs dorms through the years, serving as a women's dorm from 1936 to 1939, 1941-1942, 1960 to 1971, and during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The building housed men for the 1940-41 school year, from 1946-1960, and for the fall semester of 1971. Since then, the building operated as a co- ed dorm, though The Miami Student reported that the building had not been occupied since the 2015-16 school year. From 1942 to 1946, the Navy Training School (NTS) that operated at Miami used the building as housing for their radio operator trainees. The US Navy was not the only group to take advantage of the space Miami‚Äôs campus had to offer. In 1945 two professional baseball teams, the Columbus Red Birds and the Rochester Red Wings used the Pines for spring training. alt=  Namesake  The building was used for dorms and training facilities under the name The Pines until 1986, when Miami renamed the building Wilson Hall after Dr. Charles Wilson, a Miami alumnus active for many years in campus governance.  Plans for demolition  In 2010, Miami's Physical Facilities department surveyed the university's 41 dormitories and designated the building \\"higher risk\\" due to its perceived nature as a fire hazard.

The school was founded in 1389 and is therefore one of the oldest schools in the world. The school offers voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs (Preparatory Scientific Education) exclusively and is an independent gymnasium enrolling 822 students and 95 teachers, for a teacher/student ratio of 8.6. Admission The Latin School of Haarlem subscribes to a selective admission policy. A prospective student is required to provide for sufficient material e.g. standardized test scores and a primary school teacher's recommendation. The overall score of the National Standardized Test (Cito-eindtoets) most Dutch students take at the end of sixth grade has to be 85%>. If the student in question does not meet the requirements he or she is not eligible for admission. History Young Haarlem scholar, c.1531 Sint-Bavokerk on the Grote Markt Expansion realized in 1923 by architect Jan Buijs Peace temple in the hortus, built in 1648 Romantic view of the Hortus from the school's front door in 1688 by Romeyn de Hooghe for the Haarlem city map made to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the siege of Haarlem. On the right is the peace temple. The whole map is on display in the St. Bavochurch. In 1389 a Latin school was begun north of the St. Bavochurch in the Schoolsteeg. After the Siege of Haarlem when the city council seized all Catholic possessions, the school moved in 1592 to the quarters of the old Dominican Order monastery located behind the City Hall. The current school is still located there on the Prinsenhof, that can be reached via the Jacobijnestraat. It still offers a classical curriculum, including studies in Latin and Greek. The first rector recorded is 'Meester Gheraerde de scoelmeester' in 1301.Deugd boven geweld, Een geschiedenis van Haarlem, 1245-1995, edited by Gineke van der Ree-Scholtens, 1995, , p88 In 1389 the city was given the privilege of appointing the rector together with the pastor of the Bavo. The rector was paid by the fees paid by students. He also took in students from outside the city and received extra fees for room & board. From his income, he paid the teachers (ondermeesters) himself. The basis for education was the 'artes liberales', whereby parts of the Trivium were given in Latin and the Quadrivium included music, since the choir boys needed to sing in church. For boys studying theology, Hebrew lessons were given in addition to Latin (Greek only became available from 1522). Students wanting to continue their studies, needed to leave the country before the Leiden University was founded in 1579. According to the archives of the Heilige Geest, a religious institution formerly located at what is now the Hofje van Oorschot, they had a fund from 1502 to 1577 (the Satisfactie) for sending good students to Cologne to further their studies there. In 1553, when the school had been run by Junius, they even petitioned Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor for the right to found a university in Haarlem, but this was never answered. After the Satisfactie van Haarlem in 1577, the books of all the monasteries and cloisters in Haarlem were given to the Latin school and the rector Cornelis Schonaeus (1540‚Äì1611) took two weeks to draw up the inventory list. This same Schonaeus was the one who was in charge of moving the school from the schoolsteeg to the current location in 1583.Schonaeus in the KNAW He almost lost his job when the council decided to start a collegie or university there, but perhaps because Leiden had already been founded, this never happened. He did complete a major reorganization of the school that was then placed in the hands of his successor, Theodorus Schrevelius. During the years 1864-1875 and again from 1925‚Äì1933, the school merged with the Hogere Burger School (Haarlem), due to a decrease in enrollment. The Stedelijk Gymnasium Haarlem was the last school in the Netherlands where lessons were taught on Saturday mornings. This was finally discontinued in the school year 2000-2001. The Prinsenhof itself is a historic Hortus Medicus, that used to contain medicinal herbs tended by the students, but is now a grassy garden - with a weeping beech in the middle - tended by the city parks service. A historic statue to Laurens Janszoon Coster that was originally located on the city square, was moved here in 1823 to make way for a new one. Also located in the hortus is a small \\"peace temple\\" that was originally placed in 1648 to commemorate the Peace of M√ºnster. Campus The campus is located in the old city center of Haarlem. The Latin School occupies two separate building on opposite sides of the Prinsenhof in Haarlem. This arrangement means that public space is a large part of school life. The complex built in 1865 by J.E. van den Arend is restored recently. Haarlem Model United Nations The Latin School of Haarlem hosts an annual Model United Nations conference which is organised by the Haarlem Model United Nations Organisation: the Haarlem Model United Nations Conference (HMUN). The Haarlem Model United Nations Organisation is a nonprofit organization run by students of the Stedelijk Gymnasium Haarlem and the Board of Directors. The Haarlem MUN conference is a three-day conference during which students from schools in the Netherlands and other countries are assigned delegations consisting of countries or non- governmental organizations that they will represent during the conference. They do so in various councils and assemblies, similar to the ones of the real United Nations. In accordance with the policy of their assigned country or non-governmental organizations the students are involved in lobbying, debating, writing resolutions, and all things normally done by adult diplomats.

Today, the major part of its area is dedicated to the Vienna General Hospital. The name Michelbeuern can be traced back to the Benedictine monastery of Michelbeuren in Salzburg. Its possessions in the Vienna area were mentioned in 1072 as Hof zu Waring. They comprised vineyards, meadows and forests mainly located in the area of today's W√§hring. In 1704, the construction of the Linienwall (the city fortifications that preceded today's G√ºrtel ringroad), the current area of Michelbeuren was separated from the W√§hring and was integrated into Alservorstadt. Apart from the Linienwall in the west, the area was confined by the river Als in the south and W√§hring river in the north. During ecclesial reforms under Joseph II., the monastic possessions were ceded to the city of Vienna for 10,000 guilders. The area remained sparsely developed until the mid-19th century. The Br√ºnnlbad baths and Br√ºnnlm√ºhle mill were located at the Als river (today's Lazarettgasse). The north housed a Vienna toll office (Verzehrungssteuer-Linienamt) while the center served mainly for brick production. In 1836, the steam engine producer k.k. privilegierte Dampfmaschinenfabrik AG was founded in Eisengasse (today's Wilhelm-Exner-Gasse). In 1848-1853, the elevated area of Michelbeuern saw the construction of the psychiatric institution Nieder√∂sterreichische Landesirrenanstalt by architect Ferdinand Fellner. The building continued to serve this purpose until it was demolished in 1974 in order to make space for the new buildings of Vienna General Hospital.

Benedetto Pistrucci's St. George design The Great Recoinage of 1816 was an attempt by the British Government to re- stabilise the currency of Great Britain following economic difficulties precipitated by the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars.A New history of the Royal Mint. Christopher Edgar Challis Background The French Revolutionary Wars (1792‚Äì1802) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815) led to financial instability in Britain. This was due to direct military and economic warfare against France as well as Britain's financing of a series of coalitions opposed to the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic regimes. In exchange for large cash subsidies from Britain, nations such as Austria, Prussia and Russia, with armies larger than Britain's, were paid to fight against France. The economic conflicts of that era (such as Napoleon's Continental System and Britain's retaliatory measures against it) especially disrupted trade and the availability of markets in Europe for the products of Britain's growing mercantile and colonial empires. A shortage of silver and copper led to a shortage of coins. Paper money became legal in 1797Paper against gold, or, the mystery of the Bank of England. William Cobbett. 1846. and local tokens were produced by companies and banks all over the country. Despite an increase in trade, the national debt had increased by 100% by the start of the 19th century. A series of bad harvests pushed up food prices and this culminated in riots in 1801‚Äì2. Corn prices halved at the end of the wars, when trade with Europe resumed. The Corn Laws of 1815 were intended to protect the price of domestic grain, but this only served to keep prices high and depressed the domestic market for manufactured goods, because people had to use all their money to buy food.Bright, J. and Thorold Rogers, J.E. (eds.) [1870](1908) Speeches on Questions of Public Policy by Richard Cobden, M.P., Vol. 1, London: T. Fisher Unwin, republished as Cobden, R. (1995), London: Routledge/Thoemmes, Likewise, European countries which relied on exporting corn to Britain in order to buy British manufactured goods were no longer able to do so. The government needed to find a way to stabilise the currency, and the Great Recoinage was the first step in this process. The main aims were the reintroduction of a silver coinage and a change in the gold coinage from the guinea valued at 21 shillings to the slightly lighter sovereign worth 20 shillings.The British almanac. Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain) 1856 The value of the shilling remained unchanged at twelve pence.The Coinage of Britain. Ken Elks This massive recoinage programme by the Royal Mint created standard gold sovereigns and circulating crowns and half- crowns containing the now famous image of St. George & the Dragon by the Italian engraver Benedetto PistrucciA New history of the Royal Mint. Christopher Edgar Challis and eventually copper farthings in 1821. Pistrucci's initial portrait of the King has become known to collectors as the \\"bull-head George\\". Specifications The weight of the new gold sovereigns was calculated on the basis that the value of one troy pound of standard (22 carat) gold was ¬£46 14s 6d. Sovereigns therefore in theory weighed 123.2744783 grains or 7.988030269 grams, although this implies much more precision than it was possible to achieve with the technology of the time. This standard persists to the present day, more than two centuries later. To put a gold standard into effect, and avoid the pitfalls of bimetallism, silver coins were declared legal tender only for sums of money up to ¬£2. The recoinage of silver in England after a long drought produced a burst of coins: the mint struck nearly 40 million shillings between 1816 and 1820, 17 million half-crowns and 1.3 million silver crowns.Report from the Select Committee on the Royal Mint: together with the minutes of evidence, appendix and index, Volume 2 (Great Britain. Committee on Royal Mint, 1849), p. 172. The value of one troy pound (weighing 5760 grains) of standard (0.925 fine) silver was fixed by coining it into 66 shillings (or its equivalent in other denominations). This established the weight of all silver coins (and their cupro-nickel successors), and their decimal new pence replacements, from 1816 until the 1990s, when new smaller coins were introduced. The silver coins initially produced were shillings weighing 87.2727 grains (or 5.655 grams), half-crowns of 218.1818 grains (14.138 grams) and crowns of 436.3636 grains (28.276 grams). Over the many reigns until decimalisation other denominations came and went, such as the threepence, sixpence, florin, and double florin, always weighing exactly one troy pound per 66 shillings (irrespective of fineness, which was reduced to 50% in 1920, and to 0% in 1947). This made 5 sterling silver shillings (which is 1 crown), about the weight of .9091 troy ounce of sterling silver.

World Boxing Federation world title and IBF International title shot Alessandro Riguccini is proclaimed boxing World champion by Tony Weeks On 22 April 2017 he had the opportunity to become also a boxing world champion. He faced expert Jesus Antonio Rios who came to the match with a record of 36 wins (of which 29 per KO) 9 defeats, 1 pair and a No-Contest against the 16 (all won, 12 per KO) of Riguccini. The match began with difficulties for Riguccini, which on the cards after two rounds was equal to two judges (19-19) and two points for the third judge (18-20). Towards the middle of the 3rd round, he succeeded with a right-back shot of Rios, which allowed him to score a series of shots at Rios's defeat, which forced the referee (Tony Weeks) to interrupt the match and deliver the two titles to Riguccini that won for technical KO. Future career in Mexico Less than a month away from the boxing lightweight world title, Riguccini decided to return to the ring in a 10 rounds match in which he faces the Mexican Jesus Valenzuela at the Guasave Score Bar in Sinaloa while knocking him out in the second round. On 2 June he returned to the ring in Sinaloa and beat Mexican boxer Christian Valverde for KO in the second round bringing his score to 19-0 with 15 KOs Alessandro Riguccini vs Edgar Puerta On 25 November 2017 he tackled former two times WBC world silver champion Edgar Puerta in a 10-round no-title match, winning by second-round knockout after being knocked out in the first round.

WBC World Silver welterweight title On 27 October 2018 he won the welterweight world WBC silver title against the undefeated Andres Villaman (14-0, 10KOs) bringing his record to 22 wins (18 KOs) and no defeats and thus becoming world champion boxing and kickboxing in globally recognized federations (respectively WBC and Wako Pro). The WBC World silver belt won by Alessandro Riguccini WBC World Silver welterweight title defense On 26 April 2019 he successfully defended the WBC Silver world welterweight title against the Mexican Ivan Alvarez Ruiz at the Tuscany Hall in Florence. Riguccini immediately strikes the liver with a straight left first and the Mexican heavily accuses. Riguccini realizes it and immediately closes it on the ropes unloading fast and powerful blows and making Alvarez count for three times that at the third count he is definitively stopped by TKO. Alessandro Riguccini and his trainer Fernando Fernandez in Tijuana Second WBC World Silver welterweight title defense On 26 October 2019 he successfully defended for the second time the WBC Silver welterweight world title he held against Venezuelan Juan Ruiz at the Plaza de Toros in Cancun, Mexico. The match begins so hard for Riguccini that finds in difficult to get a target while hitting the high Venezuelan. In the second round, however, he managed to hit Ruiz repeatedly, who suffered further body blows in the third round and did not respond to the bell of round number four. Later it will be ascertained that the withdrawal was due to the rupture of one of the ribs in the left side.https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/bouts/459845-lubin-vs- gausha-alessandro-rognoso-riguccini-vs-juan-el-nino-ruiz Championships and accomplishments Professional boxing * WBC World Silver welterweight Champion (2 title defenses) * World Boxing Federation World lightweight Championhttp://www.saturnonotizie.it/news/leggi/106429/Alessandro-.html * IBF International lightweight Champion * WBC FECARBOX super featherweight Champion. * April 2017 World Boxing Federation \\"Boxer of the month\\" Professional Kickboxing *Kickboxing ** Wako Pro kickboxing World lightweight -62.2 kg Champion ** Wako Pro full contact World middleweight -71.8 kg champion ** WKA K1 World super lightweight -63.5 kg champion(2 Title Defences 2014,2016). ** Kombat League kickboxing World super welterweight -69.9 kg champion ** IKTA K1 World super lightweight -63.5 kg champion(2 Title Defences) ** WMMAF full contact International super welterweight -69.9 kg champion ** Wako Pro kickboxing World welterweight -66.8 kg championship runner up *Sanda **CKA sanda 2006 Italian champion -70 kg **CKA sanda 2007 Italian champion -70 kg Amateur Kickboxing *Sanda **CKA sanda 2005 super welterweight Italian junior championship Gold -65 kg **FIWuK sanda 2006 super welterweight Italian championship Gold -70 kg **FIWuK sanda 2007 super welterweight Italian championship Gold -70 kg **CKA sanda 2006 super welterweight World championship Silver -70 kg Professional Boxing Record style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"|24 Wins (20 knockouts), 0 Defeat, 0 Draws |- style=\\"text-align:center;

In April 2017 it was ranked as the third best high school in Vermont and at number 893 in the nation. MMU has also been cited by BusinessWeek as being the \\"best high school in Vermont\\" and \\"among the best in New England\\", based on academic performance and standardized test scores. Curriculum Language is not required for graduation from MMU, but since most students go to college or some other form of higher education, it is common to take at least two years of a foreign language. MMU offers Spanish, Latin, and French. Although only these are offered on campus, students may obtain credits through online courses or other local campuses, including that of the University of Vermont. Students also have the option of attending Essex Technical Center or Burlington Technical Center. Math levels at MMU are slightly different from usual. The levels after basic math are Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, and Pre-Calculus, whereas most schools have Algebra 2 before Geometry. The school has chosen to do this because of the use of geometry on the standardized tests that MMU juniors take. The school uses a 4.33 GPA scale.

Jazz musicians born that year included Peggy Lee, Dave Bartholomew and Dave Brubeck. Overview of Jazz in 1920 Throughout much of the 1920s, the Chicago jazz scene was developing rapidly, aided by the migration of over 40 prominent New Orleans jazz men, including the New Orleans Rhythm Kings who began playing at Friar's Inn. Additionally, following prohibition in 1920, the cabaret business began in New York City and the growing number of speakeasies developing in cellars provided many aspiring jazz musicians with new venues. This gradually saw many musicians who had moved to Chicago ending up on the east coast. Meanwhile, classic blues and symphonic jazz were becoming more and more prominent as additional sub genres of jazz to consider. Culture Surrounding Jazz in 1920 The birth of a more urban and industrialized America was in part marked by the new style of music: jazz (Drowne 3). Leading up to 1920, America was becoming much more industrialized which led to the decade starting off with many strikes across different fields. However, as the decade progressed, the number of those in labor unions steadily decreased. Meanwhile, just before 1920, a racial division began to emerge between black workers and the veterans they replaced during World War 1. During this time, many blacks trying to get out of rural poverty moved north to big, bustling cities such as Chicago and New York City. Unfortunately, racial segregation and invasions of black neighborhood by whites led to many race riots in 1919. As prohibition led to many entertainment businesses expanding to include live music performances, it opened the door for many black jazz musicians to gain a following (Ogren 5). Allowing jazz to rise up in American culture brought many unique things to music in 1920. New instrumental, orchestral, and rhythmic techniques were introduced, as well as twelve-bar blues, emotional expressiveness, a new scale, and unique forms (Murchison 98). In 1917, many jazz record companies began to conceal their identity because racial tension was on the rise and showed no signs of slowing down. This allowed them to overcome identity threats such as their association with illegitimate, but profitable products (Phillips and Kim 481).  The Jazz Debate in 1920  ‚ÄúOne can plausibly argue that the debate over jazz was just one of many that characterized American social discourse in the 1920s‚Äù (Ogren 3). In 1919, jazz was being described to white people as ‚Äúa music originating about the turn of the twentieth century in New Orleans that featured wind instruments exploiting new timbres and performance techniques and improvisation‚Äù (Murchison 97). On the other hand, famous jazz musician Jelly Roll Morton said jazz is centered around melody, rhythm, and harmony. While white people often saw jazz as nothing more than syncopation and technique, black jazz musicians argued that improvisation and harmony are just as important. In addition to this, although jazz has mostly black roots, most people associate it today with white musicians (Dupree 288).  Jazz in Chicago  By 1920, the African American population in Chicago was up to 109,594 out of 2,701,705 total residents (Absher 17). As African American culture in Chicago grew, so did racial segregation (Absher 19). This resulted in many black jazz musicians in 1920 having to defend their music against people who were trying to run them out of popular music and entertainment venues. After racially motivated violence broke out in Chicago in 1919, the local government created the Chicago Commission on Race Relations to hopefully help with the animosity between white people and black people in the city (Absher 30). In the midst of this rising racial tension, job opportunities for the majority of the black community became limited. Because many black people had previous experience playing musical instruments as a child, playing in nightclubs and other entertainment venues was proven to be one of the only options.  Race Relating to Jazz in 1920  Despite the racial indifference that stemmed from jazz in the United States, white people were quickly catching onto the fact that this new music style wasn‚Äôt going anywhere and would eventually just have to be accepted and embraced (Anderson 135). Many white critics in 1920 would often refer to black jazz musicians as ‚Äúsavages‚Äù instead of musical artists and put down the genre altogether by saying that jazz was ‚Äústrict rhythm without melody‚Äù (Anderson 136). Because jazz had caused so much segregation and tension between people living in big, urbanized cities, Chicago soon became a city of intense disconnect (Phillips 428). Births George Handy, ca.

According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2019, he is worth ¬£612 million. He is nicknamed 'Spotty'. The Rowland family is an investment adviser to Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Early life David Rowland was born in 1945 to the family of a scrap metal dealer.  Business activities  Rowland established Fordham Investment Group in 1965. In 1970, he sold his stake in Fordham for ¬£2.4 million, and moved to France. In 1970s, he took control of the shipping company Williams Hudson and the timber group Venesta International through Argo Caribbean Group Limited, a Bahamian company controlled by the trustees of a Rowland's family settlement. In 1989, Rowland acquired 34% interest in Idaho-based Gulf Resources & Chemical Corporation from the Barclay brothers. A controlling stake was bought through a property company Inoco Plc., which was controlled by a Panama-based company, Monaco Group Fund S.A., an entity which was at that time governed by \\"trustees of settlements whose beneficiaries are Rowland and his children\\". Rowland himself became CEO of Gulf Resources. In 1991, Inoco sold its stake to Nycal Corporation. Over the following years, Gulf resorted to the American courts to recover company monies they alleged were spent by David Rowland, firstly via the courts and then via their insurance company. One case was settled (though no financial settlement was deemed necessary), while Gulf lost another. In 2009, Kaupthing Bank Luxembourg, affected by the global liquidity squeeze, was divided into two new entities, a 'good, healthy' bank, later renamed Banque Havilland, and a 'bad' bank. David Rowland and his son Jonathan, via their investment company Blackfish Capital, acquired and recapitalized the former and now manage the assets, on behalf of the interbank creditors, of the latter. Redwood Financial Partners, a company controlled by David Rowland and his son Jonathan Rowland, own Redwood Bank, which became operational in 2017. At the same year, David Rowland and his son Edmund Rowland, through their investment company Staunton Holdings Ltd, made a takeover bid for the Falkland Islands-based FIH group. The takeover failed and their stake in the company was sold. According to the Panama Papers, Rowland also owned offshore companies Asherton Ltd, Binbrook Ltd, Coalburn Ltd, and Docking Ltd, among others. Football issues In 1988, Rowland helped fund a lawyer, David Duff, in a failed takeover of Edinburgh Hibernian, parent company of Scottish Premier Division football club Hibernian. Eventually the company went into receivership. In 2013, Rowland- owned Fordham Sports Management Ltd. acquired Manchester City's top players' image rights.  Conservative Party  In the year before the 2010 United Kingdom general election, Rowland donated ¬£2.8m to the Conservative Party, making him the party's major donor. In 2010, he was announced as being the next Treasurer of the Conservative Party. After this announcement, the Daily Mail published a series of articles that were critical of him. After public criticism of his former status as a tax exile, Rowland resigned before taking the position. Rowland had lived in Guernsey, but returned to full United Kingdom residency in order to make donations to the Conservatives. Electoral law in the United Kingdom prohibits foreign donations to political parties. In August 2010, Rowland made another donation of ¬£1 million to the Conservative Party.The Time ‚Äì David Rowland gives more than 1m to Conservative Party ‚Äì 27 August 2010 In May 2017, he gave ¬£200,000 to the Conservative Party. Personal life Rowland moved from London to Paris at the age of 24, then Monte Carlo, Monaco, and finally Guernsey, where he has lived since at least 2005. He lives at Havilland Hall, the largest privately owned estate on the island, where in 2005, Prince Andrew unveiled a life-size bronze statue of Rowland smoking a cigar in a \\"vaguely Churchillian pose\\".

RII is useful because it takes into account the size of the population and the relative disadvantage experienced by different groups. The disease outcome is regressed on the proportion of the population that has a higher position in the hierarchy. The RII is particularly valuable when comparing risk factors (independent variables) that are on very different scales (e.g. low SES, low IQ, cigarette smoking). The RII is calculated in the following way: # Rank cases on each of the variables # For tied ranks and for categorical variables, assign the mean rank # Divide the ranks by the sample size, creating a value ranging from 0 to 1  Interpretation of RII  The interpretation of RII is similar to the relative risk. It summarizes the relative risk for the most advantaged group (at the top of the hierarchy) compared to the least advantaged group (at the bottom of the hierarchy). This interpretation assumes that the variables have been scored so that higher scores are consistent with increased risk. For example, an RII of 1.88 (95% confidence intervals 1.27 to 2.77), an indicator of low SES, on the risk of long term illness, implies that those in the most deprived group are 1.88 times more likely to experience illness than those in the least deprived group.  Limitations of RII  One disadvantage of the RII is that it may capitalize on skewed data, inflating the apparent relative risk. A second limitation is that a large RII may arise for two reasons. First, it may represent a large effect of SES on disease. Second, it may reflect large differences between those with the most SES and those with the least (i.e. large inequalities in SES itself).

Despite the fierce resistance of the French army led by Louis de Bourbon, Count of Soissons, the allied troops successfully crossed the river and drove off the French troops along the Oise river, proceeding over the following weeks to invest the important fortress of Corbie, located two leagues upriver of Amiens, which caused a spread of panic among the population of Paris. Background Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, Governor of the Low Countries, attributed to Justus Sustermans. Shortly after France declared the war on Spain in May 1635, a French army under the Marshals of France Urbain de Maill√©-Br√©z√© and Gaspard III de Coligny, allied with the Dutch States Army, invaded the Spanish Netherlands from two sides and threatened Brussels before investing Leuven.Israel, p. 69 The siege ended in a costly failure because of bad logistics and organization, and as the French army was decimated by the plague. The Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, governor of the Spanish Netherlands, counterattacked and expelled the invaders, concentrating his resources against the Dutch over the following months.Israel, p. 70‚Äì71 The recapture by the statholder Frederick Henry of Orange of the key fortress of Schenkenschans did not discouraged the Spanish, and the Count-Duke of Olivares continued determined to concentrate the war effort against the Dutch.Israel, p. 72 After suffer further defeats against the armies of the Duke Charles of Lorraine and the Imperial generalissimo Matthias Gallas in the Rhine, Alsace and Lorraine, the French armies remained focused in the defense and reconquest of strategic places in these territories.Parrott, p. 118 The conquest of the Franche-Comt√©, entrusted to Henri de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√© and Charles de La Porte de La Meilleraye, soon became an absolute priority to the Cardinal Richelieu. The Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, whose position in Germany had strengthened since the Peace of Prague, meanwhile, projected an invasion of the eastern France under Matthias Gallas, but as logistical and financial problems diminished his force, he proposed a joint invasion to the Cardinal- Infante.Israel, p. 74 Philip IV of Spain and Olivares rapidly agreed. A lightly equipped army ranging from 10,000‚Äì12,000 infantry and 13,000 cavalry soldiers to 18,000 soldiers of both types, including an imperialist contingent under Ottavio Piccolomini was gathered at Mons during June. On 4 July the Cardinal-Infante crossed the frontier via Avesnes and took the fortresses of Le Catelet and La Capelle.Israel, p. 76 Though having large garrisons, La Capelle surrendered after only four days of siege and Le Catelet, one of the strongest fortresses of France, after three days thanks to the exploding shells used by the Spanish army, a recent innovation yet unfamiliar to the French. The alarming advance of the Cardinal-Infante forced Louis XIII to return to Paris from Fontainebleau. By then Ferdinand was in Cambrai and had left the command of his army to the Prince Thomas Francis of Carignano, the commander of the Army of Flanders.Vincart, p. 24 Battle Contemporary portrait of Louis de Bourbon, Count of Soissons. The Prince of Carignano took over the army and headed to Saint Quentin with the aim of continue the invasion and attract Louis de Bourbon, Count of Soissons, who was in Picardy in command of a force of 14,000 soldiers, and his army to the town. Having arrived at the fields in front of Saint Quentin, the Prince changed the route of the army and advanced towards the Somme river. The Cardinal Infante sent to him don Esteban de Gamarra, a gentleman in his confidence, to transmit the order to cross the Somme at the village Bray-sur-Somme or at an easier place even if the French armies were guarding the riverside. Pontoons and boats were dispatched from Cambrai for this purpose.Vincart, p. 25 Portrait of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano. The Prince put on alert his Maestres de Campo and Colonels and set route to Bray. On 4 August his troops occupied a small island in middle of the river and soon a skirmish began with the French troops on the other riverside. The Count of Soissons, who were stationed with his troops on a nearby hill, believed that the Spanish were attempting to cross the river in that place and detached its battalions and squadrons near the riverside to reject every attempt.Michaud/Poujoulat, p. 254 The Marquis of Fontenay, who led these troops, set fire to the village and entrenched his soldiers in a series of forts built in the riverside. The skirmish continued a long time with artillery and musketry fire. According to the French, only 20 of his soldiers were killed, among them the Comte de Matha, captain of a company of the R√©giment des Gardes. The Prince ordered his Tercios of Spaniards march to the village of Cerisy, located a league south of Bray, and cross there the river. A pontoon bridge was promptly tended from one bank to the opposite, and large amounts of s previously prepared were spread on the marshy land to facilitate the crossing of the soldiers.Vincart, p. 25‚Äì26 Only the R√©giment de Piedmont was in that place to confront the Spaniards. These formed in squadron at the riverside and became involved in a stubborn fight that lasted for three hours.Vincart, p. 26 The R√©giment de Piedmont, reinforced by a company of the R√©giment des Gardes, tried to expel them from the pontoons and the road of faggots with great fierceness, but thanks to the presence of the Prince, who took the command of the attack, the Spaniards managed to cross the river and drove off the R√©giment de Piemont from the riverside. The Maestro de Campo Alonso P√©rez de Vivero y Menchaca, Count of Fuensalda√±a, put then his soldiers to work in the digging of trenches to cover them from a possible counterattack.Vincart, p. 26‚Äì27 The Spanish artillery and some musketeers riddled the forest where the R√©giment de Piedmont had sought coverage and forced the few surviving troops to retreat leaving behind about 700-800 corpses.Vincart, p. 27 The Prince lost that day around 35 soldiers killed and 50 wounded.Vincart, p. 28 The French losses could have been higher if the Spanish cavalry had crossed the river in time to pursue them, but this did not happen and Soissons was able to withdraw his troops in good order. Aftermath Johann von Werth as burgrave (governor) of Odenkirchen, oil on canvas. Portrait of Ottavio Piccolomini by Anselm van Hulle, Collezione Luca Cristini The Prince of Carignano, searching the destruction of the retreating French army, dispatched Ottavio Piccolomini in command of his cavalry and Johann von Werth with the Spanish cavalry behind the Count of Soissons, who was forced to pass the Oise river. The harassment of the German and Spanish cavalry diminished the strength of the French army, finding the Imperial- Spanish troops abandoned corpses and weapons at his advance. Piccolomini's persecution of the retreating French army lead him to Roye, which he captured and from where he reached Compi√®gne and advanced further into French territory, which caused consternation in Paris. Meanwhile, Soissons retreated to Noyon pursued by Johann von Werth. The Bavarian general destroyed 5 French cavalry regiments near the town, but he had not enough forces to attempt its capture.Vincart, p. 29 On 7 August the Prince of Carignano, by orders of the Cardinal-Infante, surrounded the vital fortress of Corbie, which surrendered to him a week later. The following day Louis XIII wrote to the Prince of Cond√© ordering him to abandon the siege of D√¥le and to withdraw from the Franche- Comt√© to help defend Paris. At the French court it was believed that after Corbie the Spanish would advance further into France.Israel, p. 77 Piccolomini, who wanted to do so, tried to persuade the Cardinal-Infante. The Cardinal-Infante felt that more ambitious operations could risk his army and resolved to retreat. He was back in Cambrai in early September, before Matthias Gallas' invasion of France had begun, and the French armies regained most of the lost ground over the following months.Israel, p. 78 Notes References   Category:Battles of the Thirty Years' War Category:Battles involving the Holy Roman Empire Category:Battles involving Spain Category:Battles involving France Category:Battles in Hauts-de-France Category:Conflicts in 1636 Category:1636 in France Crossing ","title":"Crossing of the Somme"},{"id":"29854917","text":"Red Lion Chambers is a UK set of barristers' chambers, specialising in criminal law, formerly known as 18 Red Lion Court.

The Peries family was a Roman Catholic family that had become anglicized. Ivan was fluent in English from childhood.  Training and early work  Ivan Peries leant towards art as a vocation from a young age, and was a recognised artist by the age of 20.Richard Gabriel, 'Reminiscences'. He refused his parents‚Äô offer to take an academic university degree. Photographer Lionel Wendt recommended Harry Pieris as Ivan‚Äôs teacher. Harry Pieries became mentor and friend to Ivan. In 1941 Wendt bought Peries‚Äô ‚ÄòHomage to El Greco‚Äô. Ivan Peries was part of a community of progressive, intellectual Sri-Lankan artists. They included Justin Daraniyagala, George Keyt, Aubrey Collette, George Claessen, WJG Beling, LTP Manjusri, Richard Gabriel, Walter Witharne, and YJ Thuring. His character at this time was ‚Äòexcited and tense, [acting] on the spur of the moment‚Äô.Richard Gabriel, 'Reminiscences' In the early 1940s he was ‚Äòfrantically engaged in a shuttle service, meeting one artist or another ‚Äì Harry, Beling, Collette. He went all the way to Nugedola to meet Justin, then back to Lionel Wendt, who was respected by all‚Äô. In 1943, Wendt orchestrated a meeting of the artists along with Harry Pieris, with Ivan doing ‚Äòthe spade work‚Äô. These few Sri Lankan artists named themselves the '43 Group, after the year. They admired other such groups as the Surrealists and wanted recognition for a style of painting that had many influences but few restrictions, such as had been imposed on them by the Ceylonese Society of Arts. In 1946 Peries won a government scholarship to the St John's Wood School of Art in London, to train for a further 4 years. During this time he produced a number of panel studies, mainly portraits, figures and nudes. He returned to Sri Lanka in 1949, and painted ‚ÄòThe Bathers‚Äô, hinting at C√©zanne. British diplomat Martin Russell was patron to the 43 Group from its inception, buying all works exhibited by Keyt in one exhibition, and many works by Ivan Peries in the 1940s, financing his flat in London during the scholarship on the condition that Russell have first call on any paintings Peries sold.http://www.lesternsumitra.com , Ivan's biography  London  Ivan moved to England's capital in 1953. The following years saw the production of three major paintings: The Wave (1955), The Return (1956) and The Arrival (1959‚Äì60). Professor Qadri Ismail postulates that: ‚ÄòThe problem with Ivan Peries was that he could not be dismissed with a convenient critical phrase or be put out of the way with an easy tag. He was mercurial and so too did his work have that quality. Until the last years of his life‚Ä¶[his] paintings had the air of a whim or fancy‚Ä¶All sorts of things stimulated his imagination: color‚Ä¶shapes‚Ä¶mystery, as in the deep forebodings of the sea and the rumblings of a monsoon equally full of awe, as in the painting known as The Return. There is stark realism in the anxiety with which the family awaits the return of the men gone out to sea.‚Äô'Ivan Peries and the Outriggers to Association', by Professor Qadri Ismail, Art Sri Lanka (www.artsrilanka.org) Looking through Ivan‚Äôs process in these works, according to Prof. Ashley Halpe, ‚Äògives one a richer sense of the complexity of cultural being in a post colonial context and helps to define the heroism of the artist‚Äôs triumph over disjuncture and psychic disturbance, enhancing, if that were possible, the capacity of the paintings.‚Äô  Later years  Ivan and his wife Veronica (n√©e) Perry (m. 1955) settled in Southend-on-Sea, with their four children. Professor Senake Bandaranayake considered Peries' later work: ‚Äòthe product of a purely painterly meditation on the painter's indigenous experience. His mature work displays that fine control over feeling and technique that is present in all his work. Influences have already been completely absorbed and digested; they are operative as far as the entire convention of landscape within which the picture exists. Now in his full maturity, yet sufficiently removed in time to have absorbed and digested his experience, Peries has completely mastered his vision and his material.‚ÄôIvan Peries: the 43 Group, Art Sri Lanka (www.artsrilanka.org)  Influences  ‚ÄòLike every painter, Peries learned from others: Piero della Francesca, Angelico and El Greco, Matisse, C√©zanne and many more', say Senake Bandaranayake and Manel Fonseka in their essential account;'Ivan Peries Paintings, 1938-88', Prof. Senake Bandaranayake and Manel Fonseca, Tamarind Publications, Columbo, 1996 and even from some who didn‚Äôt paint, like Lionel Wendt, postulated Professor Qadri Ismail.'Ivan Peries and the Outriggers to Association', Prof. Qadri Ismail.

The new facility is scheduled to host the final of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Construction officially began on 11 April 2017. Its final design was unveiled in December 2018.  Design  The stadium was designed by British firm Foster + Partners, who received support from MANICA Architecture specializing in sport design. In the construction phase, KEO Consultants provided design services to the Contractor as part of its Design & Build. KEO were replaced in 2018. The design includes an almost circular base and will be surrounded by a moat and be connected to the car park by six bridges. The stadium has a near-circular footprint and sits on the masterplan's primary axis, which divides the stadium precinct into two halves. Encircled by a reflective pool of water, spectators cross the 'moat' to enter the building via six bridges. An outer pedestrian concourse extends from the water towards an array of smaller amenity buildings and a hotel at the stadium's perimeter. The British designers sought to mirror the ancient Arab craft of bowl weaving in the stadium's inner structure. The saddle-form roof appears to float above the concrete seating bowl, discreetly supported by a ring of arching columns. Its central section can be retracted to allow the pitch to be either open to the sky or fully covered. The concave profile of the stadium's outer enclosure evokes the sails of a traditional dhow boat and incorporates a system of operable louvres. Inside, the seating bowl is designed to enhance the experience and atmosphere for spectators: VIP and hospitality accommodation is concentrated along the sides of the pitch to create a continuous sea of fans behind each goal. Located in the centre of a new development to the north of Doha, with direct connections by road and a new metro line, Lusail Iconic Stadium is intended to be a catalyst for development growth of Lusail city. Parking and service areas are shaded by canopies of solar collectors, which will produce energy for the stadium when it is in use, as well as generating power for neighbouring buildings. Following the World Cup, it is expected to be reconfigured into a 40,000-seat stadium. Excess seating will be removed, and other parts of the building repurposed as a community space with shops, caf√©s, athletic and education facilities, and a health clinic.

Life and political activity Shotemur was born on December 1, 1899 in Shughnon District, Tajikistan, to a poor farmer family. At the age of 13 Shotemur started assisting his family on the field. From 1914 to 1918 he worked at a factory in Tashkent. In 1921 he began pursuing a political career and was sent back to the Pamirs as a member of the political-military team. From 1923 to 1924 he worked as an instructor of the national minorities department of Tajikistan's Communist Party Central Committee. At the same time he headed the Tajik communist section. During his lifetime Shirinsho Shotemur held many leading positions in the Tajik government and in the communist party. In 1937 Shotemur was charged with participation in an anti-Soviet nationalistic organization and arrested in Moscow. Later the same year the Military board of the Supreme Court of the USSR sentenced Shotemur to death. He was executed on October 27, 1937. In 1956 Shotemur was posthumously rehabilitated by Military board of the Supreme Court of the USSR.Wikipedia, Russian: –®–∏—Ä–∏–Ω—à–æ –®–æ—Ç–µ–º–æ—Ä Contribution to history Statue of Shirinsho Shotemur in Khorugh Shirinsho Shotemur was one of the main initiators of establishing the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924. As of 1927 Shotemur was the Tajik ASSR's representative in the Uzbek SSR. In 1929, Shirinsho Shotemur successfully insisted on joining Sughd Province to the Tajik ASSR. The same year he initiated the exit of Tajikistan from the Uzbek SSR and the establishment of the new Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. Many Soviet historians believe that his initiatives to separate Tajikistan from the Uzbek SSR caused his rivals to falsify charges against Shotemur, which led to his death sentence. Shirinsho Shotemur was awarded with prestigious state awards during his lifetime, as well as posthumously, including awards from the Republic of Tajikistan in 1999 and 2006. Family In 1930 Shirinsho Shotemur married Alexandra Mikhailovna Kiselyova, who had recently moved to Tajikistan. Shotemur has two sons - Shirinsho Jr. (1931), and Rustam (1936). After Shirinsho's arrest in 1937, his wife was sent off to political prisoners' family camp in Siberia. His children, who were at their grandparents house at the time of arrest, grew up with Alexandra's mother. In 1940 the boys received a letter from their mother, in which she wrote in a coded language that she would return. However, on the way home she was detained again and sent to Krasnoyarsk. Even after her final return in 1944 Alexandra was not allowed to live with her children. Later the same year she died. For political reasons Shirinsho Shotemur Jr. faced problems entering a university after school. Soon a friend helped the family to change his younger brother's name to Rustam Arturovich Avotyn to avoid further problems. Shotemur Sr.'s other family members in Tajik SSR were also subject to repression. Thus, Shirinsho Jr. and Rustam had no contact with their Tajik relatives until their father's name was officially rehabilitated.

The process worked only for a few cycles and then became inefficient. Two students of Boussingault, Quentin and Arthur Leon Brin, discovered that traces of carbon dioxide formed barium carbonate. Removing the carbon dioxide with sodium hydroxide solved this problem. In 1884 they opened a factory producing oxygen by their improved process. In the commercial process, oxygen capture and release was controlled by pressure rather than temperature, with oxygen being captured at high pressure and released at low pressure. This allowed a faster change between the capture and release phases, which would last one to two hours. The company was first named after the two brothers Brins Oxygen Company in 1906 it was renamed Britisch Oxygen Company. One major application of the oxygen was the use for limelight.

This pattern is general for other related elements, including selenium, which can exhibit both beneficial and deleterious effects. Arsenic biochemistry has become topical since many toxic arsenic compounds are found in some aquifers, potentially affecting many millions of people via biochemical processes.Elke Dopp, Andrew D. Kligerman and Roland A. Diaz-Bone Organoarsenicals. Uptake, Metabolism, and Toxicity 2010, Royal Society of Chemistry. . Sources of arsenic Organoarsenic compounds in nature Arsenic poisoning is a global problem arising from naturally occurring arsenic in ground water. The evidence that arsenic may be a beneficial nutrient at trace levels below the background to which living organisms are normally exposed has been reviewed. Some organoarsenic compounds found in nature are arsenobetaine and arsenocholine,Arsenocholine - Structure and Data both being found in many marine organisms. Some As-containing nucleosides (sugar derivatives) are also known. Several of these organoarsenic compounds arise via methylation processes. For example, the mold Scopulariopsis brevicaulis produces significant amounts of trimethylarsine if inorganic arsenic is present. The organic compound arsenobetaine is found in some marine foods such as fish and algae, and also in mushrooms in larger concentrations. In clean environments, the edible mushroom species Cyanoboletus pulverulentus hyperaccumulates arsenic in concentrations reaching even 1,300 mg/kg in dry weight; cacodylic acid is the major As compound. A very unusual composition of organoarsenic compounds was found in deer truffles (Elaphomyces spp.). The average person's intake is about 10‚Äì50 ¬µg/day. Values about 1000 ¬µg are not unusual following consumption of fish or mushrooms; however, there is little danger in eating fish since this arsenic compound is nearly non-toxic.

File: Trimethylarsine-2D.png|Trimethylarsine, produced by microbial action on arsenate-derived pigments File: DM- Oxoarsenosugars.png|Arsenic-containing ribose derivatives (R = several groups) A topical source of arsenic are the green pigments once popular in wallpapers, e.g. Paris green. A variety of illness have been blamed on this compound, although its toxicity has been exaggerated. Trimethylarsine, once known as Gosio's gas is an intensely malodorous organoarsenic compound that is commonly produced by microbial action on inorganic arsenic substrates. Arsenic (V) compounds are easily reduced to arsenic (III) and could have served as an electron acceptor on primordial Earth. Lakes that contain a substantial amount of dissolved inorganic arsenic, harbor arsenic-tolerant biota. Incorrect claims of arsenic-based life (phosphorus substitution) Although phosphate and arsenate are structurally similar, there is no evidence that arsenic replaces phosphorus in DNA or RNA. A 2010 experiment involving the bacteria GFAJ-1 that made this claim was refuted by 2012. Anthropogenic arsenic compounds Anthropogenic (man-made) sources of arsenic, like the natural sources, are mainly arsenic oxides and the associated anions. Man-made sources of arsenic, include wastes from mineral processing, swine and poultry farms. For example, many ores, especially sulfide minerals, are contaminated with arsenic, which is released in roasting (burning in air). In such processing, arsenide is converted to arsenic trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures and is released into the atmosphere. Poultry and swine farms make heavy use of the organoarsenic compound roxarsone as an antibiotic in feed. Some wood is treated with copper arsenates as a preservative. The mechanisms by which these sources affect \\"downstream\\" living organisms remains uncertain but are probably diverse. One commonly cited pathway involves methylation. The monomethylated acid, methanearsonic acid (CH3AsO(OH)2), is a precursor to fungicides (tradename Neoasozin) in the cultivation of rice and cotton. Derivatives of phenylarsonic acid (C6H5AsO(OH)2) are used as feed additives for livestock, including 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzenearsonic acid (3-NHPAA or Roxarsone), ureidophenylarsonic acid, and p-arsanilic acid. These applications are controversial as they introduce soluble forms of arsenic into the environment. Arsenic-based drugs Despite, or possibly because of, its long-known toxicity, arsenic-containing potions and drugs have a history in medicine and quackery that continues into the 21st century. Starting in the early 19th century and continuing into the 20th century, Fowler's solution, a toxic concoction of sodium arsenite, was sold. The organoarsenic compound Salvarsan was the first synthetic chemotherapeutic agent, discovered by Paul Ehrlich. The treatment, however, led to many problems causing long lasting health complications.Elschenbroich, C. ‚ÄùOrganometallics‚Äù (2006) Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. Around 1943 it was finally superseded by penicillin. The related drug Melarsoprol is still in use against late-state African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), despite its high toxicity and possibly fatal side effects. Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in certain types of cancer cells, which are normally immortal and can multiply without limit. In combination with all-trans retinoic acid, it is FDA-approved as first-line treatment for promyelocytic leukemia. Methylation of arsenic Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon entering the food chain, are progressively metabolised (detoxified) through a process of methylation. The methylation occurs through alternating reductive and oxidative methylation reactions, that is, reduction of pentavalent to trivalent arsenic followed by addition of a methyl group (CH3). Cacodylic acid, formed in the liver after ingestion of arsenic. In mammals, methylation occurs in the liver by methyltransferases, the products being the (CH3)2AsOH (dimethylarsinous acid) and (CH3)2As(O)OH (dimethylarsinic acid), which have the oxidation states As(III) and As(V), respectively. Although the mechanism of methylation of arsenic in humans has not been elucidated, the source of methyl is methionine, which suggests a role of S-adenosyl methionine. Exposure to toxic doses begin when the liver's methylation capacity is exceeded or inhibited. There are two major forms of arsenic that can enter the body, arsenic (III) and arsenic (V). Arsenic (III) enters the cells though aquaporins 7 and 9, which is a type of aquaglyceroporin. Arsenic (V) compounds use phosphate transporters to enter cells. The arsenic (V) can be converted to arsenic (III) by the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase. This is classified as a bioactivation step, as although arsenic (III) is more toxic, it is more readily methylated. There are two routes by which inorganic arsenic compounds are methylated. The first route uses Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase to methylate arsenic (III) to a mono-methylated arsenic (V) compound. This compound is then converted to a mono-methylated arsenic (III) compound using Glutathione S-Transferase Omega-1 (GSTO1). The mono-methylated arsenic (V) compound can then be methylated again by Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase, which forms a dimethyl arsenic (V) compound, which can be converted to a dimethyl arsenic (III) compound by Glutathione S-Transferase Omega-1 (GTSO1). The other route uses glutathione (GSH) to conjugate with arsenic (III) to form an arsenic (GS) 3 complex. This complex can form a monomethylated arsenic (III) GS complex, using Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase, and this monomethylated GS complex is in equilibrium with the monomethylated arsenic (III). Cyt19 arsenic methyltransferase can methylate the complex one more time, and this forms a dimethylated arsenic GS complex, which is in equilibrium with a dimethyl arsenic (III) complex. Both of the mono-methylated and di-methylated arsenic compounds can readily be excreted in urine. However, the monomethylated compound was shown to be more reactive and more toxic than the inorganic arsenic compounds to human hepatocytes (liver), keratinocytes in the skin, and bronchial epithelial cells (lungs). Studies in experimental animals and humans show that both inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites cross the placenta to the fetus, however, there is evidence that methylation is increased during pregnancy and that it could be highly protective for the developing organism. Enzymatic methylation of arsenic is a detoxification process; it can be methylated to methylarsenite, dimethylarsenite or trimethylarsenite, all of which are trivalent. The methylation is catalyzed by arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT) in mammals, which transfers a methyl group on the cofactor S-adenomethionine (SAM) to arsenic (III). An orthologue of AS3MT is found in bacteria and is called CmArsM. This enzyme was tested in three states (ligand free, arsenic (III) bound and SAM bound). Arsenic (III) binding sites usually use thiol groups of cysteine residues. The catalysis involves thiolates of Cys72, Cys174, and Cys224. In an SN2 reaction, the positive charge on the SAM sulfur atom pulls the bonding electron from the carbon of the methyl group, which interacts with the arsenic lone pair to form an As‚àíC bond, leaving SAH. Excretion In humans, the major route of excretion of most arsenic compounds is via the urine. The biological half-life of inorganic arsenic is about 4 days, but is slightly shorter following exposure to arsenate than to arsenite. The main metabolites excreted in the urine of humans exposed to inorganic arsenic are mono- and dimethylated arsenic acids, together with some unmetabolized inorganic arsenic. The biotransformation of arsenic for excretion is primarily done through the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. Under normal conditions the Nrf2 is bound to Kelch-like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) in its inactive form. With the uptake of arsenic within cells and the subsequent reactions that result in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the Nrf2 unbinds and becomes active. Keap1 has reactive thiol moieties that bind ROS or electrophilic arsenic species such as monomethylted arsenic (III) and induces the release of Nrf2 which then travels through the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The Nrf2 then activates antioxidant responsive element (ARE) as well as electrophilic responsive element (EpRE) both of which contribute in the increase of antioxidant proteins. Of particular note in these antioxidant proteins is heme oxygenase 1 ([HO-1]), NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and Œ≥-glutamylcysteine synthase (Œ≥GCS) which work in conjunction to reduce the oxidative species such as hydrogen peroxide to decrease the oxidative stress upon the cell. The increase in Œ≥GCS causes an increased production of arsenite triglutathionine (As(SG)3) an important adduct that is taken up by either multidrug associated protein 1 or 2 (MRP1 or MRP2) which removes the arsenic out of the cell and into bile for excretion. This adduct can also decompose back into inorganic arsenic. Of particular note in the excretion of arsenic is the multiple methylation steps that take place which may increase the toxicity of arsenic due to MMeAsIII being a potent inhibitor of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and thioredoxin reductase.  Arsenic toxicity  Arsenic is a cause of mortality throughout the world; associated problems include heart, respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, nervous and kidney diseases. Arsenic interferes with cellular longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by NAD+. With the enzyme inhibited, the energy system of the cell is disrupted resulting in a cellular apoptosis episode. Biochemically, arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a clinical picture resembling thiamine deficiency. Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to lactic acidosis. Genotoxicity involves inhibition of DNA repair and DNA methylation. The carcinogenic effect of arsenic arises from the oxidative stress induced by arsenic. Arsenic's high toxicity naturally led to the development of a variety of arsenic compounds as chemical weapons, e.g. dimethylarsenic chloride. Some were employed as chemical warfare agents, especially in World War I. This threat led to many studies on antidotes and an expanded knowledge of the interaction of arsenic compounds with living organisms. One result was the development of antidotes such as British anti-Lewisite. Many such antidotes exploit the affinity of As(III) for thiolate ligands, which convert highly toxic organoarsenicals to less toxic derivatives. It is generally assumed that arsenates bind to cysteine residues in proteins. By contrast, arsenic oxide is an approved and effective chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Toxicity of pentavalent arsenicals Due to its similar structure and properties, pentavalent arsenic metabolites are capable of replacing the phosphate group of many metabolic pathways. The replacement of phosphate by arsenate is initiated when arsenate reacts with glucose and gluconate in vitro. This reaction generates glucose-6-arsenate and 6-arsenogluconate, which act as analogs for glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate. At the substrate level, during glycolysis, glucose-6-arsenate binds as a substrate to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and also inhibits hexokinase through negative feedback. Unlike the importance of phosphate in glycolysis, the presence of arsenate restricts the generation of ATP by forming an unstable anhydride product, through the reaction with D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The anhydride 1-arsenato-3-phospho-D-glycerate generated readily hydrolyzes due to the longer bond length of As-O compared to P-O. At the mitochondrial level, arsenate uncouples the synthesis of ATP by binding to ADP in the presence of succinate, thus forming an unstable compound that ultimately results in a decrease of ATP net gain. Arsenite (III) metabolites, on the other hand, have limited effect on ATP production in red blood cells. Toxicity of trivalent arsenicals Enzymes and receptors that contain thiol or sulfhydryl functional groups are actively targeted by arsenite (III) metabolites. These sulfur-containing compounds are normally glutathione and the amino acid cysteine. Arsenite derivatives generally have higher binding affinity compared to the arsenate metabolites. These bindings restrict activity of certain metabolic pathways. For example, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is inhibited when monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) targets the thiol group of the lipoic acid cofactor. PDH is a precursor of acetyl-CoA, thus the inhibition of PDH eventually limits the production of ATP in electron transport chain, as well as the production of gluconeogenesis intermediates. Oxidative stress Arsenic can cause oxidative stress through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Reactive oxygen species are produced by the enzyme NADPH oxidase, which transfers electrons from NADPH to oxygen, synthesizing a superoxide, which is a reactive free radical. This superoxide can react to form hydrogen peroxide and a reactive oxygen species. The enzyme NADPH oxidase is able to generate more reactive oxygen species in the presence of arsenic, due to the subunit p22phax, which is responsible for the electron transfer, being upregulated by arsenic. The reactive oxygen species are capable of stressing the endoplasmic reticulum, which increases the amount of the unfolded protein response signals. This leads to inflammation, cell proliferation, and eventually to cell death. Another mechanism in which reactive oxygen species cause cell death would be through the cytoskeleton rearrangement, which affects the contractile proteins. The reactive nitrogen species arise once the reactive oxygen species destroy the mitochondria. This leads to the formation of the reactive nitrogen species, which are responsible for damaging DNA in arsenic poisoning. Mitochondrial damage is known to cause the release of reactive nitrogen species, due to the reaction between superoxides and nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide (NO) is a part of cell regulation, including cellular metabolism, growth, division and death. Nitric oxide (NO) reacts with reactive oxygen species to form peroxynitrite. In cases of chronic arsenic exposure, the nitric oxide levels are depleted, due to the superoxide reactions. The enzyme NO synthase (NOS) uses L-arginine to form nitric oxide, but this enzyme is inhibited by monomethylated arsenic (III) compounds. DNA damage Arsenic is reported to cause DNA modifications such as aneuploidy, micronuclei formation, chromosome abnormality, deletion mutations, sister chromatid exchange and crosslinking of DNA with proteins. It has been demonstrated that arsenic does not directly interact with DNA and it is considered a poor mutagen, but instead, it helps mutagenicity of other carcinogens. For instance, a synergistic increase in the mutagenic activity of arsenic with UV light has been observed in human and other mammalian cells after exposing the UV-treated cells to arsenic. A series of experimental observations suggest that the arsenic genotoxicity is primarily linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its biotransformation. The ROS production is able to generate DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, crosslinks and chromosomal aberrations. The oxidative damage is caused by modification of DNA nucleobases, in particular 8-oxoguanine (8-OHdG) which leads to G:C to T:A mutations. Inorganic arsenic can also cause DNA strand break even at low concentrations. Inhibition of DNA repair Inhibition of DNA repair processes is considered one of main mechanism of inorganic arsenic genotoxicity. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) are the processes implicated in the repair of DNA base damage induced by ROS after arsenic exposure. In particular, the NER mechanism is the major pathway for repairing bulky distortions in DNA double helix, while the BER mechanism is mainly implicated in the repair of single strand breaks induced by ROS, but inorganic arsenic could also repress the BER mechanism. Neurodegenerative mechanisms Arsenic is highly detrimental to the innate and the adaptive immune system of the body. When the amount of unfolded and misfolded proteins in endoplasmic reticulum stress is excessive, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to increase the activity of several receptors that are responsible the restoration of homeostasis. The inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) are two receptors that restrict the rate of translation. On the other hand, the unfolded proteins are corrected by the production of chaperones, which are induced by the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). If the number of erroneous proteins elevates, further mechanism is active which triggers apoptosis. Arsenic has evidentially shown to increase the activity of these protein sensors. Immune dysfunction Arsenic exposure in small children distorts the ratio of T helper cells (CD4) to cytotoxic T cells (CD8), which are responsible for immunodepression.Vega, L. Environmental Health Risks. Nova Science Publishers. pp157-159. In addition, arsenic also increases the number of inflammatory molecules being secreted through macrophages. The excess amount of granulocytes and monocytes lead to a chronic state of inflammation, which might result in cancer development. Arsenic poisoning treatment There are three molecules that serve as chelator agents that bond to arsenic. These three are British Anti-Lewisite (BAL, Dimercaprol), succimer (DMSA) and Unithiol (DMPS). When these agents chelate inorganic arsenic, it is converted into an organic form of arsenic because it is bound to the organic chelating agent. The sulfur atoms of the thiol groups are the site of interaction with arsenic. This is because the thiol groups are nucleophilic while the arsenic atoms are electrophilic. Once bound to the chelating agent the molecules can be excreted, and therefore free inorganic arsenic atoms are removed from the body. Other chelating agents can be used, but may cause more side effects than British Anti-Lewisite (BAL, Dimercaprol), succimer (DMSA) and (DMPS). DMPS and DMSA also have a higher therapeutic index than BAL. These drugs are efficient for acute poisoning of arsenic, which refers to the instantaneous effects caused by arsenic poisoning. For example, headaches, vomiting or sweating are some of the common examples of an instantaneous effect. In comparison, chronic poisonous effects arise later on, and unexpectedly such as organ damage. Usually it is too late to prevent them once they appear. Therefore, action should be taken as soon as acute poisonous effects arise.

The first iron mine in the Lake Superior region, Jackson Mine was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site in 1956 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The Lake Superior Mining Institute said, the mine \\"is attractive in the iron ore region of Michigan and the entire Lake Superior region, because of the fact it was here that the first discovery of iron ore was made, here the first mining was done, and from its ore the first iron was manufactured.\\" Multiple other mines soon followed the Jackson's lead, establishing the foundation of the economy of the entire region. The mine is located northwest of intersection of Business M-28 and Cornish Town Road. Origins of the Jackson Mine (1844‚Äì1847) Surveyor William A. Burt Jackson Mining Co. organizer Philo M. Everett In 1844, government surveyor Douglass Houghton tasked his deputy, William A. Burt, with leading a party into Michigan's Upper Peninsula to carry out a full survey of the land. On September 19, 1844, Burt noted odd compass fluctuations while surveying in the area of Teal Lake (near present-day Negaunee, Michigan). He asked his men to investigate, and they discovered rock outcroppings that proved to contain iron ore, later known as the Marquette Iron Range. Although the local Ojibwe people (Chippewa) and earlier Native Americans certainly knew of these ore deposits, Burt and Houghton noted the find in their reports, and were the first to publish this discovery to the world at large. In June 1845, businessmen organized the Jackson Mining Company in Jackson, Michigan, with Abram V. Berry as president and Philo M. Everett as treasurer. The company was interested in starting a copper mine in the Upper Peninsula; it secured a lease for that purpose and sent a prospecting party, led by Everett, to the Upper Peninsula. Arriving in Sault Ste Marie, they met French Canadian Louis Nolan, who knew of Burt's discovery the year before. While not secret, the find was not generally known. Everett expressed interest in the iron, and Nolan guided the party to the mouth of the Carp River (the location of present-day Marquette) and on to Teal Lake, but was unable to find the correct location. The party continued onward to Copper Harbor, where they fell in with Chippewa chief Marji-Gesick, who was familiar with the Teal Lake area. Marji-Gesick guided the party to the right area and showed Everett iron ore in the roots of a fallen tree. The Jackson Mine was developed here. The stump of this tree was preserved for its historical importance until it burned in 1900, even so the tree was symbolically included in the seal of the city of Negaunee. Everett registered a claim to the site and had samples of the ore assayed; the ore proved to be of high quality, specifically hematite with a small percentage of manganese and chromium. The Jackson Mining Company switched its focus from copper to iron. In 1846, the company sent an expedition to the site to further explore the area and obtain more ore to test. Forging the ore proved a success, and in the winter of 1846‚Äì1847, the Jackson Mining Company gathered equipment at the mine. In 1847, the company organized men and machinery and began taking ore out of the mine. It began constructing the Carp River Forge, which was finished the next year. The first pieces of ore from the mine were forged at the Carp River and sold to construct a steamer. Rise of the Jackson Iron Company (1848‚Äì1870s) In 1848, the Jackson Mining Company was re-incorporated with Fairchild Farrand as president; Berry and Everett and most of the rest of the original investors lost control of the company. In 1849, the company got a new president, Ezra Jones, and a new name: the Jackson Iron Company. In 1850, after numerous problems, the company gave up operation of their forge on the Carp River and leased the forge out. The company was in a precarious financial position, and ceased work for a time on both their forge and mining operations. However, production at the mine soon resumed, although company operations at the forge did not. Jackson began utilising the Marquette forge; however, they did ship some iron ore directly: the first shipment of five tons went to New Castle, Pennsylvania. The purity of this ore shipment attracted attention, and General Joel B. Curtis, president of the Sharon Iron Company of Sharon, Pennsylvania, travelled to Michigan to inspect the mine. Liking what he saw, he purchased a controlling interest in the Jackson Iron Company, and for some years the Jackson location was known as the \\"Sharon.\\" With Curtis's guidance, the company began shipping more ore; in 1852, 70 tons were shipped to Sharon Iron. However, shipping ore was still problematic, and in 1857 the Jackson Mine began building a furnace on their property. The slow increase in mining and then furnace construction brought an influx of workers, and a town grew up around the mine and furnace site. In 1857, the town was incorporated as \\"Negaunee,\\" coming from an Ojibwa phrase meaning \\"I take the lead,\\" or more loosely, \\"pioneer.\\" However, the Jackson Mine was indifferently run, with frequent changes in management, and for some years a \\"record of disappointments and financial embarrassment.\\" In 1861, the management stabilized, and with the greater demand for iron during the Civil War, the Jackson Iron Company declared its first dividend in 1862. The Jackson Mine ramped up its production, peaking in the late 1860s and early 1870s, with 1871 the year of maximum production. The company established an iron furnace at Fayette in 1867, and by 1875 had produced over 1.5 million tons of iron ore.

Decline and closure (1870s‚Äìpresent) After the 1870s, ore prices declined. Even so, by 1900, Jackson Mine had produced over 3.6 million tons of iron ore. However, the Jackson Iron Company was suffering financially, with meager profits due to the declining prices and the irregularity of its deposits. In 1904 the Jackson Mine produced no ore. The mine got a reprieve in 1905, when the Jackson Iron Company was purchased by the Cleveland-Cliffs Company. But, mine yields were still weak, and the Jackson produced no ore in 1908 and 1916. The Jackson Mine closed permanently in 1924, having produced over 4 million tons of ore since its opening in 1856. By the time it closed, the Jackson Mine contained several working pits, as well as trial shafts, a forge, cross-cuts and drifts; some of the underground workings were close to the surface. In the 1950s, the Jackson Mine and portions of the surrounding town of Negaunee were closed due to fears of collapse from undermining. In recognition of the historical significance of the Jackson as the area's first iron mine, the site was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site in 1956 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The mine and area around it were acquired by the city of Negaunee in 2003 and the danger from undermining re-evaluated. In 2006, much of \\"West Old Town Negaunee\\" and areas around the mine itself were re-opened to the public. The city developed a trail system through the area. The overgrown ruins of the early Jackson Mine pit mines can be seen from the trail system.

Originally the Oxford Female College, the building was later used as a sanitarium and was purchased by Miami in 1925. It served as a first-year men's residence hall (though it was briefly a women's hall during World War II), Naval training school, and theatre. The building remained in use as a dormitory until 1958, when the upper floors were condemned and the theatre remained the only part of the building still in use. With the construction of Miami's Center for Performing Arts in 1968, the theatre became unused and the building turned into a storage facility. After a push to save the building in the mid-1970s, the hall was razed because the cost of renovating the building was identical to the costs of with new construction. Miami University's hotel, The Marcum, was built in 1982 on the former site of Fisher Hall. Fisher Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, but delisted that same year.  Construction and planning  Fisher Hall was constructed over a period of four years and completed in 1856. The simple and reserved style of the windows and spacing suggested a Georgian tradition. The three-story building formed the letter T and the head of the T, which is the east‚Äìwest section, was designed to have a major porch with an entry at each end. The center had a projecting section that enclosed a third story ballroom. There was a full basement that contained a kitchen. It was initially built as an independent college building and then Oxford Female College occupied a remote location northeast of the developing town of Oxford, Ohio as well as Miami University. The building's brick shell varied from 12\\" to 16\\", and is a local, pale red and sand molded brick. The floor area of Fisher Hall was variously stated between and 61,384 square feet.  History  Fisher Hall was dedicated on September 3, 1856 as the Oxford Female College. It was founded and constructed under the leadership of Reverend Dr. John Witherspoon Scott, a pioneer educator and father-in-law of President Benjamin Harrison. Ebenezer Lane, a Cincinnati judge, donated 44 acres of land on the northeast edge of Oxford as well as a substantial amount of money. The building was designed by James K. Wilson, who was a charter member of the Cincinnati Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Fisher Hall stayed a part of the women's college until 1882. Eric Johannesen, writer of Ohio College Architecture Before 1870, called the building \\"one of the finest examples of institutional architecture from this period in the Midwest\\". Fisher Hall as Oxford Female College c1860 In 1867, in an attempt to preserve the school, President Robert D. Morris combined it with the Oxford Female Institute, another women's school across town. The building was to serve as a boarding institution. After Morris‚Äô death in 1882, the old college building was sold to George F. Cook, founder of the Oxford Retreat Company, for $45,000 and used as a sanitarium by Dr. Cook until the mid-1920s. Miami purchased the building on August 15, 1925 and remodeled it as a freshman men's residence hall from 1926‚Äì1941. Then it became a Naval training school from 1941‚Äì1944. The radio school trained 5,854 men and women (WAVES). The U.S. Navy established officer-training units across the nation, and this helped to develop Miami's present Navy ROTC program. It later became a women's residence hall from 1944‚Äì1945 and then once again, a men's residence hall until 1958. In 1958 the upper floors were declared unsafe, and were abandoned. The first floor became the Miami University Theatre until the construction of Miami's Center for Performing Arts was completed in 1968. With the construction of a new theatre in CPA, Fisher Hall became a storage repository. Despite efforts to renovate the building, it was destroyed because the calculated cost of restoration was roughly comparable to the cost of new construction.  Naming of Fisher Hall  Fisher Hall 1970s Dr. Alfred H. Upham, president of Miami University at the time, named the building after Judge Elam Fisher, a trustee and alumnus of the university. The name Fisher Hall was appropriate because while the building was occupied by Oxford Female College, Elam Fisher was kicked out while courting a young lady. Disappearance of Ronald Tammen Ronald Tammen, 19, was a sophomore who was enrolled in Miami University School of Business Administration, now known as the Farmer School of Business. Ronald was studying in his room in Fisher Hall between 7 and 9 pm on April 19, 1953. He left his books open and other personal belongings and stepped outside but never returned to his room. His roommate reported his disappearance the next day to campus officials, who notified police the next day. After a few months, the case was placed in the unsolved files. There were three theories on his disappearance. The first was that Ronald Tammen met foul play, the second, that he was a victim of amnesia and finally, that he deliberately planned to leave the campus and start a new life under an assumed name. The third option is what is considered most likely by authorities. An April 1960 article from the Dayton Daily News mentioned that Tammen's roommate Chuck Findlay still believed he was alive and the two of them were \\"very, very close\\". Findlay's mother who occasionally corresponded with Tammen's parents in Maple Heights, a suburb of Cleveland, said his parents have never given up hope and \\"they feel that he‚Äôs somewhere in the world today, and that someday he may come back to them.\\"  The Marcum Center  The Marcum Center, a hotel and conference facility opened in September 1982 on the former site of Fisher Hall. The building is named for Joseph T. Marcum, a Miami alumnus killed in a car accident in 1973. Marcum's father Joseph L. Marcum, also a Miami alumnus, served on the Advisory Council of the School of Business Administration and contributed money toward's the center's construction in his son's memory.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1984 as First Methodist Episcopal Church, which is its original name. History The congregation was organized through a series of Bible Study meetings that were held in Rathburn Cabin in 1845. Early church services were also held in cabins in the early years. The first church building for the congregation was constructed in 1848 on Fifth Street, south of Walnut, and a larger brick structure was built on the same site in 1856. Four years later the congregation lost ownership of the building and had to rent the basement of the building for three years while the main sanctuary was used as a public hall for concerts, lectures, and the like. Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church and First Church merged in 1880, leaving First as the only downtown Methodist congregation. with The congregation dedicated a new church on Ninth Street in 1881. By 1906 the congregation numbered a thousand members even after it had founded 11 other Methodist congregations in the city. The groundbreaking for the present church was begun in 1905, and the cornerstone was laid during a ceremony on July 21, 1906. The church building was dedicated on June 14, 1908. A major restoration of the building was completed in 1940 with a new chancel and altar, rose window, a new pew arrangement, and a renewal of the pipe organ. The education wing was built in 1954. A new Reuter organ was added in 1962-1963 as was the marble backdrop and the Celtic Cross. In 1980 a historical mural was dedicated in the west balcony. The dome and the sanctuary were renovated in 2007. The congregation went through two name changes in its history. In 1939 it became First Methodist after the Methodist Episcopal Church, Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Methodist Protestant Church merged to form the Methodist Church. In 1968 another change to First United Methodist Church occurred when the Methodist Church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church. Architecture The congregation hired the prominent Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot & Bird to design the present church. Because the estimated cost of $175,000 was too high, some of the decorative details of the planned church were not executed. The Neoclassical-style building features a symmetrical plan in monumental proportions, a large pedimented portico supported by Ionic columns, plain exterior surfaces of Bedford stone, and a Roman glass and copper dome that is capped by a Latin cross. The building's proportions are said to match those of the Pantheon in Rome. Pipe organ The church's pipe organ is Reuter Organ Company Opus 1412 installed in 1963. It is located in chambers on the sides of the sanctuary with no visible pipes. The instrument has a traditional style console in a fixed position, and it has a roll top. It features electro- pneumatic chests, three manuals, four divisions, 62 stops, 50 registers, 62 ranks, and 3,435 pipes. The manual compass is 61 notes, while the pedal compass is 32 notes. The drawknobs are in vertical rows on angled jambs. The balanced swell shoes/pedals are standard AGO placement. Rounding out the features are adjustable combination pistons, AGO Standard (concave radiating) pedalboard, reversible full organ/tutti thumb piston, reversible full organ/tutti toe stud, combination action toe studs, coupler reversible thumb pistons, and coupler reversible toe studs.

The junction was triangular, with north, east and west chords, station platforms being sited at the western junction and also, until 1878, at the eastern junction. The Junction took its name from the adjacent tiny hamlet. The junction was created where the Brecon and Merthyr Railway from the south met the Mid-Wales Railway from the north-east. Both railways were to serve Brecon, and to achieve this the latter had running powers over the former from Talyllyn into Brecon. The eastern spur of the triangle permitted through running from South Wales to mid-Wales and also to Hereford. The northern side of the triangle followed the course of the 1816 Hay Railway, a tram-road worked by horses connecting the town of Hay with the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal at Brecon. At the western end lay a tunnel which required widening and deepening for use by standard gauge trains. Talyllyn Junction is often quoted as a defining feature of the Great Western Railway in Wales, namely its inheritance of junctions in unlikely and inconvenient locations. Other examples are Moat Lane Junction, Dovey Junction, Afon Wen and Barmouth Junction (renamed Morfa Mawddach in 1960). All the railways at Talyllyn Junction were closed to passengers in 1962.

Musicians born that year included Carmen McRae and Charles Mingus. Jazz scene In 1922, the jazz age was well underway. Chicago and New York City were becoming the most important centres for jazz, and jazz was becoming very profitable for jazz managers such as Paul Whiteman who by 1922 managed some 28 different jazz ensembles on the east coast, earning over a $1,000,000 in 1922. Despite its popularity, as a form of music Jazz was still not appreciated by many critics, including Anne Faulkner who passed off jazz as \\"a destructive dissonance\\", asking if the music \\"put the sin in syncopation\\"and Henry van Dyke who described jazz as \\"an unmitigated cacophony, a species of music invented by demons for the torture of imbeciles.

Biography  Chvertko was moved to Moldova from the Kyrgyz Soviet Republic. He was a specialist in counterespionage. His job in Chi≈üinƒÉu refers to the Ivan Bodiul epoch of the Rule by Communist Party of the Moldavian Soviet Republic and the change in the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leaders had an evident accent on the stopping of the nationalistic and bourgeois ideology. Some of the achievements of the Nikita Khrushchev epoch of de-Stalinization were underwented. The number of tourists from Romania and other countries (Israel, Europe) has reduced in number, since the change of the coming to the leadership of Communist Party by Leonid Brezhnev. The main goals of activity of Chvertko in Moldova were: * The control of Moldavian- Romanian contacts, and particularly: ** The control under readers of Romanian literature, leasteners of the Romanian radio and TV ** The control of private correspondence ** The supervision of the visits of tourists from Romania ** The intensification of the control under the persons which were made free from GULAG's ** The control under political dissidents * The faith with Zionism * The control under opponents of the Soviet constitutional system (dissidents). The most known cases of dissidents of that epoch are: *Alexandru ≈ûoltoianu (b. 1933, Ineshti village of Teleneshty region), the organizer of the first opposition Party in the Soviet Moldova and one of the first in the USSR, a graduate from the Moscow Institute for International relations. * Gheorghe Ghimpu * Valeriu Graur * Alexandru Usatiuc-BulgƒÉr * Gheorghe Muruziuc A number of processes refer to members of Communist Party, which were investigated by KGB: * Serghei Radautsan - the rector of the Chi≈üinƒÉu Politechinc Institute. * Nicolae Testemi≈£anu - the rector of the Chi≈üinƒÉu State Medical Institute * Boris Alexandru GƒÉinƒÉ - the secretary of the Teleneshty regional committee of Communist Party.

She applied traditional techniques while exploring elements of composition, palette, and minor abstractions of space and paint to create paintings and illustrations which were described by The Seattle Times as \\"calling to mind the Old Masters\\" with a \\"distinctly surrealist sensibility.\\" Life and career Born in Hemet, California, United States, Sundsten's family moved to the Seattle area when she was three. She began painting seriously in her early 20s, and enrolled at the San Francisco Art Institute in 1984. Sundsten's interest was in representational painting, a style which was discouraged in her undergraduate program, and after seeing an Odd Nedrum exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, she traveled to Oslo to study with him. She returned to the Art Institute following her informal internship, where she spent the following two years \\"defending the unpopular direction\\", and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987. In 1990, she received a Master of Fine Arts degree from Stanford University. Sundsten had solo exhibitions at the Grover/Thurston Galleries, Davidson Galleries, Linda Warren Gallery, Diane Nelson Fine Art, Olga Dollar Gallery, and Parker/Zinc Gallery, Hall Spassov Gallery and her work is in the permanent collections of the Tacoma Art Museum, Microsoft, and the University of Washington Medical Center. In a review of Sundsten's 2003 exhibit of drawings and paintings at the Davidson Galleries, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote that \\"Sundsten's fine painting and mastery of realism hides nothing in haze. Her quirky, starkly confrontational imagery doesn't disturb as much as it questions. The characters hang in confused naivete, pondering, 'How did I get here?'\\" Of her 2013 exhibit Creatures at the Grover/Thurston Galleries, art critic Michael Upchurch wrote: \\"Throughout \\"Creatures\\", Sundsten's dazzling painterly facility makes her fantastical subjects feel preposterously plausible.\\" Sundsten taught at Stanford University, the Pratt Institute, and Cornish College of the Arts. Sundsten, who played bass for the art-punk Seattle band The Beakers, was married to King Crimson drummer Bill Rieflin. On August 7, 2019, it was announced that Sundsten had died from complications of lymphoma. Toyah Willcox, in announcing the death of Bill Rieflin, confirmed that the date of her death had been March 9, 2019.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church, which was its previous name. History The congregation was organized as Prospect Park Methodist Episcopal Church when their first church building was constructed on the corner of Washington and Eighth Streets in 1887. It was named after the residential tract it was located in, in what was then the City of North Des Moines. with The area and the church grew slower than expected so they changed their name to North Des Moines Methodist Episcopal Church in the hopes of growing their membership. It changed its name yet again to Trinity. Trinity enlisted the architectural firm of Proudfoot, Bird and Rawson in 1910 to design the present church building. Hinners Organ Company of Pekin, Illinois built the 17-rank tracker pipe organ when the church building was being constructed in 1911. Since 1968 Trinity has hosted, with the support of the Inner City Cooperative Parish, a breakfast program to feed children from the neighborhood, which had been suggested by the local Black Panthers. An evening meal has been served since 1987 in collaboration with Our City Kitchen. In 1992 Trinity became the first ‚ÄúReconciling Congregation‚Äù of a United Methodist Church in Iowa, by which it serves all people regardless of sexual orientation. A prison van ministry brings family members of those incarcerated in Iowa's prisons for visits. The Las Americas Comunidad de Fe, a Hispanic United Methodist Community, worships and studies at Trinity. The two congregations share a weekly bilingual service and a communal meal. Architecture Trinity United Methodist Church is a Neoclassical style building built of brick. The interior features, a stained glass dome above the center of the sanctuary, a balcony that wraps around three sides of the sanctuary, and rose windows on the north and south elevations. Originally, the plaster walls were stenciled. The original pews are still in use. Space for the pastor's office, a kitchen and fellowship hall are located in the basement of the church, and an education wing was also built to the west. A stair hall separates the sanctuary from the education wing. Trinity is somewhat unique when compared with Des Moines' other churches. Along with First Christian Church on University Avenue, it generally covers the entirety of its site. Even the city's downtown churches have small lawns. Pipe organ The church's pipe organ is one of the larger instruments built by the Hinners Organ Company. Located in the front of the sanctuary, hand-pump bellows originally provided the wind for the pipes. An electric motor has subsequently been installed. Overall, the instrument is in an unaltered state from its installation. Because of its high degree of historical integrity, the pipe organ is a contributing object in the church's historic designation. The organ features two manuals, three divisions, 18 stops, 17 registers, and 17 ranks. The manual compass is 61 notes, and the pedal compass is 30 notes. It has slider chests, mechanical action with pneumatic assist, and mechanical stop action. The organ has a traditional style console with an attached keydesk. Rounding out the features are drawknobs in horizontal rows on terraced/stepped jambs, and balanced swell shoes/pedals. The Combination Action is a fixed mechanical system. The organ has a concave radiating pedalboard.

A sequel, CityVille 2, was released in December 2012. It was closed down on February, 2013 just three months after the game's release. CityVille was shut down on April 30, 2015. Players had been given a notice when opening the game prior to the shutdown. Gameplay CityVille allows players to become the owner of a virtual city and to oversee its development into a large metropolis. The city can grow with various tasks to be performed. The amount of energy available increases as the player gains in experience levels, up to a maximum of 30 or 38 with the dam addition and up to 47 with the addition of the wind farm.Zynga support site The energy points are replenished automatically at a constant rate of one energy every five minutes. The player can also visit their neighbor's city and perform up to five different jobs every 12 hours. This gives the player reputation points. The points provide the player with a free goods bonus and one or two heart requests with each reputation level-up. Points increase the amount of energy, experience level and coins bonuses available on a daily basis. Players can send other players gifts and help them in some of their goals. The main task of the game is to complete goals, which can be seen on the top left corner of the screen and earn City Coins. Players can also buy goods, sell goods (supplying goods to other players' cities if their business branches are in their cities), and produce their own goods by farming and shipping. CityVille initially had 80 experience levels, which was increased to 90 experience levels and again to 200 experience levels. In September 2012, Zynga began rolling out CityVille Lakefront, the biggest CityVille expansion to date, to players Level 25 or above. In CityVille Lakefront, players can build a canal and a drawbridge at the same time. CityVille Lakefront gives players more room to build, more buildings, and new challenges. Players build roads and sidewalks to expand their current city out to the drawbridge, which connects the lakefront to the player‚Äôs city. Development  CityVille was announced November 18, 2010, but the launch date was moved to December to allow Zynga to make adjustments to the game. The game had 100,000 players on its launch day, making it Zynga's largest launch ever at the time of its release. On January 2, 2011, CityVille reached the most monthly active users for an application ever on Facebook, beating FarmVilles previous record although numbers may drop as its release date was exactly a month prior. Within its first 50 days, CityVille grew to 61 million monthly active users. CityVille became available as a game on Google+ in late September 2011, as announced on the Google main page the 26th of September 2011. Partnerships Several major music artists promoted their albums using CityVille. Lady Gaga items were available via RewardVille for a limited time. Enrique Iglesias also made his CityVille appearance in October 2011, giving players a task to build Enrique's Euphoria Arena. The arena is an attraction in CityVille, and an avatar of Enrique can be seen performing while the arena is open.Zynga teams up with Enrique Iglesias for CityVille promotion Another event promoted was the Michael Jackson: The Immortal World Tour. Players had the opportunity to place an arena and play a concert.ENTERTAINMENT: Play it before you see it A Michael Bubl√© promotion was released in December 2011 where players could build a bonfire and host a concert.Facebook's No. 1 Game Meets Michael Bubl√© Business franchises have appeared in CityVille, allowing players to build replica shops for fixed periods of time. These brands are Beneful, Best Buy, Bing, Capital One, Coca-Cola, Embassy Suites, Energizer, Falken Tire, McDonald's, Pandora Radio, Progressive Corporation, Toyota and Twix. Editions CityVille 2 In December 2012, Zynga launched the 3D CityVille 2. The game reached 50,000 players before being cancelled on . CityVille Hometown Zynga has also developed a mobile version of the game, CityVille Hometown which is available for the iPhone and iPad; however, the mobile game is not connected to the web game. Like other CityVille games, this game is no longer available. CityVille Monopoly In 2012, Zynga, in conjunction with Hasbro, released a CityVille edition of Monopoly under the \\"Hasbro Gaming\\" imprint. It is essentially a variant of the Monopoly City board game, with its elements retooled to reflect those used in the CityVille online games. The goal is to be the first player to own four skyscrapers by building up your neighborhoods. This is one of several games in the Zynga game library to be released as physical board game versions.

Attaching himself to Wycliffe's group, Ashwardby appears to have been active in preaching, lecturing, and writing, as an opponent specially of the mendicant orders, and he engaged in controversy with the Carmelite, Richard Maydeston, a chaplain of John of Gaunt.

They capture nitrogen from the air and put it in the soil through their roots and falling leaves. They can also bring nutrients from deep in the soil up to the surface for crops with roots that cannot reach that depth. Fertilizer trees are further useful for preventing fertilizer erosion, soil degradation and related desertification, and improving water usage for crops. Sesbania, Gliricidia, Tephrosia, and Faidherbia albida are known as fertilizer trees. Tree lucerne or tagasaste (Cytisus proliferus) is able to fix more than 587 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year. It can increase maize yields from 1 ton per hectare per year to more than 10 tons ha/year in areas with more than 850mm of rain per year or a perched water table. Tree lucerne is also used to create and maintain terra preta. Use in Africa The use of Faidherbia albida in Malawi and Zambia has resulted in a doubling or even tripling of maize yields.http://www.worldagroforestry.org/evergreen_agriculture As part of evergreen agriculture, use of fertilizer trees is proposed as a means to improve food security. Niger has more than 4.8 million hectares of predominantly Faidherbia agroforests, while Zambia has 300,000 hectares.

Hum Jayega's great grandfather Dhaujbeer Gurung migrated along with his family in 1814 AD.Humjayega.com ¬ª About Hum Jayega Early life In 1936, he ran away to Calcutta to become a pilot, but it was not possible due to his poor academic background. With hurdles and economic hardships, he hanged around an engineering college and learned driving with a professor who was fond of his jokes. In 1948, he returned to Darjeeling. With his driving skills, he became cab driver with a post second world war short-chassis Land Rover. He was the first driver ever to take a vehicle to the summit of Tiger Hill, Darjeeling and Tumling. In this new circle of friends he was popular by his nickname Hum Jayega. Whenever the tourists asked who will go on the muddy underdeveloped roads to the hills, he used to answer \\"hum jayega\\" (meaning \\"I'll go\\" in Hindi) and this is how he got his nickname.

Its previous building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History The congregation was established in 1866 as the Black Methodist Episcopal Church. The church was eventually named for Francis Burns, the first black bishop of Methodist Episcopal Church. They first worshiped in a segregated school building for black children. That was the first of six different locations the congregation called home until they bought this building from the German Emmanual Methodist congregation in 1930. with The congregation sponsored a variety of funraising events to raise the money to buy the building, including dinners and a singing quartet of church members who toured the state. A fire damaged the building in the 1940s, and the congregation repaired the damages conforming to the building's original design. They remained here until they moved to their present location on Martin Luther King Jr., Parkway in April 2011. Architecture The German Methodist congregation built the historic building in 1912. It was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Wetherell and Gage. The single-story brick building was built on a raised basement. The sanctuary is on the east side of the building and the pastor's study and classrooms are located on the west side. The two sides sit at right angles to each other with a small, gable-roofed entrance with a parapet set into the angle of the two sections. Most of the windows on the main floor are Tudor arches with brick hoods. The exception is the large Gothic arch window in the sanctuary. There is also half-timberwork on the west elevation.

United States, 366 U.S. 1 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that asking a criminal defendant whether he had testified in previous trials violated his Fifth Amendment rights. Willie Lee Stewart had already been tried twice for murder and had not testified in either trial. During his third trial his defense was insanity and he chose to testify in his own defense. During his cross-examination, the prosecutor asked, \\"This is the first time you have gone on the stand, isn't it, Willie?\\", alluding to the fact that Stewart had not testified in his first two trials. Stewart's attorney objected and ultimately appealed Stewart's criminal conviction to the Supreme Court. The Fifth Amendment provides a criminal defendant with a right to refuse to testify.

Early life Askew was from Lancashire. His family was originally of Mulcaster Crescent, Carlisle, Cumberland, and subsequently of Kirkby Ireleth, in North Lancashire, at which latter place one Thomas Askew, M.A., was instituted vicar in 1606. At the age of seventeen Egeon Askew became a student of the University of Oxford; he was B.A. April 1597, chaplain of Queen's College 1598, and M.A. June 1600. Career About the time of the accession of James I, having the reputation of a noted preacher, he was minister of Greenwich, Kent. He was the author of one book only, which was entered by George Bishop on the registers of Stationers' Hall 27 March 1605, said to be by Egeon Acton Askew, of Queen's College. This work is made up of college sermons. When Dr. Bliss edited Wood, there was no copy in the Bodleian Library; and the copy which Wood saw is wrongly described, being made into two books, after his manner. Brotherly Reconcilement Brotherly Reconcilement was the title of his work. He preached in Oxford for the union of some, and now published with larger meditations for the unity of all in this church and common-wealth. With an apology of the use of the Fathers and secular learning in sermons.' Lond. 4to, 1605. The dedication to King James is dated from Greenwich, 27 April that year. The book shows traces of very wide reading, the margins being filled with references to ancient authorities. Hence Wood described him as 'a person as well read in the fathers, commentators, and schoolmen, as any man of his age in the university.' The second portion of the book is in strict keeping with the style of composition in which he indulged; it is a discussion 'whether Humanitie, i.e. anything beside the words of scripture, be lawful quoad esse or quoad gradum at all, as some deny, or only against adversaries, as some hold, in sermons academical or popular.' It is not known when or where Askew died. Evelyn assured Wood that he did not die at Greenwich.
