Plot summary Twelve-year-old Jamie discovers a strange place in his hometown in which mysterious and demonic entities, known only as Them, are playing a board game with the entire world. Upon his discovering Them, They are forced to make Jamie a Homeward Bounder; this means he must constantly travel from world to world until he finds his home again. Homeward Bounders cannot die, and must not interfere with Play. If he can reach his home he may stay, and re-enter play. No-one is allowed to interfere directly with the Homeward Bounders; for example, if someone were to attempt to hurt or steal from Jamie, that person would die mysteriously. In his travels through the many worlds, Jamie meets the Flying Dutchman, with his ship and crew, and Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew. In addition, he meets a strange entity chained to a rock by Them. Every day, a Vulture comes to peck at him. While he is never named, the entity is Prometheus (he states that his name means \\"foresight\\" and that, according to legend, he was punished for bringing fire to humanity). Jamie becomes skilled at travelling, learning to read the signs left by other Homeward Bounders, growing fluent in many languages and proficient in many unusual skills. So Jamie wanders through the worlds, time passing, never reaching his home, yet hardly aging at all, until he meets Helen Haras-Uquara, from the barbaric world of Uquar. She has a gift - she can change her right arm into anything at all (for instance, an elephant trunk or a snake). Helen has only recently become a Homeward Bounder, because she, like Jamie, has seen Them playing Their game with the worlds. Although she has no experience with anything much, having been shut in a temple for most of her life, she proves to be a resourceful and intelligent person; her knowledge of Them, which mainly comes from the teachings of Uquar, her god, turns out to be very useful. Helen and Jamie travel together until they meet Joris, another new Homeward Bounder, who was a slave and apprentice demon hunter from another world, separated from his master by a demon that showed him Them. The three travel together until they come to a world in which they meet Adam and Vanessa. This world is like our current world, and is also strongly reminiscent of Jamie's home world. He is sure that if they could just travel on one or two worlds more he would reach his Home. The Homeward Bounders convince Adam and Vanessa that They exist, when Konstam, Joris' demon-hunting-master arrives, and joins their party. Konstam is eager to fight this new kind of demon, if only because of the challenge that They present, and the six invade Their strange place and try to defeat Them. The attack goes awry, however, and all six of them are made into Homeward Bounders. This fills the Bounder circuits to their maximum capacity; in effect, this means that They cannot create any more Homeward Bounders. Even They must play by Their own rules. Jamie awakens, alone, and realizes that Adam and Vanessa's world is his Home, only 100 years too late ‚Äì he recognizes a photo of Adam and Vanessa's grandmother when she was young; it was his little sister, grown up. He realizes that although he did not age during his time on the Bounder circuits, time was still passing on his Home world, and his family and his Home world have gone forever. They are cheating; his world is gone. He has no home to go to. His hope of ever returning home crushed, he returns to the mysterious entity chained to a rock, and inadvertently frees him, as only one without hope can free him. With his help, Jamie rallies all the Homeward Bounders, and they make a frontal assault on the main base of Them, and destroy many of Them and also Their special place, known as \\"The Real Place\\". Everyone is returned to their respective home worlds, except for Jamie. Since his home is gone, he chooses to continue to wander through the worlds, so as to keep The Real Place in all the worlds, not just in one place, as They did. So, in the end, Jamie stops Them from returning for at least a few centuries, by giving up any hope of a normal life and having to endure watching his friends die while he stays young.

It is usually instantiated with, or borrowed from, models of computation such as lambda calculus which make heavy use of higher-order functions. For example, in higher-order programming, one can pass functions as arguments to other functions and functions can be the return value of other functions (such as in macros or for interpreting). This style of programming is mostly used in functional programming, but it can also be very useful in object-oriented programming. A slightly different interpretation of higher-order programming in the context of object-oriented programming are higher order messages, which let messages have other messages as arguments, rather than functions.

It is defined as the mass of polymer, in grams, flowing in ten minutes through a capillary of a specific diameter and length by a pressure applied via prescribed alternative gravimetric weights for alternative prescribed temperatures.A. V. Shenoy, D. R. Saini: Melt Flow Index: More Than Just a Quality Control Parameter. Part I., Advances in Polymer Technology, Vol. 6, No. 1, pages 1‚Äì58 (1986); Part II., Advances in Polymer Technology, Vol. 6, No. 2, pages 125‚Äì145 (1986).A. V. Shenoy and D. R. Saini: Thermoplastic Melt Rheology and Processing, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York (1996). Polymer processors usually correlate the value of MFI with the polymer grade that they have to choose for different processes, and most often this value is not accompanied by the units, because it is taken for granted to be g/10min. Similarly, the test conditions of MFI measurement is normally expressed in kilograms rather than any other units. The method is described in the similar standards ASTM D1238ASTM D1238-04 and ISO 1133.ISO 1133:1997. Melt flow rate is an indirect measure of molecular weight, with high melt flow rate corresponding to low molecular weight. At the same time, melt flow rate is a measure of the ability of the material's melt to flow under pressure. Melt flow rate is inversely proportional to viscosity of the melt at the conditions of the test, though it should be borne in mind that the viscosity for any such material depends on the applied force. Ratios between two melt flow rate values for one material at different gravimetric weights are often used as a measure for the broadness of the molecular weight distribution. Melt flow rate is very commonly used for polyolefins, polyethylene being measured at 190 ¬∞C and polypropylene at 230 ¬∞C. The plastics engineer should choose a material with a melt index high enough that the molten polymer can be easily formed into the article intended, but low enough that the mechanical strength of the final article will be sufficient for its use. Measurement Overview of the measurement of melt flow index (MFI) ISO standard 1133-1 governs the procedure for measurement of the melt flow rate. The procedure for determining MFI is as follows: # A small amount of the polymer sample (around 4 to 5 grams) is taken in the specially designed MFI apparatus. A die with an opening of typically around 2 mm diameter is inserted into the apparatus. # The material is packed properly inside the barrel to avoid formation of air pockets. # A piston is introduced which acts as the medium that causes extrusion of the molten polymer. # The sample is preheated for a specified amount of time: 5 min at 190 ¬∞C for polyethylene and 6 min at 230 ¬∞C for polypropylene. # After the preheating a specified weight is introduced onto the piston. Examples of standard weights are 2.16 kg, 5 kg, etc. # The weight exerts a force on the molten polymer and it immediately starts flowing through the die. # A sample of the melt is taken after the desired period of time and is weighed accurately. # MFI is expressed in grams of polymer per 10 minutes of duration of the test. Synonyms of Melt Flow Index are Melt Flow Rate and Melt Index. More commonly used are their abbreviations: MFI, MFR and MI. Confusingly, MFR may also indicate \\"melt flow ratio\\", the ratio between two melt flow rates at different gravimetric weights. More accurately, this should be reported as FRR (flow rate ratio), or simply flow ratio. FRR is commonly used as an indication of the way in which rheological behavior is influenced by the molecular mass distribution of the material. formerly: (MFI = Melt Flow Index) ‚Üí currently: (MFR = Melt mass-Flow Rate) formerly: (MVI = Melt Volume Index) ‚Üí currently: (MVR = Melt Volume-flow Rate) formerly: (MFR = Melt Flow Ratio) ‚Üí currently: (FRR = Flow Rate Ratio) The flow parameter that is readily accessible to most processors is the MFI. MFI is often used to determine how a polymer will process. However MFI takes no account of the shear, shear rate or shear history and as such is not a good measure of the processing window of a polymer. It is a single-point viscosity measurement at a relatively low shear rate and temperature. Earlier, it was often said that MFI give a ‚Äòdot‚Äô when actually what is needed is a ‚Äòplot‚Äô for the polymer processors. However, this is not true now because of a unique approach developed for estimating the rheogram merely from the knowledge of the MFI. The MFI device is not an extruder in the conventional polymer processing sense in that there is no screw to compress, heat and shear the polymer. MFI additionally does not take account of long chain branching nor the differences between shear and elongational rheology. Therefore, two polymers with the same MFI will not behave the same under any given processing conditions.P. Prentice, Rheology and its role in plastics processing: No. 12, p 25, Section 3.1.3, 1995 The relationship between MFI and temperature can be used to obtain the activation energies for polymers. The activation energies developed from MFI values has the advantage of simplicity and easy availability. The concept of obtaining activation energy from MFI can be extended to copolymers as well wherein there exists an anomalous temperature dependence of melt viscosity leading to the existence of two distinct values of activation energies for each copolymer.

It was built between 1724 and 1880 in Baroque style. It is officially called St. Peter and Paul Church, but in colloquial speech it's always referred to as Mindszent church. The church stands on Mindszent Place, which is a triangular place bordered by the church, the International Trade Center and the County Office of National Health Service. The place was named after the mediaeval village of Mindszent (\\"All Saints\\"), which stood here. The church was built where once the village's chapel stood. The chapel and the hospital next to it were first mentioned in 1507. It was renovated in 1562 by the orders of Borb√°la F√°nchy, the owner of the Castle of Di√≥sgy≈ër. In the first half of the 18th century Abbot Mih√°ly Frigyes Althan decided to build a larger church in the chapel's place. It is likely that the church was designed by Giovanni Battista Carlone, who also designed the Minorite Church of Miskolc. The church ‚Äì although construction was still not finished ‚Äì was consecrated in 1748. The construction of the new hospital began in 1761. The parsonage was built in 1778. In the second half of the century ownership disputes arose, both the Archdiocese of Eger and the Diocese of Munk√°cs laid claims to it. Empress Maria Theresa settled the dispute by giving the responsibility of maintaining the church to the Di√≥sgy≈ër estate. Emperor Franz Joseph visited the city in 1857, and seeing the still unfinished church he offered to pay the expenses of constructing one of the towers. The Archbishop of Eger also offered a large sum of money, and several members of the parish donated as well. In 1864 the construction of the two towers began, by the end of the year one of them was complete, the other tower was completed shortly thereafter. Inside of the church there are beautiful Baroque paintings and statues. The painting of the Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul at the high altar was painted by Mih√°ly Kov√°cs in 1855. The other altar paintings also were done by him in 1879. The Baroque statue of Mary with the jar (1739) stands before the church. A small Calvary shrine can be found not far from the church; it was consecrated by the Archbishop of Eger in 1864.

Initially intended to serve in Virginia, the regiment instead was placed under the command of Confederate General Albert Sydney Johnston for service in west of the Mississippi. They soon saw combat, their first skirmish taking place on December 17, 1861, near Woodsonville, Kentucky, when they engaged the Union and were supported by the 6th Arkansas Infantry. The skirmish cost them Colonel Terry, who was killed in action. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lubbock next became colonel, but died of disease before taking command. John A.

Their first major action was at the Battle of Shiloh, where they distinguished themselves. They also supported Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry during the Battle of Murfreesboro. After that, they were sent behind enemy lines to harass the enemy and break their lines of communication. They were engaged in all three of the Battles of Chattanooga, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Knoxville Campaign, and the Atlanta Campaign. The Rangers' ability in harassing the enemy was often called upon against William Tecumseh Sherman. By July 1864, Sherman's army had reached Atlanta. On July 30, Terry's Texas Rangers met the troops of Union Col. E. M. McCook, and defeated them. They then undertook to destroy the railway lines, though with little lasting effect. Following the loss of Atlanta, the regiment harassed the flanks of Sherman's force as it marched through Georgia, although by then the Confederacy lacked the strength to stop him. Their last engagement was at the Battle of Bentonville, where they made their final charge, losing three of their officers: Gustave Cook, the regimental colonel since Harrison had been promoted, Lieutenant Colonel Christian, and Major Jarmon. The regiment surrendered on April 26, 1865, with the rest of the Army of Tennessee.

Qwest Wireless ended the year 2007 with 824,000 wireless subscribers.Small US Operators - Q4 2007 Results  History  Prior to Qwest's acquisition of the RBOC US West, and unrelated to US West Wireless which became Qwest Wireless, US West operated its own analog cellular service, which merged with AirTouch and was eventually combined with GTE and PrimeCo to become Verizon Wireless.Verizon Wireless To Purchase Qwest Wireless Spectrum, Network Assets In 1998, US West Wireless (later Qwest Wireless) was launched as a standalone brand with its own network based in the then-US West 14-state region.http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=4299563 Qwest Wireless maintained its own network elements, device inventory, billing, and service‚Äîoffering combined billing and eventually, discounts for customers who purchased other, qualifying Qwest services. At its largest, Qwest Wireless had roughly one million customers, but due to a lack of network availability outside the 14-state Qwest region, the service suffered from slow growth. This lack of on-network coverage was only partially offset by Qwest Wireless' advanced network features, most notably One Number Service (ONS). ONS allowed customers to receive calls to their home phone number on the wireless. If the calls were not answered, the calls then rang normally on the home phone. Also available was Voice Messaging Link (VML), allowing the wireless and wireline phones to share a single voice mail box. Due to the slow growth and high expense of maintaining a regional wireless network, Qwest Wireless was converted to an MVNO in 2003-2004. Most customers were able to keep their own handsets, requiring only an over-the-air software update to move to the Sprint network. Customers with older handsets were given free replacement devices. The advanced network features such as ONS and VML were still offered with Qwest Wireless after the move to the then-Sprint network (now Sprint Nextel). With an MVNO status, Qwest Wireless was no longer harmed by the lack of a national footprint, but the small size of the brand meant that Qwest Wireless was unable to respond to the increasing importance of handset marketing. Rarely able to offer new, exclusive handsets, Qwest Wireless lacked the buzz that came from these devices, notably the Motorola RAZR and Apple iPhone. In addition, the small subscriber base prevented Qwest Wireless from offering a broad range of handsets, leaving the company with only one or two smartphone offerings as those handsets became increasingly important to wireless carriers due to the higher per-user revenue. On May 5, 2008 Qwest ended their agreement with Sprint Nextel and signed a 5-year contract with Verizon Wireless. Qwest has decided that they will no longer maintain an MVNO and will only resell Verizon Wireless services. The agreement also includes an arrangement to bill Verizon Wireless services on Qwest bills.Qwest to Deliver Verizon Wireless Products and Services to Its CustomersQwest To Deliver Verizon Wireless Products And Services To Its Customers On March 11, 2009, Qwest announced that Qwest Wireless service would be terminated on October 31, 2009.Qwest Wireless discontinues service  Verizon Wireless agent/partnership  On July 28, 2008, Qwest began selling Verizon service to new customers and in August, 2008 began to offer current Qwest Wireless customers the ability to make the transition to Verizon. In October, 2008, Qwest began offering combined billing, adding the Verizon charges to the Qwest bill upon customer request. The transition of current Qwest Wireless customers is going smoothly according to CEO Ed Mueller.Qwest: Verizon Wireless Migration Going Well The Qwest sales arrangement allowed Qwest to function as an agent for Verizon Wireless, selling Verizon-branded services while simultaneously offering the combined billing for customers with both services. Qwest does not maintain inventory of Verizon devices, is not responsible for service provisioning and maintenance, and does not calculate the Verizon bill. The transition of Qwest Wireless customers began in August 2008, initially focusing on customers who did not have other Qwest services (\\"standalone\\" wireless service). Customers who also had other Qwest services were allowed to \\"migrate\\", but were not marketed to directly until October, 2008, when combined Qwest/Verizon Wireless billing was available. In October, 2008, Qwest began offering bundled billing, providing a combined Qwest/Verizon Wireless bill and discounting the Qwest services for qualifying customers who choose to add Verizon to the Qwest bill. Financial terms of this agreement are not being disclosed. Current Qwest Wireless customers will be offered a comparable phone for free by Verizon, or the option to receive 25% off a different phone of the customers choice if they choose to move to Verizon. Activation fees are also waived for migrating customers, as are early termination fees if the customer has a term agreement with Qwest Wireless. With the March 11, 2009 announcement of an end date, Qwest Wireless also discontinued the practice of charging early termination fees for customers who have term agreements with the carrier.Qwest Wireless discontinuing service  External links  * Official Web site * Verizon-Qwest Sales Web site  References  Mobile virtual network operators CenturyLink ","title":"Qwest Wireless"},{"id":"2856037","text":"Sam Kelly (1943-2014) was a British actor from Allo 'Allo! and On The Up.

Known for their independent spirit, iron will and determination, the haenyeo are representative of the semi-matriarchal family structure of Jeju.  History  Jeju's diving tradition dates back to 434 A.D. Originally, diving was an exclusively male profession, with the exception of women who worked alongside their husbands. The first mention of female divers in literature does not come until the 17th century when a monograph of Jeju geography describes them as jamnyeo (literally ‚Äúdiving women\\"). By the 18th century, female divers, at this point commonly referred to as haenyeo, outnumbered male divers. Several possible explanations exist for this shift. For instance, in the 17th century, a significant number of men died at sea due to war or deep-sea fishing accidents, meaning that diving became the work of women. Another explanation is that physiologically, women have more subcutaneous fat and a higher shivering threshold than men, making them more equipped to withstand cold waters. An 18th-century document records that taxes of dried abalone were imposed on ordinary people, forcing many women to dive in cold waters while pregnant. Whatever the reason, as sea diving became a female-dominated industry, many of the haenyeo subsequently replaced their husbands as the primary laborer. This trend was especially prominent after the Japanese colonized Korea in 1910 and diving became much more lucrative. Up until this point, much of what the haenyeo harvested was given to the Joseon government as tribute. When the Japanese took over, however, they abolished this tradition, allowing haenyeo to sell their catch at market and make a profit. Additionally, Japanese and Korean merchants hired haenyeo to work for them in Japan and on the Korean mainland as wage-laborers, increasing their financial situations greatly. On Yeonpyeong-ri, an island near Incheon where many haenyeo worked, their wages, on average, constituted 40 to 48 percent of a typical family's total income. The prominent place of haenyeo in Jeju's economy and in their individual family units continued long after Japanese colonization. In the early 1960s, for example, haenyeo harvests accounted for 60% of Jeju's fisheries revenue and 40% of haenyeo husbands remained unemployed.  In society  Because so many families relied on the haenyeo for the majority of their income, a semi-matriarchal society developed on Jeju with the haenyeo at the head of the household. On the tiny islets off the coast of Jeju, such as Mara Island, where sea-diving was the sole source of income, this reversal of traditional gender roles was fully realized; men would look after the children and go shopping while the women would bring in money for the family. Other manifestations of Jeju's unique society include men paying a dowry to the family of the bride (a reversal of the custom on the Korean mainland) and families celebrating the birth of girls over the birth of boys. While certain elements of a matriarchal society surfaced in Jeju, they were not enough to completely overcome the predominance of Confucianism. As a result, beyond the domestic sphere, little else about Jeju society was different from what existed on the Korean mainland. For example, men filled all political leadership roles and were the only ones who could perform ancestor-worship ceremonies and inherit property and the familial line. Furthermore, during the era of colonial rule, haenyeo remained peasants, never moving up the chain to become small-business owners or managers of seafood manufacturing plants. Even in the home, most haenyeo remained the primary caregiver and handled at least half of the domestic chores. Today, things have changed. The haenyeo are celebrated as one of Jeju's most valued treasures. The Korean government shows its appreciation for the unique contributions of the haenyeo to Jeju's culture by subsidizing their gear and granting them exclusive rights to sell fresh seafood. Furthermore, in March 2014, the government requested the UNESCO to add haenyeo to its Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Inscribed in 2016 (11.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/culture- of-jeju-haenyeo-women-divers-01068  Declining numbers  Like many other vestiges of the past, the sea-diving industry has fallen victim to industrialisation. Beginning in the 1960s, the Korean government sought ways to jumpstart the country's economy in every province. Because Jeju was not a practical place to build factories, the Korean government decided to turn it into an exporter of mandarin oranges. By 1969, a majority of rural workers had joined this new industry. Additionally, about 2% of all land in Jeju was dedicated to farming mandarin oranges. In the 1970s, the government launched another program to bolster Jeju's tourism industry. By 1978, tourism had surpassed agriculture as the island's largest industry. All of this change had a significant impact on haenyeo numbers. Given alternatives to back-breaking labor in miserable conditions, women abandoned the sea-diving industry in droves. In the five years between 1965 and 1970, numbers dropped from 23,081 to 14,143. Even more damning to the haenyeo way of life, education opportunities and attractive positions in emerging industries has deterred younger girls from becoming haenyeo. In 1970, 31% of haenyeo were 30 years old or younger, 55% were between 30 and 49 years old and only 14% were 50 or older. As of 2014, however, 98% of haenyeo were over the age of 50. Developmental process, gear, diving pattern and harvest Traditionally, girls started to train to become haenyeo when they were 11 years old. Beginning in shallow water, trainees worked their way up to more challenging depths. After about seven years of training, a girl was considered a \\"full- fledged\\" haenyeo. Today, the oldest haenyeo are over 80 years old and have been diving for more than 66 years. All together, the tools of a haenyeo consist of a wetsuit, diving mask, fins,Haenyeo, Sea Women of Korea's Jeju Island Part I gloves, chest weights (to assist diving) an L-shaped weeding hoe, and a net attached to a flotation device. The haenyeo stash their catch in these nets until they are done for the day. How long the haenyeo spend in the water depends on the season. Before wetsuits were available and all they wore were cotton swimsuits, haenyeo could stay in the water for only up to an hour at a time during the winter months. After an hour, they got out of the water and sat by the fire for 3‚Äì4 hours to dry off. After this break, they would jump back into the water for another hour. During the summer months, however, they stayed in the water for up to 3 hours at a time before a break. With the introduction of wetsuits, haenyeo found they could stay in the water for five to six hours at a time, even during the winter. With each dive, haenyeo plunge up to 30 meters deep and can hold their breath for over three minutes. Their harvests consist of abalone, conch, octopus, sea urchins, sea squirt, brown alga, top shell, a variety of sargassum, oysters, sea slugs etc. The divers must contend with dangers such as jellyfish, poor weather and sharks.

The cover photograph is of Sisyrinchium macrocarpum taken by Rita Heaton The Plantsman (rebranded from September 2019 as The Plant Review), published quarterly by the Royal Horticultural Society, was a 68-page magazine \\"dedicated to a deeper understanding and appreciation of garden plants\\". Its authoritative articles were written by acknowledged experts on plant-related subjects, including plant profiles, horticulture, botany and the development of garden plants, focusing on ornamental plants grown in temperate gardens. It also reflected the scientific work of the RHS, as well as research conducted by other horticultural and botanical institutions and individuals. The RHS website described The Plantsman as \\"in-depth yet accessible\\" and its target readership as \\"keen gardeners, botanists and horticulturists\\" - in other words, plantsmen and plantswomen.

The quarterly began as a scholarly spin-off from The Garden, the monthly journal of the RHS, which was then widening its editorial scope and popularizing its approach, in response to the wider audience provided by the society's rapidly increasing membership.The Plantsman Volume 1, 1979. Royal Horticultural Society (New Perspectives Publishing Ltd) 1979 Between its inception in 1979 and its full take-over by the RHS in 1994 The Plantsman was published by New Perspectives Publishing Ltd (later Home and Law Publishing Ltd), in association with the RHS. In his introduction to the first edition of The Plantsman, its Editorial Director, Hugh Johnson, noted that the changing editorial policy of The Garden had meant: :\\"‚Ä¶leaving out, or at any rate abbreviating, the sort of scholarly, unhurried, lovingly minute studies of plants which are the true meat of specialist horticultural literature.\\" He described The Plantsman as the solution to this editorial quandary, and continued: :\\"Its intention is to supplement the monthly Journal with quarterly studies for the gardener whose passion for plants will never be satisfied--the plantsman of the title.\\" The first editor of The Plantsman was Elspeth Napier. Among the contributors to the first issue were Christopher Brickell (then Director of the RHS Garden, Wisley, later Director General of the RHS), Roy Elliott (then Editor of the Quarterly Bulletin of the Alpine Garden Society) and Lawrence D Hills, the founder (and the then Director) of the Henry Doubleday Research Association.

WMAG is one of North Carolina's most powerful stations, providing at least secondary coverage as far east as Raleigh, as far north as Martinsville, Virginia and as far south as the Charlotte suburbs. History The precursor to this station signed on in 1946 as WMFR-FM 97.7, a sister station of High Point's 1230 WMFR (We Make Furniture Right) or as some called it, We Make Frank Rich in recognition of the owner (Frank S. Lambeth). WMFR-FM later moved to 99.5. In 1982, WMFR-FM was purchased by Voyager Communications and upgraded their facilities, becoming adult contemporary WMAG \\"Magic 99.5\\".

In later years, \\"Magic 99.5\\" repositioned to soft rock and dropped the \\"Magic\\" handle in favor of just the call sign. Voyager Broadcasting sold WMAG in the early 1990s to what would become AMFM Broadcasting. In 1999, Clear Channel Worldwide acquired the station. Its original transmitter site, still used by 1230 WMFR, is visible atop The Radio Building on Main St. in downtown High Point.

After the local classic hits station WTHZ \\"Majic 94.1\\" switched to a contemporary Christian format, WMAG added more 1970s' and 1980s' music in effort to gain some of the former WTHZ listeners. Another local radio personality, Rod Davis, lost his job as the co-host on WMAG's morning show, on Wednesday October 26, 2011; when Clear Channel Communications announced that it had dismissed some on-air and off-air staff, within that same week, throughout the United States. The reason for the layoffs is to benefit in a reshaping of its regional and local programming that should enable it to seek out advertisers focused on areas wider than a single market.

It is located on a steep hillside on the eastern side of the Maiella mountains. Its proximity to the ski slopes of Passo Lanciano, guarantees the availability of winter sports, while the town is also only 20 minutes by car from the Adriatic Sea. History The area in which Pretoro is located has been occupied since prehistoric times; remains from that period have been found here, as well as inscriptions in Latin from the Roman era. The first documented mention of the town is in a 12th-century record. Pretoro's name may derive from the word \\"preta\\", an earlier form of the word \\"pietra\\" or stone. The town stands on a rocky landscape that does not lend itself to farming. Because the town is surrounded by beech-forest, the people of Pretoro have specialized over the centuries in woodcarving. Main sights Pretoro is composed of a cluster of stone buildings which climb the steep mountainside; the oldest part of the town is at the highest point, while down below is a newer section. The 13th century Sanctuary of the Madonna della Mazza is located a little above the town. This was a hermitage built by Benedictine and Cistercian monks from Santa Maria Arabona at Manoppello.

There he both adapted and originated several notable techniques: in the abstract film Perspectrum he adapted the Norman McLaren technique of multiple passes and variable exposures; the films Afterlife and Top Priority were the result of accidentally discovering, and then developing, the under-lit plasticine technique; for the film Paradise he developed the under-lit pin hole technique with multiple passes; and for The Bead Game he created the procedures for moving thousands of tiny beads under an ever- zooming-outward camera. He co-produced animation projects with NHK of Japan and Channel Four of Britain, and contributed French language segments to Sesame Street for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. His many international awards include the British Academy Award, two Oscar nominations, the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival, Grand Prix at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival, and Grand Prix at the Montreal World Film Festival. He is particularly known for his 1977 film Bead Game which was nominated for an Academy Award. Teaching and Master Classes Through the National Film Board of Canada Outreach Program Ishu Patel conducted animation workshops with Inuit artists of Cape Dorset, with healthcare fieldworkers in Ghana, and with students in the former Yugoslavia, Korea, Japan and the United States. During those years he returned regularly to Ahmedabad, India where he often taught his approaches and techniques to the animation students at his alma mater the National Institute of Design, and contributed some assistance in formulating the animation program. After leaving the NFBC he conducted student workshops and Master Classes throughout Asia, mentoring young faculty and developing curricula. He has conducted Master Classes at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Jerusalem, and the Animation Image Society of Toronto, at the School of Animation, Communication University of China, Beijing, and at the School of Animation, Southwest University of Nationalities, Chengdu, China. Ishu Patel was Special Guest and conducted screenings and a Master Class at the 7th. Big Cartoon Festival in Moscow, Russia, November 2014. He was Visiting Professor at the School of Art, Design and Media, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Church The Point was situated in the old merchant's quarter of Mount Stuart Square. The focal point of the square was St Stephen's church, that would later be turned into The Point. The church was designed by architect E. M. Bruce Vaughan and constructed between 1900-2 to replace a temporary iron frame church and opened as the chapel of St. Mary's. In 1912, it became a separate parish under the name of St. Stephen. The church was designed in a Gothic style, the interior dominated by a single nave with six bays of pointed arches and an arch-braced roof. The exterior includes a bell tower at the northeast corner with an octagonal spire. In May 1975 it became a Grade II listed building, presently listed as \\"The Point (Formerly St Stephen's Church)\\". The parish was deconsecrated in 1992. Entertainment venue The church was used as a community centre and theatre until 2001, when it was purchased by its current owners. Renovations in 2003 transformed the church to a venue for live music performance and regular club-nights, including Bogiez. The entire building was restored and much of the original architecture was kept, including all the stained glass windows. The Point is now equipped with a fully functional and permanent stage, lighting system, in-house PA, and projection system. In early 2009 The Point announced its closure, citing reasons such as continued noise complaints from neighbours, which had led to a costly refurbishing and soundproofing bill. Singer Cerys Matthews weighed in her support for the venue, saying her 2006 gig there was \\"one of the most memorable gigs I‚Äôve ever played. The acoustics are brilliant and it‚Äôs a very intimate experience with the audience... Singers come to Wales to play places like The Point so we can‚Äôt really afford to lose them.\\" See also *List of cultural venues in Cardiff Notes External links *What's on at The Point * Bogiez Rock Club Point Point Butetown Former music venues in Cardiff Former churches in Cardiff ","title":"The Point, Cardiff"},{"id":"2856102","text":"Roderick Percy Sparks (March 7, 1880 ‚Äì March 29, 1959) was a Canadian manufacturer and environmentalist. He is widely credited with being the Father of Gatineau Park. Born on March 7, 1880 in Ottawa, Canada, Sparks was the great grandnephew of Ottawa pioneer Nicholas Sparks. Educated at the Ottawa Public School, and the Ottawa Collegiate Institute, he was a garment manufacturer as well as president and executive committee member of various commercial associations, including the Canadian Manufacturers Association. He married Rheba Fraser on February 11, 1911, and they had three children. He served as the president/commodore of the Britannia Boating Club from 1910-13.Ottawa Citizen Jul 20, 1910  Gatineau Hills  The Ottawa Journal of March 30, 1959 credited Percy Sparks with being the \\"father of the Gatineau Park,\\" adding that, as chairman of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League from 1937 to 1947, he \\"brought about the first purchase by the Dominion government of what is now [‚Ä¶] Gatineau Park.\\" On May 12, 1955, the same paper said that \\"Mr. Sparks and his associates are generally credited with 'selling' the late Prime Minister Mackenzie King the idea of setting aside a national recreation area on the outskirts of Canada's capital.\\"Ottawa Journal, March 30, 1959; Ottawa Journal, May 12, 1955. A noted conservationist, tariff expert and successful businessman, he waged battles against government corruption in the 1920s, playing a key role in the 1926 Customs Investigation, and defended workers' rights in the 1930s, helping Conservative MP Harry Stevens establish the Select Committee on Price Spreads.Wilbur, Harry, H.H. Stevens, 1878‚Äì1973, University of Toronto Press, 1977, 244 p. He also dedicated nearly a quarter century of his life to building a park in the Gatineau Hills. As chairman of the research committee of the Federal Woodlands Preservation League, Sparks had urged the Bennett government to commission a survey of the Gatineau forests in a letter of April 3, 1935 to Interior Minister T. G. Murphy. The importance of the resulting study was acknowledged in the 1952 annual report of the Federal District Commission: > The government, having been concerned about the cutting of the forest cover > in the Kingsmere area, authorized an extensive survey of this matter and the > findings were published in the Lower Gatineau Woodlands Survey. [In 1938], > as a result of the above-mentioned report, the Commission commenced the > development of Gatineau Park by the acquisition of land. While chairman of the League, Sparks also wrote several documents that were crucial to the creation and initial development of Gatineau Park.Murray, Jean- Paul, \\"Roderick Percy Sparks: Founder of the Gatineau Park,\\" brief submitted to the Board of Directors of the National Capital Commission by the New Woodlands Preservation League, April 4, 2003: www.gatineauparc.ca/documents_en.html. They include a December 13, 1937 memorandum to the office of Prime Minister King outlining a proposal for creating the park; a preliminary master plan proposal for Gatineau Park sent to the Federal District Commission on October 9, 1945; and a 1946 memorandum to the Standing Senate Committee on Tourist Traffic. Sparks also played a central role in helping orient the park's design and development in his capacity as chairman of the Advisory Committee on Gatineau Park from 1947 to 1954. He did so by, among other things, writing the 1949 Report of the Advisory Committee on Gatineau ParkReport of the Advisory Committee on Gatineau Park, May 16, 1949: www.gatineauparc.ca/documents_en.html. and ‚Äì perhaps most importantly ‚Äì the 1952 Report on a Master Plan for Development of Gatineau ParkReport on the Master Plan for the Development of Gatineau Park, Advisory Committee on Gatineau Park, May 1952: www.gatineauparc.ca/documents_en.html. (the latter being, in effect, the first comprehensive master plan for the park, though the NCC has failed to acknowledge this). Sparks was also a member of the Advisory Committee's Parkway subcommittee which had been created to study the possibility of building a parkway through Gatineau Park. In July 1953, the subcommittee went on a fact-finding mission to Virginia's Shenandoah National Park and Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountain National Park.Report of the Parkway Subcommittee for Gatineau Park, Gatineau Park Advisory Committee, 1953: www.gatineauparc.ca/documents_en.html. The recommendations made in its report were largely inspired by Shenandoah's Skyline Drive, and many of them were later implemented in Gatineau Park. The park's √âtienne Brul√© Lookout is a mirror image of lookouts found throughout Shenandoah. In his last major contribution to the park, a 1956 memorandum to a joint parliamentary committee, Sparks argued that the public interest had been seriously ignored in the planning and management of Gatineau Park.Memorandum to the Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Commons on the Federal District Commission, R.P. Sparks, 1956: www.gatineauparc.ca/documents_en.html. He underlined that the personal, financial and political interests of area landowners exercised undue influence over park development: > All of the property owners in [the Meech Lake and Kingsmere] area have a > direct financial interest in the plans of the Commission [...]. In fact it > is no reflection on them to say that their interest may be in direct > conflict with the public interest.Memorandum to the Joint Committee of the > Senate and House of Commons on the Federal District Commission, R.P. Sparks, > 1956: www.gatineauparc.ca/documents_en.html. Perhaps his most eloquent vision statement for the park is to be found in the 1949 Report of the Advisory Committee on Gatineau Park: > The prime objective of this plan should be to retain throughout the main > area of the park the atmosphere of the Canadian woods and preserve for all > time the natural beauty of the lakes and wooded hills as an inspiration to > all ‚Ä¶ While this park will serve a useful purpose as a place of recreation, > bringing physical benefits, its greater purpose lies in its possibilities as > a moral and spiritual force in the lives of those who visit it.Report of the > Advisory Committee on Gatineau Park, May 16, 1949: > www.gatineauparc.ca/documents_en.html. Roderick Percy Sparks died of pneumonia in Ottawa on March 29, 1959, following a holiday in Tucson, Arizona. Continuing influence Sparks' influence continues to be evident throughout Gatineau Park, most notably in policies advocated in successive NCC master plans. The extent of that influence was acknowledged in 1950 by French urban planner Jacques Gr√©ber in his landmark report on Canada's capital: > The Advisory Committee to the Federal District Commission on Gatineau Park, > of which Mr. P. Sparks is Chairman [‚Ä¶] are in full and enthusiastic accord > with us on the possibilities of this wooded reserve, and have, in large > measure, inspired our recommendations relative to practical developments of > this providential asset of the Capital Region.Gr√©ber, Jacques, Plan for the > National Capital, National Capital Planning Service, King's Printer, Ottawa, > 1950, p. 263. Official recognition As well, the NCC recognized Sparks' key contribution to the park, albeit belatedly, when it dedicated the Roderick Percy Sparks Exhibition Hall at an official ceremony in the park's visitors centre on July 8, 2005. Speaking on that occasion, Sparks' grandson, Sandy Crawley, recalled memories of his grandfather: Words from his eldest granddaughter, Ms. Michal Anne Crawley, were also spoken during the dedication ceremony: > Pop gave us an appreciation for nature and a heritage which, even if we live > in cities, can never be taken away. It is in our blood. And in our family's > particular blood are the Gatineau Hills, thanks to him. We hope Gatineau > Park will continue to give that heritage to all who visit. It is a special > place, one to be cherished and taken care of.

The village is located on the small Vedvik peninsula, itself part of the greater Nordkinn Peninsula, at the southern end of the Mehamnfjorden, a bay off of the Barents Sea. The village of Gamvik lies about to the east and the village of Kj√∏llefjord (in Lebesby Municipality) lies about to the southwest. Mehamn Chapel is located in this village. The village has a population (2017) of 779 which gives the village a population density of .

Norwegian County Road 888 connects Mehamn to the European route E6 highway at the base of the Nordkinn Peninsula, and from there on to the towns of Kirkenes in the east and Alta in the west. Mehamn is a port of call for the Hurtigruten coastal ship. Mehamn is also connected by air via Mehamn Airport, with services by Wider√∏e to the nearby city of Troms√∏. History =Whaling= Svend Foyn established the whaling station in Mehamn that was built in 1884-1885. It was put into use starting in the spring of 1885, and it became the largest of its kind in Finnmark county. After Foyn‚Äôs death in 1894, the whaling station was run by Foyn‚Äôs whaling company. Svend Foyn also established the Svend Foyn Chapel, in Mehamn starting in 1887.200 years since the birth of Svend Foyn (Kystmuseene) =Mehamn Rebellion= The background for the Mehamn rebellion was a period of miserable cod and capelin fishing. The fishermen blamed the local whaling. They believed that the whales chased the fish towards the shore. With few whales left, the fish stayed out of reach. Frustrations were growing by the day during spring of 1903. By Whitsunday, about 2000 angry fishermen were in harbour in Mehamn. At the time, the village had 123 permanent residents. When the new manager of the whaling station denied help to a fishing boat that came from sea with a broken helm, the fishermen had had enough. On the 2nd of June 1903, a large number of them gathered outside the factory. During the following two days, machinery was destroyed, chimneys were torn down, and the large steam boilers were sunk. The guard and the single police officer could do nothing but watch. Military forces from Vard√∏ and Harstad were mobilized, but did not reach Mehamn before the factory was completely destroyed and the situation was calm again. Some of the vandals were caught and convicted. They received very light sentences in jail and then the following autumn, general elections were held, and the Labour Party, which had fought for the protection of the whales, entered parliament for the first time with four MPs. They all represented the three northernmost counties of Norway. They were said to have ‚Äúridden to Parliament on a whale‚Äôs back.‚Äù In December, a law was passed ensuring the preservation of the whales in Norwegian waters off the coast of Nordland, Troms and Finnmark. =1982 air crash= On 11 March 1982, a Wider√∏e Twin Otter crashed into the sea on approach to Mehamn Airport during flight from Berlev√•g Airport, killing all on board.

It later became a music venue, with offices remaining in use in the West Wing, before being closed indefinitely in 2013 due to building safety issues. Following a series of proposals to demolish the building, Cardiff Council purchased the Coal Exchange. In 2016 the property was sold to the Liverpool-based hospitality company Signature Living, which began a programme of restoration and conversion of the building into a hotel. The first phase of this renovation was completed with the opening of the first thirty rooms in April 2017, with further rooms added as renovations continued. As of March 2019, renovations were still ongoing to the rear areas of the building, over 90 rooms had been completed, and the hotel restaurant had opened. History =Construction and early history= Coal ships tied up at Cardiff Docks in the 1910s Before the Coal Exchange was built in Mount Stuart Square, the area was a residential square with a central garden. It was taken over by commerce as the city grew in prosperity. Built to provide a dedicated location for merchants and traders to sell coal, it followed construction of buildings of a similar function in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The Cardiff Coal Exchange: Conservation Management Plan, Edwards, Zoe, Cotswold Archaeology July 2017 Prior to its construction, coal merchants used to chalk up the changing prices of coal on slates outside their offices or struck deals in the local public houses. It was built and opened in stages, the central trading hall and east block completed first. The trading hall was a large central space around which suites of offices were located. The London and Provincial Banking Company occupied the majority of the north side. As Cardiff became the biggest coal port in the world, the building was constructed between 1884 and 1888 by Edwin Seward as a base from which to conduct trade negotiations regarding the coal mines of the South Wales Valleys ‚Äì most of which was shipped to Cardiff for distribution. The building played an important role in the industrial Cardiff of the 19th century. Paired Corinthian columns, an oak balcony, and rich wood panelling adorn the trading hall, which was reconstructed by Edwin Seward in 1911. Following its opening, coal owners, ship owners and their agents met daily on the floor of the trading hall where agreements were made by word of mouth and telephone. During the peak trading hour of midday to one o'clock, the floor might have as many as 200 men gesticulating and shouting. It was estimated that up to 10,000 people would pass in and out of the building each day. At one time the price of the world's coal was determined here. It was at the Coal Exchange that the first ever ¬£1,000,000 deal was agreed\\"Derelict railway building on top 10 at-risk buildings\\", BBC News, 14 September 2016. in 1904.\\"Talks to secure future of Coal Exchange in Cardiff Bay\\", BBC News, 20 January 2014. Retrieved 27 October 2016. The building interior was lavishly refurbished in 1912 by Edwin Seward, and reopened as the ‚ÄòNew Exchange Building‚Äô. In 1915, an extension was added to the southern section, connected to the trading hall. =Post-war period= The southern entrance, with now demolished extension, 1920s Cardiff's reliance on coal made the Bute Docks highly vulnerable to any downturn in the demand for it. With the end of the war the docks went into further decline. The Coal exchange closed in 1958 and coal exports came to an end in 1964. The southern extension was demolished in the 1970s. The building became Grade II* listed in 1975.Cardiff Exchange Building, Butetown, British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 21 March 2013. In 1979 the Coal Exchange was earmarked as a future home of the proposed Welsh Assembly and a heavily reinforced underground carpark was constructed (also envisaged to act as a nuclear shelter) but the plan for devolution was rejected by the Welsh people in a referendum. In 1983 the building was considered as a headquarters for the Welsh language television station, S4C, though this also failed to take off. The Exchange Hall was used with great regularity during this period as a filming location for various parts of the entertainment industry, for example the BBC drama Bevan. =Re-opening and closure= A 'Save the Cardiff Coal Exchange' petition being presented at the Welsh Assembly in 2014 In 1988 the building was re-acquired and subsequently completely refurbished in 2001 to turn it into a major venue. The venue hosted acts such as the Arctic Monkeys, Manic Street Preachers, Ocean Colour Scene, Stereophonics, Van Morrison and Biffy Clyro. The Coal Exchange closed on 7 August 2013 as a result of building safety issues. With the subsequent liquidation of the company which owned it in 2014, ownership of the Coal Exchange passed to the Crown Estate. It then became the subject of efforts to preserve the historic fabric of the building by the not-for-profit organisation Save the Coal Exchange Limited. In February 2015, Welsh Government Economy Minister Edwina Hart commissioned a feasibility study into future re-use of the building. In May 2015 it was confirmed that the exchange would be used for filming of the remake of The Crow. In 2016, filmmaker Nick Broomfield visited the building as part of his documentary Going Going Gone, which investigated the deterioration and heritage of the Coal Exchange.Nick Broomfield: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve always been fascinated by buildings and history‚Äô The Guardian, article 1 May 2016 = The Exchange Hotel = In 2016 it was announced that the building was to be fully refurbished as a hotel by private company Signature Living, with a museum detailing the history of the building and of the Cardiff Docks.

The exterior is made of pale Corsham stone on three sides, with yellow brick on the western elevation. The roof is slate, topped with multiple chimneys mainly in yellow brick. Its style was derived from French Renaissance models. The main entrance front faces south. The building is made up of three storeys and basement, plus attic storeys in the central pedimented 'frontispiece', with a hipped pavilion roof. The entrance is guarded by a pair of fluted Corinthian columns, and topped by a floral relief in a triangular pediment surmounted by Royal Arms. On the north east corner, steps lead up to a projecting porch which housed Barclays Bank, resident here since building opened. The interior retains an entrance hall with a Jacobethan style moulded plaster ceiling, panelled walls, and woodblock and inlay floor. At the rear are two lions on high plinths supporting clock faces showing times of Cardiff high tides. The central Coal and Shipping Hall dominates the building, surrounded by galleried tiers, in Jacobethan style dark wood.

It is part of the World Heritage Site Mud√©jar Architecture of Aragon. The cathedral is located on the Plaza de la Seo and is commonly known as La Seo (Aragonese for \\"see\\") to distinguish it from the nearby El Pilar, whose name (pillar) is a reference to an apparition of Mary in Zaragoza (also known as Saragossa). They both share co-cathedral status in metropolitan Zaragoza. History =Origin= The location of the Seo has its roots in the old Roman forum. Unlike other Roman city forums, the forum of Caesaraugusta was not located at the confluence of the Cardus and the Decumanus, but instead near the Ebro river, adjoining the river port. The forum, besides being the civic and commercial center of the city, contained the main temple. The Museum of the Forum is found below the plaza del Pilar, across from the facade of the cathedral. There have been no remains found of either a Visigoth or a Mozarabic church. Romanesque apse with mud√©jar and gothic additions Frontal view of both apses =The Mosque= Hanas ben Abdallah as San'ani (? - 718), a disciple of someone close to Mohammed, built the main mosque of Saraqusta al Baida, Zaragoza la Blanca, according to Al- ·∏§umaydƒ´ (1029‚Äì1095). The main mosque is certainly one of the oldest of Al- Andalus. The edifice underwent two additions, one in the 9th century and one in the 11th century, under the Taifa king of Zaragoza, Mundir I. During the restoration completed in 1999, a number of remains were discovered, such as the impression of the minaret on the external walls, and the floor of the ancient structure. In addition, the entrance was located in the same place as that of the current cathedral. The arrival in Zaragoza in 1118 of Alfonso I, the Battler did not lead to the immediate demolition of the mosque. He gave the Muslims one year to move out of the town, and on October 4, 1121, the building was consecrated under the name San Salvador, and the necessary renovations were made to allow the building to be used for Christian purposes. =The Romanesque Cathedral= The destruction of the mosque and the construction of the Late Romanesque cathedral began in 1140. The new church, with a basilical layout consisting of a transept and three naves ending in apses, constructed of stone, owed much stylistically to the Cathedral of Jaca, from which it took various elements. Besides the church building itself, it had an archive, a refectory, a nursery, and two cloisters. From this era the lower part of two of the apses is still preserved, with small windows between inscribed capitals depicted, adorned with so-called \\"checkered jaqu√©s\\" on the outside, and, inside, a set of sculptures that at present are hidden behind the main altarpiece. The construction of the original cathedral continued throughout the 13th century. From 1204 up until the 15th century, all Aragonese kings were crowned in this church, by a special privilege bestowed by Pope Innocent III. The king, who the previous night had kept watch over his armaments in the Aljafer√≠a, would approach from there in a procession. The ceremony included four parts: investiture of weapons, unction with holy oil, placing of the crown and the royal insignia, and oath of the fueros (statutes) and liberties of the Kingdom of Aragon. The last king to be crowned in La Seo was Charles I in 1518. Later kings needed only to swear to the fueros. Royal baptisms, weddings, and burials were also performed in the cathedral. =The Gothic-Mud√©jar Cathedral= La Seo, night. In 1318 Pope John XXII created the archbishopric of Zaragoza, making it independent of the see of Tarragona, and with that the building became a metropolitan cathedral. From this point the additions were carried out using cheap materials that were found nearby in abundance: bricks and plaster. Under the supervision of the archbishop Pedro L√≥pez de Luna (1317‚Äì1345) a Gothic church with three naves (the present three central naves) was built, keeping the Romanesque apses. The central nave was built higher than those on the sides, making it possible to create windows that from 1447 would be covered with stained glass. In 1346 a Mud√©jar dome was started to provide light at the altar, with the participation of the masters Juan de Barbastro and Domingo Serrano. The work was finished in 1376, when Don Lope Fern√°ndez de Luna was already archbishop, creating a spacious, well-lit Gothic cathedral. In 1360, during the archbishopric of Don Lope Fern√°ndez de Luna, the main facade was renovated and the so-called Parroquieta was built, all in the Mud√©jar style. The only thing that has been preserved is the Parroquieta or parochial chapel of San Miguel Archangel, that was built as a closed and independent chapel inside the building, and that archbishop Don Lope designed as a funeral chapel. The construction, elegantly carried out in Gothic-Mud√©jar style, is a unique example of the work of the Aragonese masters and the Seville builders, who covered the exterior wall with geometric drawings made of smooth brick and glazed ceramic. In the interior, the roof is constructed of gilded wood, also in the Mud√©jar style. Right transept, with the 16th-century chapel of Gabriel Zaporta =Renaissance= In 1403 the old dome fell down. The Antipope Benedict XIII (Papa Luna), Aragonese by birth, initiated a reconstruction of the building. The Romanesque apses were elevated, two towers buttressing the sides of the apses were added, and a new dome was built in the shape of a Papal Tiara. Decorated in 1409 by the master Mohammed Rami, it may have been viewed by Benedict XIII on his visit to the city in 1410. The main altarpiece was constructed during the archbishopric of Don Dalmau de Mur y Cervell√≥ (1431‚Äì1456). Dalmau Mur concentrated on beautifying the interior of the building, taking charge of, besides the main altarpiece, the chorus and other smaller constructions. On September 14, 1485, Pedro de Arbu√©s, the canon and head Inquisitor of Arag√≥n, was assassinated in the cathedral as he was praying while wearing a helmet and chain mail. This was the consequence of the bad reception that the Inquisition had in Arag√≥n, where it was seen as an attack by the crown on the fueros, the local laws and privileges. In particular, some of the most powerful families among the converted Jews - such as the S√°nchez, Montesa, Paternoy, and Sant√°ngel families - were implicated in the assassination. As a consequence, there arose a popular movement against the Jews; \\"nine were finally executed in persona, in addition to two suicides, thirteen burnings at the stake, and four punished for complicity\\" according to the account of Jer√≥nimo Zurita. Pedro de Arbu√©s was sainted by Pope Pius IX in 1867; his sepulchre, designed by Gil Morlanes the elder, is found within the cathedral in the chapel of San Pedro Arbu√©s. During the 16th and 17th century, the cathedral was one of the centers of the Aragonese school of polyphonic music. Musicians Melchor Robledo, Sebasti√°n Aguilera de Heredia, Pedro Ruimonte, Diego Pontac, Jus√©pe Xim√©nez and Andr√©s de Sola, among others, worked and composed there. =Recent centuries= View of Zaragoza in 1647, painted by Juan Bautista Mart√≠nez del Mazo, though it is sometimes attributed to his master Diego Vel√°zquez. The dome of the cathedral can be seen in the center, to the left of the bridge and the market. The long- standing rivalry between the canons of El Pilar and of La Seo was well known in the 17th century. The cathedral chapter of El Pilar even brought a suit to win the episcopal seat, a suit that was decided by Philip IV in favor of La Seo. The disputes would not be resolved until, in 1676, Pope Clement X made the Solomon-like decision to merge the two chapters via the Bull of Union. Six prebendaries and 15 canons would reside in La Seo, and the same in El Pilar, and the dean would live six months in each one. Also during the 17th century, the old and decrepit Mud√©jar tower was pulled down, and in 1686 construction was begun on a new one. The new tower, which was designed in Rome in 1683 by Juan Bautista Contini in the Baroque style, was started in 1686 and finished in 1704 with the placement of the spire. The front was constructed in the 18th century in an Italian-Baroque style that was clearly of a neoclassic aspect. It was entrusted by the Archbishop A√±oa to Julian Yarza, a disciple of Ventura Rodr√≠guez. During the second half of the 20th century, a thorough restoration of the building took place, which lasted some 23 years. The project can be divided into four stages: * From 1975 to 1987: replacement of the six pillars of the main nave, roofs, eaves, glassworks, foundation, destruction of adjacent buildings, and archeological excavation. * From 1987 to 1992: wall of the Parroquieta, dome, chapels of the head and neoclassical facade. * From 1992 to 1994: completion of outside work and excavation of Roman and Muslim remnants. * From 1995 to 1998: restoration of the tower, the spire and the clock, the organ, the main altarpiece; in general all the plasterwork and chapels were cleaned and restored; also the tapestry museum was renovated. In total more than two billion pesetas were spent by the Government of Aragon, the Archbishopric of Zaragoza and the Metropolitan Chapter, the Department of Education and Culture of Spain, Ibercaja, and Caja de Ahorros de la Inmaculada. As of 2005, the sacristy was still in the process of being restored. Architectural styles Facade, dome and bell tower La Seo was built on the site of the ancient Roman forum of Augustus and of the main mosque of the Moorish city of Saraqusta, elements of whose minaret form part of the current tower. The construction began in the 12th century in the Romanesque style, and underwent many alterations and expansions until 1704, when the Baroque spire completed the tower. The cathedral is a mixture of styles, from the Romanesque apse (12th century) to the Baroque tower and Neo- Classical main door (18th century), passing through Mud√©jar and Gothic. Of the diverse styles that make up La Seo Cathedral, the most important elements are: * Romanesque: in the exterior and the lower part of the apse. The Roman interior of the apse still remains, but is now covered by the Gothic altarpiece. In the sacristy are the \\"olifante\\" by Gaston IV of B√©arn, built in ivory in the 11th century, and the relic-busts of Valerius of Saragossa (patron saint of Zaragoza), Saint Vincent of Saragossa, and St. Lawrence donated by the antipope Benedict XIII. * Gothic: mixed with Mud√©jar, especially in the upper part of the exterior of the apse. The three central naves with their arches and tracery. Magnificent altarpiece largely of painted alabaster made by Pere Johan and Hans de Suabia. Choir stalls. Museum of Flemish tapestries from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, one of the three largest such collections in the world. * Mud√©jar: exterior wall of the Parish of San Miguel and its interior roof, gilded with wood. The Aragonese Mud√©jar has been named a World Heritage Site. * Renaissance: In the Parroquieta of San Miguel, the tomb of the archbishop Don L√≥pez Fern√°ndez de Luna from the 16th century. Dome with Mud√©jar influences, built in the first third of the 16th century to replace the older Moorish dome. * Baroque: Tower and gate. The cathedral's museum has been restored recently and is open to the public. It is a tapestry museum that displays one of the finest collections of tapestries in the world. Interior Beginning with the foot of the cathedral, the chapels on the right side: *Door of the Pabostr√≠a and atrium. The interior of the door is the most interesting part. *Chapel of Our Lady of the Snows, a late Gothic chapel with Baroque altar and altar paintings by Francisco Ximeno. *Chapel of San Valero (Valerius). Baroque entryway of gilded wood from the seventeenth century with scenes of the saints Valerius (patron of the city), Vincent, and Lawrence. Walls were painted by Garc√≠a Ferrer. *Chapel of Saint Helen, or the Chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament. The altar, entryway, and paintings by Francesco Lupicini of Florence are all Baroque works of the seventeenth century. *Chapel of the archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. The chapel was constructed by Garbriel Zaporta towards the end of the sixteenth century as a funerary chapel; only the lid of the sarcophagus has been preserved from that era. Dating from the Renaissance are altar decorations fashioned by Juan de Anchieta, bronze grating by Guill√©n Trujar√≥n, and the doorway. The paintings and mosaics are believed to be the work of the painter Pedro Morone of Siena. *Chapel of Santo Dominguito de Val, patron saint of the Infanticos. This Baroque chapel dates back to the second half of the eighteenth century and houses the remains of the saint himself. Elliptical cupola (dome) that arches over very detailed plaster pechinas (support structures of the cupola). *Chapel of St. Augustine. Renaissance-era altar decorations by Gil Morlanes with sculptures by Gabriel Yoly and Jos√© Sanz (image of St. Augustine from 1720) *Chapel of Saint Pedro Arbu√©s. On the walls appear framed paintings from the seventeenth century attributed to the artist Berdus√°n. Below a canopy (pavilion-like draping of fabric) with Solomonic columns is a sculpture of Saint Pedro Arbu√©s done by Juan Ram√≠rez in the seventeenth century. Baroque doorway from the eighteenth century. Beginning with the foot of the cathedral, the chapels on the left side: *Chapel of St. Bernard. This is one of the greatest works of the Aragonese Renaissance. Between 1549 and 1555, it contained the tombs of the archbishop Hernando de Arag√≥n, who ordered its construction, along with that of his mother Ana de Gurrea. Juan Vizca√≠no created the sepulchre of the archbishop, and Juan de Liceire did that of his mother. The altar decorations for the Chapel of San Bruno were entrusted to the sculptor Pedro de Moreto. All parts were made of alabaster. The grating is also from the Renaissance and was the work of Guill√©n Trujar√≥n. *Chapel of St. Benedict. Commissioned in Gothic style in the sixteenth century, the construction was delayed by Hernando de Arag√≥n in order to collect the bodies of his servants. *Chapel of St. Mark. *Chapel of the Birth of Christ. Simple doorway from the sixteenth century. Altar decorations with panels attributed to Roland de Mois or Jer√≥nimo de Mora from the sixteenth century. Renaissance grating by Hernando de √Åvila. *Chapel of Saints Justa and Rufina. Paintings by Juan Galv√°n hang over the walls. The painting of the saints was done by Francisco Camilo in 1644. *Chapel of St. Vincent. Baroque doorway. The sculpture of St. Vincent is from roughly 1760 and was created by Carlos Salas. *Chapel of St. James the Great (Santiago). A painting by Pablo Raviella from 1695. An image of St. James the pilgrim, from the 16th century, under a baroque canopy. Choir: *The choir section is formed by 117 oaken seats built by three monks named Gomar, Bernardo Giner, and Mateo de Cambiay. It is enclosed by a bronze grating accented with sculptures of gilded wood by Juan Ram√≠rez. The archbishop Dalmau Mir is buried here. *The organ preserves some remnants of the Gothic organ of 1469 and pipes hailing from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. The present-day organ is the result of the integration of the complex historical pieces of the instrument, done between 1857 and 1859 by Pedro Roqu√©s. *To the rear of the choir lies the chapel of the Holy Christ, with a representation of the crucified Christ, Mater Dolorosa (Mary) and St. John created by Arnau de Bruselas near the end of the sixteenth century; all of this is below a canopy supported by Solomonic columns of black marble. The decorations are the work of Jer√≥nimo Vallejo, Arnau de Bruselas, and Juan Sanz de Tudelilla, done in hardened plaster, and they form one of the most notable groups of sculpture from the Aragonese Renaissance. To the sides lie the small chapels of St. Martha, St. Matthew, St. John the Baptist, St. Thomas of Villanova, Nuestra Se√±ora de la Merced, Saint Leonard of Noblac, Saint Philip Neri, and Saint Orosia. Apses: *Chapel of the Virgen Blanca (White Virgin). Baroque altar decorations of wood with paintings by Jusepe Mart√≠nez (1647), a painter from Zaragoza. Alabaster sculpture of the Virgin with child from the fifteenth century made by the French sculptor Fortaner de Uesques. On the floor lie various tombstones of the archbishops of Zaragoza from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. *Main altar decorations. Dedicated to the Savior, it was originally created in alabaster and painted by various artists from 1434 to 1480, most notably Pere Johan, Francisco Gomar, and Hans Piet D'anso. It can be considered one of the greatest works of European Gothic sculpture. *Chapel of St. Peter and St. Paul.

Conservation Biology of Freshwater Turtles and Tortoises: A Compilation Project of the IUCN/SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group. Chelonian Research Monographs No. 5, pp. 031.1‚Äì031.8, is an east Australian species of snake-necked turtle that inhabits a wide variety of water bodies and is an opportunistic feeder. It is a side-necked turtle (Pleurodira), meaning that it bends its head sideways into its shell rather than pulling it directly back. Distribution The species is found throughout south eastern Australia where it is found west of Adelaide (South Australia) eastwards throughout Victoria and New South Wales, and northwards to the Fitzroy River of Queensland. Where these turtles come in contact with Chelodina canni they freely hybridise, exhibiting hybrid vigor in the Styx River Drainage of Queensland. Description The carapace is generally black in color, though some may be brown. It is broad and flattened with a deep medial groove. The scutes are edged in black in those individuals with a lighter background color. The plastron is also very broad and is cream to yellow in color with sutures edged in black. The neck is long and narrow, typical of the subgenus Chelodina, and reaches a length of approximately 60% of the carapace length. The neck has numerous small pointed tubercles and is grey to black in color dorsally, cream below, as is the narrow head. Females tend to grow to larger sizes and have deeper bodies. The maximum sizes recorded for females and males varies throughout the range, in river environments of the Murray it is and respectively, whereas in the Latrobe Valley it is and respectively. It is thought this is linked to productivity of the local environment. When it feels threatened, this turtle will emit an offensive smelling fluid from its musk glands. This trait gives the turtle one of its other common names, \\"stinker\\". The eastern long-necked turtle is carnivorous, eating a variety of animals. This includes insects, worms, tadpoles, frogs, small fish, crustaceans, and molluscs. Reproduction In early summer, the female will lay between two and ten eggs in the banks of her aquatic habitat. Three to five months later the hatchlings break out of their shells. These young turtles often fall prey to predators such as fish and birds. Females will lay one to three clutches of eggs per year.

The church was built between 1785 and 1806 in Zopf style. Its furniture is also in Zopf style, from the late 18th century. It is a listed historic monument. The church houses an iconostasis 16 m high, with 88 pictures of the life of Jesus. The Baroque iconostasis was carved in the workshop of Mikl√≥s Jankovits of Eger, the pictures (with the exception of four of them) were painted by Anton Kuchelmeister of Vienna. The copy of the Akhtyrka Icon of the Mother of God was a gift from Empress Catherine II of Russia. The Orthodox believers already had a small chapel in the early 18th century (St. Naum Chapel), which stood on today's Sz√©chenyi street. The building of the church was decided in the second part of the century. Originally they planned to build a large church with an onion dome, designed by Johannes Michart, but it was opposed by the (mainly Protestant) leaders of the city and by those who were accustomed to the more conservative artistic styles of the period. It was finally decided that the church would be built according to the design by Johann Michael Schajdlet. The interior is divided into three parts: entrance hall, naos, and sanctuary. A school (1805), a hospital and a parsonage were also built next to the church. The churchyard also served as a burial place, several of the marble tombstones are still there. The Orthodox Liturgical Museum of Hungary houses the richest Orthodox liturgical collection of Hungary. The museum was opened in the building of the former school in 1988. Its permanent exhibition shows the history and arts of the Orthodox Church and schools. The first room resembles a chapel, recalling the atmosphere of Greek chapels where believers worshiped before large Baroque churches were built. In the second room visitors can see goldsmith's work and liturgical clothes, while in the third room the icon collection is exhibited.

It is from via . Train services are provided by Southern. The station neighbours Plumpton Racecourse, which had its own platform at the end of the village station.  History  Plumpton lies on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway \\"cut-off\\" line between Keymer Junction, near Wivelsfield on the Brighton Main Line, and Lewes. The erstwhile Brighton, Lewes and Hastings Railway were authorised to build the line in 1845; the LBSCR purchased it and opened the link on 1 October 1847. However, there was no immediate demand for services and the station did not open until June 1863. The road crossing was established in 1849 and was hand operated until the establishment of the signal box in 1891. That signal box, now defunct (after being reduced to a crossing box under the supervision of Three Bridges PSB) after the crossing was given obstacle detection systems. It still remains and is a Grade II Listed Building.  Crossing Closure Controversy  Network Rail closed the level crossing in September 2015 so that the wooden, wheel worked gates (the last in East Sussex) on the crossing could be replaced. However, Lewes District Council rejected the plans to replace the gates as it would have caused \\"substantial harm to the significance of the signal box\\". Network Rail said that they could not open the crossing as the work was not completed. This effectively split the village in two, with some motorists having to take a six or seven mile detour. However the upgrade took place and the level crossing was reopened in February 2016.  Services  Services are supplied by Southern and are mainly hourly in each direction with the strengthening to half-hourly in the peak. During the day time there is 1 tph to Ore and London Victoria.

He is best known for his innovative approaches to teaching and learning mathematics (Visible & Tangible Math), foreign languages (The Silent Way) and reading (Words in Color). He is also the inventor of pedagogical materials for each of these approaches, and the author of more than 120 books and hundreds of articles largely on the topics of education and human development.  Background  Gattegno was born November 11, 1911 in Alexandria, Egypt. His parents Menachem Gattegno a Spanish merchant and Bchora, had nine children. Due to poverty, Gattegno and his siblings had to work at their young age. The mathematician had no formal education until he started to learn on his own at the age of 14. He took external examinations when he was 20 years old and obtained teaching license in physics and chemistry from the University of Marseille in Cairo. He moved to England where he became involved in teacher education and helped establish the Association of Teachers of Mathematics and the International Commission for the Study and Improvement of Mathematics Teaching. He taught at several universities such as the University of Liverpool and the University of London. Pedagogical approach Gattegno‚Äôs pedagogical approach is characterised by propositions based on the observation of human learning in many and varied situations. This is a description of three of these propositions. =Learning and effort= Gattegno noticed that there is an ‚Äúenergy budget‚Äù for learning. Human beings have a highly developed sense of the economics of their own energy and are very sensitive to the cost involved in using it. It is therefore essential to teach in ways that are efficient in terms of the amount of energy spent by learners. To be able to mathematically determine whether one method was more efficient than another, he created a unit of measurement for the effort used to learn. He called that unit an ogden, and one can only say an ogden has been spent if the learning was done outside of ordinary functionings, and was retained. For example, learning one word in a foreign language costs one ogden, but if the word cannot be recalled, the ogden has not truly been spent. Gattegno's teaching materials and techniques were designed to be economical with ogdens, so that the most information can be recalled with the least sense of effort. Certain kinds of learning are very expensive in terms of energy, i.e., ogdens, while others are practically free. Memorization is a very expensive way to learn. The energy cost can be especially high when the content is of no particular interest to the learner. Memorizing dates in history or major exports of foreign countries is like that, for most people. School is not the only place where that kind of learning is found. Learning somebody's name or telephone number is equally arbitrary. We have to use our own energy to make such arbitrary items stick in our memories. The ‚Äúmental glue‚Äù necessary is expensive, since that type of learning uses up a lot of energy. Not only is that type of learning expensive, it tends also to be fragile. It is typically difficult to remember those kinds of items. Even when we make a great effort, we do not always succeed. We often recognise a face without being able to remember the name of the person ... not to mention all that almost all of us have forgotten much of what we \\"learned\\" at school. It is not unusual for us to forget much of what we memorize. However, there is another way of functioning, which Gattegno called retention. An example of retention is the reception of sensory images. When we look at something ‚Äì a street, a film, a person, a fine view ‚Äì photons move from what we are contemplating and enter our eyes to strike the retina. When we listen to something, we create auditory images in a similar way, that is, through energy that enters our system, rather than energy we allocate from inside, to memorize an arbitrary item. To retain an auditory or visual image, we have to use perhaps only an insignificant amount of our own to retain it; the amount is so small we are not aware of any effort. Such images are easily acquired and generally remain for long periods. We all have experiences similar to the following examples Gattegno offered: First experience: \\"I recently visited a village in the south of France where I had not been for over 10 years and I was able to say, 'Oh, yes, I know. The pharmacy is over there beyond the baker‚Äôs.' I went to see and there it was. I had made no effort to memorise this village square. It had entered my mind during my previous visits and it had remained there.\\" Second experience: \\"I visit a supermarket and go down the aisles. I see an unexceptional woman with a trolley. Three aisles further on, I see her again. I have not tried to remember her, but I have seen her and I can recognise her again a little later.\\" Our system of retention is extremely efficient. We keep in our minds a huge quantity of information simply because we have seen, heard, tasted, smelled or felt it. That ability is part of human nature. It enables us to walk about our town without getting lost, to ski or to read a book. Gattegno proposed that we base education, not on memorization, which has a high energetic cost and is often unreliable, but on retention. The learning tools and techniques Gattegno proposed rely systematically on retention. =The subordination of teaching to learning= Gattegno argued that for pedagogical actions to be effective, teaching should be subordinated to learning, which requires that as an absolute prerequisite teachers must understand how people learn. Rather than present facts for memorization, teachers construct challenges for students to conquer. If the student cannot conquer the challenge easily, the teacher does not tell the answer, but observes and asks questions to determine where the confusion lies, and what awareness needs to be triggered in the student. The role of teachers is not to try to transmit knowledge, but to engender acts of awareness in their students, for only awareness is educable. Gattegno created pedagogical materials designed to provoke awarenesses. The materials are intended to be used along with techniques aimed at leading students through a succession of awarenesses. As the students progress, teachers who observe their students can see when and how they can induce a new act of awareness. For example, he created Words in Colour for learning to read. Briefly, it consists of a series of word charts using a colour code in which each colour represents a phoneme of the language. The charts are used to provoke the phonological awareness in students of the sounds they are making and the order in which they are making them thus engendering all the awarenesses of how the graphemes relate to the phonemes and of how the spatial order of writing reflects the chronological order of speech. Other charts, called Fidels, list the graphemes for each phoneme. He also used this colour code in The Silent Way materials for learning foreign languages to enable students to identify and produce the sounds of the new language. Cuisenaire rods are used, particularly with beginners, to create visible and tangible situations from which the students can induce the structures of the language. The silence of the teacher both gives the students room to explore the language and frees the teacher to observe the students. The teacher is thus able to propose a sequence of pedagogical challenges adapted precisely to the evolution of the students‚Äô learning. \\"If I would be remembered for anything\\", he said in one of his last seminars, \\"it would be that I painted the sounds with colours.\\" In his approach to teaching mathematics, manipulatives, such as Geoboards which he invented and Cuisenaire Rods which he popularised, are part of a way of systematically developing students‚Äô mathematical thinking through the exploration of clear and tangible problems. All the materials created by Gattegno were designed to allow teachers using them to place the accent systematically on the students‚Äô learning rather than on what they, the teachers, do. Teachers watch their students deal with the challenges they are given, and provide them with feedback on their trials and errors. Teachers thus actively base their work on the awareness and awarenesses of the students, in the here and now. It is therefore very difficult for a teacher to closely follow a detailed lesson-plan, since the students are actively exploring the domain and have the freedom to take the lesson wherever they need it to go. The class becomes a kind of guided improvisation in which the teacher launches a challenge at a suitable level for the students, and if necessary nudges them into the awarenesses they need to have in order to learn. This is the case whatever the subject being dealt with, and is what is meant by Gattegno‚Äôs expression, ‚Äúthe subordination of teaching to learning‚Äù. =Only awareness is educable= Gattegno found that only awareness is educable in human beings. On the path to learning, several awarenesses must be reached. The first is the awareness that there is something to be learned, some unknown to become known. The next awarenesses are triggered by experience with the subject matter. For example, rather than ask a student to write \\"2+2=4,\\" Gattegno might ask them to create the number 4 in as many ways as possible with colored rods. The student can then clearly see, feel, and describe the characteristics of the number 4. Instead of memorizing \\"2+2=4,\\" the student has had a mathematical experience, and become aware that \\"4\\" can be broken into parts, and that the process of breaking apart and putting together can be described in several ways. We are constantly becoming aware of new things. When it is something significant, the awareness is often audible in the form of the ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù so typical of an important realisation. However, most realisations are made much more discretely. Indeed, as we live our everyday lives, we become aware of all sorts of things at great speed throughout the day: the price of bananas, that these bananas are not ripe enough, that the price of the yoghurts has been reduced because they are close to their sell-by date ‚Ä¶. All our life is a succession of tiny awarenesses. Until we become aware of something, that thing remains totally unknown to us. As soon as we become aware of it and integrate it into our lives, we often no longer pay attention to it. But the moment of realisation, the act of learning, is an act of awareness. The role of the teacher in acts of learning is not to inform students of this or that piece of information, but to help them to discover it, to perform a conscious act to become aware of it. Gattegno suggests that learning takes place in four stages which can be described in terms of awareness. The first stage consists in a single act of awareness: the realisation that there is something new to be explored. As long as I am unaware that there is something to be known, I cannot start to learn. The second stage: As soon as I start to learn, I have to explore the situation in order to understand it. As I am not yet an expert in the field, I make many mistakes. These mistakes enable me to progress because by observing what happens and becoming aware of it I can adapt my attempts in relation to the feedback given by the environment. This stage ends when I know what I have to do, but I only succeed when I am wholly present in what I am doing. The third stage is a transitional stage. At the beginning, I am able to do what I want if I pay attention at each instant. At the end of this stage I no longer need to pay attention: the new skill has become completely automatic and because it is automatic, I am free to give my attention to learning other things. The fourth stage is that of transfer. For the rest of my life, what I have learnt can be used for all the new skills I may wish to acquire. When I learnt to run, I used the know-how I had acquired from learning to walk. Both of these, walking and running, were useful to me when I decided to learn cross-country skiing. Each skill remains available, except in the rare cases of accident or injury, for a lifetime.

Origins  Recorded as O'Keenan and more usually Keenan, this is an Irish surname. Found mainly in the Ulster and northern counties of Fermanagh and Monaghan, it originates from the ancient pre 10th century Gaelic name O' Cianain meaning \\"The descendant of the faithful one\\" or similar. It may not have been entirely coincidence that the clan was famous throughout the Medieval Period for producing both high-ranking members of the church, and early historians, in several cases the same thing. The first recorded scribe was Adam O' Caianain, who was also the canon of Lisgool in Fermanagh. He is mentioned in the annals known as the \\"Four Masters\\" as being the historian to the famous Maguires of County Fermanagh. It is said that in 1659 in Petty's Census of Ireland that the spelling was found as MacKeenan, but if so this spelling is now completely extinct and research suggests that the original recording may have been a clerical mistake.

Picket fences are a type of fence often used decoratively for domestic boundaries, distinguished by their evenly-spaced vertical boards, the pickets, attached to horizontal rails. Picket fences are particularly popular in the United States, with white picket fences symbolising the suburban middle class. History Picket fences are particularly popular in the United States, where the style has been used since America's earliest colonial era and remains popular today. Pickets were historically sharpened logs used to defend positions and used as such by early colonists. Now they are a decorative way to contain pets and children without blocking views, and are used around both front and back yards. Traditionally picket fences were made out of wood and painted white (or whitewashed), but now picket fences are also widely available in polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Until the introduction of advertising on fences in the 1980s, cricket fields were usually surrounded by picket fences, giving rise to the expression \\"rattling the pickets\\" for a ball hit firmly into the fence. Design A picket fence is usually 0.9 m to 1.2 m tall. A horizontal top rail and bottom rail are attached to fenceposts, which are installed upright into the ground. Evenly- spaced boards are affixed vertically to the rails. These boards with pointed tops are called \\"pickets\\" for their resemblance to the pointed stakes historically used by infantry to repel cavalry. Picket fences can be made of several types of materials. Historically, wood has been the most popular material used for picket fences. It can be untreated, treated, or naturally insect- and rot-resistant. Other options include polyvinyl chloride and aluminium. Installation The first step in installing a picket fence is to insert the posts into the ground. Traditionally this is done by digging deep holes (usually 36in x 12in) either manually or with a power auger. The posts are then placed upright into the ground and concrete is poured to cement them into place. Once they are set, the horizontal rails are affixed to the posts using fasteners, and finally the pickets can be attached to the horizontal rails. By far the most time-consuming part of installing a picket fence is setting the posts. There are some vinyl picket fence systems on the market that are installed without digging holes or pouring concrete. These are installed by driving pipe deep into the ground, which is how chain link fence has been installed for years. This is the most popular way to install vinyl fence in Western Canada, where the deep frost can heave concrete footings out of the ground. Symbolism A picket fence, ideally white, has iconic status as Americana, symbolizing the ideal middle-class suburban life, with a family and children, large house, and peaceful living. This stems from the fact that houses in quiet, middle-class neighborhoods often have gardens enclosed by picket fences.White Picket Fences. In recent years, some people have associated picket fences with what they regard as the more negative aspects of this lifestyle. For example, the director David Lynch uses ironic images of the picket fence in his 1986 film Blue Velvet.

The Belfast Harbour Police is a small, specialised police force with the responsibility of policing the Port of Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was founded in 1847, making it the oldest continuously-operating law enforcement agency in Ireland. Powers Officers of this force are sworn in as 'special constables' under section 79 of the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847. As a result, officers have the full powers of a constable on any land owned by the Belfast Harbour Authority and at any place within one mile (1.6 km) of any owned land. The extent of Belfast Harbour includes the George Best Belfast City Airport, though policing of the airport by the Harbour Police was discontinued in February 2009. The force comprised 28 constables, six sergeants and one chief officer in 2009. Whilst on duty, BHP officers are armed, which is believed to be a unique situation amongst the small number of privately owned ports police services across the United Kingdom. The service may also enforce the Belfast Harbour Commissioners' by-laws, giving them more powers specific to the harbour. Officers Belfast Harbour Police consists of uniformed police officers and a CID section who provide 24-hour cover throughout the 2000-acre Harbour Estate, including almost 17 miles of roads. Their vehicles are equipped with Tracker stolen vehicle detection devices. Officers are armed with the Glock 17 9mm pistol. Uniforms Unlike the green uniforms worn by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, BHP officers wear a black and white uniform, similar to those worn by police officers in the rest of the United Kingdom. Also unlike the PSNI, BHP also uses the standard black and white police sillitoe tartan insignia on their forage caps and the rank insignia for the rank of Sergeant incorporates the downturned chevrons, again similar to police agencies in the rest of the UK. Any major or serious crime and incidents such as murder, acts of terrorism or armed robbery are the responsibility of the local territorial police force, the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Equipment Like most Northern Ireland police or public security services, BHP officers are regularly armed and are equipped with the Glock 17, previously being equipped with six-shot revolvers.https://www.belfast- harbour.co.uk/uploads/media/default/0001/01/afb84b7f872ce959adb44d9ca72a42f86f04cb30.jpeg Officers also carry typical UK police equipment, including a radio, baton, incapcicant spray.

This was a relatively peaceful period, during which the Ottoman Empire began to orient itself towards Europe. The name of the period derives from the tulip craze among the Ottoman court society. Cultivating this culturally ambiguous emblem had become a celebrated practice.Ariel Salzmann, ‚ÄúThe age of tulips‚Äù, 84 The tulip period illustrated the conflicts brought by early modern consumer culture and was a shared material symbolism. During this period the elite and high-class society of the Ottoman period had established an immense fondness for the tulip, which were utilized in various occasions. Tulips defined nobility and privilege, both in terms of goods and leisure time.  Rise and growth  Drawing of a tulip by Abdulcelil Levni (1720) Under the guidance of Sultan Ahmed III's son-in-law, Grand Vizier Nev≈üehirli Damat ƒ∞brahim Pasha, the Ottoman Empire embarked on new policies and programs during this period, which established the first Ottoman language printing press during the 1720s, and promoted commerce and industry. The Grand Vizier was concerned with improving trade relations and enhancing commercial revenues, which would help to explain the return to gardens and the more public style of the Ottoman court during this period. The Grand Vizier was himself very fond of tulip bulbs, setting an example for Istanbul‚Äôs elite who started to cherish the tulip‚Äôs endless variety in paint and celebrate its seasonality as well.Ariel Salzmann, ‚ÄúThe age of tulips‚Äù, 93 The Ottoman standard of dress and its commodity culture incorporated their passion for the tulip. Within Istanbul, one could find tulips from the flower markets to the plastic arts to silks and textiles. (page 86) Tulip bulbs could be found everywhere; the demand grew within the elite community where they could be found in homes and gardens. Therefore, the tulip is a symbol with mythical appeal, which can be found from Ottoman palaces to their clothing, which sustains a memory of the Ottoman Empire‚Äôs social past. The tulip can be seen as a romantic monument representing the wealthy and elite, and the fragility of despotic rule.Ariel Salzmann, ‚ÄúThe age of tulips‚Äù, 97  Culture  The Fountain of Ahmed III is a classical example of Tulip period architecture The Tulip period saw a flowering of arts, culture and architecture. Generally the style of architecture and decoration became more elaborate, being influenced by the Baroque period in movement. A classic example is the Fountain of Ahmed III in front of Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. The architectural style is a fusion of classical Islamic elements with baroque European ones, making it into distinct Ottoman architecture of the 18th century. The tulip was also praised in poetry and motifs used in paintings. To this day in modern Turkey the tulip is still considered the embodiment of perfection and beauty.

These albums that Levni painted were called Tulip albums which mirrored the structure of the states itself, ranking distinguished members of the regime according to horticultural achievements.Ariel Salzmann, ‚ÄúThe age of tulips‚Äù, 93  Anti-Tulip Rebellion  Tulip prices began to rise in the last decades of the 17th century and peaked in 1726‚Äì1727 before state intervention. This reflected the demand for the inflated value of the rare bulbs and escalating demands for flowers in the elite‚Äôs palaces and gardens.Ariel Salzmann, ‚ÄúThe age of tulips‚Äù, 94 Tulip mania demonstrated the state's power to regulate the economy by increasing the prices for bulbs. Courtiers at the time forwarded a petition to denounce the practice of flower sellers, whom they perceived to be taking advantage of the elite by raising the prices of the bulbs. This led to the process of issuing inventories of flowers and price lists to the judge of Istanbul for enforcement.Ariel Salzmann, The age of tulips, 95  See also  * Abdulcelil Levni * Culture of the Ottoman Empire * Jean-Baptiste van Mour  Notes   References  * Salzmann, Ariel. 2000. \\"The Age of Tulips Confluence and Conflict in Early Modern Consumer Culture (1550‚Äì1730).\\" In Consumption Studies and the History of the Ottoman Empire, 1550‚Äì1922.

Located at Andrew Square in South Boston, it serves the MBTA Red Line and the MBTA bus system. Named for John Albion Andrew, the square is at the intersection of several major thoroughfares: Dorchester Avenue, Dorchester Street, Southampton Street, and Boston Street. Andrew is the primary transfer point between the Red Line subway and the MBTA surface bus routes into South Boston. Opened in 1918 and renovated in 1994, it is fully accessible. History Andrew station under construction in April 1917 A route trolley at the surface station in the 1940s The station opened in June 1918 as the southern terminus of the Cambridge‚ÄìDorchester line, and quickly replaced Broadway as the primary streetcar transfer point for South Boston. A multiple track streetcar station was built on the surface, with direct connections from the rapid transit platforms. Andrew was the terminus of the line until November 1927, when Columbia, Savin Hill, and Fields Corner stations opened on the Ashmont branch. The fare mezzanines and staircases were reconfigured over the years as streetcars were replaced by trackless trolleys and later buses. Streetcars and trackless trolleys entered the surface station from Dorchester Avenue, but after bustitution in 1962 the traffic direction was reversed. From its opening of the South Shore line on September 1, 1971, until the second platform at opened on December 14, 1988, Andrew was the southernmost transfer point between the Ashmont and South Shore (Braintree) branches of the Red Line. The platforms were extended in the mid 1980s to allow six-car trains, but the station itself was deteriorating. After political requests and lobbying efforts by the local community, the station underwent extensive renovation from 1990 to 1993 with a new bus shed and underground connections, including a crossover mezzanine between the Red Line platforms. Work began in September 1990; the station was closed nights and some weekends until March 1991 during the heaviest work. Construction on the busway finished in January 1994. The rebuilt station incorporates elevators to the platforms to provide full handicapped accessibility. The station includes the Andrew Station Time Capsule, a public art installation by Ross Miller, consisting of 14 stainless steel boxes suspended over the tracks, which contain items collected from riders during station renovation in 1993. The boxes are to be opened in 2068, 75 years after their installation.

Early life Spada was born in Brisighella, current province of Ravenna (Romagna). His father was the rich merchant Paolo Spada (unrelated to the Spada family of ancient nobility) who had directed him early on to a career in the church, though the generations before his had been colliers. Bernardino studied law in Bologna, Perugia and Rome and received a doctorate. He served in the Papal Curia from 1617. Ecclesiastic career On 8 December 1623, he was consecrated bishop in the church of S. Luigi de' Francesi in Rome by Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio d'Aragona, assisted by Guillaume du Nozet, Titular Archbishop of Seleucia, and by Fran√ßois Boyvin de P√©ricard, Bishop of Evreux. In December 1623 he was appointed papal nuncio to the court of France, in preparation for which he was ordained titular archbishop of Tamiathis. He served as nuncio until 1627, when he became papal legate in Bologna. He was made a cardinal 19 January 1626 by Pope Urban VIII. When the plague epidemic hit Bologna in 1630/1631, he helped organize the health care system there. From 1631 he served again in Rome, filling several influential positions in the Curia. In 1632 he purchased what is now called the Palazzo Spada in the rione Regola, facing Piazza Capo di Ferro with a garden looking over the Tiber, and commissioned Francesco Borromini to modify it for him in a more Baroque style, to house his growing collections. War of Castro During the First War of Castro he served as plenipotentiary of Pope Urban VIII; sent to negotiate a truce with the Duchy of Parma, together with his brother Virgilio. Spada successfully negotiated a truce but when the pope's military leaders became aware that the dukes were massing troops to counter their troops (in case discussions with Spada came to naught), Urban VIII declared the articles of peace null and void and claimed Spada had negotiated them without his consent.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Spada was furious and later published a manifesto detailing his version of events which, according to contemporary John Bargrave, many accepted to be the truth. Andrea Casale In his profile of Spada, from his own observations and those of others, Bargrave also recounts Spada's dealings with Bologna nobleman Andrea Casale. Casale had been sent to Germany to fight in the armies of the Holy Roman Empire during the 30 Years' War where he was captured. While a prisoner, Casale inherited a large estate which Spada then came to manage on behalf of Casale's relatives (who expected Casale to never return). Casale was eventually released and returned to Bologna where he had great difficulty proving he was, in fact, Andrea Casale. But a nurse who had treated Casale as a young man came forward and identified him from specific marks on his body. Nonetheless, Spada had the man imprisoned where he was beaten to death. Bargrave recounted that the story had been told to him in Rome, \\"much to the Cardinal's disadvantage\\". Later ecclesiastic career Spada was successively Bishop of Albano, Frascati, Sabina and Palestrina. Bernardino supported the church careers of several of his family members. His nephew Giovanni Battista Spada became cardinal in 1654 and his great-nephew Fabrizio Spada became cardinal in 1675 and Cardinal Secretary of State in 1691. He died in Rome in 1661 and was interred in the family grave in the church of San Girolamo della Carit√†.

He played wide receiver in the National Football League for the New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers and college football at Xavier University.  Early life  Born in Bellingham, WA, Abramowicz is of Polish descent. He attended Steubenville Catholic Central High School. When he was a 5-10, 155-pound senior at Catholic Central, Abramowicz didn't attract much attention from college coaches. The only school that offered him a football scholarship was Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. He went to Xavier and, as a sophomore, caught 18 passes for 257 yards in his first varsity season. His junior year, he finished with 50 catches for 738 yards and eight touchdowns, helping Xavier to an 8-2 season. That year Xavier knocked off Miami University, 29-28, Cincinnati, 14-3, and Dayton, 10-0. The Musketeers were all but bowl-bound until they dropped a 57-33 decision to Texas Western on the final day of the season despite a 53-yard touchdown reception by Abramowicz. At the conclusion of his junior year, he was named to the All- Catholic All-America team (The Brooklyn Tablet). During his senior season, he continued as the favorite receiver of quarterback Carroll Williams, catching 34 passes for 585 yards and three touchdowns despite facing constant double coverage.http://www.goxavier.com/genrel/abramowicz_daniel00.html Abramowicz holds the XU records for passes caught in a season (50 in 1965) and in a career (102), yards gained through passes caught in a career (1,470), as well as touchdown passes caught in a season (eight in 1965) and in a career (13)http://www.lasportshall.com/inductees/football/danny- abramowicz/?back=inductee He graduated with a bachelor of science degree in Economics and Education in 1967.  NFL career  By his senior year, he had grown to 6-0, 190 pounds, but he still didn't attract much attention from pro scouts due to his lack of speed. Abramowicz was drafted by the Saints in the 17th round of the 1967 NFL Draft. His career lasted from 1967 through 1974. Abramowicz broke into the starting lineup in the seventh game of the Saints‚Äô first season with 12 catches for 156 yards in a 14-10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Additionally, in 1968 and 1972 he was Top 10 in receiving touchdowns. His best season is generally considered to be 1969 when he caught 73 passes for 1,015 yards to go along with seven touchdowns. For his efforts, he was voted as an All-Pro by the Sporting News and Associated Press. The 1972 season would turn out to be Abramowicz's last full season with the Saints. Two games into the 1973 season, he was traded to the 49ers, playing two sub-par seasons. Abramowicz attempted to catch on in 1975, reporting to camp with George Allen's \\"Over the Hill Gang\\", the Washington Redskins. However, he did not make the final roster. Over his career, he played 111 games, caught 369 passes for 5,686 yards, and 39 touchdowns. Upon his retirement, he held the NFL record for catching at least one pass in consecutive games: 105.

The highway begins in the Eastern region of city of S√£o Paulo and ends at the county of Guararema, merging with Rodovia Presidente Dutra. The cities served by Rodovia Ayrton Senna are Guarulhos, Itaquaquecetuba, Mogi das Cruzes, Suzano, Po√° and Guararema. It continues in the same direction into Rodovia Carvalho Pinto, which has the same SP-070 designation, in parallel with Dutra Highway. Near S√£o Paulo, special highway engineering techniques had to be used, in order to cross the natural swamp area by the Tiet√™ River without damaging the nearby ecosystem. Its main traffic nowadays is between S√£o Paulo and the S√£o Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport (also known as Cumbica Airport). The highway is named in honour of the deceased Brazilian Formula One driver, Ayrton Senna. It was managed and maintained by DERSA, a state-owned company, until June 18, 2009. It is now maintained by Ecopistas, but it is a toll road.  Story  On August 3, 1979, Decree No. 13,756, gave concession to DERSA for construction and exploration of the Eastern Road, now called the Ayrton Senna Highway. The highway, former Trabajadores, had the first stretch of S√£o Paulo-Guararema built by DERSA in 22 months - from June 1980 to April 30, 1982 -, has a length of 48.3 km, to which were added 5, corresponding to the interconnection with the Presidente Dutra Highway in which it has the name of Access SP 070 / BR-116. The inauguration took place on May 1, 1982. The work met a historical need, determined by the growth of the S√£o Paulo Metropolitan Region with access to the Tiet√™ Ecological Park, S√£o Paulo / Guarulhos International Airport and Intermodal Cargo Terminal. In addition to alleviating the traffic that congested the Presidente Dutra Highway in the busiest section (S√£o Paulo- Guarulhos), the Highway became the long-needed alternative between the city of S√£o Paulo and the Vale do Para√≠ba and Rio de Janeiro. It also began to facilitate tourism to the North Coast and Campos do Jord√£o.

Forced perspective gallery by Francesco Borromini. The corridor is much shorter, and the sculpture much smaller, than they appear. The Palazzo Spada is a palace located on Piazza di Capo Ferro #13 in the rione Regola of Rome, Italy. Standing very close to the Palazzo Farnese, it has a garden facing towards the Tiber river. The palace accommodates a large art collection, the Galleria Spada. The collection was originally assembled by Cardinal Bernardino Spada in the 17th century, and by his brother Virgilio Spada, and added to by his grandnephew Cardinal Fabrizio Spada, History In 1540, the palace was commissioned by Cardinal Girolamo Capodiferro, and utilized as an architect Bartolomeo Baronino of Casale Monferrato, while Giulio Mazzoni and a team provided lavish external and internal stucco-work. The palace was briefly owned by the Mignanelli family, until in 1632, the palace was purchased by Cardinal Spada, who commissioned modifications from Francesco Borromini. The Baroque architect Borromini who created a masterpiece of forced perspective optical illusion in the arcaded courtyard, in which diminishing rows of columns and a rising floor create the visual illusion of a gallery 37 meters long (it is 8 meters) with a life-size sculpture at the end of the vista, in daylight beyond: the sculpture is 60 cm high. Borromini was aided in his perspective trick by a mathematician. The Mannerist stucco sculptural decor of the palazzo's front and its courtyard fa√ßades feature sculptures crowded into niches and fruit and flower swags, grotesques and vignettes of symbolic devices (impresi) in bas-relief among the small framed windows of a mezzanine, the richest cinquecento fa√ßades in Rome. Facade details. The colossal sculpture of Pompey the Great, erroneously believed to be the very one at whose feet Julius Caesar fell, was discovered under the party wall of two Roman houses in 1552: it was to be decapitated to satisfy the claims of both parties, which appalled Cardinal Capodiferro so, that he interceded on the sculpture's behalf with Pope Julius III, who purchased it and then gave it to the Cardinal. The palazzo hosts the Galleria Spada, the Cardinal Spada's collection, which includes four galleries of 16th and 17th-century paintings by Andrea del Sarto, Guido Reni, Titian, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Guercino, Rubens, D√ºrer, Caravaggio, Domenichino, the Carracci, Salvator Rosa, Parmigianino, Francesco Solimena, Michelangelo Cerquozzi, Pietro Testa, Giambattista Gaulli, and Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, and has the additional interest of being hung in the 17th-century manner, frame-to-frame, with smaller pictures \\"skied\\" above larger ones.

The station was handed over to Royal Malaysian Air Force in 1961. During the height of the Emergency, the single runway had the highest number of aircraft movements in the world. The station was situated about 3 miles from the town with its own swimming pool and cinema. It is commonly known to the locals as Sungai Besi Air Force Base. Civilian The airfield was also the site of the first civil airport, Sungai Besi Airport, which had a route to London with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) using Britannia aircraft. The airport opened in about 1957. Malayan Airways operated Dakota aircraft on domestic flights. The Duke of Gloucester was greeted at the airport by the British High Commissioner in Malaya, Sir Donald Charles MacGillivray, when Malaya was granted independence (\\"Merdeka\\"). Sungai Besi Airport was in use as a civilian airport long before 1957, with Malayan Airways Airspeed Consuls and DC3's flying in and out of the airport from the late 1940s. BOAC Argonauts used the airport in the early 1950s, after the Marsden Matting runway and taxiways were replaced by asphalt. A new terminal building was built in 1957 and this may be the source of confusion as to the date the airport was opened. This building was demolished around 2004.

These \\"Bermuda Principles\\" (also known as the \\"Bermuda Accord\\") contravened the typical practice in the sciences of making experimental data available only after publication. These principles represent a significant achievement of private ordering in shaping the practices of an entire industry and have established rapid pre-publication data release as the norm in genomics and other fields.

Launched in 1916, before going into service for Russia, the ship first served in the Royal Navy during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. It was eventually acquired by the Soviet Union and served through World War II, and was finally scrapped in 1977. Ship history The ship, ordered by the Russian Empire, was laid down in June 1916 by Armstrong Whitworth at Newcastle upon Tyne as the St. Alexander Nevsky, after Russian statesman and military hero Alexander Nevsky. Her construction was supervised by Russian naval architect and author Yevgeny Zamyatin. (updates articles by Myers published in Slavonic and East European Review) The ship was launched on 23 December 1916, and completed in June 1917. By then though the Russian Empire had ceased to exist following the February Revolution, and the ship was requisitioned by the Royal Navy and commissioned as HMS Alexander in September 1917. Alexander served in the North Russia campaign, and was handed over to White Russian forces when the British withdrew in October 1919. In Russian service The ship must have been soon taken by the Bolsheviks, for in 1921 the Norwegian sailor and Arctic explorer Otto Sverdrup commanded the ship, now named Lenin, at the request of the Soviet government, when he mounted his fourth and last expedition in Arctic Siberian waters. He led a convoy of five cargo ships on an experimental run through the Kara Sea to the mouths of the Ob and Yenisei Rivers. The ships reached their destinations and returned safely. This was considered an important step in the development of the Kara Sea sector of the Northern Sea Route. In 1937 Lenin was trapped in ice. She and her convoy of five ships spent an enforced winter in the Laptev Sea. They were finally rescued by the icebreaker Krasin in August 1938. During World War II the Lenin took part in Russian convoys in the Arctic. In 1942 the Lenin was part of a convoy spotted at the Mona Islands in the Kara Sea by a Kriegsmarine Arado Ar 196 during Operation Wunderland. The heavy cruiser rushed to find it, but bad weather, fog, and ice saved Lenin from destruction. The Lenin continued in service during the Cold War, but in 1957, when the nuclear- powered icebreaker Lenin was launched, it was renamed Vladimir Ilich Lenin. The ship was hulked in 1968, and finally scrapped in 1977. In popular fiction In his dystopian novel We, Zamyatin refers to the specifications of St. Alexander Nevsky in the names of some of his characters.

It lies in the upper Lune Valley, at the head of the Lune Gorge. Tebay had a population of 776 at the 2011 Census. Old Tebay lies to the north of Tebay at . Historically a sheep farming area, the arrival of the railway led to increased prosperity. History Castle Howe To the north, occupying a strategic position by the River Lune, now close to the M6 motorway, are the earthwork remains of a motte and bailey castle known as Castle Howe. During the Roman occupation a Roman road followed the course of the River Lune linking the Roman fort at Low Borrowbridge near Tebay with one at Over Burrow south of Kirkby Lonsdale. Another road, recently discovered using LIDAR, linked the fort at Low Borrowbridge with the fort to the north at Kirkby Thore, and thence to Whitley Castle and then Carvoran on Hadrian's Wall. Tebay was the home of the prophetess Mary Baynes, known as the 'Witch of Tebay', who died in 1811. Transport =Railways= 46100 Royal Scot attacking Shap Summit with a railtour nearby to Tebay Services in April 2016 Tebay railway station was on the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, which was built to link those two cities between 1844 and 1846, and which was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway in 1879. Tebay became an important junction for, in 1861, the Stainmore Railway, from Tebay-Kirkby Stephen- Barnard Castle and later becoming part of the North Eastern Railway, brought traffic from the east; it was closed in 1962. The A685 runs over much of its trackbed east from Tebay towards Kirkby Stephen. The Ingleton Branch Line of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway connecting via the Midland Railway to Settle and Leeds, enters the main line at the south end of the Lune Gorge; it was built in the 1850s, and was last used for passengers in the winter 1962-63 as a relief to the main line. The railway companies provided much employment for local people and this brought about the construction of housing to accommodate the increased population. The village has had two railway accidents happen nearby. On 15 February 2004, four people were run over by a maintenance vehicle in the Tebay rail accident. Three years later, the Grayrigg rail crash happened on 23 February 2007 between Oxenholme and Tebay on the West Coast Main Line. =Roads= Junction 38 of the M6 lies just west of the village, south of the notoriously exposed Shap Summit. Like its predecessor, the main railway line, it uses the upper reaches of the River Lune to pass through the fells. Tebay Services is one of the very few motorway service stations to be run independently, and has often won praise for its food. Village Terraced cottages at Tebay built for railway workers and their families, as seen from the West Coast Main Line in 2016 Central to the village is the Railway Club, which provides a concrete link to the past importance of the village. The Cross Keys pub in the village also provide a place where the inhabitants can come together. In times past, much of the populace was involved with the railway.

In 1569 he was named Vicar general to Cardinal Louis de Lorraine de Guise in the abbey of Tournus.

Coat of Arms of Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld, Cardinal of the Holy Catholic Church Cardinalate La Rochefoucauld was elevated to Cardinal in 1607. He was appointed Cardinal-Priest of San Callisto on 1 February 1610 at the age of 51,\\"Cardinals Created by Paul V\\" GCatholic.org shortly before moving to the See of Senlis. From September 1618 until 6 February 1632 he was Grand Almoner of France, and during this period was named papal commissioner for the reform of the old religious orders in France on 8 April 1622. He was President of the Royal Council from 1622 until his replacement by Cardinal Armand Richelieu in 1624. He served as abbot of Sainte-Genevi√®ve between 1619 and 1644. In February 1619, Louis XIII appointed de La Rochefoucauld to Sainte-Genevi√®ve in an effort to mitigate the effects of previous canons. The canons had been lax and Cardinal Rochefoucauld selected Charles Faure to follow out his wishes for reform. By 1635, La Rochefoucauld had tired of the cardinalate, and perhaps of the politics of the Church at that time, and wished to end his life not as a cardinal but as a simple member of the Jesuits. He communicated his desire to resign the cardinalate and enter the Jesuits to the current General of the Society, Father Muzio Vitelleschi. Vitelleschi obtained the consent of Cardinal-Nephew Antonio Barberini, but Pope Urban VIII turned down the request. La Rochefoucauld remained a cardinal until the end of his life at 86 years of age, on 14 February 1645, at his old abbey at Sainte-Genevi√®ve. Father Vitelleschi took the cardinal's Jesuit vows on his deathbed.

It is surrounded by, but not part of, the municipality of Huron Shores, and is part of Algoma District. The main industries are timber and tourism. The town is a popular retirement community. It is the administrative headquarters of the Thessalon First Nation an Ojibwe First Nations with a reserve, Thessalon 12. History Circa 1905 Appears on early maps as Tessalon (Galin√©e, 1670), and later as Pointe aux Thessalons (Bellin, 1775). A corruption of an earlier Amerindian descriptive Neyashewun, meaning \\"a point of land\\". The region was first surveyed in 1869. The survey was done to determine if the area could support a viable lumber industry. By the winter of 1870 the beginnings of a lumber camp had taken root and in 1877 a more permanent settlement was established. Thessalon was incorporated in 1892. Nathaniel Dyment of Barrie, the owner of Dyment Co. one of the earliest and most prominent lumber companies in the area is considered the founding figure of Thessalon. Recreation There is an arena, a curling club and one primary school in the town. The town was also home to the Thessalon Flyers. The Voyageur Hiking Trail passes near the community. The Thessalon River flows through the town and into Lake Huron at Water Street. Fishing is excellent in the river: yellow perch, pickerel, bass, northwater salmon and muskie.

Biography Born as Mykola Fitilyov in Trostyanets, Kharkov Governorate to a Russian laborer father and Ukrainian schoolteacher mother. In 1916 he graduated from the Bohodukhiv Gymnasium, in 1919 he joined the Communist Party. In the same year he became the chief of local Cheka in Bohodukhiv povit. He moved to Kharkiv in 1921 and involved himself with writers connected to Vasyl Blakytny and the paper Visti VUTsVK (news from All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee). In 1921, with Volodymyr Sosiura and Maik Yohansen, he signed the literary manifesto ‚ÄòOur Universal to the Ukrainian Workers and Ukrainian Proletarian Artists‚Äô (published in the collection Zhovten‚Äô). In the same year his poem ‚ÄòV elektrychnyi vik‚Äô (In the Electrical Age) and his poetry collection Molodist‚Äô (Youth) were published. In 1922, he began to focus more on prose writing. His initial collections Syni etiudy (Blue Etudes, 1923) and Osin‚Äô (Autumn, 1924) generated approval from critics like Serhiy Yefremov, , , and Dmytro Dontsov. His impressions of the work as a CheKa officer are reflected in his 1924 novel \\"I (Romance)\\", the hero of which - the head of the local Cheka - sentenced his mother to death in the name of the ideals of the revolution. Briefly a brief member of the literary organization (Hardening), Khvylovy later became critical of it and became a key leader of the VAPLITE organization of Ukrainian \\"proleteriat\\" writers. In April 1933 the secret police arrested Mykhailo Yalovy ‚Äì former head of VAPLITE, closest companion and ally of Khvylovy. Yalovy died in prison. Because of Stalin's repressions against his friends in the pro-Ukrainian Communist movement, Khvylovy committed suicide on 13 May 1933 in front of his friends in his apartment in Kharkiv. His suicide note said: \\"Arrest of Yalovy - this is the murder of an entire generation ... For what? Because we were the most sincere Communists? I don't understand. The responsibility for the actions of Yalovy's generation lies with me, Khvylovy. Today is a beautiful sunny day. I love life - you can't even imagine how much. Today is the 13th. Remember I was in love with this number? Terribly painful. Long live communism. Long live the socialist construction. Long live the Communist Party.\\" After his death, his works were banned in the Soviet Union and because of his symbolic potency were mostly not permitted until near the end or after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Works Khvylovy wrote both poetry and short stories. His short stories are best known for their difficult narrative forms and complicated imagery. A novel, titled Valdshnepy (The Woodsnipes), remained unfinished and unpublished when he died. Its second part ‚Äî the first published in Vaplite in 1927 ‚Äî had been confiscated. He wrote a number of pamphlets presenting his views of the connection between politics and art. He advocated an orientation toward cultural trends in Western Europe in order in loosen Ukraine's dependence on Russian forms and inspiration. His pamphlets created a major controversy and divided representatives of the budding Ukrainian literary scene and created tensions with the authorities. In the second series, Dumky proty techyi (Thoughts against the Current), which appeared in Kul‚Äôtura i pobut in November‚ÄìDecember 1925 and separately in 1926, Khvylovy further developed his argument against the ‚Äòcult of epigonism.‚Äô By adopting a psycho-intellectual orientation on Europe, he argued, Ukrainians can enter onto their own path of development. Leaving aside poetry, from which the writer soon turned to prose, the work of M. Khvylevy following G. A. Kostyuk can be divided into three periods: 1921-1924 - the time of the experiment and the search, to which the plotless romantic, lyrical, everyday satirical studies and the stories ‚ÄúLife‚Äù (Zhittya), ‚ÄúPuss in Boots‚Äù (Kit at Chobotyakh), ‚ÄúOn the Deaf Road‚Äù (On the Deaf Hat) belong, ‚ÄúEditor Clark‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlue Leaf Fall‚Äù (Blue Leaf Fall), ‚ÄúPig‚Äù (Pig), ‚ÄúArabesques‚Äù, the short story ‚ÄúI‚Äù and others. 1925-1930 - the period of creative maturity, the statement of style, theoretical understanding of art and a clear focus on the plot: the satirical stories ‚ÄúIvan Ivanovich‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Examiner‚Äù, the socio-psychological novel ‚ÄúFrom Variable Biography‚Äù (Iz Varino√Ø biografi√Ø), the novel ‚ÄúMother‚Äù (Mati), the story \\"Sanatorium zone\\" (The story about the sanatorium zone) and the novel \\"Woodcocks\\", polemic pamphlets \\"Kamo ryadesh?\\", \\"Ukraine or Little Russia?\\" and so on. 1931-1933 - ‚Äúthe period of heroic patience‚Äù, the period of defeats, retreats, and recent attempts to find a place in the new emerging mainstream. A number of critics believe that after abandoning his views in penitential letters, Khvylova ceased to exist as a writer. Then Khvylovoy tried to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the party leadership and dissociated himself from Khvylevism. The writer became entangled in a dangerous game and lost in a fight with the party leadership. Hopelessness led to a tragic ending. Dontsov believed that even if Khvylyova himself pressed the trigger of the revolver, Moscow put the weapon in his hand. The last stage of his work includes ‚ÄúHunting Stories‚Äù (Mislivsky Opovidannya; the writer was an avid hunter), ‚ÄúFrom the Laboratory‚Äù (3 laborers), ‚ÄúFuture Miners‚Äù (Maybutny Shakhtari), etc. External links * I am (romance) * Khvylovy Mykola * Khvylovy Mykola 1893 births 1933 deaths People from Trostianets Raion, Sumy Oblast People from Kharkov Governorate Communist Party of the Soviet Union members Ukrainian writers Cheka Ukrainian male writers Suicides by firearm in the Soviet Union Executed Renaissance ","title":"Mykola Khvylovy"},{"id":"2856416","text":"The Reformed Great Church of Debrecen The Reformed Great Church or Great Reformed Church in Debrecen () is located in the city of Debrecen. It stands in the city centre, between Kossuth square and Kalvin square. It is the symbol of the Protestant Church in Hungary, and it is because of this church that Debrecen is sometimes referred to as \\"the Calvinist Rome\\". With a ground space of 1500 m¬≤ it is the largest Protestant church in Hungary. It also has the largest bell of all Hungarian Protestant churches. The Great Church was built between 1805 and 1824 in neoclassical style. History The chair of Kossuth in the Great Protestant Church of Debrecen (1848) A church already stood here in the Middle Ages, but it burnt down. St. Andrew Church, a Gothic hall church was built in its place between 1297 and 1311. Its area was about 16x46 meters. This church burnt down in 1564. In 1626 the already Protestant citizens of Debrecen started to build the St. Andrew Church again. With the support of George I R√°k√≥czi construction was finished in 1628. In 1640-1642 a tower was constructed and a large bell ‚Äì about 300 kg, made of Austrian cannonballs ‚Äì was placed in it. In 1707, during the freedom fight led by Francis II R√°k√≥czi the church suffered heavy damages from the imperial troops. The church burnt down on June 11, 1802, during the great fire which destroyed most of Debrecen. The construction of the Great Church began on April 8, 1805. It was designed by Mih√°ly P√©chy, but the plans were altered several times during the construction, causing much frustration to the builders. The original plan featured a church with a cross-shaped ground plan and a large dome, but the plan was discarded, mainly due to financial reasons. The western tower was finished by 1818, the eastern tower on August 6, 1821. The towers are 61 meters high. Originally a dome was planned to crown the building, this was not built, but when the construction was finished, the facade seemed unattractive with the large empty space between the towers, so in 1823/24 the facade was slightly modified, using the plans of K√°roly R√°bl. The tower roofs feature Baroque elements. A nice panorama can be seen from the left (western) tower. The old R√°k√≥czi bell, restored after the fire, is in this tower too. Architecture The organ The main nave of the church is 55 m long and nearly 15 m wide, the transept is 38 m long and more than 14 m wide. Similar to other Protestant churches, the inside walls are painted white. The interior is 21 meters high. The church accommodates about 5000 people (with 3000 seats). The Great Church also has historical significance: during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Lajos Kossuth made the Hungarian Declaration of Independence here on April 14, 1848, and was elected governor of the country here. The armchair in which he sat can be viewed in the church. The church has two organs, one of them is in the southern part, above the main entrance. This is a new, electronic organ with resonance pipes, three manuals and 52 registers, built by P√©ter Albert in 1981. The older, Classical organ is behind the pulpit. It was built in 1838 by Jakob Deutschmann. It is a cabinet organ with 3 manuals and 43 registers.

The Entercom outlet broadcasts at 98.7 MHz and uses the slogan \\"We Play Everything!\\" WSMW broadcasts with an ERP of 100,000 watts at a height above average terrain of 375 meters (1230 feet). The signal provides secondary coverage as far as Charlotte to the south and Raleigh to the east.Radio- Locator.com The station's studios are located near the Piedmont Triad International Airport and the transmitter site is in unincorporated south Guilford County. History =Early Years= On January 9, 1958, WMDE first signed on at 98.5 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-151 Owner Hall Electronics originally used the experimental call sign W4MDE. In the early 1960s, WMDE moved to 98.7, a frequency used from 1948 to 1950 by WCTP. Early formats on WMDE included classical music, middle of the road music and jazz. In 1966, WMDE played country music and aired Tobacco Radio Network news. Suburban Broadcasting sold WMDE to Mido Broadcasting in 1973 and the station became WPET-FM, airing Southern gospel music as a sister station to AM 950 WPET. =The WRQK Era= Starting in November 1973, the station increased power to 100,000 watts and went with a Top 40/Oldies format referred to as \\"Rock N' Gold\\" with the call letters WRQK. Artists included Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Parliament, General Johnson and the Chairmen of the Board. Studios for WRQK and WPET were on Meadowview Road near the Greensboro Depot. Drivers passing by could see the DJs through the three glass walls, and some even yelled their requests to the DJs. Battleground Avenue had billboards showing the DJs. At one time the station's name was K-99. WRQK leaned toward classic rock in 1980, when it was also called \\"Heart of Gold\\".\\"Battle for Big Bucks,\\" Greensboro Daily News, April 27, 1980. Later the name became \\"99-RQK.\\" In 1983, rival station 99.5 WMAG made its debut, giving away a Rolls Royce. WRQK co-owner Tom Armshaw countered by giving away a blue Corvette. =Switch to Kiss-FM= In 1985, WRQK changed to WKSI \\"98-7 Kiss FM,\\" under consultant Randy Kabrich. The station was still playing Contemporary Hits and enjoying the \\"hey day\\" of 1980's top 40 popularity. The station was programmed during the mid/late 80's by Big Steve Kelly and then Dale O'Brian. O'Brian was hired as the Music Director and night jock following the departure of Dave Denver. O'Brian later hosted mornings following the departure of Jim Quinn. Big Steve left the station for Cleveland in the late 80's and O'Brian was named PD/Operations Manager. The station enjoyed the reputation of being one of the leading Top 40 stations in the Carolinas. In 1989, O'Brian left to sign on WMXF/MIX 96 in Fayetteville, NC. Other alumni include Dave Stone, Kelly Masters, Beth Ann McBride, Sammy Simpson, Scott Robbins, Sean Michaels, Ken Morrison, Robin Lambert, Skip Presson and Nancy Lee. The station would evolve to a modern rock-leaning Adult Top 40 by 1995 (after a brief stint as a country station \\"98-7 Kiss Country\\"). The station would also change its slogan to \\"The Point\\" in 1997 and by 2002 changed it again to \\"The Zone\\" along with the new call letters WOZN. =Move to Adult Hits= In 2005, the station added songs from the variety hits genre and held an online vote to see in the station should keep its Hot AC format or change to Adult Hits (even though at the time, the owners were planning to change it anyway.) Perhaps not surprisingly, Adult Hits won, with the station changing its call sign to WSMW and joining the list of stations embracing the format by introducing \\"Simon\\" to the market, not unlike the Jack FM format that was popular in many cities. The name \\"Simon\\" is a reference to the children's game \\"Simon Says,\\" where Simon gets to say whatever songs he'd like to hear from the music library. The station later added a morning show hosted by Jeff Wicker, voted \\"best Triad radio personality\\" for 2007 on GoTriad.com. Wicker's co-hosts were \\"Skip the Prize Guy\\" & Carmen Brown. Currently, weekdays begin with the \\"Get Up! Show,\\" hosted by Sean Sellers, a native of Henderson, NC, who had been a DJ at WDCG, a top 40 station in the Raleigh market, as well as stops in the Virginia Beach and Washington DC markets, Charley, a native of Washington, IN who started her career at WEND in Charlotte NC, and Matty, a native of NH, whose resume includes WHFS in Washington DC. On several occasions, the \\"Get Up! Show\\" has started to share the famous and elusive \\"Secret recipe for million dollar fudge\\" live on the air, only to have the signal mysteriously overtaken by heavy static or the transmitter shut off. The station originally focused on playing music of multiple genres, eras, and styles, from as far back as the 1960s to present. In recent times, the station has removed the majority of the newer music and focused mainly on 1970s and 1980s classic hits alongside some 1990s music. The station still includes a few songs from the early 2000s. They have been the first station locally to play brand new music from The Rolling Stones, Weezer, Sting, Kacey Musgraves and many more, adding to their reputation for unpredictability. Several slogans, such as \\"Random Rules\\" and \\"We Play Everything\\" demonstrate this dedication to a wide variety of music.

In his poetry, Delvig upheld the waning traditions of Russian Neoclassicism. He became interested in Russian folklore and wrote numerous imitations of folk songs. Some of these were put to music by the composers Alexander Alyabyev and Mikhail Glinka. As a journalist, Delvig edited the periodical Northern Flowers (1825-1831), in which Pushkin was a regular contributor. In 1830-1831, he co-edited with Pushkin the Literaturnaya Gazeta, which was banned by the Tsarist government after information laid by Thaddeus Bulgarin.

TIU was founded in 1965 with a focus on business and commerce, and upon earning accreditation from the Ministry of Education (MEXT) the college has grown into a private university that now encompasses five undergraduate schools and four graduate schools in the Greater Tokyo Area. TIU also has a sister school relationship with Willamette University, as well as an American campus adjunct to WU's campus (TIUA). TIU developed an English-based undergraduate degree providing majors in Business Economics and International Relations in 2014 called the English Track Program, and the international student body has since grown to roughly 1,200 students from over 60 countries. That one in every eight students at TIU is enrolled in the English-track degree program Times Higher Education ranked TIU as the third most international university in Japan in 2017, and ninth place in 2018. Through a university study conducted by Nikkei Career Magazine released in June 2018, TIU received high praise particularly in \\"strive for educational development\\" (1st place), \\"contribution to local economy and society\\" (2nd place), and \\"ability to motivate students to succeed\\" (3rd place). The main campus of the university is located in Kawagoe City in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, which is a part of the Greater Tokyo Area. Construction of a new international campus in Ikebukuro, downtown Tokyo, has begun. It is scheduled to open in 2022-2023.  History  The university was founded in 1965 by as . In 1986 the school was renamed . In 1989, Tokyo International University of America (TIUA), along with an American Studies Program were established in partnership with Willamette University in Oregon, USA. The one-year program at TIUA and Willamette University enables students to pursue academic goals, while developing intercultural and global awareness. In 2014, the university launched the English Track (E-Track) Program. This program focuses on providing Japanese and international students with the opportunity to earn bachelor's, master's, and doctorate's degrees in an all- English curriculum. TIU began to offer new undergraduate IT courses and a new master of science major in Digital Marketing and Business in April, 2018.

The university participated in a bidding process to adopt part of the former mint bureau site, neighboring Sunshine City, and TIU's plan successfully won the competition. This land will be passed over to the university in October 2020, and the campus facilities are set to be opened in September 2023. Artist's rendition of Tokyo International University's Global Campus in Ikebukuro, scheduled to open in 2023. The English Track Program, as well as other educational globalization functions, will be centralized in this new campus. The university is planning to relocate half of the student body. The plan also includes academics and researchers recruited from around the world, which will further enhance international \\"brain circulation\\" in line with Japan's national policy. The university's main campus is in the area surrounding Kawagoe City in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, which is a part of the Greater Tokyo Area. This new campus will be directly linked to the Kawagoe Campus via the Tobu Tojo Line as well as the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line, and it will take roughly 30 minutes to travel between campuses.  Institute for International Strategy  TIU has an affiliated think tank, the Institute for International Strategy, established to conduct interdisciplinary research on issues of strategic international importance from global and Japanese perspectives. It aims to create an international and local network of researchers and practitioners in the many fields of international affairs - politics, diplomacy and security, business and economics, and public policy. TIU professors with topnotch PhDs mainly serve as permanent research fellows with invited scholars from all over the world occasionally invited to conduct lectures or pursue cutting-edge research in their fields of specialization.

Strongly correlated materials are a wide class of heavy fermion compounds that include insulators and electronic materials, and show unusual (often technologically useful) electronic and magnetic properties, such as metal-insulator transitions, half-metallicity, and spin- charge separation. The essential feature that defines these materials is that the behavior of their electrons or spinons cannot be described effectively in terms of non-interacting entities. Theoretical models of the electronic (fermionic) structure of strongly correlated materials must include electronic (fermionic) correlation to be accurate. As of recently, the label Quantum Materials is also used to refer to Strongly Correlated Materials, among others. Transition metal oxides Many transition metal oxides belong into this class which may be subdivided according to their behavior, e.g. high-Tc, spintronic materials, multiferroics, Mott insulators, spin Peierls materials, heavy fermion materials, quasi-low-dimensional materials, etc. The single most intensively studied effect is probably high-temperature superconductivity in doped cuprates, e.g. La2‚àíxSrxCuO4. Other ordering or magnetic phenomena and temperature-induced phase transitions in many transition-metal oxides are also gathered under the term \\"strongly correlated materials.\\" Electronic structures Typically, strongly correlated materials have incompletely filled d- or f-electron shells with narrow energy bands. One can no longer consider any electron in the material as being in a \\"sea\\" of the averaged motion of the others (also known as mean field theory). Each single electron has a complex influence on its neighbors. The term strong correlation refers to behavior of electrons in solids that is not well-described (often not even in a qualitatively correct manner) by simple one-electron theories such as the local-density approximation (LDA) of density-functional theory or Hartree‚ÄìFock theory. For instance, the seemingly simple material NiO has a partially filled 3d-band (the Ni atom has 8 of 10 possible 3d-electrons) and therefore would be expected to be a good conductor. However, strong Coulomb repulsion (a correlation effect) between d-electrons makes NiO instead a wide-band gap insulator. Thus, strongly correlated materials have electronic structures that are neither simply free-electron-like nor completely ionic, but a mixture of both. Theories Extensions to the LDA (LDA+U, GGA, SIC, GW, etc.) as well as simplified models Hamiltonians (e.g. Hubbard-like models) have been proposed and developed in order to describe phenomena that are due to strong electron correlation. Among them, dynamical mean field theory successfully captures the main features of correlated materials. Schemes that use both LDA and DMFT explain many experimental results in the field of correlated electrons. Structural studies Experimentally, optical spectroscopy, high- energy electron spectroscopies, resonant photoemission, and more recently resonant inelastic (hard and soft) X-ray scattering (RIXS) and neutron spectroscopy have been used to study the electronic and magnetic structure of strongly correlated materials. Spectral signatures seen by these techniques that are not explained by one-electron density of states are often related to strong correlation effects. The experimentally obtained spectra can be compared to predictions of certain models or may be used to establish constraints to the parameter sets. One has for instance established a classification scheme of transition metal oxides within the so-called Zaanen‚ÄìSawatzky‚ÄìAllen diagram. Applications The manipulation and use of correlated phenomena has applications like superconducting magnets and in magnetic storage (CMR) technologies. Furthermore, other phenomena like the MI transition in VO2 is explored as a means to make smart windows to reduce the heating/cooling need of a room.

Its 140-seat theatre, courtyard, and stage provide the venue for a variety of events.  History In 1921, Arlington Memorial School was constructed. In 1922, students were then moved into the new Town high school. This was the first high school of the Town of Arlington, rather than the individual districts of Arlington. An 1892 legislation act of the Vermont Legislature required towns to address the means of education, rather than the districts of each town. The school was named in memorial to all of the Arlington Veterans of every war. Before Arlington Memorial school was constructed, students from each district school would have to take the train to North Bennington or Manchester in order to attend upper-level classes. = Arlington Memorial School fire = On November 9, 1940, Arlington Memorial school burned down. The town was quick to assemble and addressed the disaster in two stages. The first stage was the short term, students would meet in family homes in order to graduate on time. While the second, long-term goal, was to build a new building on top of the old one. The old building was starting to get overcrowded and the fire could be considered a blessing and a curse.

The sixth tropical storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a tropical wave on July 29 about 975 miles (1,575 km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. It moved west-northwestward, and under generally favorable conditions it strengthened to attain peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) on August 2. Fefa turned to the west towards Hawaii, and slowly weakened until dissipating near the island of Hawaii. The hurricane produced rough surf, moderate wind gusts, and locally heavy rainfall during its passage over Hawaii. No damages or deaths were reported. Two people were injured in the island of Hawaii due to lightning strikes from the storm. Meteorological history A westward-moving tropical wave exited the coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level circulation developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent to the development of a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975 miles (1,575 km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level circulation twelve hours after the depression formed. Located over warm waters with fair upper level outflow, the depression quickly intensified and attained tropical storm status twelve hours after forming. Upon strengthening into a tropical storm, Fefa developed a curved cloud band over the southern and eastern portion of the center. The storm slowly strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward, a motion due to the presence of a high-pressure ridge to its north. Fefa initially strengthened slowly; on the day after it became a tropical storm the center was located on the western edge of the deep convection. On July 31, convection began increasing over the center, and it is estimated it intensified into a hurricane later that day while located about 710 miles (1,145 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Initially, Fefa was forecast to intensify slightly after reaching hurricane status to reach peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). However, it quickly intensified after a large, ragged eye developed early on August 1. On August 2, the eye organized further, and Fefa strengthened to attain a peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) while located about 940 miles (1,510 km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Based on higher Dvorak numbers, the hurricane could have peaked with winds stronger than 120 mph (195 km/h). Fefa encountered cooler waters shortly after peaking in intensity, and subsequently began to weaken. The hurricane gradually weakened as it turned more to the west, a change in motion due to building high pressures to its north, and on August 3 the winds of Fefa dropped to 85 mph (135 km/h) due to cooler water and dry air. Tropical Storm Fefa to the east of Hawaii As Fefa turned more to the west, it paralleled the cooler waters, allowing the eye to remain distinct as the hurricane remained well-organized. Despite moving over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and becoming involved with the Stratocumulus cloud field to its north, the hurricane restrengthened on August 4 to reach a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (170 km/h) while located about 1,265 miles (2,070 km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawai'i. After maintaining 105 mph (170 km/h) winds for about 18 hours, Fefa weakened slightly due to increasing wind shear from a cold-core trough as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center area of responsibility. As the shear increased, the cyclone weakened more rapidly, and on August 6 it weakened to a tropical storm while located about 650 miles (1,060 km) east of the island of Hawaii. Initially, forecasters predicted Fefa to turn to the northwest to the north of the Hawaiian Islands. However, the storm continued moving almost due westward as it steadily weakened. Aircraft reconnaissance flew into Fefa three times as it neared Hawaii. Late on August 7, Fefa weakened to a tropical depression a short distance of the island of Hawaii, and early on August 8 the depression began dissipating and degenerated into a tropical wave after moving onshore. The remnants tracked west-northwestward and passed south of the Hawaiian Islands until dissipating on August 9 to the northwest of Kauai. Impact and retirement Image of Fefa as a hurricane. The prolonged westward track of Hurricane Fefa produced swells of up to 15 feet (4.5 m) in height. The swells hit eastward facing beaches along the island of Hawaii. The swells washed debris and sea water onto coastal roads near Punaluu Black Sand Beach, resulting in the roads being closed following the storm. Southwestern Maui experienced rough surf, as well. Despite being a weak tropical depression and a tropical wave while moving through the Hawaiian Islands, Fefa produced locally strong wind gusts of up to 50 mph (80 km/h) in the islands of Hawaii and Maui. Prior to moving across the island of Hawaii, strong thunderstorms developed in the northeastern portion of the remnant circulation of Fefa. The thunderstorms developed further as they moved over the slopes of Mauna Kea and Kohala. The thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall in areas, resulting in flash flooding in Kohala and Hamakua. Hurricane Fefa resulted in no known deaths. Lightning from the storm caused two injuries. A man in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was hurt when lightning struck where he was walking. A man in Hilo was burnt when lightning moved through telephone wires. The storm resulted in no reported damage. The name Fefa was removed after this storm and replaced with Felicia in the 1997 season. The reason for the name retirement is unknown, as the storm itself caused little damage. Possible reasons listed for the removal of the name are pronunciation ambiguity, a socially unacceptable meaning in another language, or because the storm name represented a significant human disaster.

The series was a spoof on the authoritative, academic discourse evident on such authoritative panel series as Quiz Kids and Information Please, while the beginning of the program parodied the popular quiz show, Doctor I.Q. With announcers Ken Roberts and Dick Stark, the program was broadcast on Mutual from June 25, 1942 to February 28, 1944, on CBS from February 25, 1944 to September 27, 1950 and finally on NBC from July 4, 1951 to September 26, 1951. The series typically aired as a summer replacement. Panelists The satirical series featured \\"a board of experts who are dumber than you are and can prove it.\\" Tom Howard was the quizmaster who asked questions of dim-bulb panelists Harry McNaughton, Lulu McConnell and George Shelton. The Irish-born Howard (1885-1955) and Shelton (1885-1972) had previously worked together as a team in vaudeville and comedy film shorts, while McConnell (1882-1962) and British comic McNaughton (1896-1967) had both appeared in many Broadway musical comedies and revues between 1920 and the late 1930s. Q&A; Each episode would start with some jokes (\\"Do married men live longer than single men?\\"... \\"No, it only seems longer.\\") and an introduction of the experts. After this, three or four questions would be discussed in detail: some posed by Howard, some picked at random by a guest from the audience. These questions often had the answer obvious in the query (\\"What town in Massachusetts had the Boston Tea Party?\\") or were common knowledge: * \\"Can you tell me the man's name children look for on Christmas Eve?\\" * \\"How long does it take a ship to make a five-day journey?\\" * \\"What animal does a blacksmith make horse shoes for?\\" * \\"For what meal do we wear a dinner jacket?\\" * \\"What is the habitat of the Bengal tiger?\\" Even so, the panelists would inevitably get the answer wrong, providing outrageously funny answers instead, followed by an even more uproarious rationale for their answer, a conversation that goes off on a tangent, and/or insults at each other. The show had a number of running gags which became catchphrases with listeners such as McNaughton's \\"Now we're back to Miss McConnell again\\" and Shelton's \\"I used to woik in that town.\\" Television The original radio cast brought the show to television. It was first seen on CBS from June 6 to September 19, 1949. After two years, the series returned on NBC from July 5 to September 27, 1951; by this point, Howard (who appeared in this version in an elaborate cap and gown outfit) did not acknowledge that the 1949 episodes ever happened (a surviving episode from the 1951 run implied that the show had never appeared on television before). A spoof of this version was done in the mid-1950s by Jackie Gleason. The series was revived by Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions as a weekly syndicated series from September 10, 1973 to September, 1974. In this version, host Joe Flynn queried panelists Jo Anne Worley, Billy Baxter and Charles Nelson Reilly (Worley and Reilly appeared concurrently as semi-regulars on the TV show Match Game; Reilly became a regular panelist on that show by the time It Pays to Be Ignorant ended this run). Not long after this version discontinued production, Flynn died from drowning in his swimming pool. Episode status At least 69 radio episodes are known to exist. These include those listed below and three held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. One 1951 television episode and two syndicated TV episodes are known to exist; the latter two are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

Its publication started in early 2004 as a monthly series at Image Comics, completing its first five-issues story-arc. After a creative team change and a creative difference with the publisher, the title moved to Speakeasy Comics where its first arc was collected in 2005 as a trade paperback. Synopsis Newspaper reporter Jack Baxter can turn invisible. Not exactly a hero, Baxter uses his powers to scoop other reporters. His test of fire comes when his brother is captured in Iraq. Jack rescues his brother with the aid of the beautiful Madison Blue, an invisible secret agent for the group 'Miscellaneous'. Stories lean toward realistic portrayals of characters in modern world, not typical super-hero fare. The series ran in 2005 from Image and returned in November, 2007, from Atomic Pop Art Entertainment with ABSOLUTE PHANTOM JACK, which collects all the previous Image comics and about 80 pages of new stories. The all-new, 110-page graphic novel PHANTOM JACK: THE NOWHERE MAN AGENDA, where Jack confronts his evil opposite and faces his final fate, will be published as soon as a new publisher is found.

She was married to English singer David Bowie (whom she assisted in conceptualizing the costumes for the Ziggy Stardust stage show)) from 1970 until their divorce in 1980. The couple had one child, film director Duncan Jones.  Early life and education  Angie Bowie was born as Mary Angela Barnett, an American citizen, on September 25, 1949, in Cyprus to Col. George M. Barnett, a United States Army veteran,Bowie, p. 29 and his wife, Helena Maria Galas Barnett, a naturalized Canadian. Her father was a mining engineer and ran a mill for Cyprus Mines Corporation. She has one brother, who is 16 years older than herself. Both her parents died in 1984.Angela Bowie, Backstage Passes, p. 30 She is of English and Polish descent,Angela Bowie \\"Backstage Passes\\", pp. 29‚Äì30 and she was brought up as a Roman Catholic. However, she has identified as a Cypriot, writing in 2000, \\"I am a Cypriot by disposition. I don't have a passport or Cypriot nationality but my heart is Cypriot, not Greek or Turkish Cypriot, just Cypriot.\\" Educated in Cyprus, Switzerland, and the UK (Kingston Polytechnic), she briefly attended Connecticut College until she was expelled after an affair with someone of the same sex, an event mentioned in her 1981 autobiography, Free Spirit.Bowie, p. 30  Career  = Film and television = During the 1970s, Angie Bowie occasionally appeared as a guest on television talk shows. She appeared on The Tonight Show, hosted by Johnny Carson on November 16, 1973.Bowie, pp. 168‚Äì73 She also performed on The Mike Douglas Show in early 1975.Bowie, pp. 247‚Äì49 She auditioned for the leading role in what dates show to have been the ABC-TV television film Wonder Woman which aired on March 12, 1974, and starred Cathy Lee Crosby (not as often reported for the later television series Wonder Woman, in which the title role was played by Lynda Carter).Bowie, pp. 168‚Äì70 Newsweek hypothesised in their February 11, 1974, issue that she lost the part because of her refusal to wear a bra. Later in 1975, Bowie bought the television rights to Marvel Comics' characters Black Widow and Daredevil, hoping to develop and sell a series featuring the two heroes. She planned to play Black Widow, with actor Ben Carruthers as Daredevil. The series failed to secure a studio deal and it never went beyond the development stage.Gwynne Watkins, \\"The Black Widow Movie That Almost Happened\\", Yahoo! Movies, September 25, 2014. In March 1982, Bowie appeared on the television program The Old Grey Whistle Test, reciting poetry, while Mick Karn, from the band Japan, played bass. Her performance was lambasted by the British media. Bowie appeared as herself in the D.A. Pennebaker concert film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1973) and Glitter Goddess of Sunset Strip (1991). She also has had credited acting roles in at least four films: Eat the Rich (1987, as Henry's wife), Demented (1994), Deadrockstar (2002, as Bartender) and La Funcionaria Asesina (The Slayer Bureaucrat, 2009, as Helen Price/Constance). On January 5, 2016, Bowie appeared on the seventeenth series of Celebrity Big Brother. On January 10, she was informed off screen of the death of her former husband David Bowie.

Personal life  = Relationships = She met musician David Bowie in London in 1969, at the age of 19. According to her, they met through their mutual friendship with record executive Calvin Mark Lee.Bowie, pp. 5‚Äì7 The couple married one year later, on March 19, 1970, at Bromley Register Office in Beckenham Lane, Kent. They had an open marriage. She stated that they were not in love and the union was a marriage of convenience. She told the Evening Standard, \\"We got married so that I could work [to get a permit]. I didn't think it would last and David said, before we got married, 'I'm not really in love with you' and I thought that's probably a good thing.\\" Their son Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones was born on May 30, 1971. He later preferred to be known as Joe or Joey, but has since reverted to the name Duncan Jones. After nine years of marriage, Angie and David Bowie separated, and they divorced on February 8, 1980, in Switzerland. In the divorce settlement she received ¬£500,000 paid in instalments and a ten-year gagging clause. Not wanting to fight over custody, she left their son with David. She stated that David's drug habit had become so out of control that she believed giving him the responsibility of raising their son would stabilise him. During her marriage, she often accompanied her husband on his international concert tours. He wrote the song \\"The Prettiest Star\\", about her. (During a backstage sequence in the concert film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, David calls Angie by the name \\"Star\\"). After the divorce, Bowie said she was blackballed from the entertainment industry and was so depressed that she considered suicide. Following her divorce, Angela Barnett had a long-term relationship with punk musician Drew Blood (born Andrew Lipka); they had a daughter, Stacia Larranna Celeste Lipka (also referred to as Stasha). She later lived in Tucson, Arizona.Emine Saner, \\"Why I Gave Up My Son Zowie\\", London Evening Standard, March 17, 2006. Since 1993, she has been in a relationship with Michael Gassett, an electrical engineer nearly 20 years her junior. They live in Acworth, Georgia. = Estrangement from Duncan Jones = Bowie is estranged from her son Duncan Jones, saying in a 2010 interview that a reconciliation was unlikely. She also mentioned the estrangement during her 2016 appearance on Celebrity Big Brother. She previously said that although she has not seen her son since he was 13, he had been in very brief contact with her daughter Stasha in the early 2000s. \\"He emailed me and I didn't know what to say. So I put them together. They corresponded for a bit and then that stopped. He is cold, like his father. David cut me off. Zowie, or Duncan, cut me and Stasha off,\\" she said. When asked by The Times in 2017 whether she had been in touch with her son since David Bowie's death the year before, she responded, \\"My son? No, why should I be? I'm not interested. It stopped when my father changed his will to not include an educational trust fund for Zowie because David divorced me. When my father did that I followed precedent. It's over. Nothing. Nothing to do with me.\\" In a 2018 interview for Marc Maron's WTF podcast, Jones reiterated that they had never reconciled saying she was a \\"corrosive person.\\" =Rolling Stones song \\"Angie\\"= Angie Bowie has long claimed to have inspired The Rolling Stones' hit song \\"Angie\\" from their 1973 album Goats Head Soup. However, the songwriters Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have consistently denied this. In 1993, in the liner notes to the Rolling Stones' compilation album Jump Back: The Best of The Rolling Stones, Richards said that the title was inspired by his newborn daughter, Dandelion Angela. Later, in his 2010 memoir Life, he said that he had chosen the name at random when writing the song and that \\"[i]t was not about any particular person.\\" According to NME, the lyrics of the song were inspired by Jagger's breakup with Marianne Faithfull.  Fictional portrayals  The fictional character of Mandy, portrayed by Toni Collette in the film Velvet Goldmine, was based upon Bowie.Richard Harrington, \\"Gone Glam Digging; \`Velvet Goldmine' Unearths '70s Tale\\", The Washington Post, November 6, 1998 Joshua Clover. \\"Fables of the Self-Construction\\", Spin, November 1998, pp. 94ff.

It includes the classes Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa, Staurozoa and Cubozoa, and possibly the parasitic Polypodiozoa. Medusozoans are distinguished by having a medusa stage in their often complex life cycle, a medusa typically being an umbrella-shaped body with stinging tentacles around the edge. With the exception of some Hydrozoa (and Polypodiozoa), all are called jellyfish in their free-swimming medusa phase. Taxonomy The phylum Cnidaria is widely accepted as being monophyletic and consisting of two clades, Anthozoa and Medusozoa. Anthozoa includes the classes Hexacorallia, the hard corals, and Octocorallia, the soft corals, as well as Ceriantharia, the tube-dwelling anemones. There is strong support for this group having been the first to branch off from the ancestral line. Medusozoa includes the classes Staurozoa, Cubozoa, Scyphozoa and Hydrozoa, but the relationships between these are unclear. Analysis using ribosomal RNA subunits suggests that within Medusozoa, Staurozoa was the first group to diverge, with Cubozoa and Scyphozoa forming a clade, a sister group to Hydrozoa. Further study involving the order of mitochondrial genes supports this view, and their possession of linear mitochondrial genomes is striking evidence of the monophyly of medusozoans. The affinities of the class Polypodiozoa, containing the single species Polypodium hydriforme, have long been unclear. This species is an endoparasite of fish eggs and has a peculiar life cycle. It has traditionally been considered to be a cnidarian because of its possession of nematocysts, but molecular studies using 18S rDNA sequences have placed it closer to Myxozoa. Further studies involving 28S rDNA sequences suggest that it is either part of the hydrozoan clade Leptothecata, or a sister taxon to Hydrozoa, and does not group with myxozoans. Characteristics Pelagia noctiluca, a scyphozoan An unidentified cubozoan Haliclystus octoradiatus, a staurozoan A colonial hydrozoan Medusozoans differ from anthozoans in having a medusa stage in their life cycle. The basic pattern is medusa (usually the adult or sexual phase), planula larva, polyp, medusa. Symmetry is tetramerous, with parts in fours or multiples of four. The mitochondrial DNA molecules are linear rather than circular as in anthozoans and almost all other animals. The cnidae, the explosive cells characteristic of the Cnidaria and used in prey capture and defence, are of a single type, there being nematocysts but no spirocysts or ptychocysts. In contrast, the anthozoan life cycle involves a planula larva which settles and becomes a sessile polyp, which is the adult or sexual phase. Diversity There is considerable divergence from the basic life cycle pattern among medusozoans. Scyphozoa is the group commonly known as \\"true jellyfish\\" and occur in tropical, temperate and polar seas worldwide. Scyphozoans generally have planula larvae that develop into sessile polyps. These reproduce asexually, producing similar polyps by budding, and then either transform into medusae, or repeatedly bud medusae from their upper surface in a process known as strobilation. Cubozoa is a group commonly known as box jellyfish, that occur in tropical and warm temperate seas. They have cube-shaped, transparent medusae and are heavily-armed with venomous nematocysts. Cubozoans have planula larvae, which settle and develop into sessile polyps, which subsequently metamorphose into sexual medusae, the oral end of each polyp changing into a medusa which separates and swims away. Staurozoa is a small group commonly known as stalked jellyfish. The animals remain attached to the substrate by a stalk at the opposite end from the mouth. Staurozoans can be regarded as large polyps that have partially differentiated into sexually mature medusae. These spawn gametes which develop into non-swimming planulae that crawl away to new locations. Hydrozoa is a large group of solitary and colonial cnidarians from both marine and freshwater environments worldwide. Hydrozoans exhibit the greatest variety of life cycles among medusozoans, with either the polyp or the medusa stage being missing in some groups. In general, medusae are budded laterally from polyps, become mature and spawn, releasing gametes into the water. The planulae may settle to become polyps or continue living in the water column as medusae.

His father was a Polish Member of Parliament from 1922 to 1928. Both his parents died in Soviet Gulag camps. Trained as a pilot at Polish Air Force Academy in Dƒôblin, he did not fight in Poland in 1939, but was evacuated westwards, escaped to Romania, then to France and on 27 June 1940 arrived in England. During the Battle of Britain, he served with 55 OTU in Aston Down. In May 1941, he joined No. 245 Squadron. In July 1941, he was transferred to No. 303 Squadron, based at Northolt. On 6 November 1941, Bie≈Ñkowski claimed a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter shot down. On 12 April 1942, his aircraft was shot up by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, and he had to force land with collapsed landing gear near the English coast.Biography at the Polish Air Force website He served from 1 December 1942 until 4 July 1943 as Squadron Leader of No. 303 Squadron. At that time he was also flying with 315 (Polish) Squadron and on 13 May 1943 was involved in combat with enemy fighters between 11.30 and 13.05. After that, his Spitfire Mk.IX BS242 disappeared from the list and on 6 June 1943, after repairs, was delivered to 303 Squadron. During July 1943, No. 303 Squadron were stationed at RAF Kirton-in-Lindsey, where the newly arrived US Army Air Corps 94th Fighter Squadron had just been assigned. He befriended some of the American pilots, who gave him the affectionate nickname \\"Bing Crosby\\", a play on his family name. From January 1945 to 24 February 1945, he commanded 302. On 24 February, his Spitfire Mk. XVI (TB341, \\"WX-B\\") was shot down by flak over Germany near Wesel and he was taken prisoner. Released by American forces, by the end of the war he was a wing commander. During the war, he flew 74 sorties, claiming one Bf 109 destroyed and a Fw 190 damaged. He died on 15 August 1979 in London aged 66. He was buried in Gunnersbury Cemetery in West London. His brother Jan Bie≈Ñkowski, was also a pilot; he was shot down over Cherbourg in 1944.

The school serves students in grades 7-12. The school enrolls approximately 600 students per year, with 400 students in the high school and 200 attending middle school. The school is a combined middle and high school, since the town does not have the needed population of adolescents to include a separate middle school. Class sizes are around 100 students, while some classes, such as the Class of 1978, have enrolled up to 160 students at one time. The Class of 2010 is one of the smallest Aitkin High School classes in history, with a class size at graduation of 83. The class entered with 98 students in 2004. The school is a member of Minnesota's Independent School District 1 (Aitkin School District), and is affiliated with the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL). The school is a member of the Mid-State Conference. The AHS mascot is the Gobbler. History Aitkin High School was established in the year 1894 and the oldest school building was completed in 1901. Many additions have been added to the school since. When the school was first built, many children that lived outside the city of Aitkin attended local country schools, and then attended AHS after they graduated from 8th grade. At that time, Aitkin High School served grades 9‚Äì12 only. In 1928, an addition to the school was built and it became a 7‚Äì12 school, even though many students were in country, primary and parochial schools (particularly Catholic) until 8th grade. Several modifications took place during the following decades, including a new cafeteria, band area, and auditorium. The old gym and auditorium was created in a 1941 project and the west wing was added in the 1950s. The most major change after 1928 took place in 1976, when the school was remodeled and the old school building was demolished. The west wing still remains. Not many major modifications took place after that until the year 2000, when a new band area was established. The 1941 auditorium was remodeled in 1994 while keeping most of the classic features. In 2005, a new weight room was built. The school was modified once again in 2006 with a newly added commons area, in the 9th grade locker area, and a new 7th grade locker area built on the second floor of the school, along with an LED sign in the front of the building. In 2007, a more advanced security system was installed and a speed limit regulation was implemented around the school. In 2008, a wall was removed in the cafeteria which will enable more students to have lunch in one lunch period, and signs were posted on all entrances of the school. Paintings by students were placed on the walls to give it a more friendly atmosphere. A new student parking lot was added to the school in 2009. Pavement was planned to take place in Summer 2010 but never occurred. In circa late 2014 to early 2015, plans for remodeling the high school were considered once again. Some of the plans include an expansion of the new gym area and an addition for collaborative learning/special education program, along with a few other minor updates and modifications. The plans were voted down in a county wide election on January 6, 2015, although alternative plans are still being contemplated. Some plans include minor remodeling projects along with the possibility to building a brand new school. In July 2015, reports of 1.75 inches of rain fell early Sunday morning, July 12, in Aitkin and nearly three more inches fell during the evening during an outbreak of severe thunderstorms that brought widespread damage throughout Central Minnesota, which includes the Brainerd Lakes Area and the Aitkin area. According to Aitkin Superintendent Bernie Novak and head of maintenance, Jim Bright, the weight of the water on the high school roof caused a rubber membrane around a drain to tear, creating an 18-inch by 6 foot hole around a roof drain. Large amounts of water on the roof gushed through the hole into the building and through the ceilings on each of the three levels of classrooms. One-half to three-fourths of the ceiling tile were drenched with water and at one point there was as much as two inches of water on the first floor hallway. The media center along with new Macintosh computers was damaged; the first floor server room, a special education room and the third floor chemistry lab also received extensive damage. Repairs are currently taking place and despite the damages, school will start as normally scheduled. Throughout the 2015-2016 school year, a few modifications were taken place throughout the high school and the athletic fields. On September 11, 2015, the Aitkin football field was named \\"Veterans Field\\" in honor of local veterans with a dedication ceremony proceeding the football game.Steffanie Sanford. \\"Veterans Field dedicated\\".

Debate is still taking place about the future of the high school, such as whether to continue modifications, build a new school, or leave the school as it is. On August 9, 2016, the public has voted against the referendum in a landslide. Starting in the 2016-2017 school years, with a grant from Apple, the school provided MacBook computers for each of the students to assist them with assignments, research, and communications.Pakarinen, K. \\"New teachers, new technology at AHS\\".

School In Fall 2009, AHS had 900 students. The Aitkin School District's was Superintendent is Brad Kelvington. Currently, the school district has an interim superintendent as the search for a new superintendent takes place. The interim Superintendent is Charles Rick. The high school principal is Paul Karelis, a 1980 graduate of Aitkin High School. Chad Pederson is the Assistant Principal and the Athletic Director is Jason Cline. Curriculum and scheduling Aitkin High School is on an 8-period quarter/semester schedule. Each semester lasts 9 weeks. Class periods are currently 46‚Äì52 minutes in length with 4 minutes passing time in between classes. Some classes, such as the ones in the Industrial Arts area are 2 periods in length. Additionally, middle school and high school students share the same time schedule. From the years 1998‚Äì2007, the school used a block schedule, where classes were 84 minutes long while middle school classes were 42‚Äì48 minutes in length with 4 minute passing time. High School students were allowed up to 7 minutes passing times. In 2007, the trimester schedule used at AHS during the 1960s and 1970s was reinstated. Independent study periods were added on a rotation basis. (e.g. Day 1 is 1st hour, Day 2 is second hour, etc.) Independent study periods enable students to have time to finish class assignments, get help from another teacher, attend meetings and school assemblies, and much more. In recent years, the rotation basis has changed to a daily class period at the end of each day during Period 8. In 2010, a new student database, Infinite Campus, was integrated, which is a similar format to Blackboard and related programs, to enable students, teachers, and parents to keep track of their students performance in school. The online learning tool has many feature such as the ability to register for classes online, check grades and find missing assignments. More than 110 classes are offered.Bot generated title --> This includes subjects in agriculture, business, media arts, computer science and information technology, English, family and consumer science, art, music, physical education, industrial technology, mathematics, science, social studies, and World Languages. Although AHS does not offer any AP or IB classes, it offers college credit for advanced classes with a program called College in the Schools through the University of Minnesota, Central Lakes Community College, Mesabi Community College, and Vermilion Community College and the option of PSEO. These enable students to receive college credits at select colleges free of tuition and book and may even obtain enough credits to get an Associate of Arts Degree. Facilities The school features a newly added commons area, two gyms, a band area, an auditorium, a Strength room, a choir area, and three floors of classrooms and laboratory type classroom for industrial arts, home economics, fine arts, and agriculture.

The Aitkin All Starz had been known to go to state annually for more than a decade and the momentum still continues. The last time the Aitkin wrestling team went to State as a whole was in the year 2008. Aitkin High School had a great stretch of athletic ability in the 1950s, while the football, wrestling, and track team made many outstanding achievements. A lag in athletic ability took place for most of the 1960s and the 1970s with an exception for baseball and softball. The baseball team made the conference championship both in 1977 and 1978, and made it to the sections in 1977, but never made it to state throughout the decade. 1982 was a magical year for sport in Aitkin High School, which included the momentous boys' basketball state tournament in 1982 along with the progressing to state with the football team that fall. During the 1990s and 2000s, under the leadership of Dr. Edward Anderson as the Superintendent, Aitkin's athletic ability with an exception for the wrestling and the newly formed All Starz dance team has declined and its performance has shifted to mainly more artistic and academic achievements. The school has gradually transitioned into more athletic competence in the later end of the 2000s, starting when Bernie Novak has become the Superintendent in 2005, and many changes were added to the school to improve athletic competence and school spirit. In 2005, a weight room facility was constructed with the addition of newer weight room equipment in circa 2007‚Äì2008. A new scoreboard was added in 2009 in the new gym. The weight room received several upgrades in the mid 2010s as many sports refocused their efforts in the weight room. The weight room is host to a summer strength and agility program and an annual lift-a-thon, with the benefits of the lift-a-thon being donated to veterans in need.

It was designed by the architect Albert Edward Lambert, who also designed the rebuild of the Nottingham Midland station (now known simply as Nottingham Station). It was opened by the Nottingham Joint Station Committee on 24 May 1900 and closed on 4 September 1967 by the London Midland Region of British Railways. The station building was entirely demolished (except the clock tower), and the Victoria Centre shopping centre was built on the site, incorporating the old station clock tower into the main entrance on Milton Street (the continuation of Mansfield Road). Background In 1893 the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway obtained authorisation to extend its North Midlands railway network into London. This new line was opened on 15 March 1899 (by which time the railway company was known as the Great Central Railway) and became known as the London Extension, stretching from Annesley to a new station at Marylebone in London. The line passed through Nottingham, where a new station was to be built. Construction and opening Station interior in the years after opening. The station's construction was on a grand scale: a site was acquired at a cost of ¬£473,000 (¬£) in the heart of Nottingham's city centre; negotiations for the land acquisition had taken three years. The construction called for the demolition of whole streets of some 1,300 houses, 24 public houses, and St. Stephen's Church, Bunker's Hill, following which about of sandstone was excavated from the site. The site measured about in length from north to south and had an average width of , with a tunnel at each end for access. The Great Central Railway and Great Northern Railway shared the station (they split into two lines at Weekday Cross junction). The two owners failed to reach agreement on the station's name; the Great Central naturally wanted it called \\"Central\\", a proposition the Great Northern, still smarting from the incursion into its territory made by the London Extension, would not accept. The two railway companies operated separate booking offices, the Great Central issuing tickets reading \\"Nottingham Central\\", whilst the Great Northern's window bore the name \\"Nottingham Joint St'n\\". In the 1898 Royal Atlas of England, the station was recorded as the \\"Grt Central & Grt Northern Joint Central Station\\".John Bartholomew, The Royal Atlas of England, 1898 The town clerk resolved the situation by suggesting the name \\"Nottingham Victoria\\" to reflect the fact that the planned opening date coincided with Queen Victoria's birthday; this was readily accepted at a meeting of the Nottingham Joint Station Committee on 12 June. Nottingham Victoria station was officially opened without ceremony in the early hours of 24 May 1900, over a year after the commencement of services on the new railway line. The first service to call at the station was a Great Central express from Manchester to Marylebone, which pulled in at 1:12 a.m.; it was followed fifteen minutes later by a Great Central express travelling in the opposite direction. Station building Hilton hotel. The main station building was in true Victorian splendour. It was constructed in a Renaissance style using the best- quality red-faced bricks and Darley Dale stone, with space at the front for Hackney carriages, which was covered by a canopy. It faced onto the confluence of Mansfield Road and Milton Street for some . The three-storey building was dominated by a clock tower topped with a cupola and weather vane. At the north end of the building, access could be gained to the parcels office via two large metal gates. Once inside the building on the ground floor level, one reached the large and lofty booking hall. It was over long and wide, and contained the best-quality pine and a hard-wearing oak floor, along with a gallery on each side to gain access to spacious offices on the first floor. The booking hall contained seven ticket-issuing windows, three each for the Great Central and Great Northern and one for excursion traffic; a clock-type train indicator served all platforms. An iron overbridge led from the booking hall and spanned the platforms, to which it was connected by four broad staircases. A small footbridge at the end provided access to the island platforms at the south end, themselves connected to a side exit leading onto Parliament Street. The station in 1959 The station itself comprised two large island platforms, each between and long, with two bays at each end for local traffic, giving a total of 12 platform faces. On each island platform were dining and tea rooms together with kitchens, sleeping facilities for staff, waiting rooms, and lavatories. All these buildings were, like the rest of the station, lined with glazed tiles, which were generally buff in colour and embellished with a chocolate dado. Large steel pillars held up an enormous three-part glazed canopy measuring in length, with a centre span of and a pair of flanking spans each of . There were additional glass roofs over the double- bay platforms, each carried on central pillars. An electrically lit subway system, below track level and covering the breadth of the station, could be used for transporting luggage, thereby avoiding the need to carry it over the footbridges. The subway was linked to the main station by four lifts serving respectively the booking hall, cloakroom, and two island platforms. The refreshment rooms had their own underground subway and lifts. LMS 'Jubilee' 6P 4-6-0 No. 45638 'Zanzibar' in 1962 The station had passing loops round all platforms (for freight), two signal boxes, and two turntables. The two signal boxes were positioned at the north and south ends of the station and controlled entry and exit to the tunnels that allowed entry to the complex.

Services The traffic that passed through was varied. It included London‚ÄìManchester expresses, local services, cross-country services (e.g. from York to Bristol via Oxford) as well as freight workings. As the station was shared with the Great Northern Railway (already well established when Victoria opened), a large network of lines serving many destinations was available from the one station. The new services offered unbeatable competition to the Midland Railway services from Nottingham railway station. The Midland offered more trains per day to Leicester, but the journey time of 40 minutes was outclassed by the Great Central's journey time of 27 minutes non-stop. The journey time to Sheffield was similarly impressive at 50 minutes. In 1905, there were nine goods trains to London each day, the fastest taking only 2 hours 15 minutes. Decline Down freight and Up express in 1962 During the 1960s, the whole Great Central route was run down by diverting services away from it, cutting others, and slowing down expresses to very slack timetables. Locomotives and rolling stock were old and unreliable, and the line did not benefit from British Rail's new diesel locomotives. As passenger numbers fell, going either by car or by other lines, closure seemed inevitable. The last through service from Nottingham to London ran on 3 September 1966. All that was left was a DMU service between Nottingham and Rugby, the Nottingham Victoria to Grantham services having been re-routed to Nottingham Midland on 3 July 1967. Victoria station was finally closed on 4 September 1967 and demolished (amidst much opposition), leaving only the clocktower to survive amongst the new Victoria Shopping Centre and flats. Goods trains continued to pass through the site of Victoria until May 1968, with two running lines left in place amidst the demolition of the main station. Present day The station site in 2012. The clock tower is all that remains of Nottingham Victoria station, surrounded by the 1967 Victoria shopping centre. The site is now occupied by the Victoria Shopping Centre and housing in the form of Victoria Flats, Nottingham's tallest building (256 feet / 72m tall). The new structure incorporates the original station's clock tower. From the bottom level of the shopping centre's car park, in the former station's deep cutting, the entrance of Mansfield Road railway tunnel remains visible. Upon the closure of the Great Central railway and the Great Northern/London and North Western Joint line to Melton Mowbray (via ), Nottingham also lost smaller stations: Nottingham London Road High Level and Nottingham London Road Low Level. Nottingham's other mainline station, Nottingham Midland, remains in service. Current redevelopment plans for the Victoria Shopping Centre will see an extension built northwards, filling in the last section of the former station's deep cutting and concealing the entrance to the Mansfield Road Tunnel.

CSIRO Publishing, (2014), pp. 98-99. and up to 75-80 mm, and can weigh up to 30-35 grams. The pronotum is a prominent plate-like structure that covers all or part of the thorax of insects,Pronotum. (2020). Retrieved 18 April 2020, from https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/pronotum and for the giant burrowing cockroach, it can exceed 15 mm. Their pronotum assists with digging, acting as a shovel. Its abdomen rests on the ground.Day, M. (1949). THE HISTOLOGY OF A VERY LARGE INSECT, MACROPANESTHIA RHINOCERUS SAUSS. (BLATTIDAE). Retrieved from https://www.publish.csiro.au/bi/pdf/BI9500061 The cockroach also has tubercles, which are small or rounded projections especially on a bone or surface. The cockroach use their tibiae, a bone in their leg, in order to dig and burrow into the ground. Their front legs have spines that appear ‚Äúmole-like‚Äù, which rest alongside the tibia when not in use. As a member of the Blaberidae, the giant burrowing cockroach is well adapted for burrowing and digging with large back legs and a strong body armour, which offers protection from predators. The Giant Burrowing Cockroach is one of few Australian cockroaches without wings, which results in a lack of mobility.Brown, W.V; Rose, H.A; Lacey, M.J; Wright, K (2000). \\"The cuticular hydrocarbons of the giant soil-burrowing cockroach Macropanesthia rhinoceros Saussure (Blattodea: Blaberidae: Geoscapheinae): analysis with respect to age, sex and location\\".

Adult males and females can be differentiated by the size of the \\"scoop\\" on the pronotum, which covers the head; with the male having a much more pronounced scoop. They grow by shedding their outer shells 12 or 13 times before reaching full size. When a cockroach moults, it will appear pure white except for the eyes.Sydney Institute of TAFE. Husbandry Manual For Giant Burrowing Cockroach. (2006), pp. 6-24. Accessed 17 Mar 2020. The Giant Burrowing Cockroach species have lifespans up to ten years. Adult male cockroaches are more common than female cockroaches.Rugg, D., Rose, H., & Rugg, D. (1991). Biology of Macropanesthia rhinoceros Saussure (Dictyoptera: Blaberidae). Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 84(6), 575‚Äì582. https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/84.6.575 The young of the giant burrowing cockroaches are referred to as nymphs. The nymphs are born a creamy white colour when born, but soon develop a reddish brown colour. Both adult female and male cockroaches are dark brown. Male cockroaches have their head hidden by the pronotum with antennae on either side of their face. Adult male cockroaches have a concave pronotum which allows identification of gender. Female cockroach pronotums are not excavated. Nymphs remain with their mothers for five to seven months. The female provides food and cares for them. The mother and young share the same food supply. Distribution and habitat 200x200pxThe giant burrowing cockroach species are mostly found in Queensland, Australia. It is commonly found along the coastal stretch between Rockhampton and Cooktown. The cockroach can also be located on the islands of the Whitsundays. The species build burrows that can stretch up to one metre underground, which is where it stores food and lives permanently. Burrow depth appears to change depending on soil type, with burrows ranging from approximately 10 cm underground to 100 cm. It is prevalent in dry Eucalyptus woodlands in the northeastern territory within Australia. There are 18 known geographical populations of the cockroach along subtropical Queensland. The cockroach has a wide geographical distribution in relation to other burrowing cockroach species.Roth, L. M. (1977). A taxonomic revision of the Panesthiinae of the world I: The Panesthiinae of Australia (Dictyoptera: Blattodea: Blaberidae). Australian Journal of Zoology (Supplementary Series No.) 48, 1‚Äì112.Walker, J. A., Rugg, D. and Rose, H. A. (1994). Nine new species of Geoscapheinae (Blattodea: Blaberidae) from Australia. Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 35, 263‚Äì284. It is present across a one thousand kilometre range. The cockroach can be found in both dry and wet areas of Australia. Common dry areas it inhabits include Maiden Springs, Boonderoo and Alpha. Common wet areas the cockroach is found in include Cooktown, Magnetic island and the Whitsundays. Locations that are in the mid- range between dry and wet regions where the cockroach is present include Coen, Rochford Scrub and Mount Garnet. Populations of the cockroach can be geographically isolated due to unsuitable ground soil or by water. The species tends to prefer the drier savanna areas west of the Great Dividing Range. The most common vegetation where the cockroach is found is Eucalyptus woodland and grass. Behaviour The cockroach stays underground as it lives permanently in its burrows. The cockroach often surfaces during wet weather, with most activity coinciding with summer rains. During the dry season it remains in its burrows and feed on collected litter. It feeds mostly on dry, decomposing eucalyptus leaves. The cockroach composts the leaves in the burrow with some bark and dry grass. Burrows are often composed of grass, tree root and leaves. The entrance to the cockroach burrows resembles a flattened semi-circle. Burrows can be identifiable when the cockroach has been active, yet are often covered by litter or collapsed. The size of the burrow entrance is approximately five centimetres wide and two centimetres high. Burrows often follow a path just below the soil surface for up to one metre, and occasionally descend downwards sharply. The burrows do not follow a pattern. The cockroaches occupy the end of the burrows, which is widened up to one metre wide to contain the collected litter. Other species of insects have been located within the burrows, including scarabs, aleculid beetles, silverfish, larvae of tenebrionids and caesmaking moths, as well as other species of cockroaches. = Social behaviour = The cockroach is generally solitary, yet young nymphs remain with mothers for several months after birth. The cockroach is active after sunrise, and may begin to burrow and dig. Males wander outside of burrows more than females do. Males tend to wander in search of a mate, whilst females collect litter to take back into their burrows. Foraging is common with grown female cockroaches, and the cockroach can wander up to 50 cm from the entrance of the burrow to collect ground litter. It collects mostly dead leaves and use the mandibles to drag the litter back into their burrow. Fighting is common amongst adult males, yet adult females with nymphs are also highly aggressive. Aggressiveness is associated with its solitary existence. Aggressive behaviour can include butting, barging and hissing which often results in a cockroach being knocked over. Males can fight at the entrances to burrows in order to prevent the other male cockroaches from entering the burrow. Whilst fighting, males use the front of the pronotum to force the intruder away. A hissing sound is produced when the giant burrowing cockroach fights another. = Sounds = The cockroach can emit a hissing sound during both reproduction and when threatened. The hissing sound is produced by the expulsion of air from the cockroach‚Äôs spiracles, which is an external respiratory opening on the abdomen.Heathcote, Angela. \\"Australia‚Äôs Giant Burrowing Cockroaches Actually Hiss\\". Australian Geographic, (2020), https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2018/05/australias- giant-burrowing-cockroaches-actually-hiss/.  Biology  = Reproduction = Reproductive behaviour between the cockroaches tends to occur at night time, and is based mostly on scent, taste and touch. The male cockroaches attempt to court the females with motions such as hissing, changing posture, motioning with antennas, grooming the female, and pushing the female with their body in an attempt to lift the female. It is unknown if female cockroaches engage in multiple matings and if so, if it occurs with different male cockroaches. Females can annually have up to thirty young at once. The species is ovoviviparous meaning it has young by means of eggs which hatch internally in the parent. Unlike most insects, which lay eggs, the female Giant burrowing cockroach gives birth to her young, and protects her offspring in her underground alcove, providing them with leaf litter she gathers overnight. The cockroaches can live for up to 10 years. The species is often found with the mothers with the young together within the burrows, whereas the males are mostly absent from the burrows. The parenting cycle of the giant burrowing cockroach can last up to 6 months, or until nymphs are capable to leave and construct their own burrows and fend for themselves. One brood of approximately thirty nymphs is produced each year, and tends to be in late spring after an incubation period of approximately three months. The cockroaches shed their outer skin approximately fourteen times in their life cycle. This skin is often ingested as it is nutritious. Young nymphs are rarely found above ground, outside of the burrow. Nymphs grow at the same rate and once the nymphs leave the nest they live alone until it fully develops and becomes an adult.Tadao, M. (1992). Familial Association, Nymphal Development and Population Density in the Australian Giant Burrowing Cockroach, Macropanesthia rhinoceros (Blattaria: Blaberidae). Zoological Science., 9, 835-842. doi: https://biostor.org/reference/207751 = Obesity = Depending on the temperature, they perform different patterns of eating, carbon dioxide production, and metabolic rates. Macropanesthia rhinoceros can be diagnosed with obesity when there are no changes in its husbandry. When an individual lacks nutrition, they are susceptible to adopting a \\"thrifty phenotype\\", which prioritises fat storage over reproductive development to be able to handle dangerous environment conditions. In optimal environmental conditions, this thrifty phenotype has the potential to become maladaptive, thus causing excessive fat storage and metabolic disease. In the future, this may result in obesity or metabolic disease. Obesity can cause, \\"an atypical body conformation with narrow, elongated abdominal profiles compared to the wide, flat bodies of neighbouring conspecifics.\\" In addition, this exposes a mushy and pale tissue between their abdominal sclerites. Relationship with humans = As pets = The cockroach is calm and easy to care for making it a common and popular pet. The species cannot move fast or fly. Its large size, sedentary behavioural lifestyle and limited husbandry needs contribute to the increase in popularity for the species as a pet both in Australia and internationally. They are clean, disease free, odourless, do not bite when handled and do not climb or fly. Males can be aggressive towards other males meaning that a larger enclosure would be needed to house more than one cockroach at a time to avoid conflict. There should be more females than males in one enclosure as otherwise conflict may ensue between the males over the females. Enclosures should not be kept in direct sunlight for extended periods of time. The tank or terrarium should have clean, fine to medium grain river sand, with some being wet and the other end of the enclosure dry. The cockroach requires substrate to be up to 100mm deep, which the cockroach use with leaves and sticks to nest and burrow. The substrate is changed regularly after a few months, taking into account the size of the tank and the number of cockroaches present. The giant burrowing cockroach has lived to a maximum of eight years in captivity. Nymphs grow faster when in the wild in comparison to in captivity. Wild nymphs can reach the eighth instar in five months, yet there can be a large variation in growth rates with some nymphs taking up to a year to grow to the ninth instar. It has nine instar stages. Data from laboratories shows that it is a slow growing cockroach with varying growth rates. The cockroach eats dried eucalyptus leaves and can also eat fruit and vegetables. Threats The largest threat to the giant burrowing cockroach is habitat destruction. Their main habitat includes forests and land in northern Queensland, which has been cleared intensely from the year 2000. Large centipedes find shelter in the burrows of the cockroaches and can prey on young nymphs. Large spiders also consume young nymphs. Neither spiders nor most centipedes are able to consume adults due to their outer shell, however fully grown Ethmostigmus rubripes would likely be capable of preying on the adult cockroaches.

He is described by Plutarch as an arch-flatterer of Antigonus.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Demetrius, XVII. Antigonus frequently used him on important diplomatic missions and occasionally entrusted him with military commands as well. Career He is first mentioned in 319 BC when he brought Antigonus the news of Antipater's death.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XVIII 47,4. =Greece= In 314 BC Antigonus sent him to the Peloponnese with 1,000 talents, ordered him to maintain friendly relations with Polyperchon and his son Alexander, to collect as large a body of mercenaries, and to conduct the war against Cassander. On his arrival in Laconia, he obtained permission from the Spartans to engage mercenaries in their country, and thus raised an army of 8,000 men in the Peloponnese. In this Aristodemus was outstandingly successful.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XIX 57,5; 60,1; 62,5; 63,3-64,4. The friendship with Polyperchon and his son Alexander was confirmed, and the former was made governor of the peninsula. The ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt, Ptolemy, who was allied with Cassander, sent a fleet against the general and the allies of Antigonus, and Cassander made considerable conquests in the Peloponnese. After his departure, Aristodemus and Alexander at first endeavoured in common to persuade the towns to expel the garrisons of Cassander, and recover their independence. But Alexander soon allowed himself to be made a traitor to the cause he had hitherto espoused, and was rewarded by Cassander with the chief command of his forces in the Peloponnese. In 314, Aristodemus invited the Aetolians to support the cause of Antigonus; and having raised a great number of mercenaries from among them, he attacked Alexander, who was besieging Cyllene, and compelled him to raise the siege. He then restored several other places, such as Patras in Achaea and Dyme in Aetolia, to what was then called freedom. In 312 BC Aristodemus was reinforced by Antigonus's nephews Polemaeus and Telesphorus who both sailed their armies to the Peloponnese.Richard A. Billows, Antigonos the One-Eyed and the Creation of the Hellenistic State, p.373. Under the command of Polemaeus they brought all of Greece south of Thermopylae, except for Athens, into Antigonus's controle. Cassander thereupon opened negotiations with Polemaeus; Artistodemus was one of the negotiators. He was also sent to negotiate with Ptolemy in Egypte. Through his negotiations he helped bring about the peace of 311 BC. In 307 Aristodemus accompanied Demetrius on his great expedition to Greece to liberate Athens.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Demetrius, IX. After Demetrius captured Piraeus Aristodemus was sent into Athens to negotiate with Demetrius of Phaleron, Cassanders's officer in charge of Athens. As a result Cassander's forces withdrew from Athens, and Demetrius was able to proclaim the restoration of Athenian Democracy. =Back in Asia= When Antigonus commanded Demetrius to sail against Ptolemy's forces in Cyprus, Aristodemus accompanied him there.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, Demetrius, 17,2-18,1. He was present during the great naval battle near Cyprian Salamis, where Demetrius annihilated Ptolemy's fleet and captured the island. Aristodemus was chosen to bring the news of the victory to Antigonus at his new city of Antigoneia-on- the-Orontes in Syria. There he was instrumental in an elaborate charade to have Antigonus elevated to kingship. Aristodemus landed from his ship alone and refused to give any indication of the news he bore, he advanced slowly to the royal palace, gathering a large crowd. Meeting the by now worried Antigonus at the palace gate, he cried aloud, \\"Hail, King Antigonus!\\" and described the great victory won. Enthused the assembled crowd proclaimed Antigonus king. =Return to Miletus= After his great moment in Antigoneia Aristodemus went back to Miletus where he entered high office.Richard A.

Through his influence on the art critic T. E. Hulme, his ideas were influential in the development of early British modernism, especially Vorticism. Biography Worringer studied art history in Freiburg, Berlin, and Munich before moving to Bern, where he got his Ph.D. in 1907. His thesis was published the following year under the title Abstraction and Empathy: Essay in the Psychology of Style and remains his best-known work. He taught at Bern University from 1909 to 1914. During this period he got to know members of the Blue Rider group, and he worked with his sister Emmy Worringer to arrange lectures and exhibitions at the avant-garde artists' association known as the Gereonsklub. In 1907 he married Marta Schmitz, a friend of Emmy's who later became a well-known and successful Expressionist artist under her married name of Marta Worringer. After doing military service in World War I, he taught for some years at Bonn University, where he became a professor in 1920. One of his students there was Heinrich L√ºtzeler. Around this time, his interest in avant-garde art began to wane as his interest in German philosophy waxed. He later taught at the universities of K√∂nigsberg (1928‚Äì44) and Halle (1946‚Äì50). In 1950, he moved to Munich, where he remained for the rest of his life. Works In Worringer's first book, the widely read and influential Abstraction and Empathy, he divided art into two kinds: the art of abstraction (which in the past was associated with a more 'primitive' world view) and the art of empathy (which had been associated with realism in the broadest sense of the word, and which was dominant in European art since the Renaissance). Worringer argued, however, that abstract art was in no way inferior to realist art and was worthy of respect in its own right. Following the Austrian art historian Alois Riegl, he argued that what he called \\"the urge to abstraction\\" arises not because of cultural incompetence at mimesis but out of a \\"psychological need to represent objects in a more spiritual manner\\". This turned out to be a broadly appealing justification for the increased use of abstraction in early 20th century European art. Worringer posited a direct relationship between the perception of art and the individual. His claim that \\"we sense ourselves in the forms of a work of art\\" led to a formula, \\"The aesthetic sense is an objectivized sense of the self.\\" He also stated, \\"Just as the desire for empathy as the basis for aesthetic experience finds satisfaction in organic beauty, so the desire for abstraction finds its beauty in the life-renouncing inorganic, in the crystalline, in a word, in all abstract regularity and necessity.\\" Abstraction and Empathy was widely discussed and was especially influential among the German artists of Die Br√ºcke; it also helped spur growing interest in the art of Africa and Southeast Asia. He is credited by philosopher Gilles Deleuze in A Thousand Plateaus as being the first person to see abstraction \\"as the very beginning of art or the first expression of an artistic will.\\" His second book, Form in the Gothic (1911) expanded on ideas in the concluding section of his first book. Focused on Gothic art and architecture, it drew sharp distinctions between northern and southern European versions of the style. He wrote several more books, but none caught on to the same extent as the first two. He consistently championed northern, especially Germanic, forms and styles over those from the Mediterranean, and like fellow art historian Heinrich W√∂lfflin he argued that there was a German style of art that reflected the national character. Some of his ideas were used to prop up Nazism's racialized aesthetics, although the Nazis rejected the German Expressionist art he favored, terming it 'degenerate art'.

The ship was one of 16 Unry≈´-class aircraft carriers planned, although only three were completed before the end of the war. Amagi had a length of overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced . Her crew consisted of 1,595 officers and men.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 56 The Unry≈´-class carriers used the same turbines and boilers as used in the heavy cruiser . These consisted of four geared steam turbine sets with a total of driving four shafts using steam provided by eight Kampon Type B water-tube boilers. The ship had a designed speed of . Amagi carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . She had two funnels on the starboard side, each angled below the horizontal. They were fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 115, 117 =Flight deck arrangements= Amagis flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . A small island was mounted well forward on the starboard side and contained the ship's bridge and air operations control center. It was fitted with a small tripod mast that mounted one of the ship's radar antennas. The ship was designed with two superimposed hangars that were served by two aircraft elevators, each ; the center elevator as used in Hiry≈´ was deleted to simplify construction and reduce stress in the hull. The elevators had a maximum capacity of and took 19 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck. Amagi was fitted with hydraulically operated Type 3 arresting gear with nine cables. She also mounted three Type 3 crash barricades. No aircraft catapult was fitted. The ship mounted a retractable crane on the starboard side of the flight deck, just aft of the rear elevator.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 110‚Äì12, 118 Amagi carried of aviation gasoline for her aircraft.Lengerer 2010a, p. 154 The ship's air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, plus three in storage, 27 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers, plus three in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers plus two in crates. Amagis hangars could not accommodate so many aircraft so eleven planes were planned to be permanently carried on the flight deck. In 1943 the air group was revised to consist of 18 Mitsubishi A7M \\"Sam\\" fighters (+2 in storage), 27 Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\" dive bombers and six Nakajima C6N \\"Myrt\\" reconnaissance aircraft. Of these, the C6Ns were intended to be carried on the flight deck. When the ship commissioned in 1944, neither the A7M nor the C6Ns were yet in service, so the air group was reconfigured to consist of 27 Zeros, 12 D4Ys, three of which were to be the reconnaissance version, and nine Nakajima B6N \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers. By this time, however, the shortage of carrier-qualified aircrew was such that they were ordered to operate from shore bases and Amagi never embarked her air group.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 117‚Äì18 =Armor, armament and sensors= Amagis waterline armored belt was thick over her machinery spaces and over her magazines. Her deck armor above the machinery was thick, but the armor above the magazines was thick.Chesneau, p. 184 The ship's primary armament consisted of a dozen 40-caliber 12.7 cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts on sponsons on the ship's sides.Lengerer, p. 118 Amagi was initially equipped with 16 triple 25 mm Type 96 and three single AA gun mounts, most on sponsons along the sides of the hull. By the end of the war, the ship mounted 22 triple and 23 single mounts.Stille, p. 37 These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. For defense against submarines, the carrier was fitted with six depth charge throwers and carried between six and ten depth charges for them.Lengerer 2010b, p. 119 Two Type 94 high-angle fire-control directors, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a rangefinder. Six Type 95 directors controlled the 25 mm guns and the rocket launchers. Early warning was provided by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radars. One of these was mounted on the top of the island while the other retracted into the port side of the flight deck, between the two elevators. In addition, Amagi had two smaller Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 air search radars, one mounted on the tripod mast on the island and the other on the aft starboard retractable radio mast.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 119‚Äì20 Service Amagi, capsized in Kure harbor, 1946 Amagis keel was laid down by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, on 1 October 1942. She was launched on 15 October 1943 and completed on 10 August 1944. The ship was transferred among a number of ports on the Inland Sea until she arrived in Kure in February 1945 and was ordered to be camouflaged. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima about that same time. Amagi was briefly refitted from 10 to 24 February. On 19 March, the ship was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by one bomb that struck the edge of the flight deck. On 13 April, the ship was permanently moored at an island in Kure harbor and extensively camouflaged. This did not prevent the aircraft from Task Force 38 from locating and attacking the ship on 24 July. She was hit twice and experienced several near-misses. A bomb detonated near the rear funnel, severely damaging it, but doing little other damage aside from blowing a small hole in the starboard hull. A bomb penetrated the flight deck and detonated in the upper hangar, between the elevators. The explosion blew a section of a hangar wall overboard and the walls of the upper hangar deck were bulged and perforated multiple times. The flight deck between the elevators was bulged up and buckled for a length of and the forward elevator was dropped to the bottom of its shaft. It also blew a hole in the upper hangar deck. Fragments from the explosion penetrated into the bowels of the ship, penetrating bulkheads and decks below. Fragments from near-misses penetrated the sides of the port hull and caused the forward bomb magazine, two boiler rooms, and the aft port engine room to flood.Tully The captain ordered the ship abandoned later in the day, and the carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit with a slight list to port and down by the bow. Over the next couple of days, more compartments in the ship flooded and she settled on the bottom of the harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased through the next day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July with part of her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and salvage work began on 5 December. The holes in the ship's hull had to be sealed to pump the water out and decrease her draft. The remains of her flight deck and upper hangar could not be made watertight and were removed using dynamite. Pontoons were used to right the ship and she was refloated on 31 July 1946. The salvage job was conducted by the Hitachi Zosen facility in Kure and they scrapped the ship afterward. The job was completed by 12 December 1947.

In the series, Hitsugaya is a captain of the 10th division or squad of the Gotei 13, a group of Soul Reapers who govern the flow of souls and protect Soul Society, an afterlife realm. Hitsugaya makes appearances in all Bleachs films, being the protagonist in The Diamond Dust Rebellion, as well as and in other media related to the franchise, including video games and original video animations. Hitsugaya's character has been well received among both readers and reviewers. Amongst the Bleach reader base, he has been highly popular, placing high in several popularity polls. Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Hitsugaya's likeness, including action figures, plush toys and key chains. Anime and manga publications have provided acclaim and criticism of Hitsugaya's character. Appearances =In the Bleach manga and anime series= Hitsugaya lived with his grandmother and with Momo Hinamori, whom he considers a very close friend. Hitsugaya excelled in the Soul Reaper academy, becoming the youngest captain in the history of Soul Society with command over Squad 10. Introduced to the Gotei 13, Hitsugaya suspected Squad 3 captain Gin Ichimaru of foul play as the circumstances surrounding the coming execution of Rukia Kuchiki become more complicated. When Hinamori is manipulated into thinking that Hitsugaya killed S≈çsuke Aizen, Hitsugaya attacks Gin on the notion that he tricked her. The fight is interrupted when Hitsugaya dodges an attack that almost kills Hinamori, only to be intercepted by his lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto. Seeing how destructive Rukia's execution is becoming, Hitsugaya tries to stop it by appealing to the Chamber 46, only to discover all members were murdered by Aizen, who faked his death. When Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured, Hitsugaya tries to kill Aizen but is defeated. In a later arc, Hitsugaya leads a group of Soul Reapers assigned to defend Karakura Town against the Arrancar that Aizen has enlisted to his cause. He defeats Shawlong Qufang, and Luppi Antenor, and upon learning that Orihime Inoue has followed the Arrancars back to their home world, Hitsugaya returns to Soul Society to help in the preparation for the war against Aizen. At Karakura Town, he engages the Espada Tier Halibel before she is mortally wounded by Aizen. From there, Hitsugaya engages Aizen, and is tricked into stabs Momo in the chest with Aizen taking advantage of the youth's rage of being tricked to cut his left limbs off. After Aizen's defeat and healed, Hitsugaya resolves to train so that he can more freely use his strongest move as a Soul Reaper, bankai, to protect Hinamori. When Kugo Ginjo steals Ichigo Kurosaki's Fullbring powers, Hitsugaya and several other high-ranking Soul Reapers appear in the human world. To help Ichigo regain his Soul Reaper powers and combat Kugo, captain-commander Genry≈´sai Shigekuni Yamamoto orders the Soul Reapers to give Ichigo some of their spirit energy. Hitsugaya then engages the Fullbringer Yukio Hans Vorarlbena in a cat-and-mouse game, ending with Hitsugaya encasing Yukio in ice, threatening to end his life if he does not release his Fullbring. During the Wandenreich invasion of Soul Society, Hitsugaya loses his bankai to the organization's member Cang Du. But with the help of Kisuke Urahara, Hitsugaya retrieves his bankai from Cang Du and defeat him. However, Hitsugaya ends up as a zombie under the Sternritter Giselle Gewelle. Hitsugaya appears along with a zomified Rangiku as they, Kensei, and Rose fight Mayuri Kurotsuchi's group of revived Arrancars and Squad 11's Ikkaku and Yumichika. Eventually, Mayuri manages to take control of the zombified Soul Reapers with Hitsugaya and Rangiku restored to normal and healed, although their lifespans were shortened. Hitsugaya later joins Byakuya and other Soul Reapers against the sternritter, Gerard. During this battle, the ice petals of Hitsugaya's bankai dissolve. But instead of his bankai deactivating, revealing that the time limit was a sign that it was fully developed prior to the fight, Daiguren Hy≈çrinmarus power reaches its full potential while Hitsugaya is transformed into a young adult to better utilize his improved weapon. =In other media= He appears in all of the four featured films in the series. He fights the Dark Ones with other Soul Reaper comrades in Bleach: Memories of Nobody. He is the main character in Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion, where he is accused of stealing the King's Seal, an ancient artifact, and stumbles across a dark secret concerning a long-dead Soul Reaper named S≈çjir≈ç Kusaka, who was his close friend and rival when he was younger. A one-shot manga chapter focusing on Histugaya's past was released to promote the film, revealing how Hitsugaya learned of his powers. Apparently, Kusaka uses the King's Seal to come back to life for revenge, but in the end is killed by Hitsugaya in a final rematch. He also appears in Bleach: Fade to Black, in which he loses his memories of Ichigo and Rukia, along with the other Soul Reapers. After losing his memories about Rukia's disappearance and Ichigo, Hitsugaya along with other captains try to stop Ichigo from entering the Soul Society. In Hell Verse, he appears to help fight off the Sinners in Karakura Town. Hitsugaya is featured in the 30 minute original video animation, Sealed Sword Frenzy, in which he is part of the group of captains sent to the real world to seal away the escaped and notoriously dangerous shinigami criminal, Baishin. During their first encounter, he successfully fends off the criminal, though Baishin escapes. Hitsugaya is a common playable character in Bleach-related video game, including the Blade Battlers series and the Nintendo home consoles series. Special versions of the character such his bankai form is featured in some games such Soul Resurrecci√≥n, and Hitsugaya in a school costume are unlockable in other games such as Bleach: Shattered Blade. He is also a playable character in the Nintendo DS game, Jump Ultimate Stars. He also appears in two Bleach Beat Collection albums aside. The first one was a compilation album with Hinamori and Matsumoto. The second one was also a compilation album, this time with Ichigo. A Hitsugaya and Hy≈çrinmaru's album was also released as part of Bleach Breathless Collection. He was initially portrayed by Takashi Nagayama in the Bleach rock musicals. Later, in Shinsei Rock Musical Bleach Reprise, Nagayama was replaced by Y≈´ya Kido, who also was substituted; Takuya Kawaharada took the role. Reception Hitsugaya has been highly popular in the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump's Bleach popularity polls ranking most of the times within the top ten. In early 2008, Hitsugaya was voted the most popular character in the series, replacing Ichigo, who had previously held the position. Hy≈çrinmaru was voted the most popular zanpakut≈ç in the zanpakut≈ç popularity poll of the series. In the 2007 Japanese Newtype magazine character polls, he was voted the 9th most popular male character in any anime. In the 28th Annual Animage Readers' Poll, Anime Grand Prix, Hitsugaya was voted as the eighth most popular male anime character. He has also been featured in similar Animage monthly polls. Hitsugaya ranked eighth in 2008 and third in 2009 in a survey titled \\"The Character I Want to Be My Groom\\" from the Japanese music distributor Recochoku. In order to promote the second film of Bleach, the trailer had the line \\"Execute Hitsugaya!\\". Kubo admitted that it was his own idea to make everybody be surprised, but he and Masakazu Morita, the voice actor of Ichigo, received a lot of letters from worried fans, causing Kubo to apologize in response. Various merchandise based on Hitsugaya's appearance has been created, including action figures, plush toys and key chains. Various publications from manga, anime and other media have commented on Hitsugaya's character adding praise and criticism. He has been noted to be one of the most common \\"fan favorite\\" characters from the series. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network praised Steve Staley for giving an interesting variation of his voice rather than \\"integrity-destroying abominations\\". Also, he commented that Hitsugaya's unresolved personal issue is, along with the ones from others characters, a good part from the climax of the Soul Society story arc. He additionally praised the animation of Hitsugaya's bankai in the anime. Later, however, Kimlinger criticized it as \\"it makes him look like an arthritic blue crow\\". IGN's Ramsey Isler lamented the fact that his first fight against an Arrancar was not very entertaining and his character did not \\"get a chance to shine.\\" Hitsugaya's early appearances were criticized by Isaac Hale from Pop Culture Shock who found Kubo was ignoring other characters and giving a lot of attention to him and Matsumoto's gags. However, in a later arc, Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment noted he \\"has a pretty good arc\\" and \\"shine[s] brightly\\" facing Aizen. His appearance in DiamondDust Rebellion were praised by Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood who found his motivations and back story \\"involving and intriguing\\". Similarly, Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment praised \\"how he stands as a man\\" on this film.

He was born on the day of the Haj, or pilgrimage, in 1928 which prompted his parents to attach 'Hajji' to his first name, but he was also born with aposthia, which was seen as an even greater omen for a bright future and thus his name then became Muhammad Anwar Shaikh, with Anwar meaning radiant in the Arabic language. In his youth, Shaikh was an ardent believer of the Sunni branch of Islam his family devoutly practiced, especially his mother since she could recite a large part of the Qur'an from memory. During the violent days of the Partition of India, Shikha became involved with Muslim nationalist groups and fervorously participated in violent attacks they encouraged against non- Muslims. One day, he clubbed and stabbed a Sikh father as well as his young son to death in broad daylight. On another occasion, he bludgeoned another Sikh man he encountered on Darabi road with a long knife. Memories of these crimes have haunted him ever since. When he reached the age of 25, he began doubting Islam and its teachings, and later became an ardent critic. Thereafter he immigrated to the United Kingdom, married a Welsh woman, and became a successful businessman dealing in property development. Around this time, Shikha also converted to the Hindu religion practiced by his ancestors after reading the Rig Veda, which inspired him due to its humanism. He subsequently adopted the name Anirudh Gyan Shikha. The importance of Shaikh's work was recognized by Tariq Ali who devoted a chapter of his book The Clash of Fundamentalisms to his views and the reaction they provoked.The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity, Page, Pg. 157‚Äì165 Shikha was living in Cardiff, Wales, when a fatwa was issued against him from his homeland Pakistan in 1995, where at least fourteen fundamentalist clerics issued death sentences against him for renouncing and criticising Islam. He died in Cardiff on 25 November 2006. Tariq Ali wrote that Anwar Shaikh gained notoriety among British Muslims. Many Muslims around the world, especially those of Desi origin, have been pleading with noted Muslim scholars to write a rebuttal of Anwar Shaikh's ideas.

The station is owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Railway. The full range of tickets for travel are purchased from the guard on the train at no extra cost since there are no retail facilities at this station. It is the closest railway station to Alton Towers to which it is linked by a semi-regular bus service. A taxi rank also exists just next to the station.  History  A 1905 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (upper left) railways in the vicinity of Uttoxeter =North Staffordshire Railway= The present station was built by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) to serve its main line from to . Prior to 1881, three different stations had been in use simultaneously, all being built by the NSR. The section from Stoke-on-Trent to Uttoxeter was opened on 7 August 1848. The first station opened in the town was Uttoxeter Bridge Street station, which opened the same day as the line opened from Stoke. However the station buildings were not complete and temporarily the crossing keeper's hut nearby was used. The following month on 11 September 1848 the line was completed through to Burton and through running between Stoke and Derby began. When the Churnet Valley Line was opened on 13 July 1849, Uttoxeter Junction station was opened on the mainline to serve as an interchange with the Churnet Valley line and on the same date, Uttoxeter Dove Bank station was also opened on the Churnet Valley line. left Uttoxeter then had three stations in total. In 1880, the NSR decided to close all three and construct a north to west line forming a triangular junction. A new Uttoxeter station replaced all three at this new junction and opened on 10 October 1881. There is a model of the 1881 station at the Uttoxeter Heritage Centre. The Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway which opened in 1867 also used the station but this line was operated by the Great Northern Railway. =London, Midland and Scottish Railway= On 1 January 1923, under the Railways Act 1921, the North Staffordshire Railway was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). During this period of time the Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway, which had become part of the London and North Eastern Railway, closed to passengers on 4 December 1939, but the line remained open for goods traffic until 5 March 1951. =British Rail= Local goods train entering Uttoxeter in 1959 The LMS was nationalised in 1948 and became part of British Rail. The last mainline steam train used the station on 16 September 1957 and thereafter an hourly DMU service operated which has been used ever since. Passenger services on the Churnet Valley line from Uttoxeter towards and ceased operation 2 January 1965, and the trains towards Ashbourne and Buxton ceased on 1 November 1954. The last mainline steam train ran on 16 September 1957. The engine sheds closed on 7 December 1964. A siding which was part of the old Churnet valley line remained until the 1980s. The station buildings were destroyed by fire on 9 May 1987 and the station is now unstaffed. =Privatisation= On 2 March 1997, the station became part of the Central Trains franchise. Trains would run from the station to Manchester Airport and Skegness. In 2004, the Manchester Airport train was cut back to Crewe and, in September 2005, the Skegness train was cut short to Derby. The Central Trains franchise expired on 11 November 2007 and the station and its services were taken over by East Midlands Trains. When this franchise expired in August 2019, East Midlands Railway began operations. Today In 2013 a footbridge with disabled access opened at the station, so the level crossing is no longer used to cross the line. There is also now direct access to Uttoxeter Racecourse, which is adjacent to the station, and a car park for the Racecourse on the north side of the line.http://www.uttoxeter-news.co.uk/News/Controversy-over-eyesore-bridge- designed-to-make-station-safe-20131004165724.htm Services Uttoxeter is served by one train per hour in each direction between Crewe and Derby, usually operated by a class 153, 156 or a 158.GB eNRT 2015-16 Edition, Table 50 (Network Rail) During the Midlands Grand National extra trains are provided by East Midlands Railway to cope with the capacity.

His 117 podiums is 2nd all time behind Byrne, what makes this mark impressive is Reynolds scored this in 202 starts. Making him one of a select few riders to finish on the podium in over half their career starts. His first domestic success led him into the 500 cc World Championship on a Padgetts Harris- Yamaha, taking 8 top-10 finishes over two seasons. He joined Rev√© Kawasaki in World Superbikes for 1995, qualifying 2nd at Brands Hatch and taking 3rd-place finishes there and Assen, en route to 10th overall. In 1996 he rode a Suzuki to 12th overall. Although he never did a full season of international racing again, he had a strong record as an occasional rider in future years, taking a win at Brands Hatch in 2000 and a pole position in 2003. In 1997. Reynolds returned to Rev√©, now running Ducatis in the reformed British Superbike series with Red Bull backing. He was immediately a front-runner, finishing in the championship top 5 each year between 1997 and 2000. He took 13 BSB wins in those seasons, and scored points in every BSB race in 2000.

He was championship runner-up in 2003, but was the fastest man by the end of the season. A run of 11 consecutive podiums at the start of 2004 made the title his to lose, and despite a less successful second half of the season he secured the title in the final round. Reynolds broke his leg in testing before the 2005 BSB season. After a poor season, Reynolds had a serious accident at the final round at Brands Hatch during practice on 7 October, breaking four ribs on his right side, puncturing his right lung and breaking his left collarbone, and suffered injuries to his neck and back. Reynolds commented from hospital: \\"When I hit the barrier it was like a switch in my head flipped. Instantly I knew it was time to stop. I had received a warning with my broken leg earlier in the year. I see this as a final warning and I‚Äôve made the decision to stop racing, more for my wife Shelley‚Äôs sanity and for the good of my family than for me.\\" After recovery, Reynolds took up a background role with Rizla Suzuki.

The importance of DKV decreased, and the company lost its leading role in the public transport of Debrecen. Trolleybuses started operating in 1985, taking over several lines which used to be tram-operated until the 1970s. The company became state property on 15 July 1950. Today it is owned by the city. =Trams and trolleybuses= Solaris type low-floor trolley. Between 1970 and 1984 21 FVV trams entered service. The same tram type was used in Budapest, Miskolc and Szeged, trams for the latter two cities were built by DKV. The company still owns eight of them, but they can rarely be seen on the streets. The typical blue trams (KCSV-6) of Debrecen were built between 1993-1997. There are only 11 of them in the whole world, all of them in Debrecen. The company also owns an old nostalgia tram. The trolleybuses ZiU-9 were manufactured in the Soviet Union, 26 of them entered service since 1985. The four articulated trolleybuses have been in use since 1991. New Solaris Trollino buses are being bought since April 2005, in place of the old Soviet buses. In October 2011 the Spanish firm CAF will be in charge of supply of 18 32-metre Urbos low-floor trams delivered from 2014, for the second tram line which was opened in late February 2014. = Buses = Since 2009, bus services have also been operated by DKV (expect the 3 \\"CORA\\" bus lines, which is still operated by Hajd√∫ Vol√°n).Currently,there are over 50 routes (only about 30, if routes with A/Y/I/E or 1 signed bus lines are not counted) and 3 bus types:Volvo Alfa Civis 12,18, Mercedes-Benz Conecto G and ITK Reform 500LE (there only 1 from the last type).

It is a form of worship/praise most often seen in the Black Church and in non-Black Pentecostal churches, and can be celebratory, supplicatory, intercessory, or a combination thereof. History The shout music tradition originated within the church music of the Black Church, parts of which derive from the ring shout tradition of slaves from West Africa. As these slaves, who were concentrated in the southeastern United States, incorporated West African shout traditions into their newfound Christianity, the Black Christian shout tradition emerged‚Äîalbeit it not in all Black churches or in every part of the country. In the North prior to the 1930s, many Black Christians preferred a more quiet, reserved form of worship akin to their White Christian neighbors. Even so, after the dawn of the Azusa Street Revival and the rise of Pentecostalism in 1906, many Black Christians began to incorporate more modern Charismatic Christian practices into their worship, including speaking in tongues and various other bodily anomalies said to be caused by the Holy Spirit. The shout tradition fit well into this framework and became ever more popular across the spectrum of Pentecostalism and, eventually, the larger Charismatic Evangelical world. As Southern Black Christians migrated north in large numbers and began to set up shop (after realizing their more rambunctious worship was not welcome in these northern Black churches), the center of power shifted in their direction. At the same time, a new form of Black gospel music emerged, influenced both by the Black spiritual tradition as well as the growing Pentecostal/Holiness movements. This perfect storm led to the high-energy, fast-paced shouts and praise breaks seen in churches today. It is common in the present day for gospel recording artists to include shouts and praise breaks on their albums, either recorded in a studio or live during a recorded show. This has had an outsize influence on the spread (and musical structure) of the tradition in modern times. Sound There are many variations of this particular style of music. In its most standard form, shout music is characterized by very fast tempo, chromatic basslines and piano/organ chords, snare hits and hand claps on the upbeat of each beat. The organist typically plays dominant 7 chords while improvising over riffs, while the pianist typically plays counter rhythms to the established rhythmic structure. Often bands will break into shout music at the end of a song or as a finale, or at a particularly high emotional point during a church service or sermon‚Äîoften cued by the singer or speaker themselves. Shouts following a sermon often come at the end of an instance of \\"whooping\\". The structure of Black Church bands varies greatly, but all typically have a few basic instruments in common: a basic drum kit, bass guitar, and an organ and/or piano. Shouts typically lack sheet music and can vary from less than a minute to as long as over an hour and may span many different songs. Usually there is an instrumentalist guiding the structure and flow musically, though standard shout music is often used as a bed for vocal riffing and calling out of exclamatory catch phrases or \\"shouts\\" (e.g. \\"Hallelujah!\\" or \\"Thank you, Lord!\\") by a singer or minister during the experience. = UHOP (brass-based) = The United House of Prayer For All People (UHOP), an African-American denomination founded in 1919 in Massachusetts, is particularly known for its shout bands and distinctive form of shout music: brass players, predominantly trombone-based, inspired by jazz, blues and Dixieland, gospel and old-time spirituals: a more soulful/spiritual version of a New Orleans brass band. In this more brass-based type of shout music (less common in mainstream Black churches but often seen in parades, clubs, UHOP churches, and elsewhere), there are usually three sections: the recitive and call, which involves a musical statement from the trombones; the aria, which develops the melody and tempo; and the shout, the ending call-and-response. As the song progresses, the sound intensifies from a whisper at the beginning to an exuberant crescendo during the shout. This kind of shout music is made to closely emulate the exact sound and techniques used by the voices of singers and choirs, including but not limited to vibratos, slurs, and glissandi. This is the primary reason that a trombone is typically found as the lead instrument. Also common are baritones, a snare drum and bass drum combination, and a sousaphone. Though they are not usually seen, other instruments are also utilized in such shout bands, including trumpets, flugelhorns, saxophones, clarinets, flutes, washboards and more. These specialized, brass-based shout bands are often mistaken for trad jazz bands due to similarities in instrumentation and style, and there are as many as eight different leaders controlling different aspects of the band. There is usually a player-conductor that controls everything that happens, but he or she is normally listening to the band as a whole whereas the other leaders are listening to specific parts that they are assigned to.

At its peak, it was the second-largest circus in America next to Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus. It was based in Peru, Indiana. History The circus began as the ‚ÄúCarl Hagenbeck Circus‚Äù by Carl Hagenbeck (1844‚Äì1913). Hagenbeck was an animal trainer who pioneered the use of rewards-based animal training as opposed to fear-based training.Hagenbeck, Carl, Beasts and men. Being Carl Hagenbeck's experiences for half a century among wild animals. (London & New York: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1912). p. x‚Äìxi. Meanwhile, Benjamin Wallace, a livery stable owner from Peru, Indiana, and his business partner, James Anderson, bought a circus in 1884 and created \\"The Great Wallace Show\\". The show gained some prominence when their copyright for advertising posters was upheld by the Supreme Court in Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Company. Wallace bought out his partner in 1890 and formed the \\"B. E. Wallace Circus\\". In 1907, Wallace purchased the Carl Hagenbeck Circus and merged it with his circus. The circus became known as the Hagenbeck-Wallace circus at that time, even though Carl Hagenbeck protested. He sued to prohibit the use of his name but lost in court. In March 1913, the circus lost 8 elephants, 21 lions and tigers and 8 performing horses in the Great Flood of 1913. That same year, Wallace sold his interest in the circus to Ed Ballard of French Lick, Indiana. Another tragedy struck the circus before 4:00 a.m. on June 22, 1918, in the Hammond Circus Train Wreck when the engineer of an empty troop train fell asleep, and collided into the rear of the Hagenbeck-Wallace circus train near Hammond, Indiana. A fire broke out from the kerosene lamps, which were used for lighting in the sleeping cars of the circus train. The fire quickly spread through the wood-constructed cars. As a result of the collision and subsequent fire, 86 persons died and another 127 were injured. Many victims were burned beyond recognition. Most are buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois in a section set aside as Showmen's Rest. In the spirit of \\"the show must go on\\", several competing circuses, including Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey, lent equipment and performers to Hagenbeck-Wallace so that only two performances were canceled as a result of the tragedy, the one in Hammond and the next stop in Monroe, Wisconsin. After the tragedy, circus entrepreneurs Jeremiah Mugivan and Bert Bowers acquired Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, adding it to a long list of circuses they owned, including Sells-Floto Circus and John Robinson Shows. Mugivan was the chief operations man. A year later, Mugivan and Bowers asked Ballard to join them and the trio formed the American Circus Company. The successor company of the American Circus Corporation was sold by Jeremiah Mugivan, Bert Bowers and Ed Ballard to John Nicholas Ringling of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey in 1929 for $1.7 million (US$ in ), along with Al G. Barnes Circus, Sells-Floto Circus, John Robinson Shows, and Sparks Circus. The circus spent its winters just outside Baldwin Park, California. There, on 35 acres of land, the circus stayed with its huge parade wagons parked alongside a railroad spur. The elephants spent time hauling refuse wagons, shunting railroad cars and piling baled hay. A tent at the eastern edge of the grounds was used by aerialists to practice trapeze and high-wire acts. The circus usually remained there from late November to early spring.Los Angeles: A Guide to the City and Its Environs, p. 306, Hastings House Publishing, NY, 1941. The Great Depression and Ringling's ill health caused the Ringling empire to falter. In 1935, the circus split from Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey and became the Hagenbeck-Wallace and Forepaugh-Sells Bros. Circus. It finally ceased operations in 1938, seventy-nine years before Ringling itself closed. The complex near Peru that formerly housed the winter home of Hagenbeck-Wallace now serves as the home of the Circus Hall of Fame. In fiction The Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus was the inspiration for the novel The Circus in Winter by Cathy Day. The book is about the fictional \\"Great Porter Circus\\", which made its winter home in \\"Lima, Indiana\\", which stood in for the author's home town of Peru, Indiana. The author is the great-niece of an elephant trainer of the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. Hagenbeck's name also appears in a series of Polish books for teenagers by Alfred Szklarski. The main characters from the books travel around the world to hunt animals for Hagenbeck's circus. Hagenbeck is also mentioned in the story \\"First Love\\" by Samuel Beckett, where the protagonist reminisces about a visit to Ohlsdorf Cemetery. He is also briefly mentioned in the novel, Water for Elephants. by Sara Gruen. In the fall of 2006 The Neo- Futurists theater company of Chicago mounted an original production entitled Roustabout: The Great Circus Train Wreck! based on the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. The play was written by Jay Torrence and directed by Torrence and Kristie Koehler. The show was remounted by the Neo-Futurists in the summer of 2007 at the Chicago Park District's Theater on the Lake. In 2013, a production of the play was presented by Concordia University Chicago.

The name is Welsh for \\"Aman Valley\\" and the River Aman flows through the village. Cwmaman literally means: valley of the river Aman. It lies in the valley of several mountains. Within the village, there are two children's playgrounds and playing fields. At the top of the village there are several reservoirs accessible from several footpaths along the river. The postal district is Aberdare. History Cwmaman was a well-known coal-mining village which, at one time boasted several collieries. Until the 19th century, the town was virtually uninhabited, with around 40 farm workers living in and around the community by 1841. By the end of the 1840s, the first coal pits were sunk and Cwmaman began to transform into a thriving industrial settlement, in the later years of the 19th century Cwmaman housed the workers of five surrounding coal mines - the Fforchaman, Fforchneol, Bedwlwyn, Cwmneol, and the Cwmaman. Cwmaman Colliery was also known as Shepherd‚Äôs Pit, in honour of its founder Thomas Shepherd, a name it shares with the village‚Äôs first public house, the Shepherd‚Äôs Arms, which was opened in 1850. There is an array of parallel roads in the east part of the village. Burns Street and Spencer Street, along with the other streets collectively known as Poets' Corner, are amongst the steepest in the United Kingdom.  Culture  Cwmaman Public Hall and Institute The band Stereophonics comes from Cwmaman. On 14 December 2007, in association with Jo Whiley and her BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge Tour, the band returned to Cwmaman to play an exclusive acoustic gig at the Cwmaman Working Men's Club, the venue where the band first performed. The village is home to the war poet Alun Lewis, and a plaque in Llanwonno Road marks the house where he lived. Born in 1915, Lewis was strongly influenced by his formative years in the depression-era valley. He was also influenced by local issues of his community in the then-called Aberdare Leader and this is demonstrated in his poem \\"The Mountain over Aberdare\\", which touches on the desperate poverty that beset the Cynon Valley and the country in this period. However, it was for his war poems, published in two volumes, Raiders Dawn and Ha! Ha! Among the Trumpets, that Lewis‚Äôs reputation was made. The village‚Äôs Cwrt Alun Lewis flats are named in his honour. Cwmaman Public Hall & Institute is a community- owned enterprise consisting of a concert room, theatre / cinema and fitness suite St. Joseph's Church was renovated in 2007. This work included the installation of solar panels on one side of its roof with the aim to sell back energy to the National Grid. The Cwmaman Music Festival is held at the last weekend of September every year. It started in 2008 and has attracted artists such as Alabama 3, Mike Peters, Killing for Company and many unsigned artists from around the Cynon Valley. Religion Religion played a central role in the life of the village until the second half off the 20th century. Seion, Cwmaman remained an active place of worship until its closure, for financial reasons, in 2013. The congregation still meets at the former Moriah Aman Congregational Chapel, now an evangelical church. The third Welsh language chapel in the village was Soar, a Calvinistic Methodist church which closed in the late 1980s and which has now been demolished. Cwmaman was particularly affected by the Religious Revival of 1904-05 which had an impact throughout the Cynon Valley. In January 1905 it was reported that meetings were being held every evening at the various chapels and a number of secular organisations had abandoned their meetings for the time being. Later that month, another report stated that outdoor meetings were being held in relation to the revival, and that prayer meetings were being held in the mornings at Cwmaman Colliery.  Regeneration and the community  Fragile Earth by Paul Clarke Cwmaman is a Communities First area, officially recognised as needing Welsh Assembly support to assist the community solve problems of social disadvantage. The Cwmaman Communities First Partnership was established in October 2001 aiming to bring individuals, voluntary groups and public and private sector organisations in the community together to help create a better future for the area. Many innovative environmental projects have taken place including the hosting of an environmental festival centred on St Joseph's Church, holding a sculpture exhibition, the development of a community woodland walk, and establishing a Cwmaman Sculpture Trail. A range of sculptors have contributed to projects in the village, including Robert Koenig, Dai Edwards, Tom Harvey, Godfrey Phillips, Paul Clarke, Dave Lloyd, Dominic Claire and Peter Boyd. On 25 September 2018, the much acclaimed Netflix Original show \\"the Crown\\" came to Cwmaman to film scenes for its second series. Local children were asked to volunteer as extras for the scenes, along with many houses and Glynhafod Junior School being used as significant parts of the set for the scenes filmed. Politics Cwmaman was a traditional Labour Party stronghold, although in more recent times it has been challenged by Plaid Cymru and the Cynon Valley Party. It lies in the Aberaman South electoral ward, currently represented by Councillor Tina Williams (Labour).

In: Meddelelser om Gr√∏nland 41, 1913, pp. 1‚Äì270 Knud Rasmussen's First Thule Expedition confirmed in 1912 that Peary Land is a peninsula. There are more than 200 kilometers of dry land up to 1500 meters high between Nordenski√∂ld Fjord and Independence Fjord. =Research and mining= There are two Arctic research stations on J√∏rgen Br√∏nlund Fjord, Br√∏nlundhus (erected in 1948) and Kap Harald Moltke (erected in 1972). Both stations were built on initiative of Eigil Knuth, and have been the basis for many scientific expeditions. Kap Harald Moltke station was built later in connection with use of the natural runway east of J√∏rgen Br√∏nlund Fjord mouth. The stations located 10 km from each other on either side of the fjord, with Br√∏nlundhus on the western side, and communication between them in summer is by boat, depending on ice conditions. Since the death of Eigil Knuth, the stations are administered by Peary Land Foundation. Today, Br√∏nlundhus can be characterised as a museum, with a collection of artefacts from polar explorations. In 1993 zinc and lead deposits were discovered in the Citronen Fjord.Citronen Lead-Zinc Project They are deemed the largest yet unexploited zinc deposits in the world and the exploitation of the Citronen mine is in the preparation phase.Shipping from northern Greenlandic mine feasible, owner says Important zinc and barium deposits have also been found at Navarana Fjord.Zinc potential at Navarana Fjord -Greenlands minerals authority  Geography  Peary Land is bounded by the Lincoln Sea (west of Cape Morris Jesup) and Wandel Sea of the Arctic Ocean in the north. Oodaaq island, the northernmost point of land of the world, lies off the north coast. Frederick E. Hyde Fjord, which cuts into Peary Land from the east 150 km deep, divides it into Northern Peary Land and Southern Peary Land. The coastline is deeply indented by smaller fjords, such as G.B. Schley Fjord and Hellefisk Fjord in the east, and Sands Fjord, Benedict Fjord, J.P. Koch Fjord, De Long Fjord and Weyprecht Fjord in the west. Peary Land is not part of any municipality, but belongs to the Northeast Greenland National Park. The size of the region is about 375 km east‚Äìwest and 200 km north‚Äìsouth, with an estimated area of 57 000 km2. It is only a bit more than 700 km south of the North Pole. Peary Land is not covered by an ice cap because the air is too dry to produce snow. Precipitation levels are so low (only about 25 to 200 mm per year) that most of its surface is polar desert. Located mostly north of the 82¬∞N parallel, it contains the most northerly ice-free region of the world, mostly in Southern Peary Land (such as Melville Land and Herlufsholm Strand north of Independence Fjord). It was not covered by glaciers during the most recent ice age. However, in its western part, there is the Hans Tausen Ice Cap with ice at least 344 m thick. =Mountains= Peary Land is mountainous; the highest elevation is Helvetia Tinde reaching up to in the heavily glaciated and little-explored Roosevelt Range, the northernmost mountain range in the world.Liviu Ivanescu, Arctic astronomy high Wistar Bjerg,Den gr√∏nlandske Lods - GeodatastyrelsenProstar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 130 high Stjernebannertinde, highest point of the H.H.

Peary Land - location within Greenland }  Flora and fauna  Musk oxen and Peary Land collared lemmings are supported by the sparse vegetation, which covers only about 5% of the surface, mostly in the area around J√∏rgen Br√∏nlund Fjord. Other fauna includes Arctic fox, polar wolf, polar bear, and Arctic hare. In former times there were also caribou, but the last live caribou reported from Northern Greenland were seen in Hall Land in 1922.Morten Meldgaard, Greenland Caribou - Zoogeography, Taxonomy, and Population Dynamics. P. 44 The flora includes 33 species of flowering plants. One to two million years ago, when climates were warmer, trees such as larch, black spruce, birch, yew, and thuja grew in northernmost Peary Land.

He is the anchor of the \\"most accurate news on television\\" His voice is performed by Pedro Peirano (creator, director and writer of the series). It is based (to some extent) on journalists Bernardo de la Maza and Fernando Paulsen. He is from the fictional town of Titirilqu√©n. Personality He is distracted and eccentric. He has the bad habit of being a compulsive shopper, buying things that will never be useful. He is very egocentric, and finds it difficult to think of anything but himself. The viewing audience considers him a bit stupid, but basically good-hearted. Thanks to his friend Juan Carlos Bodoque, he could reach the 31 Minutes news program. Family Although it has been revealed he has several family members on more than one occasion, the only ones who have been in the program are his mother and the only daughter of his sister Morticia Felicinda, but a naughty girl named Patricia Ann Tufillo, better known as Patana, who works as a reporter in charge of his uncle. Tulio has never borne a child. Romantic life In the early episodes of the program, Tulio showed a marked interest in his colleague Carla Rubio, he was rejected again and again by his cold coworker. Also, at the beginning of the second season his relationship with Cindy Miraflores, (a girl with a small problem with pronunciation, who at first was only considered a summer romance passenger, but who end up in formal, even at long distance as she lives in the remote village of Titiritalca), was made public. He looks at another time during the second season, claiming Tulio because he had told the program she worked on was educational, which was false. Friendships Somewhat naively, Tulio seems to regard Juan Carlos Bodoque as his best friend, and knew each other since they were children and even were part of the same Scout group, the Pack Apumanque. Although their relationship is far from perfect, deep down they care for each other. Beyond that, Tulio is quite friendly with the rest of the staff. Although he is sometimes rather rough with Juan√≠n also seems to have a good friendship with this shy character as many Vaces shouts the phrase \\"party at Juanin's\\".

History Gordon founded Xing on the basis of a simple JPEG decoding library that he had developed. This software attracted the attention of Chris Eddy, who had developed a technique for processing discrete cosine transforms (DCT) efficiently through software. Eddy's technique helped create the first Xing MPEG video player, a very simple MS-DOS application that could play back an I-frame-only video MPEG stream encoded at a constant quantization level at 160x120 resolution. Over the next several years, Xing expanded in several directions: Windows support for the XingMPEG player, a software MPEG audio decoder, a real time ISA 160x120 MPEG capture board (XingIt!), a JPEG management system (Picture Prowler) and finally networking. Xing released a handful of network products before StreamWorks, the first streaming audio and video system for the Internet, with support for both live and pre-encoded sources. RealVideo appeared just before StreamWorks, but at the time it was known as RealAudio and could only broadcast audio. It could not transmit video. After StreamWorks was launched the company raised $5M in venture capital, but RealNetworks raised considerably more and began to out execute Xing. Despite that Xing experienced a period of expansion through its \\"Audio Catalyst\\" MP3 software and \\"MP3 Grabber\\". Xing was bought by RealNetworks in 1999. References *Bert J.

It was backed by C. Jared Ingersoll, a Philadelphia industrialist who owned coal mining properties in Indian Territory (now part of the state of Oklahoma).\\"Midland Valley Depot in Pawhuska, OK.\\" Accessed May 11, 2015. The railroad took its name from Midland, Arkansas, a coal mining town in western Arkansas, which was served by the railroad. The Midland Valley gained access to Fort Smith, Arkansas via trackage rights over the Frisco from Rock Island, Oklahoma. In 1967, the Midland Valley Railroad was merged into the Texas & Pacific Railroad, which was absorbed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1983. Midland Valley is now extinct. History MV reached Tulsa in 1904, and completed construction of its initial system in 1906 upon reaching Arkansas City, Kansas. The same year it opened a branch to the Glenn Pool oil field, which generated a lot of traffic and stimulated MV's revenues. MV extended that line as far as Kiefer, but closed the Glenn Pool-Kiefer section in 1936. Wichita, Kansas was reached in 1911, with the lease of the Wichita and Midland Valley railroad. Service to Wichita ended in 1966, and the northern section of the road was pared back to Barnsdall, Oklahoma. Passenger service ended in 1934. Competition from other railroads caused a decline in MV's fortunes, especially during the Great Depression.Augustus J. Veenendaal, Jr., \\"Midland Valley Railroad,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed May 11, 2015. Muskogee, Oklahoma, was home to the Midland Valley's headquarters and shops. In 1925, the Midland Valley acquired the Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway. Both railroads were owned by the Muskogee Company, a holding company, which purchased a third railroad Oklahoma City-Ada-Atoka Railway in 1929. Muskogee Company was headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The only serious accident on the Midland Valley system occurred February 1, 1958. Westbound train 41 collided head-on with eastbound train 42 on the curve at Bokoshe, Oklahoma. Four crew members died and seven were injured. End of the line All three railroads were operated as more or less common property by the Muskogee Company until sale of all three to the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MoPac) in 1964. The Midland Valley was merged into the Texas & Pacific Railroad (T&P;), a MoPac subsidiary on April 1, 1967. MoPac merged into the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) in 1983. Operated as branchlines for a number of years, most of the Midland Valley has now been abandoned. But much of the former route has been converted from rail to trail, such as the 14.5 mile Osage Prairie Trail between Tulsa and Skiatook.

The band has released six albums, with seven released singles. They are currently signed to Nuclear Blast Records. History = Formation and Symmetric in Design (2004‚àí2005) = Drummer Henrik Ohlsson is the band's main lyricist. Formed in April 2004, Scar Symmetry came together during the band Altered Aeon's recording session at Jonas Kjellgren's Black Lounge Studios by guitarists Jonas Kjellgren, Per Nilsson and drummer Henrik Ohlsson. That same month, vocalist Christian √Ñlvestam and bassist Kenneth Seil joined the band, which then recorded a demo for the song \\"Seeds of Rebellion\\" which helped the band get a recording contract with Cold Records (a subsidiary of Metal Blade Records). In July 2004, the band entered Black Lounge Studios to begin recording its debut album, Symmetric in Design. It followed it up by playing festivals in Europe, as well as touring with Soilwork, Hypocrisy, and One Man Army. = Pitch Black Progress (2006‚àí2007) = In June 2006, the band signed a new record deal with Nuclear Blast records. Eight months after the release of Symmetric in Design the band started recording its follow-up, Pitch Black Progress. The band again followed up its recording by touring, this time with Communic for the Waves of Pitch Black Decay Tour 2006 throughout Europe, and they toured North America with melodic death metal pioneers Dark Tranquillity and The Haunted. The song \\"The Illusionist\\" began receiving air-play on MTV2's Headbangers Ball. In September 2007, the band embarked on another North American tour with headliners Katatonia, Insomnium, and Swallow the Sun, the \\"Live Consternation Tour\\". = Holographic Universe and new vocalists (2008‚àí2009) = The band's third album, Holographic Universe, was released on 20 June 2008. Following the release, despite an outpouring of good reviews and press for the album as well as the success of the single for \\"Morphogenesis\\", Scar Symmetry did not embark on tours. The band released a statement on 11 September 2008 announcing that they had fired vocalist Christian √Ñlvestam, due to touring conflicts, creative and personal differences. On 6 October, they announced the replacements for √Ñlvestam; they would continue with two singers, Roberth Karlsson (growls and clean backing vocals) and Lars Palmqvist (clean vocals and backing growls), and began touring in support of the new album in December. = Dark Matter Dimensions (2009‚àí2010) = The band's fourth album, Dark Matter Dimensions, was released on 2 October 2009 in Europe, and on 20 October 2009 in the US. It is the band's first album to feature new vocalists Karlsson and Palmqvist. Despite the replacement of previous singer, the album received generally positive reviews upon its release. A music video was filmed for the songs \\"Noumenon & Phenomenon\\", \\"Ascension Chamber\\" and \\"The Iconoclast\\". From late October 2009, Scar Symmetry took part in the Neckbreakers Ball Tour alongside Behemoth, DevilDriver and Arsis. In February 2010, Scar Symmetry announced that they were to support head-liners Hypocrisy at the \\"A Taste of Extreme Divinity\\" tour. Towards the end of 2010, they toured with Epica in the United States and Canada, starting in West Springfield, Virginia on 16 November, and finishing in Raleigh, North Carolina on 18 December. =The Unseen Empire (2011-2013)= Scar Symmetry's fifth album, titled The Unseen Empire, was released in Europe on 18 April 2011. Drummer Henrik Ohlsson states that the title of the album \\"seeks to expose the hidden hand of the elite that pull the strings of mankind in order to fulfill their agenda of global domination\\". The album is the band's best-selling yet in the United States in terms of first-week sales. It sold 1,500 copies, landing it at number 11 on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart. The band unofficially started to write their next record. In August 2013, the band announced that guitarist Jonas Kjellgren had left the band due to scheduling conflicts with his studio work and his other bands Raubtier and Bourbon Boys. Kjellgren has not been replaced officially, but his place is occasionally taken by session guitarists for live shows. =The Singularity trilogy (2014-present)= On 20 January 2014, the band announced that they were working on a trilogy of albums, all revolving around the theme of transhumanism. The artwork for the first in the series of albums, The Singularity (Phase I ‚Äì Neohumanity) was revealed on the same day, along with a short clip of a pre-production demo for the new album. This album marks the first Scar Symmetry album to be produced, mixed and mastered entirely by Per Nilsson.  Phase I ‚àí Neohumanity  The band explained that the first part of the trilogy would be centred on the rise of \\"artilects (artificial intellects) with mental capacities far above the human level of thought\\" and that \\"by the year 2030, one of the world's biggest industries will be 'artificial brains,' used to control artilects that will be genuinely intelligent and useful.\\" As well as this, the lyrical content will focus on the divide between \\"those who embrace the new technology and those who oppose it\\" due to the social issues caused by the rise of artificial intelligence and the emergence of transhumanists adding artilect technology to their own bodies.  Phase II ‚àí Xenotaph  On 9 January 2015, Scar Symmetry announced that vocalist Roberth Karlsson had a child on the way, so the band would not do any touring until the fall of 2015, at the earliest. In the meantime, throughout 2015, Per Nilsson and Henrik Ohlsson would be writing Phase II of the planned album trilogy. Jokingly, they stated that the album would be entitled, Phase II: The Force Awakens, but then later clarified that the actual album title would be \\"much cooler\\", and did not want to risk a lawsuit over naming their album after the new Disney owned Star Wars film. On 16 November, announcements were made to enter the studio and record Phase II after finishing the tour the week after. On 7 December, Phase II has just started being recorded. In February 2017, via their Facebook page, Scar Symmetry announced that album will be released in 2017. However, as of 2020, there has been no release of Phase II. On 29 October 2018, the band announced full title of the upcoming seventh album as The Singularity (Phase II ‚àí Xenotaph). On 12 March 2019, Scar Symmetry announced that bassist Andreas Holma had resigned from the band, due to a touring dispute.

He received awards for his works which connect illustrations with the written text, sometimes texts by others.  Life  Born in Berlin, Meckel spent his youth there, in Erfurt and in Freiburg im Breisgau, where he attended Gymnasium. In 1954/55 he studied graphic art at the Academy of Art in Freiburg im Breisgau, and in 1956 at the Academy of Art in M√ºnchen. Since 1956 he worked as both an author and graphic artist. His first poem appeared that year. He traveled extensively through Europe, Africa, and America and lived in Oetingen in Markgr√§flerland, in Berlin, in southern France, and in Tuscany. His graphic work has appeared in numerous exhibitions. Until his withdrawal in 1997, Meckel was a member of the PEN Center of the Federal Republic of Germany. He was a member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz and the Deutschen Akademie f√ºr Sprache und Dichtung in Darmstadt. In her book \\"For Your Own Good: Hidden Cruelty in Childrearing and the Roots of Violence\\" Alice Miller provides quotes of Meckel on his childhood: Punishment followed on a grand scale. For ten days, an unconscionable length of time, my father blessed the palms of his child's outstretched four-year-old hands with a sharp twitch. Seven strokes a day on each hand: that makes one hundred and forty strokes and then some. This put an end to the child's innocence. Whatever it was that happened in Paradise involving Adam, Eve, Lilith, the serpent, and the apple, the well-deserved Biblical thunderbolt of prehistoric times, the roar of the Almighty and His pointed finger signifying expulsion ‚Äì I know nothing about all that. It was my father who drove me out of paradise. Meckel died in Freiburg on 29 January 2020, aged 84.

In graph theory, the Cartesian product G square H of graphs G and H is a graph such that * the vertex set of G square H is the Cartesian product V(G) √ó V(H); and * two vertices (u,u' ) and (v,v' ) are adjacent in G square H if and only if either ** u = v and u' is adjacent to v' in H, or ** u' = v' and u is adjacent to v in G. The Cartesian product of graphs is sometimes called the box product of graphs [Harary 1969]. The operation is associative, as the graphs (F square G) square H and F square (G square H) are naturally isomorphic. The operation is commutative as an operation on isomorphism classes of graphs, and more strongly the graphs G square H and H square G are naturally isomorphic, but it is not commutative as an operation on labeled graphs. The notation G √ó H has often been used for Cartesian products of graphs, but is now more commonly used for another construction known as the tensor product of graphs. The square symbol is an intuitive and unambiguous notation for the Cartesian product, since it shows visually the four edges resulting from the Cartesian product of two edges. Examples * The Cartesian product of two edges is a cycle on four vertices: K2 square K2 = C4. * The Cartesian product of K2 and a path graph is a ladder graph. * The Cartesian product of two path graphs is a grid graph. * The Cartesian product of n edges is a hypercube: :: (K_2)^{square n} = Q_n. :Thus, the Cartesian product of two hypercube graphs is another hypercube: Qi square Qj = Qi+j. * The Cartesian product of two median graphs is another median graph. * The graph of vertices and edges of an n-prism is the Cartesian product graph K2 square Cn. * The rook's graph is the Cartesian product of two complete graphs.  Properties  If a connected graph is a Cartesian product, it can be factorized uniquely as a product of prime factors, graphs that cannot themselves be decomposed as products of graphs.; . However, describe a disconnected graph that can be expressed in two different ways as a Cartesian product of prime graphs: :(K1 + K2 + K22) square (K1 + K23) = (K1 + K22 + K24) square (K1 + K2), where the plus sign denotes disjoint union and the superscripts denote exponentiation over Cartesian products. A Cartesian product is vertex transitive if and only if each of its factors is., Theorem 4.19. A Cartesian product is bipartite if and only if each of its factors is. More generally, the chromatic number of the Cartesian product satisfies the equation :œá(G square H) = max {œá(G), œá(H)}. The Hedetniemi conjecture states a related equality for the tensor product of graphs. The independence number of a Cartesian product is not so easily calculated, but as showed it satisfies the inequalities :Œ±(G)Œ±(H) + min{V(G)-Œ±(G),V(H)-Œ±(H)} ‚â§ Œ±(G square H) ‚â§ min{Œ±(G) V(H), Œ±(H) V(G)}. The Vizing conjecture states that the domination number of a Cartesian product satisfies the inequality :Œ≥(G square H) ‚â• Œ≥(G)Œ≥(H). The Cartesian product of unit distance graphs is another unit distance graph. Cartesian product graphs can be recognized efficiently, in linear time.. For earlier polynomial time algorithms see and .  Algebraic graph theory  Algebraic graph theory can be used to analyse the Cartesian graph product. If the graph G_1 has n_1 vertices and the n_1times n_1 adjacency matrix mathbf A_1, and the graph G_2 has n_2 vertices and the n_2times n_2 adjacency matrix mathbf A_2, then the adjacency matrix of the Cartesian product of both graphs is given by : mathbf A_{1square 2} = mathbf A_1 otimes mathbf I_{n_2} + mathbf I_{n_1} otimes mathbf A_2, where otimes denotes the Kronecker product of matrices and mathbf I_n denotes the ntimes n identity matrix. The adjacency matrix of the Cartesian graph product is therefore the Kronecker sum of the adjacency matrices of the factors.  Category theory  Viewing a graph as a category whose objects are the vertices and whose morphisms are the paths in the graph, the cartesian product of graphs corresponds to the funny tensor product of categories. The cartesian product of graphs is one of two graph products that turn the category of graphs and graph homomorphisms into a symmetric closed monoidal category (as opposed to merely symmetric monoidal), the other being the tensor product of graphs. The internal hom [G, H] for the cartesian product of graphs has graph homomorphisms from G to H as vertices and \\"unnatural transformations\\" between them as edges.  History  According to , Cartesian products of graphs were defined in 1912 by Whitehead and Russell. They were repeatedly rediscovered later, notably by .

He was a Progressive Conservative member who served in the cabinets of John Robarts and Bill Davis. Background Born in New Brunswick, Wishart obtained his law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1930, and then practised in Windsor and Blind River. Politics He served as mayor of Blind River before moving to Sault Ste. Marie. In the 1963 provincial election, he was elected the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Sault Ste. Marie. He entered the cabinet within a year as Attorney General of Ontario under then Premier John Robarts. He served in that senior cabinet portfolio for seven years, and is credited with shepherding many important pieces of legislation, including the Legal Aid Act of 1966 and the Law Enforcement Compensation Act of 1967. In 1967, Wishart fired Morton Shulman from his position as Chief Coroner of Metropolitan Toronto as a result of Shulman's criticisms of the government's failure to follow various recommendations made in coroner's inquiries. The dismissal propelled Shulman, until then a long-time Tory, into politics as a candidate and then MPP for the New Democratic Party. In early 1971, Wishart became Minister of Financial and Consumer Affairs under Robarts's successor, Bill Davis, and served until retiring from politics at the 1971 provincial election. Wishart was very active on the issue of franchises while he was Minister of Finance and Minister of Consumer and Commercial Affairs. He initiated the Grange Commission, an inquiry held into the financial abuse of franchisees by franchisors. The Arthur Wishart (Franchise Disclosure) Act, passed in 2000 was named in his honour. =Cabinet positions= Later life After leaving politics, he served the province as chairman of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and later of the Commission on Election Contributions and Expenses. He returned to Queen's Park in 1973 as a liaison between Premier Davis and the Progressive Conservative caucus. Wishart was a supporter of Sault Ste. Marie's local university, Algoma University, and in 1989 a new wing was built at Algoma to house the Arthur A. Wishart Library. In 1976, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

He is most famous for discovering the Rosetta Stone, an important archaeological find that allowed Ancient Egyptian writing to be understood for the first time in centuries. Life =Early life= He was born in 1771 to Pierre Bouchard (a master joiner, then a businessman, then a merchant and finally a teacher) and his wife Pierrette Janet de Cressia, the youngest of their four daughters and three sons, all born in Orgelet (Jura). Pierre-Fran√ßois studied in the coll√®ge in Orgelet up until the classe de rh√©torique, then spent two years studying philosophy and mathematics in the coll√®ge at Besan√ßon. His military career began in 1793 as a sergeant-major in a battalion of the Grenadiers de Paris. He was one of these famous \\"soldiers of Year II' and fought in Champagne and Belgium, before being sent to the √âcole Nationale d' A√©rostatique in 1794. He was made 'lieutenant des a√©rostiers' and taught maths as sous-directeur of this √âcole, then based in the Chateau de Meudon. There his right eye was badly damaged when a gas flask exploded during an experiment to produce hydrogen gas to inflate observation balloons ‚Äì the experiment was led by Nicolas-Jacques Cont√© who lost his left eye. Cont√© held Bouchard in very high esteem and recommended him to Claude Louis Berthollet, one of the four founding fathers of the √âcole Polytechnique, which Bouchard entered on 21 November 1796. There he studied descriptive geometry under Gaspard Monge and learned the art of fortification, until his studies were interrupted when he was taken on by the Ministry of War and attached as a lieutenant to the Egyptian expeditionary force on 20 April 1798. =Egypt= The Rosetta Stone, discovered by Pierre-Fran√ßois Bouchard in July 1799Before embarking for Egypt, he married Marie √âlisabeth Bergere on 23 April 1798 ‚Äì she was a young woman from Meudon, five years his junior, with whom he much later had two children. He then went to Toulon and on 19 May the same year boarded the Franklin. He landed in Egypt on 4 July after the capture of Alexandria and was then made a member of the Commission des Sciences et des Arts. Still under Cont√©'s command, he was attached to a group of mechanical artists and ordered to investigate Egyptian crafts and techniques. He left Alexandria for Cairo on 7 September and, after a few weeks in Cairo, was on 3 October put under Antoine-Fran√ßois Andr√©ossy's command as part of a team of geographers sent to investigate Lake Menzal√© between Damietta and Port-Sa√Ød. Bouchard was only on this mission for forty days before going before the exit- panel of the √âcole Polytechnique presided over by Monge, graduating in mid November. He was then promoted to engineer lieutenant, second class on 28 November 1798 and left the Commission des Sciences et des Arts to train in the army. He was then put in charge of rebuilding of Fort Julien, an old Mameluke fortification near the port city of Rosetta (present-day Rashid) which Bonaparte had renamed after Thomas Prosper Jullien, recently assassinated in Egypt. During these works he discovered the Rosetta Stone on 15 or 19 July 1799. He was immediately convinced of its importance, an enthusiasm he passed on to generals Menou and Bonaparte. He found himself caught up in the fiasco which led to the fall of the fort of El-Arish, which he and general Cazals were defending against the Ottomans. He was sent as an envoy to the Grand Vizir but was arrested, disarmed and imprisoned in Damascus for forty-two days. On his release he was promoted to captain on 1 May 1800 and attached again to the force at Rosetta, where he was again captured when the small French garrison Fort Jullien had to capitulate to the 2,000 British and 4,000 Ottoman troops sent against them. He was released at the end of the war in Egypt and got back to Marseille on 30 July 1801. =Saint Domingue and Spain= At Marseille he joined the Saint-Domingue expedition, embarking in December accompanied by his wife, who came with him at her own expense in imitation of Pauline Bonaparte, wife of the expedition's commander Leclerc. Bouchard and his wife both caught yellow fever on the island, though she was repatriated and gave birth to their daughter in 1802, without Bouchard receiving news until much later. Bouchard was captured on the island's surrender and interned on Jamaica before being released on parole in August 1804, after which he went back to France. He convalesced there for a few months before joining Napoleon in September 1805, upon which Bouchard was put in charge of construction works in the town of Vend√©e (later renamed Roche- sur-Yon), which Napoleon had founded to reestablish civil and military authority on a civilian population who he thought might be encouraged to resume the War in the Vendee by the British naval presence in the area. Bouchard was in the town for two years with his wife, who gave birth to a son. After a brief stay in La Rochelle, in 1807 Bouchard joined an expeditionary force which Napoleon was sending against Spain and Portugal after the Treaty of Tilsitt. Bouchard then spent seven years in the Peninsular War under Dupont, Soult, Massena and Marmont, fighting bravely at the battle of Alcolea on the Guadalquivir. Even so, after Dupont's surrender at Baylen on 22 July 1808, Bouchard was yet again captured. When he was released he went to join Soult's army and was present at the battle of Corogne and the capture of Oporto, distinguishing himself at the head of the sappers in the crossing of the fortified bridge at Amarante. He was promoted to chef de bataillon on 24 November 1809, but left his wife in such great want she had to beg for an advance of 500 francs from his pay, which he had otherwise entirely devoted to buying equipment and new horses after the French pulled out of Portugal. In 1810 and 1811 he fought under Massena in a new expedition to Portugal, which once again ended in retreat. He was made a Knight of the L√©gion d'Honneur and attached to the defence of Astorga in Spain under the command of Marmont then Clauzel. There he was again captured on the city's surrender and sent to England in September 1812, leaving his children and his parents in the care of his wife, who was again impoverished now she did not have his income. =Restoration= Bouchard only got back to France after the treaty of Paris in July 1814 and the Bourbon Restoration saw him made an Officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur, a knight of the order of Saint Louis and chief engineer of Orl√©ans. During the Hundred Days he sided with Napoleon, who put him in charge of defending Laon. He was denounced after Waterloo for this action and put on half-pay, until requesting in July 1816 that his service record be amended to play down his actions during the Hundred Days. He thus rejoined the army and was attached to the fortified cities in northern France. His classmate Prevost de Vernois recommended him for the rank of lieutenant colonel, but he died in Givet in 1822, as Engineer in Chief there, after a long and painful illness ‚Äì his daughter died just before him, aged 13. His widow's friends convinced the king to accord her a 450 franc pension, only a quarter of the pension Bouchard himself had received.

The Danish pharmaceutical company, Lundbeck, owns the worldwide rights to Desmoteplase. In 2009, two large trials (DIAS-3 and DIAS-4) were started to test it as a safe and effective treatment for patients with acute ischaemic stroke. After disappointing results in DIAS-3, DIAS-4 was terminated, and in December 2014 Lundbeck announced that they would stop the development of desmoteplase. Mode of action Desmoteplase, a chemical found in the saliva of vampire bats, has the effect of catalysing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which is the enzyme responsible for breaking down fibrin blood clots. Discovery of desmoteplase As early as in 1932, the saliva of the vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) was known to lead to interference with the haemostatic mechanism of the host animal. In 1991, the DNA coding of four plasminogen activators present in the saliva of the vampire bat was completed. Of the four, recombinant D. rotundus salivary plasminogen activator alpha 1 (rDSPAŒ±1; desmoteplase) was investigated further. Chemical structure The structure of desmoteplase is similar to rt-PA (alteplase), but it does not contain the plasmin-sensitive cleavage site and the lysine-binding Kringle 2 domain. As a result, desmoteplase, in comparison to rt-PA, has high fibrin selectivity (100,000- v. 550-fold increase in catalytic activity), an absence of neurotoxicity, and no apparent negative effect on the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Desmoteplase also has a half-life of about four hours; rtPA has a terminal plasma half-life of about 5 minutes. Desmoteplase in acute ischaemic stroke clinical trial program The two phase II trials DIAS and DEDAS indicated that when intravenous (IV) desmoteplase was administered three to 9 hours after onset of ischaemic stroke symptoms, it was associated with a high rate of reperfusion and a low rate of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage at doses up to 125 Œºg/kg. In the subsequent DIAS-2 trial, the same benefit could not be shown. This could be explained by the inclusion of a substantial number of patients with a mild stroke at baseline and small mismatch volumes associated with no vessel occlusion. Post hoc analyses of the DIAS-2 data and the pooled data of the DIAS, DEDAS and DIAS-2 data showed that patients who had a proximal cerebral vessel occlusion or high-grade stenosis on baseline angiography, had a positive response for desmoteplase. In 2009, the DIAS-3 and DIAS-4 phase III trials started, each planning to enroll 400 patients worldwide who had had an acute ischaemic stroke. Participants are treated with desmoteplase as an intravenous bolus dose of 90 Œºg/kg within three to 9 hours after stroke symptom onset. Patients are selected with occlusion or high-grade stenosis (TIMI 0-1) in proximal cerebral arteries as assessed by magnetic resonance or computed tomography angiography. Wherever possible, additional perfusion-weighted imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging assessments will be done. The outcomes of DIAS-3 and DIAS-4 studies should tell whether desmoteplase is a breakthrough treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. In June 2014, Lundbeck published a press release about the DIAS-3 study revealing neutral results in an intention-to-treat analysis.http://investor.lundbeck.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=856865 The proportion of patients presenting good clinical outcome was comparable in the desmoteplase group (51.3%) and in the placebo group (49.8%). Notably, Lundbeck mentioned that, when analysing per protocol, desmoteplase showed an effect relative to placebo. Publication of the final results is still awaited. After the disappointing results in DIAS-3, the DIAS-4 trial was terminated. In December 2014 Lundbeck announced they would stop the development of desmoteplase and the company made a write-down of 309 million Danish crowns. Significance of the time window Current standards of treatment allow for IV rt-PA up to 4.5 hours in ischaemic stroke. After this time window, the benefit is typically thought to be outweighed by the risk of brain haemorrhage. Interarterial approaches are thought to be useful up to six hours. Nevertheless, CT-perfusion scans and MRI-perfusion versus MRI-diffusion demonstrate that even after six hours a significant ischaemic penumbra of brain tissue may be salvageable. Some approaches to this involves mechanical removal of clot (for example the Merci device, the penumbra device and removable stents like Solitaire). If desmoteplase can extend the IV treatment window to 9 hours, this would allow a much larger percentage of ischaemic stroke patients to receive active thrombolytic treatment ‚Äì including patients who were delayed in getting to the hospital and neurological assessment. This could make a substantial difference in stroke outcomes. A 9-hour treatment window could also have a major impact on the treatment of \\"wake-up\\" strokes - where a patient awoke with symptoms, and is not sure whether the stroke occurred within the past 4.5 hours.

The critically acclaimed series is often referred to as a visually explicit yet humorous and thought- provoking portrayal of the Buddha's life; the series itself has become a staple text in Buddhist temples for young adults and teens to learn about the Buddha‚Äôs life. The series began in September 1972 and ended in December 1983, as one of Tezuka's last epic manga works. Buddha received the 2004 and 2005 Eisner Award. As of early 2006, each volume had sold an average of 8,500 copies, with the first volume, Kapilavastu, having sold 20,000 copies. Due to differences between the ways in which Japanese and English are read, the American volumes published by Vertical Inc. are presented as mirror images of Tezuka's original work so they can be read from left to right, rather than from right to left. Nearly three decades after the manga was completed, an anime film adaptation was released in 2011. A second film was released in 2014. Plot In ancient India, the lives of many people are plagued by drought, famine, constant warfare and injustices in the caste system. The intertwining lives of many unhappy souls are drawn together by the birth of the young prince Siddhartha, who embarks on a spiritual journey, and becomes Gautama Buddha, \\"the Enlightened One\\", and attempts to bring about a spiritual rebirth of the people in this desperate age. Characters * Siddhartha Gautama (Sakyamuni Buddha): The main character of the Buddha series and prince of the Shakya tribe. He is born midway into book 1, shortly after his birth his mother dies. The first book mentions omens that seemed to symbolize Siddhartha's future. In book 2, he is a child growing bored of the privileged life of a prince. He leaves the palace towards the end of the book to become a monk. In book 3, he is a struggling monk. In book 4, after many trials in the Forest of Uruvela, Buddha achieves enlightenment. He continues to teach his disciples and inspire others until his death in book 8. * Chapra: A fictional character from the lower Shudra caste who decides to make a better life for himself. After saving the life of a well-known Kosalan general, Chapra is adopted by him as his own son, under the belief that Chapra is a Kshatriya warrior orphan. After growing up, Chapra's true heritage is revealed when his mother shows up, resulting in conflict for Chapra. Chapra eventually decides to escape with her after the truth of his caste is revealed and the two are killed by Kosalan soldiers. * Princess Yashodara: A beautiful princess who loved Siddhartha and is also the latter's cousin. He married her against his will, and together they had a son named RƒÅhula. Siddhartha left on the day Rahula was born. * Bandaka: An arrogant archer who appears in book 1 and 2. He was in love with Yashodara and fought Buddha for her hand in marriage. After Buddha left to pursue enlightenment, Bandaka convinced Buddha's father to name him heir to the Shakyan but still failed to win Yashodara over. He then resigns himself to taking a plump noblewoman as his wife, fathering Devadatta, and is later killed while fighting the invading Kosalan army. * Prasennajit: The ruler of Kosala. He married a slave from Kapilavastu, tricked to think she was a Kshatriya, and takes over Kapilavastu when he finds out the truth. When he objects to his son Virudhaka releasing Kapilavatsu, Virudhaka imprisons his father, claiming he is mentally unfit to rule. In his cell, Prasentnajit gradually wanes physically and mentally until Buddha convinces his son to release him. He dies shortly afterward, reduced to a mere beggar. * Virudhaka: Prasentnajit's son. After learning of his mother's true caste, he ostracizes her to the slave quarters and later orders her to be killed with the other slaves when plague breaks out among them. For tricking his father, Virudhaka begins a gradual extermination of Buddha's tribe until Buddha shows him that all he's accomplished is to increase the suffering he already felt. He is sometimes called Prince Crystal due to the Lapis Lazuli set in his forehead. * Bimbisara: The king of Magadha, whom Asaji prophesies will be killed by his son. This torments Bimbisara all his life. Drugged by Devadatta, Bimbisara is overthrown by his son Ajasattu and locked in the same tower he jailed his son in for attempting to kill Buddha where he gradually starves to death. On his death bed, Bimbisara meets Buddha one more time and asks Buddha to save his son. In his final hours, he regrets not showing his son more affection, instead consumed by paranoia that his son would kill him as prophesied. * Prince Ajasattu: Bimbisara's son, who is imprisoned in book 6 because he shot and almost killed Buddha with an arrow. He falls in love with a blue-eyed blonde slave named Yudelka, and vows revenge on his father when she is murdered. Ajasattu, with the help of Devadatta, overthrows his father. The guilt causes him to have a malignant tumor, which Buddha cures. In doing so, Buddha sees him smile for the first time, and pronounces \\"It's in the heart of man... that God exists.\\" * Tatta: A fictional thief of the 'Pariah', making his status even lower than that of the slave caste. As a child, Tatta is very close to nature and has the unique ability to possess animals, which the Brahmin Naradatta takes great advantage of. In volume 1, after befriending the slave Chapra, his mother and sister are murdered by the rampaging armies of Kosala. After Kosala's soldiers execute Chapra and 'Moms', Tatta vows revenge upon the kingdom of Kosala. As he grows up, Tatta becomes a bandit and reveals his plan of vengeance is to show the outside world to the sheltered child, Siddhartha, in hopes of persuading him to vanquish Kosala when he becomes king. In book 3, he agrees to stop being a bandit. In book 5, he becomes a lay disciple to Buddha, unwilling to become a monk because it would mean cutting his hair. Despite Buddha's attempts to convince him otherwise, Tatta is unable to forgive the Kosalans for killing those close to him and joins a renegade Shakyan army who sought revenge for the atrocities inflicted on them by Crystal Prince. He dies in the last book fighting the Kosalan army. * Migaila: A bandit whom Buddha falls in love with in book 2. Her eyes are burnt out on order from Buddha's father for scheming to marry him which leaves her blind for the rest of the series however she is able to \\"see\\" the world mysteriously. After a stillbirth, she becomes fatally ill with a total body rash, that leaves her terrifying to look at. Siddartha saves her life with Tatta by sucking the poison out with their mouths. She is Tatta's wife, and they have one son in book 4, a stillborn, and triplets, introduced in book 7. * Dhepa: A samanna (a non-Brahmin monk), whose philosophy is that humans were meant to suffer. He burns out one of his eyes to join Tatta and Migaila. Buddha befriends Dhepa in book 3, but the two part ways when Buddha decides against Dhepa's lifestyle. Despite ridiculing Buddha's teachings and even attempting to kill him at one point, Buddha saves Dhepa's life in book 5 whereupon Dhepa becomes his disciple. * Asaji: In volume 3, Siddhartha and Dhepa are sheltered by a huntsman and his family. In return, the huntsman asks the monks if his infant son, Asaji, can join them on their travels. Judging Asaji by his dimwitted look and runny nose, Dhepa and Siddhartha refuse, attempting to flee from Asaji by any means necessary. When Asaji catches a fever after pursuing the monks through the monsoon season, Siddhartha is determined to save him. Siddhartha cures Asaji by sucking the poisonous pus from his body. Meanwhile, the unconscious Asaji encounters a god in a vision that tells him in ten years time he will be devoured by beasts in payment for his father's meaningless hunting. As time passes, when Siddhartha is separated from the other monks, Asaji successfully and precisely predicts natural disasters. His predictions are a gift from a god. Eventually, he is brought forth before King Bimbisara and prophesies his fate and that of many other palace nobles. When Siddhartha undertakes the trials of the forest, he is astounded that Asaji is completely fearless of his gruesome destiny. When the moment of truth arrives, Asaji approaches a litter of starving wolf-cubs and sacrifices himself to the ferocious parents that tear him apart, much to Siddhartha's horror. * Devadatta: One of Buddha's first disciples. The son of Bandaka, Devadatta had a difficult childhood. As a child, he is forced to flee from Kapilavastu and meets Naradatta, learning to live with animals. When he returns to civilization, he is exploited by others to gain power, and sees a powerless old woman die. As a result, he resolves \\"I'll be a strong human, the strongest alive!\\" He met Tatta when looking for a warrior, and through Tatta, Devadatta met the Buddha. He leaves the sect when he is not chosen to be Buddha's successor and attempts to form his own sect by stealing Buddha's followers. When that fails Devadatta plots to kill Buddha; first by dropping a boulder on him, then by having an elephant stampede him. When his initial attempts fail, Devadatta poisons his nails but accidentally injures himself with them when he trips. In his final moments, he reveals that he hated the Buddha because he wanted to be just like him but couldn't. * Visakha: Visakha is the leader of a town suffering from a plague, which took her parents' lives. She is betrothed to Sukanda, a knight tasked with guarding the city. She meets Siddartha for the first time, when he and Dhepa rest in the town to save Asaji from a nearly fatal illness. She falls in love with him and tries to keep him in her city. Tatta, along with his bandits, then invade the town, rescuing Siddartha, and taking Viskha with them. The bandits also burn the town. Sukanda, comes to rescue her, but realizing she does not love him, commits suicide. Siddartha, Tatta, and Visakha part ways. Years later, Siddartha comes upon the remains of the town and meets Visakha again. She is the only resident of the town and is addicted to hallucinatory potions. Siddartha rescues her; when she eventually sobers, she becomes a disciple. * Sujata: Sujata first meets Siddartha as a young girl. She saves his life by feeding him, when he nearly starves from fasting during an ordeal. Later she saves him yet again, having fallen in love with him. She's eventually bitten by a cobra. Siddartha saves her life by pulling a soul back into her body, with instruction from Brahman. This is also the first time we see the recurring visual motif of interconnected souls * Ananda: Ananda is the half- brother of Devadetta as mentioned briefly in book 3. A former criminal who becomes one of Buddha's major disciples. The devil Mara protected him after Ananda's father offered him in exchange for sparing his life. Following his mother's murder, Ananda seeks revenge on all humanity until Buddha saved his life. Ananda then becomes Buddha's personal attendant and companion although visions of hell and death continue to haunt him. * Lata: A pretty former slave with whom Ananda falls in love. She has difficulty speaking. Lata cuts off her hair to achieve enlightenment. She dies after receiving a snake bite meant for Buddha in book 7. * Angulimala: A ruthless killer who works with Ananda and tries to kill Buddha. He is known to wear the fingers of his victims as a necklace around his neck. He ends up changing his ways thanks to Buddha's guidance. * Naradatta: A monk who is turned into an animal for forty years as punishment for killing several animals in order to save one human. He becomes a mentor for Devadatta. Naradatta dies in the last book, moments after he is forgiven for his murder and returned to his human state. * Yatala: A twenty- foot giant. The son of a slave who studied herbs and plants, Yatala's father gave him a potion that would make him grow to be powerful and invincible. His parents were killed shortly after he received the potion which caused him to grow twenty feet high by adulthood. Yatala then killed the elephant that killed his parents and wandered off, killing livestock and terrorizing villages. Many tried to kill him unsuccessfully, including a person with a bazooka. Finally, Virudhaka, or Prince Crystal, tamed him by offering him a position within the Kosalan palace guard. However, Yatala was angered by how Virudhaka abused his mother simply because of her caste and escaped whereupon he met Buddha who shows him how Virudhaka is suffering as well. He later went to work for the Kinga of Magadha before shaving his head and becoming Buddha's disciple. * Master Asita: Naradatta's master. He appears in the first book briefly and sends Naradatta to find a man with the power to save the world. He later goes to the baby prince Siddharta and gives him blessings from Brahma and Indra. He later curses Naradatta for killing several animals to save the life of one human. He was also shown to have siddhis * Brahman: Supreme universal Spirit. Appearing frequently to Buddha as a wizened old man, Brahman sets Siddhartha on the path to seeking a solution to suffering. After Buddha obtained enlightenment, Brahman bestowed him with the title of Buddha. After the Buddha died in book 8, Brahman personally escorted the Buddha to the afterlife where he promised to reveal what awaited those who pass into death. Themes *Pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda: The interconnectedness of life is highlighted first, in Master Asita's story of his master, Gosala, being saved by animals. In the story, a rabbit immolates itself to save his life. Later on, Assaji similarly sacrifices himself to be consumed by a pack of starving baby wolves. *Impermanence: Throughout the story, characters go through many ups and down - kings are imprisoned by their own sons, murderers become holy men, and numerous characters die, emphasizing the impermanence of life.

History In 1982, Erlend Antonsen and Terje Storli played at local clubs in and around Trondheim. In need of a guitarist they called on Torstein Flakne, who by then had finished playing in The Kids (a popular teeny-band in Norway 1980-82). Throughout the summer and fall of 1982 the newly formed band started rehearsing and playing shows in the region. The trio took the name Stage Dolls in January 1983. The first album, titled Soldier's Gun, was released in late 1985, after a successful nationwide tour in Norway supporting the Norwegian band TNT. Antonsen left the band in 1985 and was replaced by Steinar Krokstad; he in turn left in 1993 and was replaced by Morten Skogstad. The recordings for their next album Commandos started in late 1985. It peaked at number 8 in the Norwegian charts (VG) and set the band up as one of the most popular rockbands in Norway in 1986. The album was released in the US by Big Time Records and the title track \\"Commandos\\" gained considerable airplay on college-radio. The self-titled third album was released in 1988. It made it to number 3 at the charts in Norway, and at the single \\"Wings of Steel\\" went to number 10. In 1989, the band released the album on Chrysalis Records for the American market. The single \\"Love Cries\\" went to number 46 on the Billboard Singles Charts the same year. A second single for the song \\"Still in Love\\" was also released in America. In 1991, the band released a fourth album called Stripped. The album went to number 5 in Norway, and the single \\"Love Don't Bother Me\\" charted at number 3. The music video for the song, featured English model Kate Moss.

Early years Born in Bremen, Cato was the eldest of three children. She spent her childhood and youth in the nearby Fischerhude artists' colony around her uncle Otto Modersohn. Her parents, the Dutch-born potter Jan Bontjes van Beek (1899-1969) and dancer and painter Olga Bontjes van Beek, n√©e Breling (1896-1995) offered their children a lot of personal freedom while growing up. From 1929, Cato stayed abroad to attend the German school in Amsterdam, and in 1937, she spent time in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, as an au pair. Unlike many others Cato did not join the League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher M√§del, BDM) youth organisation. Through her brother Tim, she met Luftwaffe Sergeant Helmut Schmidt, the future Chancellor of Germany, who from 1937 was stationed in Bremen-Vegesack for his military service and during this time had an intense friendship with the Bontjes van Beek family. However, Schmidt eventually broke off this friendship when he began an officers' training in order to join the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe in Berlin. From 1940 on, Cato and her sister Mietje lived with their father in Berlin, where he had already moved in 1933 in the hopes of spreading his artistic work. They met friends at their father's house who opposed the Nazi regime. Cato, though, struggled to choose a profession and attempted to become a pilot. This even included joining the National Socialist Flyers Corps to learn gliding. However, Cato eventually decided to learn her father's craft. In 1940, Cato experienced the deportation of a Jewish family who lived in the same house. In a letter to her aunt, she then expressed her worries about \\"something terrible\\" to come. Both sisters saw the wrong that the Nazis inflicted upon others, were affected by it, and tried to help. Beginning in September 1940, this included giving humanitarian aid to French prisoners of war. Both Cato and Mietje would hand out bread or exchange letters with them while riding the Berlin S-Bahn.Landesentrale f√ºr politische Bidung Baden-W√ºrttemberg (2013), Cato Bontjes van Beek - Als junge Frau im Widerstand Resistance activities Cato Bontjes van Beek memorial, Fischerhude cemetery Van Beek's active work against the Nazis began in the Red Orchestra resistance organization after she had gotten to know Libertas Schulze-Boysen in autumn 1941.

On 18 January 1943, she was found guilty at the Reichskriegsgericht military court of \\"abetting a conspiracy to commit high treason\\" and sentenced to death.

The novel won the 2006 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize and the 2007 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Young Adult Fiction. Setting The book is set six months after Infernal Devices. Wren Natsworthy and her father Tom Natsworthy have taken to the skies in their airship, the Jenny Haniver. After the apparent death of the Stalker Fang at the end of Infernal Devices, General Naga has seized command of the Green Storm and has signed a peace treaty between the Green Storm and the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft, ushering in a new era of peace and trade. Whilst Wren is enjoying life as an aviator, Tom misses Hester, and has been informed by a doctor that his weak heart means he only has a few years left to live. The Lost Boy, Fishcake, is secretly repairing the Stalker Fang, coming to regard her as the mother he never had. Theo Ngoni has returned to Zagwa and rejoined his family. Explanation of the novel's title The title is derived from Matthew Arnold's poem Dover Beach. This excerpt of the poem appears at the beginning of the book: This relates to the novel in several ways. The characters are indeed swept about, often against their will, by the \\"ignorant armies\\" of the Green Storm and Traktionstadtsgesellschaft, on the \\"darkling plain\\" of the Great Hunting Ground. Reeve references his choice of title himself towards the end of the book when the character Nimrod Pennyroyal writes a book within a book titled Ignorant Armies. The similarly titled, \\"As on a Darkling Plain\\", by Ben Bova in 1972 also takes its title from this poem. Plot = Part One = Six months after the events of Infernal Devices, General Naga, the now-leader of the Green Storm after the supposed demise of the Stalker Fang, has formed a truce with the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft, blossoming a new era of trade and peace. Theo Ngoni, returning to his home of Zagwa and reuniting with his family, foils an assassination attempt on Oenone Zero, who is married to General Naga and has taken the title of Lady Naga. Zero was in Zagwa to facilitate peace terms with Zagwa and the Green Storm; and suspects that the attempt was made by Green Storm soldiers still loyal to the Stalker Fang. Due to the possibility of another attempt, Zero has an incognito merchant airship prepared that will take her an alternate route to Naga. As Theo saved her life, Zero wants him to accompany her; Theo agrees, hopeful that he might meet Wren. En route, Zero's servant Rohini is revealed to be Cynthia Twite, a Green Storm spy who survived the events of Infernal Devices, and attempts to kill her, but Theo intervenes. Cynthia escapes and downs the airship. The pair survive the crash, but Zero is captured by air- trader Napster Varley who plans to sell her to the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft; whilst Theo is saved from slavers by Hester Shaw and the Stalker Shrike, who is unable to kill due to Zero's tampering. After Theo informs them of Zero's capture, Hester and Shrike decide to find her, as Zero will be able to reverse Shrike's \\"barrier\\" she implemented. Cynthia reaches Naga's base in Tienjing and lies to him that Zero was killed by the Zagwans, though Naga refuses to take action against Tractionists. Cynthia manages to weasle her way to serve in Naga's household. In the Traction City of Peripatetiapolis, Tom Natsworthy discovers that the bullet that Nimrod Pennyroyal shot him with in Predator's Gold has damaged his heart and he has not long to live, though he doesn't tell his daughter Wren. Tom soon discovers a woman that resembles Clytie Potts, a London Apprentice Historian that he knew. When questioned, she tells him that her name is Cruwys Morchard and that she is transporting Old-Tech devices. Unconvinced, Tom and Wren decide to pursue her, travelling on the Jenny Haniver to Murnau, a Traktionstadtsgesellschaft city, where they meet Wolf von Kobold, the son of the Mayor of Murnau and commander of the traction city Harrowbarrow. Wolf believes that the survivors of MEDUSA may be still inside London, and the three agree to make an expedition to London. Tom and Wren meet Wolf on Harrowbarrow, a burrowing Traction City, which takes them closer to London. With Wolf accompanying them, they fly the Jenny Haniver over the Green Storm border, and finally reaching the debris field of London. There they discover that the survivors of MEDUSA have rebuilt a society in London, led by Tom's old boss and now Mayor Chudleigh Pomeroy. Garamond, the paranoid head of security, convinces Pomeroy to keep them there as he suspects that they may inform others of London's survival. Tom, Wren and Wolf eventually discover a new traction town being rebuilt near the ruins, a project that was in-progress long before Magnus Crome decided to use MEDUSA. Noticing that \\"New London\\" has no wheels, the leading Engineer Dr. Childermass explains that it uses Magnetic Levitation to float above the ground, making it less harmful to the environment. Wolf slips away from the conversation and escapes back to Harrowbarrow, intent on devouring New London and to use the technology to make his city better. Meanwhile, the former Lost Boy Fishcake has partially rebuilt the Stalker Fang in Cairo. The Stalker Fang often malfunctions, alternating in personality between the kind and supportive Anna-side and the cold and merciless Stalker-side. Fishcake informs Fang that Cairo is stopping to trade with Lost Boy-ruled Brighton where they steal a limpet and make their way to the state of Shan Guo, where the Stalker will do something \\"important\\". Walking the rest of the way by foot, Fishcake and Fang stops at a hermitage, that is inhabited by Sathya, an exiled commander of the Green Storm and an old friend to Anna. The Anna-side of the Stalker doesn't wish to harm Sathya, and wants former London Engineer Dr. Popjoy, who resurrected her in Predator‚Äôs Gold to eliminate the Stalker-side. Despite protestations, Fishcake accompanies her to Batmunkh Gompa. However, before meeting Popjoy, the Stalker-side returns and demands that he remove the Anna-side. Popjoy explains to her that the brain he fitted her with in Rogue's Roost was from a much older model he found in the Arctic and that it was from a \\"Remembering Machine\\" that helped to keep a nomad culture alive. When Popjoy discovers that the Stalker Fang will reactivate ODIN (standing for Orbital Defence Initiative), an orbital weapon with firepower similar to MEDUSA, he protests; but the Stalker kills him. The Stalker Fang takes Fishcake with her to Erdene Tezh, her old home. =Part Two= Napster Varley arrives in Airhaven, which is floating above the Traktionstadtgesellschaft, and unsuccessfully attempts to sell Zero to Wolf's father Kriegsmarschall von Kobold. Hester, Theo and Shrike arrive at the floating city and attempt to buy her from Varley, who asks for an extortionate price which they cannot pay. Hester and Theo discover Pennyroyal hiding in Airhaven in disgrace and debt after a newspaper exposed him as a fraud. Hester takes what remains of his money and heads to Varley's ship to buy Zero, with Theo accidentally mentioning to Pennyroyal about Zero being alive. With this knowledge and seeking to reclaim fame, Pennyroyal rounds up men from Manchester and marches to Varley's ship. Discovering a photograph of Zero that Varley placed on him, von Kobold attempts to rescue her to make further peace with Naga. Hester's attempt to cheat Varley is discovered and he attacks her, but his abused wife kills him. As Hester and Zero make their way back, von Kobold finds them and helps them. Pennyroyal arrives with the Manchester men and a fight ensues where von Kobold is shot, but survives via his Old-Tech armour. Shrike manages to scare them away and gets Hester and Zero to their airship the Shadow Aspect and escape. Pennyroyal gets into an altercation with a journalist and falls from Airhaven and is assumed dead, but lands in the rigging of the Shadow Aspect. Stalker-birds arrive but escort the airship to a Green Storm air base where they are hailed as heroes. The base is soon attacked by the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft and Harrowbarrow. All escape in an airship heading east except Theo who stays behind to retrieve a letter that Wren sent him, but is seemingly killed by a bomb shell. Wolf returns to Harrowbarrow and meets with von Kobold and the Mayor of Manchester Adlai Browne. With support from other Traktionstadtsgesellschaft cities, Browne intends to destroy the Green Storm, despite von Kobold wanting peace. In Tienjing, Naga is informed of the Green Storm air base being attacked but does nothing, disheartened by Zero's supposed death. Cynthia has been poisoning his green tea to make him helpless further and fanatically believes that the Stalker Fang will return. Fishcake and the Stalker Fang, whose personalities seem to be merged, steal Popjoy's air yacht and reach Erdene Tezh and her old home. Inside, she starts to create a device which will relay orders to ODIN. =Part Three= Theo survives the attack on the airfield and treks east across the plains toward London, where Wren's letter told him she would be; whilst the surviving Green Storm soldiers are transported off to Forward Command, an old traction city where Hester, Shrike and Zero were taken. Theo eventually reaches New London and is reunited with Wren, as well as warning the residents that the war between the Green Storm and the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft has restarted. ODIN is fired upon Manchester and other cities by the Stalker Fang, killing Browne. Orla Twombley, a pilot formerly from Brighton, observes the destruction and reports to von Kobold in Murnau, telling him and the remaining cities to retreat from a Green Storm weapon. Naga receives communication that Zero is alive, and, realising that Twite has deceived him confronts her. Twite attempts to kill him, but ODIN fires on Tienjing. Naga survives but Twite is killed instantly in the blast. The residents of New London see the firepower of ODIN from afar, and fearing that it is a Green Storm weapon, make plans to head north when the city is finished. Tom, fearing for Wren, takes the Jenny Haniver to Tienjing, hoping to convince Naga to not use his supposed weapon. Tom leaves a letter to Wren saying his goodbyes and entrusting Theo to take care for her, admitting that he is dying. Wolf hears of Manchester's destruction and is determined to continue on to London, claiming to his underlings that Harrowbarrow's creeping nature will help them survive. =Part Four= Hester, Shrike, Zero and Pennyroyal make their way to Batmunkh Gompa to reunite with Naga, who has been evacuated to there. They are told of the destruction of traction cities and Tienjing alike, which Shrike deduces is the work of the Stalker Fang. Zero intends to talk to Popjoy as he built the Stalker Fang and may know how to disable her for good. Wren discovers Tom's letter and attempts to follow him with Theo, but they are stopped by Garamond, who believes they are Green Storm agents and are escaping to betray New London. It is revealed that Pomeroy had died in his sleep when Tom left New London and Garamond has taken his place. Garamond arrests the pair, but Childermass frees them and tells them to escape to a Green Storm settlement. It is revealed that Childermass is the mother of Bevis Pod. Tom, flying the Jenny Haniver, is intercepted on his way to Tienjing and brought to Batmunkh Gompa, where he is interrogated by Naga. Tom pleads for Naga to not use the weapon on New London, but Naga mistakes him for a Traktionstadtsgesellschaft spy and disbelieves him. Hester and the others arrive in Batmunkh Gompa, where Zero discovers Popjoy is dead. When Zero meets with Naga, he accuses her of being a spy, believing that London is the master of the new weapon and that Popjoy faked his death to join them. Naga has Zero beaten and detained, then orders for their forces to attack London. Pennyroyal informs Hester and Shrike of Zero's predicament, and Hester is shakily reunited with Tom, who tells her that Theo is alive and with Wren in London. With Shrike, the pair escape on the Jenny Haniver. The Stalker Fang targets Zhan Shan, a volcano, with ODIN, triggering an eruption that will last for weeks and destroy many provinces. Tom and Hester deduce that the Stalker Fang has gone to Erdene Tezh and fly the Jenny Haniver there. Wren and Theo hear Harrowbarrow approaching to devour New London. Wren boards it whilst Theo warns the Londoners of the approaching city. Wren confronts Wolf, and tricks him into diverting Harrowbarrow into an area that is full of energy left from MEDUSA. The Green Storm arrives and attacks, though Wolf continues ahead, having dealt with the Green Storm before, but Harrowbarrow is damaged by MEDUSA's left-over energy. Theo boards it and finds Wren, but Harrowbarrow starts moving again. Naga, informed of Harrowbarrow's approach, realises his error and defends New London, which finally begins to move, with Harrowbarrow in pursuit. Wolf confronts Wren and Theo on Harrowbarrow's back, but Wren accidentally kills Wolf when Naga's airship arrives and rescues them. Naga drops Wren and Theo on New London and pilots his airship straight into Harrowbarrow in a kamikaze attack, destroying the city and allowing New London to escape. On board the Jenny Haniver, Shrike finds Pennyroyal hiding, and the three tie him up. Stalker-birds attack the airship, severely damaging it. Shrike manages to save the three from being killed, but falls out of the ship and into the mountains. The airship downs near Fang's old home, where Hester and Tom leave Pennyroyal. Fishcake, having heard the airship, confronts them and tries to kill Hester, but is stopped by the Stalker Fang. Fishcake demands she kills them, but the Stalker Fang hits him and Fishcake runs away. Tom's heart begins to strain and he collapses. The Stalker Fang, deciding not to kill them as they will all die soon enough, takes Tom into the house as Hester follows. The Stalker Fang explains to Tom and Hester that she destroyed various traction cities and Green Storm bases to make the two sides fight each other, giving her time to send a command to ODIN. This command targets various volcanoes around the Earth, which will erupt and kill humanity in the resulting volcanic winter, but will \\"make the world green again\\". Fishcake finds Pennyroyal, and they plan to escape in Popjoy's sky-yacht, but need the keys around the Stalker Fang's neck. Pennyroyal finds an anti-Stalker weapon that Hester dropped and makes his way toward the house. Tom attempts to convince the Anna-side of the Stalker to destroy ODIN, and the Stalker flashes between the converging personalities. Pennyroyal suddenly enters and kills the Stalker Fang, which falls onto the ODIN transmitter and destroys it. Tom's heart strains and he collapses again, whilst Pennyroyal takes the key to the sky-yacht and attempt to bring it to them to save Tom. As Hester takes Tom outside, they see a twinkling star in the sky, and Hester realises that the Stalker Fang had ordered ODIN to destroy itself. Pennyroyal attempts to fly the sky-yacht to Tom and Hester, but is threatened by Fishcake to leave them behind as revenge for leaving him on Brighton. Hester watches the sky-yacht fly away, and she comforts Tom as he dies. Hester commits suicide shortly afterwards. Zero is informed of Naga's demise, and is appointed leader of the Green Storm, which she reforms as the Anti-Traction League. She makes a treaty with von Kobold to cease fighting forever, with many traction cities subsequently becoming static. Popjoy's sky-yacht fails outside Batmunkh Gompa, and Fishcake abandons Pennyroyal, who travels back to Murnau and spends time in debtors' prison before writing a truthful account of the events he survived, titling it Ignorant Armies. However, it is never published due to his fraudulent activities, and Pennyroyal lives out the rest of his life in Peripatetiapolis with an old girlfriend. Fishcake makes his way to Sathya's hermitage, where he lives with her into adulthood and has children of his own. He comes to regret leaving Hester and Tom in Erdene Tezh, though he believes that they were resourceful enough to find a way to escape. Wren and Theo leave New London in the north a year later, and go to Zagwa to see Theo's family. When Airhaven arrives, Wren and Theo buy a new airship with Wolf's expedition money, calling it the Jenny Haniver II and become air-traders. New London thrives as it escapes predator cities and trades with anti-gravity furniture. Miles away, Shrike revives himself and arrives at Erdene Tezh too late, finding the remains of the Stalker Fang. Although her Stalker brain is dead, Shrike downloads memories from the older part of her brain. He then finds Tom and Hester's bodies, and considers taking Hester to be Resurrected, but decides against it when he sees that they held hands when they died. As he takes their bodies, Shrike recalls his own long-lost memories of his own two children (Ruan and Fern from Fever Crumb) before he was turned into a Stalker. Laying the bodies down in an outcrop nearby, Shrike shuts down and watches their bodies decompose over the years. As the years flash by him, an oak tree grows from Hester's body, and he eventually slows this time lapse when he notices human figures nearby. Finally out of his fugue state, Shrike discovers that a forest has grown round him, and meets a girl and a boy. The pair take him down into a village, where Shrike finds that he was considered an old shrine statue, and the people hung flowers around his neck for luck. The Stalker discovers that the village has utilised Childermass' anti-gravity machines, and that he has woken hundreds, if not thousands of years into the future. When he asks if there are any traction cities in the world, the village people explain that they are thought to be fairy tales nowadays and find the idea ridiculous. When the people ask what he was for, Shrike responds that he is a \\"Remembering Machine\\", and is asked to tell his story. Shrike starts by speaking the first lines of Mortal Engines: > \\"It was a dark, blustery day in spring, and the City of London was chasing a > small mining town across the dried-up bed of the old North Sea...\\" References Literature * Henry Keazor: \\"'Mortal Engines' und 'Infernal Devices': Architektur- und Technologie-Nostalgie bei Philip Reeve\\", in: Techniknostalgie und Retrotechnologie, edited by Andreas B√∂hn and Kurt M√∂ser, Karlsruhe 2010, pp. 129‚Äì147 External links * Strange Horizons review * Science Fiction Weekly review (contains plot detail) * The Guardian review * Novels by Philip Reeve British young adult novels Children's science fiction novels Guardian Children's Fiction Prize-winning works British steampunk novels Post- apocalyptic novels Predator Cities 2006 British novels 2006 science fiction novels 2006 children's books ","title":"A Darkling Plain"},{"id":"2856967","text":"80-Page Giant was the name used for a series of comic books published by DC Comics beginning in 1964. The series was named for its unusually high page count. (The typical page count for American monthly comics at this time was 32 pages). The cover price was initially 25 cents, while other comics of the day were rarely above 12 cents. Many of these \\"Giant\\" issues contained reprinted material, often including material from the Golden Age era of comics. Each issue would focus upon a particular DC character or group, such as Superman, Batman, or Jimmy Olsen. The 80-Page Giant format and numbering would later be used for special extra-large, reprint-heavy issues of their regularly published titles. In the late 1990s, DC Comics began publishing 80-Page Giant specials which were special publications relating to a series (including Secret Origins, which had not been an ongoing title for years) and which were usually compilations. Around this time, DC was also publishing reprint-themed 80-Page Giant Annuals (also called \\"100 Page Spectaculars\\"), some of which were reprinted replicas of past Annuals and some of which were newly published reprint collections styled as the Annuals of a Silver Age title that had no Annuals during its actual run. Number of pages Originally, the Giant issues were all labeled 80 Page Giant. When the number of pages was decreased (usually to 64 pages), the \\"80 Page\\" part of the title was dropped and the title changed to simply Giant or DC Giant. Types of Giant comics There were four types of \\"Giant\\" comics: =Issues G1 to G15= These issues were published under the 80 Page Giant title.

In a first-class career spanning over seventeen years, he took 675 wickets and scored 4,457 runs. Life and career Williams was born in St Vincent and emigrated to Britain when he was 13. He joined Middlesex after a season-and-a- half as an MCC Young Professional during which time he had been playing for Hornsey. A deeply religious man, when he first arrived at Lord's he refused to play on Sundays. He made his county debut in 1982 as a brisk rather than fast bowler, but what he lacked in pace he made up for in accuracy and late away- swing. . He was a key part of four Championship-winning sides (1982, 1985, 1990, 1992) and in 1995, following a successful benefit, he moved to Essex where he played until 1998. He also enjoyed three seasons playing for Windward Islands and also one season with Tasmania in 1983-84. His Test call-up for the last Test of 1990 against India at The Oval came when Chris Lewis withdrew with a migraine.

The \\"triangle\\" is formed by the cities of Columbus, Starkville, and West Point but the region is often more broadly-defined to include all of Clay, Lowndes, and Oktibbeha counties and sometimes additional surrounding communities and counties as well. The term was created as a marketing strategy in the 1990s to promote economic development in the region and encourage additional cooperation between local communities in attracting investment. The three counties are home to a population of over 128,000 and 500,000 workers are within 60 miles of the region. The area's economic development potential is anchored by the presence of Mississippi State University, Columbus Air Force Base, and associated spin-off industries in research, high-tech manufacturing, aerospace, transportation, and education. GTR has attracted $5.9 billion in capital investment since 2008. The area is served by Golden Triangle Regional Airport, which is the third busiest in the state. History This area has been considered part of Mississippi's Black Belt, also called \\"Black Prairie\\", which extends throughout Mississippi and Alabama.James Fallows, \\"Heavy Industry in the Mississippi 'Prairie': Why Are These Factories Here?\\", The Atlantic, 30 May 2014; accessed 17 April 2018 Its economy was largely based on cotton production well into the 20th century. Due to planters' reliance on cotton as a commodity crop, and dependence on enslaved African-American workers before the American Civil War, African Americans constituted a majority of the population of these counties in Mississippi and Alabama before the war and after. Many stayed as freedmen to work as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Historically, Columbus was the largest city in the region and considered the anchor the Golden Triangle. Columbus was able to succeed due to historical importance as a port on the Tombigbee River that made the city attractive to industry. The presence of Columbus Air Force Base and the Mississippi University for Women also added to amenities in the city. However, industrial decline in many of the city's industries began to take hold during the 1990s. Meanwhile, rapid growth at Mississippi State University, the state's largest research university, has added to Starkville's stability and appeal. In 2012, Starkville surpassed Columbus in population to become the largest city in the region. Despite increased cooperation between the two cities in recent years, Starkville's reputation as the liberal college town contrasts with Columbus' more conservative military population. The third city, West Point, Mississippi, has always been the smallest and more vulnerable economically. It suffered the closing of a Sara Lee meat-processing plant in 2007 that cost 1000 jobs, equivalent to \\"a tenth of the town's population.\\" The local jurisdictions and counties have joined together in 2012 to support an economic development authority to recruit industry to the area. It was first called Golden Triangle Development LINK; in 2014 it became known as Golden Triangle Development Authority (GTDA). The consortium was based on an \\"annual operating budget of $2.5 million, 70 percent of which will come from public entities in the three counties that make up the Golden Triangle. The organization hopes to privately fund the remaining 30 percent via five-year agreements with area businesses.\\" Such recruiting has been successful. Since the early 21st century, several manufacturing companies have located at the Golden Triangle Industrial Park in Lowndes County, leading to a resurgence in the Columbus area. The Triangle is home to an advanced-tech steel mill developed by the Russian Severstal company, a drone plant, and a helicopter factory (Eurocopter, now known as Airbus Helicopters). Area residents say the latter helps them establish the region as one that can support highly skilled, high-tech jobs. In addition, Yokohama Tires of Japan opened a manufacturing plant in the area in 2015. From 2004‚Äì2014, the Golden Triangle region \\"brought in some $6 billion in capital investment ..., creating some 6,000 new jobs, in a concentrated, poor region where this influx has made an enormous difference.\\" See also *Megasite References Regions of Mississippi ","title":"Golden Triangle (Mississippi)"},{"id":"2856993","text":"CarMax store in Raleigh, North Carolina CarMax is America's largest used-car retailer and a Fortune 500 company. The corporate entity behind the formation of CarMax was Circuit City Stores, Inc. The first CarMax used-car store opened in September 1993, from Circuit City's corporate offices in Richmond, Virginia. As of November 30, 2018, CarMax operated 195 locations in 95 television media markets. While CarMax stores focus on marketing used vehicles, the company acquired its first new car franchise with Chrysler Corporation in 1996. By 1999, it added new vehicle franchises for Mitsubishi Motors, Toyota, and Nissan as well. As of November 2018, the only CarMax new vehicle dealerships that remain are the two Toyota stores located in Kenosha, Wisconsin and Laurel, Maryland.  Concept  The concept for CarMax was developed by Circuit City executives under then-CEO Richard L. Sharp. It was developed for nearly a year in 1991, using the code name \\"Project X\\", and was also known as \\"Honest Rick's Used Cars\\" to those intimately involved in the skunk works team. The concept was actually first proposed by Ronald L. Moore of Richmond, Virginia, a consultant hired by Circuit City to evaluate possible business opportunities beyond the scope of their consumer electronics locations. Prior to the first store being built, DeVito/Verdi was hired as the advertising agency and creative resource. The company executed the campaign and additional TV advertisements over the course of a number of years in support of the launch and the initial wave of stores. The business model began with no fees, however the model was subsequently abandoned for the current business model after it was determined that customers were not concerned about paying transaction fees for the purchase of a vehicle. A typical CarMax store is approximately , carries an inventory of 300-400 vehicles, and turns its inventory over eight to ten times a year. On average, a CarMax location employs 40 sales associates. Each car goes through a thorough 125-point inspection process, beyond any state-required inspections, and includes a 90-day warranty, three days to change your financing for free, and a seven-day money back guarantee. Circuit City issued the first CarMax stock in February 1997, when CarMax had seven locations. Initially, the stock was a tracking stock still under the umbrella of the Circuit City. CarMax officially split from Circuit City as of October 1, 2002, when it was spun off as a stock dividend for Circuit City shareholders, with shares also issued to those holding CarMax tracking stock. During the 12-month period ending February 28, 2018, the company sold 721,512 used cars at retail. According to the CarMax fiscal year 2018 report released on April 24, 2018, the company opened 15 used car superstores in Fiscal Year 2018, and expects to open 15 additional stores in Fiscal Year 2019. CarMax was on Fortune's \\"100 Best Companies to Work For\\" list from 2005 to 2018, placing 34th in 2018. In 2020, Fortune ranked CarMax at number 20 on their Fortune List of the Top 100 Companies to Work For in 2020 based on an employee survey of satisfaction.

Launched on 26 September 2003, its TV signal is transmitted with IPTV technology through HKT's fixed broadband network. It provides 197 TV channels including 176 channels branded under now TV (32 channels in HD), 21 channels from TVB Network Vision (1 channel in HD), and over 30 video on demand categories. Now TV is the largest pay-TV operator in Hong Kong in terms of number of subscribers, number of channels, number of HD channels and quantity of VOD contents. The word \\"Now\\" is abbreviated from \\"Network Of the World\\". History and establishment Launched in March 1998, PCCW's services included a wide range of information and entertainment, such as news, video-on-demand (VOD), music videos, home-shopping, home-banking and educational content. iTV had some 67,000 subscribers at the end of 2000. Due to the liberalization of the pay-TV market by the HKSAR government in early July 2000, the then existing duopolists, iTV and i-Cable, were confronted with ferocious competition. With fewer subscribers and hence the decline in the revenue generated from iTV, the interactive television operation was terminated in the final quarter of 2002. Now Broadband pay-TV service was launched in September 2003 with 23 channels under the same umbrella company PCCW; iTV is thus commonly viewed as the predecessor of Now TV. In December 2005, Now TV introduced a technology with connection speed up to 18 megabits per second (Mbit/s). At least 75% of the service area will be offered a service running up to 8Mbit/s. In addition, Video-On-Demand services were launched in January 2006. Now TV subscribers have access to 136 channels. =Chronology= *March 1998 Hong Kong Telecom commercially launched iTV *July 2000 Liberalisation of the pay-TV market *Last quarter of 2002 Termination of iTV *August 2003 Now TV was unveiled *September 2003 Now TV was officially launched =Charging schemes= Since each household has to install a special decoder to view the channels, there is an extra deposit and installation for the decoder. However, these charges are waived for Netvigator broadband subscribers. With the decoder, households are able to watch approximately 20 free channels. For the subscription channels, Now uses the pricing model of pay-per-channel basis. There are bundle offers in existence, for given bouquet of channels, but these are less comprehensive than those offered by rivals. Now TV offers a business package (in which there are fewer channels for subscription than household customers) for businesses at a higher price than household subscribers. Since 1 September 2007, Now TV no longer offers STAR Sports or ESPN as stand-alone packages, preferring instead to bundle them into a single multi-sport package. This has caused some distress amongst many viewers who view this move as a breach of their commitment contract's that stipulates that upon expiry of channel contracts, contracts are automatically renewed. Channel highlights In the beginning, Now TV only operated 23 channels, most of which were in English. In response to competition, it has expanded its repertoire of new channels, adding programming such as the Disney Channel and ESPN. By June 2005, the number of channels grew to more than 70, with an increased number of Cantonese channels. In 2006, Now TV outbid i-Cable for the rights to broadcast English Premier League football in Hong Kong, starting with the 2007-08 season. It is also the broadcaster of LaLiga, the Spanish football competition Now TV currently has the most channels of any pay TV provider in Hong Kong. At present, it offers 21 free channels and 103 pay channels, including 15 audio channels. The total number of channels exceeds 130. Languages of channels provided The majority of its programming is in English, Cantonese or Putonghua, though some programming in Hindi (Star Bharat), and French (TV5MONDE), is available. Business performance and development Now TV service was launched with 23 channels in September 2003 but was soon expanded to exceed 30 with the addition of sports-related channels and BBC World and the Animax channel, as well as the Cantonese-language Star Chinese Movies and Xing Kong channels. Within four months of launch, Now TV had attracted more than 200,000 customers by end-2003. According to a report in Ming Pao Finance on 5 October 2005, the number of subscribers to Now TV exceeded 450,000. Per annual reports issued by PCCW, at the end of December 2005 the number of paying subscribers to Now TV stood at 549,000 (approximately 61% were paid subscribers, with 31% being free subscribers). These figures compare with totals of 361,000 at end-December 2004 and 269,000 at end-June 2004. Despite the growth in subscribers, Now TV was operating at a loss in 2005. By August 2006, Now TV had in excess of 654,000 subscribers. =Strategy= In early July 2000, the HKSAR government awarded five new pay-TV licences. The new entrants were all relatively seasoned broadcasting companies including Galaxy Satellite Broadcasting, Hong Kong DTV Company, a British broadcaster Elmsdsale, Hong Kong Network TV and Pacific Digital Media HK. The opening of the market sparked intense competition for programming and viewer share. To avoid direct competition with the two local digital terrestrial channels - Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) and ViuTV - Now TV sought to build up and secure its local pay-TV position by signing long-term contracts with a variety of channels from around the world. Exclusivity *On November 15, 2006, Now TV made a knock-out bid, of an estimated HK$1.56 billion, to secure the license to exclusively broadcast football matches of the Barclays Premier League matches in Hong Kong for three seasons commencing from the 2007/2008 season.Jeffrey Tam, NOW scores English football in $1.56b bid, The Standard, November 15, 2006 Two years previously, i-Cable had paid an estimated HK$700 million for a three-year contract.Wong Ka-chun, PCCW eyes league rights with tie-up, The Standard, January 13, 2006 *Now TV announced in January 2006 that a three-year deal was signed with ESPN STAR for the rights to live matches of the UEFA Champions League during the 2006-2009 seasons. *In December 2006 secured the exclusive rights to broadcast the Euro 2008 football championship by agreeing to pay HK$400 million.Jeffrey Tam, Now TV wins Euro 2008 exclusive rights in $400m deal, The Standard, December 09, 2006 *Playboy TV will become exclusive to Now TV from December 1, 2006.

Moreover, from Asia Media in October 2005, Now TV claimed that they will not follow i-Cable to minimize monthly charges since they have added new channels and improved the delivery standard, in order to maintain competitiveness.

He was born in Valpara√≠so, where he also completed his first studies. He joined the Military Academy in 1837. He participated in the battle of Yungay, during the war against the Peru-Bolivian Confederacy, and later in the Pacification of the Araucan√≠a. During the battle of Loncomilla, in the 1851 revolution, he was injured and lost one of his arms. General Escala was already a veteran when on July 18, 1879, during the War of the Pacific, was called by Domingo Santa Mar√≠a, principal minister of President An√≠bal Pinto, to assume command of the army in replacement of General Justo Arteaga, who had just resigned due to political in-fighting. Santa Maria chose him because a popular soldier was wanted at the head of the army. More to the point, Santa Maria also wanted someone who would be malleable and pliant to his direction. Someone, in brief, that would not hinder his future presidential candidacy. But contrary to expectations, General Escala, due to his quick temperament, soon got into a feud with the brothers Sotomayor: Rafael Sotomayor was Minister of War and Marine and organizer of the Army, and his brother, Colonel Emilio Sotomayor, was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. The conflict intensified because General Escala did not approve of any \\"civilian\\" interference in what he saw as purely army matters. He also wanted to reorganize the army along the lines of the one used on the Arauco conflict. The minister, on the other hand, wanted to structure it in divisions and brigades. In spite of the political collisions, during his command the Chilean forces defeated the Peruvians at Pisagua, Dolores and Los Angeles. Finally the conflict with the minister of war was resolved by the resignation of General Escala on March 28, 1880. In his letter of resignation, he mentioned \\"...the criminal insults inflicted by Mr. Rafael Sotomayor to his rights and his dignity\\". General Escala's resignation left the army in a very vulnerable situation. The soldiers' morale was at a low ebb, being engaged in disputes, gossip and internal rivalries. To solve the problem, the minister Rafael Sotomayor appointed General Manuel Baquedano as commander-in-chief, saying \\"...where Baquedano goes, gossip does not follow\\". General Escala returned to Chile, where he died in Santiago, in 1884, in relative obscurity.

The T≈çseiha or ' was a political faction in the Imperial Japanese Army active in the 1920s and 1930s. The T≈çseiha was a grouping of moderate officers united primarily by their opposition to the radical K≈çd≈çha (Imperial Way) faction and its aggressive expansionistic and anti-modernization ideals. The T≈çseiha rivaled the K≈çd≈çha for influence in the army until the February 26 Incident in 1936, when the K≈çd≈çha was de facto dissolved and many supporters were disciplined or executed. The T≈çseiha became the primary influence in the army, but the K≈çd≈çha ideology and its supporters continued to influence Japanese militarism into the late 1930s.  Background  The Empire of Japan had enjoyed economic growth during The First World War but this ended in the early 1920s with the Sh≈çwa financial crisis. Social unrest increased with the growing polarization of society and inequalities, with the labor unions increasingly influenced by socialism, communism and anarchism, but the industrial and financial leaders of Japan continued to get wealthier through their inside connections with politicians and bureaucrats. The military was considered \\"clean\\" in terms of political corruption, and elements within the army were determined to take direct action to eliminate the perceived threats to Japan created by the weaknesses of liberal democracy and political corruption. Hideki T≈çj≈ç, the Prime Minister of Japan during much of World War II, was a member of the T≈çseiha. An ultranationalist faction within the army called the K≈çd≈çha (Imperial Way) was formed by General Sadao Araki and his prot√©g√©, Jinzabur≈ç Masaki, who envisioned a return to an idealized pre-industrialized, pre- westernized Japan. The T≈çseiha formed in reaction to the radical K≈çd≈çha and attempted to represent the more conservative and moderate elements within the army. The T≈çseiha and K≈çd≈çha both adopted ideas from totalitarian and fascist political philosophies, and shared the fundamental ideals that national defense must be strengthened through a reform of national politics and espoused a strong skepticism for political party politics and representative democracy. Although the factions shared key ideals, opposition was based on how to achieve them. Opposition The T≈çseiha was a non-regional coalition, as opposed to Araki's reintroduction of regional politics into army promotions and policy decisions. Many T≈çseiha members were promising graduates of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and Army Staff College, and were concerned about Araki's emphasis of the spiritual morale of the army instead of modernization and mechanization. Rather than the confrontational approach of the K≈çd≈çha, which wanted to bring about the Showa Restoration through violence and revolution, the T≈çseiha sought reform by working within the existing system. The T≈çseiha foresaw that a future war would be a total war, and to maximize Japan's industrial and military capacity would require the cooperation of Japan's bureaucracy and the zaibatsu conglomerates which the K≈çd≈çha despised.Buruma, Inventing Japan, 1854-1964, page 98 The K≈çd≈çha was strongly supportive of the hokushin-ron (\\"Northern Expansion Doctrine\\") strategy of a preemptive strike against the Soviet Union, believing that Siberia was in Japan's sphere of interest; although there were supporters of the Northern Expansion in the T≈çseiha, the faction largely favored a more cautious defense expansion.Samuels, Securing Japan: Tokyo's Grand Strategy and the Future of East Asia, p. 27 The name \\"T≈çseiha\\" was pejorative and was coined and used only by K≈çd≈çha members and sympathizers. Decline In late 1931, the Manchurian Incident and the subsequent Japanese invasion of Manchuria saw the two factions struggle against each other for dominance over the military.Edwin P. Hoyt, Japan's War, p 118-9 The K≈çd≈çha were initially dominant, but after Araki's resignation in 1934 due to ill health their influence began to wane. The February 26 Incident in February 1936 caused a widespread purge of the K≈çd≈çha leadership from the military and the faction was de facto dissolved, while the T≈çseiha became the dominant influence in the Japanese military but lost most of its raison d'√™tre and gradually disbanded.Harries, Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army, page 191 See also *K≈çd≈çha References  Notes Politics of the Empire of Japan Imperial Japanese Army Japanese militarism Anti-communist organizations in Japan ","title":"T≈çseiha"},{"id":"2857056","text":"Dr Banda and Kanyama Chiume on an official visit in the early 1960s Kanyama Chiume (22 November 1929 ‚Äì 21 November 2007), born Murray William Kanyama Chiume, was a leading nationalist in the struggle for Malawi's independence in the 1950s and 1960s. He was also one of the leaders of the Nyasaland African Congress and served as the Minister of Education and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the 1960s before fleeing the country after the 1964 Cabinet Crisis. Early life and education CHiume was born in Nkhata Bay District, Nyasaland, and described his given name, Kanyama, as meaning \\"another piece of meat for you,\\" a wry joke by parents who had grown wearily accustomed to death in their family. Chiume's younger brother died at two months, and Chiume's own mother died the following day, aged 37. After the funeral, Chiume went with his uncle to his native Tanganyika (now Tanzania). He attended schools in Dar es Salaam in the mid-1940s, at a time when this coastal city was a hotbed of African nationalist political activity. In his last year at Tabora Upper School he became Secretary of the Debating Society, polishing rhetorical skills which would later be much admired when he entered politics in Nyasaland (now Malawi). At Tabora Upper School he reportedly invited an alumnus, Julius Nyerere, to join him in debating against white colonial teachers and administrators on political subjects. According to Chiume in his autobiography (the strict veracity of which has sometimes been questioned), they were so successful in this debate that the school threatened him with expulsion. Nyerere later became the first leader of independent Tanzania. In 1949, Chiume went to Makerere College in Kampala, Uganda, the premier university in East Africa, and in 1951 he was admitted into Makerere College's Medicine School. He later changed his major to Education, after discovering that he \\"could not stand human dissection\\", specializing in Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Among his contemporaries at Makerere were people who would in later life become some of Africa's most accomplished scholars and public officials, including B. Ogot, Kenya's celebrated historian and Chancellor of Moi University in Eldoret, and the second Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki. He was president of the Makerere College Political Society, while Mwai Kibaki was a committee member. Later he was joined at Makerere by other Nyasas, Vincent Gondwe, David Rubadiri (former Vice Chancellor of the University of Malawi), and Augustine Bwanausi (former Malawi cabinet minister). Chiume was also chairperson of the Makerere College Education Society. Chiume and other students formed a Nyasaland Students Association at Makerere, an association that helped the Nyasaland African Congress by doing research, and by also linking up with fellow Nyasas at Fort Hare College, where Henry Masauko Chipembere, a lifelong friend and political colleague of Chiume's, went for his own university education. Another future leader of Nyasa nationalism, Dunduzu Chisiza, was also active in the Nyasaland Students Association at this time. After graduating from college Chiume taught at Alliance Secondary School in Dodoma, Tanganyika. He resigned after the white headmaster insinuated that the presence of a pre-adolescent girl in Chiume's house might create immoral temptations. Chiume was extremely offended by the remark, which further gave him resolve to fight for the dignity of Africans. \\"I had made up my mind there and then to plunge myself into politics and to help remove the obstacles that lay before Africans who wished to have human dignity. I was determined to try and play my part, however small, to free Mother Africa\\" (from his autobiography). He then went to study law, on a scholarship, at Ramjas College in Delhi, India. Upon being approached by the Nyasaland African Congress to stand in the country's first general election in 1956, Chiume accepted, and decided not to further pursue his interest in law. Malawi Independence In 1955, Nyasaland adopted a new constitution designed to give more representation to Africans, and in the elections which followed Chiume, along with Henry Chipembere, became one of five African representatives in the Legislative Council. He and Chipembere electrified the native population with their vigorous speeches and combative questions in the legislature, which had until then been a somewhat sedate body. As a result, Hansard, the official record of the Council's proceedings, became a bestseller among Nyasa Africans. Along with Chipembere and the Chisiza brothers (Dunduzu and Yatuta), Chiume became a driving force in organizing popular support in the mid to late 1950s for Hastings Banda and in persuading Banda to return to Nyasaland in order to lead the country to independence. He was given a senior post in the Congress at the Nkhata Bay conference in August 1958 when it adopted Dr Banda as its unquestioned leader. In March 1959, Chiume avoided arrest while he was in London during \\"Operation Sunrise\\" when the local colonial government rounded up and interned members of the Nyasaland African Congress during the state of emergency. In July 1960 he joined Banda, Orton Chirwa, Aleke Banda and other prominent Africans at the Nyasaland Constitutional Conference in London. It was here that British Government decided that Nyasaland (Malawi) should become self-governing by early 1963, and that Banda, should become prime minister. Chiume was made Minister of Education in 1962 and went on to become Foreign Minister in the first government formed after Malawi's official independence in July 1964. Tanzania exile Chiume was a key leader in the 1964 Malawi Cabinet Crisis. He was labeled the leader of the crisis and an enemy of Banda after displeasing Banda with a speech in Cairo during a conference for the Organisation of African Unity. He was subsequently driven out of the (now renamed) Malawi Congress Party and exiled to Tanzania from 1964 to 1994. While in exile, Chiume became active with Tanzania's \\"The Nationalist,\\" \\"Daily News and Sunday News,\\" and \\"Uhuru\\" newspapers. He also became and author and publisher of numerous books. He returned to Malawi in 1994 after internal and international pressure on Dr. Banda. After his return Chiume briefly served as Chairman of Malawi National Library Service and the Malawi Book Service.

It was completed in 1658 as the second of the De Redin towers. Today, the tower is in good condition. History Gƒßallis Tower was built in 1658 on the eastern shore of Gƒßallis Point (), commanding the entrance to Salina Bay along with Qawra Tower, one of the Lascaris towers. The tower was built on or near the site of a medieval watch post. It follows the standard design of the De Redin towers, having a square plan with two floors and a turret on the roof. The external wall is made of upper coralline limestone which is weather resistant while the inner wall is made of the softer globogerina limestone. It originally had a garrison consisting of a bombardier and three gunners, who manned a three-pounder iron cannon. During the British period, Gƒßallis Tower was modified by opening a doorway at ground level and the insertion of roof slabs. On 9 March 1955, the corpse of Toninu Aquilina, a 35-year-old employee of the Malta Millers Association, was found inside the tower's well. Aquilina had gone missing in Valletta on 24 February while carrying a large sum of cash and cheques from his workplace to a bank, and the 31-year-old cashier George Terreni was later convicted of his murder.Abela-Bambinu, M.

The interior was also damaged due to soot from the many fires lit inside the tower. Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa restored the tower between 1995 and 1996, and many stonework had to be replaced. Today, it is still under the control of Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa and is in good condition. It is open to the public by appointment. In 2015, an LED lighting system was installed at Gƒßallis Tower. Since the tower is off Malta's electricity grid, the energy was provided by solar panels installed on the tower's roof.

The vertices of these triangles are created from field recorded spot elevations through a variety of means including surveying through conventional, Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinematic (GPS RTK), photogrammetry, or some other means. Associated with three-dimensional data (x, y, and z) and topography, TINs are useful for the description and analysis of general horizontal (x and y) distributions and relationships. Digital TIN data structures are used in a variety of applications, including geographic information systems (GIS), and computer aided drafting (CAD) for the visual representation of a topographical surface. A TIN is a vector-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed nodes and lines with three-dimensional coordinates (x, y, and z) that are arranged in a network of non-overlapping triangles. A TIN comprises a triangular network of vertices, known as mass points, with associated coordinates in three dimensions connected by edges to form a triangular tessellation. Three-dimensional visualizations are readily created by rendering of the triangular facets. In regions where there is little variation in surface height, the points may be widely spaced whereas in areas of more intense variation in height the point density is increased. A TIN used to represent terrain is often called a digital elevation model (DEM), which can be further used to produce digital surface models (DSM) or digital terrain models (DTM). An advantage of using a TIN over a rasterized digital elevation model (DEM) in mapping and analysis is that the points of a TIN are distributed variably based on an algorithm that determines which points are most necessary to create an accurate representation of the terrain. Data input is therefore flexible and fewer points need to be stored than in a raster DEM, with regularly distributed points. While a TIN may be considered less suited than a raster DEM for certain kinds of GIS applications, such as analysis of a surface's slope and aspect, it is often used in CAD to create contour lines. A DTM and DSM can be formed from a DEM. A DEM can be interpolated from a TIN. TIN are based on a Delaunay triangulation or constrained Delaunay. Delaunay conforming triangulations are recommended over constrained triangulations. This is because the resulting TINs are likely to contain fewer long, skinny triangles, which are undesirable for surface analysis. Additionally, natural neighbor interpolation and Thiessen (Voronoi) polygon generation can only be performed on Delaunay conforming triangulations. A constrained Delaunay triangulation can be considered when you need to explicitly define certain edges that are guaranteed not to be modified (that is, split into multiple edges) by the triangulator. Constrained Delaunay triangulations are also useful for minimizing the size of a TIN, since they have fewer nodes and triangles where breaklines are not densified. The TIN model was developed in the early 1970s as a simple way to build a surface from a set of irregularly spaced points. The first triangulated irregular network program for GIS was written by W. Randolph Franklin, under the direction of David Douglas and Thomas Peucker (Poiker), at Simon Fraser University in 1973.Franklin, W. R. (1973). Triangulated irregular network program.

Produced by Broomsticks Productions Limited, the film stars Tia Mowry and Tamera Mowry as Alexandra Fielding and Camryn Barnes, respectively. A sequel, Twitches Too, aired on October 12, 2007, as a part of Disney Channel's Hauntober Fest. Plot In the magical dimension of Coventry, the royal witch Miranda gives birth to identical twin daughters on Halloween night. The sisters are named Apolla and Artemis after the Olympian twins, the gods of the sun and moon, respectively; in accordance with their namesakes, Apolla wears an amulet in the shape of the sun and Artemis wears an amulet in the shape of the moon. Their father Aron DuBaer, a powerful warlock, transfers the entirety of his magical powers to protect them from an evil entity known as the Darkness and is killed in the process. Karsh and Ileana WarBurton, a magical couple and friends of the family, assume the task of protecting the twins and flee to a non-magical dimension known as Earth to give them up for adoption. Apolla is adopted by a wealthy couple who name her Camryn Elizabeth Barnes, while Artemis is adopted by a single mother and is named Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Nicole Fielding. Alex grows up to be a night owl and stays up until the moon sets, writing about the chronicles of magical twin sisters, unaware that her stories are true. She shares a single bedroom with her close friend Lucinda, after her mother passes away a few months prior to her 21st birthday. Meanwhile, Camryn is a passionate artist and a lark, who wakes up at sunrise to sketch realistic pictures; unbeknownst to her, the images she creates are of Miranda and her homeland Coventry. She is spoiled and outgoing, unlike her quiet and reclusive sister; however, the duo share the traits of kindness and intelligence. On the twins' 21st birthday, Camryn and her best friend Beth decide to shop, while Alex tries to look for a job. After Karsh and Ileana manipulate Alex into entering the store where Camryn is trying on clothes, the sisters encounter each other for the first time since their infancy. Although Camryn is overjoyed to discover Alex, the latter flees the store, prompting the former to grasp her hand, causing a burst of energy. As their magic is released, they discover that they share a sisterly bond and attempt to understand each other. Karsh and Ileana reveal themselves to the twins and inform them about their magical background, after which Alex realizes that her stories about Coventry are true. According to an old prophecy, the sisters are the only ones capable of vanquishing the Darkness and restoring Coventry. As she has the gift of knowledge, Alex refuses to help fulfill the prophecy because her stories end with death. Camryn manages to convince Alex to stay, assuring her that they are unstoppable together, and the two practice their magical powers as they bond. They dub themselves Twitches, a portmanteau of the words \\"twin\\" and \\"witches.\\" In the meantime, Miranda senses that her daughters are alive and informs their uncle Thantos, whom she married after Aron's death. The Darkness arrives at Alex's apartment, but the sisters manage to transport themselves to Coventry, and the experience overwhelms Camryn. Despite her sister's pleas, she decides that she does not want to venture further into their destiny. She leaves to participate in her costume birthday party on Earth. Alex, determined to help Coventry without her sister, reunites with Miranda and meets Thantos, who informs her that if Camryn is alone, she is powerless against the Darkness. At her party, due to the gift of sight, Camryn realizes that Thantos is responsible for the Darkness, and she escapes to Coventry after Karsh and Ileana sacrifice themselves to help her. As she reveals her uncle's crimes to Miranda and Alex, Thantos arrives and admits to killing his brother Aron in an attempt to acquire wealth and power. The twins combine their magic of light and love to vanquish him and restore Coventry, simultaneously reviving Karsh and Ileana. They then celebrate their birthday on Earth, alongside Miranda and Camryn's adoptive parents, David and Emily.

For the first few days of filming, the cast and crew had a hard time telling Tia and Tamera apart. =Filming= Production for the film began in June 2005, entirely shot in Toronto, Ontario. Special effects were used in conjunction with green screens to help simulate the magic tricks shown throughout the movie - the transitions between Earth and Coventry, the moon and sun put on the same horizon, and, with the aid of a wind machine, the visualization of the Darkness' presence. Release and reception =Broadcast= When the movie first aired on Disney Channel on October 14, 2005, it was viewed by 7 million viewers. In four subsequent airings during its first weekend, the movie drew a total of 21.5 million viewers and was the week's most popular cable program. =Home media= Twitches was released on Disney+ in August 2020. =Critical response= Due to an insufficient number of reviews, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes lacks a score for the movie. Audience reviews were mostly positive with 65% of 23,971 users giving the film a positive review, with an average rating of 3.4 out of five.

He was also the semiofficial Ambassador of Bahamian Goodwill. Gibson was born on the small island of Acklins to a musical family, although he didn't pursue music until his adulthood. After leading several musical acts in the 1950s, Gibson formed King Eric & His Knights around 1957, which specialized in a modernized style of calypso music, a type of Caribbean folk music that received worldwide recognition when American singer Harry Belafonte released the album Calypso in 1956. King Eric & His Knights enjoyed immediate popularity among tourists in Nassau, almost certainly due to their performances of the Calypso folksongs made famous by Belafonte. The band regularly performed at nightclubs and hotels, where their records (often in high demand by both tourists and locals) could be purchased in the gift shop. In 1966, Gibson opened a recording studio to support other native Bahamian musicians. While the lineup of the Knights continued to rotate, King Eric & His Knights remained a popular musical staple in Nassau, often headlining music festivals. In 1973, Gibson formed the \\"King & Knights Club\\", a nightclub that not only featured the band, but a variety show that included carnival-style entertainment such as fire juggling and limbo dancing. It was renamed \\"The Blue Note\\" in 2006. King Eric & His Knights also enjoyed popularity outside of the Bahamas, touring in North America and Australia. While the international appeal of calypso music has dwindled in recent times, Gibson remains a successful entertainer and businessman in Nassau. He is active in the regatta and maintains a successful racing sloop; he also owns an Italian-Bahamian restaurant. Gibson and his common law wife, Brigitte Neven, were in Florida at the time of Anna Nicole Smith's death.

The Hoyle trademark and facecards were used under license from Brown & Bigelow Inc. =Games= The games included are: Crazy Eights, Old Maid, Hearts, Gin Rummy, Cribbage, and Klondike. = Characters = For all games, except the last, the player could choose opponents, each having their own AI and manner of playing. These opponents included historical figures, members of Sierra staff, and characters from Sierra games. When the player took too long making a decision, the characters started having dialogues, each according to his background. For example, Leisure Suit Larry begins to comment about women, while Roger Wilco wants to escape the game to save the universe again. *Sonny Bonds *Bulldog *Cassie *Christina *Devin *Diane *Colonel Henri Dijon *King Graham *The Kid *Larry Laffer *Shelly LeBlanc *Lenny *Jerry Moore *Princess Rosella *Warren Schwader *Sol Silverman *Thelma *Roger Wilco =Development= The original concept was submitted to Ken Williams (CEO/Founder of Sierra On- line) by Warren Schwader. Once the project was greenlit, Warren acted as the Lead Programmer as well as the Game Designer. The games were programmed using Sierra On-line's proprietary scripting language: Sierra Creative Interpreter (SCI). SCI was originally created to aid in the development of Sierra's core line of adventure games. Working with SCI to implement card games and to code artificial intelligence for the characters proved challenging. Warren Schwader continued as the Lead Programmer and Game Designer for the next two games in the series. Rob Atesalp was the composer and sound designer for the original and next two games. =Reception= The game sold over 250,000 copies by 1990.Sierra News Magazine (Fall 1990), vol. 3 issue 3, page 12. Volume 2 Hoyle's Official Book of Games: Volume 2 is the next volume in the Hoyle card games simulator series by Sierra Entertainment. This time, the pack offered 28 games, as opposed to the first volume's six. The other main difference between the two was that all the games were solitaire variants, so there was no option for choosing opponents. Subsequently, the game did not feature any Sierra characters for co-players. The 28 solitaire games offered are: Calculation, Strategy, Eagle Wing, Beleaguered Castle, Klondike, Canfield, Golf, Flower Garden, Scorpion, Spiderette, La Belle Lucie, Fortress, Baker's Dozen, Bristol, Eight Off, Shamrocks, Yukon, Eliminator, Slide, Bowling, Nestor, Aces Up, Gaps, Penguin, Pyramid, Triplets, and Poker Square. Volume 3 Hoyle's Official Book of Games: Volume 3 was the third volume in Sierra On-Line's series of computer games based on the officially licensed Hoyle rules and trademark. Unlike the two previous games, this one was made with Sierra's new improved VGA engine, and focused on board games, where the previous entries in the series had featured card games. Games featured were Backgammon, Checkers, Dominoes, Yacht (the original ancestor of the trademarked game Yahtzee), Pachisi, and Snakes and Ladders. =Characters= Like the first volume, and unlike the second volume, this game offers Sierra characters as opponents in the various games. They do not interact with each other or have conversations as in the first game, but several of them have themed comments, catch phrase or accented style comments (though these are uncommon). For example, the Sheriff may refer to himself as the \\"Great Nottingham\\", or Baba Yaga who refers to her opponents as 'dearie'. Some characters are more specific than others, and some are more generic. It also depends on the game, a character might have more interesting things to say about plays in one game, but have generic comments to say in another. ;Good guys * Mother Goose (Mixed-Up Mother Goose) * King Graham (King's Quest series) * Rosella (King's Quest series) * Larry Laffer (Leisure Suit Larry series) * Passionate Patti (Leisure Suit Larry series) * Jones (Jones in the Fast Lane) * Sonny Bonds (Police Quest series) * Roger Wilco (Space Quest series) * Laura Bow (The Colonel's Bequest and The Dagger of Amon Ra) ;Evil guys * Ad Avis (Quest for Glory II) * Baba Yaga (Quest for Glory I) * Lillian (The Colonel's Bequest) * Arnoid (Space Quest III) * Mordack (King's Quest V) * Mr. Big (Leisure Suit Larry V) * Lolotte (King's Quest IV) * Vohaul (Space Quest II) * Sheriff of Nottingham (Conquests of the Longbow) Hoyle Classic Card Games (Hoyle 4) Hoyle Classic Card Games (Hoyle 4) was a remake of Volume I, released with VGA support, speech and original soundtrack. There was a set with 'Classic Characters' to play with and one with an increased number of Sierra characters as well. Load screens involve a silly comments made by the Classic characters, in relationship to whatever game was loading. The number of games was increased to eight, with the inclusion of Contract Bridge and Euchre. There is some digitized speech for each character. Each character has five unique expressions in full speech (ranging from dislike at the plays, happiness, or praise). There are a few additional text based messages in theme for each character for some of the games, but only relate to the gameplay (characters do not have conversations with each other outside of the scope of the game). All the artwork and character sprites look like old fashioned and sepia-toned.

Reception Computer Gaming World stated that interacting with Sierra characters in Volume 1 such as Leisure Suit Larry and Princess Rosella was fun, but annoying for those who preferred cards to humor. It criticized Volume 1 for slow performance and cribbage's deviation from the official Hoyle's rules, and stated that the other games were \\"really children's games and offer no great excitement\\".

The most numerous enterprises were single proprietorships, of which there were more than 4 million in the late 1980s. The dominant form of organization; however, is the Corporation. In 1988 some 2 million corporations employed more than 30 million workers, or nearly half of the total labor force of 60.1 million people. Corporations range from large to small, but the favored type of organization is the joint-stock company, with directors, auditors, and yearly stockholders' meetings. History Japan's postwar business system dates back to the dissolution of the zaibatsu during the Allied occupation. Central holding companies were dissolved and families and other owners were compensated with non-negotiable government bonds. Individual operating firms were then freed to act independently. At the same time, the government instituted antimonopoly legislation and formed the Fair Trade Commission. Together with agricultural land reform and the start of the labor movement, these measures helped introduce a degree of competition into markets that had not previously existed. It was not long, however, before the spirit and the letter of these reform laws were neglected. During the 1950s, government guidance of industry often sidestepped the provisions of the law. While market forces determined the course of the vast majority of enterprise activities, adjustments in the allocation of bank credit and the formation of cartels favored the reemergence of conglomerate groupings (keiretsu). These groups competed vigorously with one another for market share both within and outside Japan, but they dominated lesser industry. In contrast to the dualism of the prewar era--featuring a giant gap between modern, large enterprises and the smaller, traditional firms--the postwar system is more graduated. Interlocking production and sales arrangements between greater and smaller enterprises characterized corporate relations in most markets. The average Japanese business executive is well aware of the firms that lead production and sales in each industry and is sensitive to minute differentiations of rank among the many corporations. Types of Corporations At the top of the corporate system are three general types of corporate groupings. The first includes the corporate heirs of the Zaibatsu, (including many of the same firms). The second consists of corporations that formed around major commercial banks. The nation's six largest groupings are in these two categories. Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo are former zaibatsu, while other groupings were formed around the Fuji-Sankei, Sanwa, and Dai-ichi Kangyo banking giants. A third type of corporate grouping developed around large industrial producers. The relations among the members of the first two types of groups are flexible, informal, and quite different from the holding company pattern of the prewar days. Coordination takes place at periodic gatherings of corporation presidents and chief executive officers. The purpose of these meetings is to exchange information and ideas rather than to command group operations in a formal way. The general trading firms associated with each group can also be used to coordinate group finance, production, and marketing policies, although none of these relationships is entirely exclusive. The practice of crossholding shares of group stock further cements these groups, and such holdings usually make up about 30 percent of the total group equity. Member corporations typically, although not exclusively, borrow from group banks. Similar relationships characterize the third type of corporate group, which was established around a major industrial producer. Members of this group are often subsidiaries or affiliates of the parent firm or are regular subcontractors. Subsidiaries and contracting corporations normally build components for the parent firm and, because of their smaller size, afford several benefits to the parent. The larger firm can concentrate on final assembly and high value-added processes, while the smaller firm can perform specialized and labor-intensive tasks. Cash payments to the subcontractors are supplemented by commercial bills whose maturity can be postponed when the need arose. In the late 1980s, subcontracting firms accounted for more than 60 percent of Japan's 6 million small and medium-sized enterprises (those having fewer than 300 employees). This characterization of the economy as consisting of neat, hierarchical corporate groupings is somewhat simplistic. In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of independent middle-sized firms-- especially in the services and retail trade--were busy catering to increasingly diversified and specialized markets. Unaffiliated with the nation's large conglomerates, these corporations dueled each other in a highly competitive market. Bankruptcies among such companies and the smaller firms were much more common than among the large enterprises. Small business was the main provider of employment for the Japanese--two-thirds of Japanese workers were employed by small firms throughout the 1980s--and thereby the source of consumer demand; small business engaged in almost half of business investment as well. The issue of who controlled the enterprise system is complex. While theoretically corporations are owned by stockholders, individual stock-ownership fell throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1990 it was less than 30 percent. Financial corporations accounted for the remainder. Relative to capital, almost all large corporations carry enormous debt, a phenomenon known as over- borrowing. Such an unbalanced capital structure results from the easy availability of credit from the main group bank and the network of corporate relations, which reduces the need to resort to capital markets. Corporate shareholder meetings are often only window dressing. Thugs sometimes terrorize stockholders, demanding payments to vote for management or refrain from exposing scandals. The auditing system also is not well developed. Until the late 1980s, few companies engaged outside auditors, and accounting practices gave corporations room to mislead both the public and the shareholders. The law was changed in 1981 to control this kind of excess, to enhance the power of auditors, and to reduce the number of stockholders in the employ of management. But in general, it seems that business management holds the reins of corporate control, often with little public accountability. The corporate system maintains itself by smoothing relations with the government bureaucracy, expanding benefits to workers and consumers, and increasingly engaging in public relations and philanthropy.

He had been told, he said, that he was England's first \\"foreign-born judge\\" in eight hundred years, though he himself was careful neither to confirm nor refute the suggestion. Life and career Michael Kerr was born in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Germany, the son of the composer-musician Julia Anna Franziska (Weismann) and the drama critic Alfred Kerr. He was the brother of the author Judith Kerr. His family was Jewish. Kerr and his family were forced to leave their homeland at the end of the Weimar Republic by the emergence of the Nazi Party. After 1933, the Kerr family lived in Switzerland, France and finally Great Britain, as noted in his sister's writing. His experience as an immigrant allowed him to perfect skills in not only German but also in French and English. Sponsored by a friend of his father, Kerr was educated at Aldenham School. This and his immigration experience may have created a wish to emulate and join the upper middle class of his new homeland. Kerr was beginning his studies at Clare College, Cambridge when Second World War began. During the war, Kerr was at first identified as an enemy alien and interned at temporary camps around the country before being sent to the Central Promenade Camp in Douglas, Isle of Man. He was released on the intervention of the Home Secretary and he later served as a pilot in the Royal Air Force, reaching the rank of flight lieutenant. After the war, he returned to Cambridge to study law and became a naturalised British subject in 1946. His career eventually led him to the High Court, where he believed that he was the first senior judge born an alien since the 12th century. Kerr chaired the Law Commission from 1978‚Äì81, before serving on the Court of Appeal, and finally on the London Court of International Arbitration. Kerr married Julia Braddock in 1953 and had three children, Candy, Jo and Tim born in 1954, 1956 and 1958. The couple separated in 1977 but Julia did not agree to the divorce so Kerr had to wait the statutory five years. Tim was appointed to the High Court in 2015. Kerr married Diana Sneezum on 29 January 1983 and had two children, Lucy who was born in 1984 and Alexander in 1987. They remained happily married until Kerr's death in 2002. In his autobiography As Far As I Remember he tells of his family, also reflected in books by his sister such as When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit, and about his career in the British law system. His short, analytic writing is reminiscent of his father's style. Publication * As Far As I Remember.

History The station signed on the air as WONO in 1956, with a classical music format. In 1979, the station's new owner, Roy H. Park Broadcasting, changed its call sign to WRRB and installed a country music format. Over the next decade and a half, 107.9 FM has changed formats and call letters several times; these formats included adult contemporary, album-oriented rock, easy listening/classical (as WRHP), and country again (as WHEN-FM, \\"Hit Country 108\\"). In 1996, WHEN-FM was sold to Cox Communications, owners of country format competitor WBBS (B104.7). On June 10 of that year, the station flipped to contemporary hit radio (CHR) with new call letters WWHT.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-06-14.pdf; WWHT was one of a group of five stations included in a trade between Cox and Jacor Communications in 1999 when Cox exited the Syracuse market. Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) subsequently acquired Jacor in April 1999. While classified as a mainstream CHR and playing mainstream pop and rock, WWHT focused heavily on rhythmic and dance hits. In 2010, WWHT added more rhythmic songs and reduced non-rhythmic content, a trend that several top-40 stations were adopting at the time, and by January 2011 had shifted completely to rhythmic top 40. This resulted in WWHT being moved from the mainstream top 40 reporting panels of both Nielsen BDS and Mediabase panels to their respective rhythmic panels in November 2011. In October 2012, WWHT returned to mainstream top 40, dropping almost all rhythmic-only content, but because most of the station's programming was voice-tracked, Nielsen BDS did not include its playlist in its Top 40/CHR panel.

With the rise to cricket prominence of his son, also called Joseph (Joe), he is generally referred to as \\"Joe Hardstaff senior\\" or \\"Joe Hardstaff Sr\\". Hardstaff made his debut during 1902, playing one match against Lancashire scoring 2. He was a central figure in the Notts side until he retired at the end of the 1924 season. He was primarily a middle-order batsman, though he occasionally bowled medium, especially after the war. Having helped his county to its first County Championship in 1907, he was picked for the tour to Australia in 1907/08, captained by the Nottinghamshire county captain Arthur Jones. Hardstaff was a big success on the tour, scoring more runs in first-class matches than any other batsman, and coming third, behind George Gunn and Jack Hobbs, in the Test matches. His subsequent form precluded further selection for although he passed 1000 runs seven times in England, and once on his sole overseas tour. Apart from 1911, he rarely featured amongst the leading batsmen in the averages. He was selected, surprisingly,Wisden Cricketers Almanack 1911 in 1910, for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lords.

The species ranges throughout most of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Most of its populations appear stable, and it is not listed as endangered in any of the states comprising its range. It lives in a wide variety of habitats, including deserts and semiarid shrubland, usually in areas with sparse vegetation; it also may be found in woodland, open dry forest, and riparian growth. It lives in burrows. Major differences between this species and the checkered whiptail (Aspidoscelis tesselatus) include the lack of enlarged scales anterior to the gular fold and the presence of enlarged postantebrachial scales. It was previously known as Cnemidophorus tigris, until phylogenetic analyses concluded that the genus Cnemidophorus was polyphyletic. Since it does not migrate, a number of forms have developed in different regions, several of which have been given subspecific names ‚Äì for example the California whiptail, Aspidoscelis tigris munda. Description A. t. multiscutatus The western whiptail has a long and slender body, small grainy scales on its back, and larger rectangular scales on its belly. The upper side often has light stripes, and the throat can be pinkish or somewhat orange in adults. The maximum snout-to-vent length (SVL) is 102 mm (about 4 inches), and maximum total length (including tail) is 305 mm (about 12 inches).Smith, Hobart M.; Brodie, Edmund D., Jr. (1982).

Desert subspecies prefer habitat with vegetation such as sagebrush or shadscale, and rely on burrows to escape the desert heat.McCoy, C.J. (1965). Life history and ecology of Cnemidophorus tigris septentrionalis. Ph.D. thesis, University of Colorado, Boulder. In the northern parts of its range, the western whiptail usually emerges from hibernation in May, and most adults aestivate during the midsummer months, but in the south it is active from April through late August. The seasonal period of activity is therefore considerably shorter in the north. Daily periods of activity are of similar duration from north to south, although the time of emergence tends to be later in northern areas. Reproduction and sexual characteristics The western whiptail's chromosomes show that it is polyploid. It is also a bisexual species, containing both males and females, unlike other species of Aspidoscelis which are all-female. Usually in the northern end of its range, mating occurs in the first half of June, and females begin to lay eggs in late June. The eggs usually begin hatching by mid-August. Females will only lay one clutch (number of eggs laid at a single time) per year. At the southern end of its range, however, females will begin to lay eggs as early as May, and the eggs will usually hatch as early as mid-June. In the southern end of its range, females may also lay two clutches per year instead of just one.Vitt, Laurie J. (1977). \\"Ecology and Reproduction of Lower Colorado River Lizards: II.

Tail drop When being attacked by a predator, the western whiptail will drop its tail. The muscles in the tail will continue contracting causing the tail to flop around. This is used to distract the predator from the lizard. However, this is a last ditch effort. It is very stressful for the lizard. It takes a lot of energy to regrow the tail, and the lizard loses a lot of stored food. This is a tactic often used when the lizard is threatened by a domestic or feral cat. Subspecies Including the nominotypical subspecies, 16 subspecies of Aspidoscelis tigris are recognized as being valid.\\"Aspidoscelis tigris \\".

The question of whether it is right to eat animal flesh is among the most prominent topics in food ethics. People choose not to eat meat for various reasons such as concern for animal welfare, the environmental impact of meat production (environmental vegetarianism), and health considerations. Some argue that slaughtering animals solely because people enjoy the taste of meat is morally wrong or unjustifiable.Harnad, Stevan (2013) Luxe, n√©cessit√©, souffrance: Pourquoi je ne suis pas carnivore . Qu√©bec humaniste 8(1): 10-13 Vegans often abstain from other animal products for similar reasons. Ethical vegetarians and ethical vegansRonald L. Sandler, Food Ethics: The Basics, Routledge, 2014, p. 74. may also object to the practices underlying the production of meat, or cite concerns about animal welfare, animal rights, environmental ethics, and religious reasons. In response, some proponents of meat-eating have adduced various scientific, cultural, and religious arguments in support of the practice. Some meat-eaters only object to rearing animals in certain ways, such as in factory farms, or killing them with cruelty; others avoid only certain meats, such as veal or foie gras.  Overview of the argument against meat eating  Cattle carcasses in a slaughterhouse. Peter Singer‚ÄîPrinceton University and University of Melbourne professor and pioneer of the animal liberation movement‚Äîhas long argued that, if it is possible to survive and be healthy without eating meat, fish, dairy, or eggs, one ought to choose that option instead of causing unnecessary harm to animals. In Animal Liberation, Singer argued that, because non-human animals feel, they should be treated according to utilitarian ethics. Singer's work has since been widely built upon by philosophers, both those who agreeMark Rowlands (2013). Animal rights: All that matters. Hodder & Stoughton and those who do not, and it has been applied by animal rights advocates as well as by ethical vegetarians and vegans. Ethical vegetarians say that the reasons for not hurting or killing animals are similar to the reasons for not hurting or killing humans. They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious of their behavior and have a choice; this is why there are laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards. Ethical vegetarian concerns have become more widespread in developed countries, particularly because of the spread of factory farming, more open and graphic documentation of what human meat-eating entails for the animal,Eisnitz, G. A. (2009). Slaughterhouse: The shocking story of greed, neglect, and inhumane treatment inside the US meat industry. Prometheus Books. Chicago and environmental consciousness. Some proponents of meat-eating argue that the current mass demand for meat has to be satisfied with a mass- production system, regardless of the welfare of animals. Less radical proponents argue that practices like well-managed free-range rearing and the consumption of hunted animals, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could satisfy the demand for mass-produced meat. Reducing the worldwide massive food waste would also contribute to reduce meat waste and therefore save animals. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about a third of the food for human consumption is wasted globally (around 1.3 billion tons per year). Some have described unequal treatment of humans and animals as a form of speciesism such as anthropocentrism or human-centeredness. Val Plumwood (1993, 1996) has argued that anthropocentrism plays a role in green theory that is analogous to androcentrism in feminist theory and ethnocentrism in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness \\"anthropocentrism\\" to emphasize this parallel. By analogy with racism and sexism, Melanie Joy has dubbed meat-eating \\"carnism\\". The animal rights movement seeks an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction drawn between human and non-human animals, an end to the status of animals as property, and an end to their use in the research, food, clothing, and entertainment industries. Peter Singer, in his ethical philosophy of what it is to be a \\"person\\", argues that livestock animals feel enough to deserve better treatment than they receive. Many thinkers have questioned the morality not only of the double standard underlying speciesism but also the double standard underlying the fact that people support treatment of cows, pigs, and chickens that they would never allow with pet dogs, cats, or birds. Jay Bost, agroecologist and winner of The New York Times essay contest on the ethics of eating meat, summarized his argument in the following way: \\"eating meat raised in specific circumstances is ethical; eating meat raised in other circumstances is unethical\\" in regard to environmental usage. He proposes that if \\"ethical is defined as living in the most ecologically benign way, then in fairly specific circumstances, of which each eater must educate himself, eating meat is ethical.\\" The specific circumstances he mentions include using animals to cycle nutrients and convert sun to food. Ethicists like Tom Regan and Peter Singer define \\"ethical\\" in terms of suffering rather than ecology. Mark Rowlands argues that the real determinant of whether it is ethical to cause suffering is whether there is any vital need to cause it; if not, then causing it is unethical. Animal consciousness Shorthorn heifers, a typical multipurpose breed of cattle. Ethologist Jane Goodall stated in the 2009 book The Inner World of Farm Animals that \\"farm animals feel pleasure and sadness, excitement and resentment, depression, fear and pain. They are much more sensitive and intelligent than we ever imagined.\\"Goodall J (April 2009), The Inner World of Farm Animals. Stewart, Tabori and Chang. In 2012, a group of well known neuroscientists stated in the \\"Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness in Non- Human Animals\\" that all mammals and birds (such as farm animals), and other animals, possess the neurological substrates that generate consciousness and are able to experience affective states.Low P, Panksepp J, Reiss D, Edelman D, Van Swinderen B, Koch C (July 2012). \\"The Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness\\". Eugene Linden, author of The Parrot's Lament, suggests that many examples of animal behavior and intelligence seem to indicate both emotion and a level of consciousness that we would normally ascribe only to our own species. Philosopher Daniel Dennett counters: Philosophers Peter Singer (Princeton), Jeff McMahan (Oxford) and others also counter that the issue is not one of consciousness, but of sentience. =Pain= A related argument revolves around non-human organisms' ability to feel pain. If animals could be shown to suffer, as humans do, then many of the arguments against human suffering could be extended to animals. One such reaction is transmarginal inhibition, a phenomenon observed in humans and some animals akin to mental breakdown. As noted by John Webster (emeritus professor of animal husbandry at the University of Bristol): = Influences on views of animal consciousness = When people choose to do things about which they are ambivalent and which they would have difficulty justifying, they experience a state of cognitive dissonance, which can lead to rationalization, denial, or even self-deception. For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's attention, they tend to rate those animals as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the harm is not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat go to great lengths to try to resolve these moral inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviour by adjusting their beliefs about what animals are capable of feeling. This perception can lead to paradoxical conclusions about the ethics and comfort involved in preferring certain types of meat over others. For example, venison or meat from a wild deer generally has a much higher nutritional quality and a much lower carbon footprint than meat from domestically-raised animals. In addition, it can be virtually assured that the deer was never bred or raised in unnatural conditions, confined to a cage, fed an unnatural diet of grain, or injected with any artificial hormones. However, since the necessary act of killing a deer to procure the venison is generally much more apparent to anyone who encounters this sort of meat, some people can be even more uncomfortable with eating this than meat from animals raised on factory farms. Many ethical vegetarians and ethical meat-eaters argue that it is behaviour rather than supporting beliefs that should be adjusted. Environmental argument monocultivated potato field Some people choose to be vegetarian or vegan for environmental reasons. According to a 2006 report by LEAD Livestock's Long Shadow, \\"the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.\\" The livestock sector is probably the largest source of water pollution (due to animal wastes, fertilizers, and pesticides), contributing to eutrophication, human health problems, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. It accounts also for over 8% of global human water use. Livestock production is by far the biggest user of land, as it accounts for 40% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, and overfishing. A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing we can do to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet. A 2017 study published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previously estimated. In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for, among other things, \\"promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods.\\" A 2019 report in The Lancet recommended that global meat consumption be reduced by 50 percent to mitigate climate change. Many developing countries, including China and India, are moving away from traditional plant-based diets to meat-intensive diets as the result of modernization and globalization, which has facilitated the spread of Western consumer cultures around the world. Over 200 billion animals are consumed by the global population of over 7 billion every year, and meat consumption is projected to more than double by 2050 as the population grows to over 9 billion. A 2018 study published in Science states that meat consumption could rise by as much as 76% by 2050 as the result of human population growth and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity. Animals that feed on grain or rely on grazing require more water than grain crops. Producing 1 kg of meat requires up to 15,000 liters of water. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), growing crops for farm animals requires nearly half of the US water supply and 80% of its agricultural land. Animals raised for food in the US consume 90% of the soy crop, 80% of the corn crop, and 70% of its grain. However, where an extensive farming system (as opposed to a feedlot) is used, some water and nutrients are returned to the soil to provide a benefit to the pasture. This cycling and processing of water and nutrients is less prevalent in most plant production systems, so may bring the efficiency rate of animal production closer to the efficiency of plant based agricultural systems.\\"Allan Savory: Holistic Management: A New Framework for Decision Making.\\" Thomas J. Elpel's Green University‚Ñ¢--Our Mission: To Change the World. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 March 2016 In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk, and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1. The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds, and fruits. There are also environmentalist arguments in favor of the morality of eating meat. One such line of argument holds that sentience and individual welfare are less important to morality than the greater ecological good. Following environmentalist Aldo Leopold's principle that the sole criterion for morality is preserving the \\"integrity, stability and beauty of the biotic community\\", this position asserts that sustainable hunting and animal agriculture are environmentally healthy and therefore good. Religious traditions of eating meat Cow slaughter laws in various states of India Hinduism holds vegetarianism as an ideal for three reasons: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only \\"pure\\" (vegetarian) or sattvic food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that an insentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is detrimental for the mind and for spiritual development. Buddhist vegetarianism has similar strictures against hurting animals. The actual practices of Hindus and Buddhists vary according to their community and according to regional traditions. Jains are especially rigorous about not harming sentient organisms. Islamic Law and Judaism have dietary guidelines called Halal and Kashrut, respectively. In Judaism, meat that may be consumed according to halakha (Jewish law) is termed kosher; meat that is not compliant with Jewish law is called treif. Causing unnecessary pain to animals is prohibited by the principle of tza'ar ba'alei chayim. While it is neither required nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Judaism, such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama, regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal. In Christianity as practised by members of Eastern Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, Greek Catholic Church, and others, it is prohibited to eat meat in times of fasting. Rules of fasting also vary. There are also Christian monastic orders that practice vegetarianism. Shinto has a concept of kegare, which means a state of pollution and defilement, and traditionally eating animals is thought to be one of them.Èï∑Ë∞∑ÈÉ®ÊÅµÁêÜ(Hasebe Eri)(2006) Ê±üÊà∏Êúü„Å´„Åä„Åë„Çã„ÄåËÇâ„Äç„Å®„ÄåËÇâÈ£ü„Äç„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„Çã‰∏ÄËÄÉÂØü Á¨¨2Á´†„ÄåËÇâÈ£ü„Äç„Å®„Ç∑„É≥„Éú„É™„Ç∫„É†(an examination of ‚Äúmeat‚Äù and ‚Äúeating meat‚Äù in the Edo Era, chapter ‚Ö° ‚Äúeating meat‚Äù and symbolism) Âç±Ê©ü„Å®ÊñáÂåñ : Êú≠ÂπåÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÊñáÂåñÂ≠¶ÈÉ®ÊñáÂåñÂ≠¶‰ºöÁ¥ÄË¶Å 8Âç∑ Eating animals having more legs is thought to be worse. (Eating mammals is worse than eating chickens or fish.) This concept leads to discrimination against slaughtermen and people who work with leather, who are called burakumin. Shinran, the founder of the Buddhist sect J≈çdo Shinsh≈´, taught that lower class who had to kill beings could enter nirvana even though killing animals was thought to be immoral. Criticisms and responses =Morals= It has been argued that a moral community requires all participants to be able to make moral decisions, but animals are incapable of making moral choices (e.g., a tiger would not refrain from eating a human because it was morally wrong; it would decide whether to attack based on its survival needs, as dictated by hunger). Thus, some opponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that the analogy between killing animals and killing people is misleading. For example, Hsiao (2015) compares the moral severity of harming animals to that of picking a flower or introducing malware into a computer. Others have argued that humans are capable of culture, innovation, and the sublimation of instinct in order to act in an ethical manner while animals are not, and so are unequal to humans on a moral level. This does not excuse cruelty, but it implies animals are not morally equivalent to humans and do not possess the rights a human has. The precise definition of a moral community is not simple, but Hsiao defines membership by the ability to know one's own good and that of other members, and to be able to grasp this in the abstract. He claims that non-human animals do not meet this standard. Benjamin Franklin describes his conversion to vegetarianism in chapter one of his autobiography, but then he describes why he (periodically) ceased vegetarianism in his later life: One study found that approximately 60% of contemporary professional ethicists consider it \\"morally bad\\" to eat meat from mammals. Writing in Current Affairs, Nathan J. Robinson describes the billions of non-human animals that suffer and die at the hands of human beings for consumption as a \\"holocaust\\" and, citing Jeremy Bentham's formulation \\"The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?\\" contends that it is \\"morally reprehensible\\" and \\"deeply wrong\\". Conversely, Jan Narveson argues that under certain theories of utilitarianism, positive utility can be increased by having more living organisms to experience it and thus by increasing the animal population so it can later be eaten, these theories could potentially justify raising animals for the purposes of consumption.Narveson, Jan. Moral matters. Broadview Press, 1999, page140-141 =Animal welfare= Various programs operate in the US that promote the notion that animals raised for food can be treated humanely. Some spokespeople for the factory farming industry argue that the animals are better off in total confinement. For example, according to F J \\"Sonny\\" Faison, president of Carroll's Foods: In response, animal welfare advocates ask for evidence that any factory-bred animal is better off caged than free.Matheny, G., & Leahy, C. (2007). Farm-animal welfare, legislation, and trade. Law and contemporary problems, 325-358. Farm Sanctuary argue that commodifying and slaughtering animals is incompatible with the definition of \\"humane\\".The Truth Behind The Labels: Farm Animal Welfare Standards and Labeling Practices Farm Sanctuary Animal ethicists such as Gary Francione have argued that reducing animal suffering is not enough; it needs to be made illegal and abolished. =Oysters= Peter Singer has pointed out that the ethical argument for vegetarianism may not apply to all non-vegetarian food. For example, any arguments against causing pain to animals would not apply to animals that do not feel pain. It has also often been noted that, while it takes a lot more grain to feed some animals such as cows for human consumption than it takes to feed a human directly, not all animals consume land plants (or other animals that consume land plants). For example, oysters consume underwater plankton and algae. In 2010, Christopher Cox wrote: Cox went on to suggest that oysters would be acceptable to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, if they did not feel: \\"while you could give them the benefit of the doubt, you could also say that unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters.\\" Cox has added that, although he believes in some of the ethical reasons for vegetarianism, he is not strictly a vegan or even a vegetarian because he consumes oysters. =Animal and plant pain= Critics of ethical vegetarianism say that there is no agreement on where to draw the line between organisms that can and cannot feel. Justin Leiber, a philosophy professor at Oxford University, writes that: There are also some who argue that, although only suffering animals feel anguish, plants, like all organisms, have evolved mechanisms for survival. No living organism can be described as \\"wanting\\" to die for another organism's sustenance. In an article written for The New York Times, Carol Kaesuk Yoon argues that: =Animals killed in crop harvesting= Steven Davis, a professor of animal science at Oregon State University, argues that the least harm principle does not require giving up all meat. Davis states that a diet containing beef from grass-fed ruminants such as cattle would kill fewer animals than a vegetarian diet, particularly when one takes into account animals killed by agriculture. This conclusion has been criticized by Jason Gaverick Matheny (founder of in vitro meat organization New Harvest) because it calculates the number of animals killed per acre (instead of per consumer). Matheny says that, when the numbers are adjusted, Davis' argument shows veganism as perpetrating the least harm. Davis' argument has also been criticized by Andy Lamey for being based on only two studies that may not represent commercial agricultural practices. When differentiating between animals killed by farm machinery and those killed by other animals, he says that the studies again show veganism to do the \\"least harm\\". Non-meat products Egg-laying chickens in battery cages One of the main differences between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they understand their production causes animal suffering or premature death and because of the environmental effect of dairy production. According to a report of the United Nations‚Äô Food and Agriculture Organization in 2010 the dairy sector accounted for 4 percent of global man-made greenhouse gas emissions. To produce milk from dairy cattle, most calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and fed milk replacement in order to retain the cows' milk for human consumption. Animal welfare advocates point out that this breaks the natural bond between the mother and her calf. Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production. To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination. Although cows' natural life expectancy is about twenty years, after about five years the cows' milk production has dropped; they are then considered \\"spent\\" and are sent to slaughter for meat and leather.Wolfson, D. J. (1996). Beyond the law: Agribusiness and the systemic abuse of animals raised for food or food production Animal L., 2, 123. Battery cages are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide; these cages reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, and increase rates of osteoporosis. In these systems and in free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled and killed at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens. It is estimated that an average consumer of eggs who eats 200 eggs per year for 70 years of his or her life is responsible for the deaths of 140 birds, and that an average consumer of milk who drinks 190 kg per year for 70 years is responsible for the deaths of 2.5 cows.

He married his first wife, Edith, then left her and took up with Hammond's mother, Hilda Blandford, by whom he also had two sons in England. He informally added \\"Hammond\\" to his name and they represented themselves as \\"Mr and Mrs Samuel H.

She was six months old when her family moved again, to Sydney, Australia. Her parents finally married in Sydney on 25 May 1927, the day after her 15th birthday, although there is no evidence Samuel's first wife had died by that time, or that they had ever divorced.Hardy, p. 22 Hammond attended Pymble Ladies' College and excelled in both sports and music.

She would often refer to Lady Gowrie as her \\"guardian angel\\". Hammond's fellow golfers in New South Wales raised enough money for her to leave Australia in 1936 to study in Vienna. She also studied with Dino Borgioli in London. She toured widely, and became noted particularly for her Puccini roles. She returned to Australia for concert tours in 1946, 1949 and 1953, and starred in the second Elizabethan Theatre Trust opera season in 1957. She undertook world concert tours between 1946 and 1961. Her autobiography, A Voice, a Life, was published in 1970. Dame Joan Hammond appeared in the major opera houses of the world ‚Äì the Royal Opera House, La Scala, the Vienna State Opera and the Bolshoi. Her fame in Britain came not just from her stage appearances but from her recordings. She made famous the aria \\"O mio babbino caro\\" from Puccini's opera Gianni Schicchi. Recorded in English under the title \\"O My Beloved Father\\", it earned Hammond a Gold Record award for 1 million sold copies on 27 August 1969.Hammond, p. 238 Her recording of \\"O, Silver Moon\\" from Dvo≈ô√°k's Rusalka was also a huge seller. A prolific artist, Hammond's repertoire also encompassed Verdi, Handel, Tchaikovsky, Massenet, Beethoven, as well as folk song, art song, and lieder. Later life A heart attack in 1965 forced Hammond to retire from the stage. Her final performance was at the funeral of her \\"guardian angel\\", Lady Gowrie, on 30 July 1965, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. This occasion was also memorable for the fact that Hammond was the first woman ever granted royal permission to sing in that chapel.Dame Joan Hilda Hood Hammond CBE CMG at White Hat Hammond retired to Australia. She became patron and a life member of the Melbourne-based Victorian Opera Company (since 1976, the Victorian State Opera ‚Äì VSO), founded in 1962 by Leonard Spira. She was the VSO's artistic director from 1971 until 1976 and remained on the board until 1985. Working with the then general manager, Peter Burch, she invited the young conductor Richard Divall to become the company's Musical Director in 1972.Richard Divall She joined the Victorian Council of the Arts, was a member of the Australia Council for the Arts opera advisory panel, and was an Honorary Life Member of Opera Australia. She was important to the success of both the VSO and Opera Australia. Hammond embarked on a second career as a voice teacher after her performance career ended. In 1975, she was appointed the head of the voice faculty at the Victorian College of the Arts, where she remained until her retirement seventeen years later in 1992. In that time she trained an extraordinary number of Australian singers who had successful careers in Australia and on the international stage. Among her notable pupils is soprano Cheryl Barker. In 1983, her home at Aireys Inlet was destroyed by the Ash Wednesday bushfires and she lost all her possessions including the memorabilia of a lifetime.White Hat .

He became one of the most renowned Eritrean artists (a Tigrinya singer). Biography Yemane's songwriting strove to reflect what he perceived to be Eritrean experience during the Eritrean War of Independence. His songs were dotted with stories of love, journey, hope, immigration, and liberation. In 1975, he was jailed for the perceived political interpretation of one of his songs. A few years after the declaration of the independence of Eritrea, Yemane moved to Asmara and continued to release albums that reflected the new era of hope and national prosperity, with a mixture of Eritrean melodies. He also sang about the people involved in the movement towards Eritrean independence, and the sacrifices of that movement. Yemane's songs are special in a way that they have a pattern with a recurring melancholic piece of melody. Yemane was also known as the 'Eritrean caretaker'.

She was the wife of Alexander (son of Polyperchon) and was highly distinguished for her beauty, talents, and energy. In 314 BC when her husband was assassinated at Sicyon, she assumed command of his forces, with whom her kindness had made her extremely popular. When the Sicyonians, hoping for an easy conquest over a woman, attacked the garrison to attempt to establishing an independent government, she quelled the sedition and crucified thirty of the rebels. Her victory held the town firmly in subjection under Cassander. However in 308 BC she was induced by Ptolemy, the ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt, to surrender Corinth and Sicyon. When Ptolemy took control of Corinth and Sicyon, Cassander's only remaining city in Greece was Athens. Cratesipolis was at Corinth at the time and she knew that her troops would never consent to the surrender, so she sent some of Ptolemy's forces into the town instead, pretending that they were a reinforcement that she ordered from Sicyon. She then withdrew with her troops to Patras in Achaea, where she was living. In 307 BC she had a noteworthy meeting with Demetrius Poliorcetes with whom she had a mutual admiration. Prior to this casual meeting, Demetrius pitched a tent near the city of Megara so that Cratesipolis could arrive unseen.

He started the famous pitch drop experiment there.  Education  Thomas Parnell was born in West Haddon, Northamptonshire, England and died in Indooroopilly in Brisbane, Australia. He was educated at St. John's College, in Cambridge, after winning a scholarship and received his B.A. in 1903. He received his M.A. from Cambridge in 1908.  Career  Parnell took up a tutoring position at Trinity College, at the University of Melbourne, between 1904 and 1911, with the hope that it would enable him to have time to pursue research, and then apply for a Fellowship position at the Cambridge. However his teaching duties in physics, mathematics and chemistry were so numerous, that he never had the time to dedicate to research. He elected to move to Brisbane with friend and future wife, Hermiene Ulrich, also a lecturer at the newly established University of Queensland. He lectured in physics at the University of Queensland between 1911 and 1918, and was a professor between 1919 and 1948. He enlisted in World War I as a private in the Australian Imperial Force in 1917, after having been in the Volunteers in England. He served as a gunner, often under the orders of his former students. He refunded his excess pay during the War, back to the University, to assist ex-servicemen planning on undertaking study. His wife, Hermiene returned to lecturing work during World War I, to assist the University. Parnell would begin his research into a high-precision method of measuring inductance in 1917. During 1922, he took part in an expedition to Goondiwindi to witness a total solar eclipse, and test Einstein's theory of relativity in this setting. In 1927 Parnell initiated an intriguing experiment to allow long-term observation of the behaviour of material known to have an extremely high coefficient of viscosity. Thus began his now famous pitch drop experiment, which, against all the odds, has been carefully preserved by UQ Physics to this day. Under his leadership the physics department developed a useful service role, both in providing a scientific base for the Queensland hospital system's X-ray and radium services, and establishing a radon laboratory. During World War II, Parnell organised a radio sounding station for the Radio Research Board, which assisted with short wave radio communications. Parnell was never able to return to full-time research, burdened by his numerous roles at the University. He was Chairman (1919‚Äì23) and Dean (1928‚Äì31 and 1935) of the Faculty of Science, a member (1932‚Äì35, 1938‚Äì44) of the Senate, and President (1938‚Äì44) of the Professorial Board. He was involved in the protracted negotiations that led to the creation (1933) of a massage school and the introduction (1937) of a diploma in physiotherapy. In 1935 he was a member of the planning committee for the faculty of medicine, and of a delegation to the Queensland Government that resulted in the establishment of a separate faculty of dentistry. While president of the Professorial board, Parnell represented the university on the Australian Vice- Chancellors' Committee. He was president of the Royal Society of Queensland (1928‚Äì29). In World War II he was a member of the Radio Research Board, the Queensland Cancer Trust, and the board of visitors of the Commonwealth Solar Observatory, Mount Stromlo, Australian Capital Territory. Survived by his wife and son, Parnell died of hypertensive cardiorenal failure on 1 September 1948 at Indooroopilly, Australia, and was cremated.  Legacy  A major building fronting the Great Court bears his name - the Parnell building. The physics department library which he had helped to establish was named the Parnell Memorial Library in 1948 and was eventually absorbed by the Dorothy Hill Engineering and Sciences Library at UQ in 1997. In October 2005 he was posthumously awarded the Ig Nobel prize for Physics for the pitch drop experiment, along with the experiment's then custodian, John Mainstone. He was survived by his wife and son, Thomas Meredith Parnell who would later become Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland.

It was established in 1889 as the official publication of the Historical Society of Japan (shigakkai) in Tokyo. It is published in Japanese with English abstracts. History of Shigaku zasshi and the Historical Society First edition of the Shigakkai zasshi. The Historical Society of Japan was founded on November 1, 1889 and began publishing a historical journal entitled Shigakkai zasshi (Journal of the Historical Society) on December 15 of that same year. In 1892 the name of the journal was changed to Shigaku zasshi. Two professors of history at Tokyo Imperial University, Shigeno Yasutsugu and Ludwig Rie√ü were instrumental in founding the society and beginning publication of the journal. Ludwig Rie√ü consciously modeled the journal on contemporary European historical journals such as the Historische Zeitschrift in Germany, the Revue Historique in France, and the English Historical Review in England. Shigeno Yasutsugu was also the only president of the Historical Society of Japan. He was president of the society from its founding in 1889 until his death in 1910. No successor has ever been appointed. Contents The journal consists of original research articles, reviews, and reports on academic trends in various fields. Although articles on Japanese and East Asian history are particularly well represented within the pages of this journal, articles on European and American history also have a visible presence. Articles devoted to topics outside of East Asia, Europe, and the US are relatively uncommon. May issue The annual May issue of Shigaku zasshi is of particular interest to historians trying to keep up with recent historiographic developments in Japan. The May issue is devoted to review articles summing up recent developments in the academic field of history within Japan. A general assessment of the work of the previous year in the field of history is summed up in the recurring section \\"Kaiko to tenb≈ç\\" (‚Äúreview and outlook‚Äù), and articles devoted to more specialized areas follow. Articles in the May issue are divided by (1) region (2) period and (3) thematic subject (such as \\"intellectual history\\" or \\"economic history\\"). While the sections for region and period are relatively stable, the sections for thematic subject often change from year to year. As an example of the geographic and chronological distribution of articles, the 2005 May issue contained 1 article on historiographic theory, 5 articles on Japan (divided by period), 9 articles on China (thinly divided by period), 1 article on Korea, 1 article on Central Asia, 1 article on Southeast Asia, 1 article on South Asia, 1 article on West Asia/North Africa, 1 article on Africa, 17 articles on Europe (divided by both period and country), and 2 articles on America (divided into North America and Latin America). May issues of Shigaku zasshi from 1949-1985 are also collected in the volume, Nihon rekishi gakkai no kaiko to tenb≈ç edited by the Historical Society of Japan and published in 1987 by Yamakawa Shuppansha.

It is located at the intersection of Dundas Street and Hurontario Street near the eponymous Cooksville Creek. History Cooksville was an important stage coach stop along the Dundas highway, which was carved out of the wilderness after a survey by Asa Danforth Jr. in 1798. The settlement was originally named Harrisville in honour of Daniel Harris, Cooksville's first settler, who immigrated from the United States in 1807. Later in 1836, the settlement was renamed to the present name Cooksville after Jacob Cook. The entrepreneur, Jacob Cook, won the contract to deliver the mail from York to Niagara, operated several stage coach lines, was the local magistrate and built the Cooksville House, the first licensed tavern in the area at the northwest corner of Dundas and Hurontario streets in 1829. A heritage Mississauga sign on Hurontario Street north of the intersection claims it was the first Canadian location of winemaking in 1836. Cooksville grew in size and influence until the Great Fire of 1852 razed much of it. A severe tornado hit the area on June 24, 1923 destroying mostly rural farmhouses around the town. On the west side of the town there was a 182 acre brickyard that sprawled south of the CP rail line from 1912 until its closure in 1995, employing many Cooksville residents over that period. The Italian Heavyweight champion boxer, Primo Carnera had worked at the yard for a short period during his youth. Today, the converted site is a medium density residential and retail zone along Shoreline Dr., just south of the infamous 1979 Mississauga train derailment site at the CP crossing (Mavis Road). Cooksville was the residence of HIH Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia while in exile in Canada. Much of the new suburban growth in Mississauga before amalgamation in the 1960s occurred in areas around Cooksville. For much of that time it had the highest concentration of high-rise condominium and rental buildings in Mississauga. In recent years it has been overtaken in density by the City Centre just to north of Cooksville and the area immediately surrounding the Square One Shopping Centre. Transportation Cooksville GO Station Cooksville is a main transportation hub in Mississauga, with GO Transit rail, and bus service; and express city buses to Toronto's Union Station. Cooksville GO Station, which is currently undergoing a large expansion (as of April 2020), is near the corner of Dundas Street and Hurontario Street, the original centre of Cooksville. Dundas Street, a five-lane road; and Hurontario Street, a six-lane road, are the main thoroughfares in Cooksville, and intersect at the heart of the community. Locally this intersection was known as, and still often referred to by locals as \\"five and ten\\" in reference to previous provincial roadway designations (Hwy. 5 for Dundas Street, Hwy. 10 for Hurontario Street). Demographics The population of the area is highly diverse, with people originating from all over the world. Over half of the population are visible minorities. There is a plethora of South Asian and Arab textile/clothing shops, restaurants, and grocery stores in the area. There is also a significant number of Afro-Caribbean take-out restaurants and barber shops; the area is known to cater towards Mississauga's black community because of the large number of barber shops in close proximity to one another. Nevertheless, the area is multicultural and most cultures are represented in the area. The census tracts for the area, include 3 separate neighbourhood designations by the City of Mississauga: Cooksville NHD (Neigbourhood), DT Cooksville (Downtown) and DT Hospital (site of the large Trillium Health Partners) Hospital. The area in the southwest part of Cooksville, closer to the Credit River, is a more exclusive enclave of mostly large, detached homes on larger, treed lots. It is colloquially referred to as Gordon Woods. Fairview is sometimes considered to be part of Cooksville, but is actually the neighbourhood located north of the CP rail line/Cooksville GO Station.http://www7.mississauga.ca/documents/business/2017/Population_Demographics_Housing.pdf References Neighbourhoods in Mississauga ","title":"Cooksville (Mississauga)"},{"id":"2857292","text":"Knomos is a workflow and knowledge management application primarily for law firms to handle their cases, with a focus on the legal systems of Europe.

A book-length essay drawing on Kincaid's experiences growing up in Antigua, it can be read as an indictment of the Antiguan government, the tourist industry and Antigua's British colonial legacy. The book, written in four sections, \\"combines social and cultural critique with autobiography and a history of imperialism to offer a powerful portrait of (post)colonial Antigua.\\" History and background In 1493, Christopher Columbus became the first European to visit Antigua on his second voyage. He named it Antigua after the Santa Maria de la Antigua, an icon found in Seville's cathedral. Sir Thomas Warner from England was able to colonize the island in 1632 by starting plantations that included tobacco and sugarcane. Warner also introduced slavery to the island. Slaves from West Africa worked on these plantations. Antigua became known as the English Harbourtown for its great location in the Caribbean. In 1834 slavery was finally abolished, but blacks' economic conditions failed to improve due to ‚Äúland shortages and the universal refusal of credit‚Äù.Kaufman, Will, and Heidi Slettedahl Macpherson. Britain And The Americas: Culture, Political, And History: A Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia. Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO, 2005. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). In her work, Jamaica Kincaid presents an anti-imperialist dialogue which is particularly critical of tourism and government corruption, both of which became prevalent after independence. She criticizes Antigua's dependence on tourism for its economy. Kincaid also mentions the damage caused by the 1974 earthquake, which destroyed many buildings. The author also explains how many people in office were charged with all forms of corruption. This social critique led to it being described as \\"an enraged essay about racism and corruption in Antigua\\" by one reviewer. Major ideas =Tourism as a neo- colonial structure= In the first section of A Small Place, Kincaid employs the perspective of the tourist in order to demonstrate the inherent escapism in creating a distance from the realities of a visited place. Nadine Dolby dissects the theme of tourism in A Small Place and places Kincaid's depiction of tourism in a globalized context that justifies Kincaid's strong feelings toward it.Dolby, Nadine. \\"A Small Place: Jamaica Kincaid and a Methodology of Connection.\\" Qualitative Inquiry 9.1 (2003): 57‚Äì73. Web. 1 December 2013. Dolby corroborates Kincaid's depiction of the tourist creating separation by \\"othering\\" the locale and the individuals that inhabit it. Furthermore, the tourist industry is linked to a global economic system that ultimately does not translate into benefits for the very Antiguans who enable it. The tourist may experience the beauty on the surface of Antigua while being wholly ignorant of the actual political and social conditions that the Antiguan tourism industry epitomizes and reinforces.Gauch, Suzanne. \\"A Small Place: Some Perspectives on the Ordinary.\\" Callaloo 25.3 (2002): 910-19. JSTOR. Web. 2 December 2013. Corinna Mcleod points out the disenfranchising nature of the tourism industry in its reinforcement of an exploitative power structure. In effect, the industry recolonizes Antigua by placing locals at a disenfranchised and subservient position in a global economic system that ultimately does not serve them.McLeod, Corinna. \\"Constructing a Nation: Jamaica Kincaid's A Small Place.\\" Small Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism 12.1 (2008): 77-92. Print. =Racism and legacies of colonialism= While Kincaid expresses anger towards slavery, colonialism and the broken Antiguan identity that it has left in its wake, she avoids retreating to simple racialization in order to explain the past and present, for doing so would further \\"other\\" an already marginalized group of people. Kincaid sheds light on the oppressive hierarchical structures of colonialism, which is still evident in the learned power structures of present-day, post-colonial Antigua. While she indeed acknowledges the justifications of oppression based on race in England's colonization of Antigua, she also attempts to transcend the notions of an inescapable racialized past. In doing so she attempts to shape readers‚Äô view of Antigua by creating a sense of agency. Critical reception =Positive= Kincaid's work has received mixed reviews, both positive and negative. Some of her overall reactions in the United States were characterized as immediate and enthusiastic. The anger that people felt from her attacking nature in her reading simultaneously lent certain strength to her argument about the postcolonial condition of the Antiguan people by manifesting itself as an authentic and emotional account. She uses her anger about the situation as a way to definitively inform readers about the postcolonial Antiguan daily life. Being an enraged essay focusing on racism and the effects of colonialism, some people account for the most consistent and striking aspect of her work to be what critic Susan Sontag calls her \\"emotional truthfulness\\". Sontag describes Kincaid's writing as \\"poignant, but it's poignant because it's so truthful and it's so complicated. ... She doesn't treat these things in a sentimental or facile way.\\" =Negative reception= In 1988, A Small Place was criticized as a vitriolic attack on the government and people of Antigua. New Yorker editor Robert Gottlieb refused to publish it. According to Jamaica Kincaid: Writing Memory, Writing Back to the Mother she was not only banned unofficially for five years from her home country but she voiced concerns that had she gone back in that time, she worried she would be killed. Jane King, in A Small Place Writes Back, declared that \\"Kincaid does not like the Caribbean very much, finds it dull and boring and would rather live in Vermont. There can really be no difficulty with that, but I do not see why Caribbean people should admire her for denigrating our small place in this destructively angry fashion.\\" Moira Ferguson, a feminist academic, argued that as \\"an African-Caribbean writer Kincaid speaks to and from the position of the other. Her characters are often maligned by history and subjected to a foreign culture, while Kincaid herself has become an increasingly mainstream American writer‚Äù References External links * College Literature * postcolonialweb.org 1988 essays Political literature Economy of Antigua and Barbuda Antigua and Barbuda literature British Leeward Islands History of Antigua and Barbuda Novels by Jamaica Kincaid African-American novels ","title":"A Small Place"},{"id":"2857303","text":"thumb Jesse H Turner Park is a public park in Memphis, Tennessee at the corner of South Parkway and Bellevue in South Memphis.

The museum had a flourishing publications department, producing books on aspects of colonial life such as the history of the Northern Rhodesia Police, and a register of titles of the regiments of the Honourable East India Company and East Indian Armies. The museum also held the collection of artefacts of the Commonwealth Institute; extensive photograph stills, paper, film and oral history archives, and a costume collection. These are now in the care of Bristol Museums, Galleries & Archives (apart from loans which were returned to their owners). The museum was also the home of the New World Tapestry. Unlike many national museums in Britain, the BECM was not publicly funded, but owned and operated by a charitable trust; consequently an admission charge was in place. Breaking the Chains  The museum's Breaking the Chains exhibition, funded by a ¬£1m Heritage Lottery grant to mark the 200-year anniversary abolition of the British Transatlantic Slave Trade by the Slave Trade Act 1807, was shortlisted for the Art Fund Prize. Closure and controversy On 23 November 2007 the museum announced it would be moving its core operations to London in 2008. The museum closed to the public in the autumn of 2008 and for school visits at the end of March 2009. On 16 March 2011, the Museums Association announced that the Director of the museum, Gareth Griffiths, had been dismissed pending a police investigation into the unauthorised disposal of museum objects. On 28 March 2012, the museum announced that the planned move to London had been cancelled and that it would instead give its collection to the City of Bristol to display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery at a future date. The Old Station which had previously housed the museum was also given to the city, and may be used for future Network Rail services to London. The unauthorised sale of hundreds of items from the museum's collection was the subject of a BBC One Inside Out programme on 10 December 2012. In a letter dated 22 May 2013, the museum wrote to one of the lenders of items, \\"Following a further extensive search for the items, I can now confirm that, unfortunately, we have only been able to locate one of the ten [items]... It is a matter of great regret that the Museum cannot locate the remaining items and I apologise on behalf of the Museum's trustees for this. I also confirm that the Museum has now completed the transfer of the artefacts it held to the British Empire & Commonwealth Trust (held by Bristol City Council) and the Museum has now moved out of its premises and it is proposed that the company which operates the Museum will be wound down in the near future, with an intention to enter a Members Voluntary Liquidation in July 2013.\\" On 24 October 2013, The British Empire and Commonwealth Museum and The Empire Museum Ltd were placed into \\"members' voluntary liquidation\\"; two employees of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bristol, were appointed joint liquidators. = Missing items = The following is a partial list. *Thomas Buttersworth's painting of the East India Company's Dunira, loaned by Lord Caldecote, was later discovered to have been sold at auction in 2008 without the owner's consent. * Bronze statuette of John Robert Godley donated by New Zealand. * Maori pare (carved lintel) donated by New Zealand. * Model pataka (store house) donated by New Zealand.

In January 1950, he was visited by a young man whose first name may have been George, three times over the course of a week. On the third occasion, Cox and \\"George\\" left the grounds of the academy and were never seen again. According to an eyewitness account from another cadet, the two men seemed to have known each other somewhere other than West Point. Cox is the only West Point cadet to have disappeared without a trace. Early life and military career Cox was born in Mansfield, Ohio. Author Harry Maihafer, who wrote a book about Cox's disappearance, wrote the following about his parents and family: > Richard Colvin Cox, son of Rupert F. and Minnie Colvin Cox, was the youngest > of six children. His father died when Richard was ten. (There had been > rumors of suicide, but actually his death resulted from an aggravated > diabetic condition. He'd been a practicing Christian Scientist; some said he > would have lived much longer had he received proper medical attention.) > Richard's mother, Mrs. Minnie Cox, was currently owner and operator of the > family business, the Rupert F. Cox Insurance Agency. During his high school years, Cox told a friend he did not have time to participate in athletic teams because he always had an after-school job. During summer vacations in his teen years, he worked full-time. While working on a road crew in Mansfield, he \\"fell and cut his arm badly on a scythe,\\" wrote Maihafer citing a witness who was interviewed by researcher Marshall Jacobs more than thirty years later. Cox immediately went home for help from his mother, who was a \\"Christian Science lay reader\\". She refused to call a doctor.\\"The cut became infected,\\" wrote Maihafer, \\"and later a woman who lived next door brought him to a doctor. As a result of the accident, [Cox] ended up with a prominent scar.\\" After graduating from a public high school in Mansfield in 1946, Cox volunteered for service in the United States Army. He joined the United States Constabulary, a United States Army Gendarmerie force raised to be a police-type occupation and security force in Allied-occupied Germany. In May 1947, he began his assignment to the Sixth Constabulary Regiment, based at Coburg in the American occupation zone in Germany.Maihafer, p.42. and was in the S-2 (intelligence) section of Headquarters Company. Later in 1947, Cox applied for and received his appointment to West Point, arriving at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School (then located at Stewart Field near the academy proper) in January 1948. Cox entered West Point in May 1948 and did well there. Academically, he was ranked at about 100 out of a class of 550. He joined West Point's athletic team and competed in a national NCAA competition only a month before his disappearance. Cox was engaged to be married; he and his fianc√©, Betty Timmons, planned to marry after his graduation from West Point. Disappearance At 4:45 pm on Saturday, January 7, 1950, a man telephoned Cox's West Point classmate, Peter Hains. Hains was acting as Charge of Quarters in Cadet Company B-2 (part of the North Barracks) and answered incoming calls for company members. He later said the caller's \\"tone was rough and patronizing, almost insulting.\\" After Hains told the man that Cox was not in his room, the man replied, \\"Well, look, when he comes in, tell him to come on down here to the hotel. ... Just tell him George called ‚Äì he'll know who I am. We knew each other in Germany. I'm just up here for a little while, and tell him I'd like to get him a bite to eat.\\" Hains later stated he could not be completely certain the name given was \\"George\\", as he had answered many phone calls while on duty and that one had not seemed noteworthy at the time; Cox never referred to the man by name. At 5:30 pm, a man entered Grant Hall - an area where cadets could meet guests‚Äîand asked to see Cox. The cadet on duty telephoned Cox to tell him he had a visitor. The cadet later described the visitor as slightly under tall and weighing around . He was fair-haired, had a fair complexion and wore a belted trench-coat, but no hat. When Cox entered the Hall, he shook hands with the man; the cadet on duty later recalled he seemed glad to see him. Cox signed out in the Company B-2 Departure Book, indicating he would have dinner off- campus. However, Cox later admitted to his roommates they did not dine, but drank from a bottle of whiskey while sitting inside the man's parked car. Cox returned to Cadet Company B-2, signed the Departure Book, took a shower, and slept off the effects of the alcohol (his two roommates later revealed this). As a prank, his roommates photographed him, slumped over his desk, asleep. At an indeterminate time that evening, Cox altered the military time he had written in the Departure Book, changing \\"1923\\" to \\"1823\\" to make it look as if he had attended the 6:30 pm cadet supper formation. In fact, he had skipped the formation. This detail was not discovered until two years later, when an agent of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command had the Departure Book examined in a laboratory. If the alteration had been discovered when it was fresh in January 1950, Cox could have been charged with violating the Cadet Honor Code and likely expelled. The next morning, before attending the Sunday chapel service, Cox mentioned his visitor to his roommates. The man, Cox said, was a former US Army Ranger who had served in the same unit as he had in Germany. Cox said the man liked to brag about killing Germans during the war and had boasted about cutting off their private parts afterward. Another story he told Cox was about having gotten a German girl pregnant, and then murdering her to prevent her from having the baby. That afternoon, Cox signed out a second time to meet the man, returning at about 4:30 pm. The following six days were without incident. Cox mentioned his visitor once to his roommates. He remarked that he \\"hoped he wouldn't have to see the fellow again,\\" giving them the impression he viewed the man with distaste. On Saturday, January 14, Cox watched a basketball game between the Army and Rutgers University. Afterwards, he was seen talking to a man thought to be \\"George,\\" although the cadet who saw the two talking gave a description that differed greatly from the description given by the cadet who had seen the stranger in Grant Hall on January 7. According to the eyewitness description from January 14, George was \\"dark-haired and rough looking.\\" Cox returned to his room and mentioned to a roommate he was signing out to dine with his visitor again, although he appeared \\"not apprehensive, just sort of disgusted.\\" The two men left the grounds of the academy and vanished without a trace. Official investigation Cox was supposed to return by 11 pm. When he did not return, no alarm was raised because cadets occasionally returned late. His continued absence was reported to a superior officer at 2:30 am, but again no action was taken as cadets had been known to stay out all night despite the punishment this would incur. On Sunday morning, his roommates reported all they knew of the matter to their superior; the New York State Police and the CID were informed. The FBI also became involved in the investigation. Three days after Cox's disappearance, a public appeal for information was broadcast on nearby radio stations. The grounds of West Point were intensively searched by helicopter and by troops on the ground. The Lusk Reservoir was dragged, the banks of the Hudson River were searched and a nearby pond was drained. The manhunt lasted two months but produced no significant leads. A search of Army records for a soldier who had served with Cox and matched the description of \\"George\\", only led to individuals who could not have been at West Point at the time of the disappearance. Cox's service in Germany was investigated and revealed nothing out of the ordinary. The theory that he had deliberately deserted from West Point was discounted, as he had left behind in his room $87 (equivalent to $ when adjusted for inflation) and two suits of civilian clothes. On March 15, 1950, Cox was listed as absent without leave. He was declared legally dead in 1957.  Jacobs investigation  Maihafer's book Oblivion (1996) documents the investigation conducted by Marshall Jacobs, a retired high school history teacher, of Cadet Richard Cox and his disappearance from West Point in January 1950. Jacobs began his research on the Cox disappearance in 1985. The more involved Jacobs became, the more intrigued he became with Cox and the prior inconclusive investigations. It was inconceivable to Jacobs that after 35 years this mystery had not been solved. During the ten years that passed between Jacobs beginning his investigation and Maihafer writing the book, A Current Affair telecast a segment about the Cox mystery on one of its episodes. The segment was anchored by Krista Bradford, who was seen interviewing Marshall Jacobs at his Miami, Florida home that had many boxes of files from his research. Bradford also interviewed a retired U.S. Coast Guard officer named Ernest J. Shotwell Jr., who said on- camera that he had had a conversation with Cox at the Washington, D.C. Greyhound Lines bus station two years after his disappearance. During the conversation between the two men who had been classmates at the USMA Preparatory School at Stewart Field and had not seen each other since then, Shotwell did not know Cox was a missing person. During the encounter at the bus station, Cox seemed \\"uncomfortable\\" and was vague about his plans for the immediate future. For ten years, Jacobs thoroughly investigated the case, traveling across the United States following up on new leads and revisiting old leads. He interviewed Cox's family, high school friends, military pals, and West Point classmates; CIA, FBI, and CID agents; and West Point and Army officials. He researched West Point's archives and the files from the FBI, CIA, and CID investigations of Cox's disappearance, to which he gained access under the Freedom of Information Act. Among Jacobs' findings was that authorities had been remiss when they had discounted the theory that Cox had disappeared deliberately. Jacobs came to believe that the presence of 87 dollars in Cox's shared room did not rule out the strong possibility that his visitor had helped him start a new career and life. The old leads Jacobs revisited included ones from a Mansfield News Journal reporter named Jim Underwood who had written a 12-installment series on the Cox mystery that the News Journal had published in 1982, costing the newspaper more than 18,000 dollars. Underwood had interviewed a high school acquaintance of Cox named Ralph E. Johns, who later in life was elected as juvenile and domestic relations judge in Mansfield, serving six years, and became \\"a driving force to encourage Mansfield to build and maintain a Juvenile Detention Center.\\"Legacy.com obituary of Ralph E. Johns Johns told Underwood that he had not been involved in the original investigation in the 1950s, but during that era \\"he and another Mansfield man, William McKee, grew very interested in the Cox case and had frequent contacts with local FBI officials. ... Johns also told Underwood that on one occasion, when discussing the Cox case with former FBI agent Vince Napoli, Napoli told him and McKee that the FBI had been within twenty-four hours of grabbing Cox, and he couldn't understand why the FBI would not let them pick him up or why they pulled them off the case. According to Underwood, Johns had speculated, perhaps based on Napoli's story, that Cox might have gone into some secret government agency such as the CIA.\\" In the late 1980s, Jacobs interviewed Johns, who confirmed that he had speculated about a secret government agency but it was only his speculation. When he was ready to reveal his findings, Jacobs, admittedly not a writer, contacted Maihafer with hopes they could collaborate on a book. They did and the Jacobs investigation is revealed in the book Oblivion. The book has a section with photos including the snapshot that Cox's roommates took of him on January 7, 1950 sleeping off the effects of the alcohol he had consumed in his visitor's parked car a very short time earlier.

It is located at White Cliffs, New South Wales, which was chosen as it has the highest insolation in New South Wales, and in 1981 when the station was constructed had no grid connection. Constructed by a team from Australian National University, the station consisted of fourteen five-metre parabolic dishes, each covered by more than 2000 mirrors and mounted on a heliostatic mounting. The dishes each focussed the sun's rays on a collector, where water was boiled. The resulting steam drove a three-cylinder Uniflow steam engine, made by modifying a Lister diesel engine, delivering up to 25kWe. Batteries were used to provide 24-hour power to selected buildings in the township, and an existing diesel generator retained to provide battery charging when either low insolation or strong winds prevented use of the solar station for extended periods. In 1996, following grid connection of the township, the station was converted to photovoltaic. The dishes were resurfaced, and the original collectors each replaced by a cluster of 16 water-cooled photovoltaic cells. In its new form, the station delivers up to 45kWe. The batteries, and diesel generator were removed, and the output fed into the grid. The grid connected power station ran for around 6 years, generating valuable data on the long- term performance and efficiency of the modules. The power station ceased operation in December 2004 and has been resumed by the owner of the site. In 2006 Engineers Australia placed a heritage marker \\"recognising the engineering significance of what is arguably considered the world's first commercial solar power station\\". In 2012 it was proposed the site be used as a museum.

Ferruccio Lamborghini intended the name to recall the fighting bulls bred in Jarama river area in Spain and not the Jarama racing circuit near Madrid. Ferruccio Lamborghini with a Jarama (left) and a Lamborghini built tractor (right) History Early Jarama instrument panel and steering wheel Early Jarama rear view, showing Miura-style knock off magnesium wheels In 1970 Lamborghini designed the Islero to meet the demand of the American market. When it came time to replace it, instead of just redesigning the Islero, Lamborghini instead made the Jarama, filling the spot which would have been taken by a second generation of the Islero. Introduced in 1970 at the Geneva Motor Show, Lamborghini built the Jarama to meet U.S. standards using a version of the Espada chassis that had had its wheelbase shortened by 10.7 inches. The Iso Lele and the Lamborghini Jarama share similarities in their exterior styling and were both styled by Marcello Gandini. A total of 328 Jaramas were built. The Jarama weighed dry, heavier than the Islero. It is powered by the same 3.9 L (3,929 cc) Lamborghini V12 engine used in the Islero and Espada, which was heavily derived from the engine used in the earlier 400 GT. The engine was fitted with six Weber 40 DCOE carburetors and sent power to the rear wheels through a 5-speed manual transmission. The original Jarama (1970‚Äì1973) model was claimed to produce . Early Jaramas featured center-locking magnesium alloy wheels, as used on the Miura and S1/S2 Espadas. = Jarama S = The Jarama S (also known as Jarama GTS) was introduced in 1972. The exhaust system, heads and carburetors were revised, resulting in a power increase to . The S featured a few minor body modifications including a hood scoop, exhaust vents in the fenders, windshield position adjustments and relocated turn signals. New wheels on 5-bolt hubs were used, identical to those used on the Series 3 Espada. The interior now had redesigned dashboard trimmed in aluminium, switches relocated to the center console, added head/sound insulation and improved rear seats and legroom. Power assisted steering became standard early into Jarama S production. Removable roof panels, and a Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic transmission were also available as factory options. Lamborghini built 150 of this version. Ferruccio Lamborghini's personal Jarama S is on display at the official Lamborghini museum at the company's factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy. The Jarama was Mr. Lamborghini's favorite model. He stated in a 1991 interview \\"I preferred the Jarama to all the others, because it is the perfect compromise between the Miura and the Espada.\\"  Jarama Rally  Lamborghini Jarama Rally and Lamborghini Miura P400 Jota The Jarama Rally, also known as the Jarama \\"Bob\\", is a one-off, race modified Jarama built by Lamborghini's test driver Bob Wallace. It features a modified 3.9-liter V12 engine that was repositioned to sit farther back in the engine bay. This allowed it to achieve a nearly 50/50 weight distribution (the standard Jarama had 53/47 weight distribution). The engine produces at 8,000 rpm, more than stock, and could reportedly reach a top speed of 270 km/h (167.7 mph) and accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in about 5 seconds. As a race-ready example, Bob Wallace built the car from a bare shell, re-welding it where needed for stiffness and fitting a lightweight steel rear roll cage. He also upgraded the Jarama with a heavily modified aluminum body, which got rid of, amongst other things, the Jarama's hinged headlights and plastic discs, allowing the car to be around lighter than stock at an estimated . It also featured center locking Miura wheels and low back seats, Koni racing shock absorbers, and a stripped out interior. The orange and black painted vehicle never ended up participating in any races. The car was reportedly restored in the UK in 1990 after being discovered in Saudi Arabia.

He is an alumnus of Reed College and the University of California, Santa Cruz. Packard is known for his contributions to both chaos theory and cellular automata. He also coined the phrase \\"the edge of chaos\\".Packard, Norman, \\"Adaptation Toward the Edge of Chaos\\", 1988Bass, Thomas A., The Predictors, 1999, Henry Holt Publishing, p. 138 Biography Between 1976 and 1981, he worked with fellow graduate students in Santa Cruz, California, forming the Eudaemons collective with J. Doyne Farmer and others, to develop a strategy for beating the roulette wheel using a toe-operated computer. The computer could, in theory, predict in what area a roulette ball would land on a wheel, giving the player a significant statistical advantage over the house. Although the project itself was a success, they ran into great practical difficulty employing the technique on-site in Las Vegas casinos, and many of the members left to pursue other fields of academia. The experiences of Norman, Doyne Farmer, and crew were later chronicled in the book The Eudaemonic Pie (1985) by Thomas Bass. Their experience was also chronicled on the television series \\"Breaking Vegas.\\" Around the same time, he formed the Dynamical Systems Collective with friends Rob Shaw, Doyne Farmer, and James Crutchfield. The collective was best known for its work in probing chaotic systems for signs of order. In 1982, Packard left Santa Cruz for France to take a post-doctoral fellowship at the Institut des Hautes √âtudes Scientifiques in Bures-sur- Yvette, France.

The character's debut on-screen was broadcast on 14 January 2001. He was introduced as part of the Grimshaw family, formed around the established character Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). Todd was the programme's first gay character which generated much coverage in the British media. The coming out storyline was credited for helping Coronation Street portray a more accurate depiction of society in the 21st century. The character's storylines have mainly focused on his relationships with Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien), Karl Foster (Chris Finch), Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) and Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank). Langley decided to leave the show in 2004 but returned for brief appearances in 2007 and 2011. The actor agreed to reprise the role on a permanent basis in 2013. Todd remained a part of the series until Langley's contract was terminated following an accusation of sexual assault against him in 2017, to which he later pleaded guilty. It was announced in July 2020 that Todd was to return, with the role having been recast to Pierce; Todd returned on 9 October 2020. Development =Family= The Grimshaws are often portrayed as arguing rivals in their scenes. Todd and his eldest brother Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) are portrayed as \\"bickering brothers\\". Jason is often cheeky to their mother, Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver). Thomas told a reporter from Soaplife that he and Langley were best friends off- screen. =Early relationships= Todd begins a relationship with Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), before romancing Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien). She later ends their relationship because she wants to date Aidan \\"Ade\\" Critchley (Dean Ashton). Langley and O'Brien were in a relationship and she told Frances Traynor from the Daily Record that acting out their break-up was not strange. Todd then resumes his previous relationship with Candice. But Todd soon returns to Sarah. She decides to sleep with Todd on her sixteenth birthday. The storyline was controversial and nine viewers contacted the Independent Television Commission. The organisation investigated the scenes and cleared Coronation Street of breaching guidelines. They praised them for building a relationship between the two characters and viewed it as a mature decision. Prior to this, Langley's friends would tease him because Todd was a virgin. O'Brien told Steve Hendry from the Sunday Mail that Sarah is \\"a bit dependent on Todd\\". In June 2003, Alex Tate from The People reported that Sarah-Louise would dump Todd. Sarah fears that she and Bethany are preventing Todd from succeeding at Oxford University. But Sarah and Todd move into a flat together. Sarah's daughter Bethany Platt (Amy and Emily Walton) electrocutes herself and Todd finds her unconscious. The accident prompts Gail Platt (Helen Worth) to involve social services. =Sexuality= In March 2003, Polly Graham from the Sunday Mirror reported that executive producer Kieran Roberts wanted Todd to become the show's first gay character. The show confirmed that had discussed the possibility but nothing has been decided upon. On 22 August 2003, it was reported that Todd would befriend Sarah's brother, Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickett) and kiss him. However, Nick does not reciprocate. A show spokesperson said that the storyline was a \\"groundbreaking move\\" and predicted a varied and \\"huge reaction\\" from viewers. They told a reporter from the Liverpool Echo that Todd had always questioned his sexuality. They added that \\"the storyline came naturally out of the character. It is being handled extremely sensitively.\\" In October a spokesperson commented that \\"this is just the start. It's not a case of having a gay kiss just for titillation's sake. Todd will continue to struggle with his feelings, not for Nick, but general confusion over his sexuality.\\" Approximately fourteen million viewers watched the kiss and sixteen complaints were filed. Todd kissed Karl Foster (Chris Finch) and began an affair. The decision was made to film the scenes in the center of Manchester's Gay Village, Canal Street. As the kiss was filmed revelers on the street cheered at the actors. Langley was worried about portraying the issue led story correctly. He told Billy Sloan of the Sunday Mail that the crowd approval made him believe he was doing in right. Filming inside the street's nightclubs was carried out while actual drinkers were having their nights out. Thirty extras were hired to make the clubs look busier. Langley thought the location shoot was advantageous because \\"it gave you a real feeling of the atmosphere. It was very different from being on the normal Corrie set.\\" A spokesperson added that it was the beginning of Todd's realisation about his sexuality. While kissing Karl; Todd sees Sarah approaching and is \\"mortified\\", but she fails to notice Todd and Karl's kiss. The storyline sparks a fight between Eileen and Gail. Eileen attacks Gail after she brands Todd a \\"two-timing, twisted, lying pervert\\". The two proceed to pull each other's hair out in the street. =Departure (2004)= In May 2004, it was announced that Langley had decided to leave Coronation Street. He stated that he had spent happy years with the show but felt it was the correct time to leave. Producers did not expect Langley to leave and had planned his sexuality storyline for two years in advance. They were shocked by the actor's decision to leave and had to revise the storyline to facilitate Langley's impending departure. They decided not to kill Todd making it possible for Langley to reprise the role. Todd decides to leave Weatherfield when he discovers Jason and Sarah in bed together. The show's producer Tony Wood added that Langley \\"has been an asset to the show and his portrayal of the sexually confused Todd has been superb.\\" Daran Little, who wrote Todd's coming out storyline, told Daniel Martin and Jason Deans from The Guardian that he wanted to create a spin-off show focusing on Todd living in London. Langley was asked to return various times but could not because of other work commitments. =Returns= In 2007, Langley returned to the show to film fifteen episodes as Todd. Langley said that he would return again because he enjoyed filming scenes with the Grimshaw family. In 2009, Thomas asked the new producer Kim Crowther if she would reintroduce the character. Langley reprised his role as Todd for two short stints in 2007 and 2011. On 30 January 2011, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy revealed that Todd would return to Coronation Street. A spokesperson told Kilkelly that \\"we are currently in negotiations with Bruno Langley about a short storyline.\\" Langley was on a theatre tour when asked to return. He split his time between Leeds and Manchester filming for Todd's reappearance, which lasted one episode broadcast on 24 April 2011. Despite the single episode return, Langley filmed over five days and decided to convey that Todd had changed. But he noted that Todd \\"is essentially the same guy ‚Äì he's just grown up.\\" Todd returns to visit Eileen and introduces her to his new boyfriend Jools Creme (Ben Allen). Langley told Kilkelly that Todd and Jools must be in a serious relationship because Todd has never introduced a boyfriend to his family. Jools is middle-class and Todd had been treated as a guest at posh parties. Langley explained that Todd is nervous because residents of Weatherfield are completely different from Jools. It was also revealed that Gail would not welcome Todd's return and brands him a \\"gay gold-digger\\". =Reintroduction= On 17 August 2012, Langley revealed that he would like to return to the show. On 5 June 2013, it was announced that the character would be returning to Coronation Street, with Langley returning as a regular cast member. Executive producer Stuart Blackburn told an itv.com reporter that \\"Todd is a much loved character who has real history on the show and his return will leave Eileen with some impossible choices.\\" Langley said it was a great time to reprise the role and explore how Todd has changed whilst living in London. He added that he was happy to see the Grimshaw family reunited. Langley returned to filming on 27 August and his first scenes aired on 4 November 2013. Nick Owens from the Daily Mirror reported that Todd's return would see him attempt to ruin Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) and Maria Connor's (Samia Ghadie) relationship. Upon his return Todd is played as a manipulative liar. Langley told Mark James Lowe from All About Soap that Todd had a job and a boyfriend in London but soon lost everything. Todd behaved badly and \\"burnt his bridges\\" with those he knew. When Todd arrives back he is untruthful with his family. His ex-boyfriend Alex Hughes (Nathan Ives-Moiba) arrives claiming that Todd has stolen his money. Langley explained that Todd does not like being exposed as a liar because he enjoys Eileen viewing him as the \\"better son\\". The actor told David Brown from Radio Times that Todd is concerned about the way Eileen views him, but does not care what other residents think. Todd has no worries about seeing Nick (now played by Ben Price) and Gail again, but upon doing so he is confronted with his past. The change of behavior continues as Todd manipulates Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) into convincing Eileen to ask him to stay. Langley explained that Todd \\"knows that Sean fancies him so he uses that against him. He manipulates Sean into speaking to Eileen and his plan works. Eileen wants him to stay, which makes Todd very pleased with himself.\\" Langley also confirmed reports that Todd would attempt to steal Marcus away from Maria. He added that Todd would manipulate and use Sean in his efforts to impress and attract Marcus. But Maria is unaware of Todd's intentions towards her partner. Of Todd's motives, Langley said that \\"he likes a challenge and I guess he‚Äôs probably one of those people who likes the drama of splitting couples up. It‚Äôs all for his own ego and just to prove that he can.\\" The actor was happy with Todd's changed personality. He noted that Todd spent years living away from home and it would have been a bad decision for him to return exactly the same person. Todd's manipulation of Sean is soon exposed by Brian Packham (Peter Gunn). Todd reveals that he could never be attracted to Sean and Brian informs him. To gain revenge Todd exposes secrets to his girlfriend Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh). Langley told a reporter from New! that \\"[Todd] was really angry so [he] decided to wreck his relationship with Julie.\\" =Affair with Marcus Dent= In January 2014, the storyline between Todd and Marcus (played by Charlie Condou) was developed. Marcus is a gay male in a relationship with a female. He has not acted on his attraction to men while with Maria. However, Todd has a birthday party which Marcus attends and Todd uses the opportunity to gain his attention. Todd manipulates the situation by taking his shirt off in-front of Marcus. Condou told David Brown from Radio Times that Todd is \\"very flirtatious\\" and his handsome looks do not go unnoticed by Marcus. He was \\"turned on\\" by Todd but also upset about it. Todd takes his plan further by getting Marcus alone to kiss him. Eileen interrupts them and Todd admits that he tried instigate a kiss. Condou added that Todd controls the situation and knows exactly what to say to his advantage. This leaves Marcus \\"conflicted\\" because he loves Maria and Todd is \\"bad for him\\", but he cannot keep away. Condou told Allison Jones from Inside Soap that \\"He's trying to tell himself his feelings for Todd aren't a big thing, but Todd‚Äôs like a dog with a bone and when he wants something he won‚Äôt let go. He knows what he wants and he‚Äôs going to get it.\\" Langley explained that Todd made an effort to behave cunningly, choosing to loiter around Coronation Street to keep an eye on Marcus. Todd does not care about the consequences and has his sights set firmly on Marcus. Langley explained that his character does not consider Maria's feelings because he has a \\"warped\\" view that he is doing Marcus and Maria a favour: he believes that Marcus will eventually decide to be with another man and believes it should be himself. Todd also claims to be in love and lets local gossip Sean know, playing a game of manipulation, knowing Marcus will hear of it. Langley further explained Todd's motives: \\"I think Todd has a reason for doing what he's doing. Todd was going to marry Sarah and have children, but he knew it wasn't right [...] he can see the same pattern happening with Marcus, so Todd is quite adamant when he tells Marcus that he's doing the wrong thing.\\" The Daily Star later released photographs obtained during location filming depicting Marcus chasing after Maria. Reporter Nicole Morley revealed that Maria would catch Todd and Marcus sharing a shirtless embrace. =Departure (2017)= In October 2017, a woman complained to ITV that Langley had acted inappropriately towards, and sexually assaulted her, in a Manchester bar. After an internal investigation into the sexual assault allegation made by the woman, Langley's contract with Coronation Street was terminated with immediate effect. His last appearance was on 22 December 2017. On 30 October 2017, police confirmed that Langley had been charged with two counts of sexual assault, to which he pleaded guilty on 28 November 2017. =Reintroduction and recast= On 12 July 2020, it was announced that Coronation Street producers were beginning to look at a new actor to portray Todd. Todd returned on 9 October 2020 played by Gareth Pierce. Storylines = 2001‚Äì2004 = Highly academic, Todd is poised to sit A-Levels until he gets involved with teenage mother, Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien), with whom he falls in love, leaving thoughts of university behind in favour of domesticity; much to his mother's dismay. Sarah becomes pregnant with Todd's baby, her second, at the age of sixteen. However, changes begin to show in Todd when he becomes infatuated with Sarah's older brother, Nick Tilsley (Adam Rickett). After a night out, Todd kisses a sleeping Nick, who wakes up and rebuffs him. Although Nick remains convinced that Todd is gay and insists that Sarah finish her relationship with him, Todd is able to pass the incident off as a misguided moment of drunken confusion. However, he later secretly embarks on a relationship with gay nurse, Karl Foster. They sleep together in Sarah's bed and Todd admits that he enjoys sneaking around behind Sarah's back. Karl ends their relationship when Todd refuses to break up with Sarah, wanting to have Sarah and his child at home and Karl as his \\"bit on the side\\". Todd then comes out as gay to Sarah. Sarah then suffers a placental abruption, caused by a pre-existing medical condition, and goes into premature labour. She has an emergency caesarean section and their son Billy is born, leaving them both on the critical list. Todd shows little concern for Sarah's wellbeing during this time and is only interested in Billy, demanding that Sarah take him to see him. Billy dies 24 hours after his birth and tensions escalate between the Platts and Grimshaws. Todd comes to terms with his sexuality, resumes his studies and is accepted to Oxford University. However, when Todd catches Sarah and his brother Jason together, he lashes out at Sarah, slapping her and throwing her out then fighting with Jason. In the aftermath, Todd moves to London and tells Sarah he hopes she finds someone who loves her as much as he did. = 2007‚Äì2011 = Todd returns three years later for Jason's stag party. He tells Eileen he is in an open relationship with a man named Ben and has obtained his law degree and is doing temporary work. Jason informs Todd that Sarah's younger brother David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) sent Todd's invitation after forging Jason's handwriting. Todd is hurt as he thinks he has finally been accepted by Jason again, and is mortified about being tricked into returning. Before he can depart, Todd and Sarah cross paths when she arrives at the house and they argue. However, Jason convinces Sarah that Todd should stay otherwise David will have won. After Sarah throws a tantrum following Jason and Todd's drunken behaviour at the stag do, Todd confronts her and tells her to stop being selfish. They argue but work things out and promise to lay the past to rest. Todd attends the wedding and returns to London soon after. Todd later visits the street with his new wealthy boyfriend Jools and introduces him to Eileen. Eileen and Todd argue because he is ashamed of his working-class background. He leaves after making his apologies. = 2013‚Äì2017 = Todd loses his job as a lawyer and returns to Weatherfield but fails to inform Eileen. A man named Alex then arrives and reveals Todd has stolen his money, cheated on Jools and is unemployed. Eileen is upset with Todd's lies but he manipulates Sean into helping reaffirm his place in the Grimshaw household. Todd enjoys causing trouble for Brian who has been keeping secrets from Julie. This annoys Marcus but Todd manipulates the situation and gains his trust. Todd tries to cause tension with Marcus and Maria, later attempts to kiss him but Eileen interrupts. Todd refuses to listen to her warnings revealing that he sees sleeping with Marcus as a challenge. He begins to disrupt Marcus and Maria's relationship and spends more time with them. Todd spreads a rumour that he is in love and Marcus becomes jealous. They sleep together, but Marcus warns Todd off, so Todd continues to manipulate him. He sets up a scenario in which Maria will catch them being intimate. Maria throws Marcus out, leaving Todd free to pursue Marcus for himself. Todd later starts a relationship with vicar Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) and they foster a child, Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman), the daughter of Billy's ex-boyfriend who passed away. Todd left Weatherfield in December 2017 and went on the run after assaulting a police officer. = 2020 = In 2020, Sean, Billy and Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) read a letter meant for Eileen (who is currently visiting Jason in Spain) supposedly from Todd, asking for ¬£1,000. They agree to go ahead with his plan but they discover that it was in fact a women called Safia (Sofiya Limalia) who admins that she wrote the letter and that she is scamming them. This promotes Billy and Sean to begin searching for Todd, and they give an interview. Eventually after Eileen returned from Spain when visiting Jason, Todd gets in contact, leaving a note in Eileen‚Äôs house to tell her to meet her at an old warehouse on Water Street, and the two meet up, but the reunion is cut short when they are cornered by gangster Mick Chaney (Neil Ball), who demands that Todd come with him. Todd however hits him over the head, and he and Eileen run. When Eileen is called in to identify a dead body, Todd begs her to say that it him. At she at first agrees, but does not go through with it. Todd confronts Eileen and tells her that he only owes Mick ¬£1,000, and he leaves, saying that he has signed his death warrant. Mary (to whom Eileen has confessed that she has been in contact with Todd) and George Shuttleworth (Tony Maudsley) the son of the late undertaker Archie Shuttleworth (Roy Hudd) stage a fake funeral for Todd, inviting Mick to the service, however Mary and George are unconvinced and Eileen calls an end to the farce. Mick follows Eileen home and reveals that he is Todd‚Äôs ex. They discover that Todd is in the house and Mick takes out a gun, threading to shoot Eileen unless he follows, which he does, however when they leave Gary Windass (Mikey North) hits Mick over the head with a baseball bat in the garden. Reception In 2003, a survey was conducted to determine which fictional characters British landlords were like their tenants. 35% of landlords chose Todd and Sarah who represented teenagers struggling to pay rent. A reporter from Hello! magazine has branded Todd a \\"unlucky-in-love, relationship-challenged\\" character whose life is blighted with problems. A Virgin Media writer branded him a \\"sensitive hunk\\". Peter Dyke and Katie Begley from the Daily Star touted him as the \\"gay hunk\\". A writer from Orange branded him the \\"beacon of benevolence\\". A reporter from the Daily Record opined that Todd kissing Nick sent \\"Coronation Street crashing into the 21st century\\". They added that they were surprised that it took forty-three years to feature a same sex kiss. Rachael Tinniswood of the Liverpool Echo was not impressed with the \\"unrealistic\\" storyline. She said that \\"poor Todd\\" had \\"homosexuality foisted upon\\" him in a \\"sad attempt\\" to gain viewers. Brian Roberts from the Daily Mirror believed that Todd was \\"out of the closet once and for all\\" when he kissed Karl in Canal Street. He branded the show's first gay kiss as a mere peck in comparison to the second. Inside Soap ran an opinion poll asking readers whether or not they felt Todd's gay storyline was overdue or too taboo for television. 63 per cent voted that it was about time the show covered the topic. In 2014, an Inside Soap writer branded him a \\"wily man-hunter\\". A fellow writer named him a \\"manipulative fella\\" and \\"scheming man-stealer\\". Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror questioned whether Todd was attempting to become the show's \\"new devil child\\". She observed his behavior to be that of a \\"boy poking a wasp's nest with a big stick.\\" A writer from TV Magazine said that Todd would stop at nothing to get Marcus, top rated his cunning behaviour and branded him a \\"rotter\\". In August 2017, Langley and Brocklebank were longlisted for Best Partnership at the Inside Soap Awards. They did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist.

His work lay in the King's Household and in the control of the State Affairs of Scotland and he was the King's chief Scottish advisor. With the full backing and trust of King James he travelled regularly from London to Edinburgh via Berwick-upon-Tweed. In Scotland Home was the third son of Sir Alexander Home of Manderston, Berwickshire, by his spouse Janet, daughter of George Home of Spott. He was introduced, at the age of 26, to the Court of sixteen-year-old James VI by a relative, Alexander Home, 6th Lord Home. Establishing himself as a favourite, he was in the retinue which accompanied King James VI to Norway and Denmark to collect his future Queen. James Melville of Halhill mentions that Home did not sail with the king, but in one of three other ships, along with Lewis Bellenden, John Carmichael, the Provost of Lincluden, William Keith of Delny, James Sandilands, and Peter Young.Thomas Thomson, James Melville Memoirs of his own life (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 372 During the trip, James VI made him Keeper of the Royal Wardrobe and sacked William Keith of Delny, who had appeared in richer clothing than himself.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 478. In 1606, when making him Earl of Dunbar, James VI praised him for his tact and diplomacy in Denmark at this time, his \\"high prudence and rare discretion.\\"HMC 5th Report: M. E. Stirling of Renton (London, 1876), p. 648 \\"summa prudentia et rara taciturnitas\\".

In the 1590s Home presided over an arrangement where clothes and textiles for the royal households were provided by the goldsmith Thomas Foulis and merchant Robert Jousie, partly financed by money sent as a gift or subsidy to James VI by Queen Elizabeth.Jemma Field, 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590‚Äì1603', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019), p. 154. Home had a role in financing the household of Anne of Denmark giving her ¬£3833 Scots in 1591, and in 1592 a dividend of ¬£4000 from her dowry which had been invested in various Scottish towns. He was in charge of paying her Danish servants who were owed fees by the Scottish exchequer, totalling ¬£1,200 in 1592.George Powell McNeill, Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, vol. 22 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 153, 199, 232. In November 1592 Home was identified with friends of the Duke of Lennox, Colonel William Stewart, the Laird of Dunipace, Thomas Erskine, and James Sandilands, as a supporter of the king's former favourite James Stewart, Earl of Arran, working for his rehabilitation to the disadvantage of the Chancellor, John Maitland and the Hamilton family. The English diplomat Robert Bowes called this group the \\"four young and counselling courtiers.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 819, 821. In December 1592 he rode with Sir John Carmichael with news of the crisis caused by the discovery of the Spanish blanks to Alloa Tower, where James VI and Anna of Denmark were celebrating the wedding of the Earl of Mar and Marie Stewart.Thomas Thomson, The historie and life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), p. 260. In November 1593 Anna of Denmark complained that people around the king were speaking disrespectfully of her. James asked Home to be watchful of the queen's honour. Robert Bowes wrote that Home himself was suspected of speaking against the queen, and Burghley endorsed this, adding \\"The wolf to be a watchman.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 230-1. Home was involved in the preparations for the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle in 1594. He was given ¬£4,000 Scots from the queen's dowry which had been invested with Perth town council. The money was for mending the royal tapestries, making tablecloths for the banquets and the desks in the chapel, and upholstering stools and chairs. The tapestries were repaired by George Stachan or Strathauchin and William Beaton, the court embroiderer, made the other items.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 145.: National Records of Scotland E35/13. With the king, at Linlithgow Palace, he interviewed a woman from Nokwalter in Perth, Christian Stewart, who was accused of causing the death of Patrick Ruthven by witchcraft. She confessed she had obtained a cloth from Isobel Stewart to bewitch Patrick Ruthven. She was found guilty of witchcraft and burnt on Edinburgh's Castlehill in November 1596.Robert Pitcairn, Ancient Criminal Trials (Edinburgh, 1833), pp. 399-400. In 1598 he was appointed a Privy Counsellor, and the following year appears as Sheriff of Berwick-upon-Tweed, (by then in England). In October 1600 James VI visited his house at Spott and was banqueted. The \\"merry\\" party included Sir Robert Ker, the Duke of Lennox, Sir Thomas Erskine, and Sir David Murray. The English courtier Roger Aston noted that all the gentlemen of the chamber there were \\"inward\\" with one another and with Home, who was the most \\"inward\\" with the king. Aston took the opportunity to ride to Berwick-upon-Tweed to see his friends.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 720, 722-3. In 1601 he was made Master of the King's Wardrobe, and on 31 July the same year was appointed one of the Componitors to the Lord High Treasurer, and acceded to that position in September. In 1601 he was also made Provost of Dunbar. In England Upon James's accession as James I of England in 1603, Home accompanied his sovereign to Westminster, where he became Chancellor of the Exchequer (and ex officio the Second Lord of the Treasury) from 1603 to 1606. In 1603 he was also appointed to the Privy Council of England, and on 1 June that year received a grant as Keeper of the Great Wardrobe for life. On 7 July 1604 he was created Baron Hume of Berwick in the Peerage of England. In 1605 he was appointed a Knight of the Garter, and on 3 July was created Earl of Dunbar in the Peerage of Scotland. There is evidence that he took a part in the interrogation of Guy Fawkes in the immediate aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. =Queen Elizabeth's jewels and clothes= King James quickly disposed of much of Queen Elizabeth's jewellery, either by selling it, having it remade, or exchanging it for new pieces. George Home was involved in examing the old queen's jewels which were brought to Hampton Court at Christmas time 1603 by Sir Thomas Knyvett. The King, Home, Roger Aston and the Earl of Nottingham selected pirces for disposal and sent them to the goldsmiths John Spilman and William Herrick, including a remarkable clock in the form of glass woman studded with rubies emerals and pearls.

In July 1606 the earl's office of keeper of the wardrobe in Scotland was given to Sir James Hay, then a gentleman of the king's bedchamber. Dunbar was receipted for jewels held in the Tower of London and elsewhere, including; the ruby and chain from the (dismantled) pendant called the \\"Great H of Scotland\\", a hat badge with the monogram \\"J.A.R\\" in diamonds with three pendant pearls, a gold ring with five diamonds and clasped hands called the \\"espousal ring of Denmark\\", a band for hat with 23 links including six pieces with letters made of diamonds, and a diamond cross, which had been brought from Scotland for their value and significance.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 327-330: Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1816), pp. 207-8. Sir Charles Stanhope recorded an anecdote that the Earl of Dunbar had made ¬£60,000 from sales of clothes from the wardrobe of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and spent ¬£20,000 on the house he built on the site of Berwick Castle.G.

George Chaworth wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury in 1607 about the various reports of its size, height, views, and good proportions and that its long gallery would make that at Worksop Manor look like a garret or attic. Worksop had been built by Shrewsbury's father.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), pp. 214-5 Landed interests Of these, on 27 September 1603 Home received the manor and castle of Norham, with its fishing rights on the River Tweed. On 12 December a Royal Charter gave him the custody and captaincy of the Castle of St Andrews. In July 1605 he had a confirmation of all the lands previously granted to him incorporated and combined into a free earldom, Lordship of Parliament, and Barony of Dunbar. Religious affairs In 1608, Home journeyed to Scotland with George Abbot to arrange to promote the Episcopal Church, and to seek some sort of union between the Church of England and Church of Scotland. King James was pleased with the initial results, although the hoped-for Union never occurred and the gulf between the King and the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland widened. In July 1605 some nineteen ministers assembled at Aberdeen in defiance of the King's prohibition against the General Assembly meeting. Six of them were subsequently imprisoned in Blackness Castle near Linlithgow, and there, on 10 January 1606, the Earl of Dunbar came from London to be present at their trial and to act as the assessor. Everything was done that could be done by him to win a verdict for the King against the six ministers and it is said that he \\"brought plenty of money with him to purchase a verdict\\". In addition, the Earl himself selected the 15 jurymen, five of whom were Homes, his relatives. But even then the jury could not agree. In the end it was a majority verdict of nine against six in favour of the guilty verdict. Regardless of the irregularities, the verdict stood, and established the law that it was High Treason for any minister of the Established Church to dispute the authority of the King and the Privy Council in religious matters. Family In 1590 he married Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of Alexander Gordon of GightSome sources call this laird of Gight \\"George Gordon\\", see Duncan Forbes,Ane account of the familie of Innes (Aberdeen, 1864), p. 248. and Agnes Beaton, daughter of Cardinal David Beaton, Archbishop of St. Andrews, and Marion Ogilvy. The English ambassador Robert Bowes commented on Elizabeth's Gordon's arrival at court in June 1590. Bowes said she was the heiress of Gight, and her mother, Agnes Beaton, by now Lady Auchindoun, had brought her to court and that George Home was likely to marry her. She became a lady in waiting to Anna of Denmark. James VI and Anna of Denmark bought her an elaborate purple velvet gown with satin sleeves and skirt in November 1590, perhaps for her marriage.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 335, TNA SP52/45/229: National Records of Scotland E35/13.

The Earl of Dunbar died in Whitehall, London, in 1611, without male issue, whereupon the earldom and the barony became dormant. His body was embalmed, but his funeral service did not take place in Westminster until April, after which his body was placed in a lead coffin and sent to Scotland where it was buried under the floor of Dunbar parish church, midway between the font and the pulpit. A magnificent monument, said to be finer than any in Westminster Abbey, was erected in his honour, which is still the distinguishing feature of the interior of this church.

He was the coach of Olympic champions Maarten van der Weijden and Hinkelien Schreuder at the Nationaal Zweminstituut Eindhoven. Swimming career Wouda grew up in Uden, where he joined the 'De Zeester' swimming club at a very young age. His trainers were Martien Swinkels and Rob Kennis, who brought him to the top of Dutch swimming. Wouda made his Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics, where he was the sole male in the Dutch squad of eight females ending 22nd in the 200 m individual medley and 19th in the 400 m individual medley. Afterwards he moved to the United States, where he joined University of Michigan in Ann Arbor under the guidance of trainer-coach Jon Urbanchek, alongside swimmers like Eric Namesnik, Gustavo Borges and Tom Dolan. At the 1993 European Aquatics Championships in Sheffield he won the bronze medal in the 400 m individual medley. Two years after he left Wouda moved back to the Netherlands, where trainer-coach Jacco Verhaeren brought him back to the top. Wouda got his second Olympic selection when he qualified for the 1996 Summer Olympics.

The wing is shoulder mounted and it has a T-tail. It is essentially a developed production version of the Akaflieg Darmstadt D-36.  History  In 1965 Gerhard Waibel left the Technical University of Darmstadt to enter Alexander Schleicher GmbH & Co as a designer. His first project for his new employer was the ASW 12. This sailplane achieved numerous records and victories in national and international competitions. The exploits of Hans-Werner Grosse in an ASW 12 are legendary, e.g. the 1,461 km flight of April 25, 1972 from L√ºbeck to Biarritz which stood for thirty years as the absolute World Free Distance Record. Previously, on July 26, 1970, Ben Greene and Wally Scott co-set a World Free Distance Record by flying separate ASW-12 sailplanes a distance of from Odessa, TX to Columbus, NE. The ASW12 was succeeded by the ASW17.  Construction  The fuselage of the ASW 12 was extremely slender for its time. It had a retractable landing gear and a two- piece canopy, of greater depth than was the case with the D-36. Each individual fuselage was manufactured - as with the D-36 - in two halves laid- up on positive molds. Construction comprised a double sandwich of glass-fibre reinforced composite over balsa wood. The wings are double-tapered with a modified Wortmann FX 62-K-131 profile at the root and Wortmann FX 60-126 at the tip. The wings were of fiberglass/balsa wood sandwich construction and were built in the traditional manner using negative molds. For approach and landing control the ASW 12 possessed a braking parachute rather than traditional spoilers or airbrakes. The system proved unreliable and a number of ASW 12 were retrofitted with a second parachute to reduce the risk of an unsuccessful landing.

At Rainford it connected with the Liverpool and Bury Railway and the St. Helens Railway. It was built by the East Lancashire Railway, which was taken over by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway shortly afterward.Local History Archives The steam railmotor which served the line was sometimes known locally as the \\"Skem Dodger\\" and other times as the \\"Skem Jazzer\\". History Opened on 1 March 1858, passenger services ended 5 November 1956, with goods trains to Rainford ceasing on 16 November 1961 and to Skelmersdale on 4 November 1963. Since then Skelmersdale has had no rail connection but has grown considerably. Re-opening proposals Proposals have been put forward for the reopening of a section of line, reconnecting trains for Skelmersdale into Merseyrail's Northern Line Ormskirk branch.Potential Rail Improvements in North Western England - Evidence presented to the Transport Select Committee, 2002-03 In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies, in its Expanding Access to the Rail Network report, called for funding for the reopening of this station as part of a ¬£500m scheme to open 33 stations on 14 lines closed in the Beeching Axe, including seven new parkway stations. The report proposes extending the line from Ormskirk railway station by laying 3 miles of new single track along the previous route towards Rainford Junction, at a cost estimated to be in the region of ¬£31m. The route is largely intact, however deviation north of Westhead would be required. The proposed Skelmersdale station would be on the north west corner of the town near the Skelmersdale Ring Road, right next to where the old station once was. In February 2017 Lancashire County Council confirmed that the preferred site for Skelmersdale railway station was the former site of Glenburn Sports College/Westbank Campus.Preferred Site Identified for Skelmersdale Railway Station Lancashire County Council County Council Transport portfolio holder John Fillis said that the site \\"is big enough to provide a high quality station with scope to expand to meet future demand.\\".Preferred site identified for Skelmersdale railway station Southport Visiter By September, Merseytravel announced that they would be committing ¬£765,000 to the study into the re-opening, estimating that the station could be open within a decade with a lot of additional funding. Merseytravel's plan would also see a new station built at Headbolt Lane in Kirkby. It has been proposed a new station at Skelmersdale would act as the terminus for Merseyrail's Northern Line, with connections available to Wigan and Manchester. Initial estimates suggest that the scheme could cost around ¬£300 million to develop. On page 36 of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, Long Term Rail Strategy document of October 2017, it states that Merseytravel is currently working with Lancashire County Council and Network Rail to develop a plan to extend the Merseyrail network from Kirkby through to Skelmersdale, with work completed in 2019. They are considering 3rd rail electrification and other alternatives with a new station at Headbolt Lane to serve the Northwood area of Kirkby.

The majority of sketches featured recurring characters and catchphrases, including: * A woman who, when asked by her partner if she wants anything, screams \\"I want a fucking baby!\\", much to the embarrassment of those around her, including her partner * A man who attends social functions and rants at great length about his dislike of such events and the various topics discussed * A man who distrusts his partner due to her previous affair, screaming \\"And try and keep your knickers on this time!\\" whenever they have to spend a moment apart * A man who visits a storage facility in order to get some peace and quiet, making excuses to his partner when they call him * A woman who inadvertently makes embarrassing remarks and double entendres about people she meets concerning any physical defect, such as a hearing aid, a hunch or braces * A man who takes various women on unusual blind dates, such as paintballing or to a cock-fighting match * A man who tries to compliment his partner, who takes offense at a potential hidden meaning and usually calls him an \\"absolute jerk\\" * A prostitute who is visited by awkward or unusual clients * A man who, while trying to assist various women, is indirectly insulted by them as they describe him to friends via telephone * A man who talks to women at social functions until he finds out they have partners, to which he responds \\"Yeah, whatever!\\" and leaves  Production, broadcast and reception  Produced by Zeppotron, Spoons was announced in July 2005 and was filmed in the summer that year, with some scenes shot at the BBC Television Centre. Broadcast between September and November 2005, it received mixed reviews. The New York Times described it as having a \\"tight thematic focus\\" which \\"captured the moments ‚Äì awkward, destructive and banal ‚Äì of young dating and married life\\". However, Sam Leith of The Daily Telegraph was less positive. He compared it to a similar comedy sketch show entitled Swinging, writing of both: \\"They've nothing new to say about the actual experience of serial monogamy and single life, instead peddling - more or less amusingly - the noughties equivalent of mother-in-law jokes. They are, truth be told, about as edgy as Ovaltine.\\" According to BARB, the first two episodes of the series received 1.64 million and 1.86 million viewers respectively, both appearing Channel 4's top 30 programmes of those weeks. However, the final four episodes did not appear in the top 30 programmes. After six episodes were broadcast, the show was not renewed for a second series, reportedly due to \\"low ratings\\". The complete series featuring all six episodes was released on DVD in the UK on 20 August 2007. In Germany, TV network ProSieben adapted a German-language version of Spoons. Filmed in 2006, it broadcast eight episodes beginning in March 2008.

Risk can be defined as the number of incidents occurring for a given amount of cycling. In many countries both the number of incidents and the amount of cycling (expressed in kilometers, hours or trips) are not well known. Non-fatal accidents often go unreported and bicycle use is only occasionally monitored. Some of this subject matter is hotly debated: for example, the discussions as to whether bicycle helmets or cyclepaths really improve safety. The merits of obeying the rules of the road including the use of bicycle lighting at night are less controversial.  Crashes  The overall risk of death from a cycling accident in developed countries has diminished over the last 25 years according to a 2017 analysis of OECD statistics. In the United States, cycling remains a more dangerous mode of transportation when compared to automobiles (not considering total distance traveled).Beck LF, Dellinger AM, O‚ÄôNeil ME. Motor vehicle crash injury rates by mode of travel, United States: using exposure-based methods to quantify differences publisher: American Journal of Epidemiology The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took account of over 32,000 automobile related deaths in 2013 By comparison, WISQUARS the CDC's injury statistics website found just over 1,000 deaths from cycling in 2015. Despite the relative safety compared to automobiles, the number of fatalities and hospitalizations from cycling is significantly greater in the United States compared to other western states such as Germany, Canada, and the Netherlands. In a 2014 analysis, incidence of cycling death took place at a mean rate of 4.7 deaths per 100 million kilometers cycled in the U.S., compared to 1.3 deaths per 100 million kilometers in Germany, 1.0 in the Netherlands, and 1.1 in Denmark.Pucher, John, and Ralph Buehler. ‚ÄúSafer Cycling Through Improved Infrastructure.‚Äù American Journal of Public Health 106.12 (2016): 2089‚Äì2091 The first recorded bicycle crash occurred in 1842, reportedly between Kirkpatrick McMillan, an early rider of the velocipede, and a young girl in Glasgow. The report, however, is vague and the identification disputed. A cyclepath with a protruding wall covering a private street. Climbing plants obstruct the sight of cyclists even more. The same cyclepath seen from the perspective of a resident who leaves the premises by car or bicycle. The climbing plants make it impossible to see approaching cyclists in time, and so requires a very low speed. Causes of crashes vary according to local conditions. Road conditions, weather, speed, brakes, rider visibility, bicycle and automobile traffic, driving under the influence, riding under the influence, and distracted driving are contributing factors to accidents. A study conducted in 2000 by the Institute for Road Safety Research in the Netherlands found that single bicycle crashes accounted for 47% of all bicycle crashes, collisions with obstacles and animals accounted for 12%, and collisions with other road users accounted for 40%, with the remaining 1% having unknown or unclassified cause. Many bicycle crashes are unreported and therefore not included in official statistics. Prospective studies estimate that less than 10% of bicycle crashes are officially reported.Bas de Geus, Gr√©gory Vandenbulcke, Luc Int Panis, Isabelle Thomas, Bart Degraeuwe, Elke Cumps, Joris Aertsens, Rudi Torfs, Romain Meeusen, A prospective cohort study on minor accidents involving commuter cyclists in Belgium, Accident Analysis & Prevention, Available online 4 November 2011, ISSN 0001-4575, 10.1016/j.aap.2011.09.045. In the United Kingdom, cyclists have half of the rate (killed and serious injury per km) of motorcyclists but eight times the rate for motorists.\\"Motorcyclists have an especially poor safety record when compared to other road user groups.

Accident Analysis & Prevention, Volume 42, Issue 6, November 2010, Pages 2149-2157. A cyclist who is hit by a car is more likely to be killed than one who just falls off.Davis R \\"Death on the Streets:Cars and the Mythology of Road Safety.\\" Leading Edge 1993 Hazards Cyclist in Amsterdam looking at phone Hazards particular to bicycles include: * Failure of drivers to see or anticipate bicycles. This happens especially at cross sections where cyclists are often forced to ride on bike infrastructure to the right (in right-hand drive jurisdictions) of traffic. Especially when large trucks are involved, the cyclist can fall under the wheels of the motor vehicle. (Some trucks are equipped with metal side guards to prevent this.) * Dooring - When a car driver opens the car door without checking for passing cyclists beforehand, the cyclist collides with the car door. This is associated with the commonplace layout of streets with cars parallel parked near the curb, and cyclists riding between parked cars and moving cars. * Getting a wheel stuck in a road irregularity, such as a large pothole, railroad track, storm drain, expansion joint, or edge of a driveway. This can cause the bicycle to stop while the rider goes over the handlebars, or it can cause the wheel to travel in a direction different than the rest of the bicycle, which can lead to falling sideways. * Proceeding at speed past stopped traffic can result in collisions when automobiles suddenly turn, either leaving the stopped lane or turning across the road in front of stopped traffic (where oncoming bicycles would not be visible due to the stopped automobiles). Lane splitting is specifically illegal in some jurisdictions. * Bicycling in rain or snow can significantly decrease visibility if wearing glasses, goggles, or helmet with wind screen, due to lack of windshield wipers. * Falling sideways if going too slowly or carrying a heavy, unbalanced load. * Falling due to lack of traction on slippery surfaces, such as ice, mud, or railroad track. * Road rage: Some car drivers actively try to punish cyclists for supposedly wrong behaviour by passing too close on purpose, cutting into their way or by honking loudly. Bicyclists are also subject to all the same types of collisions as automobiles, without the protection of a metal shell but generally traveling at lower speeds. These risks can be increased when traffic participants violate the rules of the road, such as going the wrong way down a one-way street, failing to stop at a red light, or traveling at night without lights.  Traffic engineering  = History = United Kingdom During the mid-20th century, the traffic engineering solutions were sought which eased the passage of traffic through the streets and also protected vulnerable road users. In the 1940s, an influential proponent of this ideology was Herbert Alker Tripp, an assistant commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police. Tripp argued in his book Town Planning and Road Traffic that: \\"If we could segregate pedestrians completely from the wheeled traffic, we could of course abolish pedestrian casualties\\". This philosophy was also pursued by Colin Buchanan; his 1963 report for the UK Government Traffic in Towns, defined future government policy until the end of the century. Buchanan knew that segregation had not been proven to work for cyclists: his 1958 book Mixed Blessing said: \\"The meagre efforts made to separate cyclists from motor traffic have failed, tracks are inadequate, the problem of treating them at junctions and intersections is completely unsolved, and the attitude of the cyclists themselves to these admittedly unsatisfactory tracks has not been as helpful as it might have been\\". Appropriately designed segregated space for cyclists on arterial or interurban routes appears to reduce overall risk. In Ireland, the provision of hard shoulders on interurban routes in the 1970s reportedly resulted in a 50% decrease in accidents.The bicycle, a study of efficiency usage and safety., D.F. Moore, An Foras Forbatha, Dublin 1975 It is reported that the Danes have also found that separate cycle tracks lead to a reduction in rural collisions.Pedestrian Safety, Danish Roads Directorate, Copenhagen, 1998 The Netherlands The trend away from the bicycle and towards motorised transport only began to decrease in the 1970s when Dutch people took to the streets to protest against the high number of child deaths on the roads: in some cases over 500 children were killed in car accidents in the Netherlands in a single year. This protest movement was known as the Stop de Kindermoord (literally \\"Stop the Child Murder\\" in Dutch). The success of this movement ‚Äî along with other factors, such as the oil shortages of 1973‚Äì74 ‚Äî turned Dutch government policy around and the country began to restrict motor vehicles in its towns and cities and direct its focus on growth towards other forms of transport, with the bicycle perceived as critical in making Dutch streets safer and towns and cities more people-friendly and livable. Segregated cycling along a Fietspad in Amsterdam, safe by avoiding conflict with traffic. Cycling is a common mode of transport in the Netherlands, with 36% of the people listing the bicycle as their most frequent mode of transport on a typical day as opposed to the car by 45% and public transport by 11%. Cycling has a modal share of 27% of all trips (urban and rural) nationwide. This high modal share for bicycle travel is enabled by unusually flat topography, excellent cycling infrastructure such as cycle paths, cycle tracks, protected intersections, ample bicycle parking and by making cycling routes shorter, quicker and more direct than car routes. = Road design = United States Concern over national public health and active transportation have inspired states and municipalities to rethink present traffic engineering.http://www.saferoutespartnership.org/sites/default/files/pdf/The_Final_Active_Primer.pdf Following the viral popularity of a video created by video game developer Nick Falbo in February 2014, Dutch-style protected intersections began to gain interest with metropolitan planning organizations. By 2015, Davis, California, Salt Lake City, Utah, and Austin, Texas became the first three U.S. cities to feature protected intersections. Understanding how to effectively reduce cycling accidents and injuries is in part limited by the lack of comprehensive studies regarding municipal infrastructures and the challenge of controlling for the wide range of risks involved with travel by cycle. Despite these statistical limitations, the risk of cycling accidents has been found to be lowest on segregated on-road bike lanes and routes. Higher risk was associated with cycling on multi-use non-segregated facilities with a lack of any designated cycling infrastructure (i.e. sidewalks, unmarked roads). Major arterial thoroughfares have also been shown to be more dangerous for cyclists than minor roads. = Signage = Signs and signals for both bicycles and drivers at an intersection in New York City. United Kingdom Following increased pressure from The Times \\"Cities Fit For Cycling\\" campaign and from other media in Spring 2012, warning signs are now displayed on the backs of many HGVs. These signs are directed against a common type of accident which occurs when the large vehicle turns left at a junction: a cyclist trying to pass on the nearside can be crushed against the HGV's wheels, especially if the driver cannot see the cyclist. The signs, such as the winning design of the InTANDEM road safety competition launched in March 2012, advocate extra care when passing a large vehicle on the nearside. United States The Federal Highway Administration has developed various bicycle signage for motorists, which have evolved over recent years. Signs and signals designed exclusively for bicycles are occasionally used to denote multiple use paths and bicycle facilities. Safety equipment and strategies = Helmets = Helmet use varies from almost none in some regions to being mandatory for children to being mandatory for all cyclists. Helmets are required in most races. Helmets may help prevent head injuries, but laws that enforce helmet use have also been shown to discourage cycling. Using retroreflector and Cat- Eye on a bicycle, showing day and night difference = Lights = Headlights and taillights may be mounted on the bicycle or worn by the cyclist. Bicycle lights can be powered by replaceable batteries, by internal rechargeable batteries, or powered by a hub, bottle or roller dynamo that produces electrical energy when driven by the rotation of the wheels. Cycling lights are typically of lower power than those on motor vehicles, but well-designed lights are perfectly adequate for the lower speed of bicycles. The best bicycle headlights have beams shaped to efficiently light the road. These are also suitably conspicuous to other road users. In order to be effective, it is best for lights to be securely attached to the bicycle and properly aimed, not mounted on soft bags or loose clothing. In the US, state and local ordinances usually require this. = Audible signaling = Bells or other audible signalling devices are required equipment in many jurisdictions. Safety education thumb =Development= United Kingdom Primary safety education has advanced significantly through programmes such as Effective Cycling and the development of Britain's new National Standards for cycle training. In addition to technical improvements in brakes, tyres and bicycle construction generally (for example, it is now rare for a chain to snap and throw the rider when accelerating away from a stop) there are well-understood behavioural models which actively manage the risk posed by other road users. Cycling experts such as the UK's John Franklin emphasise the importance of assertive cycling and good road positioning. Franklin advocates the use of road positions that will give cyclists a good view of the road, will make cyclists visible to other road-users, and will discourage risky behaviour by other road users; he often advocates the use of a centre-of-lane 'primary riding position' when negotiating hazards.Franklin, J. (2007). Cyclecraft, 4th ed. Norwich: TSO =Motorist and cyclist education= Dutch Reach Various jurisdictions include recommending the Dutch Reach (so named because the practice started in the Netherlands) in driver education materials, to prevent hitting a cyclist with an opening door. For drivers and passengers exiting the left side of the vehicle, this involves opening the left-hand door with the right hand, forcing the person to both open the door more slowly and to turn so that bicycles approaching from behind the car are visible. Florida The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), known for its \\"Arrive Alive\\" campaign for motorists in the 1970s, has since expanded into active transportation programs such as their recent \\"Alert Today, Alive Tomorrow\\" and \\"Put it Down\\" campaigns for pedestrians and cyclists. Additionally, FDOT also supports statewide educational programs offering educational materials and bicycle rodeos, such as the Florida PedBike Resource Center, and the University of Miami BikeSafe Program. Idaho In April 2016, Idaho became the first U.S. state to add questions about bicycle and pedestrian safety to the state driver's license exam and educational materials. The revised exam includes a bank of 11 unique questions, of which a minimum of two are automatically generated within every 40-question DMV test.http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/community/boise/article71105862.html  Rural safety  Direct rear impacts with cyclists are a more prominent collision type in arterial/rural road type situations. When they occur in such circumstances they are also associated with significantly increased risk of fatality. Data collated by the OECD indicates that rural locations account for 35% or more of cycling fatalities in Denmark, Finland, France, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, and Spain.Figure IV.7 Pedestrian and cyclist accidents by road type.

Figes wrote novels, literary criticism, studies of feminism, and vivid memoirs relating to her Berlin childhood and later experiences as a Jewish refugee from Hitler's Germany. Early life and education Born Eva Unger in Berlin in 1932 to an affluent, secular Jewish family, she arrived in Britain as a refugee in 1939 with her mother Irma Unger, and her younger brother, Ernst. During Kristallnacht in November 1938, her father Emil was arrested and sent to Dachau concentration camp. He was later released after his wife offered the Nazis a large bribe and managed to escape to England to join his family in London. All of Figes's grandparents on both sides of the family died in concentration camps. Towards the end of the World War II, Figes recalled in The Observer in 1979, \\"my mother gave me nine pence and sent me off to the local cinema ... I sat alone in the dark and watched the newsreel of Belsen\\". It gave her nightmares for many years. She graduated with a B.A. with honours from Queen Mary College in London in 1953. Career She married John George Figes on 10 July 1954. The couple had two children: the writer Kate Figes (1957‚Äì2019), and the historian Orlando Figes. The marriage was dissolved by divorce in 1962. She met the German author G√ºnter Grass in London and the two had a short romantic affair that turned into a lifelong friendship. In the 1960s, she was associated with an informal group of experimental British writers influenced by Rayner Heppenstall that included Stefan Themerson, Ann Quin, Alan Burns, and its informal leader, B. S. Johnson. Unger worked in publishing until 1967, when she became a full-time writer. Figes's best known work is Patriarchal Attitudes, a feminist polemic written in 1970, published one month before Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch. The book argued that nurture rather than nature has shaped all secondary sex characteristics and considered why prominent female figures of the nineteenth century were ambivalent or hostile towards the feminist movement. Figes' novel, Light (1983), is an impressionistic portrait of a single day in the life of Claude Monet from sunrise to sunset. In 2006, it was revealed that Grass had been a member of the Waffen-SS during the Nazi regime.  Awards  Figes won the Guardian Fiction Prize for Winter Journey in 1967.

The book was published as a way to help Gerber raise funds for a lawsuit he was embroiled in at the time,\\"Steve Gerber and Jack Kirby Collaborate on the 'Manslaying Mallard of Vengeance'\\" Comics Feature #12/13 (September/October 1981) p. 14 in which he was battling industry giant Marvel Comics over the ownership of the character Howard the Duck,\\"Gerber Sues Marvel over Rights to Duck,\\" The Comics Journal #62 (March 1981), pp. 11-13. which Gerber created for the company in 1973. Overview The main story of the comic told of Louis \\"Duke\\" Duck, a resident of a typical anthropomorphic comic-book world, who had witnessed his best friend, identified only as ‚ÄúThe Little Guy‚Äù or ‚ÄúTLG,‚Äù vanish into thin air before his eyes. Some years later, TLG reappeared only to die at Duke's feet‚Äîbut not before telling the tale of how he was exploited and destroyed by a thoughtless conglomeration, ‚ÄúGodcorp.‚Äù Swearing revenge, Duke vowed to take down Godcorp no matter what the cost. Subsequent Destroyer Duck tales would reveal that the Little Guy who died at Duke's feet was in fact a clone, and the original was still held captive by Godcorp; eventually, Gerber (by that point on better terms with Marvel, the lawsuit having long since been settled) revealed that The Little Guy's real name was actually ‚ÄúLeonard‚Äù‚Äîa new duck character that, for all intents and purposes, was identical in every way (except in name and character ownership) to Howard. The stories introduced sentient scented dolls and Wobblina Strangelegs, who nearly got her own one-shot. After five issues, Gerber gave up writing the title, but remained its editor. Buzz Dixon wrote the last two issues, about a STD-infected parody of Gilligan‚Äôs Island. Frank Miller drew the cover of the final issue. The seven issues of the comic were published very sporadically. Issue #1 of the original Destroyer Duck series, labeled the \\"Special Lawsuit Benefit Edition\\", is notable for containing the first appearance of Sergio Aragon√©s‚Äôs Groo the Wanderer and also featuring additional stories by Mark Evanier, Dan Spiegle, Shary Flenniken, Martin Pasko, and Joe Staton. The rest of the series contained the back-up feature The Starling, written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel, with art by Val Mayerik. In 1994, while Gerber was working at Image for Top Cow Studio on Codename: Strykeforce, Gerber planned for issue #14 to include Destroyer Duck. At the last minute, Marc Silvestri declined, forcing Gerber and his editor, David Wohl, to revise the story. Destroyer Duck does not appear as such in the story, but Gerber introduces Specimen Q, a mysterious character imprisoned in his armor who is Destroyer Duck, as readers will learn in the Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck one-shot in 1996.

Early life William was born 16 March 1851, Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland to Paul and Mary Anne Levis Vickery. Paul Vickery died young and Mary Anne supported the family by successfully running the family store in Skibbereen. Paul and Mary Anne had ten children: * Samuel emigrated to Australia * Minnie (Waters) stayed in County Cork * Sarah Ellen (Burrowes) also emigrated to Australia, married Robert Burrowes,M.L.A. Bendigo * Elizabeth (Hadden) moved to Piedmont, California next door to the William Vickerys * Frances (Keppel) emigrated to New York with her husband Fred Keppel * Avesia died at 17 * Georgiana (Atkins) married Henry Atkins. Their son, also named Henry Atkins, became a partner in Vickery, Atkins & Torrey. Henry Atkins (the son) eventually moved to Piedmont just down the street from William and Elizabeth * George stayed in Southern Ireland * John moved to London (his son Philip was knighted) * William moved to California, ending up in Piedmont, on Kingston Avenue. William went to school in Skibbereen and subsequently to the Blue Coat School (known more formally as The King's Hospital) in Dublin. When he finished school he went to work for a Dublin bank. The bank sent him to the West Indies to check on various accounts. While there, he made a trip to northern South America. He went by dugout canoe up the Essequibo River. Later, a San Francisco newspaper referred to him as \\"the adventuresome Mr. Vickery\\". When he came down with tuberculosis, the family sent him to California to get well (or die). He travelled by way of New York where his brother-in-law Fred Keppel had a well- known art store. Fred Keppel dealt primarily in etchings as he was color blind. He gave William a consignment of etchings to sell, if he could, in San Francisco. William did not take the recently completed transcontinental railroad, but went by ship to Nicaragua, portaged across to the Pacific, and continued by ship to San Francisco. In 1880, he was living in San Rafael, Marin County,1880 United States Census for San Rafael, Marin, California, p. 110A, where he was able to follow doctor's orders to lead an outdoor life of activities such as horseback riding. It worked. He got well. Family After establishing himself in California and regaining his health, William wrote to his sweetheart, Sarah Keppel (1852‚Äì1917),Madronia Cemetery, Saratoga, Santa Clara, California in Ireland, \\"come marry me\\". She did. They had 3 children: * Frederick Paul Vickery (1879‚Äì1965) Professor of Geology at U.C.L.A. and Sacramento State and later Director of the Crocker Art Gallery, Sacramento, and the San Francisco Art Center at Montalvo, Saratoga. * Ruth Vickery Moser (1884‚Äì1936) housewife active in civic affairs in Cupertino California. * Robert Kingston Vickery (1890‚Äì1971) entomologist and builder in Berkeley. He married Ruth Bacon (1893‚Äì1983), a niece of Lucy Bacon, an early California impressionist painter who had studied under Pizarro in France. Vickery, Atkins & Torrey Christmas Card ‚Äì one of the first sold in San Francisco William began his art business by opening a little kiosk against the wall of the Palace Hotel on Market Street in San Francisco. As the business became established and grew, his nephew Henry Atkins joined in 1888 and Frederic Cheever Torrey (1864‚Äì1935) in 1891 or so.Thompson, Daniella \\"Berkeleyan Torrey Owned Duchamp's Most Famous Painting\\" Berkeley Daily Planet, 2 February 2009, In 1900 the company became Vickery, Atkins & Torrey. In March 1891, and again in 1893 and 1895, William Vickery supervised a series of loan exhibitions that introduced Impressionism to California. These exhibitions included paintings by Monet, Eugene Boudin, Camille Pissarro, Pierre Renoir, and Edgar Degas.Gerdts, William H \\"The Land of Sunshine\\" 2002 Vickery, Atkins & Torrey survived both the Panic of 1893 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, due in part to the resourcefulness of William Vickery. In the Panic of 1893, people were just not buying fine art for Christmas presents. Vickery suggested to his customers, \\"why not remember them with a lovely Christmas card?\\" He got his Haddan nieces (who lived next door) to mount up as Christmas cards a large collection of post cards from the Museo San Marco of Florence, Italy. The cards were of Fra Angelico angels in gorgeous color. These were the first Christmas cards in San Francisco. When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire hit, the store was at 236 Post Street. His youngest son, Robert, recounted rushing (by ferry boat) with his father to San Francisco and the store. Had a pair of very valuable Chinese porcelain jars on the mantel survived? Yes, they had fallen off the mantel and rolled under a couch unharmed. General Funston of the Presidio sent a wagon to help save the store's treasures. While the store survived the earthquake, it was dynamited to help stop the great fire. The store relocated temporarily to 1744 California Street. The new store was at 550 Sutter Street. It had a charming courtyard, fountain, and wrought iron gate. It still stands. William Vickery retired from the business in 1912. Retirement After retiring from the business in 1912, William and Sarah moved from their home on Kingston Avenue in Piedmont, California to Saratoga, California. They had bought 10 acres in the foothills of the Santa Clara Valley from an Edinburgh, Scotland land company that had purchased the area from the original Mexican land grantees. They lived in a comfortable house with a sweeping view of the valley built for them by their son Robert. William died in Saratoga on 25 March 1925.

It was completed in 1638 as the fourth of the Lascaris towers. An artillery battery was built around the tower in 1715. Today, the tower and battery are a restaurant. History Qawra Tower was built in 1638 near the tip of Qawra Point, commanding the entrance to St. Paul's Bay to the west and Salina Bay to the east. It was built on or near the site of a medieval watch post. Since 1659, it has Gƒßallis Tower in its line of sight. This linked Qawra Tower with the De Redin towers that allowed communication from Gozo to Valletta. The tower's design is similar to the other Lascaris towers, with two floors each having a single room. Access to the upper floor was originally by a wooden ladder or scala di corda. In 1715, a semi-circular gun battery was built around the seaward side of the tower. The battery had a low parapet, with guns being mounted en barbette. There were two blockhouses, which were linked by a V-shaped redan containing the main gate. Both the blockhouses and the redan were pierced with musketry loopholes. An entrenchment wall was built close to the tower and battery in the 1760s, and parts of it can still be seen. The tower was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. Before World War II, the battery was fitted with two concrete gun emplacements. A pillbox was also built nearby. Present day One of the blockhouses and the redan, which now serve as the entrance to the restaurant Today, the tower is a restaurant, while the heavily altered battery serves as a swimming pool. The tower is slightly dilapidated, having been plastered with cement at some time, which is now flaking away, and has had water tanks and rough additional brickwork added to its roof.

From 1929 to 1931 it was taken over by the Borgward group. Hansa was based in the Bremen suburb of Hastedt. History =Founding= 1914 Hansa-Lloyd type L 6/20 PS doppelphaeton The first cars were licence-built Kri√©ger electric vehicles, beginning in 1905. Petrol- engined models followed in 1908 with 3685 cc engines, but few were made. Belgian electrical engineer, Paul Mossay, was employed for four years as chief engineer, designing both engines and electric vehicles. In 1914 the company merged with Lloyd to become Hansa-Lloyd Werke AG. The company continued to change names and badging on a number of occasions and were never on a sound financial footing. =Interwar years= Most of the Hansa/Lloyd cars made during this period were sold as Hansa with the Hansa-Lloyd name mainly attached to commercial vehicles, with the exception of the Treff-A√ü and the Trumpf-A√ü. In 1929 the company was integrated in the Borgward group after the purchase of Hansa by Carl F. W. Borgward, and car production ceased. 1935 Hansa-Lloyd DL 5 electric truck Hansa-Automobilwerke founder remained at the head of the company through the 1920s, as well as being the founder of the \\"Gemeinschaft der Deutschen Automobilfabriken\\" (Association of German Carmakers, GDA). GDA incorporated truck manufacturers N.A.G., Hansa-Lloyd, and lower-cost automobile manufacturer Brennabor (and later also and railroad car manufacturers Hawa) but were never able to successfully merge or streamline the operations of the various companies. When automobile production resumed after World War I, Hansa-Lloyd's sole model was the Treff-A√ü (Ace of Clubs), a robust if somewhat outdated car based on pre-war designs.von Fersen, p. 62 Its engine was a 4-litre four-cylinder producing . Allmers, however, was determined to manufacture a modern high-end automobile and in 1922 he ordered Hansa-Lloyd's engineers to develop an eight-cylinder car incorporating all of the latest technical developments. At the German Automobile Show in Berlin in the fall of 1923, the all new 16/80 with a 4.2-litre inline-eight was presented. For unknown reasons - although a series of strikes in 1924 may have had an impact - the car never entered series production, with the company enjoying steady sales of the sturdy old 18/60 and focusing on the development of an all-new light truck instead. Hansa-Lloyd 20/100 Trumpf-A√ü at the 1928 Berlin Motor Show Allmers' dream of a luxury car had not abated, however, and in 1924 he hired an Italian engineer named Pellegretti away from Isotta- Fraschini. Pellegretti developed a new, more powerful and somewhat larger car which bowed at the Berlin Show in 1925. The new 8-cylinder 4.6-litre Hansa- Lloyd 18/100 Trumpf-A√ü (Ace of Trumps) produced and sat on a wheelbase.von Fersen, p. 64 The imposing new car was as good as anything else built in Germany at the time, but the development cost and minuscule production numbers helped lead to Allmers being gradually pushed out of the running of the company by the late 1920s. In spite of small sales, the Ace of Trumps saw continuous development during its production run: in 1927 or 1928 the engine was enlarged from , the name accordingly changing to 20/100, while the wheelbase increased to in 1928 and to in 1929.von Fersen, p. 66 After Borgward's takeover, eight-cylinder production ended in 1930 as the world entered the Great Depression. The Borgward group also included the Varel- produced Hansa A8 17/95PS eight-cylinder car, powered by an American-made Continental engine.von Fersen, p. 67 The last 20/100 cars continued to be sold into 1931 as the \\"Hansa Imperator;\\" these were equipped with a bored out 5.8-litre engine. Hansa 1700 Sport The Hansa-Lloyd factory was located opposite of Borgward's own Goliath factory on F√∂hrenstrasse in Bremen-Hastedt; the Hansa-Lloyd truck range complemented the Goliath range while the purchase also allowed Carl Borgward to fulfill his dream to produce his own cars. Carl Borgward stopped Hansa-Lloyd's production of luxury cars, but from 1933 onwards the brand name Hansa became the name of several Borgward passenger car models. The Hansa Konsul and Hansa Matador were introduced and shortly thereafter the small rear-engined Goliath Pionier-derived Hansa 400 and 500. 1937 Hansa 1100 In April 1933 the tax rules which had been favoring small cars such as the Hansa 400 were abolished; the slow selling smaller Hansas were discontinued soon thereafter. Borgward decided to instead produce the new Hansa 1100 four-cylinder two-door and four door all-steel Sedan, and then the six-cylinder 1700 and 2000. From 1939, the 2000 carried the Borgward brand. The name Hansa started to be phased out, becoming Hansa Borgward, then Borgward Hansa and finally Borgward. Until 1937, the Hansa-Lloyd brand was used on a number of commercial vehicles (trucks and buses), from the one-ton \\"Express\\" to the five-ton \\"Merkur\\". These models were largely replaced by Borgward-branded vehicles, with a few models sold with just \\"Hansa\\" badging in 1938. In the Second World War, the Bremen factory was completely destroyed. =Post war= Hansa 1100 Coupe The Borgward Hansa 1500, sold from 1949 onwards, was the first new car construction in Germany, followed by the Borgward Hansa 2400 large fastback sedan in 1952. From 1958, during the last three years of production, the former Goliath 1100 automobile were sold under the Hansa 1100 brand name until the Borgward group collapsed in 1961.

Located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, USA, the complex is named after its owner Tony Stark, who is the alter ego of the superhero Iron Man. The structure is composed of a 93-story Main Tower flanked by a 35-story South Building and 55-story North Building. Located at the top of the Main Tower was the Watchtower of the superhero The Sentry, but it has been replaced by Heimdall's observatory. The Main Tower is informally known as Avengers Tower, as it serves as the headquarters of the superhero team, the Avengers, similar to the Avengers Mansion. Currently, the main Stark Tower is located in Broadway, occupying the space where the Cond√© Nast Building is in the real world. The Stark Tower, eventually changed to Avengers Tower, has been shown in the films starting with The Avengers set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fictional history The Stark Tower Complex was built as a world-class financial and business facility to complement the Midtown Manhattan business district. The building was completed as a gleaming beacon of modern architecture after four years of excavation and construction. It is located in the vicinity of Manhattan's Columbus Circle approximately 10 blocks north of the Baxter Building, headquarters of the superhero team the Fantastic Four. While initially intending to use the top three floors of the Main Tower as his state-of-the- art bachelor pad, Stark gave them over to the Avengers as their base of operations after their former base, Avengers Mansion, was destroyed. Longtime caretaker of the Avengers Mansion Edwin Jarvis was asked to resume his duties in the new location. Later, when the Sentry became a member of the Avengers, his long-hidden Watchtower appeared, integrating itself atop the Main Tower,New Avengers #10 fully integrated into the building's existing architecture. Serving as both Sentry's headquarters and as the private residences of Robert Reynolds and his wife Lindy, the 20-story watchtower is operated and maintained by CLOC (Centrally Located Organic Computer), a near- sentient computer of Sentry's own design. The lower levels of the Main Tower, along with both the South and North Buildings, are largely occupied with Stark's subsidiaries and non-profit organizations. After the passing of the Superhuman Registration Act (SRA), Iron Man was tapped to head the task force charged with enforcing the Act. Subsequently, Stark Tower became the base of operations of the task force. The controversy surrounding the SRA broke the Avengers team apart leaving Tony Stark to form a new team, the Mighty Avengers, who continue to occupy the Main Tower's higher levels. When the Tower became the headquarters of the SRA task force, it was assigned by the government a squad of Cape-Killer guards with the call sign \\"Force Unit 9\\". During the events of World War Hulk, a violent battle between The Hulk and Iron Man nearly caused the collapse of Stark Tower.World War Hulk #1 (Aug. 2007) The tower was rebuilt by Stark under his S.H.I.E.L.D. organization, making it S.H.I.E.L.D. property. Stark Tower becomes the setting for a multi- issue conflict between humans and a murderous Skrull hunting them for sport. During the \\"Secret Invasion\\", many non-powered New York citizens, including Daily Bugle reporter Ben Urich, end up at Stark Tower. Unfortunately, it had become the hunting ground for a Skrull. He is shown killing most of the members of a design firm that had rented space in the building. Ben Urich regains control of the security shutters and the Skrull is tricked into throwing itself out a high window. It dies on impact.Secret Invasion: Front Line 1‚Äì5 When Norman Osborn took over S.H.I.E.L.D., and renamed it H.A.M.M.E.R., he also took ownership of the tower.Dark Avengers #1 After Osborn is removed from power following the Siege of Asgard, the tower is returned to Stark. With the Sentry's death, his watch tower disappeared from the rooftop where it is replaced by Heimdall's observatory as sign of solidarity between Earth and Asgard.Siege #4 (2010) During the events of the Fear Itself storyline, Thing acquired a hammer. This transformed him into a being with Asgardian-like power called Angir: Breaker of Souls. Red Hulk started to fight him to protect the innocents, but got batted away by Thing. Red Hulk survived though and to try and remedy it, Thing tossed his hammer through Avengers Tower, bringing it down onto Red Hulk.Avengers #14 A new Stark Tower was later built on the site of the original.

The tower's unique power sustainability inspires Loki to select the tower as the prime location to harness the Tesseract and open a wormhole to draw his army to Earth. After the battle between Loki's forces and the Avengers, the upper levels of the tower are destroyed, along with the majority of the \\"STARK\\" insignia that adorned one side of the tower (the only remaining letter is an \\"A\\", as a nod to the Avengers). Tony and Pepper Potts are later seen with plans for revisions to Stark Tower, showing sleeping quarters will be available for each Avenger-as signified by each hero's symbol shown on different floors (\\"Sleeping Quarters 6\\", with a symbol of Captain America's shield, is the clearest one on screen) and an airpad.

In the scene, Spider-Man glides through the gap. =Video games= * Stark Tower is a base and level in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance video game. After the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier UNN Alpha is damaged by the attack of Dr. Doom's Masters of Evil, Tony Stark offers his property as a provisional base of operations. The heroes are based there up until the mission in the Valley of Spirits, after which they relocate to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum to cope with the Masters of Evil's access to the magical knowledge of Baron Mordo and Loki. Later, towards the end of the game, the heroes return to a Doom- warped version of Stark Tower (dubbed \\"Doomstark\\" in the game), where the player must assist Nick Fury on fighting hordes of Iron Man-like drones sent by Doom, and prepare for the upcoming battle in Doom's Castle in Latveria. In a cutscene, Stark states that there are 40 stories in this version of the tower. Also, his lab complex becomes available for navigation after beating the Omega Base mission. * Stark Tower is a full level in The Punisher. Frank Castle infiltrates it after learning that the Eternal Sun gang wants to steal some high technology from the tower. Iron Man appears after Punisher's departure, watching the huge mess the mafia and the vigilante caused. * Stark Tower is also a landmark in The Incredible Hulk and can be destroyed. Within the game it is stated to be the second-tallest building on Manhattan, between Empire State Building and Chrysler Building. * Stark Tower is featured in Spider-Man: Web of Shadows. It is minor at first in that the player can casually visit the spot. Later on, it is one of the most important areas in which the building is the safest possible area (besides Wilson Fisk Industries which is later on another safe zone) due to the symbiote invasion. During that time, Stark Tower serves as a rescue shelter and a temporary hospital. Black Widow and S.H.I.E.L.D. use Stark Tower as the safe zone of civilians and boot camp of S.H.I.E.L.D. Spider-Man could rescue civilians and place the civilians at the safe zone besides Security Domes. All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, caravans, airships and un-infected civilians are located there. To ensure its safety, electric fences are barricaded there which could un-infect a symbiote creature. Black Widow tells about their safe zone and plan to Spider-Man and a released Tinkerer. At one part of the story, it is under attack by Zombie Symbiote and Slasher Symbiotes who try to open the barriers. Spider-Man helps defeat the Zombie Symbiotes while S.H.I.E.L.D. loads all the civilians into an aircraft. One barrier opens, so Berserker Symbiotes attack and try to get into Stark Tower. Spider-Man calls in an air strike. The air strike eliminates the symbiotes and Stark Tower is safe once again. As in the main comics, the Sentry's Watchtower is on top of the tower. * Stark Tower appears in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 as the main hub during Act 1, and as the hub for Iron Man's Pro-Registration side during Act 2. Its layout is identical to how it appeared in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, but does not allow entry into Iron Man's lab complex.

His execution for involvement in a bank robbery and shooting death of a police officer became a cause c√©l√®bre in Francoist Spain for Catalan autonomists, pro-independence supporters, and anarchists. After fighting the Spanish state with the terrorist group Iberian Liberation Movement in the early 1970s, he was convicted and executed by garrote vil for the death of a policeman during a shoot out. Catalonians viewed Puig Antich's judicial death as symbolic retribution for the region's fight for self-government, and his name became commonplace in Barcelona. The incident inspired works by Catalan artists Joan Mir√≥ and Antoni T√†pies, and a satirical play by the Catalan theater group Els Joglars. The 2006 film Salvador depicts Puig Antich's time on death row. After the Spanish Supreme Court declined an effort to review the execution, an Argentine court adopted the case under universal jurisdiction in 2013.  Iberian Liberation Movement  Salvador Puig Antich was born May 30, 1948, in Barcelona, Spain. He was a member of the Workers' Commissions before he joined the Iberian Liberation Movement (Movimiento Ib√©rico de Liberaci√≥n, or MIL). The group organized armed robberies against banks, which they called \\"expropriations\\", allegedly to fund their actions against Francoist Spain in 1972 and 1973. After a series of these robberies, he was arrested for the death of a policeman during a shootout. A military court sentenced him to death by garrote vil in the Model prison. His execution proceeded despite international outcry, as Spain's second state execution in eight years. University students in Barcelona and Madrid went on strike in protest of the execution, whereupon they fought with police.  Legacy  Catalonians interpreted Puig Antich's execution as symbolic retaliation for the region's fight for autonomy, which led to public demonstrations. As one of the last convicted criminals executed by Franco, Puig Antich became a household name in Barcelona. The Groupes d'action r√©volutionnaire internationalistes (GARI) formed to avenge his death. Several years after his 1974 execution, the Catalan performance group Els Joglars performed La torna, a 1977 satire against torture based on Puig Antich's execution. Even though Francoist Spain had ended, along with its censorship laws, members of Els Joglars were jailed or forced into exile. Spanish theater groups protested across Spain. Catalan painters Joan Mir√≥ and Antoni T√†pies both alluded to Puig Antich's execution in their mid-1970s work. Mir√≥'s The Hope of a Condemned Man triptych features a line that \\"sighs and falls with faltering resignation\\" and flicked paint. T√†pies's Assassins lithograph series, presented at the Parisian Galerie Maeght, too was inspired by Puig Antich's execution and Spanish politics. The 2006 film Salvador depicts Puig Antich's time spent on death row. An effort by family members and outside groups to review Puig Antich's case was rejected by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2007, but an Argentine judge adopted the case along with several others under universal jurisdiction in 2013. Puig Antich is interred in the Montju√Øc Cemetery in Barcelona.

Together with the district of Ermita, it serves as Manila's center for commerce and tourism. Etymology The name Malate is believed to be derived from a corruption of the Tagalog word maalat (\\"salty\\"). Legends known that when a Spanish man asked a woman about the name of the place, the lady's little brother, tasted salt, shouted \\"Maalat, Ate!\\" (\\"Sister, it is salty!\\"). The Spanish man misheard it, and used the words as the place's name. However this a common modern Filipino 'folk etymology' mechanism (and commonly employed into many Philippine place name etymologies today) and has no historical basis (eg. the term \\"ate\\" was not adopted into Tagalog vernacular from Minnan \\"achi\\" until much later into the 19th c). The actual origin of Malate indeed came from \\"maalat\\" but for geographical reasons. Antonio Morga writing in 1609: \\"Manila has two drives for recreation. One is by land, along the point called Nuestra Se√±ora de Guia. It extends for about a legua along the shore, and is very clean and level. Thence it passes through a native street and settlement, called Bagunbayan, to a chapel, much frequented by the devout, called Nuestra Se√±ora de Guia, and continues for a goodly distance further to a monastery and mission-house of the Augustinians, called Mahalat.\\" Rizal who republished Morga's account, later annotated: \\"Better, Maalat. The Spaniards pronounced this later Malate. There lived the chief Tag√°ls after they were deprived of their houses in Manila, among whom were the families of Raja Matanda and Raja Soliman. San August√≠n says that even in his day many of the ancient nobility dwelt there, and that they were very urbane and cultured. \\"The Men hold various positions in Manila, and certain occupations in some of the local public functions. The women make excellent lace, in which they are so skilfull that the Dutch women cannot surpass them.\\" This is still true of the women.\\" Maalat most likely was referring to the brackish waters, where the river estuary (ie today's Malate Estero) meets the bay; named most likely used way before arrival of the Spanish. History View of Malate Church in 1831 Malate was thought of as the place where the kings/high chiefs of Manila settled after losing their fort \\"Maynila\\" (now Intramuros) to the Spanish in 1571. During most of the Spanish colonial period, Malate was an open space with a small fishing village. During the Spanish period, the center of activity was the Malate Church, dedicated to Our Lady of Remedies. After the United States of America annexed the islands in 1898 as a consequence of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, American urban planners envisioned the development of Malate as the newest and trendiest exclusive residential area for American families. American expatriates and some of the old Spanish mestizo families populated the district in modern high rise apartments and bungalows. Despite extensive damage after the Second World War, many homes and buildings were still standing. The displaced wealthy families who evacuated their homes during the war returned and re-built their private villas and kept the whole district exclusively residential until the 1970s. The once exclusive residential areas in western Malate began to transform into a commercial area with some large homes and residential apartments being converted into small hotels, specialty restaurants and cafes. During the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, visual and performing artists found a haven in Malate and it became a bohemian enclave.. Accessibility The district can be directly accessed by the main roads like the Roxas Boulevard, Quirino Avenue and Taft Avenue. The Light Rail Transit (LRT-1) follows Taft Avenue and stops at two stations located in Malate, Vito Cruz Station and Quirino Station. Economy View of the Philippine Navy headquarters and the Manila Yacht Club =Government offices= Agencies like the Department of Finance or DOF (Kagawaran ng Pananalapi), the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas or BSP (Philippines Central Bank) and lending institution LandBank of the Philippines established their headquarters in the district, whilst the National Naval Command Headquarters of the Philippine Navy, is at the boundary limits of Manila and the city of Pasay along Roxas Boulevard. The Bureau of Plant Industry is also headquartered in the area. The Apostolic Nunciature to the Philippines is located in the district along Taft Avenue near Quirino Avenue. This serves as the residence of the Pope during visits in the country. Facilities The Rizal Memorial Stadium in Malate In the 1990s, Malate and the nearby district of Ermita had been \\"cleaned-up\\" and big businesses and resort hotels have sprouted in the district. Harrison Plaza, Manila's first enclosed modern mall, is located in the Malate district. There is one hospital, the Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, located at the corner of Roxas Boulevard and Quirino Avenue. =Recreation= The district is also home to the Philippine's first sports stadium, the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex and the country's premiere zoological park, the Manila Zoological and Botanical Garden. Promenades and parks by the Manila Bay have been made more convenient and safe with the opening of the Manila Baywalk area and the renovated Plaza Rajah Sulayman. A portion of the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex also lies within the district. The district contains a red-light district. Education and scholarly activity Saint La Salle Hall and Henry Sy, Sr. Building of the De La Salle University. Education in Malate is mostly provided by private schools.

Early life Mostowfi al-Mamalek came from an important aristocratic and well-known family of high-ranking bureaucrats during the Qajar era, originally from the province of Ashtian. The family are said to have their origins with the Safavids.Ervand Abrahamian, \\"A History of Modern Iran\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2008: , 9780521821391), p. 10. Mostowfi's father was Mirza Yousof Mostowfi al-Mamalek, a bureaucrat of the Qajar court, Nasseraddin Shah's grand vizier and a Prime Minister. His father was also assigned to determine the new reaches of Tehran city when the population reached 150000. His grandfather was Mirza Hasan Mostowfi al-Mamalek I and was given the title of Mostofi al Mamalek under Mohammad Shah Qajar.Mehdi Bamdad, DICTIONARY OF THE NATIONAL BIOGRAPHY OF IRAN TWELFTH, THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES, Vol.1, pp.318-312. Mostowfi was also second cousins with Mohammad Mossadegh.Mohammad Mossadegh, \\"Musaddiq‚Äôs Memoirs\\" (Jebhe, 1988: ) One year before his father's death, Nasereddin Shah granted the title Mostowfi ol-Mamalek (\\"chief financier of the country\\") to the very young, Hasan. ªAbd AllƒÅh Mustawfƒ´, IThe administrative and social history of the Qajar period: the story of my life (Mazda Publishers, 1997: ), p. 124. The Mostowfi ol-Mamalek family passed on the central office at the finance ministry from father to son throughout the 19th century and until the 1920s. When the nobility started to ridicule Hasan for being given such an important job/title at such young age, Nasereddin Shah, convinced of the young boy's talents, added the title \\"Aaqaa\\" (Sir) to Hasan's titles, thereby obliging the nobility to call him \\"Sir\\" every time they addressed him. He was since frequently referred to simply as \\"Aaqaa\\" in political circles. However, there is a source that suggests that it was his generosity that earned him the title \\"Aaqaa\\", rather than it being bestowed upon him. His education began at the age of five under tutelage of Mahmud Khan Malekalshoara. He studied all customary subjects such as Arabic grammar and literature, but he also had a good command of the French language. In 1885, subsequent to his father's death, he undertook all his responsibilities under Mossaddegh's father, Mirza Hedayatollah Vizier daftar's supervision. At the age of 18, he married Nasr- ol-Din Shah's granddaughter, Khanom Esmat el Molouk, and became a member of the royal family. European travel and the creation of the Society for Humanity After a series of disagreements with the newly instated Mozaffar ad-Din Shah, Mostowfi al-Mamalek travelled to Paris from 1900 to 1907.Ervand Abrahamian, \\"A History of Modern Iran\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2008: ), p. 49. During this period he visited many European countries and observed their systems of government. During his trips to Europe, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah gave him multiple invitations to return to Iran, however he declined. In the year 1907, after the Persian Constitutional Revolution and the death of Mozzafar ad-Din Shah, Mostowfi al-Mamalek returned to Iran accompanied by Ali Asghar Khan, who had just been appointed Prime Minister of Iran by Mohammad Ali Shah Soon after his return he set up a humanitarian society called the Society for Humanity, Jameeyate Ensaniat, with Mohammad Mossadegh as his deputy. The society met regularly at Mostowfi's residence and eventually became part of the inter-society confederation, with Mossadegh as their permanent representative.Mohammad Mossadegh, \\"Musaddiq‚Äôs Memoirs\\" (Jebhe, 1988: ), Chapter 7, p.129. Political career During the Persian Constitutional Revolution era, Mostowfi was appointed Minister 15 times, and Prime Minister 6 times. At various points in his career he held the positions of prime minister, minister of war, majlis member and minister without portfolio. This was impart due to the political turmoil in Iran at the time which often saw governments only last several months before being replaced. =Popularity and character= Mostowfi has been considered as one of the most popular Iranian politicians of the 20th century.Cyrus Ghani, Iran and the Rise of the Reza Shah: From Qajar Collapse to Pahlavi Power (I.B.Tauris, 2001: ), p. 17. Like his father, Mostowfi is said to have carried himself as a gentleman and was considered kind, honest, steadfast, humble and generous. During his service to Iran Mostowfi stood up to British and Russian influence in Iran, especially during World War I, giving credence to his reputation as a person of character and integrity. It has been noted that, unlike some of his contemporaries, Mostowfi was patriotic and did not engage with foreign powers in order to preserve or boost his own financial or political standings.Cosroe Chaqu√®ri, Beginning politics : the reproductive cycle of children's tales and games in Iran: a historical inquiry (IMazdazk, 1996), p. 180. =Criticism= Despite his perceived popularity Mostowfi has at times been criticized for being unable to form a strong government with the ability to exercise what it presented to the Majlis. It has also been suggested that on occasion Mostowfi showed a lack of strong leadership. =Imperial allegiances= Sources disagree on his allegiances to foreign powers with some claiming he was a Russophile and others stating he favoured the Germans and Turks. Prime minister =The First Term= Sometime after his return to Iran, Mostowfi became the minister of war until the bombardment of Majlis. Following the conquest of Tehran, first he was appointed the minister of finance in Sepahdar Azam's cabinet and then became the minister of Ahmad Shah‚Äôs court. Following to the resignation of Sepadar‚Äôs first cabinet, he became Ahmad Shah‚Äôs prime minister. Mostowfi‚Äôs first term as Prime Minister of Persia began in July 1910 during the 2nd Majlis. His party, Melliyoun Democrats, were mostly young, well educated and had traveled to Europe. They were in favour of the separation of church and state; taxing the landowners and businesses; adopting compulsory national service and borrowing internally instead of internationally. Mostowfi‚Äôs cabinet, backed by the Democrats, was known as the \\"Young Peoples‚Äô Cabinet\\". During his first term Mostowfi faced the issue of security in Iran. Multiple assassinations of political and religious figures occurred. Mostowfi decided to stop these assassinations and declared that all private citizens turn in their arms.Ervand Abrahamian. Iran between two revolutions, Princeton University Press, 1982, , p. 107 Almost all pro-Democrat forces obliged, however some pro-Moderates forces ignored the order, including Sattar Khan.Ervand Abrahamian. Khomeinism: Essays on the Islamic Republic, I.B. Tauris, 1993, , p. 93 As a result of the pro-Moderates forces actions the government used the newly appointed Tehran police chief, Yeprem KhanErvand Abrahamian. Iran between two revolutions, Princeton University Press, 1982, , p. 99 to exercise the order.Ervand Abrahamian, \\"A History of Modern Iran\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2008: ), p. 58. With this Mostowfi proved he was able to make tough decisions when necessary. During his term in office the government received a letter from the British and Russian Ministers in Tehran complaining about the lack of security on the road between Bushehr- Shiraz- Isfahan. The British stated that the Irainan government had three months to rectify the problem. If they failed they would bring in 1500 Indian soldiers under British command to safeguard the route. Mostowfi's government responded by creating the Swedish Gendarmerie, seeing this as a way to keep Iran independent of British involvement in internal security. With the death of the Regent in September 1910 Parliament was convened to elect the next Regent. The candidates were Mostowfi and Mirza Abolghasem Khan Naser ol Molk. Mostowfi lost the election.Ervand Abrahamian. Iran between two revolutions, Princeton University Press, 1982, , p. 106\\"Record of Current Events\\", The American Monthly Review of Reviews (November 1910), pp544‚Äì547Janet Afary, The Iranian Constitutional Revolution, 1906‚Äì1911: Grassroots Democracy, Social Democracy and the Origins of Feminism (Columbia University Press, 1996) p309 =The Second Term= Mostowfi's second appointment as Prime Minister coincided with the onset of World War I. Iran had declared neutrality in the war and the country further reinforced its neutral stance by appointing Mostowfi, who was known to support neutrality.Joseph J. St. Marie, Shahdad Naghshpour, Iran Revolutionary Iran and the United States: Low-Intensity Conflict in the Persian Gulf (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011: ), p. 59. However, his government leaned towards the German and the Turks. It is important to note that being pro-German in this regard was simply seen as a political move to support a third nation that may aid in curbing the influence of the British and Russians in Iran.Cyrus Ghani, Iran and the Rise of the Reza Shah: From Qajar Collapse to Pahlavi Power (I.B.Tauris, 2001: ), p. 20. Mostowfi approached the Russian authorities and asked that they withdraw their troops from Azerbaijan as their presence gave the Turks a reason to Invade. The Russians responded by asking what guarantees could be given that their withdrawal would not be followed by the insertion of the Turks. The absence of a centralized state in Iran can help explain why Mostowfi's cabinet, and the Shah, were both impotent on this matter.Touraj Atabaki, \\"Azerbaijan: Ethnicity and the Struggle for Power in Iran\\" (I.B.Tauris, 2000: 9781860645549), p. 40 In this second term Mostowfi also showed he was taking a stance in relation to the modernization of Iran. In the program of his second cabinet Mostowfi proposed the abolition of the old pensions system, completion of the new Code, the founding of a secular law school to train personnel for the Ministry of Justice, the founding of several schools for girls and new laws to govern telegraphic communications. These proposals were rejected by the Majlis in 1914.Touraj Atabaki, \\"Azerbaijan: Ethnicity and the Struggle for Power in Iran\\" (I.B.Tauris, 2000: 1860645542, 9781860645549), p. 54 Mostowfi was also elected as MP for Tehran, but resigned in order to become Prime Minister. His manifesto included several concepts that the Third Majlis passed including laws such as the Military Conscription Act, Ministry of Finance constitution bill and Real Estate tax law. Mostowfi resigned from his position after both his neutral and withdrawal of Russian forces policies failed.Touraj Atabaki ed., Iran and the First World War: Battleground of the Great Powers (I.B.Tauris, 2006: ), p. 10. =The Third Term= In August 1915, less than six months after resigning, Mostowfi once again was Prime Minister. By the time he took office, German popularity had increased amongst the nationalists.Touraj Atabaki ed., Iran and the First World War: Battleground of the Great Powers (I.B.Tauris, 2006: ), p. 11. During the Third Majlis the Czarist Russian Army expeditionary force left Qazvin for Tehran. Mostowfi therefore pursued a two edged policy. He began talks with the British for a loan and for the withdrawal of Russian forces. He also entered into secret negotiations with the Germans for a treaty of cooperation.Alexander Mikaberidze, \\"Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia\\" (ABC-CLIO, 2011: ), p. 411. Mostowfi suggested the Germans guarantee Iranian independence and territorial integrity. Mostowfi also attached a number of stipulations, including the Germans giving Iran a loan and providing officers. If these were all met, his government would be prepared to declare war on the Allies. He also stated that if all stipulations were not met he would have to stop all German activities in Iran. In a show of good faith the Germans secured the withdrawal of Ottoman Forces and offered to help financially but did not agree to the stipulations. Due to the non- committal answer firm the Germans, the negotiations did not lead to a policy that could be executed. Additionally the Allies had discovered the secret negotiations. By 7 November 1915, Russian troops were marching on the capital. The German envoy had left the day before and Mostowfi recommend that his deputies and the Shah to also leave and go to Qom. Forty-four deputies, newspaper editors and the Gendarmerie left for Qom. This was known as the ‚Äòemigration‚Äô with the hope of forming a government free of British and Russian Influence. The Shah having initially agreed, had his mind changed by the Russian and British Ministers in Tehran. With this change in mindset any chance of forming an independent government was gone. With the Shah in Tehran, Mostowfi tried to persuade the deputies to return. Mostowfi did not succeed in securing their return and so ended his third term.Touraj Atabaki ed., Iran and the First World War: Battleground of the Great Powers (I.B.Tauris, 2006: ), p. 11, 12. =The Fourth Term= Mostowfi's fourth term of office as Prime Minister was marked by severe drought and famine that devastated the country. By some accounts 25% of those living in the North perished.Global Connections . Timeline This was accompanied by the Persian influenza epidemic of 1918 which was rapid and devastating.George C. Kohn, Encyclopedia of Plague and Pestilence (Infobase Publishing, 2007: ), p. 299. =The Fifth Term= Mostowfi's fifth term began in January 1923. The First World War was over and the Russian Revolution was well established. Reza Khan who was then called Sardar Sepah had the post of Minister of War in Mostowfi's cabinet. One of his most formidable opponents in politics at the time was Hassan Modarres who made numerous efforts to pull down Mostowfi's cabinet. Mostowfi's cabinet finally collapsed under pressure from political opponents despite the full backing of Ahmad Shah Qajar. During the run-up to the elections for the 5th Majlis, Modarres and his followers in the Parliament were actively campaigning against Mostowfi's cabinet. They tabled a formal question to the government, which was customarily followed by a vote of confidence. The ministers answered the questions convincingly. Mostowfi, who was not used to this kind of street politics, was said to be angry and disappointed. He delivered his most famous speech to Parliament, blaming members of Parliament for \\"giving and taking ajil (dried nuts), which in Persian means giving and taking bribes. He is believed to have said, \\"I have problems with my digestive system, and I do not take or give any ajil\\". He was the first Prime Minister to call Parliamentarians corrupt instead of cajoling and flattering them. He and his ministers left the Parliament, went straight to the Shah and resigned. Hassan Modarres went on to abolish the 1919 accord between Iran and the Great Britain. =The Sixth Term= Despite his opposition to Mostowfi, Modarres was part of the party that encouraged Mostowfi to take his sixth term as Prime Minister. Reza Shah had been elected Shah and crowned. In order to legitimize his rule he needed a Prime Minister who had the confidence of the politicians and the general public, so he chose Mostowfi. Modarres believed that Mostowfi was one of the few people who might curb the excesses of the new Shah and his generals. Mostowfi's sixth began in June 1926. During this term of office a number of important actions were taken, the most important event during this period had been the abolition of Capitulation on 9 May 1927. This would be the last major event that Mostowfi would be part of and this would be his last post. At the end of May 1927, Mostowfi resigned from office and from political life. The Society for National Heritage The Society for National Heritage was formed in 1921 with the aim to preserve, protect and promote \\"Iran's patrimony\\".Talinn Grigor, '2004. \\"Recultivating \\"Good Taste\\": The Early Pahlavi Modernists and Their Society for National Heritage.\\" In Iranian Studies v. 37, n. 1, 17 The society built a state museum, a state library and several mausoleums, which incorporated motifs from ancient Iranian architecture. The society was formed by modernist government officials and Westernized intellectuals, and Mostowfi was among them.Hamid Naficy, A Social History of Iranian Cinema, Volume 1: The Artisanal Era, 1897‚Äì1941 (Duke University Press, 2011: ), p. 142.Ervand Abrahamian, \\"A History of Modern Iran\\" (Cambridge University Press, 2008: ), p. 87. Death and legacy Mirza Hassan Mostowfi al Mamalek died of a heart attack on 27 August 1932. He was buried in the family mausoleum in Vanak village. The funeral procession was marked by the Armenian residents of Vanak carrying the coffin for a mile to the Mausoleum, followed by a procession of 80 or more cars. The mausoleum is currently on the grounds of Alzahra University. Mostowfi had several children including a son, Mirza Yousof Mostowfi al-Mamalek II, who may have been named after his father.

Hassan Abad was built by Mirza Yousof Mostowfi al-Mamalek, Naser ed-Din Shah's vizier. He named the place after his son Mirza Hassan Mostofi al-Mamalek. It was inspired by the Renaissance architecture, and adapted from the works of Palladio, the famous Italian architect of the Renaissance period. Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the square was renamed to \\"31st of Shahrivar Square\\", however the new name did not stick and it is still known as the \\"Hassan Abad Square\\".

Geography Aneityum is the southernmost island of Vanuatu (not counting the Matthew and Hunter Islands, which are disputed with New Caledonia, but considered by the people of Aneityum Island part of their custom ownership). Its southeastern cape N√©tchan N√©ganneaing is the southernmost point of land in Vanuatu, more southerly than the southern satellite islet Inyeug. The latter, however, is surrounded by Intao Reef, that extends even further south, albeit submerged, thus being the southernmost feature of Vanuatu. The island is in size. It rises to an elevation of in Mount Inrerow Atamein. The larger of its two villages is Anelcauhat ( Anelghowhat), on the south side. Population Aneityum had a population of 915 in 2009.2009 Census Summary release final - Government of Vanuatu This population is believed to have been possibly more than 12,000 prior to the arrival of the Europeans, in 1793. However, introduced diseases and blackbirding played a major role in Aneityum's massive depopulation, which left the island with less than 200 inhabitants in 1930. The main language of Aneityum island is also called Aneityum, or AnejomÃÉ in the local orthography.  Traditional Chiefdoms  At the time of first contact with Europeans (around 1830) the island was subdivided into seven chiefdoms (nelcau) that each were presided by a natimarid (high chief) (clockwise, starting in Northwest:): *Anau-Unse (Annaunse) *Ijipdav (Epege) *Anetcho (Aneitio) *Anau- Unjai (Aname) *Anumej-Anekro (Annuantchai) *Umej (Umetch) *Anelcauhat The chiefdoms were further subdivided into more than 50 districts that were presided by minor chiefs (natimi alupas). The power of the chiefs was mainly of ritual nature.Matthew Spriggs: Population in a Vegetable Kingdom. Aneityum Island (Vanuatu) at European Contact in 1830. Kapitel 14 in Patrick V.

While the sinoatrial node typically regulates the heartbeat during normal sinus rhythm, PACs occur when another region of the atria depolarizes before the sinoatrial node and thus triggers a premature heartbeat. The exact cause of PACs is unclear; while several predisposing conditions exist, PACs commonly occur in healthy young and elderly people. Elderly people that get PACs usually don't need any further attention besides follow ups due to unclear evidence. PACs are often completely asymptomatic and may be noted only with Holter monitoring, but occasionally they can be perceived as a skipped beat or a jolt in the chest. In most cases, no treatment other than reassurance is needed for PACs, although medications such as beta blockers can reduce the frequency of symptomatic PACs.  Risk factors  Hypertension, or abnormally high blood pressure, often signifies an elevated level of both psychological and physiological stress. Often, hypertension goes hand in hand with various atrial fibrillations including premature atrial contractions (PACs). Additional factors that may contribute to spontaneous premature atrial contractions could be: * Increased age * Abnormal body height * History of cardiovascular disease (CV) * Abnormal ANP levels * Elevated cholesterol Diagnosis Premature atrial contractions are typically diagnosed with an electrocardiogram, Holter monitor, or cardiac event monitor. =Electrocardiogram= On an electrocardiogram (ECG), PACs are characterized by an abnormally shaped P wave. Since the premature beat initiates outside the sinoatrial node, the associated P wave appears different from those seen in normal sinus rhythm. Typically, the atrial impulse propagates normally through the atrioventricular node and into the cardiac ventricles, resulting in a normal, narrow QRS complex. However, if the atrial beat is premature enough, it may reach the atrioventricular node during its refractory period, in which case it will not be conducted to the ventricle and there will be no QRS complex following the P wave. Treatment Premature atrial contractions are often benign, requiring no treatment. Occasionally, the patient having the PAC will find these symptoms bothersome, in which case the doctor may treat the PACs. Sometimes the PACs can indicate heart disease or an increased risk for other cardiac arrhythmias. In this case the underlying cause is treated. Often a beta blocker will be prescribed for symptomatic PACs. Prognosis In otherwise healthy patients, occasional premature atrial contractions are a common and normal finding and do not indicate any particular health risk. Rarely, in patients with other underlying structural heart problems, PACs can trigger a more serious arrhythmia such as atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. In otherwise healthy people, PACs usually disappear with adolescence.  Supraventricular extrasystole  A supraventricular extrasystole (SVES) is an extrasystole or premature electrical impulse in the heart, generated above the level of the ventricle. This can be either a premature atrial contraction or a premature impulse from the atrioventricular node. SVES should be viewed in contrast to a premature ventricular contraction that has a ventricular origin and the associated QRS change. Instead of the electrical impulse beginning in the sinoatrial (SA) node and propagating to the atrioventricular (AV) node, the signal is conducted both to the ventricle and back to the SA node where the signal began.

Early life and education Mansfield's father, Harvey Mansfield Sr., had been editor of the American Political Science Review, and was the Ruggles Professor Emeritus of Public Law and Government at Columbia University at the time of his death in 1988 at the age of 83. Mansfield has been at Harvard since his own student days in 1949, having joined the faculty in 1962. He received his A.B. at Harvard in 1953, served in the United States Army in Virginia and France, and then received his Ph.D. from Harvard 1961. Personal life Mansfield was married to the late Delba Winthrop, with whom he co-translated and co-authored work on Tocqueville. Through his mother, Mansfield is a distant relative of the British actor Sam Claflin. Career =A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy= In his 2001 book A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy, Mansfield traces the history of political philosophy in \\"the great books\\" written by Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, and others of the \\"highest rank\\" (1).Harvey C. Mansfield, A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy (Wilmington, Delaware: ISI Books, 2001). . (Subsequent parenthetical references to this work follow in the text.) He also finds political philosophy in practical politics, which Mansfield considers necessarily partisan, because it involves citizens \\"arguing passionately pro and con with advocacy and denigration, accusation and defense\\" (2). He argues that politics does not merely consist of liberal and conservative options, but rather, they are fundamentally opposed to each other, with each side defending its own interest as it attempts to appeal to the common good (2). Since such adversarial sides in a political dispute appeal to the common good, an observer of the dispute can use his capacity to reason to judge which side supplies the most compelling arguments. If such an observer is competent to be a judge, he or she may be thought of as a political philosopher, or as at least on the way to engaging in political philosophy (2‚Äì3). Mansfield stresses the connection between politics and political philosophy, but he does not find political philosophy in political science, which for Mansfield is a rival to political philosophy and \\"apes\\" the natural sciences (3‚Äì5). From Mansfield's point of view, political science replaces words like \\"good\\", \\"just\\", and \\"noble\\" with other words like \\"utility\\" or \\"preferences.\\" The terms are meant to be neutral, but as a result of the political scientist's purported change of role and perspective from judge to so‚Äëcalled \\"disinterested observer\\", such a \\"scientist\\" is not able to determine whose arguments are the best, because he or she falls victim to relativism, which, according to Mansfield, is \\"a sort of lazy dogmatism\\" (4‚Äì5). In his guide, Mansfield reminds students that political science rebelled from political philosophy in the seventeenth century and declared itself distinct and separate in the positivist movement of the late nineteenth century: thus, he argues in it that whereas \\"Today political science is often said to be 'descriptive' or 'empirical,' concerned with facts; political philosophy is called 'normative' because it expresses values. But these terms merely repeat in more abstract form the difference between political science, which seeks agreement, and political philosophy, which seeks the best\\" (6). Furthermore, according to Mansfield, when people talk about the difference between political philosophy and political science, they are actually talking about two distinct kinds of political philosophy, one modern and the other ancient. The only way to understand modern political science and its ancient alternative fully, he stresses, is to enter the history of political philosophy, and to study the tradition handed down over the centuries: \\"No one can count himself educated who does not have some acquaintance with this tradition. It informs you of the leading possibilities of human life, and by giving you a sense of what has been tried and what is now dominant, it tells you where we are now in a depth not available from any other source\\" (7‚Äì8). Although modern political science feels no obligation to look at its roots, and might even denigrate the subject as if it could not be of any real significance, he says, \\"our reasoning shows that the history of political philosophy is required for understanding its substance\\" (7‚Äì8). =Scholarship= Western civilization In response to multiculturalism on college campuses, Mansfield has defended the importance of preserving and teaching courses on Western civilization, even proposing a survey course that selects a dozen or so books that capture the principal themes. Mansfield believes that understanding Western civilization is important because the books that explain it deal with problems associated with the human condition. Defense of the \\"strong executive\\" Mansfield has argued that the President of the United States has \\"extra-legal powers such as commanding the military, making treaties (and carrying on foreign policy), and pardoning the convicted, not to mention a veto of legislation\\", observing that the U.S. Constitution does not ask the President to take an oath to execute the laws, but rather, to execute \\"the office of the president, which is larger.\\"Harvey Mansfield, \\"The Law and the President: In a National Emergency, Who You Gonna Call?\\" The Weekly Standard, January 16, 2006, accessed February 5, 2007. Referring to domestic surveillance, Mansfield notes, \\"those arguing that the executive should be subject to checks and balances are wrong to say or imply that the president may be checked in the sense of stopped. The president can be held accountable and made responsible, but if he could be stopped, the Constitution would lack any sure means of emergency action. He defends the separation of powers, arguing that \\"the executive subordinated to the rule of law is in danger of being subordinate to the legislature.\\"Harvey C. Mansfield, \\"The Case for the Strong Executive: Under Some Circumstances, the Rule of Law Must Yield to the Need for Energy\\", Wall Street Journal, May 2, 2007, accessed June 17, 2007. Taming the Prince In his book Taming the Prince, Mansfield traces the modern doctrine of executive power to Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. He argues that executive power had to be tamed to become compatible with liberal constitutionalism. Gender roles and equality In his 2006 book Manliness, Mansfield defended a moderately conservative understanding of gender roles, and bemoaned the loss of the virtue of manliness in a \\"gender neutral\\" society. In a New York Times interview, he defined the concept briefly as \\"confidence in a situation of risk. A manly man has to know what he is doing.\\" He defines the idea in more concrete terms in the book. There, a manly man does not have to know what he is doing, but only has to act as though he does. Also in the book, Mansfield subjects the concept of manliness to a test in which he refers for support of his argument to such diverse authorities as Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Rudyard Kipling, Ernest Hemingway, and Naomi Wood. In his argument, manliness is ultimately related to assertiveness‚Äî\\"decisiveness without complete knowledge\\"‚Äîand its place in society is debated. In an interview with Bill Kristol, Mansfield said, \\"What I wrote was a modest defense of manliness. And the emphasis [is] on modest because manliness can be bad as well as good. Not everyone who takes risks deserves to have them turn out right and so manliness is, I think, responsible for a lot of evil. You can say that terrorists are manly, they‚Äôre willing to risk their lives and give their lives for a principle they believe in or a point they believe in.\\" Manliness was criticized by Martha Nussbaum in the June 22, 2006, issue of The New Republic. from The New Republic Nussbaum accuses Mansfield of misreading, or refusing to read, many feminist and nonfeminist texts. She argues that his book is based on overt misogynistic assumptions that take a position of indifference towards violence against women. Mansfield asserts, she contends, that a woman can resist rape only with the aid of \\"a certain ladylike modesty enabling her to take offense at unwanted encroachment\\". Concerning controversial comments by former President of Harvard, Lawrence Summers, about mental differences between men and women, Mansfield said that it is \\"probably true\\" that women \\"innately have less capacity than men at the highest level of science...It's common sense if you just look at who the top scientists are\\". In 1993, Mansfield testified on behalf of Colorado's Amendment 2, which amended the state constitution to prevent gays, lesbians and bisexuals from pursuing legal claims of discrimination. In his testimony, he argued that being gay \\"is not a life that makes for happiness,\\" that homosexuality is \\"shameful,\\" and that by not being able to have children gay people were not \\"socially responsible.\\" Nussbaum, who testified in the same trial against Amendment 2, later remarked that Mansfield's source for his claim that gay and lesbian people were unhappy was not contemporary social science research but the great books of the Western tradition (Plato, Tocqueville, Rousseau, etc.). Views on grades and affirmative action Mansfield has voiced criticism of grade inflation at Harvard University, which he claims is due in part to affirmative action.Harvey C. Mansfield, \\"Point of View: Grade Inflation: It's Time to Face the Facts\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education, April 6, 2001, accessed June 18, 2007. Mansfield also participated in a debate on affirmative action between Cornel West and Michael Sandel (arguing for affirmative action) with Ruth Wisse and himself (arguing against affirmative action). The debate attracted a \\"massive audience\\" of a thousand Harvard students, requiring its campus venue to be changed twice before it could take place on November 3, 1997, in Harvard's Sanders Theater, prompting Professor Sandel to comment, \\"'This puts to rest the myth that this generation has a political apathy, and apathy to political debates.'\\"As qtd. in Luke McLoughlin, \\"Walking the Walk: Dialogue Is Only a Prelude to Involvement\\" , archived issue of Digitas (Dec. 1997), accessed February 6, 2007. [Digitas is \\"a student organization dedicated to new technology\\" at Harvard University.] In 2013, Mansfield, after hearing from a dean that \\"the most frequent grade is an A\\", claimed to give students two grades: one for their transcript, and the one he thinks they deserve. He commented, \\"I didn‚Äôt want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade\\". In response to grade inflation, according to Harvard Crimson reporters Lulu Zhou and Rebecca D. O'Brien, Mansfield revived the \\"ironic\\" (or the \\"inflated\\") grade in 2006, in order to let his students know what they really deserved in his class without causing them harm by grading them lower than the other professors at Harvard: \\"In Mansfield‚Äôs 'true and serious' grading system, 5 percent of students will receive A‚Äôs, and 15 percent will receive A-minuses. But Mansfield won‚Äôt share those marks with anyone other than his teaching fellows and students. ... By contrast, Mansfield‚Äôs 'ironic' grade‚Äîthe only one that will appear on official transcripts‚Äîwill follow average grade distribution in the College, with about a quarter of students receiving A‚Äôs and another quarter receiving A-minu[s]es\\"; in contrast, their privately received deserved \\"real\\" (lower) grades usually centered around a C or C-minus, earning him the nickname \\"Harvey C-minus Mansfield.\\"Lulu Zhou, \\"'C-minus' Prof to Give More As\\", The Harvard Crimson, February 13, 2006, accessed February 9, 2007. \\"This [grading] policy‚Äîmeant to demonstrate the causes and effects of grade inflation‚Äîdrew heat from students and faculty, and attracted national media attention.\\"Rebecca D. O'Brien, \\"Professor Fights Grade Inflation, Affirmative Action\\", The Harvard Crimson, June 2, 2003, accessed February 6, 2007. Mansfield himself has joked that his middle initial \\"C.\\" stands for compassion: \\"That's what I lack when it comes to grading.\\" In an interview with the Hoover Institution, Mansfield claimed that college professors are too quick to label students as exceptional. Jefferson Lecture On May 8, 2007, Mansfield delivered the 36th Jefferson Lecture (\\"the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished intellectual and public achievement in the humanities\\", according to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which sponsored the lecture).\\"Harvey Mansfield, Noted American Author and Political Theorist, to Deliver the 2007 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities\\", press release, National Endowment for the Humanities, March 22, 2007.\\"About the Jefferson Lecture\\" , National Endowment for the Humanities, accessed June 16, 2007.Harvey C.

In his lecture, Mansfield suggests \\"two improvements for today‚Äôs understanding of politics arising from the humanities ... first ... to recapture the notion of thumos in Plato, and Aristotle... [and] ...second ... the use of names‚Äîproper to literature and foreign to science\\". This is a reference to his own philosophy, which forbids discounting the wisdom of the past simply because those who spoke it lived a long time ago.

Origins  Born in 1953 as the only son of Maharaja Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar and his second wife, Maharani Tripura Sundari Ammani, Srikantadatta Wadiyar succeeded his father as the head of the Wadiyar dynasty after his father's death on 9 September 1974. He continued the traditional customs of the royal family from 1974 until his death on 10 December 2013. Srikantadatta Wadiyar's wife, Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, adopted Yaduveer Gopalraj Urs, who was renamed Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, as her son, on 23 February 2015.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/I-am-eager-to-find-an-heir-at- the-earliest-Pramoda-Devi-Wadiyar/articleshow/42696509.cms  Education  260x260px Srikantadatta Wadiyar studied in the private royal school at the Mysore Palace and completed his secondary school education in 1967. He took horse riding lessons from the Government Riding School, Mysore. He had a British and an Anglo-Indian nanny who groomed him. Mr. Watsa was a mentor to him during his formative years. He joined Maharaja's College, Mysore, in 1968 to pursue his one-year pre-university course and later earned a degree in Bachelor of Arts in 1972, pursuing it from 1969 to 1972, majoring in the English literature and political science. His minor subject was sociology. His second language was Kannada, tutored by Prof. K. Venkataramappa. He did his master's degree in political science at Manasa Gangotri, University of Mysore, from 1972 to 1974. He studied a course in law as an open-university student. Throughout his college career, he was an avid cricketer and had a collection of cricket bats signed by international test cricket players. He also studied Western classical music and Carnatic classical music. In his youth, he had studied the Vedas as well. He was awarded gold medal for securing the first rank in Master of Arts in Political Science. His wife, Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, is a post-graduate in Hindi.  Personal life  259x259px His love of cricket led him to captain his university's team and later prompted his involvement in leading the Karnataka State Cricket Association as its president. He was married to Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, from the Bettada Kote Ursu family of the Mysore State. They had no children. Although he never had any legal or official title related to his role as head of the erstwhile royal family, people referred to him with respect and esteem as Maharaja. Wadiyar was the only brother of 5 sisters: Princesses Gayatri Devi, Meenakshi Devi, Kamakshi Devi, Indrakshi Devi, and, the youngest, Vishalakshi Devi. He celebrated the royal tradition of Mysore Dasara by performing all the rituals which were conducted by his ancestors‚Äîthe rulers of the erstwhile princely state of Mysore. He conducted a khasgi (private/special) durbar during the festivities, where he ascended the golden throne at the Amba Vilas Hall of the Mysore Palace.  Political career  Wadiyar was a longtime member of the Indian National Congress. He participated six times in elections for Member of Parliament representing the Mysore Parliamentary Constituency. He won four time as the INC member, and lost twice; once as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate and once more recently as a Congress party candidate. In 1984, Wadiyar first stood for Lok Sabha elections on an Indian National Congress ticket and defeated independent candidate K. P. Shantamurthy. He joined the BJP in 1991, but lost the elections badly to Chandraprabha Urs of the Congress. He moved back to the Congress Party, and won Lok Sabha elections in 1996 and 1999, but lost the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.  Death  On 10 December 2013, Wadiyar died from cardiac arrest aged 60 at Vikram Hospital, Bangalore. He was cremated with full state honours at Madhu Vana, the burial ground of the royal family. On the day of his demise, the whole city of Mysore shut its business voluntarily in respect. The Government of Karnataka declared a two-day mourning ceremony and a state government holiday. In addition, lighting of his Mysore Ambavilas Palace was halted for thirteen days as a symbol of grief. He was mourned by his wife Pramoda Devi Wadiyar.  Legacy  Wadiyar died without an heir; so, during the royal Dasara celebrations of 2014, his nephew Chaduranga Kantharaj Urs performed the rituals while the \\"khasgi\\" (private) durbar was conducted by placing the \\"Pattada Katti\\" (royal sword) on the throne. The Karnataka State Cricket Association, of which Wadiyar was elected president just a few days before his death, named the Karnataka Premier League tournament after him. The University of Mysore Platinum Jubilee Cricket Stadium, later known as Gangotri Glades Cricket Ground, was named in Srikantadatta Wadiyar's memory. A sand sculpture of Srikantadatta Wadiyar was etched. A wax sculpture of his like was also created by wax-sculptor Shreeji Bhaskaran. In 2014, India Posts issued a special cover depicting the private durbar of Srikantadatta Wadiyar. His wife Pramoda Devi Wadiyar became his successor and legal heir. She adopted Yaduveer Gopalraj Urs in February 2015 as her son and renamed him Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar. She conducted the anointment ceremony of her son, thereby delegating him to conduct and continue the religious rituals as per customs of the Wadiyar family.  Atheism  Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar said in an interview that he was an atheist for a brief period. He then resumed his Hindu theistic principles.

Sexual harassment allegations Amazon producer Isa Dick Hackett reported through The Hollywood Reporter on October 12, 2017 that Roy Price, the programming chief at Amazon, had sexually harassed her at the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con. Hackett stated that Price aggressively asked her for sex in a taxi, which was the first time they'd met. Michael Paull, a top executive at Amazon, was in the taxi with them at the time. Later that night, Price allegedly yelled sexual propositions into Hackett's ear while she was in a conversation with other Amazon executives. Hackett also alleged that Price had failed to take action when another actress, Rose McGowan told him she was sexually assaulted by producer Harvey Weinstein. The Information had previously published, on August 25, a report revealing that Amazon had investigated a sexual harassment complaint from Hackett. After The Hollywood Reporter's publication of Hackett's accusations, Amazon suspended Price. On October 16, 2017, Price's fianc√©e, Lila Feinberg, announced that she was calling off their wedding. Her dress was designed by Georgina Chapman, the wife of Harvey Weinstein, the later of whom was similarly involved in sexual harassment claims.

Operated by the United States Navy, Red Hill supports U.S. military operations in the Pacific. Unlike any other facility in the United States, Red Hill can store up to 250 million gallons of fuel. It consists of 20 steel- lined underground storage tanks encased in concrete, and built into cavities that were mined inside of Red Hill. Each tank has a storage capacity of approximately 12.5 million gallons. The Red Hill tanks are connected to three gravity-fed pipelines that run 2.5 miles inside a tunnel to fueling piers at Pearl Harbor. Each of the 20 tanks at Red Hill measures 100 feet in diameter and is 250 feet in height. Red Hill is located under a volcanic mountain ridge near Honolulu. It was declared a Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1995.  History  Above-ground fuel storage tanks at Pearl Harbor prior to the construction of Red Hill. Before the United States entered World War II, the Roosevelt Administration became concerned about the vulnerability of the many above-ground fuel storage tanks at Pearl Harbor. In 1940 it decided to build a new underground facility that would store more fuel and be safe from an enemy aerial attack. = Construction = The Red Hill site would provide unprecedented flow rates of fuel due to its elevation. In addition, the site's unique geological characteristics, including basalt rock, could support such large tanks. Federal, local government and contracted engineers and geologists performed many surveys of the Koolau Range and eventually reached a consensus on Red Hill as the best choice because it is mostly homogeneous basalt. Their original plan was to build four large underground tanks. These would be horizontal, as all underground tanks were at the time. However, during the planning process, the engineers decided to build the tanks vertically because construction and excavation could occur simultaneously. This was possible because a vertical shaft drilled through the centerline of the tank would allow excavated rock to funnel down onto a series of conveyor belts in the lower access tunnel. Planners and engineers began the process by acquiring the real estate, staging equipment and materials, and building a work camp. The 3,900 workers worked around the clock, seven days a week, to complete the project. Construction started by excavating the vertical shafts for all 20 tanks concurrently with mining of the upper access and lower access tunnels. The tunnels were aligned directly in the middle of the parallel rows of shafts. Once perpendicular to the shafts, cross tunnels were mined to connect the shafts to the main access tunnels. For constructability and safety reasons (cave-ins), the upper domes needed to be built first, so the miners excavated individual ring tunnels around the circumference of each of the future upper dome bases. They then scoped out the area of the domes and proceeded to construct the steel framing, steel liner and rebar. Workers continuously poured concrete that ranged in thickness from two feet at the crown to eight feet at the base. Once the concrete cured, it was pre-stressed by pressure grouting the area between the concrete and the basalt. leftUpon completion of the excavation, workers erected a steel tower in the center to the full height of 250 feet. The tower served to support concrete chutes, pipes, booms, and other equipment necessary to install the piping, concrete, and steel linings. Workers then began to erect the steel liner and rebar incrementally so that they could pour concrete in stages. Concrete was poured continually and workers had to remove wooden shoring as concrete filled. They injected pressurized grout to pre-stress the concrete by filling void space between the concrete and the gunite. When finished, the tanks were tested by slowly filling them with water while laborers in boats physically checked the entire surface area of the steel liner. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor took place during the construction of Red Hill. As a result, a portion of the site was used to bury a large number of the fatalities. Those not claimed by families were moved to the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific when it opened after the war. The Department of Defense has spent more than $200 million on continual technological modernization and environmental testing at Red Hill since 2006. The facility monitors the fuel level in each tank to one sixteenth of an inch and controls the movement of fuel throughout the facility. If a tank level decreases by as little as half an inch, alarms will sound in Red Hill's control room, which is continuously staffed. Environmental Impact = Groundwater Protection Plan = Many entities, including the U.S. Navy, University of Hawaii, and U.S. Geological Survey, study the movement of groundwater in and around Red Hill. Navy modeling to date indicates any fuel constituents in the groundwater are ‚Äúnot likely‚Äù to reach any of Oahu's drinking water sources. Timeline of actions taken by the U.S. Navy: * 2005: Quarterly groundwater monitoring and sampling at the Red Hill Facility. * 2007: Environmental investigation to collect additional data for groundwater and contaminant fate (how and where it disperses) and transport modeling in order to provide better understanding and forecasting of potential impacts; contingency plan to protect drinking water well located closest to Red Hill. * 2008: The Groundwater Protection Plan (subsequently updated in 2009 and 2014) to mitigate risk associated with inadvertent fuel releases from the tanks. It included the follow provisions: * A tank inspection and maintenance program * A soil vapor monitoring program to support primary leak detection processes * A groundwater sampling and risk assessment reporting program * A long-term groundwater monitoring program that provides warning of potential risk to human health * Responsibilities and response actions that will be performed should groundwater data exceed Hawaii Department of Health environmental action levels. * Periodic market surveys to evaluate best available leak detection technologies for large, field-constructed fuel storage facilities. = Fuel Spills = In December 2013, contractors completed a three-year, scheduled, routine maintenance upgrade on tank 5 at Red Hill. This work included cleaning, inspecting, and repairing anomalies. At the conclusion of the overhaul in January 2014, the Navy initiated a Return to Service evolution, refilling the tank with jet fuel (JP-8). During this process, the inventory management alarms sounded. Red Hill operators first assumed the alarm system was malfunctioning or producing false positives because the tank was recently overhauled and should not have been leaking. Eventually, the U.S. Navy determined the alarms were not false and reported a 27,000 gallon jet fuel loss to the Hawaii Department of Health and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Inside Red Hill Fuel Storage Facility. Subsequent analysis indicated that the leak was the result of faulty work and poor quality control by the Navy's contractor, compounded by a lack of quality assurance oversight by the Navy, as well as operator error. As a consequence, the Navy, in accordance with the Administrative Order on Consent, significantly improved the tank inspection, repair, and maintenance processes in their report submitted on October 11, 2016. Regarding the 27,000 gallons of fuel, the Navy's first concern was the possibility of fuel entering the drinking water supply. The nearest drinking water shaft (operated by the Navy) is 3,000 feet away and is one source that provides water to the military families at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The next closest drinking water shaft, Halawa shaft, which is located approximately one mile away, provides drinking water to the city of Honolulu. While all test results for contamination at the Navy drinking water shaft have come back well within safe drinking water standards and results from the Halawa shaft have shown no jet fuel related contaminants, the Navy, the Environmental Protection Administration, and the Hawaii Department of Health conducted studies to evaluate groundwater conditions and any potential impacts to groundwater resources in the area. Results taken in and around Tank 5 indicated a spike in levels of hydrocarbons in soil vapor and groundwater. Drinking water monitoring results confirmed compliance with federal and state safety standards for drinking water both before and after the January 2014 release. Following the tank 5 release in 2014, the Navy increased the testing frequency for drinking water and groundwater wells. The Navy now sends drinking water samples every quarter to certified independent laboratories that use EPA methods to analyze for contamination. The newest groundwater monitoring well was scheduled to come on line by the end of April 2017. Commander Navy Region Hawaii and Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific, Admiral Fuller noted, \\"there are have been detects of trace amounts of fuel constituents near the Navy drinking water shaft.\\" This is in the groundwater, not the drinking water. \\"We're talking 17 parts per billion, as opposed to zero. The misperception is that there's a spike, but the numbers were small enough that the testing facility had to estimate the amount because the numbers were so low. The 17 parts per billion is below the threshold of something we should be concerned about, which is 100 parts per billion.\\" = Administrative Order on Consent = The Administrative Order on Consent is a binding legal agreement administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. The order mandates the corrective actions to be taken in the wake of an environmental violation. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Administration, Hawaii Department of Health, U.S. Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency signed the order for Red Hill in September 2015. It acknowledges the shared responsibility to protect Oahu's drinking water supply and maintain Red Hill as a strategically vital resource. The Environmental Protection Administration and Hawaii Department of Health negotiated the administrative order with the U.S. Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency in response to the January 2014 fuel release from the facility. The order required the Navy and Defense Logistics Agency to take actions, subject to approval by the Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Administration, to address fuel releases and implement infrastructure improvements to protect human health and the environment. The order requires the Navy to evaluate and improve procedures and practices to maintain the integrity of the tanks, evaluate and implement structural upgrades to the tanks, and to use the best technology available to detect leaks. The order also requires the Navy to determine the overall risk the facility poses to the surrounding environment. The document prescribes actions the U.S. Navy must take, along with deadlines for completing each task. There are eight sections: # Overall project maintenance guidance # Tank inspection, repair, and maintenance # Potential tank upgrade review procedures # Leak detection and testing # Current and future corrosion and metal fatigue # Investigating and remediating past fuel releases # Development of future groundwater protection and evaluation # Risk and vulnerability assessment of Red Hill The Hawaii Department of Health hosted a second meeting to address the document in May 2016. Participants included the Defense Logistics Agency and Environmental Protection Administration as well as subject matter experts from the University of Hawaii, the Honolulu Board of Water Supply and their consultants, the State Department of Land and Natural Resources, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The Environmental Protection Administration and Hawaii Department of Health hired a team of world renowned subject matter experts to assess the entire Red Hill facility and went on record to say that all aspects‚Äîto include infrastructure, security measures, and operation practices‚Äîcurrently meet or exceed industry standards. = Follow on Investigation and Remediation = The Administrative Order on Consent required the Navy to develop a plan addressing the January 2014 fuel release from Tank #5 as well as plans to address any future releases of fuel. The Navy will evaluate various investigative techniques to determine which are most suitable for determining the extent of contamination in the ground around Red Hill. Each technique will be evaluated in terms of feasibility of implementation and effectiveness in detecting light non-aqueous phase liquid, which refers to fuel floating on top of the groundwater. The Navy will also investigate a number of remediation methods for use in the Red Hill area. The Navy will evaluate methods based on their feasibility of implementation, suitableness for use in fractured basalt geology, and effectiveness in reducing contamination. In May 2016 the Navy submitted a scope of work to address the investigation and remediation of contamination, modeling and the groundwater monitoring network. On September 15, 2016 the regulatory agencies disapproved this scope of work and requested that the Navy revise the document (review and disapproval letter is available in the additional documents page, see link above). The Navy submitted a revised scope of work on November 5, 2016 which was conditionally approved by the regulatory agencies on December 2, 2016 subject to changes as detailed in the conditional approval letter (letter is available for viewing below). On January 5, 2017, the Navy submitted a new version of the Section 6 & 7 Scope of Work, available below, that addressed all of the issues noted in the Conditional Approval letter.  Controversy  = Public Concern = The Honolulu Civil Beat reported that even though Navy and state health officials have known about the groundwater contamination since the late 1990s ‚Äî and generated thousands of pages of reports on the topic ‚Äî officials from Honolulu's Board of Water Supply say they were never informed about the problems until after this most recent spill. The Honolulu Board of Water Supply is responsible for purveying the county's drinking water. \\"I'm very concerned about the situation,\\" said Ernest Lau, manager and chief engineer for the Honolulu Board of Water Supply. He stressed that the nearby aquifers are critical to Oahu's drinking water supply. The Environmental Protection Agency says millions of gallons of fuel stored in a military facility under Red Hill is unlikely to reach the water supply. \\"It's very unlikely that that contamination, that mass we're seeing under the tanks, gets anywhere near the Board of Water Supply wells,\\" Steven Linder, of the Environmental Protection Administration, told the state Health Department's Underground Fuel Tank Advisory Committee. The Sierra Club of Hawaii launched a \\"Fix it up or shut it down\\" petition and has also demanded that the Hawaii Department of Health, the Environmental Protection Administration, and the U.S. Navy: * Install sufficient \\"sentinel\\" monitoring wells to guard public drinking water sources from possible contamination currently in the aquifer, * Locate the fuel that has already leaked from the storage facility and clean it up, * Install genuine leak prevention systems, not only leak detection systems, that will guarantee there will be no future leaks from this facility. = SB 1259 = Senate Bill 1259 titled Relating to Underground Storage Tanks requires, on or before 9/1/2018, that the Department of Health adopt rules for underground storage tanks and tank systems to conform to certain federal regulations and that include additional requirements for field-constructed underground storage tanks and tank systems. The bill was introduced on January 25, 2017 and was eventually tabled.

It is approved for use after the first MS event. Closely related is interferon beta 1a, also indicated for MS, with a very similar drug profile. Mechanism of action Interferon beta balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the blood brain barrier. Overall, therapy with interferon beta leads to a reduction of neuron inflammation. Moreover, it is also thought to increase the production of nerve growth factor and consequently improve neuronal survival. Side effects Injectable medications can produce irritation or bruises at injection site. The bruise depicted was produced by a subcutaneous injection. Interferon beta-1b is available only in injectable forms, and can cause skin reactions at the injection site that may include cutaneous necrosis. Skin reactions vary greatly in their clinical presentation. They usually appear within the first month of treatment albeit their frequence and importance diminish after six months of treatment. Skin reactions are more prevalent in women. Mild skin reactions usually do not impede treatment whereas necroses appear in around 5% of patients and lead to the discontinuation of the therapy. Also over time, a visible dent at the injection site due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons, a subclass of cytokines, are produced in the body during illnesses such as influenza in order to help fight the infection. They are responsible for many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, recommendation is that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons. The injection-site reactions can be mitigated by rotating injection sites or by using one of the medications that requires less frequent injections. Side effects are often onerous enough that many patients ultimately discontinue taking Interferons (or glatiramer acetate, a comparable disease-modifying therapies requiring regular injections). Efficacy = Clinically isolated syndrome = The earliest clinical presentation of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is the clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, a single attack of a single symptom. During a CIS, there is a subacute attack suggestive of demyelination but the patient does not fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Treatment with interferons after an initial attack decreases the risk of developing clinical definite MS. = Relapsing- remitting MS = Medications are modestly effective at decreasing the number of attacks in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interferons reduce relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon. They can be classified in genetic, pharmacological and pathogenetic non-responders. One of the factors related to non-respondance is the presence of high levels of interferon beta neutralizing antibodies. Interferon therapy, and specially interferon beta-1b, induces the production of neutralizing antibodies, usually in the second 6 months of treatment, in 5 to 30% of treated patients. Moreover, a subset of RRMS patients with specially active MS, sometimes called \\"rapidly worsening MS\\" are normally non-responders to interferon beta-1b. While more studies of the long-term effects of the drugs are needed, some data on the effects of interferons indicate that early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and it is related to better outcomes. More recent data suggest that interferon betas does not hasten disability. Interferon-Œ≤ exacerbates Th17-mediated inflammatory disease. Commercial formulations Betaferon/Betaseron is marketed today by Bayer Pharma. The originator was Schering AG (Berlex in North America), now part of Bayer Pharms. Novartis has also introduced Extavia, a new brand of interferon beta-1b, in 2009.

After the construction of the Otu Barrage, the downstream Hakra river dried up fully but subsurface flow is maintained to the Nara river which becomes later the delta channel of the Indus River before joining the sea via Kori Creek in Gujarat state. A paper published in Nature journal in 2017 asserts that the Ghaggar-Hakra paleochannel was fed by the Himalayan Sutlej River. The initial abandonment by the river Sutlej started about 15,000 years ago, with complete avulsion to its current course shortly after 8,000 years ago. The basin is classified in two parts, Khadir and Bangar, the higher area that is not flooded in rainy season is called Bangar and the lower flood-prone area is called Khadar.HaryanaOnline - Geography of Haryana Most sites of the Mature Harappan Civilisation (aka Indus Valley Civilisation) (2600-1900 BCE) are actually found along the (dried-out) bed of the Ghaggar-Hakkar, while the Late Harappan Civilisation was centered on the upper Ghaggar-Hakkar and the lower Indus. Recent geophysical research shows that during the mature time of the Harappan Civilisation, the Ghaggar-Hakra system became a system of monsoon-fed rivers, after the course change of Sutlej river about 8,000 years ago. The Indus Valley Civilisation declined when the monsoons that fed the rivers diminished at around some 4,000 years ago. Subatlantic aridification subsequently reduced the Ghaggar-Hakra to the seasonal river it is today. Nineteenth and early 20th century scholars, but also some more recent authors, have suggested that the Ghaggar-Hakra might be the defunct remains of the Sarasvati River mentioned in the Rig Veda, fed by Himalayan-fed rivers which changed their course due to tectonics. River course =Ghaggar River= The Ghaggar river flows into the Ottu reservoir, afterwards it becomes the Hakra river Ghaggar in Haryana Ghaggar river dry bed in February month near Naurangdesar village, Hanumangarh district, Rajasthan, India. alt=Ghaggar river in September, near Anoopgarh Ghaggar river, near Anoopgarh, Rajasthan in the month of September The Ghaggar is an intermittent river in India, flowing during the monsoon rains. It originates in the village of Dagshai in the Shivalik Hills of Himachal Pradesh at an elevation of above mean sea level and flows through Punjab and Haryana states into Rajasthan; just southwest of Sirsa, Haryana and by the side of Talwara Lake in Rajasthan. Dammed at Ottu barrage near Sirsa, Ghaggar feeds two irrigation canals that extend into Rajasthan. =Tributaries of the Ghaggar= The main tributaries of the Ghaggar are the Kaushalya river, Markanda, Sarsuti, Tangri and Chautang. The Kaushalya river is a tributary of Ghaggar river on the left side of Ghahhar-Hakra, it flows in the Panchkula district of Haryana state of India and confluences with Ghaggar river near Pinjore just downstream of Kaushalya Dam.Hillsofmorni.com - Kaushalya dam =Hakra River= The Hakra is the dried- out channel of a river near Fort Abbas City in Pakistan that is the continuation of the Ghaggar River in India. Several times, but not continuously, it carried the water of the Sutlej and Ghaggar during the Bronze Age period.Mughal 1997 Many early settlements of the Indus Valley Civilisation have been found in this area. Hakra Ware culture is believed to be the earliest pre-Harappan culture of India. Many early settlements are found along the river beds in this area. Hakra or Hakro Darya streamed through Sindh and its sign can be found in Sindh areas such as Khairpur, Nawabshah, Sanghar and Tharparkar. Along the course of the Ghaggar-Hakra river, there are many early archaeological sites belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization; but not further south than the middle of Bahawalpur district. It has been assumed that the Sarasvati ended there in a series of terminal lakes, and some think that its water only reached the Indus or the sea in very wet rainy seasons. However, satellite images seem to contradict this: they do not show subterranean water in reservoirs in the dunes between the Indus and the end of the Hakra west of Fort Derawar/Marot. Palaeogeography =Post-Ice Age= The wide river bed (paleo-channel) of the Ghaggar river suggests that the river once flowed full of water during the great meltdown of the Himalayan Ice Age glaciers at the end of the Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago, and that it then continued through the entire region, in the presently dry channel of the Hakra River, possibly emptying into the Rann of Kutch. According to Mugal the Sutlej may have flowed periodically into the Ghaggar-Hakra river bed. Mista suggested the same possibility for the Yamuna.V. N. Misra in Gupta 1995, p. 149 Analysis of sand grains using optically stimulated luminescence by Ajit Singh and others in 2017 indicated that the paleochannel of the Ghaggar-Hakra is a former course of the Sutlej, which diverted to its present course before the development of the Harappan Civilisation. The abandonment of this older course by the Sutlej started 15,000 years ago, and was complete by 8,000 years ago. Ajit Singh et al. conclude that the urban populations settled not along a perennial river, but a monsoon-fed seasonal river that was not subject to devastating floods. =Drying-up of the Hakra= Mughal, summing up the evidence, concludes that during the Bronze Age the Ghaggar-Hakra sometimes carried more, sometimes less water. Satellite photography has shown that the Ghaggar-Hakra was a large river that dried up several times. The latter point agrees with a recent isotope study.Tripathi et al. (2004) According to M. R. Mughal, the Hakkra dried-up at the latest in 1900 BCE, but other scholars conclude that it took place much earlier.Mughal, M.R. (1997, 2004). Ancient Cholistan. Archaeology and Architecture. Rawalpindi-Lahore-Karachi: Ferozsons Henri-Paul Francfort, utilizing images from the French satellite SPOT two decades ago, found that the large river Sarasvati is pre-Harappan altogether, and started drying up already in the middle of the 4th millennium BCE; during Harappan times only a complex irrigation-canal network was being used. The date should therefore be pushed back to 3800 BCE. Paleobotanical information documents the aridity that developed after the drying up of the river.Gadgil and Thapar (1990), and references therein Most of the Mature Harappan sites are located in the middle Ghaggar-Hakra river valley, and some on the Indus and in Kutch-Saurashtra. However, just as in other contemporary cultures, such as the BMAC, settlements move up-river due to climate changes around 2000 BCE. In the late Harappan period the number of late Harappan sites in the middle Ghaggar-Hakra channel and in the Indus valley diminishes, while it expands in the upper Ghaggar-Sutlej channels and in Saurashtra. Painted Grey Ware sites ( 1000‚Äì600 BCE) have been found at former IVC-sites at the middle and upper Ghaggar-Hakra channel, and have also been found in the bed and not on the banks of the Ghaggar-Hakra river, which suggests that river was certainly dried up by this period.Bryant (2001) p. 168 The sparse distribution of the Painted Gray Ware sites in the Ghaggar river valley indicates that during this period the Ghaggar river had already dried up. =Diminishing of the monsoons= The loss of rainfall in much of its catchment area, due to a change in the monsoons, was the primary cause of the drying-up of the Hakkar, while deforestation and overgrazing may also have contributed to the drying up of the river. A similar phenomenon, caused by climate change, is also seen at about the same period north of the Hindu Kush, in the area of the Bactria- Margiana Archaeological Complex. Late in the 2nd millennium BCE the Ghaggar- Hakra fluvial system dried up, which affected the Harappan civilisation. Giosan et al., in their study Fluvial landscapes of the Harappan civilisation, make clear that the Ghaggar-Hakra fluvial system was not a large glacier-fed Himalayan river, but a monsoonal-fed river. They concluded that the Indus Valley Civilisation died out because the monsoons, which fed the rivers that supported the civilisation, diminished. With the rivers drying out as a result, the civilisation diminished some 4000 years ago. This particular effected the Ghaggar-Hakra system, which became ephemeral and was largely abandoned. The Indus Valley Civilisation had the option to migrate east toward the more humid regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plain, where the decentralized late Harappan phase took place. Most of the Harappan sites along the Ghaggar- Hakkra are found in desert country, and have remained undisturbed since the end of the Indus Civilization. This contrasts with the heavy alluvium of the Indus and other large Panjab rivers that have obscured Harappan sites, including part of Mohenjo Daro. About 80 percent of the Ghaggar-Hakkra sites are datable to the fourth or third millennium BCE, suggesting that the river was flowing during (part of) this period, which is also indicated by the fact that some Indus sites are found inside the bed of the Ghaggar-Hakra. Identification with the Rigvedic Sarasvati River Since the 19th century, proposals have been made to identify the mythological Sarasvati River with the Ghaggar-Hakra River. The Sarasvati is often mentioned in the Rig Veda, which describes it as a mighty river located between the Indus and the Ganges, while later Vedic texts describe it as disappearing in the desert. Arguments have been made that the Ghaggar-Hakra was such a mighty river, due to tributaries which were supposed to receive snow melt waters from the Himalayas. Yet, more recent research shows that the Ghaggar-Hakra was monsoon-fed during Harappan times, and had already dried-up during Vedic times. =Rig Veda= The Sarasvati River is mentioned in all books of the Rigveda except the fourth. It is the only river with hymns entirely dedicated to it: RV 6.61, RV 7.95 and RV 7.96. It is mentioned as a divine and large river, which flows \\"from the mountains to the samudra,\\" which some take as the Indian Ocean. The Rig Veda was composed during the latter part of the late Harappan period, and according to Shaffer, the reason for the predominance of the Sarasvati in the Rig Veda is the late Harappan (1900‚Äì1300 BCE) population shift eastwards to Haryana. The identification with the Sarasvati River is based on the mentions in Vedic texts, e.g. in the enumeration of the rivers in Rigveda 10.75.05; the order is Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Sutudri, Parusni. Later Vedic texts record the river as disappearing at Vinasana (literally, \\"the disappearing\\") or Upamajjana, and in post-Vedic texts as joining both the Yamuna and Ganges as an invisible river at Prayaga (Allahabad). Some claim that the sanctity of the modern Ganges is directly related to its assumption of the holy, life-giving waters of the ancient Saraswati River. The Mahabharata says that the Sarasvati River dried up in a desert (at a place named Vinasana or Adarsana).Mahabharata 3.80.118, 3.130.3‚Äì4, 6.7.47, 9.34.81, 9.36.1‚Äì2 =Identification= Nineteenth and early 20th century scholars, such as orientalist Christian Lassen (1800-1876), philologist and Indologist Max M√ºller (1823-1900),Sacred Books of the East, 32, 60 archaeologist Aurel Stein (1862-1943), and geologist R. D. Oldham (1858-1936),Oldham 1893 pp.51‚Äì52 had considered that the Ghaggar-Hakra might be the defunct remains of a river, the Sarasvati, invoked in the orally transmitted collection of ancient Sanskrit hymns, the Rig Veda composed circa 1500 BCE to 1200 BCE. More recently, but writing before Giosan's 2012 publication, several scholars have identified the old Ghaggar-Hakra River with the Vedic Sarasvati River and the Chautang with the Drishadvati River. Such scholars include Gregory Possehl, J. M. Kenoyer, Bridget and Raymond Allchin, Kenneth Kennedy, Franklin Southworth, and numerous Indian archaeologists. Gregory Possehl and Jane McIntosh refer to the Ghaggar-Hakra River as \\"Sarasvati\\" throughout their respective 2002 and 2008 books on the Indus Civilisation, and Gregory Possehl states: Because most of the Indus Valley sites known so far are actually located on the Ghaggar-Hakra river and its tributaries and not on the Indus river, some Indian archaeologists, such as S.P. Gupta, have proposed to use the term \\"Indus Sarasvati Civilization\\" to refer to the Harappan culture which is named, as is common in archaeology, after the first place where the culture was discovered. =Tectonics= Some paleo-environmental scientists have proposed that the Hakkra was fed by Himalayan sources, which made it a mighty river, but dried-up between 2500 BCE and 1900 BCE, due to tectonic disturbances which caused a tilt in topography of Northwest India, resulting in the migration of rivers. According to this theory, the Sutlej moved westward and became a tributary of the Indus River, while the Yamuna moved eastward and became a tributary of the Ganges, supposedly in the early 2nd millennium BCE, while reaching its current bed by 1st millennium BCE. The Drishadvati bed retained only a small seasonal flow. The water loss due to these movements caused the Ghaggar-Hakra river to dry up in the Thar Desert. Anthropologists Gregory Possehl (1942‚Äì2011), J. M. Kenoyer, and professional archaeological writer, Jane McIntosh, have suggested that many religious and literary invocations to Sarasvati in the Rig Veda were to a real Himalayan river, whose waters, on account of seismic events, were diverted, leaving only a seasonal river, the Ghaggar-Hakra, in the original river bed. =Objections= Romila Thapar terms the identification \\"controversial\\" and dismisses it, noticing that the descriptions of Sarasvati flowing through the \\"high mountains\\" does not tally with Ghaggar's course and suggests that Sarasvati is Haraxvati of Afghanistan which is also known as the Helmand river. Wilke suggests that the identification is problematic since the Ghaggar-Hakra river was already dried up at the time of the composition of the Vedas, let alone the migration of the Vedic people into northern India. The idea that the Ghaggar-Hakra was fed by Himalayan sources has been contradicted by recent geophysical research, which shows that the Ghaggar-Hakra system, although having greater discharge in Harappan times which was enough to sustain human habitation, was not sourced by the glaciers and snows of the Himalayas, but rather by a system of perennial monsoon-fed rivers. Geologist Liviu Giosan of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and his team showed that in contrast to all Himalayan rivers in the region that dug out wide valleys in their own sediments as the monsoon declined, no such valley exists between the Sutlej and the Yamuna, demonstrating that neither the Ghaggar- Hakra nor any other Sarasvati candidate in that region had a Himalayan source. Late Holocene aridification subsequently reduced the Ghaggar-Hakra to the seasonal river it is today. Clift et al. (2012), using dating of zircon sand grains, have shown that subsurface river channels near the Indus Valley Civilisation sites in Cholistan immediately below the dry Ghaggar-Hakra bed show sediment affinity not with the Ghagger-Hakra, but instead with the Beas River in the western sites and the Sutlej and the Yamuna in the eastern ones, further weakening the hypothesis that the Ghaggar-Hakra was once a large river, but suggesting that the Yamuna itself, or a channel of the Yamuna, along with a channel of the Sutlej may have flowed west some time between 47,000 BCE and 10,000 BCE, well before the beginnings of Indus civilization. Ajit Singh et al. (2017) show that the paleochannel of the Ghaggar-Hakra is a former course of the Sutlej, which diverted to its present course between 15,000 and 8,000 years ago, well before the development of the Harappan civilisation. Ajit Singh et al. conclude that the urban populations settled not along a perennial river, but a monsoon-fed seasonal river that was not subject to devastating floods. Rajesh Kocchar further notes that, even if the Sutlej and the Yamuna had drained into the Ghaggar during Vedic period, it still would not fit the Rig Vedic descriptions because \\"the snow-fed Satluj and Yamuna would strengthen [only the] lower Ghaggar. [The] upper Ghaggar would still be as puny as it is today.\\" =Helmand River= Astrophysicist Rajesh Kocchar claims that there are two Sarasvati rivers mentioned in the Rigveda. The older one described in the family books of the Rigveda, which he calls Naditama Sarasvati, drains into a samudra. The newer one described in the tenth book of Rigveda as well as later Vedic texts, which he calls Vinasana Sarasvati, disappears in the sands. The Vinasana Sarasvati has been \\"accepted by all\\" to be the same as the Ghaggar-Hakra river. On the other hand, the description of the Naditama Sarasvati in the Rigveda matches the physical features of the Helmand River in Afghanistan, more precisely its tributary the Harut River, whose older name was Haraxvatƒ´ in Avestan. Ganga and Yamuna, he takes to be small streams in its vicinity. When the Vedic people moved east into Punjab, they named the new rivers they encountered after the old rivers they knew from Helmand.Rajesh Kocchar, The rivers Sarasvati: Reconciling the sacred texts, blog post based on The Vedic People: Their History and Geography.

Borrell was first seen acting as Count during the reign of his father Sunyer II in 945 at the consecration of the nunnery church of Sant Pere de les Puelles in Barcelona. In 947, Sunyer retired to monastic life and ceded the government of his realms jointly to his sons Borrell and Mir√≥ I. In 948, Borrell inherited Urgell from his uncle Sunifred II.An old historiography confuses Borrell's father Sunyer with Sunifred I Count of Cerdanya (928-66).

Sunyer died in 950, and Mir√≥ died in 966, leaving Borrell sole ruler of more than half of Old Catalonia, a status which led outsiders and flatterers to refer to him as dux Gothiae, \\"Duke of Gothia\\".

D. thesis, University of London, 2005, pp. 192‚Äì93. History Borrell was the son of Sunyer. In 967 he married Letgarda, who is speculated to have been daughter of a Count of Toulouse or Rouergue based on the names given to her children. By her Borrell had two sons and two daughters: Ramon Borrell (972-1017), Ermengol (974‚Äì1010), Ermengarda and Richilda. After Letgarda's death circa 986, he married Eimeruda, perhaps of Auvergne in 987. Borrell's military career seems to have been undistinguished ‚Äî he is recorded as fighting only two battles and seems to have lost both - and it was under his rule that Barcelona was sacked in 985 by the Muslim leader Almanzor.Catalunya Carol√≠ngia V: els comtats de Girona, Besal√∫, Emp√∫ries i Peralada.

Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores 38. Hannover: Hahn 2000. Borrell was also a patron of learning and culture. In 967, Borrell visited the monastery of Aurillac and the Abbot asked the count to take Gerbert of Aurillac (the future Pope Sylvester II) with him so that the boy could study mathematics in Spain. In the following years, Gerbert studied under the direction of Bishop Atto of Vic, some 60 km north of Barcelona, and probably also at the nearby Monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll. He was also taken on the 970 embassy to Rome, during which the Pope persuaded Otto to employ Gerbert as a tutor for his young son, the future emperor Otto II. In 985 the Hispanic March was attacked by the Muslim general Almanzor, who managed to take Barcelona, which was pillaged and sacked. Many citizens were taken prisoner by the Muslim forces.Gaspar Feliu i Montfort, La presa de Barcelona per Almansor. Hist√≤ria i mitificaci√≥ . Barcelona: Institut d'Estudis Catalans 2007.

No answer to Hugh's letter is known from Borrell, and the connection between the March and France was effectively broken. Catalan historians now consider this the point at which Catalonia became a sovereign power, and the millennium of their independence was celebrated in 1987 with conferences and numerous publications; however it appears that Catalan counties other than Borrell's retained links with the Frankish crown for a little longer.J.

Interactions  Concomitant use of tizanidine and moderate or potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (such as zileuton, certain antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, aciclovir, ticlopidine and oral contraceptives) is contraindicated. Concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor in humans, resulted in a 33-fold increase in the tizanidine AUC (plasma drug concentration-time curve). For this reason both fluvoxamine and tizanidine should not be taken at the same time. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin should also be avoided due to an increased serum concentration of tizanidine when administered concomitantly. Tizanidine has the potential to interact with other central nervous system depressants. Alcohol should be avoided, particularly as it can upset the stomach. The CNS- depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. Caution with the following interactions: * antibiotics such as enoxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin , or norfloxacin; * blood pressure medications such as clonidine, guanabenz, guanfacine (Tenex), or methyldopa; * heart rhythm medications such as amiodarone (Cordarone, Pacerone), mexiletine (Mexitil), propafenone (Rhythmol), and verapamil (Calan, Covera, Isoptin).  Pharmacology  Tizanidine is an Œ±2 receptor agonist closely related to clonidine. It has approximately one tenth to one fifteenth of the pressure lowering effect of clonidine. The relation between the Œ±2 receptor agonism and the spasmolytic action is still not fully understood. =Route of administration= Tizanidine is available as a tablet or capsule. Capsules may be opened and sprinkled on food. However, this may change the absorption of the medication compared to taking the capsule whole. =Chemistry= It has a volume of distribution of 2.4 L/kg following intravenous administration.

Definition If X_i are k independent, normally distributed random variables with means mu_i and variances sigma_i^2, then the statistic :Z = sqrt{sum_{i=1}^k left(frac{X_i}{sigma_i}right)^2} is distributed according to the noncentral chi distribution. The noncentral chi distribution has two parameters: k which specifies the number of degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of X_i), and lambda which is related to the mean of the random variables X_i by: :lambda=sqrt{sum_{i=1}^k left(frac{mu_i}{sigma_i}right)^2} Properties =Probability density function= The probability density function (pdf) is :f(x;k,lambda)=frac{e^{-(x^2+lambda^2)/2}x^klambda} {(lambda x)^{k/2}} I_{k/2-1}(lambda x) where I_ u(z) is a modified Bessel function of the first kind. =Raw moments= The first few raw moments are: :mu^'_1=sqrt{frac{pi}{2}}L_{1/2}^{(k/2-1)}left(frac{-lambda^2}{2}right) :mu^'_2=k+lambda^2 :mu^'_3=3sqrt{frac{pi}{2}}L_{3/2}^{(k/2-1)}left(frac{-lambda^2}{2}right) :mu^'_4=(k+lambda^2)^2+2(k+2lambda^2) where L_n^{(a)}(z) is a Laguerre function. Note that the 2nth moment is the same as the nth moment of the noncentral chi-squared distribution with lambda being replaced by lambda^2. Bivariate non-central chi distribution Let X_j = (X_{1j}, X_{2j}), j = 1, 2, dots n, be a set of n independent and identically distributed bivariate normal random vectors with marginal distributions N(mu_i,sigma_i^2), i=1,2, correlation rho, and mean vector and covariance matrix : E(X_j)= mu=(mu_1, mu_2)^T, qquad Sigma = begin{bmatrix} sigma_{11} & sigma_{12}  sigma_{21} & sigma_{22} end{bmatrix} = begin{bmatrix} sigma_1^2 & rho sigma_1 sigma_2  rho sigma_1 sigma_2 & sigma_2^2 end{bmatrix}, with Sigma positive definite. Define : U = left[ sum_{j=1}^n frac{X_{1j}^2}{sigma_1^2} right]^{1/2}, qquad V = left[ sum_{j=1}^n frac{X_{2j}^2}{sigma_2^2} right]^{1/2}. Then the joint distribution of U, V is central or noncentral bivariate chi distribution with n degrees of freedom. If either or both mu_1 eq 0 or mu_2 eq 0 the distribution is a noncentral bivariate chi distribution. Related distributions *If X is a random variable with the non-central chi distribution, the random variable X^2 will have the noncentral chi-squared distribution. Other related distributions may be seen there. *If X is chi distributed: X sim chi_k then X is also non- central chi distributed: X sim NCchi_k(0). In other words, the chi distribution is a special case of the non-central chi distribution (i.e., with a non-centrality parameter of zero). *A noncentral chi distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is equivalent to a Rice distribution with sigma=1. *If X follows a noncentral chi distribution with 1 degree of freedom and noncentrality parameter Œª, then œÉX follows a folded normal distribution whose parameters are equal to œÉŒª and œÉ2 for any value of œÉ.

(Vol. 1), (Vol. 2). He soon entered politics and even received a medal from Sattar Khan for his efforts. Initially, he went to clerical school, but then went to Bulgaria and wrote many poems on Islam. He then came back to Iran, and enlisted in the armed forces, and graduated as Captain in rank. After being convicted by a court in Qom to death, he fled to Turkey, but soon returned and joined forces with Sheikh Mohammad Khiabani in Tabriz. His forces defeated Mahmud Khan Puladeen's troops, but were soon disbanded by freshly dispatched forces. He fled to Baku. While living in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, he became interested in Communism. After marrying a Russian poet by the name Cecilia Banu (Sisil Banu), being unable to initiate a coup d'etat against the central government of Iran, he gave up and moved to USSR where he remained until his final days. In 1925, he went to Dushanbe and joined the friends of Sadriddin Aini. His poetry was welcomed by audiences and gained him the position of the founder of Soviet Tajik poetry.Iraj Bashiri, Prominent Tajik figures of the twentieth century, Dushanbe, 2002 Lahuti is the author of the Tajik SSR anthem.

From 1301 the town in the centre of the Spreewald floodplain was in the possession of the monks of Dobrilugk Abbey, who sold it to Duke Rudolph I of Saxe-Wittenberg in 1329. After several conflicts with the Wittelsbach margraves of Brandenburg the March of Lusatia was finally acquired by Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg in 1367 who incorporated L√ºbben into the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the 15th century L√ºbben became the seat of the Bohemian Vogt administrator and the provincial diet (Landtag) of Lower Lusatia. In 1526 the House of Habsburg inherited the Bohemian kingdom including Lusatia, which in 1623 Ferdinand II of Habsburg had to give in pawn to Elector John George I of Saxony. The Saxon Electorate finally acquired L√ºbben by signing the 1635 Peace of Prague. After the Napoleonic Wars it again fell to the Prussian province of Brandenburg by the final act of the 1815 Congress of Vienna. During World War II, L√ºbben was taken by Soviet troops of the 3rd Guards Army on 27 April 1945.

It was introduced by the newly elected Labour government of Tony Blair. The other Act was the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997. Background The act was created in response to the Snowdrop Petition following the Dunblane Massacre. The previous Conservative government had followed the recommendations of the Cullen Report on the massacre and introduced the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 that banned \\"high calibre\\" handguns, greater than .22 calibre (5.6 mm). This new (No. 2) act further banned the private possession of all cartridge ammunition handguns, regardless of calibre. The only handguns still allowed following the ban were: * Antique and muzzle-loading black-powder guns * Guns of historic interest whose ammunition is no longer available (\\"Section 7.1\\" weapons) * Guns of historic interest with current calibres (\\"Section 7.3\\" weapons) * Air pistols * Guns which fall outside the Home Office definition of \\"handguns\\". * Pistols used by hunters for humane dispatch * The Act does not extend to Northern Ireland, where firearms regulations differ due to the Troubles. Northern Ireland law allows pistols for use as personal protection weapons, mainly by retired police or prison officers, but also prominent figures who were considered at risk. Gun Crime After the Ban The number of recorded firearms offences in the United Kingdom increased after the law entered force.

The ASK 21 is designed primarily for beginner instruction, but is also suitable for cross-country flying and aerobatic instruction. Design and development The ASK 21 was designed by Rudolf Kaiser to replace the popular ASK 13, providing a modern two-seat aircraft bridging the gap between initial training and single-seat performance flying. The ASK 21 is the first full-GRP two-seater produced by Schleicher, flying for the first time in February 1979 (6.2.1979). Production also began in 1979, remaining in production to this day (May 2018), over 900 units completed. In December 2004 the ASK 21 Mi, a self-launching version, made its first flight. In 2003 the operating time was extended to 18,000 hoursTechnical note No. 29, Extension of service life beyond 12000 operation hours. A revised and improved version, the ASK 21B was introduced in 2018.https://www.alexander-schleicher.de/en/neu-b- version-der-ask-21 =Construction= The two seats are in a tandem arrangement with dual controls, adjustable rudder pedals and seatbacks. The fuselage consists of a tubular sandwich and thus offers passive safety with low weight. The two-piece, mid-set, cantilever wing is a single-spar glass- fiber construction without flaps, but with upper side Schempp-Hirth-type air brakes. The wingtips curve downward, providing tip skids that allow take-offs without a wing helper (small wheel added with ASK-21 mi). The T-tail possesses a fixed horizontal stabilizer and an elevator with spring trim and automatic connections. The undercarriage consists of two or three fixed wheels. The main wheel lies behind the centre of gravity and has a hydraulically operated disc brake. Checking the tire pressure is hindered by the need for removing the wheel fairing. The tail unit has a rubber skid or a tailwheel. Flight characteristics The thick wing profile gives good low-speed characteristics (nominal stall speed approximately 65 km/h or 35 knots). The flight characteristics are docile; its stall is gentle, with ample vibration warning, and is easily recoverable. The nose does not noticeably drop, but the variometer indicates a high rate of descent and the vibration continues until back pressure is released and stall recovery is initiated. Spin kit installation on the tail of C-FASK at the Bromont Airport in Quebec The glider has little tendency to enter a spin. In order to make spinning possible for training purposes or demonstrations a spin kit is available from the manufacturer. It consists of ballast discs applied to the tail to change the center of gravity according to the weight of the crew. With this device the ASK 21 when slowed to stall speed with rudder input drops one wing and begins to rotate. Recovery is standard, utilizing neutralized ailerons, full opposite rudder until the rotation stops and then centralizing the rudder, relaxing back pressure to break the stall, and then easing the stick back to pull out of the dive. When entering a side slip, which is not uncommon as an energy management technique, the rudder can aerodynamically over centre, requiring an input from the pilot for the rudder pedals to return to neutral.

In 1978, the station increased its signal power to cover the far western portion of Charlotte and expanded its coverage as WXIK, adopting a top 40 format as \\"K-96\\" that was heavy on \\"deep cut\\" rock hits. Air staff at WXIK included longtime PD/MD Jeffrey Owens, longtime Shelby personality Andy Foster, Vince Goolio, J. Worthington Smith, Eddie Bridges, Dawne Conrad, Don Richards, Rusty Price, Kent Dorsey, Scott Miller, Jeff Champion, and Bob Davis. On February 27, 1987, at 5:30 a.m., the station boosted its signal again to cover the entire Charlotte area. At the same time, the station adopted a gold-based adult contemporary format. A new set of call letters, WWMG, were adopted at that time as well, along with the name \\"Magic 96\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-03-13.pdf By early 1989, the station flipped to oldies.

Despite the controversy that ensued, WIBT became a success story when it went to #1 in the Fall 2004 Arbitron ratings. As a Rhythmic Top 40 formatted station, WIBT was in competition with long-time Urban heritage station WPEG and Pop station WNKS. Although its music tended to favor hip hop, WIBT played pop and dance crossovers that were hits.

Overview Domdaniel was first mentioned in the continued story of the Arabian Nights by Dom Chaves and Cazotte (1788-1793). It was described as being located in the sea near Tunis. In this hall, the ruler Zatanai held his court, which included the magician Maugraby and his students. Robert Southey later used Domdaniel in his multi- volume oriental poem Thalaba the Destroyer (1797). The hero of Southey's story, Thalaba, is the son of Hodeirah and the last surviving member of his family. It had been prophesied that the spirits of the Domdaniel were destined to be destroyed by a member of that family, so they sought to put an end to it. One of the magicians named by Southey as dwelling in Domdaniel was Abdaldar. He was selected by lot to hunt down Thalaba and slay him. But the youth Thalaba accomplishes the destruction of the magicians in the final volume of the poem despite their efforts to kill him and his surviving family. Nathaniel Hawthorne used Domdaniel in his romance The House of the Seven Gables: \\"Hepzibah put her hand into her pocket, and presented the urchin, her earliest and staunchest customer, with silver enough to people the Domdaniel cavern of his interior with as various a procession of quadrupeds as passed into the ark.\\" In T.H White's book The Sword in the Stone Merlin, before his famous duel of magic with the witch Madam Mim, says \\"Now we shall see how a double first at Dom-Daniel avails against the private tuition of my master Bleise\\". H. P. Lovecraft used Domdaniel in the short story He (1925), as follows: ...heard as with the mind's ear the blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony ... British author Angie Sage used the name DomDaniel (styled this way) to name the main foe of her fantasy novel series Septimus Heap. Domdaniel is the headquarters of the Spanish Inquisition in Neil Gaiman's graphic novel Marvel 1602 and includes large caverns. Domdaniel secretly served as the headquarters of Grand Inquisitor Enrique and The Brotherhood of those Who Will Inherit the Earth.

Tolkien's The Hobbit, written by A.R.R.R. Roberts. The book jacket states: \\"Following on (inevitably, some might say) from the frankly unlikely success of Bored of the Rings comes a new book from an entirely different author that Tolkien's other (and undoubtedly shorter) masterpiece.\\" The book consists of primarily slapstick-style jokes, with characters of slightly different names from the original ones (for example, Bingo as opposed to Bilbo) and a slightly altered main storyline. As the book progresses, the story departs further and further from the original storyline that it parodies. It is also illustrated in 'Glorius Mono-colour' (again stated on the book jacket) by Douglas Carrel. Plot summary The story starts with a peaceful Soddit called Bingo who is visited by a wizard, Gandef, and a party of dwarfs led by Thorri and Mori who ask Bingo to come with them on a quest to 'The Only Mountain' where 'Smug the Dragon' lives. After a few drinks, Bingo accepts, not knowing what they were actually searching for. \\"Gold, boyo gold, la, look you.\\" On the way, they have many adventures and close shaves, including their ponies drowning in the river and losing all luggage but one helmet. Roberts says he wanted the company fighting through the Piccadilly flea circus and fighting the Daleks from Doctor Who, but he says it was cut for time. They have a nasty run in with some trollops, who plan to eat them, successfully squash four dwarfs but they annoy the wizard Gandef, who temporarily turns them to mounds of sand as opposed to real stone. While at the tree village of Riverdale, Ellesquare and the other Tree Elves of the high council ridicule the dwarfs for their loss of their four comrades and call it \\"carelessness.\\" The company entered the mountains after Gandef struggled to open the door until he coughed, which was apparently the password. In the mountains, they encounter Gobblins, which are evil turkeys, who take them to their town, but the dwarves all fight out, Gandef repeatedly decapitates countless Gobblins while in combat, a fifth dwarf dies in friendly fire from Gandef and Bingo gets lost by falling down the abyss. He falls into a cavern where he meets a morose philosopher named Sollum. He challenges him to a game of riddles; with the cannibalistic philosopher seeing Bingo's presence as the only delightful moment in his life. Bingo wins the riddles, and asks what he wins, but then remembers he found a Thing¬Æ that was created by evil dark lord Sharon and is Sollum's. So the philosopher tries to eat him but he escapes due to the Thing¬Æ's super-speed. After reuniting with the party, the dwarfs are chased by non-sentient wolves, hide in a tree until the pack gives up, where a sixth Dwarf dies. Following the minimal casualties from the wolves, the company simply climb down the tree and walk away. Gandef plans to take them to a mill, which is \\"famous\\" but it has been burned when they get there. Then they go to see a fearsome maniac, Biorn the bear-man, who is reputed to change from man to bear at night, but later during the visit they find he is just a totally crazy, naked man who thinks he can transform. They shut him outside his house to calm him down and then they move on leaving him to mumble. The next bit is the \\"enchanted\\" forest of Myurkywood, which has been under an illusion spell for some time. As in the original, the streams are magic, and turn to rapids quick. They meet highly bitter, political spiders in the forest who want to lay eggs in their beards, but Bingo realizes the Thing¬Æ can get them out of their peril, which it does. It works by reversed spells but a seventh Dwarf dies from using it to heal his ankles. Then, they find a brewery, where the men are morbidly obese Dwarfs and drunk and want to drown them because they can't sing. After unintentionally using the Thing¬Æ to obtain drunken immunity, Bingo gets them out. They get to Lakeside, where they go off to the Only Mountain, where Bingo asks if the dwarves are going to finally tell him why he's there. Upon hearing that he has to go down a chimney, Bingo is accidentally thrown down said chimney when Mori promises to tell him the truth, and meets the dragon Smug, who is actually very friendly and even offers him tea. Smug says he hasn't made any enemies and doesn't know of anyone who would kill him. He is worried he has driven away the Lakesiders' business so he says he'll fly over to talk. But the dwarves are angry and tell Bingo that Gandef was a dwarf, he has changed into a wizard, and he'll now change into a dragon because that's nature and that's where dragons come from. Smug is shot dead at Lakeside by Lard the Bowman, and twenty thousand gobblins led by the Great Gobblin attack, but the six remaining dwarves led by Mori, five hundred men led by Lard, five hundred elves led by Ellesquare, and Bingo, led by himself, fight them. At the end, most of the men and elves are massacred, three more Dwarfs die, Mori is severely injured and the gobblins swarm round them demanding the Thing¬Æ, but Bingo tricks them by giving them the Barking Stone, which they believe is the Thing¬Æ and whispers in it \\"war\\", which causes Gandef's dragon breath to erupt from the Only Mountain's chimney and kill all the gobblins, which encircles the remaining soldiers of the other four armies. After the Battle of the Five Armies has ended, Mori dies in Bingo's arms, which finishes off in a style of a Looney Tunes ending and thus only two Dwarfs of the company have survived the quest. Gandef is confirmed and revealed to be a dragon, who can't remember that he wiped out the gobblin army and saved the survivors single-handedly, before flying Bingo home.

The product contains three CDs, runs for 4 hours, and is read by Mark Perry. . Parodies In 'The Soddit' there is a small message claiming that it is not \\"The first few minutes of a prologue of \\"A MAJOR NINE-HOUR EPIC!!!\\". Also, at the end, it has various fake books being advertised, including 'The Spuddit' which is a parody of 'The Soddit' where the parts are taken by potatoes. However, this is a joke and there is no such book (as yet). Reception Steven H. Silver delivered a favourable review of the book in 2004. He observed that Roberts used Tolkien's own \\"excesses which readily give themselves to parody\\". According to Silver, The Soddit had not simply become a joke but is a full novel with deep characters and new parts in the plot.

In 1832, he entered the university of Edinburgh, where, after studying in Berlin and St. Petersburg, he graduated as MD in 1839. About 1840, he was engaged in experiments by which he sought to prove that carbon in certain states of combination is susceptible of conversion into silicon, and his failure to establish this proposition had much to do with his want of success as a candidate for the chair of chemistry at Edinburgh in 1843. He held the doctrine that the chemical elements are compounds of equal and similar atoms, and might therefore possibly be all derived from one generic atom. In 1850 he published a tragedy, Galileo Galilei, and two volumes of his Lectures on the Atomic Theory and Essays Scientific and Literary appeared in 1858, with a preface by his kinsman Dr. John Brown, the author of Horae Subsecivae.

It has become a popular hashtag on Sina Weibo with more than 8 million mentions by the start of March 2015.  History  The word was coined in a notoriously bad 2004 advertisement for Bawang Shampoo in which Jackie Chan says, \\"...after filming, visual effects are added, the hair becomes (in Chinese, , misheard as \\"duang\\") very black, very shiny and very smooth.\\" The advertisement was the subject of a parody published on 20 February 2015 on the Chinese video sharing site Bilibili, featuring footage of Chan remixed to the tune of the viral Chinese song My Skate Shoes (ÊàëÁöÑÊªëÊùøÈûã). In the video, Chan appears to say that he has no hair at all, with more interjections of \\"duang\\": \\"after a month of special effects, hair is ‚Äì dua-a-a-ng ‚Äì still I knew they're fake, that it's due to chemicals. Every day now, I'm adding special effects... added a lot of effects... hair ‚Äì duang duang duang ‚Äì is thick and shiny.\\" The parody alludes to a 2010 scandal in which Bawang was accused of having added carcinogenic chemicals to its hair products. Jackie Chan acknowledged the parody by uploading a self-mocking microblog that imitated the sentence structure from the spoof advertisement. He also expressed his gratitude for the public's attention and his determination to create more movies for his fans in the future. His optimistic personality and self-mockery won over many fans. Meaning Despite its widespread appearance, the meaning of duang is unclear; \\"What's the meaning of duang\\" became the main topic on Weibo. Although there seems to be no meaning at all, many people still continue to use it in their everyday conversations. The BBC has suggested that the word is an example of onomatopoeia, a word phonetically imitating a sound. While Chan used it as a \\"cartoonish sound- effect\\", as Ad Age puts it, some have used it in the same spirit while others have adopted it as an intensifier; for instance, something might be \\"duang cute\\" or you might be \\"very duang confused\\". Based on the words spoken by Chan in the shampoo advertisement, duang has been defined as meaning \\"add special effects\\" () in some Chinese sources. The meme has been picked up by a variety of advertisers, including Bawang itself, which has released its own spoof video, in addition to KFC, PepsiCo, China Eastern Airlines and Taobao. Durex issued an animated GIF showing a buzzing rabbit vibrator with \\"duang\\" as the caption. The meme's lack of any defined meaning has enabled advertisers and Internet users to create their own version of \\"duang\\" and define it as they wish. Foreign Policy noted that while Chinese Internet users had a tradition of inventing new words or slang to get around government censorship, the Chinese government had lately managed to push back against this practice; it was thus perhaps \\"inevitable that a new word would emerge that simply meant nothing at all.\\" Pronunciation The word duang is not a permissible syllable in Standard Chinese. However, as both the onset d- and the rime -uang are both legal segments that occur in other syllables, the word is pronounceable in Mandarin. Although the word was initially written without any indication of tone, it was later given a first tone reading as duƒÅng.  Chinese character  A character for duang does not exist in any Chinese dictionary and is not encoded in Unicode, but was created from the two characters used for Jackie Chan's Chinese stage name, Cheng Long (, meaning \\"become a dragon\\"), stacked on top of each other.  In music  The string quartet 'Duang' by composer Samuel Cho premiered in May 2018 is inspired by this word. References External links * Discussion of duang by Victor H.

Early life On May 2, 1874, Cady was born in Skiddy, Kansas. He is the son of Perkins Elijah Cady and Ella Falkenbury.  Education  After attending Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, he enrolled at the University of Kansas, where he graduated in 1897 with an A.B., and in 1903 with a Ph.D. During his senior year he carried out the initial experiments on the electrical conductance of solutions of salts in liquid ammonia, opening up a new and fruitful field of research. This constituted the first step in the development of the ammonia system of compounds, a concept which, owing to the later contributions of Edward C. Franklin and Charles A. Kraus, became an outstanding feature of American chemical achievement. Following the completion of his undergraduate work he was granted a scholarship and then a fellowship at Cornell University where he spent the years 1897‚Äì1899 in research under the direction of Wilder D. Bancroft.  Career  In 1899, Cady returned to the University of Kansas as assistant professor of chemistry and resumed his work with liquid ammonia in collaboration with Franklin, carrying out a thesis consisting of a study of concentration cells in this solvent. When Franklin was called to Stanford University in 1903 Cady took over his courses in inorganic and physical chemistry at Kansas as associate professor. In 1911 he was advanced to professor and in 1920 was made chairman of the department, continuing until 1942 when he retired with the title of professor emeritus. His most notable work was in the discovery and development of the first industrial source of helium gas. In 1903 he was called on to analyze a natural gas from Dexter, Kansas, which would not burn unless continuously heated. In collaboration with David McFarland he discovered that the gas contained nearly 12% of helium. No helium in natural gas had been discovered prior to that time, although it had been found in 1894 that helium existed on the earth, and might be extracted in small quantities from the atmosphere and from minerals. Cady was a consultant when helium reserves were later found in Texas and Colorado. In 1917 he was appointed consulting chemist to the U.S. Bureau of Mines upon the inauguration by the Bureau of experiments with regard to helium and during the World War I he did a large amount of analytical and research work, the results of which influenced the designs of the various helium plants which were constructed by the government. He also made valuable research into the limits of the inflammability of helium and hydrogen mixtures and carried out a number of experiments on the permeability of balloon fabric by helium. In 1933 he developed a process for using chimney gases in the manufacture of a refrigerant. In 1936 he developed an ingenious new method for the accurate measurement of gaseous densities by means of a modified Westphal balance. The invention made it possible for the determination of molecular weight of gases with a degree of speed and precision not approached by any other method. Despite his achievements in research, teaching constituted Cady's real life work. His courses won nationwide repute, and many of his former students attained eminence in scientific fields. He was co-author with Edgar Henry Summerfield Bailey of A Laboratory Guide to the Study of Qualitative Analysis (1901) and author of The Principles of Inorganic Chemistry (1912), and General Chemistry (1916). He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Chemical Society.  Personal  On June 5, 1900, Cady married Stella Cornelia Gallup, daughter of George Gallup. They had three children: Ruth Caroline, George Hamilton, and Helen Frances. On May 26, 1943, Cady died in Lawrence, Kansas. Cady was 69. References *The National Cyclop√¶dia of American Biography, Volume 39. New York: James T.

As the Patriot, he first appeared in Human Torch Comics #4 (Spring 1941; misnumbered #3 on cover), published by Marvel's 1940s precursor, Timely Comics. In 1976, Marvel revealed via retroactive continuity that Mace had become the third Captain America some time after his World War II era adventures. He is also the uncle-by-marriage of Thunderbolt Ross. The character has been adapted into the Marvel Cinematic Universe on the TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the fourth season, played by Jason O'Mara.

The character went on to appear in the first of two Human Torch issues both inadvertently numbered #5, and known to collectors as #5[a] (Summer 1941),The Human Torch #5[a] at the Grand Comics Database. in a story by Gill and artist Sid Greene. Concurrently, the Patriot began as regular feature in the superhero anthology Marvel Mystery Comics, appearing in issues #21‚Äì44 (July 1941 ‚Äì June 1943) and #49 -74 (Nov. 1943 ‚Äì July 1946), making him one of Timely's most popular characters in the second tier beneath stars Captain America, the Human Torch, and the Sub-Mariner. The Patriot story \\"Death Stalks the Shipyard\\", from Marvel Mystery Comics #29, was reprinted during the Silver Age of Comic Books in Marvel Super-Heroes #16 (Sept. 1968). In The Avengers #97 (March 1972), a simulacrum of the Patriot was temporarily created from the mind of Rick Jones, along with those of the Blazing Skull, the Fin, and the Golden Age Angel and Vision, to aid the superhero team the Avengers during the Kree-Skrull War.The Avengers #97 (March 1972) at the Grand Comics Database.

That team later appeared alongside Fantastic Four member the Thing in a two-part time travel story, set during World War II, in Marvel Two-in-One #20 (Oct. 1976) and Marvel Two-in-One Annual (1976). When Marvel Comics had revived the character Captain America in 1964, the story explained that he had been missing in action and in suspended animation since 1945. This discrepancy with his postwar comic-book appearances was later explained as the result of replacement heroes taking on the mantle. As the third Captain America, Jeffrey Mace would have been behind the mask in Captain America Comics #59‚Äì75 (Nov. 1946 ‚Äì Feb. 1950) and other comics during that period. Mace succeeded the second Captain America, William Naslund (formerly the Spirit of '76), who was shown in What If? vol. 1, #4 (Aug. 1977) as having been killed in 1946. Mace appeared briefly in a flashback in Captain America #215 (Nov. 1977), then as a guest-star in Captain America Annual #6 (1982) with his death depicted in #285 (Sept. 1983). In a flashback, the Patriot co-starred in a World War II adventure with Captain America in Captain America Annual #13 (1994) and in a post-war adventure with the All Winners Squad in All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special (2009). A retelling of Jeffrey Mace's origin and time as Captain America is told in the 2010 mini- series Captain America: Patriot. This was collected with the All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special and What If? #4 in 2011. What If? #4 was also collected that same year in a Captain America Legacy volume collecting the debuts of the Captain America replacements. Fictional character biography Jeffrey Mace was born in Brooklyn, New York. He was a reporter at the Daily Bugle, who was inspired to become a superhero after seeing Captain America in action. As the Patriot, Mace becomes one of several superheroes who fight Nazi saboteurs and supervillains during World War II, sometimes alongside his sidekick Mary Morgan, a.k.a. Miss Patriot. He helps found the superhero team known as the Liberty Legion, billed as \\"America's home front heroes\\" who fight saboteurs, fifth columnists and other wartime threats within the United States. After the war, the Patriot continues to fight crime on a regular basis, eventually helping the All-Winners Squad prevent the assassination of a young Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1946. The skirmish costs the life of the second Captain America, William Naslund formerly the Spirit of '76. Mace is recruited to be the third Captain America,Captain America: Patriot #1 (Nov. 2010) at the Grand Comics Database. retiring in 1949. He marries Betsy Ross who, as the superhero Golden Girl, had briefly been the post-war sidekick of his Captain America, and eventually succumbs to cancer at an old age.Captain America #285 Powers and abilities Jeffrey Mace had no superpowers but he was an exceptional athlete, a superb hand-to-hand combatant and a licensed pilot. As Captain America, he carried a shield, similar to that used by his predecessors, that was made of enhanced titanium. Reception In American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944, Kurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas call the Patriot \\"a bargain-basement Captain America with an uncanny knack for stumbling into Axis conspiracies. Though Arthur \\"Art\\" Gates and Sidney \\"Sid\\" Greene did their best to replicate Jack Kirby's frenetic fight scenes, the feature had none of the charisma of its inspiration.\\" In other media =Television= * Jeffrey Mace appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., portrayed by Jason O'Mara. Debuting in the episode \\"Meet the New Boss\\", he is introduced as the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.. This incarnation is an ex-journalist who survived Helmut Zemo's attack on the United Nations during the events of Captain America: Civil War. Although believed to be an Inhuman with super-strength and enhanced durability, Mace is actually empowered by a serum derived from Calvin Zabo's formula minus the physically deforming and emotionally unstable side effects as part of \\"Project Patriot\\". However, the formula is still flawed and creates a risk of death each time he uses it as it puts significant strain on Mace's physiology. While living in the alternate reality known as 'the Framework', Mace's personal history is rewritten to 'correct' his most potent regret; as a result, his personal history is altered. In this reality, Mace is an Inhuman who underwent a successful terrigenesis, granting him the actual powers of super-strength and enhanced durability that he counterfeited in the real world. Mace joined and then later took command of the remnant S.H.I.E.L.D. forces after the Hydra purge and successfully led the resistance, including recruiting two high-profile Hydra agents as allies (Grant Ward and Daisy Johnson) and planting a trusted agent as a spy (Antoine 'Trip' Triplett). In the episode, \\"No Regrets\\", Mace sacrifices himself inside the virtual world of the Framework to save Phil Coulson's team and Inhumans from a HYDRA attack, which also caused the death of his real world body. His sacrifice persuaded Agent May to rejoin S.H.I.E.L.D and set in motion a chain of events allowing her to free Daisy from Hydra captivity and pull Leo Fitz from the framework, saving all three. * Jason O'Mara reprises his role of Jeffrey Mace in a six- part digital series titled Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot.

Burliuk is often described as \\"the father of Russian Futurism.\\" Biography =Early life= David Burliuk was born in 1882 in Semyrotivka near the village of Riabushky (now Lebedyn District, Sumy Oblast) in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine), brother of fellow artist Volodymyr Burliuk in a family partly descended from Ukrainian Cossacks who held premier positions in the Hetmanate. His mother, Ludmyla Mikhnevich, was of ethnic Belarusian descent.Pg. 77, Nabokov and his fiction: new perspectives By Julian W. Connolly =Education, career= Burliuk (2nd from right) Burliuk in the 1910s From 1898 to 1904 he studied at Kazan and Odessa art schools, as well as at the Royal Academy in Munich. His exuberant, extroverted character was recognized by Anton Azhbe, his professor at the Munich Academy, who called Burliuk a ‚Äúwonderful wild steppe horse.‚Äù'About David Burliuk' ‚Äî biography from the Futurism and After: David Burliuk, 1882‚Äì1967 exhibition In 1907, he made contact with the Russian art world; he met and befriended Mikhail Larionov, and they are both credited as being major forces in bringing together the contemporary art world. In 1908 an exhibition with the group Zveno (\\"The Link\\") in Kiev was organized by David Burliuk together with Wladimir Baranoff-Rossine, Alexander Bogomazov, his brother Volodymyr (Wladimir) Burliuk and Aleksandra Ekster. The exhibition was a flop, especially because they were all unknown painters. The Burliuks and Larionov left for the aforementioned brothers' home in Chernianka, also known as Hylea; it was during this stay that their work became more Avant-Garde. That autumn, whilst visiting Ekster, they organized an exhibition which took place in the street; it was a success, and enough money was raised to go to Moscow. In 1909 Burliuk painted a portrait of his future wife, Marussia, on a background of flowers and rocks on the Crimean coast. Many times thereafter he would set the image of his wife to canvas. Without question two dreams possessed his heart all his life: the face of his wife and the portrait of his homeland - first Ukraine and then his adopted country, the United States. The Futurist literary group Hylaea ( [Gileya]) was initiated in 1910 by David Burlyuk and his brothers at their aforementioned estate near Kherson, and were quickly joined by Vasily Kamensky and Velimir Khlebnikov, with Aleksey Kruchenykh and Vladimir Mayakovsky joining in 1911Victor Terras, Handbook of Russian Literature (Yale University Press, 1990), s.v. \\"Hylaea\\", p. 197.). Soon afterwards the group would morph into literary Cubo-Futurism, the predominant form of Futurism in Russia. From the start to the end, Cubo-Futurism always had an air of scandal about it. The artists and poets scandalized the public by walking in public spaces wearing ridiculous clothes and painting their faces, by writing plays incomprehensible to the public (the most notorious being Victory over the Sun, about a group of Futurists aiming to destroy reason), and by the fights between them and the audience at their poetry recitations. In 1913-4, Mayakovsky, Kamensky, and Burliuk decided to go on poetry tours; fury almost always followed, even on an occasion when Mayakovsky read Pushkin. Alexander Rodchenko later claimed that that specific recital \\"was the first time I had seen such a frenzied, furious audience\\". Even during the First World War their activites carried on: at the 1915 Christmas Party, hosted by Lilya and Osip Brik, the tree was hung from the roof, upside-down, and the guests arrived with vegetables in their buttonholes and in bizarre makeup. Russian Futurism would only end after the Revolution of 1917. Most of the Cubo-Futurists also resisted the Futurists in Italy. A brief alliance with their rivals, the Ego-Futurists, did not end very well. Burliuk's colleague Velimir Khlebnikov also developed Zaum, a poetry style. From 1910 he was the member of the group Jack of Diamonds, and from 1910 to 1911 he attended the Art School in Odessa. After 1911 David concentrated on poetry and manifestoes, and at Christmas he made the acquaintance of Benedikt Livshits, a poet. From 1911 to 1913 he studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (MUZHVZ), and that year participated in the group exhibition of the Blaue Reiter in Munich, which also included his brother Wladimir. He also contributed an article to the Blaue Reiter Almanac. In December 1912 David Burliuk was co-author and one of the many signatories of the manifesto A Slap in the Face of Public Taste with the other members of Hylaea, one of the major manifestoes of Russian Futurism, a movement of Russian poets and artists who adopted the principles of Filippo Marinetti's \\"Futurist Manifesto\\". In 1913 he was expelled from the Art Academy, as well as Mayakovsky. In the same year D. Burliuk founded the publishing venture of the futurist writer's group Hylaea. In 1914 he and his brother Wladimir illustrated Kamensky's Tango with Cows, and in 1915 David Burliuk published the book The Support of the Muses in Spring, with illustrations by Aristarkh Lentulov, and by David and Wladimir Burliuk. David Burliuk Revolution, 1917 From 1915 to 1917 he resided in the Urals with frequent trips to Moscow and Petrograd (St. Petersburg).Stephanie Barron and Maurice Tuchman, The Avant-Garde in Russia, 1910-1939: New Perspectives. Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1980; pg. 128. In 1917 he participated in an exhibition with the group Jack of Diamonds in the artists' salon in Moscow, which included Aleksandra Ekster and Kazimir Malevich. In 1916 his brother Wladimir Burliuk was drafted into military service, and in 1917 was killed in World War I in Saloniki. The next year Burliuk began traveling to the United States, a process that took him through Siberia, Japan, and Canada which wasn't complete until 1922. In 1925 Burliuk was a co-founder of the Association of Revolutionary Masters of Ukraine (ARMU) with the members Alexander Bogomazov, Vasiliy Yermilov, Vadym Meller, Alexander Khvostenko-Khvostov, and Palmov Victor. In 1927 he participated in an exhibition of the Latest Artistic Trends in the Russian Museum in Leningrad (St. Petersburg), together with Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandr Shevchenko, and Vladimir Tatlin. Some time later he left the country. David Burliuk was author of autobiographical sketches My Ancestors, Forty Years: 1890‚Äì1930. =Later years= In the 1930s, Onya La Tour was an avid collector of modern art who acquired at least one hundred works by Burliuk.The 1940 catalog Onya La Tour presents a rotating exhibition of modern art is available at Indiana University (look for the blue item on Result Page 3), and includes a list of 100 works by David Burliuk: The catalog is also online here: In 1940, Burliuk petitioned the Soviet government for a request to visit his homeland. In exchange, he offered a sizeable collection of archival material pertaining to his contemporary and friend Vladimir Mayakovsky, which Burliuk offered to donate to the Mayakovsky Museum in addition to over 100 original paintings. Burliuk's requests were denied. He was allowed to visit the Soviet Union only in 1956 and 1965. In 1945 an exhibit was mounted at Irving Place Theater in New York City In 1962 he and his wife traveled to Australia where he held an exhibition at Moreton Galleries, Brisbane. It was his only Australian exhibition. During his stay there David Burliuk painted some sketches and works with Australian views. From 1937 to 1966 Burliuk and his wife, Marusia, published Color & Rhyme, a journal primarily concerned with charting Burliuk's activities. David Burliuk lived in Hampton Bays on Long Island for approximately 20 years until he died on Long Island, New York. His house and studio still remain. Legacy In Russian poetry, Burliuk is regarded as a trailblazer. In 1990, the Russian Academy of Futurist Poetry established the David Burliuk Prize (Otmetina) for experimental poetry awarded annually.David Burliuk Prize Homepage Trivia *Burliuk appears in Part III of the Vladimir Mayakovsky's landmark poem A Cloud in Trousers (A Cloud in Pants, 1915). *A painting (most likely fictional) by Burliuk appears in the novel Chapayev and Void by Viktor Pelevin.

The Mission involves a state-run company called Mercados de Alimentos, C.A. (MERCAL), which provides subsidised food and basic goods through a nationwide chain of stores. In 2010 Mercal was reported as having 16,600 outlets, \\"ranging from street-corner shops to huge warehouse stores,\\" in addition to 6000 soup kitchens. Mercal employs 85,000 workers.Business Week, 11 March 2010, A Food Fight for Hugo Chavez Mission Mercal stores and cooperatives are mostly located in impoverished areas and sell generic-branded foods at discounts as great as 50%. While the company is heavily funded by the government, the goal is to become self-sufficient by replacing food imports with products from local farmers, small businesses, and cooperatives (many of whom have received microcredits from Mercal). This endogenous development is central to Ch√°vez's stated goal of non-capitalistic development from the bottom up. Recently, customers say that there are a lack of products in Mercal stores and that items available at these stores change constantly. Some customers complained about rationing being enforced at Mercal stores due to the lack of products.  Origins  Shoppers waiting in line at a Mercal store. The antecedent operations to Mission Mercal began operations following the economic hardships following the strike/lockout of 2002. Up until that period, Venezuela's food production and distribution systems were primarily managed by large national corporations, a situation homologous to the present reality in Western nations such as the United States or Europe. As most corporations supported the strike/lockout, which was aimed at politically damaging Ch√°vez, most of the food-related corporations joined the protests and ceased their operations. On 25 April 2003 broadcast of the television show Al√≥ Presidente, Ch√°vez expressed his outrage at Venezuela's lack of food sovereignty and the resultant vulnerability to the agenda of major food corporations, which was manifest in closed supermarkets, growing malnutrition, and food shortages. \\"This offensive served us a lot because we learned from the imperialism‚Äôs attack, from the Venezuelan oligarchy, and from those who were supporting the aggression against Venezuela and who would liked to have defeated us with hunger. [We learned] that we did not have a gram or a grain of anything, of food reserves. Before any natural, political or social disaster, Venezuela did not have then food reserves,\\" Ch√°vez stated. S√∫per Mercal store in Judibana, Venezuela. Afterwards, in the depths of the oil shutdowns and general turmoil of 2002, Mission Mercal's reach expanded rapidly. The Armed Forces were integral in providing logistical support in moving, procuring, warehousing, and distributing food. Military bases and supply depots were used as food supply nodes, while military barracks became storage centers. Ch√°vez acknowledged this by stating that \\"the army of Venezuela took to the street, gave of themselves and made the task easier with their technology, their human resources, their means of transportation and their installations for storing food\\". With initially only three Mercals (markets) and two warehouses, Mission Mercal (following its permanent and official inauguration in 2003) quickly multiplied to the point where 12,500 Mercalitos (mini-Mercals), 13,392 Mercals, hundreds of cooperatives, 31 Supermercals (mega markets), and 102 vast warehouses comprised a sprawling distribution system serving millions of barrio dwellers. In 2006 some 11.36 million Venezuelans benefited from Mercal food programs on a regular basis. At least 14,208 Mission Mercal food distribution sites were spread throughout Venezuela, and 4,543 metric tons of food distributed each day.  Food and discounts offered  Victuals offered by Mission Mercal include everything from meat and dairy (including powdered milk and cheese), to fresh produce, preserved foodstuffs, grains and cereals, fruits, vegetable oils, and mineral salts. These goods are offered in Mercal- affiliated establishments at discounts averaging between 25% to 50%. Shortages It has been reported that there are shortages in Mercal stores. Customers who wait in long lines for discounted products say that there were a lack of products in Mercal stores and that items available at the stores change constantly. Some customers complained about rationing being enforced at Mercal stores due to the lack of products. In some cases, protests have occurred due to the shortages in stores.

The village became a part of Letohrad in 1950. =Orlice village= The place was first mentioned in a written document from 1361 (a small fortress existed here) under its original name Pratum (in Latin). Since 1406 it has been called Orlice. The village has an old church building which was burned down during the Hussite Wars and for the last time was rebuilt in 1711. Since the end of the 19th century, several textile factories have been built here. Letohrad today The main source of employment after World War II have been electrotechnical industry and production of construction materials, as well as agriculture. Panel√°ks were built to provide housing. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989 the historical centre of the town was renovated.

Canady which prohibited intact dilation and extraction, sometimes referred to as partial- birth abortion, which the Act described as \\"an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery\\". The term \\"partial-birth abortion,\\" coined by the Canady has never been recognized by the American Medical Association or the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Doctors convicted under the bill would receive a fine and up to a two-year prison sentence. The bill was passed by both houses of Congress, but then vetoed by US President Bill Clinton. The debate over the bill was rife with misleading information from both sides. Opponents of the bill argued that D & X procedures only occurred in the case of severe fetal defects or when carrying the birth to term endangered the life of the mother; its advocates argued that the majority for purely elective reasons. These competing arguments both had some basis in truth but came from different classifications of D & X procedures; anti-Ban activists based their numbers solely on post-viability abortions, ignoring that pre-viability abortions account for more than 90 percent of D & X procedures. The use of the term \\"elective\\" by pro-Ban activists, on the other hand, completely overlooked the contextual factors such as youth, trauma, and poverty, that push women to choose D & X. The House overrode President Clinton's 1996 veto, but the Senate was several votes short of the required 2/3rds requirement with a margin of 58 yeas to 40 nays. The Republican-controlled Congress tried to push a similar ban in January 1997 with House Resolution 1122, but again its efforts were defeated by President Clinton's veto. A similar bill was later passed in 2003 as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush. See also *Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 *Gonzales v.

He was coinventor of the modern gravimeter, invented the zero-length spring, and vehicle-mounted gravimeters. He was also co-founder of a prominent company selling gravimetric instruments. Simplified LaCoste suspension using a zero- length spring LaCoste discovered the zero-length spring in 1932 while performing an assignment in Arnold Romberg's undergraduate physics course. A zero-length spring is a spring supported in such a way that its exerted force is proportional to its length, rather than the distance it is compressed. That is, over at least part of its travel, it does not conform to Hooke's Law of spring compression. The zero-length spring is extremely important to seismometers and gravimeters because it permits the design of vertical pendulums with (theoretically) infinite periods. In practice, periods of a thousand seconds are possible, a hundredfold increase from other forms of pendulum. Over a short period starting in 1932, the design of these instruments was revolutionized, obsoleting all previous designs. During this period, LaCoste and his physics teacher Arnold Romberg invented the first modern seismographs and gravimeters, using steel and quartz (respectively) zero-length springs. While a graduate student, LaCoste decided to go into business together with Romberg, selling advanced gravimeters to oil- exploration companies. LaCoste's most famous invention is the ship, and aircraft-mounted gravimeter. These revolutionized exploration for minerals by allowing wide-ranging geological surveys. The chief problem that Lacoste defeated was to distinguish the accelerations of the vehicles from the accelerations due to gravity, and measure the minute changes in gravity. Since the accelerations from the vehicle typically are hundreds to thousands of times more forceful than the measured changes, this invention was considered impossible until LaCoste demonstrated it.

The second situation is when the vehicle's wheels are stuck in some type of natural adhesive (mud, sand, snow, etc.) and the helpless female sees the only solution is to aggressively hold the gas pedal down in order to force the vehicle free. Both situations show a kind of urgency or dependency, which arouses the viewer. The viewers are predominantly male and heterosexual, even more so than for the general fetish and porn bias. It has been described as a 'clean, monotonous niche' and also identified with Republican, working-class or redneck men.

Gudiashvili was born into a family of a railroad employee. He studied in the Tbilisi school of sculpture and fine art (1910‚Äì1914), where he met the Armenian artist Alexander Bazhbeuk-Melikyan, and later in Ronson's private academy in Paris (1919‚Äì1926). For a while, Gudiashvili belonged to a group of Georgian poets called \\"The Blue Horns\\" (1914‚Äì1918), who were trying to connect organically the Georgian national flavour with the creative structure of French symbolism. In Paris, he was a constant customer of the famous \\"La Ruche,\\" a colony of painters where he met I. Zuloaga, Amedeo Modigliani, Natalia Goncharova, and Mikhail Larionov. Gudiashvili's work was greatly influenced by Niko Pirosmanashvili. Filled with the charm of Georgian life, the painter's early works combine dramatic grotesque with the charm of poetic mystery (Live Fish, 1920, Art Museum of Georgia). Closeness to the traditions of old Caucasian and Persian art was amplified upon his return to Georgia in 1926. Gudiashvili's colours become warmer, and the perception of the world as a theater grew stronger (many of Gudiashvili's paintings were either inspired by operas and balles or serve to depict actresses in costumes). Like his compatriots (Grigol Robakidze, Konstantine Gamsakhurdia), Gudiashvili freely used mythological allegories (The Walk of Seraphita, 1940), the center of which was a graciously beautiful woman imagined as the mysterious \\"Goddess of the Earth.\\" Gudiashvili also worked as a monumentalist, painting anew the Kashveti Church in Tbilisi in 1946, for which he was expelled from the Communist Party and fired from the Tbilisi academy of fine arts, where he had been teaching since 1926. In the voluminous \\"antifascist cycle\\" of Indian ink drawings Gudiashvili became a kind of \\"Georgian Goya\\": beast-like monsters surrounded the ruins of art and naked \\"goddesses\\" conveyed the ideas of the death of culture. Gudiashvili worked also as a book illustrator, set and theater decorator. He died on July 20, 1980 in Tbilisi.

Early life She was born in 1738, the daughter of John Simpson and Margaret Gordon, who kept a wayside inn at Fatmacken, between Banff and Portsoy. In early life, she was employed in herding cows, and afterwards entered the house of a relation, by whom she was taught reading and sewing. During a visit to Greenock, she made the acquaintance of Robert Buchan, a working potter, whom she married. They quarrelled and separated, and in 1781 she removed with the children to Glasgow. Religious doctrines Having heard Hugh White, of the Relief church at Irvine, preach in Glasgow at the April sacrament of 1783, she wrote him a letter expressing her high approval of his sermons, and stating that no preacher she had ever previously listened to had so fully satisfied her spiritual needs. The result was that she removed to Irvine to enjoy the privilege of his ministry, and converted both him and his wife to the belief that she was a saint especially endowed and privileged by heaven, White's final conclusion being that she was the woman mentioned in the Revelation of St. John, while she declared him to be the man child she had brought forth. On account of his proclamation of these peculiar doctrines, White was deposed from thc ministry by the presbytery. In May 1784, the magistrates banished the sect from the burgh, and following the supposed guidance of the star which led the wise men to Bethlehem, they settled on the farm of New Cample, in the parish of Closeburn, Dumfriesshire. They were joined here by one of two persons in good positions in life, and their numbers ultimately reached forty-six. Mrs. Buchan, whom they named their \\"spiritual mother\\", professed to have the power of conferring the Holy Ghost by breathing, and also laid claim to certain prophetic gifts. They believed in the millennium as close at hand, and were persuaded that they would not taste of death, but would be taken up to meet Christ in the air. The following account of them by Robert Burns, the poet, may be accepted as strictly accurate: \\"Their tenets are a strange jumble of enthusiastic jargon; among others she pretends to give them the Holy Ghost by breathing on them, which she does with postures and gestures that are scandalously indecent. They have likewise a community of goods, and live nearly an idle life, carrying on a great farce of pretended devotion in hams and woods, where they lodge and lie together, and hold likewise a community of women, as it is another of their tenets that they can commit no mortal sin\\". It is affirmed that Robert Burns had an attachment to a young woman, Jean Gardner, who joined the Buchanites, and that he spent a whole night and day in vainly endeavouring to persuade her to return. His song \\"As I was a walking\\" was set to an air to which, according to him, the \\"Buchanites had set some of their nonsensical rhymes,\\" for the composition of hymns was one of the gifts of Buchan. In 1785, White issued Divine Dictionary, written by himself and \\"revised and approven by Elspeth Simpson\\". The death of Mrs. Buchan, in May 1791, dissipated the faith of most of her followers. White pretended that she was only in a trance, and had her buried clandestinely, but he afterwards renounced his belief in her promise to return and conduct them to the New Jerusalem. The last survivor of the sect was Andrew Innes, who died in 1846.  Popular culture  Robert Burns refers to the Buchanites in some of his personal letters. The following lines attributed to him are thought to relate to Elspeth Buchan: :\\"The wicked ane frae Glasgow came, :In April auchty-three, :An' lodged her spawn among the saun, :An' noo her fry we see.\\" Buchan and her followers are the subject of a 1937 novella by F. L. Lucas, The Woman Clothed with the Sun, which takes the form of an account, written by a Scottish minister in middle age, of his youthful bewitchment by Elspeth and of his curious sojourn among the Buchanites.Lucas, F. L., The Woman Clothed with the Sun (London, 1937; New York, 1938) Scots playwright Hamish MacDonald and Dogstar Theatre brought the tale of Elspeth Buchan and her followers to the stage after discovering the story in a local guidebook.

The brighter component, Œ∂ Aquarii A (also called Œ∂2 Aquarii), is a yellow-white-hued F-type main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of +4.42. Its companion, Œ∂ Aquarii B (also called Œ∂1 Aquarii), is a yellow-white-hued F-type subgiant with an apparent magnitude of +4.51. The fact that their brightness is so similar makes the pair easy to measure and resolve. Zeta Aquarii A is known to be an astrometric binary system, as it undergoes regular perturbations from its orbit. It has a 26-year orbital period and a semimajor axis of 0.11‚Ä≥. The secondary's mass is . Zeta Aquarii is currently a northern hemisphere object. In 2004 it was directly above the celestial equator, and before that it was located south of it.

It can also be watched live on YouTube and the X96 website. The show features hosts Kerry Jackson, Bill Allred, and Gina Barberi. Rolling Stone cited KXRK as one of the top-five rock and roll radio stations in the U.S., and reported that Radio From Hell was one of the longest-running local radio programs in the U.S.; secondary coverage at ; see also History The show originated on Ogden's KJQ as \\"The Fun Pigs\\", hosted by Jackson and Allred in 1986. It was later retitled to Radio From Hell for being \\"the radio show for people who feel like hell in the morning\\". Jackson and Allred were among five out of twenty-five employees who did not quit KJQ in December 1991. Many members of the former KJQ staff founded a new station, KXRK, which premiered in February 1992. The new station featured Bill Allred and Dom Casual in a morning show called \\"Project X with Dom and Bill\\"; they were among many ex-KJQ personalities on the initial lineup on KXRK.; other ex-KJQ DJs included Andrea Gappmayer (mid- day), Mike Summers (afternoon), Todd Nuke'em (evening), and Chet Tapp (overnight). Kerry Jackson continued to host a morning show on KJQ, working briefly with several other hosts including Mo Mellady (who lasted less than a month) and Clyde Lewis, becoming KJQ program director in May, 1993. Jackson worked for a time on KZHT before joining KXRK on October 18, 1993, where he replaced Dom Casual in the mornings. Dom Casual left for the Augusta, Georgia market, but would return to the Salt Lake market to play a role in the founding of KENZ and as program director for the new (Simmons Media Group) KJQN. Reunited, Jackson and Allred resumed calling their show \\"Radio From Hell.\\" On May 20, 1996, Gina Barberi joined the program. Barberi had been hosting a morning show on KUTQ called \\"Woody and Barberi\\" with co-host Scott Woodmansee; she had been working as a mid-day DJ at KUTQ before moving to this position. KUTQ changed to KURR \\"Rock 99\\" later that year, and is now KJMY. Gina had worked at KJQ in the late 1980s when she was 19 and still a student at the University of Utah. Radio From Hell aired its 5000th episode in August 2008, and a 7500th episode celebration is being planned for September 20207500th Radio From Hell Episode https://x96.com/radio-from- hell/?futurishared=626&station;=KXRK#.Xk_zO3uOhQw.twitter. It is currently still on the air Monday through Friday 6:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m. (MST) Basic Format Radio From Hell (RFH) begins each morning at 5:00 A.M. Mountain Time. During the 5:00 A.M. hour, the previous day's 9:00 A.M - 10:00 A.M. segment of the previous show airs, interwoven with sound clips from various movies and television series. The live show runs from 6:00 A.M. and ends near 10:00 A.M. The hosts regularly relate humorous anecdotes about their families, friends, jobs, pets, eating habits, shopping trips, vacations and other experiences. The show incorporates several regular features and guests noted below. Radio From Hell's hosts, especially Jackson and Allred, are known for being socially and politically liberal. They frequently discuss the LDS Church, Utah state liquor laws and many other idiosyncrasies of Utah life and culture. Listeners are called \\"friends of the program\\" and the show currently has a fairly active live chat room attached to the live video feed with regular listeners. Listeners can also text the show. X96 is currently part of the Broadway Media group<http://broadwaymediagroup.com/about/ =Mission statement= The show's mission statement is occasionally played before the show begins. Allred reads the announcement, with music in the background. > \\"It is our mission to embrace the idea that our show shall always strive to > belittle the stupid and to play an occasional song.

So let it be written. So let it be done.\\" Hosts =Kerry Jackson= Kerry Jack Jackson grew up in Salem, Utah and graduated from Spanish Fork High School. He currently lives in Salt Lake City with his Korean-American wife, Sue. Jackson often references and discusses his love for geek culture including video games, comic books (Marvel Comics, not DC Comics), and science-fiction movies and television series such as Star Trek and Star Wars. One of his favorite video games is the Lego Star Wars series. His large toy collection consists of Batman, Star Trek, Star Wars, and Marvel Comics action figures . Kerry regularly plays audio clips from the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim lineup including Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Space Ghost Coast to Coast, Sealab 2021, Squidbillies, Saul of the Mole Men, and Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!. For over a decade, Jackson has served as the host of \\"The Geek Show\\", which is now in podcast form called GeekShow Podcast. It can be found on iTunes, Stitcher and its own website www.geekshowpodcast.com http://www.geekshowpodcast.com His experience with GeekShow(as well as his status in the geek community in Salt Lake) has led him to being an important consultant for the programming segment of the Salt Lake FanX Convention. Jackson has moderated or participated in panels since the con's inception, most notably Tom Holland in 2019.https://www.sltrib.com/artsliving/2019/09/07/fanx-tom-holland-talks/. Jackson currently serves on the FanX Community Council https://fanxsaltlake.com/about/community-council/ Jackson often recounts his adventurous weekend experiences (usually involving his fondness for mixed drinks), offers humorous pickup lines, and occasionally performs impressions of celebrities including Larry Flynt, Roy Horn, Lou Ferrigno, and Owen Wilson. Kerry has claimed that he has an innate talent for recreating the voices of handicapped celebrities. Kerry also does the voice of the character, \\"Frank Chryst\\", a celebrity-reporter who is perpetually grieving over the \\"horrible, terrible tragedy\\" of a recently publicized celebrity death. Jackson also has been candid and jocular about his suffering from possibly a combination of personality disorders, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and social anxiety. He says he lies in bed and hears songs or phrases repeat themselves over and over. Mostly these intrusive and repetitive thoughts are Warner Bros. themed. Also in early 2007, Bill was allowed to read an email from a listener that had seen Jackson shopping, who was noticeably irate and wrathful, due to being surrounded by too many people. Jackson is also a survivor of testicular cancer and often makes jokes about how he now only has one real testicle. Jackson had a bit part in the film The Singles Ward, but has disavowed his role in the film because he felt it was simply not funny. Despite his best efforts, however, he was offered a part in a proposed sequel. Jackson is also responsible for recording, selecting and playing the majority of the sound clips on the show; Allred has described Jackson as the Don Letts of Radio From Hell (referencing Lett's role in rock group Big Audio Dynamite). Kerry attempted to participate in The World Series of Pop Culture. After traveling to California, his team, \\"Shatner's Midnight Runners\\" passed the written exam and were allowed to audition for the producers. They were ultimately cut from the contest and sent home with a calendar for their trouble. =Bill Allred= A native of Ogden, Utah, Allred was born Ralph William Allred. He attended Ben Lomond High School, then graduated from the theater program at Weber State University, and did some graduate work at Penn State University. Allred actually finished all of his coursework at Penn State University, but told his professors that he would mail in his Thesis for his Masters in Theatre art. The rough draft for that thesis is in a briefcase under his bed at this very moment. According to Allred, while at Penn State he was attacked by squirrels and, therefore, no longer cares for the small animals. Bill fell into radio work by accident, starting with an overnight shift. Allred tends to be the most intellectual of the three hosts, reading such magazines as The Economist, and frequently referring to \\"tuna salad\\" as \\"salad ni√ßoise\\". He also enjoys biking, camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities. In 2012, he trekked from Kathmandu to base camp at Mount Everest (although he did not go to the summit) and provided several recorded updates of his trip for the show. He currently lives in downtown Salt Lake City with his wife, \\"Mrs. Bill\\", his son \\"Little Bill\\", his daughter \\"Little Mrs. Bill\\", and his two cats, Mr. Fluffy Pants and Klaus. (His former cats G. Gordon Liddy and Rush Limbaugh have passed.) Bill is a fan of movies, having gone so far as to say that he would like to be able to see every movie that is released, even the really bad movies. Some of Bill's stories relate to raising his live-in family as well as a family from a previous marriage who still live in Ogden. He is often trying to discover educational outings for his intellectually curious son \\"Little Bill\\". One such trip led to a children's library and a tour of a giant colon model. \\"Little Bill\\" has continued to grow and is now taller than his dad; Bill often talks about his obsession with Halloween, dressing up and gore make-up on the show. In 2019, a running joke on the show involved \\"Little Bill's\\" fascination with a raccoon carcass which found and proceeded to learn how to mount for display. Bill has spoken on air about his brother Noal, who died as a result of suicide on September 23, 2009. Allred stated on the September 22, 2011 broadcast of the Radio From Hell show, that he has some of his brother's ashes in a box in his basement. (Also, by coincidence, his wife's sister died on the same day, though not by suicide.) As a result, Bill is outspoken about suicide awareness and participates in the \\"Out of the Darkness\\" suicide walk in Salt Lake City each year. Bill also shares anecdotes about his mother Nola, who died in 2013, and occasionally his father and step-father. His sister owns a restaurant in Ogden called \\"Two-Bit Street\\". Bill regularly performs different voices and impressions during his reading of the news. The most popular include his German, Swedish, and Namibian accents. Also popular is his Strom Thurmond-like impression of Utah Legislator Chris Buttars and his bloviating reproduction of former U.S. Congressman Chris Cannon. In the past, Bill frequently appeared as William Shatner in order to wish friends of the program a \\"Happy Birthday\\", though appearance of this feature has become rare in recent years. In 2007, Bill performed the voice of Senator Larry Craig, the infamous Senator caught by police in a Minneapolis Airport bathroom stall for sex solicitation. Allred was an extra in the Robert Altman movie Nashville. According to Bill, he is in a crowd scene and is distinguishable by his Budweiser shirt and sunglasses. He is also the star of Trent Harris' film Delightful Water Universe. Bill also currently hosts a podcast called \\"The Let's Go Eat Show\\" where he interviews local people of interest over a meal at a local restaurant. As Bill is an admitted 'foodie', these restaurants are generally locally owned and often feature unusual or high-end cuisine. Some weeks, Allred also interviews the chef, owner or other staff of the featured restaurant and releases this interview as a sort of mini-podcast. =Gina Barberi= Gina Marie Barberi grew up in Roy, Utah, the daughter of famed Utah radio show host Tom Barberi and her frequent foil of a mother, \\"The Sainted Mary Claire\\". She was remarried in February 2005 to Joe. Barberi has three children, Festus (a son from her first marriage to \\"the Pirate\\"), Jonesie and Mohammad . Gina frequently expresses her fondness for celebrity news, gossip and rumor. To that end, she receives a Cosmo subscription for each Christmas from Allred. However, in May 2007, she stated that she had \\"seen and read\\" all the magazine had to offer and no longer desired the subscription. A good deal of Gina's personal life has been made public on the air, such as her experiments with thong underwear, her breast enlargement surgery, her 800 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, her Hawaiian-based wedding, and her elementary school aged son's penchant for hard rockers AC/DC. Gina's son Festus has long told Gina that he wants to be a rock star, and as he has gotten older, has started performing with \\"The Departed\\". Gina is a picky eater, refusing to eat such common staples as cheese, tomatoes, honey, or seafood due to her dislike of their texture. When ordering a hamburger from either the Crown Burgers or Training Table restaurants, she insists on only having meat and bread. No lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, or condiments. Her husband \\"Joe\\" has attempted, largely unsuccessfully, to broaden Gina's culinary horizons.Radio From Hell Blog - November 17, 2006 Although, recently, they enacted a rule at the Jones household that there would be no special meals (not in Gina's case of course), but they're hoping to correct Festus and prevent Jonesie from being picky eaters. Gina possesses several phobias, including wind chimes, shower curtains, sculptures depicting children, mountain lions, the wind, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and killer bees. (The first two have been explained by Gina's childhood exposure to horror movies.) In order to avoid being assaulted, Gina says she pretends to talk on the phone while walking through a parking lot, and if Joe is not home she will keep her cellular phone under her pillow, and turns on the TV (which cannot be visible from any window or someone might want to steal it) so it sounds as if people are talking if she is home alone. Though Jackson and Allred will admit to occasionally exaggerating their own traits and behaviors for comedic effect, they insist that Barberi does not do so; her radio persona is not an act. Recurring Features =Boner of the Day= One feature on the show, \\"Boner of the Day\\" (formerly \\"Boners in the News\\") is referred to as the \\"feature that won't go away.\\" The term boner is now used to mean \\"a mistake\\", though the feature originally was called the \\"morning boner\\", and featured more sexual innuendo. In its current incarnation, the feature presents three current event articles that display \\"bad, stupid, or funny human behavior\\". Bill re-titles and reads the three articles. After all three candidates are read, listeners to the program can call, text, or e-mail in their votes. The story which receives the most votes is then pitted against a second set of three stories. According to Allred, this In order to be crowned \\"Boner of the Day\\". A local resident and entrepreneur, Dave \\"The Flower Guy\\" Matson enters the studio on Friday, towards the end of the show, to choose one of the daily winners as \\"Boner of the Week\\", In 2006, an attempt has been made to crown \\"Boner of the Month\\", \\"Boner of the Quarter\\", and \\"Boner of the Year\\" using online web polls. This attempt did not succeed. Controversy In 2004, an advertising campaign for the show caused rumors that a same-sex marriage proposal was afoot in the area. \\"Rainbox billboards\\" featured the likeness of a typical, small-town Christian church in front of a rainbow, with the caption \\"Alternative Lifestyle? 'Til Death Do Us Part, \\" during an election season in which Utah voters were faced with the question of passing an anti-gay marriage amendment. Awards Radio From Hell has won the Salt Lake City Weekly's reader's-choice award for Best Radio Show every year since the category was introduced: 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005. 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019https://www.cityweekly.net/utah/best-of- utah-2019/BestOf?oid=14409340&storyPage;=2. Radio From Hell is the longest running radio morning show in the Salt Lake City, Utah area, in its 34th year as of 2020. Radio From Hell is the highest rated radio show by 18-34 year olds in the Salt Lake City market, according to Arbitron's Summer 2006 report. In its 2006 summer double issue, Rolling Stone named KXRK (Radio From Hell's host station) as one of the top five rock stations in the country.

It was opened in 1867 by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.  Usage  From 1896 there was a junction to the Liverpool Overhead Railway between North Mersey Branch Junction and Gladstone Dock. Aintree Racecourse station opened around 1890 as the only station on the line and saw its last service on 25 March 1961. It only operated on race days at Aintree Racecourse. Gladstone Dock station opened on 7 September 1914, when the section of track from North Mersey Branch Junction was electrified, and closed on 7 July 1924. Two more stations on the line opened on 1 June 1906 with the electrification of the line; these closed on 2 April 1951. Freight trains ran from Edge Hill and further in the country along the North Mersey Branch to Aintree Container Base, situated at the site of Ford Railway Station. Some ran further east to Fazakereley Yard via Sefton Jc. Grand National Express trains ran from London and other locations in the country, direct to Aintree Station via the North Mersey Branch and Bootle Branch Line which has a direct connection to the WCML. In 1988 the decision was made by BR to cancel the Grand National Express for good due to attacks from vandals at two locations along the line. Missiles, bricks and other objects would be thrown at the train when coming down to the old site of Spellow Station in Walton (Bootle Branch line), therefore giving this cutting the title ‚ÄúBomb Alley‚Äù and then further North in Litherland on the old site of the North Mersey Junction at the end of crossover above the Merseyrail Northern Line. BR made the decision to stop after too many of their trains and coaches were arriving into Aintree with significant damage. In 1986 the line to Aintree Container Base was cut leaving no further need for container trains along the line. In 1987 the short spur to Fazakerley sidings was closed and the Metal Box service had finished by 1991 leaving no regular goods services on the North Mersey Branch.  Today  The section of the line between Sefton Junction and North Mersey Branch Junction is no longer maintained to basic Network Rail operational standards and as of December 2017 is completely overgrown in places. Occasional diesel-powered engineering/maintenance trains used to use the branch to access the Southport line, saving the need to reverse at Sandhills. For trains to access the branch, a key must first be obtained in advance from the Merseyrail IECC signalling centre which unlocks the gate allowing access to/from the branch line at Aintree. The line is largely single track and is not electrified. As of October 2020, much of the North Mersey Branch is completely invisible under overgrowth in most places. However the spur behind Aintree Station, that formerly housed the Grand National platforms, was severed from the branch junction in favour of an electrical power supply cabinet installed by Network Rail. A section of rail on the Leeds Liverpool Canal Bridge between Bootle New Strand and Bootle Oriel Road was cut during the bridges renovation and replacement. Although it does seem that the track on the bridge has been reinstalled.  Future  Plans to open this section as part of Merseyrail's Northern Line have been put forward in Sefton's transport plan, with the first details to emerge about its possible reopening being published by the media on 28 February 2008. The Crosby Herald newspaper reported that the line could be reopened in conjunction with a proposed new stadium for Liverpool F.C., to provide additional transport links via the town of Litherland, likely to cost millions.Litherland in line for a new station This was again mentioned in Merseytravel's 30-year plan of 2014.

Environmental vegetarianism is the practice of vegetarianism when motivated by the desire to create a sustainable diet that avoids the negative environmental impact of meat production. Livestock as a whole is estimated to be responsible for around 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, significant reduction in meat consumption has been advocated by, among others, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in their 2019 special report and as part of the 2017 World Scientists' Warning to Humanity. Other than climate change, environmental concerns about the production of animal products may also relate to pollution, deforestation, unsustainability and the use of water and land. Environmental impact of animal products Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector. According to the 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) report Livestock's Long Shadow, animal agriculture contributes on a \\"massive scale\\" to global warming, air pollution, land degradation, energy use, deforestation, and biodiversity decline. The FAO report estimates that the livestock (including poultry) sector (which provides draft animal power, leather, wool, milk, eggs, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, etc., in addition to meat) contributes about 18 percent of global GHG emissions expressed as 100-year CO2 equivalents. This estimate was based on life-cycle analysis, including feed production, land use changes, etc., and used GWP (global warming potential) of 23 for methane and 296 for nitrous oxide, to convert emissions of these gases to 100-year CO2 equivalents. The FAO report concluded that \\"the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global\\". The report found that livestock's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions was greater than that of the global transportation sector; this conclusion was criticized in 2010 by Frank Mitloehner of the University of California, Davis, who noted that the authors had not performed a similar life-cycle analysis for transportation, causing the relative contribution of animal agriculture to be overestimated. A 2009 study by the Worldwatch Institute argued that the FAO's report had underestimated impacts related to methane, land use and respiration, placing livestock at 51% of total global emissions. According to a 2002 paper: > The industrial agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil > at unsustainable rates. It contributes to numerous forms of environmental > degradation, including air and water pollution, soil depletion, diminishing > biodiversity, and fish die-offs. Meat production contributes > disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to > livestock to produce meat‚Äîinstead of feeding it directly to humans‚Äîinvolves > a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than > other forms of food production. ... One personal act that can have a > profound impact on these issues is reducing meat consumption.

Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef > (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year, even modest reductions in meat > consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our > natural resources. The environmental impacts of animal production vary with the method of production, although \\"[overall] impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes\\". =Methane= A 2017 study published in the journal Carbon Balance and Management found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates, based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. =Land use= A 2003 paper published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, after calculating effects on energy, land, and water use, concluded that meat- based diets require more resources and are less sustainable than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets. \\"The water required for a meat-eating diet is twice as much needed for a 2,000-litre-a-day vegetarian diet\\". According to Cornell University scientists: \\"The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable\\". However, they also write: \\"The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet. In this limited sense, the lactoovovegetarian diet is more sustainable than the average American meat-based diet.\\" One of these Cornell scientists has advised that the US could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat. He \\"depicted grain-fed livestock farming as a costly and nonsustainable way to produce animal protein\\", but \\"distinguished grain-fed meat production from pasture-raised livestock, calling cattle-grazing a more reasonable use of marginal land\\". =Land degradation= Another agricultural effect is on land degradation. Cattle are a known cause for soil erosion through trampling of the ground and overgrazing.C.Michael Hogan. 2009. Overgrazing. Encyclopedia of Earth. Sidney Draggan, topic ed.; Cutler J. Cleveland, ed., National council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC Much of the world's crops are used to feed animals. With 30 percent of the earth's land devoted to raising livestock, a major cutback is needed to keep up with growing population. Demand for meat is expected to double by 2050; in China, for example, where vegetable-based diets were once the norm, demand for meat will continue to be great in absolute terms, even though demand growth will slow. As countries are developing, incomes are increasing, and consumption of animal products is associated with prosperity. This growing demand is unsustainable. A grazing- based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pests with less pesticides by rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a desertification process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than the same kind of soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans.Bharati et al. 2002. Agroforestry Systems 56: 249-257 =Biodiversity loss= The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that the primary driver of biodiversity loss is human land use, which deprives other species of land needed for their survival, with the meat industry playing a significant role in this process. Around 25% of earth's ice-free land is used for cattle rearing. Other studies have also warned that meat consumption is accelerating mass extinctions globally. A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund attributed 60% of biodiversity loss to the land needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals. A May 2018 study stated that while wildlife has been decimated since the dawn of human civilization, with wild mammals plummeting by 83%, livestock populations reared by humans for consumption have increased. Livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). As for birds, 70% are domesticated, such as poultry, whereas only 30% are wild. =Water= Animal production has a large impact on water pollution and usage. According to the Water Education Foundation, it takes 2,464 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef in California, whereas it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce one pound of wheat. Raising a large amount of livestock creates a massive amount of manure and urine, which can pollute natural resources by changing the pH of water, contaminates the air, and emits a major amount of gas that directly affects global warming. As most livestock are raised in small confined spaces to cut down on cost, this increases the problem of concentrated waste. Livestock in the United States produces 2.7 trillion pounds of manure each year, which is ten times more than what is produced by the entire U.S. population. There are issues with how animal waste is disposed, as some is used as fertilizer while some farmers create manure lagoons which store millions of gallons of animal waste which is extremely unsafe and detrimental to the environment. Relation to other arguments Although motivations frequently overlap, environmental vegetarians and vegans can be contrasted with those who are primarily motivated by concerns about animal welfare (one kind of ethical vegetarianism), health, or who avoid meat to save money or out of necessity (economic vegetarianism). Some also believe vegetarianism will improve global food security, or curb starvation. =Health= A study in Climate Change concluded \\"if ... average diets among UK adults conformed to WHO recommendations, their associated GHG emissions would be reduced by 17%. Further GHG emission reductions of around 40% could be achieved by making realistic modifications to diets so that they contain fewer animal products and processed snacks and more fruit, vegetables and cereals.\\" A study in The Lancet estimated that the \\"30% reduction in livestock production\\" by 2030 required to meet the UK Committee on Climate Change's agricultural would also result in a roughly 15% decrease in ischaemic heart disease. Environmental vegetarians call for a reduction of first world consumption of meat, especially in the US. According to the United Nations Population Fund, \\"Each U.S. citizen consumes an average of 260 lbs. of meat per year, the world's highest rate. That is about 1.5 times the industrial world average, three times the East Asian average, and 40 times the average in Bangladesh.\\" In addition, \\"the ecological footprint of an average person in a high-income country is about six times bigger than that of someone in a low-income country, and many more times bigger than in the least-developed countries\\". A 2018 report published in PNAS asserted that farmers in the United States could sustain more than twice as many people than they do currently if they abandoned rearing farm animals for human consumption and instead focused on growing plants. The World Health Organization calls malnutrition \\"the silent emergency\\", and says that it is a factor in at least half of the 10.4 million child deaths which occur every year.http://www.tradeobservatory.org/library.cfm?refID=48538 Some argue that the adoption of an ovo-lacto vegetarian or entirely plant-based vegan diet is best, but may not be totally necessary, because even modest reductions in meat consumption in industrialized societies would substantially reduce the burden on natural resources. For developed countries, a CAST report estimates an average of 2.6 pounds of grain feed per pound of beef carcass meat produced. For developing countries, the estimate is 0.3 pounds per pound. (Some very dissimilar figures are sometimes seen; the CAST report discusses common sources of error and discrepancies among such figures.)Bradford, E. et al. 1999. Animal Agriculture and Global Food Supply. Council on Agricultural Science and Technology. 92 pp. In 2007, US per capita beef consumption was 62.2 pounds per year, and US per capita meat (red meat plus fish plus poultry) consumption totaled 200.7 pounds (boneless trimmed weight basis).USDA. 2010. Agricultural Statistics 2010, Table 13-7 Support Globalization and modernization has resulted in Western consumer cultures spreading to countries like China and India, including meat-intensive diets which are supplanting traditional plant-based diets. More than 200 billion animals are consumed by a global population of over 7 billion annually, which philosopher and animal rights activist Steven Best argues is \\"completely unsustainable\\". A 2018 study published in Science states that meat consumption is set to increase by some 76% by 2050 as the result of human population growth and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce biodiversity. A 2018 report in Nature found that a significant reduction in meat consumption is necessary to mitigate climate change, especially as the population rises to a projected 10 billion in the coming decades. According to a 2019 report in The Lancet, global meat consumption needs to be reduced by 50 percent to mitigate for climate change. In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a Warning to Humanity calling for, among other things, drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of meat. A 2010 report from the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) International Panel of Sustainable Resource Management stated: > Impacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to > population growth and increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike > fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. > A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial > worldwide diet change, away from animal products. The aforementioned Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services also suggested that a reduction in meat consumption would be required to help preserve biodiversity. According to a July 2019 report by the World Resources Institute the global population will increase to roughly 10 billion by the middle of the century, with demand for ruminant meat rising by 88%. The report posits that Americans and Europeans will need to reduce their beef consumption by 40% and 22% respectively in order to feed so many people and at the same time avert an ecological catastrophe. In November 2019, a warning on the \\"climate emergency\\" from over 11,000 scientists from over 100 countries said that \\"eating mostly plant-based foods while reducing the global consumption of animal products, especially ruminant livestock, can improve human health and significantly lower GHG emissions (including methane in the ‚ÄúShort-lived pollutants‚Äù step).\\" The warning also says it this will \\"free up croplands for growing much-needed human plant food instead of livestock feed, while releasing some grazing land to support natural climate solutions.\\" A 2020 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Tulane University, which was commissioned by the Center for Biological Diversity, asserts that if the U.S. cut its meat consumption by half, it could result in diet-related GHG emissions being reduced by 35%, a decline of 1.6 billion tons. Criticism Bill Mollison has argued in his Permaculture Design Course that vegetarianism exacerbates soil erosion. This is because removing a plant from a field removes all the nutrients it obtained from the soil, while removing an animal leaves the field intact. On US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops.NRCS. 2009. Summary report 2007 national resources inventory. USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. 123 pp. Robert Hart has also developed forest gardening, which has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element, as a sustainable plant-based food production system. Some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change. Environmentalist Dave Riley states that \\"being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us\\", and notes that Mollison \\"insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost\\". According to a study published in PNAS, U.S. GHG emissions would only be decreased by 2.6% (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions) if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets. This study's underlying assumptions however were heavily criticized. In a followup letter the authors refuted the criticism and defended their work.

The locomotive first worked with a 3500-gallon tender, but this was changed for a 4000-gallon tender in 1938. In 1941, Kinlet Hall ran into a bomb crater after a bombing raid at Plymouth, and was severely damaged. In 1955, Kinlet Hall was fitted with manganese steel liners (rather than the usual bronze liners) to the main axle boxes. This was unique among GWR locomotives. alt=In a black and white photograph, a locomotive (seen from the front and right) is pulling a freight train, of which can be seen a number of open Kinlet Hall working a freight train at Swindon in 1958 At various times, the locomotive was allocated to Cardiff Canton, Laira, Old Oak Common, Oswestry, Oxley, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Stafford Road, Swindon, Truro, and finally Cardiff East Dock. After completing more than in service, Kinlet Hall was withdrawn from service with British Railways in January 1964 and sold for scrap to Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, South Wales in June later that year. Preservation Kinlet Hall under restoration in 1983 In 1981, it was bought by the Kinlet Hall Locomotive Company and moved to Peak Rail at Matlock where restoration work began. It was moved to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway in 1985, followed by the Llangollen Railway in 1992. In 1996, it was moved to Tyseley Locomotive Works for final restoration. The locomotive returned to operational condition in February 2000, and following certification for mainline operation, it made several mainline trips to various parts of the country, sometimes in company with fellow Tyseley resident 4965 Rood Ashton Hall. The inaugural trip in question was Vintage Trains' SLS Special from Birmingham Snow Hill to Didcot on 17 June 2000. It visited the West Somerset Railway Jubilee gala 2001. It has since visited several of its former homes in preservation, returning to Llangollen in June 2001, and to the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway, for much of the 2004/2005 operating season. In 2006, it was fitted with the On-Train Monitoring Recorder (OTMR) equipment at Tyseley, and a full retube was undertaken during the first part of 2007. Between October 2007 and March 2008, the engine visited the East Lancashire Railway. The fitting of OTMR has allowed it to provide motive power for various mainline excursions, including Vintage Trains' Shakespeare Express and the Three Choirs Express excursion, double-heading with 5029 Nunney Castle. After attending West Somerset Railway Spring Steam Gala 2009, visiting the Severn Valley Railway for summer 2009, and being displayed at the Tyseley Open Day on 25 October 2009, it was dismantled over the winter for a thorough overhaul, which was completed in around 20 months. The engine was on display at the Tyseley Open Days on 25‚Äì26 June 2011, and test running on the mainline commenced shortly afterwards. The locomotive visited the North Norfolk Railway in March 2012, before visiting the Dartmouth Steam Railway between June and October 2012, hauling regular service trains on the line alongside the railway's own fleet of locomotives, and also attended the Nene Valley Railway in September. It then moved to the West Somerset Railway in October 2012 via the mainline. The locomotive spent 2013 hauling railtours on the mainline, before going on loan to the Severn Valley again, from September 2013 to late March 2014. After reaching an operational agreement, it spent the 2014 season on the West Somerset Railway, including the Autumn gala. It was then agreed that it would remain at the West Somerset Railway during 2015, although a planned visit to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway for that line's spring steam gala in April didn't occur. In April 2015, it was announced that Kinlet Hall Ltd and WSR plc had agreed a five-year residency period for the locomotive, to be based at Minehead. The agreement allows for periods of both mainline running and visits to other preserved railways events. In summer 2016, it was announced that the firebox brick arch had been found to be broken beyond repair, causing firebox and boiler damage, and resultantly her mainline certificate was withdrawn. Faced with a period of limited running and no mainline income, director Jon Jones- Pratt agreed to buy-out the other share holders, and pay for a full mainline certified overhaul. The engine ran on the WSR until Autumn 2016, before moving back to Tyseley Locomotive Works for a complete overhaul.Railway Magazine, P12, July 2015https://www.national-preservation.com/threads/4936-kinlet-hall- update.762979/ Models In 2005 Bachmann produced an OO gauge model of Kinlet Hall in GWR green with crest.

The term was first used by Alphonse de Candolle. Other terms with the same meaning are hapaxanth and semelparous. The antonym is polycarpic, a plant that flowers and sets seeds many times during its lifetime; the antonym of semelparous is iteroparous. Plants which flower en masse (gregariously) before dying are known as plietesials. The term hapaxanth is most often in conjunction with describing some of the taxa of Arecaceae (palms) and some species of bamboo, but rarely used otherwise; its antonym is pleonanth. This was first used by Alexander Braun. The plant can live a number of years before it will flower. Flowering in some plants signals senescence while in others plants the production of fruits and seeds causes changes within the plants which lead to death. These changes are induced by chemicals that act as hormones, redirecting the resources of the plants from the roots and leaves to the production of fruits and or seeds. The century plant in the genus Agave, some terrestrial bromeliads of the genus Puya, Tillandsia utriculata, some yuccas, and many bamboos can take 8 to 20 years or in the case of some bamboos even over 100 years to bloom and then die.

Early years  1964 40+10 Pfennig, Special stamp of the Deutsche Post of the GDR with Arvid Harnack and his wife Mildred Stolperstein at Genthiner Stra√üe 14 in Tiergarten Harnack was the son of literary history professor Otto Harnack, the elder brother of Falk Harnack, Inge Harnack and Angela Harnack as well as the nephew of theologian Adolf von Harnack. From 1919 to 1923, he studied law in Jena (at the Friedrich Schiller University), Graz, and Hamburg and became a Doctor of Law in 1924. From 1926 to 1928, he studied economics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the United States, where, in 1926, he married the literary historian Mildred Fish. In 1929-1930 he became a Doctor of Philosophy in Gie√üen, producing as his thesis Die vormarxistische Arbeiterbewegung in den Vereinigten Staaten (\\"The Pre- Marxist Workers' Movement in the United States\\"). Along with the Gie√üen economist Friedrich Lenz, he founded the Wissenschaftliche Arbeitsgemeinschaft zum Studium der sowjetischen Planwirtschaft (\\"Scientific Working Community for the Study of the Soviet Planned Economy\\"), or ARPLAN in 1931. Harnack was made First Secretary of this group, which counted about 50 members. At the height of the Great Depression, Harnack's hope, apparently, was that Germany could serve as a spiritual and economic bridge between East and West. The first meeting of the group took place on 3 and 4 January 1932. In August and September of the same year, a three-week trip to the Soviet Union was organized with the help of the Soviet embassy in Berlin. The Soviet economy was observed in Moscow, Leningrad, Odesa, Kiew, and in the Dnieper region. Trips to the United States in 1937 and 1939 would follow, during which Harnack unsuccessfully tried to create a basis of communication with Washington. Resistance Memorial stone for Arvid and Mildred Harnack at the Zehlendorf cemetery in Berlin In 1933, after Hitler's rise to power made it necessary to dissolve ARPLAN, Harnack was given a post as a scientific expert in the Reich Economic Ministry. The same year, he also finished his legal qualifications in Jena, successfully completing the junior law examination. Together with his wife, Mildred, the writer, Adam Kuckhoff, and his wife, Greta, Harnack assembled a discussion circle which debated political perspectives on the time after the National Socialists' expected downfall or overthrow. By 1935, Harnack was active as a lecturer on foreign policy at the University of Berlin. From 1937‚Äì41, Harnack, through a contact of his American wife, Mildred, held close contact with Donald Heath, the First Secretary at the US Embassy, to inform the US about Hitler's preparations for war. In 1941, after the Americans left Berlin, Harnack was contacted by the Soviets and agreed to supply them with information about Hitler's war preparations. Unbeknownst to him, they applied the code names Balte and Corsican to him. While Harnack's relations with the Americans had been based on a mutual friendship with Heath, his relation with the Soviets was reluctant, as he didn't trust Stalin. As a cover, Harnack became a member of the NSDAP in 1937. In 1935 came his first contact with Harro Schulze-Boysen, an air force lieutenant and descendant of an old German military family, and, in 1940, with the Communists Hilde Rake and Hans Coppi, as well as with socialists like Adolf Grimme. The resulting network was far-reaching and didn't have a name. After the arrests, the Gestapo labeled them Red Orchestra (Rote Kapelle). In the Gestapo's terms, a spy hitting Morse codes was a pianist, a group of pianists formed an orchestra, and, as Communists, they were red. In reality, the resistance group had members from all walks of life. Membership included people from all social classes and age groups, and also from varied religious ideologies, e.g., mainly communist and National Bolshevik, and Jews and Christians. The group was also 40% female. In 1941, Harnack sent the Soviets information about the forthcoming invasion. That same year, he published the resistance magazine, Die innere Front (\\"The Inner Front\\"). At about the same time, he received information from Rudolf von Scheliha about the Final Solution.  Trial and death  CIC file ref. Mildred Harnack (about 1947) In 1941, through a Soviet military blunder, addresses of members of the group were transmitted across Europe in an attempt by the Soviets to re-connect with the resisters. A year later, in July 1942, the Decryption Department of the Oberkommando des Heeres managed to decode the group's radio messages, and the Gestapo pounced. On 7 September, Arvid and Mildred Harnack were arrested. Arvid Harnack was sentenced to death on 19 December after a four-day trial before the Reichskriegsgericht (\\"Reich Military Tribunal\\"), and was put to death three days later at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. Hitler re-instated the death by hanging for them and secretly had the meat hooks installed at Pl√∂tzensee, which became publicly known only 2 1/2 years later during the July 20th executions. Harnack's wife Mildred was originally given six years in prison, but Hitler swiftly cancelled the sentence and ordered a new trial, which pronounced the desired death sentence. After execution, both of their bodies were released to Hermann Stieve, anatomy professor at Humboldt University, to be dissected for research. A cenotaph was installed for them after the war by Arvid's brother Falk Harnack, a member of the White Rose resistance group, at Zehlendorf Cemetery, the location of their remains is unknown. Awards and honours * On 6 October 1969, Harnack was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner. This honour proved to be dubious today, as it mistakenly interpreted the group as a communist network of spies who had spied on the Soviets. This interpretation of the resistance group, based on original slander by the Gestapo, was used in a mirrored way in the West, in which the rebels were not honoured there, but persecuted as traitors until the 1970s. * In Magdeburg, a street called Harnackstra√üe is named after him and Mildred, as well as similar named streets in the Lichtenberg, Berlin and Reudnitz in Leipzig. * In Jena a street known as the Arvid-Harnack-Stra√üe, is named after him. * In the courtyard location at Unter den Linden 6 of the Humboldt University of Berlin, there is a memorial stone. * In Neuk√∂lln area of Berlin, in the Hasenheide, corner of Lilienthalstra√üe, a plaque commemorates the Harnack's and their roommate Stefan Heym.

(Alternative spelling of family name: Kranc)  Famous fables and stories  The Dubner Maggid is famous for his fables or parables designed to teach or illustrate an instructive lessons based on Jewish tradition. The most famous fable of the Dubner Maggid is about the way in which he was able to find such fitting fables. When asked about this the Maggid replied: Once I was walking in the forest, and saw tree after tree with a target drawn on it, and at the center of each target an arrow. I then came upon a little boy with a bow in his hand. \\"Are you the one who shot all these arrows?\\", I asked. \\"Yes!\\" he replied. \\"Then how did you always hit the center of the target?\\" I asked. \\"Simple\\", said the boy, \\"first I shoot the arrow, then I draw the target\\".  History  Kranz was born at Zietil (Yiddish ◊ñ◊©◊¢◊ò◊ú Zhetl)(now Dzyatlava), (then Lithuania now Belarus) in about 1740 and died at Zamo≈õƒá on 18 December 1804. At the age of eighteen he went to Miƒôdzyrzec Podlaski (Meseritz), where he occupied the position of preacher. He stayed there for two years, and then became preacher successively at Zolkiev, Dubno, W≈Çodawa (Lublin region), Kalisch, and Zamo≈õƒá. He remained at Dubno eighteen years and is best known for being the Rabbi here. He left Dubno for Vilnius at the request of the famous Elijah Wilna, who, having recently recovered from a sickness and being unable to study, sought diversion in his conversation. Kranz was considered to be unrivalled preacher. Possessed of great eloquence, he illustrated both his sermons and his homiletic commentaries with parables taken from human life. By such parables he explained the most difficult passages of the Tanakh, and cleared up many perplexing questions in Halakha. He was also an eminent rabbinical scholar, and on many occasions was consulted as an authority. Confronted with imposters there were several tests that Kranz would go through to prove he was the true Maggid, opening the Tanakh at random, and inventing parables on the spot.Dubner Parable used at Israeli court of law, 2004  Books  All of Kranz's works were published after his death by Abraham B√§r Flahm with the permission of Kranz's son Yitzhak Kranz who found the writings of the Maggid in Mezritch where he had preached. * \\"Ohel Ya'aqov\\", a homiletic commentary on the Pentateuch abounding with graphic parables (i., J√≥zef√≥w, 1830; ii., Zolkiev, 1837; iii., Vienna, 1863; iv., 1861; v., Vienna, 1859); * \\"Qol Ya'aqov\\" (Warsaw, 1819), a similar commentary on the Five Scrolls; * \\"Kokhab mi-Ya'aqov\\", a commentary on the \\"haft'arot\\"; * \\"Emet le-Ya'aqov\\" (Zolkiev, 1836), a commentary on the Passover Haggadah; * \\"Sefer ha-Middot\\" (n.p., 1862), ethics arranged in eight \\"gates\\" or sections, each section being divided into several chapters. This work resembles very much the \\"Hobot ha- Levavot\\" of Bachya. As the author himself had given no name to it, Abraham B√§r Flahm, its editor, at first intended to call it \\"Chobot ha-Lebabot he-Chadash\\" (The New Duties of the Heart, a reference to an 11th Century famous book); but out of respect for the author, Bachya, he changed his mind. The editor also revised the work, and added to it a preface containing a sketch of Kranz's life, and glosses of his own under the title \\"Shiyyure ha-Middot\\". Moses Nussbaum of Przemy≈õl extracted from the author's \\"Ohel Ya'aqob\\" all the parables, and published them in one book entitled \\"Mishle Ya'aqob\\" (Cracow, 1886). Following an open letter by Abraham Flahm printed in the popular Hagaddah that year, he agreed to print Flahm's preface in the succeeding reprints. The agreement is kept to this day. Several parables never published till modern times, but passed on orally in the family, have been written down by Moshe Kranc, a descendant of the Dubner Maggid, in a book about business and Jewish tales: \\"The Hasidic Masters' Guide to Management\\".

It is an archbishopric of the Assyrian Church of the East and is in full communion with Catholicos- Patriarch Mar Gewargis III. The Chaldean Syrian Church employs the Divine Liturgy of Saints Addai and Mari belonging to the East Syriac Rite. Its members are a part of the St. Thomas Christian (also known as Nasrani) community, who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.Leslie Brown, (1956) The Indian Christians of St. Thomas. An Account of the Ancient Syrian Church of Malabar, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1956, 1982 (repr.) They are almost exclusively based in the state of Kerala, with the church's cathedral, the Marth Mariam Cathedral, located in Thrissur. The Chaldean Syrian Church is the modern-day continuation of the historic Church of the East in India. After the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653, the Thomas Christians split into the Pazhayakuttukar, or \\"Old Party\\" faction and the Puthenkuttukar, or \\"New Party\\" faction. While the Pazhayakuttukar or \\"Old Party\\" faction accepted full communion with the Holy See of Rome, the Puthenkuttukar, or \\"New Party\\" came in full communion with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch. The Pazhayakuttukar would became the modern-day Eastern Catholic Syro-Malabar Church. The Chaldean Syrian Church descends from a small minority faction of the Syro-Malabar Church that split off in the late-19th century under Chaldean bishop Mar Elias Mellus; they eventually joined in full communion with the Assyrian Church of the East which is among the descendant churches of the historic Church of the East. The Chaldean Syrian Church shares the same liturgy with the Syro-Malabar Church. Today the Chaldean Syrian Church is one of four archbishoprics in the Assyrian Church of the East, and has about 15,000 members in and around Thrissur.Vadakkekara, pp. 101‚Äì103. History =Early history= St. Thomas Christians trace their origin to Thomas the Apostle, who is believed to have evangelized in India in the 1st century. By the 3rd century India's Christian community was part of the Church of the East, led by the Patriarch of the East in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, Persia. In the 7th century India was designated as its own ecclesiastical province, and functioned as such until the Portuguese entrance into the region in the 1500s. =Portuguese era and the schism of 1653= In 1499, the Portuguese arrived in India and used intimidation to force the St. Thomas Christian community into becoming an Eastern Catholic Church under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Goa, and as a result their Church was Latinized, their Holy books were burned, and their connection to the Church of the East in Mesopotamia was severed in what is known as the Synod of Diamper. The Portuguese set up their headquarters in Goa early in the 16th century and extended their domain to Kerala. The Archbishopric of Goa, backed by the Portuguese, claimed jurisdiction over the Syriac Christians of Malabar. The East Syriac liturgy and the Mesopotamian connection of the St. Thomas Christians lead open them to a suspicion of Nestorianism; And Archbishop Menezes of Goa, who arrived in Kerala in December 1598 was determined to bring them into the Romanized way of worship. However, The coercive actions of the Portuguese padroado system ultimately caused a faction in the community to follow Archdeacon Mar Thoma I in a rebellion against the Portuguese in 1653 which they called the Coonan Cross Oath, in which they stated they would refuse to obey the Jesuites.Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, \\"Eastern Christianity in India\\" The faction that followed Thomas were known as the Malankara Church, however, as a response to this Rome sent a different group known as Carmelites in two groups from the \\"Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples\\" to Malabar headed by Friar Sebastiani and Friar Hyacinth. The Friars first arrived in 1655, and began to deal directly with the Archdeacon, Mar Thoma I. Although he was unable to sway the Archdeacon, Fr. Sebastiani gained the support of many, including Parambil Mar Chandy, Alexandar Kadavil and the Vicar of Muttam, the three councilors of Mar Thoma I. As a result of this, Between 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Catholic Carmelites reclaimed eighty-four churches, leaving Mar Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended, while The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus of the Malankara Syrian Church,Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \\"St. Thomas Christians\\" - The Carmelite Period which was eventually turned into a West Syriac Rite church in around AD 1665 when Mar Gregorios, a Bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, arrived in India. The dissident group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him, mistaking him for an East Syriac Rite Bishop sent by the Church of the East.Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India‚Äù Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of the Bishop Mar Gregorios of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syriac theological and liturgical tradition of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch of Mar Gregorios became known as Jacobites, while The Syriac Catholics remained in communion with Rome and later in the 19th century came to be known as the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. The Chaldean Syrian Church originates from the faction which stayed with the Catholic Church. =History post-schism= The Chaldean Syrian Church's current Metropolitan, Mar Aprem Mooken, has argued that the church represents a direct continuation of the Ancient Church of the East hierarchy in India.Mar Aprem, The Assyrian Church of the East in the Twentieth Century (Kottayam: SEERI, 2003), pp. 49‚Äì51, 65 & 70. The Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Joseph Audo sent a request to Pope Pius IX for the Syro-Malabar Catholics to be placed under his authority. Without waiting for a reply, he dispatched Mar Elias Mellus, Bishop of 'Aqra, to India in July 1874. Mar Mellus had substantial success convincing Syro-Malabar Catholics in Thrissur District (from Chalakudy to Palayur (Chavakkad)) and some churches in Kottayam District to recognize him as their bishop. Although the churches were called by the name Syro-Malabar (also known as Chaldean Syrians at that time), the actual situation was that from Irinjalakuda to northwards and south of Bharathapuzha River, and in some churches in Meenachil taluk, the Syro-Malabarians (also known as Chaldean Syrians at that time) were half Catholic and half Nestorian, with an East Syriac liturgy. Nevertheless, by 1877, 24,000 followers had joined his group, based in Our Lady of Dolours Church (now Marth Mariam Cathedral) in the parish of Thrissur. In response, the Pope dispatched Latin Catholic leaders to remove Mar Mellus from the country and sent him back to Mesopotamia in 1882. By then, however, he had established the infrastructure for an independent church, which was named the Chaldean Syrian Church.Vadakkekara, p. 102 The majority of Mellus' followers returned to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, and the ancient Palayur church was returned to the Catholic Church after the death of the Chaldean Syrian head Mar Mikhail Augusthinos in 1911. However, About 8,000 followers maintained their demand for autonomy, and took their requests for an independent bishop to non-Catholic churches. In 1904 they made one such request to the Archbishop of Canterbury to get an East Syriac Bishop sent, but were declined. They subsequently made an equivalent request to Shimun XIX Benyamin, Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East in Qochanis who consented, dispatching Saint Mar Abimalek Timotheus to serve as their metropolitan bishop. Mar Abimalek Thomotheus soon revived East Syriac practices and reintroduced Nestorianism to the Thrissur church. These reforms caused even more followers to break away and rejoin the Catholic Church, but through the reforms, the original Assyrian-oriented Church of India was revived as it was prior to the Synod of Diamper in 1599.Vadakkekara, p. 103 In 1964, during the reign of Assyrian Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai, a dispute over apostolic succession and church calendars caused the Metropolitan of the Church of the East in India to break away from the Assyrian Church of the East joining itself with the Ancient Church of the East. However, in 1995, Eshai's successor, Mar Dinkha IV was able to heal the rift, and the Chaldean Syrian Church returned to his jurisdiction. The Chaldean Syrian Church in India now constitutes one of the four Archbishoprics of the Assyrian Church of the East. Its followers number around 15,000. The present Metropolitan, Mar Aprem Mooken (ordained in 1968), is headquartered in Thrissur City and is a noted author. His seat is the Marth Mariam Valiyapalli . The Chaldean Syrian Higher Secondary School is also affiliated with the church.

It is a psychological term specifically applied to psychiatric patients, and differs greatly from the daily use of the phrase \\"emotion expression\\" or another psychological concept \\"family expressiveness\\"; frequent communication and natural expression of emotion among family members is a conducive, healthy habit. Theoretically, a high level of EE in the home can worsen the prognosis in patients with mental illness, such as schizophrenia and social anxiety disorder, or act as a potential risk factor for the development of psychiatric disease. Typically it is determined whether a person or family has high EE or low EE through a taped interview known as the Camberwell Family Interview (CFI). Answers to questions and non-verbal cues are used to determine if someone has high expressed emotion. There is another measurement that is taken from the view of the patient, which rates the patient's perception of how their family feels about them and the disorder. If the patient feels that the parents are too protective, or not caring, the patient may feel that their parents don't care about their independence or trust their judgement. This attitude may cause the patient to relapse, and patients that rate their parents poorly in this test have a harder time coping with their illness if too much time is spent with the parent. An alternative measure of expressed emotion is the Five Minutes Speech Sample (FMSS), where the relatives are asked to talk about the patient for five uninterrupted minutes. Although this measure requires more training, it becomes a quicker form of assessment than the CFI. High expressed emotion Family members with high expressed emotion are hostile, very critical and not tolerant of the patient. They feel like they are helping by having this attitude. They not only criticize behaviors relating to the disorder but also other behaviors that are unique to the personality of the patient. High expressed emotion is more likely to cause a relapse than low expressed emotion. The three dimensions of high EE are hostility, emotional over-involvement and critical comments. =Hostility= Hostility is a negative attitude directed at the patient because the family feels that the disorder is controllable and that the patient is choosing not to get better. Problems in the family are often blamed on the patient and the patient has trouble problem solving in the family. The family believes that the cause of many of the family‚Äôs problems is the patient‚Äôs mental illness, whether they are or not. =Emotional over- involvement= Emotional over-involvement reflects a set of feelings and behavior of a family member towards the patient, indicating evidence of over- protectiveness or self-sacrifice, excessive use of praise or blame, preconceptions and statements of attitude. Family members who show high emotional involvement tend to be more intrusive. Therefore, families with high emotional involvement may believe that patients cannot help themselves and that their problems are due to causes external to them, and thus high involvement will lead to strategies of taking control and doing things for the patients. In addition, patients may feel very anxious and frustrated when interacting with family caregivers with high emotional involvement due to such high intrusiveness and emotional display towards them. On the whole, families with high EE appear to be poorer communicators with their ill relative as they might talk more and listen less effectively. Emotional over-involvement demonstrates a different side compared to hostile and critical attitudes but is still similar with the negative affect that causes a relapse. The relative becomes so overbearing that the patient can no longer live with this kind of stress from pity, and falls back into their illness as a way to cope. =Critical comments= Critical attitudes are combinations of hostile and emotional over-involvement. It shows an openness that the disorder is not entirely in the patients control but there is still negative criticism. Critical parents influence the patient‚Äôs siblings to be the same way. The attitudes of family members with high expressed emotion are too strong for the patient and the patient now has to deal with the mental illness and the criticism from those they would need support from in their time of recovery. This stress may cause the patient to relapse and make them fall into a cycle of rehabilitation and relapse. Then the disorder is unsustainable and rehabilitation is required. The only way to escape this cycle is for the family to go through therapy together. This will greatly lower family conflicts and the stress level of the entire household. Low expressed emotion Low expressed emotion occurs when the family members are less critical or hostile, and not overly-involved. Low expressed emotion is associated with more positive outcomes for the patient. Psychoeducation on the course and associated effects of the illness, as well as behavioral interventions and communication training can help families move from high expressed emotion to low expressed emotion. However, it is believed that in the early stages of the illness, families should be allowed to grieve and be supported emotionally, and that behavioral interventions can actually increase relapse rates at this critical juncture. High expressed emotion, by contrast, makes the patient feel trapped, out of control and dependent upon others. The patient may feel like an outsider because of the excessive attention received. Expressed emotion affects everyone in the home, raising the stress level for the family and often increasing anxiety and depression among family members. The behavior of everyone around the patient influences the course of the patient's illness. Academics suggest that movement from high to low expressed emotion is best facilitated by a family therapist, psychiatrist, or family worker, preferably one experienced in the treatment of families with a psychotic family member. Family therapists suggest that treatment is more successful with the attendance of as many household members as possible, in order to give a more complete picture of family patterns. However, the necessity of family therapy does not indicate that the illness is the fault of the family. Family therapy in this area has moved away from the notion that family communication patterns are responsible for psychosis, a notion popularized in the 1960s by family systems therapist Murray Bowen. Validity Some studies show that there is no link between expressed emotion and first episode psychosis, illness severity, age of onset, and illness length. There is also literature that links EE to the course and outcome of numerous major childhood psychiatric disorders. One study showed that one component, high parental dimensions of criticism (CRIT), can be used as an index of problematic parent‚Äìchild interactions, though the quantifiable effects of emotional overinvolvement (EOI), though doubtlessly existent and having huge effects, are not as salient in that study and need to be observed by further studies. In social anxiety disorder, it has been found parental's high level of expressed emotion (emotional overinvolvement, criticism, hostility) is strongly associated with treatment outcome in their children, so parental involvement is warranted The article \\"Expressed Emotion and Relapse of Psychopathology\\" details expressed emotion (EE) as a construct, the link between expressed emotion and relapse, evidence of causality, attributions and EE, and more information regarding the theory of EE.

The word is French for \\"shop\\", which derives ultimately from the Greek ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∏ŒÆŒ∫Œ∑ (apothƒìkƒì) or \\"storehouse\\".boutique, on Oxford Dictionaries·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∏ŒÆŒ∫Œ∑, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek- English Lexicon, on Perseus The term boutique and also designer refer (with some differences) to both goods and services which are containing some element that is claimed to justify an extremely high price. As with the fine art market, and the use of art in money laundering schemes, national governments have to be concerned with boutique shops and the high pricing of boutique goods as instruments in fraud and other financial schemes. Etymology and usage The term \\"boutique\\" entered common English parlance in the late 1960s. In Europe, Avenue Montaigne and Bond Street were the focus of much media attention for having the most fashionable stores of the era. Some multi-outlet businesses (chains) can be referred to as boutiques if they target small, upscale market niches. Although some boutiques specialize in hand-made items and other unique products, others simply produce T-shirts, stickers, and other fashion accessories in artificially small runs and sell them at high prices. Lifestyle In the late 1990s, some European retail traders developed the idea of tailoring a shop towards a lifestyle theme, in what they called \\"concept stores\\", which specialized in cross-selling without using separate departments. One of the first concept stores was 10 Corso Como in Milan, Italy, founded in 1990, followed by Colette in Paris and Quartier 206 in Berlin. Several well-known American chains such as Tiffany & Co., Urban Outfitters, Dash, and The Gap, Australian chain Billabong and, though less common, Lord & Taylor, adapted to the concept store trend after 2000.

The main breeds are: Zebu (Gir, Indu- Brasil, Guzer√° and Nelore), Girolanda, Frisian and Brown-Swiss. There is also large production of soybeans, corn, rice, beans, and also some coffee. Paracatu is the commercial center for an area one third the size of Portugal. In 2006 there were 6 banking branches: Banco do Brasil, Ita√∫, Bradesco, Banco Mercantil, Banco Bamerindus, and Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal. The GDP was R$754,090,000 (2005). In 1978 the municipality began to receive investments from the Brazilian and the Japanese government to develop the cerrado soils, through the PRODECER-Programa de Coopera√ß√£o Nipo-Brasileiro para o Desenvolviemnto do Cerrado. Because of new technologies used to develop the cerrado, agriculture in Paracatu became efficient and profitable in many properties. Nowadays, the cultivated area in the municipality surpasses 1000 square kilometres, with 300 square kilometres irrigated by central pivot sprinklers. This number has raised Paracatu to the position of greatest continuous area irrigated by center pivot irrigation in South America, using 318 center pivot sprinklers. =Agricultural data= In 2006 there were 995 rural producers with total agricultural land of 389,095 ha. Of the total 85,000 ha. were planted, 180,000 ha. were in natural pasture, and 113,000 were in forest or woodland. Around 4,500 persons were employed in agriculture. There were 768 tractors.

Her husband was Emperor An. She was known for her conspiratorial and nepotistic behavior, both as empress and (briefly) as empress dowager. However, her plan, along with her brothers, to hold on to power for a long time ultimately resulted in failure and the deaths of her clan members.  Family background and marriage to Emperor An  Yan Ji's father Yan Chang (ÈñªÊö¢) was the son of Yan Zhang (ÈñªÁ´†), an official under Emperor Ming whose two sisters were imperial consorts, and who was described as a capable official whose promotion however was halted by Emperor Ming, who did not want to appear nepotistic. When Ji was young, she was described as intelligent and beautiful, and in 107, she was selected as an imperial consort for Emperor An, who was 13, and she quickly became his favorite. In 108, he created her empress‚Äîeven though she was also described as jealous, to the extent that that year, she poisoned Consort Li, who had given birth to a son of the emperor, Liu Bao (Âäâ‰øù).  As empress  During most of Emperor An's reign, he was mostly overshadowed by his regent, Empress Dowager Deng Sui, but after Empress Dowager Deng died in 121, he asserted his authority and put a number of his trusted individuals in power to displace the late empress dowager's family, many of whom were forced to commit suicide. Among these entrusted individuals were Empress Yan's brothers Yan Xian (ÈñªÈ°Ø), Yan Jing (ÈñªÊôØ), Yan Yao (ÈñªËÄÄ), and Yan Yan (ÈñªÊôè), particularly Xian. Empress Yan herself influenced her husband in his actions greatly, much to the detriment of the empire. In 124, she falsely accused nine-year-old Prince Bao, who had been made crown prince because he was Emperor An's only son, of crimes, and Emperor An deposed Prince Bao and created him Prince of Jiyin.  As empress dowager  In 125, Emperor An died suddenly while on a trip to Wancheng (ÂÆõÂüé, in modern Nanyang, Henan). The empress, who was with him, did not immediately announce his death, but conspired with her brothers and the powerful eunuchs Jiang Jing (Ê±ü‰∫¨) and Fan Feng (Ê®äË±ê), to find an alternative to Prince Bao, who would otherwise appear to be his father's natural successor. They chose a young cousin of Emperor An's, Liu Yi (ÂäâÊáø) the Marquess of Beixiang, and Marquess Yi was made emperor over Prince Bao. (They had made this decision because the Marquess of Beixiang was young and easy to control.) The Yans, working with Jiang, quickly moved to grab more power. They falsely accused some other of Emperor An's trusted individuals‚Äîincluding his stepuncle Geng Bao (ËÄøÂØ∂), his wet nurse Wang Sheng (ÁéãËÅñ), and the eunuch Fan of crimes. Fan was executed, while Geng and Wang were exiled with their families. The Yans were firmly in power‚Äîor so they thought. A major illness to the young emperor would foil their plans. The eunuch Sun Cheng (Â≠´Á®ã), believing that Prince Bao was the proper emperor and knowing that the young emperor was ill, formed a conspiracy with Prince Bao's assistant Changxing Qu (Èï∑ËààÊ∏†) and a number of other eunuchs with intent to restore Prince Bao. When, late in the year, the young emperor died, Empress Yan and her brothers again did not announce his death but summoned the sons of the imperial princes to the capital, intending to again bypass Prince Bao. Several days later, Sun and 18 of his fellow eunuchs made a surprise attack on the palace, killing Jiang and several eunuchs in his party and forcing his colleague Li Run (ÊùéÈñè) to lead their coup d'√©tat. They welcomed Prince Bao to the palace and declared him emperor (as Emperor Shun). For several days, the eunuchs' forces battled with the empress dowager's forces, finally defeating the empress dowager and her brothers. The Yan clan was slaughtered, while Empress Dowager Yan was confined to her palace. Some officials advised Emperor Shun to depose Empress Dowager Yan from her title of empress dowager. After some consideration, Emperor Shun declined such action and continued to treat her with the honors due an empress dowager. However, perhaps in fear and in mourning for her family, she died in early 126 and was buried with her husband Emperor An.

He was the host of Diplomatic License (until its cancellation in January 2006), a weekly program that was devoted to United Nations affairs. Roth is a CNN \\"original\\" -- one of the first employees when the network launched in 1980. He has covered a wide range of stories over the last 25 years, from the 1989 Massacre in Tiananmen Square to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the first Gulf War. Biography Born to a Jewish family, Roth graduated from New York University with a degree in journalism. Roth lived in Whitestone, Queens, in the early 1970s. Before CNN, he was an news anchor and reporter for AP Radio and a producer for WPIX-TV in New York City. He is a devotee of Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest; he is alleged to have revisited the various locations shown in the film, e.g., Mount Rushmore and Cary Grant's famous cornfield sequence. In popular culture Richard Roth appeared in Robert Wiener‚Äôs book Live from Baghdad. He appeared as a character in the 2002 HBO film of the same name where he was portrayed by actor Hamish Linklater. The book as well as the film features Roth‚Äôs brief involvement with Wiener‚Äôs crew in Baghdad which was caused by sudden withdrawal of his fellow reporter colleague Tom Murphy on safety issues. Roth was stationed in Amman before joining Wiener and left the crew shortly before the Gulf War began, but within this time became part of an important coverage where the CNN team stepped into a messy US diplomatic mission in Baghdad and he interviewed a stranded US expatriate worker Robert Vinton. Roth‚Äôs interview of Vinton saw widespread coverage in the US and caused subsequent disappearance of Bob Vinton by the Iraqi authorities, though he was finally released and allowed to leave Iraq for home.

It began its service with the Soviet Army in the late 1970s, and was its first modern spin and fin stabilized heavy multiple rocket launcher. Description The BM-27 Uragan is capable of launching 220 mm rockets from 16 launch tubes mounted on the rear of a ZIL-135 8x8 chassis. This vehicle is extremely similar to that used in the FROG-7 free flight rocket system. It has two gasoline engines that power its 20 tonnes to a maximum speed of 65 kilometers per hour. One engine drives the four wheels on the left of the truck, while the other engine drives the four wheels on the right. The ZIL-135 has eight wheel drive, but only the front and rear axles are used for steering. It has a maximum cruising range of 500 kilometers. The cab of the ZIL-135 is NBC protected, allowing the rockets to be fired without exposing the crew to possible contaminants.Red Steel: Soviet Tanks and Combat Vehicles of the Cold War, by Russell Phillips, pub Shilka, 2013, p140.WeaponSystems.net, BM-27 Uragan. The six-man crew can emplace or displace the system in three minutes. Before firing, stabilizing jacks must be lowered and the blast shield raised to protect the cab and its occupants. Indirect fire aiming is achieved with the use of a PG-1 panoramic telescope. Although there are no night vision sights, the driver of the launch vehicle is equipped with a night vision device. The BM-27 can use HE-FRAG, chemical, explosive or scatterable mine (PTM-3 or PFM-1) submunition equipped rockets, all of which are detonated by electric timing fuses. Each rocket weighs 280.4 kilograms. The warheads weigh between 90 and 100 kilograms, depending on type. A full salvo of 16 rockets can be fired in 20 seconds and can engage targets within a range of 35 kilometers. Because of the size of the warhead, the range of the rocket and the speed that a salvo can be delivered, the BM-27 is very effective at mine laying. Each 220 mm rocket can scatter 312 anti-personnel PFM-1 mines. Minefields can be laid behind a retreating enemy or even be used to trap an enemy by encircling them with mines. Tactics such as this were often used by the Soviets in Afghanistan. Once the rockets have been fired, 9T452 (another ZIL-135 based vehicle) is used to assist in reloading. It carries additional rockets and a crane to transfer the rockets from the reload vehicle to the launcher. The entire reloading procedure takes around 20 minutes. { The 9P140 missile launcher vehicle as a monument to A.N.

Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) =Description= The Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) was approved by the Kuwait Council of Ministers for award in five classes, generally according to the rank of the recipient. The medal was offered by the Chief of Staff of the Kuwait Armed Forces on July 16, 1994. A nation of seafarers and ship builders, Kuwait chose as their coat of arms, the traditional dhow. Falconry is the sport of Kings in the Persian Gulf, and the falcon in the arms is seen as a symbol of Kuwaiti prowess. The official symbolism of the colors is that black symbolizes battlefields, white is for deeds, green is for the meadows, and red is for the blood of Kuwait's enemies. ; Fifth Class *Medal: A Bronze medal with enamel, 1 9/16 inches (40 mm) in diameter suspended from a bar by a wreath. The obverse bears the coat of arms of the State of Kuwait. The Coat of Arms consists of the shield of the flag design in color superimposed on a falcon with wings displayed. The falcon supports a disk containing a sailing ship with the full name of the State written at the top of the disk. At the top of the medal is the inscription \\"1991 LIBERATION MEDAL\\" in Arabic letters. The reverse side is the map of Kuwait on a rayed background. *Ribbon: The ribbon is the pattern of the flag of the State of Kuwait and consists of three equal stripes 29/64 inch (11.5 mm) each of the following colors: Old Glory Red 67156; White 67101; and Irish Green 67189. A black trapezium is at the top of the ribbon drape and service ribbon. * Intended for non-commissioned personnel. ; Fourth Class * A dull grey metal medal, suspended from a bar engraved with laurel leaves. The obverse bears a fully sized, five pointed star over a pattern of engraved rays with the centre containing the same falcon and dhow emblem as the fifth class medal and the reverse the same map and rayed background. * Intended for warrant and junior commissioned officers. ; Third Class * A bright gilt medal of similar design to the fourth class medal. The points of the star are considerably rounded and, instead of the rayed background, the medal is pierced between the star and the outer circle. * Intended for field-grade and equivalent officers. ; Second Class * Medal: A golden star overlaying a laurel wreath. The centre emblem is significantly smaller than for the lower classes of medal. There is Arabic writing above and below the centre emblem. The star is suspended directly from the ribbon, by a ring attached to the wreath. * Ribbon: Of identical pattern to the ribbons for the lower orders, this now bears a miniature of the centre emblem in gold- coloured metal and enamel. * Intended for one and two star officers. ; First Class * Medal: A neck decoration of large pattern. Similar to the second class medal but the star is enamelled in with red points and a white circle surrounding the centre emblem. The white circle contains a geometric outer pattern in gold and Arabic writing above the centre. Pierced rays, of differing lengths, lie behind the wreath. The star is suspended from its high point. * Ribbon: Similar to that for the lower awards but double ended. No miniature emblem. * Intended for three and four star officers. Australia The Australian government has decreed that its military personnel may accept their medals as a keepsake, but permission to wear them in uniform has so far been refused. This is because the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) was approved to wear in uniform prior to the Kuwait issued medal being issued. It was potentially due to a clerical error within the Australian government that medals were issued to serving personnel who had not participated in eligible operations, due to crew change-outs on participating ships. Canada The Canadian government has decreed that its military personnel may accept their medals as a keepsake, but permission to wear them in uniform has so far been refused. Four Canadians were permitted by the government of Canada to wear their medals. France France accepted all grades version for their personnel according to their rank at the time of Operation Desert Storm, permission to wear them in uniform has been granted. United Kingdom The UK's government has decreed that its military personnel may accept their medals as a keepsake but that due to the fact that a UK-created campaign medal, the Gulf Medal, has already been issued, permission to wear the medal or ribbon was denied. United States The US accepted only the fifth grade version for all eligible personnel. Criteria: Awarded to members of the Military Coalition who served in support of Operation Desert Shield or Desert Storm in one or more of the following areas between 2 August 1990 and 31 August 1993: Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden, that portion of the Arabian Sea that lies north of 10 degrees north latitude and west of 68 degrees east longitude, as well as the total land areas of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. To be eligible, a service member must have been:Air Force Personnel Center Kuwait Liberation Medal--Kuwait :(1) attached to or regularly serving for one or more days with an organization participating in ground/shore (military) operations; :(2) attached to or regularly serving for one or more days aboard a naval vessel directly supporting military operations; :(3) actually participating as a crew member in one or more aerial flights directly supporting military operations in the areas designated above; :(4) serving on temporary duty for 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days. These time limitations may be waived for members participating in actual combat operations. The government of Kuwait offered the Kuwait Liberation Medal to members of the Armed Forces of the United States by letter dated 16 July 1994. The medal was accepted by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry per memorandum dated 16 March 1995.

The bunker was constructed in total secrecy in 1939 but only rarely used during the war, with only two meetings of the War Cabinet being held there. It was abandoned in 1944.Subterranea Britannica It comprises some forty rooms on two floors, is semi-derelict with original equipment abandoned and rusted, and a certain amount of water ingress which is kept at bay by an electric extraction pump. Paddock was used after World War II by the Post Office for research and development and by the Post Office Research Laboratories Sports and Social Club. Paddock lay unused from when the Post Office moved to Martlesham Heath (Suffolk) and vacated the site in 1976 until Network Homes purchased the site (including Paddock) in 1997. The bunker is owned by Network Homes, an affordable housing association which is responsible for the properties now occupying part of the former research station site above, and used to be open to the public two or three times a year, with free guided tours provided by volunteers from the Subterranea Britannica organisation.

Features The critic James V. Mirollo, the author of the first monograph in English on the subject, distinguished the terms as follows:James V. Mirollo. The Poet of the Marvelous. Columbia University Press, New York, 1963. :Marinismo first appeared in the last [19th] century as a label for the themes and techniques of Marino and his followers. It continues to be used synonymously with secentismo and concettismo, although the former has more pejorative connotations as well as wider cultural implications, while the latter embraces the European practice of the witty style. Marinista and Marinisti go back to the seicento [17th century]: Stigliani [a detractor] refers [in 1627] to Marino's followers as i Marinisti (Occhiale, p.516). Elsewhere (Epist., II, p. 304) he speaks of la trama marinesca (the Marinesque intrigue). The following discussion is based on Mirollo's analysis. =Themes= *\\"The activities of a Petrarchan lady who is designated simply as Donna or given the name Lilla.\\" The lady is impossible, inaccessible, cruel, and yet fully occupied with walks, rides, games, and tourism, all of which Marino describes and comments on at length. \\"To sum up, the poet favored material dealing with (1) the domestic and social activities of the beloved lady and any odd features of her appearance; (2) the variety of disguises under which she might be found, from socialite to sea nymph; (3) the talent or renown of famous women living at the time.\\" The famous women include the Princess of Stigliano, Signora N. Biscia, Signora V. Spinola, and others. *\\"Subjects that allow the poet to develop fully and richly the motif of sensual delight.\\" This ranges from fantasies about kissing the beloved, to actual kissing, through to the sexual act itself. *\\"Curious and bizarre subjects, sometimes bordering on the grotesque and ugly [...] capricci.\\" =Ornament= *\\"Latinate inversion and displacement,\\" which is used not for obfuscation but to place the vital elements of each sentence in prominent positions, either at the beginning of every couplet, or at the end of a stanza. *Non-standard syntax of various kinds, separating nouns from their adjectives, or putting a subject after its verb. *Doubling and tripling, \\"when two words are similar but contribute to a single idea.\\" *Chiasmus and antithesis. *Repetition of words, and echo effects. *\\"Alliteration, assonance, and consonant.\\" =Similitude and metaphor= The Marinist poet never hesitated to embark on a long string of comparisons with nature, most of them couched as metaphor rather than simile because this allowed for more striking statements. \\"There was hardly an area of human experience that could not be pressed into service for a comparison.\\" Nevertheless, Marino leans heavily on both classical mythology and Christian imagery, adapting it freely to create a huge number of memorable word-pictures: \\"gems, minerals, and precious metals [...] flowers (especially the rose and the lily), birds, fire, snow, the seasons, the sea, and, above all, sun and stars [...] milk, ivory, parturition, the arts and sciences, and a variety of actions and emotions useful for personification.\\" See also * List of Marinist poets * Culteranismo * Euphuism * Pr√©cieuses * Massimo Colella, Separatezza e conversazione.

Unlike Kitay-gorod which was purpose-built as a cross-platform interchange station, Tretyakovskaya operated as a normal station before the connection with Kalininskaya Line in 1986. At that time a second hall was opened forming a cross-platform interchange. The two halls are joined by a passage located midway along their length and also by the shared vestibule, which opens onto Klimentovsky Lane. The southern hall of Tretyakovskaya opened on 3 January 1971. Designed by V. Polikarpova and A. Marova, it has block pylons faced with white Koyelga marble and joined by a continuous marble cornice. Kaluzhsko- Rizhskaya Line trains stopped at both platforms of this hall until 1986, when the new northern hall opened. Currently the southern hall is served by northbound trains of both lines, terminating at Medvedkovo and Novokosino. The northern hall, served by southbound trains terminating at Tretyakovskaya and Novoyasenevskaya, was designed by R. Pogrebnoy and V. Filippov.

Such involutions are easy to characterize and they can be described geometrically. Linear involutions To give a linear involution is the same as giving an involutory matrix, a square matrix A such that :A^2=I quadquadquadquad (1) where I is the identity matrix. It is a quick check that a square matrix D whose elements are all zero off the main diagonal and ¬±1 on the diagonal, that is, a signature matrix of the form :D=begin{pmatrix} pm 1 & 0 & cdots & 0 & 0  0 & pm 1 & cdots & 0 & 0  vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots  0 & 0 & cdots & pm 1 & 0  0 & 0 & cdots & 0 & pm 1 end{pmatrix} satisfies (1), i.e. is the matrix of a linear involution. It turns out that all the matrices satisfying (1) are of the form :A=U ‚àí1DU, where U is invertible and D is as above. That is to say, the matrix of any linear involution is of the form D up to a matrix similarity. Geometrically this means that any linear involution can be obtained by taking oblique reflections against any number from 0 through n hyperplanes going through the origin. (The term oblique reflection as used here includes ordinary reflections.) One can easily verify that A represents a linear involution if and only if A has the form :A = ¬±(2P - I) for a linear projection P. Affine involutions If A represents a linear involution, then x‚ÜíA(x‚àíb)+b is an affine involution. One can check that any affine involution in fact has this form. Geometrically this means that any affine involution can be obtained by taking oblique reflections against any number from 0 through n hyperplanes going through a point b. Affine involutions can be categorized by the dimension of the affine space of fixed points; this corresponds to the number of values 1 on the diagonal of the similar matrix D (see above), i.e., the dimension of the eigenspace for eigenvalue 1. The affine involutions in 3D are: * the identity * the oblique reflection in respect to a plane * the oblique reflection in respect to a line * the reflection in respect to a point. Isometric involutions In the case that the eigenspace for eigenvalue 1 is the orthogonal complement of that for eigenvalue ‚àí1, i.e., every eigenvector with eigenvalue 1 is orthogonal to every eigenvector with eigenvalue ‚àí1, such an affine involution is an isometry. The two extreme cases for which this always applies are the identity function and inversion in a point. The other involutive isometries are inversion in a line (in 2D, 3D, and up; this is in 2D a reflection, and in 3D a rotation about the line by 180¬∞), inversion in a plane (in 3D and up; in 3D this is a reflection in a plane), inversion in a 3D space (in 3D: the identity), etc. Affine geometry ","title":"Affine involution"},{"id":"2858812","text":"Stuart LeRoy Thayer (March 27, 1926 ‚Äì June 24, 2009) was a historian of American circuses. Biography He was born on March 27, 1926 in Ann Arbor, Michigan to Louise and Lyle O. Thayer (1901-1968). Thayer served in World War II after which he graduated with a degree in literature from the University of Michigan. He operated an insurance agency in Ann Arbor until his late 40s, when he retired to devote the remainder of his life to documenting the history of the American circus. He began writing articles on circus history in Bandwagon, the journal of the Circus Historical Society, in the late 1960s, one a piece on Ringling cages co-authored by Richard Conover, then the leading student of American field shows. His first major work was Mudshows and Railers, an account of the 1879 circus season based mainly on a close reading of the New York Clipper, the industry's trade paper, and metropolitan dailies. The first of his three groundbreaking books on the history of the American Circus before 1860, Annals of the American Circus, came out in 1976. It was the first extensively researched, comprehensive account of the ante-bellum American circus, obsoleting virtually all previous secondary work on the subject. He later co-authored books with fellow historians Fred Dahlinger and William L. Slout, and continued to publish in Bandwagon. Traveling Showmen, his masterpiece, was published in 1997. The distillation of his thirty years of research, the book analyzed the economic and operational aspects of pre- Civil War circuses. A companion volume on the performance and performers appeared in 2006. At the time of his death, he was finishing a biography of Adam Forepaugh, the late 19th century circus manager. Thayer died in Seattle, Washington on June 24, 2009.

The choreography incorporates an apparatus that is often attached to the ceiling, allowing performers to explore space in three dimensions. The ability to incorporate vertical, as well as horizontal movement paths, allows for innovations in choreography and movement. Overview There are two types of aerial dance. In vertical dance a dancer is suspended in a harness from a rope or cable and explores the difference in gravity, weightlessness and varied movement possibilities offered by the suspended state. In the second type a dancer or acrobat intertwines the use of the floor or a wall with their aerial apparatus. The first utilizes the strength and expression of dance with an altered state to communicate contemporary ideas. In the second, the dancer uses dance as a way to indicate that their work is less trick-based than circus arts, and in some cases hopes that disassociating with the circus makes their work appear more contemporary and artistic. One of the first choreographers to utilize what we now think of as aerial dance was Trisha Brown. She called her dances (1968‚Äì1971) \\"equipment pieces\\". Please see the video of a reproduction of one of her early pieces. They are not ‚Äúdancey‚Äù pieces, but by placing the pedestrians on the side wall, Brown illustrates the choreography of everyday movement. She was notably the first choreographer to pull dancers up into the air. She choreographed multiple pieces off the ground, some involving projection and multimedia, using air and wall surfaces in novel ways. In the late '90s an Argentinian aerial dance troupe named De La Guarda gained notoriety in London for their show combining performance art with aerial dance. The troupe is no longer touring, but some previous members have started a new company called Cuerda Producciones that continues to create aerial dance theater pieces. Wanda Moretti of Italy is creating a vertical dance network aimed at collecting knowledge for artists and professionals in the field. Moretti says, ‚ÄúFrom its beginning 30 years ago, vertical dance evolved from the multiple practices and influences of its initial instigators. It was born from the desire to explore space, environment and become a place where everything was possible.‚Äù Aerial modern pieces, whether solo or ensemble, often involve partnering. The apparatus used has its own motion, which changes the way a dancer must move in response. The introduction of a new element changes the dancer‚Äôs balance, center, and orientation in space. Aerial modern dancers gather annually for workshops in Boulder, Colorado, County Donegal in Ireland, Brittany, in France, and Italy. Another early influence on aerial modern dance, Terry Sendgraff, is credited with inventing the \\"motivity\\" trapeze. Sendgraff actively performed, choreographed and taught in the San Francisco Bay Area from the early 1970s, until announcing her retirement in 2005 at the age of 70, when she handed over her aerial dance business to Cherie Carson. The motivity trapeze came about as a result of an exploration on a low-hung circus trapeze. The ropes twisted together, causing the apparatus to spin. By formalizing this, hooking both ropes to a single point of attachment, Ms. Sendgraff used the apparatus to spin, twist, as well as fly in a straight line and in a circle.  Workshops  In Boulder, Frequent Flyers Productions produces the Aerial Dance Festival which been held every year since its inception in July 1999. Here workshops, performances, and discussions bring together dancers, gymnasts, circus artin Brighton, England every summer. In Italy, an emerging aerial dance company, brought the contemporary dance discipline to a vertical stage. The performance of the Company is distinguished from others by the details of the choreography and the harmony of the movement, typical elements of classic dance. Aerial dance is an art form that is incredibly demanding and requires a high degree of strength, power, flexibility, courage, and grace to practice. Site dance Site Specific Aerial Dance Vertical Dance Performance Other examples of aerial modern dance are the site-specific works of Joanna Haigood of the Zaccho Dance Theatre, Amelia Rudolph of \\"Project Bandaloop,\\" and Sally Jacques' Blue Lapis Light. Haigood‚Äôs work is based on careful research of the history, architecture and societal impact of found spaces, and the translation of these memories into the movements performed in that space.Zaccho Dance Theatre web site - Artistic Directory Joanna Haigood Project Bandaloop combines rock- climbing with dance in performances that scale and/or descend canyons, rock walls, and tall buildings across the world. Video of their outdoor work is sometimes integrated into indoor performances, projected onto screens or trampolines behind the dancers on stage. Blue Lapis Light uses multiple apparatuses, such as aerial silks, harnesses, and bungees to create dances on bridges, office buildings, hotels, and other outdoor spaces.

Life Labat was born and died in Paris. He entered the order of the Dominicans at the age of twenty. He was ordained at the completion of his philosophical and theological studies. Besides preaching, he taught philosophy and mathematics to secular students at Nancy. Abandoning this work, he devoted himself to missionary activity and for many years preached in the various churches of France. In 1693, determined to devote himself to foreign missionary work, he received permission from the general of his order to travel to the West Indies, then under French domination. On 29 January 1694, he landed in Martinique. He was entrusted with the parish of Macouba (Macumba), where he labored for two years and added many new buildings, including the church. In 1696 he travelled to Guadeloupe, and was appointed procurator-general of all the Dominican convents in the Antilles (Procureur syndic des √Æles d'Am√©rique) upon his return to Martinique. The French government appointed him as an engineer due to his scientific knowledge. In this capacity, he visited the French, Dutch, and English Antilles from Grenada to Hispaniola. Labat encountered many aspects of Caribbean society, including slavery. In his account for the year 1698, Labat included his impressions regarding the slaves of Martinique: \\"The dance is their favourite passion. I don't think that there is a people on the face of the earth who are more attached to it than they. When the Master will not allow them to dance on the Estate, they will travel three and four leagues, as soon as they knock off work at the sugar-works on Saturday, and betake themselves to some place where they know that there will be a dance.\\" Labat was no simple observer of slavery, however. As proprietor of the estate of Fonds-Saint-Jacques (in the north, alongside a river of the same name) and founder of the parish of Fran√ßois, both on Martinique, Labat applied himself to modernizing and developing the sugar industry on this island, and owned -and brutalized- his own slaves.Aur√©lia Montel, Le P√®re Labat viendra te prendre‚Ä¶ (Paris: Maisonneuve et Larose, 1996), 37 Fonds-Saint-Jacques was for a long time regarded as a model to be copied. On Martinique, Labat's memory has survived in the vocabulary: La Tour du p√®re Labat (\\"windmill\\"); les chaudi√®res P√®re Labat (the P√®re Labat boilers\\"), or the standard of distillation known as type P√®re Labat. As engineer in Guadeloupe, he took an active part in its defense when the British attacked the island in 1703. Labat fired several cannon with his own hand. He was appointed Vice-Pr√©fet Apostolique in the same year. In 1706, Labat was sent to Europe as deputy of his order. He spent several years in Italy and attended a meeting of the order at Bologna, and presenting to the general a report of his work. Labat prepared to return to America, but was denied permission and detained in Rome for several years. He traveled to Paris in 1716. He lived in the convent on Rue Saint-Honore until his death. During these years, Labat commenced a long contemplated history of the West Indies. The work was finally published in six volumes at Paris, in 1722, with copious illustrations made by himself (Nouveau Voyage aux isles Fran√ßoises de l'Am√©rique, Paris, 1722). Legacy *On Martinique, Labat devised new methods for the manufacture of sugar, which remained in use for a long time. *Labat had a wide reputation as a mathematician and won recognition both as a naturalist and as a scientist. He assisted the botanist Charles Plumier in his work, while Plumier was in the West Indies. He embodied in the history his scientific observations and treated comprehensively and accurately of the soil, trees, plants, fruits, and herbs of the islands. He also explained the manufactures then in existence and pointed out means for the development of commercial relations. *His books that deal with America, \\"best-sellers\\" during their time, are Nouveau voyage aux iles de l'Amerique (6 vols., Paris, 1722; 2d ed., 8 vols., 1742; Dutch translation, 4 vols., Amsterdam, 1725; German, 6 vols., Nuremberg, 1783-'7); and Voyage du Chevalier Demarchais en Guinee, iles voisines, et a Cayenne, fait en 1725, 1726, et 1727 (4 vols., Paris, 1730). *He published similar works on other countries, drawing information from the notes of other missionaries. His two works on Africa have become well known: Nouvelle relation de l'Afrique occidentale (Paris, 1728) and Relation historique de l'Ethiopie occidentale (Congo, Angola, Matamba, after the Italian of Father Cavazzi, Cap. (Paris, 1732). The genus of the tropical fruit tree family Sapotaceae Labatia, first described in 1788, was named after Labat. It was maintained as a distinct entity until the 1930s when it was submerged in the genus Pouteria. In 1972, it was proposed that a new genus called Neolabatia be recognized, containing six species formerly known as Labatia, but this classification is disputed.

The song was written by McCartney and Harrison and is the only song to credit the two alone. Recording took place sometime between May and July 1958 at Percy Phillips' home studio in Liverpool. Recording costs were likely 17 shillings and six pence. Composition Along with their cover of Buddy Holly's \\"That'll Be the Day\\" recorded at the same session, these songs were the first recordings made by what would become the Beatles. The only other previous recording of the Quarrymen in performance was a reel-to-reel tape-recording made by an audience member on 6 July 1957, during the Quarrymen's last set for the 1957 Rose Queen garden f√™te at St. Peter's Church, Woolton, Liverpool. This was made on the very day on which McCartney first met Lennon, but before he was a member of the group. McCartney has claimed to have written the song: \\"'In Spite of All The Danger' was actually written by me and George played the guitar solo! We were mates and nobody was into copyrights and publishing, nobody understood ‚Äì we actually used to think when we came down to London that songs belonged to everyone.... I remember we all went down on the bus with our instruments ‚Äì amps and guitars ‚Äì and the drummer went separately. We waited in the little waiting room outside while somebody else made their demo and then it was our turn. We just went into the room, hardly saw the fella because he was next door in a little control booth. \\"OK, what are you going to do?\\" We ran through it very quickly, quarter of an hour, and it was all over. I think we paid ¬£5 for that. It was me, John, George, Colin Hanton on drums and Duff Lowe, five of us ... I sang the lead, I think so anyway. It was my song. It's very similar to an Elvis song. It's me doing an Elvis ... I'm a bit loath to say which! ... It was one that I'd heard at scout camp when I was younger and I'd loved it.\\" Most commentators conclude that the Presley song used by McCartney as a model was \\"Tryin' to Get to You\\", which was included in Elvis's first UK album, back in 1956, and which includes the line \\"In spite of all that I've been through.\\" Chris Ingram says it was \\"clearly inspired\\" by it, and John C. Winn says it was \\"fashioned after\\" it. Musical structure The song is in the key of E and follows a standard I (E chord)-I7-IV (A chord)-V7 (B7 chord)-I-IV-I progression. Here the harmonic development initially arises with the move (in bar 5 on \\"I'll do anything for you\\") to a subdominant or IV (A chord built on the 4th degree of the E major scale), but without the intervening range of chords prolonging harmonic tension that so characterised later Beatles songwriting. The resolution back to the tonic comes as the V chord (B7 in bar 8 on \\"you want me to\\") shifts to the I (E chord on \\"true to me\\"). History of the recording The tape recording was erased after transfer to a 10-inch acetate disc. Only one copy of the \\"That'll Be the Day\\" and \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\" recordings was made, and each band member kept the acetate for a week. Lowe was the last to have it, keeping it for nearly 25 years. In 1981, Lowe attempted to sell it at auction, but McCartney intervened and purchased it from him. McCartney had engineers restore as much of the record's sound quality as possible and then made approximately 50 copies of the single that he gave as personal gifts to family and friends. In 2004, Record Collector magazine named the original pressing the most valuable record in existence, estimating its worth at ¬£100,000, with the 1981 copies made by McCartney coming in second on the list at ¬£10,000 each. Public release \\"In Spite of All the Danger\\" was not released to the public until it appeared on 1995's Anthology 1 collection along with \\"That'll Be the Day.\\" Live performances McCartney played the song throughout his 2004 Summer and 2005 US tours and would continue to perform it through his 2016‚Äì17 One on One and 2018 Freshen Up tours. In film The song's recording was depicted by The Nowhere Boys in the 2009 biopic Nowhere Boy which was accurate even to the 17/6d charge for the recording session. The band also perform \\"That'll Be the Day,\\" although it was cut out of the film and is available as a deleted scene on the DVD and Blu-ray releases. These versions of the two songs can be heard on the film's soundtrack.

It is the historic home of, and is synonymous with, the Hawthorn Football Club, who played there from 1903 and as a VFL/AFL club from 1925‚Äì1973, and retained the ground as an administrative and training base until 2006. Hawthorn moved to a redeveloped Waverley Park early in 2006 in preparation for the 2006 AFL season. History Prior to adopting Glenferrie Oval as the club's traditional home, the Hawthorn Football Club had a nomadic history, playing home games at whatever the most suitable obtainable ground was for that season. Their first home ground was the Hawthorn C.G. (West Hawthorn Reserve), which was abandoned after just 1 season due to conditions imposed by the Hawthorn Cricket Club, with the Hawks playing at John Wren's Richmond Racecourse in 1903 (which was off Bridge Road between Stawell Street and Westbank Terrace ‚Äì where Tudor Street with 5 no through streets branches of are now located), before moving to the Richmond Cricket Ground in 1904. The Hawk's merger with Boroondara in 1905 had them move to Boroondara's ground, which at the time was the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hawthorn dropped their colours of blue and red (similar to Melbourne's guernsey at the time) and adopted Boroondara's colours, which was a black guernsey with red sash but retained the name Hawthorn FC. When the Hawthorn council opened Glenferrie Oval, then known as the Hawthorn City Sports Ground in October 1905, they endeavored to get a senior club to represent the district to be the main tenant during the next football season. The Hawthorn FC, competing in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (now known as the VAFA), and Hawthorn Rovers (a popular club in the Eastern Suburbs Association) merged to form the Hawthorn City Football Club and made Glenferrie their home ground (the word City was later dropped and the club was just known as the Hawthorn Football Club when it entered the VFA in 1914) . Between 1906 and 1973, the Hawks played their home games at Glenferrie Oval, which was located in the heart of the affluent suburb of Hawthorn. The state of Glenferrie Oval and its location, close by the Glenferrie train station on the Melbourne East route, was a central reason why the club was firstly accepted into the VFA in 1914, and then the VFL in 1925. The club's onfield results had not reached any great heights in those early days but both the VFA and VFL had recognised the importance for representation in the suburbs east of the Yarra River. Glenferrie Oval was pivotal in these advancements of the Hawthorn Football Club as it was considered the most suitable at the time. In 1914, when Hawthorn entered the VFA, the council was required to build a new dressing shed to meet the standards of the VFA competition. These dressing sheds were erected in the north-west corner of the ground, where the Tuck Stand now resides, and were later moved to the Rathmines Road Reserve in Hawthorn where it still exists today. In 1922 the ground was widened by 30 yards and lengthened westward by 50 yards - taking in the previous outer reserve ground - to the dimensions that remain today. The 1922 ground improvements also resulted in Glenferrie Oval's first main stand, which was a wooden structure to be known as the Kennon-Owen Stand, and had been purchased from the East Melbourne Cricket Ground in late 1921 when that ground was closed due to expansion of the Jolimont railyards. The Kennon-Owen Stand was replaced by the Dr A S Ferguson Stand, a new brick stand opened in 1966 which was 185 feet long and could seat 1450, with 400 undercover. It was later to be home of the Past Players Association and the original Museum. The northern part of the Ferguson stand was demolished to make way for the Victorian Weightlifting Building that remain today. Glenferrie Oval's grandstand, designed in an art-deco style, was built in 1937 and later named the Michael Tuck stand after the club great, and housed the new changerooms and administration of the club. It is now heritage protected as one of the most significant buildings of the era. In 1963 the large scoreboard was erected at the eastern end of the ground. After the club won the 1961 premiership it was decided to buy some houses on the other side of Linda Crescent to build the Social Club which opened in 1962. The ground was relatively small by VFL standards, but the intimate nature of the ground (with the grandstands and train line surrounding the ground) made for a terrific atmosphere. The Hawks had played 584 matches at Glenferrie Oval during their time there. The last game that Hawthorn played at Glenferrie Oval was in August 1973 when Hawthorn won against South Melbourne by 37 points, in front of a crowd of 9842 people. The ground The location of the ground has always been expansion prohibitive, wedged between the Belgrave/Lilydale railway line and nearby side streets. The small size and narrow wings of the ground led to it being known as the \\"sardine can\\" amongst fans.Connolly, Paul. \\"The Last Stand\\" The Age The (Melbourne) Magazine #19, May 2006 The ground includes: * the heritage registered art deco Michael Tuck Stand (1938), named after Hawthorn legend Michael Tuck. * the Ferguson Stand (1960s) * the Victorian Weightlifting Stadium * the social club (1963), sold by the Hawthorn Football Club in 2008 and subsequently demolished. Present day The ground is open to the general public, and is used for a variety of recreation and leisure activities. In March 2010 the playing field was resurfaced with couch grass for public use.

Background  The Saudi Arabian version of the Kuwait Liberation Medal is awarded to members of the Coalition Forces who participated in Operation Desert Storm and the liberation of Kuwait between the dates of January 17, 1991 and February 28, 1991. It is considered rarer than the Kuwaiti version of the medal, because it recognizes service in a relatively short period of time (only a few weeks) whereas the Kuwaiti version of the medal is granted for service over three years. The Saudi Arabian version is also senior in U.S. precedence, owing to its having been authorized for several years before the Kuwaiti version was offered.  Description  The Saudi version of the Kuwait Liberation Medal consists of a silver star of fifteen rounded points (with shorter rounded points between them) surmounted by a gilt medallion which contains a wreath tied at its base and a crown at its top. In the center of the gilt medallion is a silver representation of the Earth, over which is superimposed a gilt representation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Above the gilt medallion are the crossed swords and palm tree taken from the Royal Cypher. Beneath the gilt medallion is a swallow-tailed scroll with its ends folded back and point upward so they follow the contour of the gilt medallion. On the scroll are the words, LIBERATION OF KUWAIT in English, and the same inscription above it in Arabic. = Ribbon device = The service ribbon for the Kuwait Liberation Medal bears a gold-gilt device consisting of crossed swords (point up) superimposed over a palm tree.

This finding led to an important debate regarding the scope of section 24(1) of the Charter, which provides for remedies for those whose rights are infringed, and the applicability of the common law doctrine of functus officio. While the Supreme Court of Canada split on what constitutes an appropriate usage of section 24(1), the majority favoured a section 24(1) with broad, flexible capabilities. Background According to the Supreme Court of Canada, Nova Scotia's past had not been marked by a great deal of governmental action for providing education in French. After 1982, however, section 23 was added to the Constitution of Canada, thus creating a right for Francophone and Acadian Nova Scotians to schooling in their own language, provided that they were of a sufficient number. Several Francophone families in five school districts, Kingston/Greenwood, Ch√©ticamp, √éle Madame-Arichat (Petit-de-Grat), Argyle, and Clare, tried to invoke that right, requesting new buildings or programs for primary and secondary education, and the provincial government responded with affirmation that section 23 did indeed mandate that this request be fulfilled. This affirmation was, however, followed by delay, and in 1998, with no schools having been built, the minority language community turned to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to move the government to meet its obligation. The court heard the case in October 1999. The court was led by Justice LeBlanc, who found that section 23 required new schools and programs for the families. Moreover, he ruled that the delay in construction also constituted an infringement of the claimants' section 23 rights. He reached the latter conclusion by pointing out that French language Nova Scotians were increasingly being absorbed into the English-language community. Hence, any further delay would eventually jeopardize the existence of the French community. Since the French community's requests were also anchored on a constitutional principle, they also deserved priority. Accordingly, LeBlanc used section 24(1) of the Charter to set deadlines and demand that the government report to him as construction progressed. The obligation of the provincial government to report to Justice LeBlanc was disputed, as it was considered a violation of functus officio, in which a judge makes a ruling and afterwards has no authority. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal sided with the government and overturned the requirement of reporting, citing concerns about moving Canada towards United States-style injunctions and upsetting the relationship between the Canadian court system and the government. The argument that section 23 gave the claimants a right to French programs and schools, however, was not questioned. Decision While construction had been completed by the time the minority language families appealed their case to the Supreme Court of Canada, Justices Frank Iacobucci and Louise Arbour, writing for the majority of the Court, declined to set aside the case for mootness. They went on to vindicate the position of Justice LeBlanc and overturn the Court of Appeal. =Section 23= The majority of the Supreme Court approved the creative method for enforcing section 23 partly by emphasizing the importance of section 23 and how it was always meant to be an enforceable right. Section 23, they wrote, has a \\"remedial nature... designed to correct past injustices not only by halting the progressive erosion of minority official language cultures across Canada, but also by actively promoting their flourishing.\\" Hence, section 23 is a positive right requiring government action. =Section 24= Regarding section 24, the majority cited past Charter cases such as R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd. (1986), Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act (1985), and Vriend v. Alberta (1998) to point out that the courts have approached the Charter with a \\"generous and expansive interpretation and not a narrow, technical, or legalistic one.\\" This style of interpretation, the majority felt, was just as applicable for remedies as rights, and they observed the broad wording of section 24(1), which merely dictates that the court will award a \\"remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.\\" Since section 23 must be enforced, section 24(1) must be \\"responsive\\" to an infringement of the right, and since section 24(1) is itself an important part of the Charter, the remedy must be \\"effective.\\" While judicial restraint is important, it is limited by the obligation of the Court to enforce constitutional rights. The circumstances, which included the threat that the French language would eventually disappear, were judged to require a remedy that would ensure the right would be met in a reasonable amount of time. The section 24(1) phrase limiting remedies, requiring that they be \\"appropriate and just in the circumstances\\", was defined partly as giving the courts themselves the right to determine what was appropriate and just, although judges should be aware of doctrines such as functus officio. The Supreme Court also defined an \\"appropriate and just remedy,\\" as being one that upholds the right, including with regard to circumstances. It is also appropriate and just to remember that as part of the constitution, and with broad wording, section 24 can \\"evolve to meet the challenges and circumstances of those cases\\" and can have \\"novel and creative features.\\" The Court should avoid taking functions it could not hold and should be fair to the government, but in this case hearing reports was judged to allow the court to exercise its constitutional function to enforce rights. In addition, the court would not \\"improperly take over the detailed management and co-ordination of the construction projects.\\" With regard to functus officio, the Court ruled that this common law principle cannot invalidate section 24, although it is an important consideration. The Court ultimately concluded functus officio was not violated because the reports did not \\"alter a final judgment.\\" While LeBlanc could see reports, he could not change his decision to further define section 23. Dissent The justices who did not side with Iacobucci and Arbour did not dispute the applicability or importance of section 23. Instead, a dissent regarding the usage of section 24(1) was written by Justices Louis LeBel and Marie Deschamps. They justified their dissent on the grounds that in order for the courts to \\"avoid turning themselves into managers of the public service... Judicial interventions should end when and where the case of which a judge is seized is brought to a close.\\" In their view, Justice LeBlanc seeing reports amounted to overseeing the construction, which violated functus officio and the separation of powers, which could, in turn, threaten judicial independence. The dissenting justices also felt Justice LeBlanc had an option not to require reports, and section 23 still could have been enforced. Justice LeBlanc's expectations, moreover, were not judged to be clear enough to the government. Fundamental justice was thus seen as having been violated. The majority responded to these concerns by arguing that \\"the approach taken by... LeBel and Deschamps JJ. which appears to contemplate that special remedies might be available in some circumstances, but not in this case, severely undervalues the importance and the urgency of the language rights in the context facing LeBlanc J.\\" External links The Canadian Legal Information Institute's overview of section 24(1) case law, which includes highlights of Doucet-Boudreau * Fundamental Freedoms: The Charter of Rights and Freedoms - Charter of Rights website with video, audio and the Charter in over 20 languages Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms case law Supreme Court of Canada cases 2003 in Canadian case law Nova Scotia law ","title":"Doucet-Boudreau v Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)"},{"id":"2858876","text":"Queen Elizabeth II Court Regina City Council is the governing body of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.

It was recorded on 3 June 1964 but remained unreleased until its inclusion on the band's 1995 outtakes compilation Anthology 1.  Background  During a photographic assignment on the morning of 3 June 1964, Ringo Starr was taken ill with tonsillitis and pharyngitis, 24 hours before the Beatles were due to leave for a six-country tour. The recording session booked for that day was originally intended to produce a fourteenth song for the band's A Hard Day's Night album, but this activity was cancelled so that a replacement drummer, Jimmie Nicol, could be brought in and rehearse with the group. After running through six songs in a one-hour rehearsal in EMI's Studio Two, everyone felt satisfied with Nicol's drumming, so he left to pack his suitcase. That evening, in a four-hour session in Studio Two, each of the three present Beatles recorded a demo of a newly written song. Harrison recorded \\"You Know What to Do\\"; John Lennon did \\"No Reply\\", which eventually ended up as the opening track of their next album, Beatles for Sale; and Paul McCartney did \\"It's for You\\", a song which was written specifically for Cilla Black to sing. The tape of the session was subsequently misfiled, but was rediscovered in 1993. Harrison's first contribution to the Beatles' output was \\"Don't Bother Me\\", recorded in September 1963. His next contribution was not until \\"I Need You\\", recorded in February 1965. Asked about this gap in 1965, George Martin said that Harrison \\"got discouraged some time ago when none of us liked something that he had written\\". According to music critic Richie Unterberger, Martin was most likely referring to \\"You Know What to Do\\".  Musical structure  The song is in the key of A major. After an introduction in D chord on the guitar the verse begins in A (I) on \\"When I see you I just don't know what to say\\" ending that line with E (V). The verse also features a D (IV) chord.

Geography Rockingham is situated on the western shore of Bedford Basin. It is north of Clayton Park and Fairview and south of Bedford; specifically, Birch Cove and Princes Lodge. Its eastern extent is formed by the shore of the Bedford Basin and its western extent is generally the top of the ridge that rises from the Basin, although this was subsequently extended westward to an area near the Birch Cove Lakes and Highway 102. History The first Europeans to settle in what was to become Rockingham were foreign Protestant farmers and innkeepers, starting in 1784. While the inns were too close to the city to benefit from stage coach traffic, they were conveniently located for drovers bringing their livestock to the Halifax market. Drovers lodged at the inns and kept their animals in the pastures while they arranged for their sale and slaughter.Sharon and Wayne Ingalls, Sweet Suburb: A History of Prince's Lodge, Birch Cove, and Rockingham (Glen Margaret 2010) 55-63 and 111-114. In the 1840s William Evens and William Davey bought properties on the western shore of the basin. Evens, a butcher, built a slaughterhouse, while Davey established a large inn called the Four Mile House. When the Nova Scotia Railway was being built the two men persuaded the railway board to locate the first stop at Four Mile House. On February 1, 1855, the first ceremonial run of the Nova Scotia Railway came to Four Mile House. The village that grew up around the railway station took the name Four Mile House.Ingalls and Ingalls, Sweet Suburb 153-164. In 1886, the residents of the Four Mile House district decided their community needed a name that better reflected its growing prosperity. The name Rockingham Station was inspired by the Rockingham Inn that had been located two miles north at Prince's Lodge. This particular inn had burned down in 1833 but lived on in memory due to its links with Lieutenant Governor Sir John Wentworth, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, a powerful English noble and friend of the Wentworths.Ingalls and Ingalls, Sweet Suburb 178-179 The construction of the Nova Scotia Railway in 1855 altered the character of the community. Destruction of the shoreline cut off farmers from some resources, but eventually the railway helped the village to grow and prosper. Country life was now easily accessible; wealthy families built grand summer homes and transient visitors enjoyed staying at the Wayside Inn (formerly the Five Mile House) and other tourist accommodations in Rockingham. Ingalls and Ingalls, Sweet Suburb 178-201. The Four Mile House district was selected by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul in the early 1870s for a convent and institution of higher learning. \\"Mount St. Vincent\\" was built up the hill on a large parcel of land almost directly opposite the NSR station. The convent, along with its women's finishing school, Mount St. Vincent Academy and associated residence facilities opened in 1873 following approximately one year of construction. The Intercolonial Railway (ICR), which had taken over the NSR, expropriated waterfront land at Rockingham Station from the Sisters of Charity during the early 1900s to widen its trackage leading to Fairview. Immediately prior to the Halifax Explosion, telegraph operator Vince Coleman (train dispatcher) managed to warn an incoming passenger train to hold at Rockingham Station's passenger station (the last ICR station stop before Richmond terminal), ultimately saving countless lives. The new rock cut being built for the railway through south end Halifax was finished in 1918 under the newly created Canadian National Railways (CNR), with some of the blasted rock being used as infill to create the Halifax Ocean Terminals in the south end of the city, as well as infill of Bedford Basin off Rockingham Station to create what is now the Rockingham Railway Yard. In 1925, Mount St. Vincent Academy was upgraded in status to a women's junior college. The community of Rockingham Station began to experience some subdivision of land as it was located in a cheaper tax jurisdiction (the Municipality of the County of Halifax) as opposed to the adjacent city which ended at Fairview. On April 5, 1961, the village's name was formally simplified by the provincial government to just Rockingham. The creation of Bicentennial Drive, an all-weather bypass highway to Bedford, likely spurred construction of the first major subdivision developments in 1962, although much of the Rockingham area on the hillside overlooking Bedford Basin would require significant blasting to create streets and underground services. Mount St. Vincent College was upgraded to a full university, named Mount St. Vincent University, in 1966. On January 1, 1969, the community of Rockingham, along with many other surrounding areas of the Municipality of Halifax County were amalgamated into the City of Halifax. Rockingham continued to benefit from being located immediately north of the peninsular city on the Highway 102 corridor to Bedford and beyond. The opening of the A. Murray MacKay Bridge in 1970 led to improved connections between Rockingham and western Halifax to the City of Dartmouth and particularly a new industrial park named Burnside which would become a major regional employer. A smaller industrial park named Bayers Lake was also built near Rockingham on the west side of Highway 102. New residential developments in the expanding city were subsequently built in Rockingham such as the Clayton Park subdivision, located along the eastern slope of Geizer's Hill on the Rockingham-Fairview boundary. During the 1970s-1980s, CN Rail and later Via Rail operated a form of commuter rail passenger service on the railway line along Bedford Basin into downtown Halifax using frequently scheduled Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) which were destined for Yarmouth, Moncton and Sydney. Rockingham's station was closed after the January 15, 1990 budget cuts to Via Rail saw these services discontinued. The Bedford Highway was redeveloped during the early 1990s into a major collector road from Birch Cove into the city. On April 1, 1996, the City of Halifax was merged into the Halifax Regional Municipality. Preceding and following amalgamation, subdivision development in the western part of Rockingham continued apace, spurred in particular by the opening of Dunbrack Street and Northwest Arm Drive, however the most significant period of recent growth in Rockingham occurred between 1997-2003 with the Clayton Park West subdivision which was a 20-year development that filled within a quarter of the budgeted timeframe. Clayton Park West became one of the fastest-growing, densest new developments in Nova Scotian urban history. The rapid development was spurred by the conversion of the Bayers Lake Industrial Park into a \\"business park\\" model containing Halifax's first big box outlet stores, as well as new highway interchange construction between Lacewood Drive and Highway 102. Today, the focus of Rockingham has moved from the former suburban centre located on the Bedford Highway, slightly north of Mount St. Vincent University and the CN station, to the new development at Clayton Park West which now extends to the northern extents of Rockingham at the Kearney Lake Road.

He coached Hawthorn to premierships in 1961, 1971 and 1976. Early life/playing career Kennedy was born in Camberwell, Victoria, on 29 December 1928. In 1950, he joined the Hawthorn Football Club as a ruckman. Over the next ten years, he played 164 games for Hawthorn, serving as captain from 1955 until his retirement in 1959, and winning the club's Best and Fairest award four times (in 1950‚Äì1952, and 1954) respectively. Coaching career Kennedy received a rushed introduction to coaching in 1957 when regular coach Jack Hale was involved in a vehicle accident on the way to Glenferrie Oval and missed the Round 11 match. For the 1960 season he took over permanently as Hawthorn coach, and led the team to their first premiership in 1961. Following a Grand Final defeat to Geelong in 1963, he was forced to step down as coach when the Victorian Education Department offered him a job as a school principal in Stawell. Hawthorn's poor on-field performance over the next few years saw him recalled to the role in 1967. He coached Hawthorn to premierships in 1971 and 1976, as well as a Grand Final loss in 1975. He stepped down as coach again in 1976, in all coaching Hawthorn to three premierships from five Grand Finals. In 1985, Kennedy became the coach of the North Melbourne Football Club, and coached the club until 1989; his best result with North Melbourne was fourth in 1985. In total he coached for 411 games, winning 236, losing 170 and drawing five. Legacy As a player, Kennedy was renowned for his toughness and skill. As a coach, he had a similar reputation for toughness, but also for oratory. He was notorious for borrowing ideas from any source he thought would inspire the players, but it was his passion rather than his quotations that he was best known for. In the 1975 VFL Grand Final against North Melbourne, his exhortation to the Hawthorn players at half time was: \\"At least DO SOMETHING! DO! Don't think, don't hope, do! At least you can come off and say 'I did this, I shepherded, I played on. At least I did something.'\\" Despite this, his team still lost convincingly. He was famous for his battered brown overcoat, which is now on display at the Hawthorn Football Club. He was an inaugural inductee into the Australian Football Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1999. His son John Kennedy Jr., also played for the Hawks, playing eight matches against Kangaroo teams coached by his father. Kennedy's grandson Josh Kennedy was recruited by Hawthorn under the father/son rule in the 2006 AFL Draft, but played most of his career with the Sydney Swans. On 1 June 2020, John Kennedy Sr. became the 29th legend of the Australian Football Hall of Fame. AFL Commission Chairman Richard Goyder said: \\"In the Australian Football Hall of Fame, our Legends stand above our greats and, on behalf of the selectors, it is my great honour to declare John Kennedy was elected as a Legend, recognising his six-decade contribution to our game.\\" =Statue= Bronze statue of Kennedy in front of Waverley Park In honour of Kennedy's 80th birthday, a statue of him overlooking the Hawthorns' Waverley Park stadium was unveiled. The text on the plaque reads: : John \\"Kanga\\" Kennedy played 164 games for the Hawthorn Football Club in 1950‚Äì59, including its first ever finals appearance in 1957. In 1960 aged just 31 Kennedy became coach and transformed Hawthorn and led the club to its first three premierships in 1961, 1971 and 1976. :Kennedy's Hawthorn teams became known as \\"Kennedy's Commandos\\". Wearing his trademark overcoat, his booming voice and stirring words inspired generations of Hawthorn players, taking them from easy beats to the most respected and revered club in the League. :He epitomised and taught all the values and attitudes that the Club cherishes. These were overwhelmingly a sense of TEAM, total DISCIPLINE, total INTEGRITY, and WILL to WIN at all costs. They are now core values, part of the club's character and as we compete in the 21st century this legacy as defined by John Kennedy will never be forgotten. Death Kennedy died at the age of 91, on 24 June 2020, the day before his grandson Josh Kennedy was to play his 250th AFL game.

Biography She was born Ruth Bancroft Law on May 21, 1887 to Sarah Bancroft Breed and Frederick Henry Law in Lynn, Massachusetts. She was inspired to take up flying by her brother, parachutist and pioneer movie stuntman Rodman Law (1885‚Äì1919), with whom she challenged herself to physically keep up during their childhood. She was instructed by Harry Atwood and Arch Freeman at Atwood Park in Saugus, Massachusetts, having been refused lessons by Orville Wright because, according to Law, he believed that women weren't mechanically inclined, but this only made her more determined, later saying \\"The surest way to make me do a thing is to tell me I can't do it.\\" She was an adept mechanic. She received her pilot's license in November 1912, and in 1915 gave a demonstration of aerobatics at Daytona Beach, Florida, before a large crowd. She announced that she was going to \\"loop the loop\\" for the first time, and proceeded to do so, not once but twice, to the consternation of her husband, Charles Oliver. In the spring of 1916, she took part in an altitude competition, twice narrowly coming in second to male fliers. She was furious, determined to set a record that would stand against men as well as women. Her greatest feat took place on 19 November 1916, when she broke the existing cross-America flight air speed record of 452 miles (728 km) set by Victor Carlstrom by flying nonstop from Chicago to New York State, a distance of 590 miles (950 km). The next day she flew on to New York City. Flying over Manhattan, her fuel cut out, but she glided to a safe landing on Governors Island and was met by United States Army Captain Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold (who changed her spark plugs in the Curtiss pusher), who would one day become Commanding General of the United States Army Air Forces. President Woodrow Wilson attended a dinner held in her honor on 2 December 1916. Billboard. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, she campaigned unsuccessfully for women to be allowed to fly military aircraft. Stung by her rejection, she wrote an article entitled \\"Let Women Fly!\\" in the magazine Air Travel, where she argued that success in aviation should prove a woman's fitness for work in that field. After the war, she continued to set records. After Raymonde de Laroche of France set a women's altitude record of nearly 13,000 feet (3,962 m) on 7 June 1919,Pawlak, p. 17. She broke Laroches record on 10 June, flying to 14,700 feet (4,481 m). Laroche in turn, however, broke Olivers record on 12 June, flying to a height of 15,748 feet (4,800 m).Pawlak, p. 17, claims the height reached was 15,748 feet (4,800 m). On a morning in 1922, Law woke up to read with surprise an announcement of her retirement in the newspaper; her husband had tired of her dangerous job and had taken that step to end her flying career, and she acquiesced to his demand. She attributed a 1932 nervous breakdown to the lack of flying, having settled down in a Los Angeles, spending her days gardening. In 1948, Law attended a Smithsonian event in Washington, D.C. celebrating the donation of the Wright brothers' Kitty Hawk plane, despite Orville Wright's earlier refusal to teach her. Notwithstanding her accomplished career in aviation, she traveled by train. She died on December 1, 1970, in San Francisco. She is buried in Pine Grove Cemetery in Lynn, Massachusetts.

Its aim was the peaceful overturning of Spanish colonial rule and achievement of Western Sahara's self-determination. It initially organized and operated in secret, but revealed its existence in a demonstration in El-Aaiun (Laayoune) against Spanish rule in 1970, attempting to hand over a petition to the Spanish colonial rulers calling for better treatment and Western Sahara's independence. The protest was immediately and bloodily suppressed by the colonial forces. The massacre and ensuing disturbances has been named the Zemla Intifada, or uprising, after the place the demonstration was held. A nationwide hunt for members of the movement followed: Bassiri himself was arrested and \\"disappeared\\" in Spanish custody. He is assumed to have been killed by his jailors, and is counted by the present-day Sahrawi nationalist movement as its first modern-day martyr.(Morocco, which claims Western Sahara as its own province, has also similarly attempted to appropriate his legacy, arguing that the Harakat Tahrir was primarily interested in ejecting Spain, not in achieving independence as a nation separate from Morocco.)

The largest deployments of the DST include the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass payment system (approximately 7 million transponders), as well as a variety of vehicle immobilizer systems used in many late model Ford, Lincoln, Mercury, Toyota, and Nissan vehicles. The DST is an unpowered \\"passive\\" transponder which uses a proprietary block cipher to implement a challenge-response authentication protocol. Each DST tag contains a quantity of non-volatile RAM, which stores a 40-bit encryption key. This key is used to encipher a 40-bit challenge issued by the reader, producing a 40-bit ciphertext, which is then truncated to produce a 24-bit response transmitted back to the reader. Verifiers (who also possess the encryption key) verify this challenge by computing the expected result and comparing it to the tag response. Transponder encryption keys are user programmable, using a simple over-the-air protocol. Once correctly programmed, transponders may be \\"locked\\" through a separate command, which prevents further changes to the internal key value. Each transponder is factory provisioned with a 24-bit serial number and 8-bit manufacturer code. These values are fixed, and cannot be altered. The DST40 cipher Until 2005, the DST cipher (DST40) was a trade secret of Texas Instruments, made available to customers under non-disclosure agreement. This policy was likely instituted due to the cipher's non-standard design and small key size, which rendered it vulnerable to brute-force keysearch. In 2005, a group of students from the Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute and RSA Laboratories reverse-engineered the cipher using an inexpensive Texas Instruments evaluation kit, through schematics of the cipher leaked onto Internet, and black-box techniques [1] (i.e., querying transponders via the radio interface, rather than dismantling them to examining the circuitry). Once the cipher design was known, the team programmed several FPGA devices to perform brute- force key searches based on known challenge/response pairs. Using a single FPGA device, the team was able to recover a key from two known challenge/response pairs in approximately 11 hours (average case). With an array of 16 FPGA devices, they reduced this time to less than one hour. DST40 is a 200-round unbalanced Feistel cipher, in which L0 is 38 bits, and R0 is 2 bits. The key schedule is a simple linear feedback shift register, which updates every three rounds, resulting in some weak keys (e.g., the zero key). Although the cipher is potentially invertible, the DST protocol makes use of only the encipher mode. When used in the protocol with the 40‚Äì24-bit output truncation, the resulting primitive is more aptly described as a Message Authentication Code rather than an encryption function. Although a truncated block cipher represents an unusual choice for such a primitive, this design has the advantage of precisely bounding the number of collisions for every single key value. The DST40 cipher is one of the most widely used unbalanced Feistel ciphers in existence. Reaction and fixes The vulnerability exposed by the Hopkins team indicates potential security threats to millions of vehicles which are protected using DST-based immobilizer systems, and to the Exxon-Mobil Speedpass system. The ideal solution to this problem is to replace the DST transponder in these systems with a device provisioned with a more robust cryptographic circuit utilizing a longer key length. However, the cost of recalling these security systems is prohibitively high, and, as of October 2005, neither Texas Instruments, Exxon-Mobil or any vehicle manufacturer has announced such a recall. Currently the most effective protections against this attack rely on user vigilance, e.g., protecting transponder keys, auditing Speedpass invoices for fraud, and optionally using a metallic shield (such as aluminum foil) to prevent unauthorized scanning of DST tags.

It was discovered on 15 May 1840 on the southern bank of a bend of the River Ribble, in an area called Cuerdale near Preston, Lancashire, England. The Cuerdale Hoard is one of the largest Viking silver hoards ever found, four times larger than its nearest rival in Britain or Ireland, according to Richard Hall.Viking Age Archaeology 1995:46. In weight and number of pieces, it is second only to the Spillings Hoard found on Gotland, Sweden. The coins in the hoard are from three sources, represented in the proportions 5:1:1. Viking kingdoms of eastern England are represented in the largest portion; the other two portions are of Alfred's Kingdom of Wessex and of coins from foreign sources, which include Byzantine, Scandinavian, Islamic, Papal, North Italian and Carolingian mintings, many of the last from Aquitaine perhaps, Richard Hall suggests, acquired there in the Viking raids of 898.Richard Hall 1995:46. Discovery The hoard was found by a group of workmen repairing the embankment of the river. It was in a lead box, which shows evidence of the hoard having been parcelled into small bags or packages. After discovery it was quickly recovered by the landowner's bailiffs, ensuring it remained together, though the workmen managed to keep a coin each. The remainder was declared treasure trove and handed to Queen Victoria as the Duke of Lancaster. The Duchy passed it to the British Museum in London, where the bulk of it remains today. About 60 items selected from the hoard are held and displayed by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Some coins minted at Quentovic in northern France (possibly near present-day √âtaples) are held by the Ch√¢teau-mus√©e de Boulogne-sur-Mer. Origins Another display in the British Museum It is believed the coins were buried between 903 and 910, soon after the Vikings had been expelled from Dublin in 902. At this time the Ribble Valley was an important Viking route between the Irish Sea and York. The presence of large numbers of newly minted Norse coins from York and large amounts of Irish Norse bullion leads experts to believe this may have been a war chest belonging to Irish Norse exiles intending to reoccupy Dublin from the Ribble Estuary, but there have also been many other theories about its ownership and purpose. A selection in the Ashmolean Museum In 1966 the numismatist M. Banks suggested that the hoard was not even buried by Vikings, although it was Viking treasure, or much of it was. Banks suggested that the Cuerdale Hoard might have been a gift to English churches suffering persecution in the areas called the Danelaw that were occupied by pagan Vikings. Since so many of the coins were apparently minted across the Channel, said Banks, they were probably a contribution from the Frankish Christians to their English brothers. Many such mysteries surround the Cuerdale trove. Little archaeological investigation has yet been done of the site of Cuerdale Hall. Such an investigation might reveal why the hoard was buried in that location. The orientation of the old hall and roads and fields to the south suggests that a ford or bridge existed near the present site of Cuerdale Hall. Rob Curedale,Curedale.com a descendant of the De Keuerdale family, proposed an alternative theory that the hoard was buried by Sir Thomas de Molyneux who occupied Cuerdale Hall and raised an army of several thousand with help from Irish nobility to support Richard II. The treasure could have been several hundred years old when brought from an unknown location in Ireland at the direction of Richard II and buried at Cuerdale. Other theories include that the silver was intended for a casting works in the vicinity. Remains of fortifications and moat suggest that a larger building once occupied the present site of Cuerdale Hall. Folklore The existence of the hoard may have been known long before its eventual rediscovery. A local Preston tradition said that anyone who stood on the south bank of the Ribble at Walton-le-Dale, and looked upriver to Ribchester, would be within sight of the richest treasure in England. The Ribchester Helmet had been found as part of a Roman hoard in 1796.History of the county palatine ... of Lancaster. The biographical department by W.R. Whatton, 1836, p.20, accessed September 2010 Contexts The presence of the Vikings can be seen today in Preston through numerous place names. The Cuerdale Hoard is an example of the rich archaeology that exists around the Preston area and includes evidence of prehistoric and significant Roman history. The hoard was number 9 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 BBC Television documentary Our Top Ten Treasures presented by Adam Hart-Davis.

He is the genius young of the Oniwabansh≈´ for Edo Castle. After the Meiji Restoration Shinomori alone was offered rankings in the military, however, instead of abandoning his comrades, he decided to work with them for Takeda Kanry≈´. This decision leads to the death of his comrades and his defeat by Himura Kenshin, which results in driving him mad. For the remainder of the series, Shinomori swears to kill Kenshin at any cost in order to gain the title of \\"the strongest\\" and bestow this title upon the graves of his fallen comrades. Creation and conception Shinsengumi leader Hijikata Toshiz≈ç was the model for Shinomori's character. Nobuhiro Watsuki based Shinomori on Hijikata Toshiz≈ç, the deputy Leader of the Shinsengumi. There are most certainly versions of Hijikata portrayed in books and fiction; Aoshi grew out of the Hijikata who killed his gentler feelings and buried his human weakness. Watsuki describes himself as a fan of the other version of Hijikata. Watsuki describes that version of Hijikata, seen in Moeyo Ken (Burn, O Sword), as \\"a bundle of raw combat-instinct who keeps fighting until the very death.\\" Since, according to Watsuki, the addition of the Oniwabansh≈´ occurred during the \\"last minute,\\" he found difficulty writing with him since he had not resolved a \\"concrete image\\" for Aoshi. Watsuki says that he used no specific design model for Aoshi. As the image of Hijikata grew stronger within Watsuki, the Rurouni Kenshin author added fringes (bangs) to Aoshi's design. Watsuki held a chance to change the hairstyle while compiling the edited manga, but chose not to edit the hairstyle, since he did not want readers to believe that \\"Aoshi was wearing a rug or anything.\\" \\"The Secret Life of Characters (13) Okashira ‚óè Shinomori Aoshi,\\" Rurouni Kenshin Volume 4. VIZ Media. 184. Watsuki said he originally intended for his design of the 13-year-old \\"young Aoshi\\" to be used for another character. He says that many female readers liked young Aoshi. He described drawing Aoshi's fringes as \\"a pain.\\"Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \\"Act 25: Duel of the Masters.\\" Rurouni Kenshin Volume 4. VIZ Media. 55. During the run of the Kyoto arc, Watsuki reported receiving a reader letter that said \\"I'll bet Aoshi is gonna be another one of those characters who just happens to be around to help Kenshin in times of need.\\" The letter \\"kind of got to\\" Watsuki and he told himself that Aoshi is going to be a \\"bad guy.\\" As a response Watsuki decided to make Aoshi an antagonist in the arc and fight Okina (Kashiwazaki Nenji), his former master.Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \\"The Secret Life of Characters (31) Okina (Kashiwazaki Nenji),\\" Rurouni Kenshin Volume 11.

Shinomori is portrayed by Yusuke Iseya in the second and third live-action films, Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno and Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends.New Live-Action Rurouni Kenshin Films Cast S≈çjir≈ç, Aoshi Character outline =Background= Born in January 1853 in Tokyo Prefecture, Shinomori Aoshi was raised a ninja of the Oniwabansh≈´, who worked for the Shogunate government during the Edo period. At the suggestion of Kashiwazaki Nenji (better known as Okina), Shinomori was given the position of Okashira at the age of fifteen, in time for the Oniwabanshou to defend Edo Castle. As a member of the Oniwabanshuu, he helped to raise Makimachi Misao from childhood. Misao, who was his protegee developed a strong admiration and romantic feelings for him. After the revolution, since a few members of the Oniwabansh≈´ were unable to adapt to life in the Meiji era, Aoshi and these members worked for the corrupt, power-hungry business man, Takeda Kanry≈´ instead. Aoshi's subordinates included Beshimi, who specialized in darts and poison; Hyottoko, whose name literally means \\"Fire Man\\" who breathes fire; Han'nya, a skilled martial artist and deft ninjutsu practitioner; and Shikij≈ç, a scarred \\"muscle man\\". =Techniques= Shinomori drawing his double kodachi in the anime adaptation. Aoshi is a grandmaster and Okashira of the Oniwanbanshou shinobi. Aoshi's weapon of choice is a kodachi, a sword that is described in the series to act like a shield because its light weight makes it easy to block with. He originally used only one of these short swords for defense and relied mainly on kenpo for his offense, but later used a two- sworded style. When in their saya, they appear to be part of a single sheathed sword, one blade appearing to be the hilt, while the second blade is stationed opposite the first and blends in with the saya itself, giving it the impression of being a nodachi. A dangerous opponent, he uses his speed together with a mix of sword and hand-to-hand combat moves. His physical strength is extremely high, having once knocked Sanosuke out with one blow to the back of the neck in the anime, and break Suzaku's sword in his grip in the manga. * Aoshi blocks an enemies striking weapon with one kodachi, then strikes it with the second kodachi, thrusting the first one through. *Jissen Kenbu: (Actual-Battle Sword-Dance) Combo attack using \\"Ry≈´sui no Ugoki\\" to flow around the enemy, confusing them with a constant change in speed. Aoshi will then strike from various points, slashing them with his kodachi, then ending it with \\"Kaiten Kenbu\\". Before deciding to use a two kodachi style of fighting, this was Aoshi's final attack. Though he is nearly impossible to hit during the Jissen Kenbu, his switch from a defensive to an offensive stance is visible and allows enough time for a counter, a weakness exploited by Kenshin, and later Shishio. * Aoshi claims to have used this attack to defeat \\"all who have intruded upon Edo castle\\". It involves Aoshi rapidly spinning around three times, while holding the kodachi backhand, to slash the opponent thrice in an instant. Aoshi usually uses this attack after disorienting the opponent with Ry≈´sui no Ugoki. * This attack is Aoshi's ≈çugi. The attack involves Aoshi gripping his kodachi backhand, then slashing the opponent six times in rapid succession, an upgrade from Kaiten Kenbu made possible by the use of two kodachi, from both sides. In the anime, Shishio claims that the move relies on confusing the opponent on the direction from which each subsequent strike is going to come (a simplified explanation of Shishio's ability to counter it after Aoshi had been weakened and slowed by Kenshin's ≈çugi). * Aoshi throws both kodachi at the opponent, hitting the end of the first one with the second one for an extra boost. The second kodachi is hidden directly behind the first, so the opponent would only see one kodachi heading for them in their line of sight. * Aoshi crosses the two kodachi and moves them outwards in a scissor-like cut. * This is moving technique where Aoshi moves around silently, rapidly alternating between fast and slow movements and confusing the opponent due to the fluid motion & continuously changing speed. It can be countered by watching for the moment the user attempts to strike. Plot overview Yusuke Iseya portrays Shinomori in the live-action film adaptations. While working with Kanry≈´ as \\"muscle\\" in his opium manufacturing operation, Aoshi came face to face with Kenshin, who was trying to rescue Takani Megumi. During the confrontation with Kenshin, Aoshi revealed that he aims to kill Kenshin, who was formerly known as the famed Hitokiri Batt≈çsai. After an intense fight, their battle ends with Aoshi's defeat when Aoshi is struck a second time to the throat by his own Kodachi after Kenshin narrowly escapes death by having his scabbard reduce the damage brought on by Aoshi's Kaiten Kenbu. Kanry≈´ betrays Aoshi and kills his four subordinates with a Gatling gun while they die one after the other protecting Aoshi, and when Kenshin had gripped his sword Kanryu ran out of bullets (in the anime, Beshimi threw a dart into the ammo belt, which jammed, allowing Kenshin to get in close) and was soon struck by Kenshin's sakabato and arrested. After the deaths of his friends and team-mates, Aoshi became even more determined to defeat Kenshin, obsessed even, stating that it is the only thing he can do for his fallen comrades now, to obtain the title of the strongest and bring it before their graves as flower. Determined to achieve his goal, Aoshi follows him to Kyoto after training intensely for a few months and narrowly missing him when Kenshin heads to Kyoto with Saito and Misao, and joins Shishio Makoto (despite initially rejecting the offer) in hopes of fighting Kenshin. He lets no one stand in his way, going as far as fighting and severely injuring Okina (Kenshin however later remarks that Aoshi subconsciously held back against his former comrade) to try to learn of Kenshin's whereabouts (but fails to get the location). Aoshi joins forces with Shishio Makoto and plans to kill Kenshin and then commit suicide. Towards the end of the Kyoto Arc, the much- anticipated battle arrives and Kenshin fights Aoshi. Kenshin saves Aoshi from his own madness, as he realizes that death is not the answer to his situation. To put an end to the feud and see who is truly the strongest, both decide to use their strongest attacks resulting in Kenshin's victory. Even though Kenshin's ougi, Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki, activated after Aoshi's Kaiten Kenbu Rokuren (which was already cutting his neck), the sheer speed of the attack allowed it to strike first and incapacitate Aoshi. He later appears to fight against Shishio, though still weakened from Kenshin's Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki, yet he still managed to buy time for Kenshin, who had been knocked unconscious by Shishio, to get back on his feet. Aoshi spends his time meditating in a temple, needing time to sort through what he has done and been through. Before Kenshin leaves Kyoto, he asks if Aoshi would like to share a drink (of sake) with him; Aoshi refuses the offer (saying that he does not drink), but goes on to say he would be willing to have tea with him when they meet again. In the Jinch≈´ Arc, Aoshi returns to Tokyo with Misao in order to deliver the diary of Yukishiro Tomoe to Kamiya Kaoru. They arrived to discover that Kaoru is \\"dead,\\" though Aoshi soon solves the mystery and reveals that the body buried of Kaoru was actually a doll, created by a man named Gein. Subsequently, he defeats Gein in the graveyard after the latter returns to try to retrieve his creation which he considers his masterpiece, and allows him to burn in the flames who he himself started after telling him that Aoshi burned the doll as a sign of pity. Joining Kenshin and his friends as they travel to Yukishiro Enishi's island to rescue Kaoru, he defeats Suzaku, a master mimic who is one of the four Sushin bodyguards of Enishi's second in command before leaving Kenshin to fight Enishi. Following the battle, he and Misao return with the group to Tokyo, only for Aoshi to announce that they will return to Kyoto very soon because the high mountains where he will buried the remains of his four comrades will hit winter before the plains do, and they will have to give them a finer resting place. Before leaving, he honors Kenshin's request in Kyoto by having a cup of tea with him. Reception Daryl Surat of Otaku USA said that while, in Surat's view, Aoshi does not engaged in \\"meaningful\\" battles, the character scored highly in popularity polls among readers because Aoshi appears \\"like a CLAMP character wearing Gambit's coat.\\" Surat used Aoshi as an example of Rurouni Kenshin being a \\"neo-shonen\\" work that appeals to both boys and girls.Surat, Daryl. \\"Heart of Steel.\\" Otaku USA.

The Senjinkun was regarded as a supplement to the Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors, which was already required reading for the Japanese military. It listed a number of exhortations regarding military regulations, combat readiness, esprit de corps, filial piety, veneration of Shinto kami, and Japan's kokutai. The code specifically forbade retreat or surrender.Toland, The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire, page 512. The quote \\"Never live to experience shame as a prisoner\\" was repeatedly cited as the cause of numerous suicides committed by soldiers and civilians; in particular, the code resulted in considerably higher battle fatalities and extremely low surrender counts for Japanese ground forces, who would often launch suicide attacks or commit suicide outright when faced with defeat. Japanese soldiers were instructed to \\"show mercy to those who surrender\\"--a response to prior misconduct on the battlefield.Dower, War Without Mercy: Race and Power in the Pacific War, page 26 Gyokusai or \\"Shattering like a Jewel\\": Reflection on the Pacific War Towards the end of the war, copies of the Senjinkun were also distributed to the civilian population of Japan as part of the preparation for Operation Downfall, the expected invasion of the Japanese home islands by Allied forces. Excerpt from the Senjinkun introduction :The battlefield is where the Imperial Army, acting under the Imperial Command, displays its true character, conquering whenever it attacks, winning whenever it engages in combat, in order to spread the Imperial Way far and wide so that the enemy may look up in awe to the august virtues of His Majesty.Dower, Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II, page 277. :The Imperial Rescript to the armed forces is explicit while the regulations and manuals clearly define conduct in combat and methods of training. Conditions in the zone of combat, however, tend to cause soldiers to be swayed by immediate events and become forgetful of their duties. Indeed, they should be wary there, lest they run counter to their duties as soldiers. The purpose of the present Code lies in providing concrete rules of conduct, in the light of past experience, so that those in zones of combat may wholly abide by the Imperial Rescript and enhance the moral virtues of the Imperial Army.

It would typically be modified depending on the indication and integrated with other examinations especially the respiratory examination. Like all medical examinations, the cardiac examination follows the standard structure of inspection, palpation and auscultation. Positioning The patient is positioned in the supine position tilted up at 45 degrees if the patient can tolerate this. The head should rest on a pillow and the arms by their sides. The level of the jugular venous pressure (JVP) should only be commented on in this position as flatter or steeper angles lead to artificially elevated or reduced level respectively. Also, left ventricular failure leads to pulmonary edema which increases and may impede breathing if the patient is laid flat. Lighting should be adjusted so that it is not obscured by the examiner who will approach from the right hand side of the patient as is medical custom. The torso and neck should be fully exposed and access should be available to the legs. Inspection General Inspection: *Inspect the patient status whether he or she is comfortable at rest or obviously short of breath.250 cases in clinical medicine 3rd edition. R. R. Baliga *Inspect the neck for increased jugular venous pressure (JVP) or abnormal waves.250 cases in clinical medicine 3rd edition. R. R. Baliga *Any abnormal movements such as head bobbing. *There are specific signs associated with cardiac illness and abnormality however, during inspection any noticed cutaneous sign should be noted. Inspect the hands for: *Temperature - described as warm or cool, clammy or dry *Skin turgor for hydration *Janeway lesion *Osler's node *At the nails Splinter hemorrhage and Quincke's pulsation should be looked for as well as any deformity of the nail such as Beau's lines, clubbing or peripheral cyanosis. Inspect the head for: *Cheeks for the malar flush of mitral stenosis. *The eyes for corneal arcus and surrounding tissue for xanthalasma. *Conjunctiva pallor a sign of anemia. *The mouth for hygiene. *The mucosa for hydration and pallor or central cyanosis. *The ear lobes for Frank's sign. Then inspect the precordium for: * visible pulsations * apex beat * masses * scars * lesions * signs of trauma and previous surgery (e.g. median sternotomy) * permanent Pace Maker * praecordial bulge Palpation The pulses should be palpated, first the radial pulse commenting on rate and rhythm then the brachial pulse commenting on character and finally the carotid pulse again for character. The pulses may be: *Bounding as in large pulse pressure found in aortic regurgitation or CO2 retention. *And the rhythm should be assessed as regular, regularly irregular or irregularly irregular. *Consistency of the strength to assess for Pulsus alternans. *Slow rising as found in aortic stenosis known as parvus et tardus *Jerky as found in HOCM *Pulses can also be auscultated for features like Traube's pistol shot femoral pulse. =Palpation of the precordium= The valve areas are palpated for abnormal pulsations (palpable heart murmurs known as thrills) and precordial movements (known as heaves). Heaves are best felt with the heel of the hand at the sternal border. =Palpation of the apex beat= The apex beat is found approximately in the 5th left intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. It can be impalpable for a variety of reasons including obesity, emphysema, effusion and rarely dextrocardia. The apex beat is assessed for size, amplitude, location, impulse and duration. There are specific terms to describe the sensation such as tapping, heaving and thrusting. Often the apex beat is felt diffusely over a large area, in this case the most inferior and lateral position it can be felt in should be described as well as the location of the largest amplitude. Finally the sacrum and ankles are checked for pitting edema which is caused by right ventricular failure in isolation or as part of congestive cardiac failure. Auscultation One should comment on * S1 and S2 - if the splitting is abnormal or louder than usual. * S3 - the emphasis and timing of the syllables in the word Kentucky is similar to the pattern of sounds in a precordial S3. * S4 - the emphasis and timing of the syllables in the word Tennessee is similar to the pattern of sounds in a precordial S4. * If S4 S1 S2 S3 Also known as a gallop rhythm. * diastolic murmurs (e.g. aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis) * systolic murmurs (e.g. aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation) * pericardial rub (suggestive of pericarditis) *The base of the lungs should be auscultated for signs of pulmonary oedema due to a cardiac cause such as bilateral basal crepitations. Completion of examination To complete the exam blood pressure should be checked, an ECG recorded, funduscopy performed to assess for Roth spots or papilledema. A full peripheral circulation exam should be performed.

The important kings of this dynasty are Harishchandra, Dileepa, Raghu and Rama.  Battle with the Asuras  Once, in a battle, the Devas were defeated by the Asuras. Tormented by arrows, they sought help from king Muchukunda. King Muchukunda agreed to help them and fought against the asuras for a long time.http://www.mythfolklore.net/india/encyclopedia/muchukunda.htm Since the Devas did not have an able commander, king Muchukunda protected them against the onslaught by asuras, until the Devas got an able commander like Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiva. Then Indra said to the king Muchukunda, \\"O king, we, the Devas are indebted to you for the help and protection which you have given us, by sacrificing your own family life. Here in the heaven, one second equals one year of the earth and you had fought with asuras for one year of heaven. Since, it has been a long time, there is no sign of your kingdom and family because it has been destroyed with the passage of time. We are happy and pleased with you, so ask for any boon except Moksha (liberation) because Moksha (liberation) is beyond our capacities\\". Muchukunda asks Indra for a boon to sleep. While fighting on the side of the Devas, King Muchukunda did not get an opportunity to sleep even for a moment. Now, since his responsibilities were over, overcome by tiredness, he was feeling very sleepy. So, he said, \\"O King of the Devas, I want to sleep. Anyone who dares to disturb my sleep should get burnt to ashes immediately\\". Indra said, \\"So be it, go to the earth and enjoy your sleep, one who awakens you would be reduced to ashes\\". After this, King Muchukunda descended to earth and selected a cave on a hill, where he could sleep undisturbed. The hills and the cave where Muchukunda rested is located to Mount Guttikonda Bilam, Palnadu Area, Guntur Dist. Andhra Pradesh (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttikonda_Bilam).  Kalayavan's death  Kalayavana Surrounds Mathura Page from a Dispersed Bhagavata Purana Series - Brooklyn Museum Kalayavan, the great Yavana warrior king, was killed by Muchukunda's gaze in the Indian epic MahƒÅbhƒÅrata. Kalayavan was undefeated and unmatched in battle due to a boon, but he was also merciless and cruel. He learns that Krishna is the only person who can defeat him in battle and accepting this challenge sets out to invade Krishna's kingdom, Mathura. When the two armies faced each other in battle, Krishna dismounts from his chariot and starts walking away, followed by Kalayavan. After a long time Krishna, followed by Kalayavan, enters a dark cave. In this cave Muchukunda was sleeping since the time he was blessed by king of deities. The person on whom Muchukunda's gaze falls is doomed to instantaneous death. Kalayavan in a fit of anger and unable to see in the dark attacks Muchukunda mistaking him to be Krishna. When Muchukunda opens his eyes, his gaze falls on Kalayavan who is immediately burnt to death. According to Hindu mythology, Muchukunda was an ancestor of Sri Rama, who belonged to Treta Yuga. Sri Krishna appears towards the end of Dwapara Yuga. So, Muchukunda is asleep for a long time. When he finally woke up, he was delighted to see Lord Sri Krishna. Sri Krishna advised him to perform Tapas to cleanse the accumulated sins, to attain Moksha (liberation). After meeting with Lord, Muchukunda set out of the cave. And the story narrates that he was astonished to see all creatures had shrunken in size over time while he rested in cave, indicating long ages gone by. Muchukunda then went to Gandamadana Mountain and from there to Badrika Ashrama for doing penance.  Muchukunda River  The Muchukunda river i.e.Musi River is a tributary of Krishna River in the Deccan Plateau region of Telangana state in India. It originates in Ananthagiri Hills of Rangareddy dist, the hills where Muchukunda had his long sleep. So, the river gets the name as that. It flows through a major portion of Hyderabad, India and divides the historic old city with the new city.

Upon auscultation, this sign is an extra heart sound of to-and-fro character, typically with three components, ONE systolic and TWO diastolic. It resembles the sound of squeaky leather and often is described as grating, scratching, or rasping. The sound seems very close to the ear and may seem louder than or may even mask the other heart sounds. The sound usually is best heard between the apex and sternum but may be widespread. Cause The pericardium is a double-walled sac around the heart. The inner and outer (visceral and parietal, respectively) layers are normally lubricated by a small amount of pericardial fluid, but the inflammation of pericardium causes the walls to rub against each other with audible friction. In children, rheumatic fever is often the cause of pericardial friction rub. Pericardial friction rubs can also be heard in pericarditis that is associated with uremia or post-myocardial infarction. Differential diagnosis Pericardial friction rub is one of several, similar sounds. A differential diagnosis may be possible, or not, depending upon the number of components that are audible. Pericardial friction rub may have one, two, or three audible components, whereas the similar pleural friction rub ordinarily has two audible components. One- and two-component rubs are ambiguous. A three-component rub distinguishes a pericardial rub and indicates the presence of pericarditis. Also, a pleural rub can only be heard during inspiration , whereas, the pericardial rub can be heard even after cessation of breathing. Pleural rub creates pain mostly on the lateral part of the chest wall, whereas pain due to pericardial rub is always central in location. The intensity of pleural rub is increased on pressing the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the affected area, whereas there is no such change in case of a pericardial rub.

KTXX- FM's transmitter is located on State Highway 71 on the west side of Austin.Radio-Locator.com/KTXX-FM The station has studios and offices along Loop 360 in Southwest Austin. KTXX-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format. Its HD3 digital subchannel simulcasts the progressive country format heard on co- owned 99.3 KOKE-FM. The HD4 subchannel airs a classic hits sound, known as \\"The Bat,\\" which feeds FM translator 105.3 K287FG. In addition, most of KTXX- FM's sports programming is heard on sister station AM 1260 KTAE in Taylor and its translator, 101.9 K270CO Austin. Programming KTXX-FM calls itself \\"The Horn,\\" referring to the Texas Longhorns. It is the flagship station for the University of Texas at Austin sports teams. KTXX-FM carries local sports shows during the day and airs programming from Houston-based SB Nation Radio on nights and weekends. History =KFFQ and KLKM= The station first signed on in 1984 as KFFQ, playing country music.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page B-267 It was originally licensed to Llano and was owned by Duane Fox. In 1988, it was acquired by Maxagrid Broadcasting, which switched 104.9 to a beautiful music format as KLKM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1990 page B-306 Around 2000, the station changed its city of license to Dripping Springs, Texas and became \\"Digital 104.9\\" KXXS. =104.9 The Beat= In February 2007, that format and call sign moved to 92.5, to make room for rhythmic contemporary station KXBT as \\"Beat 104.9\\". This was the third incarnation of \\"The Beat\\", which originally launched on 104.3 in 1998 as KQBT, although it later adopted the KXBT call letters on the same frequency after six months. The format moved from 104.3 due to a change in ownership when Entercom sold the frequency to Univision. The staff and lineup from \\"The Beat\\" was still intact, even though new owner Entercom let them go. They were hired by Border Media Partners (BMP). On September 26, 2008, BMP announced that KXBT will flip to Spanish Contemporary. On September 29, 2008, KXBT became a simulcast of KXXS. This allowed the station to be heard around Greater Austin, with KXBT serving the western portion and KXXS covering the eastern part of the market. The simulcast was called \\"Digital 104.9 y 92.5\\". The \\"Digital\\" simulcast was broken up in mid-2009, when 104.9 flipped to Regional Mexican. The Spanish Contemporary format was retained on 92.5. \\"The Beat\\" aired on 105.9 KFMK and later 102.3 KPEZ. =Sports radio= On November 2, 2009, the format changed to all-sports, and was branded as \\"104.9 The Horn\\". The brand is a tribute to the University of Texas at Austin sports teams, the Texas Longhorns. At first, KTXX-FM aired local sports shows and carried ESPN Radio programming nights and weekends. On January 2, 2014, the ESPN Radio programming was dropped. KTXX-FM became a hybrid of sports talk and classic hits. Morning and afternoon drive time, as well as the noon hour, remained local sports talk, while the other non-sporting event hours became classic hits. On May 5, 2014, more sports talk was added. The schedule had sports talk from 6am to 7pm and classic hits the rest of the day, unless a sporting event or specialty program was being broadcast. In February 2015, The Horn dropped the classic hits portion of its format and began airing sports full-time with NBC Sports Radio programming heard nights and weekends, and NBC Sports updates during the day.Genuine Austin Radio Tweaking Stations NBC Sports was later replaced with SB Nation Radio, based in Houston.

It is used to treat conditions in which there are low blood clotting factors (INR > 1.5) or low levels of other blood proteins. It may also be used as the replacement fluid in plasma exchange. Using ABO compatible plasma, while not required, may be recommended. Use as a volume expander is not recommended. It is given by slow injection into a vein. Side effects include nausea and itchiness. Rarely there may be allergic reactions, blood clots, or infections. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe for the baby. Greater care should be taken in people with protein S deficiency, IgA deficiency, or heart failure. Fresh frozen plasma is made up of a complex mixture of water, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins. When frozen it lasts about a year. Plasma first came into medical use during the Second World War. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom it costs about ¬£30 per unit. A number of other versions also exist including plasma frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy, cryoprecipitate reduced plasma, thawed plasma, and solvent detergent plasma. Definition In the United States it refers to the fluid portion of one unit of whole blood that has been centrifuged, separated, and frozen solid at or colder within eight hours of collection from whole blood donation or was otherwise collected via apheresis device. The phrase \\"FFP\\" is often used to mean any transfused plasma product. The other commonly transfused plasma, plasma frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy (PF24), has similar indications as those for FFP. PF24 has slightly lower levels of Factors V and VIII than FFP. PF24 is actually more commonly used than FFP in the United States. Medical uses There are few specific indications for FFP. These generally are limited to the treatment of deficiencies of coagulation proteins for which specific factor concentrates are unavailable or undesirable. A usual dose of plasma is 10‚Äì20 mL/kg recipient weight. Indications for the use of FFP include the following: *Replacement of isolated factor deficiencies FFP is used to treat rare bleeding disorders when specific factor concentrates are not available. FFP is the usual treatment for factor V deficiency. *Reversal of warfarin effect WarfarinPatients who are anticoagulated with warfarin are deficient in the functional vitamin K dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. These functional deficiencies can be reversed by the administration of vitamin K. For anticoagulated patients who are actively bleeding or who require emergency surgery, prothrombin complex concentrate (ideally, four factor PCCs) should be used if available. FFP/PF24/thawed plasma should only be used if more effective alternative treatments are not available. The ASA task force recommends starting with 5‚Äì8 mL/kg of FFP for warfarin reversal and rechecking laboratory values. *Use in antithrombin III deficiency FFP can be used as a source of antithrombin III in patients who are deficient of this inhibitor and are undergoing surgery or who require heparin for treatment of thrombosis. There are purified, human derived, as well as recombinant forms of antithrombin III available in the US. *Treatment of immunodeficiencies FFP is useful in infants with secondary immunodeficiency associated with severe protein-losing enteropathy and in whom total parenteral nutrition is ineffectual. FFP also can be used as a source of immunoglobulin for children and adults with humoral immunodeficiency. However, the development of a purified immune globulin for intravenous use (i.e., IVIG) largely has replaced fresh frozen plasma *Treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: Therapeutic plasma exchange with FFP/PF24 or thawed plasma as the replacement fluid is considered the treatment of choice for patients with proven or suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). FFP is not recommended unless there is ongoing bleeding or there is a significant blood clotting problem. That is, FFP is not used in people to reverse warfarin if there is no bleeding, even for an INR > 9 unless they need urgent surgery. It is also not used in elective surgery, or non-emergency surgery. Thawed plasma is made from FFP or PF24 and kept refrigerated (at 1‚Äì6 ¬∞C) after thawing can be stored for 5 days post thaw. Prophylactic plasma transfusions might have an effect for people that suffer from a blood clotting disorder and receive an invasive procedure. For people that suffer from a blood clotting disorder and receive a planned invasive non-cardiac procedure it is not certain if prophylactic plasma transfusions improve all-cause mortality up to 30 days, major bleeding within 24 hours, number of transfusions per participants within one week, number of individuals requiring a transfusion within one week and serious adverse events measured by plasma-related complications within 24 hours. Different triggers for fresh frozen plasma may have little to no effect on major bleeding within 24 hours and serious adverse events measured by plasma transfusion-related complications within 24 hours. Furthermore, different triggers for fresh frozen plasma may reduce the number of individuals requiring a transfusion within 7 days. Risks The risks of FFP include disease transmission, anaphylactoid reactions, and excessive intravascular volume (transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO)), as well as transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI). Risks of transfusion transmitted infections are similar to that of whole blood and red blood cells. Chemistry FFP is made by centrifugation of whole blood or apheresis device followed by freezing and preservation. Frequency of use The use of plasma and its products has evolved over a period of four decades. The use of FFP has increased tenfold in the United States from between the years 2000-2010 and has reached almost 2 million units annually. This trend may be attributable to multiple factors, possibly including decreased availability of whole blood due to widespread acceptance of the concept of component therapy. Alternatives Albumin Evidence indicates that other plasma components (e.g., single-donor plasma) that do not meet the criteria of FFP may have adequate levels of coagulation factors and are suitable for patients in whom FFP is indicated. Single-donor plasma is efficacious in the treatment of mild deficiencies of stable clotting factors. It also is of value in treatment of multiple deficiencies as in reversal of warfarin effects or in liver disease. Safe and effective alternative treatment often exists so that FFP is no longer the therapy of choice in many conditions. Cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrates should be used when fibrinogen is needed. For treatment of hemophilia A, recombinant factor VIII concentrates are available. For treatment of severe hemophilia B, recombinant factor IX concentrates are available. Crystalloid or colloid solutions such as human serum albumin or plasma protein fraction, are preferable to FFP for volume replacement. For nutritional support, amino acid solutions and dextrose are available.The most important alternative to the use of FFP is a comprehensive program of blood conservation. This includes measures such as intraoperative cell salvage and the realization that in many patients normovolemic anemia is not an indication for transfusion.

The terms palak paneer and saag paneer are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the United States and Canada. However, saag paneer is different from traditional palak paneer in that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach. Dhaba restaurants often specialize in palak paneer.  Preparation  Palak paneer is prepared by first boiling and pureeing spinach.The puree is then mixed with sauted tomatoes and onions. Grilled cubes of paneer are then added to the puree. Palak paneer is typically spiced with ginger, garlic, tomatoes, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder and cumin. Serving Palak paneer is served hot with a side such as roti, naan, paranthas, makki di roti, or boiled rice. It can also be served with onions on the side for a more traditional approach. In recent years, there have been fusion variations of palak paneer. In July 2020, a Bangalore-based food blogger posted her variation of palak paneer idli.

Biography  Muhammad Bassiri was born in a Sahrawi family in Tan-TanBiograf√≠a de Mohamed Basiri Desaparecidos.org (nowadays Southern Morocco, then part of the Cap Juby Spanish protectorate). In 1957 he left Tan-Tan for the newly independent Morocco to attend school in Marrakesh, and proceeded to study the Quran & Arabic in Cairo, Egypt and Journalism in Damascus, Syria, where he get in touch with the Panarabism ideology. On returning to Morocco in 1966, he founded Al-Shihab (The Torch), a Sahrawi nationalist newspaper. He also worked as a journalist in Casablanca. In March 1968 he was allowed to enter to Spanish Sahara (he had tried to enter on December 1967, but he was detained and expelled), because of the closing of the newspaper by Moroccan authorities in late 1967, and settled in the city of Smara as a Quranic teacher. It was there he started to organize the anti-colonial movement known as the movement of liberation (In Arabic: Harakat Tahrir) calling for end of Spanish occupation of the Sahara. Bassiri stressed non-violence (influenced by the peaceful struggle of Gandhi in the colonized India) and wanted to bring about change through democratic action, although the ruthless colonial rule imposed by Francisco Franco's Spain forced the Harakat Tahrir to remain clandestine. Bassiri didn't want a precipitated independence, but to negotiate with the Spanish authorities  Disappearance  On early June 17, 1970 the organization appeared openly in a peaceful demonstration against the Spanish colonial rule, asking for autonomy (as a first step to independence) and self- determination in the Zemla neighborhood of El-Aaiun, in parallel to an official Francoist demonstration. The Spanish governor-general of the colony, General Jos√© Mar√≠a P√©rez de Lema y Tejero, went to Zemla to discuss with the organizers of the demonstration, but did not reach an agreement to make them leave the place and join the official demonstration. Tensions escalated between the growing mass of Sahrawi protesters and the Spanish reservist soldiers, who were stoned-throwed after detaining 3 speakers of the protest, answered opening fire on the mass at 17:30 PM. Disturbance continued until 19:00 PM, when troops of the Tercio \\"Juan de Austria\\" of the Spanish Legion brutally put down what remained of the protesters. The events were seen by the Spanish authorities as a defiance to the official demonstration organized by the General governor, made to show the world the supposed Sahrawi support to the Spanish regime and refusal to the UN involvement. These events have been dubbed the Zemla Intifada by Sahrawis. Bassiri, who had abandoned Zemla before violence erupted, was informed of the events. He was offered to escape to Mauritania by car, but he refused it. According to Salem Lebser, he replied: \\"Nobody could say I'm an adventurer who has led people to death and then disappeared..I already fled once Morocco, where I felt like a stranger. But I would not fled from my own land\\". Bassiri was tracked down that night, detained around 03:00 AM of June 18, and jailed at El Aaiun Territorial Police headquarters. On June 19, and after being allegedly tortured, he testified before the Spanish military authorities.Declaraci√≥n de Mohamed Basiri ante la Polic√≠a Territorial, 19 de Junio de 1970 Desaparecidos.org A photograph of him registering before the \\"Habs Shargui\\" prison authorities is the last known trace of him. Later, he was allegedly moved to \\"Sidi Buya\\", the Spanish Legion headquarters in El Aaiun. According to testimonies given by three different persons to then apostolic prefect to Spanish Sahara F√©lix Erviti Barcelona, Bassiri was executed by a Spanish Legion patrol in the dunes surrounding El Aaiun on the night of 29 July 1970, although Spanish authorities of the time claimed that he had been expelled from the territory to Morocco on that date, moreover they also claimed later that Bassiri had entered Spanish Sahara illegally from Algeria in September 1970. Spanish colonial authorities even claimed in 1971 that Bassiri had died on the Skhirat coup d'√©tat against Hassan II. Present-day Sahrawi nationalists such as the Polisario Front honor him as the father of the modern Sahrawi independence struggle, as well as the first of the Sahrawi \\"disappeared\\" and a national martyr for the Liberty.

The same group of housing, from a bird's eye view. The Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) was a government organisation set up in 1927 by the British colonial government in Singapore (then the Straits Settlements) in response to the housing needs of the population of Singapore. At the time, many people resided in overcrowded shophouses and squatter settlements, resulting in widespread disease and lack of hygiene and sanitation. Often, over 200 people would live in one shophouse. That also generated massive civil unrest and crime. The SIT was formed with the recruitment of Captain Edwin Percy Richards as deputy chairman. The SIT was composed of professional architects and general contractors to resolve this large social problem, with the ultimate goal of building affordable public housing for the common population of Singapore. History The SIT was formally established by the Singapore Improvement Ordinance, 1927. The purpose of the ordinance (signed into law on 1 July 1927), was \\"to provide for the Improvement of the Town and Island of Singapore\\". The Ordinance was applied to both the town and island of Singapore except for areas occupied by the British military. Projects One of its earliest projects was the Tiong Bahru housing estate, which is regarded as the first public housing estate of Singapore. However, SIT managed to build 23,000 housing units in 32 years, unable to find an effective solution to the lack of housing as the population grew faster than it built housing units. Singapore's first satellite new town, Queenstown, was initiated by SIT in the 1950s but was mainly developed later by the HDB.

The population (including Brough) at the 2011 Census was 2,738. Collingham is located on the banks of the River Trent on the A1133 main road, just off the A46. It is approximately from Newark-on-Trent, from the city of Lincoln, and from the city of Nottingham. History Collingham is close to the old Roman Fort at Brough and there have been several local finds of Roman coins, jewellery and villa remains. It lies close to the Fosse Way on its way to Lincoln. The village name suggests a fairly early Saxon foundation, preceding the occupation of eastern England by the Danes and it is naturally mentioned in the Domesday Book. It is thought that the Great North Road crossed the Trent here before Newark was founded; prior to the river's change of channel westwards it ran close to the village and was the cause of much flooding. Many of the other villages close by have names which suggest that they were later daughter settlements. It possessed two churches in North and South Collingham from before the Norman conquest. The parishes extended from the river floodplain onto the uncultivated moorland on the higher ground between Trent and Witham, allowing for good grazing and meadowland throughout the year. In medieval and early modern times Collingham operated an openfield system and enclosure did not take place until the turn of the 18th/19th centuries, changing much local farming from a small holding of strips and the right to extensive grazing, to individual small cottage holdings or a precarious existence as a landless agricultural labourer. The wide square fields and relatively few isolated farms are the result. One field was set aside in the enclosure award of 1790 for lease every year with the revenues being put to the use of the poor of the parish. Around the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century there was an influx of agricultural labour, displaced from the enclosures of the upland Lincolnshire villages in places like Boothby Graffoe, Coleby and Harmston, taking the place of former Collingham people who had moved to towns such as Lincoln, Newark and Nottingham in search of better employment. During the siege of Newark in the English Civil War, the countryside was subject to deprivation from the opposing armies wanting food and fresh horses and the village suffered. In 1664, a mercer of Collingham, one Thomas Ridge, issued his own copper halfpenny tokens, in response to currency shortage after the civil war. In the 19th century Collingham was fairly self-sufficient with its own watchmaker, shoemakers, blacksmiths, dressmakers, schools, grocers and carriers. There were many local societies and the Nonconformist churches had their own congregations. At one point there was considerable enmity between the vicar of North Collingham and the rector of South Collingham with many disputes about the schools in the village. There are a large number of listed buildings in the village , from the c16 through to the c19, and the village is highly valued as a place to live and commute from. More information is available on the village's website Collingham Website Facilities The Co-op. Church of All Saints, North Collingham Church of St. John the Baptist, South Collingham Local amenities include the Co-op and One-Stop convenience stores, butcher's, general store, newsagent and post office. There is a medical centre/dentist/pharmacy complex which serves much of the surrounding area, plus a library in the same building. Now collectively known as Collingham Village Centre, negotiations are currently under way between Collingham Parish Council, Lincolnshire Co-operative, Collingham Football Club, and other interested parties, to build a new, much larger, Co-op supermarket, and a greatly enlarged car park. This will add another two to four retail outlets in the Village Centre, and is supported by the majority of the villagers who voted in a Parish Council survey. There are some sporting facilities in Collingham, notably Collingham F.C. and Collingham Cricket Club. There are also facilities for tennis, bowling and croquet while the nearby River Trent seems very popular with anglers. Collingham is fairly easy to get to by road or railway, being very close to the A46 and 5.5 miles from the A1/A46 junction at Newark-on-Trent. Collingham is served by the Nottingham-Lincoln railway line used by East Midlands Trains and you can reach most parts of the Midlands. There is an East Coast station at Newark Northgate from which London can be reached as well as all locations on the East Coast Main Line. A bus service to Newark operates on an irregular basis, with two daily buses running to Lincoln on a daily basis. Collingham has two main train stations and they are easy to get to. Many people cut through Collingham to get to Lincoln, Newark, Gainsborough ect. Bypass One ongoing issue affecting the village regards a bypass. The issue is not new, and has surfaced a number of times over the past sixty years or so, the last time being rejected in favour of another project in the county, a new bus station in Mansfield. The proposed bypass is not seen as a priority and in addition would damage the countryside and natural environment along the east side of the village.Many villagers pose the argument that the damage to the environment would be more than offset by the reduction in damage to the built environment along the High Street, and the cessation of the use of Low Street as a 'rat run' to avoid the traffic lights at the Station Road junction. Pressure groups within the village continue to campaign for the bypass to be built, regardless of how remote the possibility. Notable people The composer John Blow was born in the village. Two brothers from the village, John and William Bacon, took part in the Charge of the Light Brigade (under the assumed name of Baker). William was killed, but John returned, later leaving the Army. Both are buried in North Collingham churchyard. Drummer William Bowerman, formerly of I Was a Cub Scout and Brontide is from Collingham.

The town is at the most westerly crossing point of the river, with major road and rail links crossing it here. The population of the town at the 2011 census was 23,047. History The distinctive town name is derived from pen (meaning a hill), wort (meaning green) and ham (meaning settlement) with earlier names of Peneverdant and Pendrecham in 1200; Penwrtham in 1204; Penuertham in 1212; Penwortham 1260 and Penewrthamn in 1292.'Townships: Penwortham', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 6 (1911), pp. 56‚Äì61 accessed 17 October 2010. The motte of Penwortham Castle The town's history can be traced to pre-historic times with archaeological evidence showing that the ford at Middleforth was used to cross the Ribble. Penwortham was listed in the Domesday Book as \\"Penverdent\\". At the Norman conquest in 1066 the Barony was held by King Edward. In the 12th century Penwortham was the head of a barony held by Warine Bussel which included a large part of Leyland Hundred and manors in West Derby and Amounderness. Penwortham Castle, a motte-and-bailey castle was built during the post-Norman conquest period overlooking the Ribble and its ford by Roger of Poitou and served to guard the estuary and a ford crossing it. After Roger built Lancaster Castle, Penwortham declined in importance. Some evidence of this castle is still evident in St Mary's Churchyard but only the mound remains. In later centuries a manor house was built, but no evidence remains. The barony was acquired by Roger de Lacy in 1205, and descended as part of the Honour of Clitheroe to the Earls and Dukes of Lancaster and the Crown. In the 16th century there were disputes about suit and service due to the court of Penwortham from the members of the fee. Charles I sold the royal manor to Edward Ditchfield and others in 1628 and it later passed to the Faringtons of Worden in Leyland. Courts were held until the late 19th century. Court rolls and books are kept at Worden Hall. Penwortham Priory was built in the west of the town. Higher Penwortham has an old legend linked to it. The Fairy Funeral seen on the road through Penwortham Wood, was thought to forecast death. Penwortham Hall, formerly called \\"The Lodge\\", was built in 1801 by John Horrocks, founder of the Preston cotton-manufacturing industry. It was sold by his son Peter to William Marshall, whose son Frederick died in 1889. It was left by Frederick to his sister, the wife of Rev. T. Ross Finch. The property, which is a Grade II listed building, is today used as a series of private dwellings.\\"Penwortham Hall (incorporating Penwortham Lodge), Penwortham\\" at britishlistedbuildings.co.uk The parish was part of Preston Rural District throughout its existence from 1894 to 1974.Preston RD, Vision of Britain, accessed 9 June 2014 In 1974 the parish became part of the Borough of South Ribble. Demography Penwortham is one of the largest civil parishes by population in Lancashire, with a population of 23,436 recorded in the 2001 census. The town's development closely resembles that of Preston. Geography The Lower Penwortham area developed during the Victorian period which is evidenced by the large number of terrace housing along Leyland Road and the surrounding streets. Higher Penwortham is characterised by its 1920s and onwards, post-war semi-detached housing. The town includes the localities of Howick Cross and Middleforth, and the Kingsfold housing estate. In recent times there have been several new housing developments, especially around the Broad Oak Farm, Bee Lane, Kingsfold Drive, Stricklands Lane and Factory Lane areas of the town. Landmarks Penwortham Mill Penwortham Priory was built for the Rawsthorne family and redesigned by the Cumbrian architect George Webster. The priory was demolished due to the rapid expansion of the area and the need for new housing. Penwortham Church Lodge was originally situated on Penwortham Hill towards Preston, but as a consequence of widening the A59 road the lodge was taken down and removed to a residential road in Hutton. Penwortham Water Tower was built in the late 19th century and has been converted to a dwelling. It is part of a development of semi-detached cottages built for employees of the local squire, Lawrence Rawstorne.https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/73144 Education As well as a number of primary schools, the three high schools in Penwortham are All Hallows Catholic High School, Penwortham Girls' High School and Penwortham Priory Academy. All are situated in close proximity to Liverpool Road, in the centre of the town. Public services and amenities Penwortham has two supermarkets, a Sainsbury's which was converted from a Kwik Save in 2007, and a Booth's which opened on Liverpool Road in the mid-1960s and moved to Millbrook Way in the 1990s. There are three fish and chip shops. Penwortham Leisure Centre is part of Penwortham Priory Academy. It includes a 25-metre indoor swimming pool, gym and squash courts which are open to the general public. One of Lancashire's oldest charities, Galloway's Society for the Blind, established in 1867, has had its headquarters in Penwortham since 1950. The charity provides services to 6,500 blind and visually impaired people across Lancashire and beyond. Transport River Ribble from Penwortham Bridge The town has excellent transport links across the River Ribble. Liverpool Road leads into Preston via the \\"New Penwortham Bridge\\" of 1915. Penwortham Cop Lane railway station was on the West Lancashire Railway between Preston and Southport, until the line closed in 1964. The cutting which carried the railway under Cop Lane has been widened and now carries the A59 Penwortham bypass, known as Golden Way, which leads directly into Preston via the \\"Preston Flyover\\", which is now the main crossing over the river. Frequent bus routes serving Penwortham are provided by Preston Bus and Stagecoach and, until it ceased trading in October 2015, by John Fishwick & Sons. All services operate to and from Preston city centre.

Early life Dransfield was born in Sydney, and educated at Sydney Grammar School.Australian Poets and Their Works, by William Wilde, Oxford University Press, 1996 He briefly studied English literature and language at the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney before dropping out. He worked for some months as a clerk at the Australian Taxation Office before drifting into the counter-culture. From then on he worked intermittently, living mainly in Paddington, Balmain, and Darlinghurst in Sydney, and in the north coast town of Casino, and he travelled frequently between Tasmania and Queensland, visiting his large group of friends and fellow poets. Poetry Dransfield wrote his first poem at the age of eight and began to write regularly at fourteen. He was a prolific poet, writing lyrical poems, which as his career progressed came to focus more and more on drug experiences. His poetry was first published in the mid-1960s. Dransfield's poems were published in Meanjin, Southerly, Poetry Australia and Poetry magazine. His first published collection was Streets of the Long Voyage. He published two more books, including Drug poems (Sun Books, 1972). Between 1967 and 1969, Dransfield corresponded and exchanged poems with Peter Kocan, who had been imprisoned for attempting to assassinate federal opposition leader Arthur Calwell, and who was then a patient at the Morisset Mental Hospital in Morisset, New South Wales. The letters comprise drafts of poems by Dransfield, quotes of poems by other poets, and recommendations for books Kocan should read. =Themes= Dransfield's poems address \\"people marginalised by society\\" \\"the relationship of the creative self to the outside world\\"Michael Dransfield: a retrospective By Michael Dransfield, John Kinsella. p. xvii \\"personal identity, the family, the relationship between human beings and the natural world, poetry itself, and states of mind\\" Death In his early twenties Dransfield was plagued by ill health.

Legacy Rodney Hall, who as poetry editor of The Australian newspaper had been among the first to publish Dransfield's poetry, edited and posthumously published several collections of Dransfield's poetry during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including Collected Poems (UQP, 1987). In 2011 a poet character called \\"Michael\\" (evidently based on Dransfield) was featured in the second part of the ABC telemovie Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo. Several of Dransfield's poems were set to music by Paul Stanhope for mixed choir as Three Geography Songs in 1997. Other composers who have set his texts include Ross Edwards, Simon Reade, Paul-Antoni Bonetti, and Dan Walker.

It was created in early 2005 by Google engineer Chris Wetherell and launched on October 7, 2005, through Google Labs. Google Reader grew in popularity to support a number of programs which used it as a platform for serving news and information to people. Google closed Google Reader on July 1, 2013, citing declining use. History In early 2001, software engineer Chris Wetherell began a project he called \\"JavaCollect\\" that served as a news portal based on web feeds. After working at Google he began a similar project with a small team that launched an improved product on October 7, 2005, as Google Reader. In September 2006 Google announced a redesign for Reader that included new features such as unread counts, the ability to \\"mark all as read\\", a new folder-based navigation, and an expanded view so people could quickly scan over several items at once. This also marked the addition of a sharing feature, which allowed readers to publish interesting items for other people to see. In January 2007 Google added video content from YouTube and Google Video to Reader. In September 2007 product marketing manager Kevin Systrom (later, founder of Instagram) announced that Google Reader had graduated out of Google Labs. =Discontinuation= On March 13, 2013, Google announced they were discontinuing Google Reader, stating the product had a loyal but declining following, and they wanted to focus on fewer products. They gave users a sunset period until July 1, 2013, to move their data and suggested: \\"If you want to retain your Reader data, including subscriptions, you can do so through Google Takeout.\\" After the closure announcement, Feedly said that more than 500,000 new users had joined them in the following 48 hours, and 3 million in the following two weeks. In response to the planned closure, Digg also announced plans to build a Google Reader replacement, rebuilding its API and adding features to take advantage of the implicit recommendations of social network activity. Several petitions were started to keep Google Reader running, including one on Change.org with over 100,000 signatures. Instapaper developer Marco Arment speculated that the real reason for the closure was to try to keep everyone reading and sharing information using the now defunct Google+, and that it signaled the end of the era of unrestricted and interoperable web services like RSS from large organizations like Google, Facebook, and Twitter. Enthusiasts re-created a work-alike replacement called \\"The Old Reader.\\" Features =Interface= Reader's interface evolved several times from an early version, described by a Google designer who helped work on the revision as a \\"river\\" of news, to various experiences optimized for a wide range of devices, from browsers to the Wii video game console. In late 2008, Google Reader had a significant upgrade to its user experience and design. Led by Google designer Jenna Bilotta, the interface now included a cleaner visual style, collapsible navigation, \\"Friends\\" navigation, the ability to hide unread counts, and feed bundles. Some of the features of Google Reader in 2013 were: *a front page that let one see new items at a glance. *automatic marking of items as read as they scrolled past (expanded view only). *keyboard shortcuts for main functions. *choice between list view or expanded view for item viewing (showing either just the story title or including a description, respectively). *import and export subscription lists as an OPML file. *search in all feeds, across all updates from subscriptions. =Organization= Users could subscribe to feeds using either Google Reader's search function, or by entering in the exact URL of the RSS or Atom feed. New posts from those feeds were then shown on the left-hand side of the screen. One could then order that list by date or relevance. Items could also be organized with labels, as well as being able to create \\"Starred Items\\" for easy access. =Sharing= From 2007 to 2011, items in Google Reader could be shared with other Web users. Previously this was done by sending a link through e-mail, directing the user to the shared article; or by creating a basic webpage that includes all shared items from a user's account. In December 2007, Google changed the sharing policy so that items the user marked as shared were automatically visible to their Google Talk contacts. Users criticized this change because there was no way to opt out. Google removed the sharing functionality built into Reader in October 2011, and replaced it with a Google+ +1 button. Users criticized this change because it effectively dismantled existing social networks that used these features and disabled sharing and publishing functions that served as a communications medium for Iranians seeking news sources that couldn't be blocked by the government. The Google+ +1 button and count of how many people liked an article were removed in March 2013 shortly after the announcement that Google Reader would be discontinued. =Offline access= Google Reader was the first application to make use of Google Gears, a browser extension that let online applications work offline. Users who installed the extension could download up to 2000 items to be read offline. After coming back online, Google Reader updated the feeds. Google Reader stopped supporting this feature in June 2010. =Mobile access= A mobile interface was released on May 18, 2006. It could be used by devices that support XHTML or WAP 2.0. On May 12, 2008, Google announced a version of Google Reader targeted at iPhone users. in December 2010, Google released a Google Reader app for Android, available from the Android Market. =iGoogle= On May 4, 2006, Google released a new feature which enabled feeds from Reader to be displayed on iGoogle (formerly Google Personalized Homepage). =Play= In March 2010, Google announced and released Google Reader Play. Play presented a slideshow interface which displayed popular items one at a time. These items were drawn from assorted sites' feeds, and their appearance in Play was based on the data provided by Reader users' responses, e.g. how many people liked or shared the item. Unlike Google Reader, a Google Account was not required to access Play.

Some obstacles include: Gates, \\"fire\\" hydrants, safes (making it difficult to gain access to the gold), a rolling barrel, conveyor belts, and a swimming pool with platforms ranging in size and strength. When you collect all the gold in a given level, you must cash it into a building (labeled \\"out\\" when the level begins and \\"in\\" once you retrieve all the gold) to beat the level. The player can only hold ten bars of gold at once. In later levels there are more than 10 bars of gold, so the player must make multiple deposits. Levels The game has 4 maps.

He was a member of a Puerto Rican family of politicians, educators and writers.See: \\"Notable family members\\" section Early years Coll y Cuch√≠ was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. His father was Cayetano Coll y Toste, a historian who in 1913 was named the \\"Official Historian of Puerto Rico\\" and his mother Adela, was the daughter of Jos√© Cuch√≠ y Arnau former mayor of Arecibo. His family sent him to private schools for his primary and secondary education. El Nuevo Dia In 1896, Coll y Cuch√≠'s family sent him to Spain where he earned his degree in law from the University of Barcelona. During his stay in Spain, he became interested in politics and became involved with the Puerto Rico's independence movement. When Coll y Cuch√≠ returned to Puerto Rico, he found himself with a totally different political situation. The island, which once belonged to the Spanish Crown, was now a territory of the United States. This came about as part of the Treaty of Paris as a consequence of the outcome of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Politician In 1904, he joined the Puerto Rican Republican Party and was elected to the Puerto Rican Chamber of Delegates. Believing that Puerto Rico's identity as a nation was threatened by the Foraker Law, he decided to join the Puerto Rican Union Party headed by Antonio R. Barcel√≥ and was re- elected to the Chamber of Delegates in 1908. As member of the Chamber, he led the fight against the Foraker Law, also known as the Organic Act of 1900, which established a civilian government in the island. The new government had an American governor and executive council appointed by the President of the United States. By 1919, Coll y Cuch√≠ felt that the Union Party wasn't doing enough for the cause of Puerto Rico and together with some followers departed from the party and formed the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan. By the 1920s there were two other pro-independence organizations in the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association. The Independence Association was founded by Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a, Eugenio Font Su√°rez and Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920. Under Coll y Cuchi's presidency, the party was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislature Assembly to approve an act that would permit the transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances from Paris, France, to Puerto Rico. Betances' remains arrived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on August 5, 1920, and a funeral caravan organized by the Nationalist Association transferred the remains from the capital to the town of Cabo Rojo where his ashes were interred by his monument. Founding of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party On September 17, 1922, the three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Coll y Cuch√≠ was elected president, Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a (father of Ricardo Alegr√≠a) vice-president and Antonio V√©lez Alvarado \\"The Father of the Puerto Rican Flag\\" to the party's Supreme Counsel. In 1924 Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was named vice-president. In 1927, Coll y Cuch√≠ was invited to Columbia University to give a conference. At that conference the governor of New York Al Smith was present and congratulated Coll y Cuch√≠. When Smith ran for President of the U.S. in 1928, under the democratic ticket, he invited Coll y Cuch√≠ to come to the U.S. and campaign for him among the Hispanic communities, which he did. The Nationalist Party did poorly in the 1928 elections, they only received 399 votes out of a total of 253,520 votes.Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, By A. W. Maldonado, Pg. 86, Publisher: La Editorial, Universidad de Puerto Rico, (December 1, 2006), , Despite the fact that he was a leader in the independence movement, Coll y Cuch√≠ displayed respect and admiration towards the Americans. Albizu Campos did not like what he considered was Coll y Cuch√≠'s attitude of fraternal solidarity with the enemy. By 1930, there were more disagreements between Coll y Cuch√≠ and Albizu Campos as to how the party should be run. As a result, Coll y Cuch√≠ abandoned the party and some of his followers returned to the Union Party. On May 11, 1930, Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. In 1931, when President Herbert Hoover visited Puerto Rico, Coll y Cuch√≠ urged the islanders to greet him with a warm welcome. Notable family members Coll y Cuch√≠ came from a family of Puerto Rican educators, politicians and writers. His father Dr. Cayetano Coll y Toste (1850‚Äì1930), was a historian and writer.Biograf√≠as ‚Äì Cayetano Coll y Toste at www.zonai.com Nuevo Dia] His brother Cayetano Coll y Cuch√≠, was a President of Puerto Rico House of Representatives.

Some gold had been found in the canyons of the El Paso Mountains, enough to warrant an arrastra being built in 1887. In 1893 a nugget was brought in worth $1,900 from Goler Heights and so the rush began. In 1894 Eugene Garlock of Tehachapi moved in an eight stamp mill.

He produced film and TV scores in the 1970s, such as the Billy Jack soundtrack and music for Starsky and Hutch, and worked with Andr√© Previn's Trio in the 1990s. Career The son of a Baptist minister, Lowe grew up on a farm in Shady Grove, Mississippi, near Laurel. He started playing guitar when he was eight years old, with his father and sister acting as his first teachers. When he was thirteen, he began running away from home to play in bands. Occasionally his father would find him, bring him home, and warn him about the dangers of whiskey. At sixteen, Lowe worked in Nashville on the Grand Ole Opry radio program. He was a member of the Jan Savitt orchestra before serving in the military during World War II. At basic training, he became friends with John Hammond, who organized weekend jam sessions. He performed in an Army dance band while in Guadalcanal. After his discharge, he called Hammond, looking for work, and Hammond sent him to Ray McKinley. He spent two years with McKinley's big band in New York City. He joined the Benny Goodman orchestra, then worked intermittently for the next few years at Caf√© Society and other clubs in New York. In 1950, he was hired by NBC as a staff musician. He and Ed Shaughnessy were members of the Today Show band for over ten years. Lowe acted in an episode of the Armstrong Circle Theatre television show that included Walter Matthau and live music by Doc Severinsen. On the weekends he played jazz, sometimes getting permission from NBC to leave for six-month periods. In the jazz world he played with Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey, Bill Evans, Billie Holiday, Red Norvo, Charles Mingus, Charlie Parker, Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, and Lester Young. He composed and arranged for NBC. He was responsible for introducing pianist Bill Evans to record producer Orrin Keepnews, resulting in Evans's first recordings as a leader. In 1965 he moved to Los Angeles and worked for NBC as a staff guitarist, composer, and arranger. He wrote music for the TV shows Hawaii Five-O, Starsky & Hutch, and The Wild Wild West, and the movies Billy Jack and Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, But Were Afraid to Ask.

His research focused on the mutagenic effects of different forms of radiation on economically important plants like maize and barley.  Biography  Lewis John Stadler was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1896 to Henry Louis and Josephine Ehrman Stadler. Stadler's early education efforts were unremarkable, but two summers worked on Midwestern farms sparked an interest in agriculture. He began his undergraduate work at the University of Missouri and completed a B.S. in agriculture at the University of Florida (1917). Afterwards, he returned to the University of Missouri and earned the A.M. (1918). Post-A.M., he enrolled in the Field Artillery of the United States Army, although his commission as Second Lieutenant was not used in overseas duty due to the end of World War I. Stadler spent 1919 in graduate studies at Cornell University under Harry Houser Love and Rollins A. Emerson. He returned again to the University of Missouri and completed his PhD in 1922. Following graduation, he joined the University of Missouri Department of Field Crops faculty. Stadler remained at Missouri until 1954 and acted as a visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology (1940), and Yale University (1950). He simultaneously held an appointment with the U.S. Department of Agriculture beginning in 1930. Stadler completed presidential terms for several academic organizations, including Genetics Society of America, American Society of Naturalists, and Sigma Xi.Stadler, Lewis John (1896-1954), Papers, 1927-1955, C2429 at the State Historical Society of Missouri While Stadler spent almost his entire academic life at the University of Missouri he was also involved in external activities. During the 1930s Stadler participated in efforts to bring European scientists to the U.S. to escape Nazism. In 1948 Stadler was appointed a delegate to the Eighth International Congress of Genetics, which met in Stockholm. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture rejected his passport application and conducted a loyalty investigation; Stadler initially thought it was a State Department action. Stadler married Cornelia Field Tuckerman in 1919. They had six children: Maury, Henry, David, John, Eliot, and Joan. Although Stadler's initial research was on field plot technique and agronomy, his main research interest became genetics, concentrated upon the study of mutation in corn. In 1925, he won a National Research Council Fellowship in Biology for a study in variation in linkage values in maize. He did much work on the effects of X-ray treatments, and did comparative studies of mutation caused by X-rays and by ultraviolet rays. His work earned him an international reputation. He died of leukemia in 1954. In his honor, the University of Missouri holds the Stadler Genetics Symposium every two years.Stadler Genetics Symposium - University of Missouri References *Smocovitis, Vassiliki Betty. 2000.

A common application is for a plumber to determine the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes. Older sewer lines of small diameter, typically , are made by the union of a number of short sections. The pipe segments may be made of cast iron, with to sections, but are more often made of vitrified clay pipe (VCP), a ceramic material, in , & sections. Each iron or clay segment will have an enlargement (a \\"bell\\") on one end to receive the end of the adjacent segment. Roots from trees and vegetation may work into the joins between segments and can be forceful enough to break open a larger opening in terra cotta or corroded cast iron. Eventually a root ball will form that will impede the flow and this may cleaned out by a cutter mechanism or plumber's snake and subsequently inhibited by use of a chemical foam - a rooticide. With modern video equipment, the interior of the pipe may be inspected - this is a form of non-destructive testing. A small diameter collector pipe will typically have a cleanout access at the far end and will be several hundred feet long, terminating at a manhole. Additional collector pipes may discharge at this manhole and a pipe (perhaps of larger diameter) will carry the effluent to the next manhole, and so forth to a pump station or treatment plant. Without regular inspection of public sewers, a significant amount of waste may accumulate unnoticed until the system fails. In order to prevent resulting catastrophic events such as pipe bursts and raw sewage flooding onto city streets, municipalities usually conduct pipeline video inspections as a precautionary measure. Inspection equipment { align=center + Truck with fish, winch and cable, video pig, and downhole cable turn 180px 180px 180px Swiveling head detail 180px } =Service truck= The service truck contains a power supply in the form of a small generator, a small air-conditioned compartment containing video monitoring and recording equipment, and related computer and display for feature recording. =Cable and winch= At the back end of the truck is a powered reel with video cable reinforced with kevlar or steel wire braid. Some trucks also contain a powered winch that booms out from the truck allowing for lowering and retrieval of the inspection equipment from the pipeline. =Inspection camera= Sometimes referred to as a PIG (pipeline inspection gauge), the camera and lights are mounted in a swiveling head attached to a cylindrical body. The camera head can pan and tilt remotely. Integrated into the camera head are lighting devices, typically LEDs, for illuminating the pipeline. The camera is connected to display equipment via a long cable wound upon a winch. Some companies, such as Rausch Electronics USA, incorporate a series of lasers in the camera to accurately measure the pipe diameter and other data. Inspection process =Using a camera tractor= Tractor with motor and cradle for the inspection head A run to be inspected will either start from an access pipe leading at an angle down to the sewer and then run downstream to a manhole, or will run between manholes. The service truck is parked above the access point of the pipe. The camera tractor, with a flexible cable attached to the rear, is then lowered into the pipeline. The tractor is moved forward so that it is barely inside of the pipeline. A \\"down-hole roller\\" is set up between the camera tractor and the cable reel in the service truck, preventing cable damage from rubbing the top of the pipeline. The operator then retires to the inside of the truck and begins the inspection, remotely operating the camera tractor from the truck. When the inspection is complete or the camera cable is fully extended, the camera tractor is put in reverse gear and the cable is wound up simultaneously. When the camera tractor is near the original access point, the downhole roller is pulled up and the camera tractor is moved into the access point and pulled up to the service truck. A tractor may be used to inspect a complete blockage or collapse that would prevent using a fish and rope as described below. =Pulling the camera backwards= Semi- rigid fish may be pushed through the pipe to fetch a rope For small diameter pipes there may not be enough room for the tractor mechanism. Instead, a somewhat rigid \\"fish\\" is pushed through the pipe and attached to a rope at the access point near the truck. The fish is then pulled to place the rope along the pipe. The rope is then used to pull the inspection pig and cable through the pipe. Detaching the rope, the cable is then used to pull the pig backwards as the pipe is inspected on the monitor (this is the method shown in the illustrations below). Analysis of video footage { align=center  175px 175px 175px } Much of the analysis of what was viewed in the pipeline is conducted at the time of the inspection by the camera operator, but the entire inspection is always recorded and saved for review. Commercial software and hardware for video pipe inspection are available from a variety of vendors, including Cues, ITpipes, and WinCan. Conduit rehabilitation Depending mostly upon the change in conditions from a previous inspection various improvements may be made to the pipe. It may be cleaned with a rotating root cutting blade on the end of a segmented rotating chain, or a chemical foam may be applied to discourage root growth. If damage is found limited to only a few locations these may be excavated and repaired. Extensive moderate defects may be repaired by lining with a fabric liner that is pulled through the pipe, inflated, and then made rigid through chemical means. Severe damage may require excavation and replacement of the conduit.

The device was originally a standard platinum laboratory crucible with a perforated base into which asbestos pulp was placed to form the filter mat. The crucible was then heated in an oven to dry out until it attained constant weight. The use of these materials meant that after filtration, the crucible and its contents could be subjected to high temperature to dry the filtrate and possibly oxidize or ash it to minimum weight.

She first appeared in the 1978 film Superman: The Movie portrayed by actress Sarah Douglas. The character made her comic book debut in Action Comics #845 (January 2007). An adversary of the superhero Superman and accomplice of General Zod, she is typically depicted as having been imprisoned in the Phantom Zone along with Zod and Non. Character General Zod (Terence Stamp, center), Non (Jack O'Halloran), and Ursa (Sarah Douglas) in Superman II. Ursa is depicted in both films as a hater of any member of the male sex anywhere. The only exceptions to this prejudice appear to be Non and General Zod. In the first film, this aspect of her character is emphasized by Jor-El in his speech as he sentences them to the Phantom Zone. In the second film, as directed by Richard Lester, Ursa's male hating tendencies survive, but the reprise of Jor-El's speech emphasizes a different aspect of her character. In Lester's Superman II, Jor-El says \\"Ursa, the only feeling you showed was for your vicious general. Your only wish, to rule at his side.\\" Lester's inclusion of this material (shot by Donner) alters the character slightly, making her softer and, at least to a degree, in love with General Zod. In Superman II footage shot by Richard Donner, Ursa is more vicious and expresses her desire to kill as many men as she can in one scene from an extended TV version. During the moon scene, Ursa meets an astronaut. Ursa tears off his NASA patch, killing him. She then kicks him between the legs, sending him off into space. This one scene showcases how cruel and powerful Ursa is. In Donner's footage, Ursa does not necessarily appear to be in love with General Zod, but is with him because they share common goals. Throughout Superman II, Ursa collects symbols and badges as she encounters law enforcement and military officers on Earth, and she keeps these badges on her costume as symbols of those she has conquered or killed. She takes a NASA patch from an astronaut, a Sheriff's badge, a badge from a military officer's uniform at the White House, and several more badges and symbols that can be seen attached to her uniform as the film progresses. Comics Until 2006, the character of Ursa had never appeared in the Superman comic books, but a similar character, named Faora, made several appearances in the Pre-Crisis Superman comics. Faora was a Phantom Zone villain who first appeared in Action Comics #471 (May, 1977). Like Ursa, Faora hates all members of the male sex and was in fact sentenced to the Phantom Zone for \\"wantonly causing the death of 23 Kryptonian men in her own male concentration camp.\\" In JSA Classified #3, Power Girl (who was unsure about her true origins, at the time) was confronted by an escaped prisoner, from the Phantom Zone. He claimed that Power Girl's true identity, is Ursa, who had escaped the Zone with their help and promised to help the others escape. However, the prisoner was later revealed to be an illusion, created by the Psycho-Pirate. Action Comics #845 (January 2007), which is the second part of the \\"Last Son\\" arc by Geoff Johns & Richard Donner, finally introduced Ursa to the Superman comic book canon. This version of her contains elements similar to the originally released version of Superman II (even though Donner is co-writing this arc) where she is in love with Zod. Zod and Ursa are the parents of the Kryptonian boy that Superman and Lois Lane adopted. In a flashback in Action Comic Annual #10 a fleshed out retelling of the story told in Superman II partly aligned her story to her movie counterpart. Lover of General Zod, and part of the Kryptonian guard, she believed that Non and Jor-El were right about Krypton's final fate, and sought to rebel against the Council. When Non was kidnapped, lobotomized and turned into a brute with minimal intelligence and unable to speak, Zod and Ursa snapped, instigating open rebellion, while Jor-El surrendered to the Council, eventually using the Phantom Zone projector upon the trio during the trial seen in at has been the movie. Ursa stayed loyal to Zod, even in their \\"exile\\", and believing that Jor-El should have been able to save Krypton, or at least his lineage, agreed with Zod in pursuing and taking vengeance over the House of El. Ursa appears in another flashback alongside Zod in Action Comics #866. Here, she and Zod encounter Brainiac, who shrinks Kandor. During this encounter Brainiac killed the whole unit under Ursa's command. This paralyzes her with fear, changes her into the more vindictive person she is now. She runs a Black Ops squad that has been living on earth in secret. After Zod's attack on New Krypton she seem to be unable focus on her work and goes to Zod's side. Superman and even Non, lobotomized, seem to know her pain and seems to want to comfort her at this time. She is along with Superman or Commander El and Commander Gor now the leader of the Kryptonian military. Despite her initial, brief joy in motherhood, she still shows the brunt of her misandric belief on her son, Lor-Zod, who was abused on a regular basis on the account of his perceived weakness (due to his conception in the Phantom Zone, Lor ages in uncontrollable grow spurts and exhibits weaker powers than the rest of his race under a yellow sun). As a result, Ursa is now completely estranged from Lor, who arrived on Earth and was raised as Chris Kent‚Äîthe foster son of Clark Kent and his wife Lois Lane. Chris, upon returning to Earth one more time, openly defied his own legacy, mercilessly beating Ursa to save Thara Ak-Var, his current paramour. Ursa no longer considers Chris part of her family, and still resents Lois Lane for her bond with her estranged son.Action Comics #876 (April 2009) This version has developed a weakness to bright light and wears goggles. This apparently came about as a side-effect of being imprisoned in the Phantom Zone repeatedly. Following DC Rebirth, Ursa has been reintroduced in the new continuity as Zod's wife, along with their son Lor-Zod. After joining Henshaw's Superman Revenge Squad and making believe them to free his army, General Zod used the Phantom Zone projector to free them. Along with the Eradicator II, they fled to another planet, planning to create a New Krypton.Action Comics #984 (July 2017) Powers and abilities As a Kryptonian, Ursa derives her superhuman abilities from the yellow sun of Earth's solar system. Her basic abilities are high levels of superhuman strength, superhuman speed and superhuman stamina sufficient to bend steel in her bare hands, overpower a locomotive, outrun a speeding bullet and leap over a tall building in a single bound as well as heightened senses of hearing and sight including X-ray vision as well as telescopic and microscopic visions; virtual invulnerability; accelerated healing; longevity; heat vision; powerful freezing breath; and flight. Being female, her power levels are more akin to Supergirl and Wonder Woman. Similar to other Phantom Zone escapees, Ursa typically never experiences the full measure of her abilities as she is never given enough time to absorb and metabolite the yellow solar energy of Earth's sun before she is defeated and banished back to the Zone. As such, Ursa could prove more powerful than even Supergirl and possibly Wonder Woman as well due to her being a fully matured Kryptonian female while Supergirl is a later adolescent Kryptonian female and Wonder Woman is an Amazon. Her full strength would also make her a sufficient threat to Superman due to her combat prowess. Beyond just her superhuman strength and experienced hand-to-hand combat skills, Ursa is a ruthless killer who will do anything immoral to achieve her ends. She is fiercely loyal to General Zod and is willing to fight and die for his loyalty. Ursa is also a radical feminist with an extreme sociopathic hatred of males with the only apparent exception being General Zod and her Phantom Zone cohorts. This sentiment seems to extend to a lesser degree to her own son, Lor-Zod, as she willingly and gleefully stood by while Zod violently and physically abused the young boy. Like all Kryptonians, Ursa is vulnerable to Kryptonite and red solar radiation. Her virtual invulnerability does not provide protection from mind control or magic and can be overpowered and cause her to experience significant and even fatal injuries with significant force such as that of several atomic explosions or strikes from an opponent with superior strength and durability such as Doomsday. Her superhuman strength is inferior to the likes of Doomsday and her superhuman speed is inferior to Speedsters like the Flash. Her superhuman strength is limited due to her natural limits even while within the empowering light of Sol. In other media =Television= * Ursa appeared in the Superman (1988 Animated series) episode \\"The Hunter,\\" voiced by Ginny McSwain. Ursa was a criminal on the planet Krypton and was banished to the Phantom Zone for her crimes. Afterwards she and Faora assisted Zod when he sent the \\"hunter\\" to Metropolis to fight Superman. * A very similar character named Mala appeared in three episodes of Superman: The Animated Series. Seemingly based on both Ursa and Faora, she was played initially by Leslie Easterbrook and then by Sarah Douglas in her second and final appearance on the series. * Ursa can be seen as one of the many Phantom Zone prisoners attacking the Legion of Super Heroes. She is seen alongside General Zod. Drax, a character bearing a \\"Z\\" symbol similar to Superman's \\"S\\", mentions his parents throughout the episode (leading to speculation that Zod and Ursa are Drax's parents). * In the Smallville season 10 episode \\"Dominion\\", a character that may have been Ursa appears as one of General Zod's minions in the Phantom Zone. Toward the end of the episode, there is a scene that mirrors a scene in Superman II, which shows Zod, Non and Ursa stuck in the dimensional \\"glass,\\" as it's represented, and floating off into space. * Ursa appeared in the 2019 animated series DC Super Hero Girls, episode \\"#DCSuperHeroBoys\\" (Part 1 and 2), voiced by Tara Strong. She was sent to the Phantom Zone (along with Zod and Non) by Kara‚Äôs biological mother, Alura Zor-El. Upon escaping, she fights Flash and Batgirl, who gets angry for calling her \\"Ursula\\", until she is thrown back into the Phantom Zone being weakened with Kryptonite. =Film= * In the first Superman film, Ursa (played by Sarah Douglas) appears alongside General Zod and Non as they are being sentenced to eternal imprisonment in the Phantom Zone by Krypton's Ruling Council of Elders. The chief accuser is Superman's biological father Jor-El, who declares that Ursa's \\"perversions and unreasoning hatred of all mankind have threatened even the children of the planet Krypton.\\" Ursa, Zod, and Non are imprisoned in the Phantom Zone where they should remain for all eternity and are not heard from again in the first film. Once in the Phantom Zone, she desperately screams, \\"Forgive me!\\" repeatedly. * In the theatrical version of Superman II, Ursa, Zod, and Non are freed from the Phantom Zone when a hydrogen bomb thrown into space by Superman detonates near the Zone, shattering it. The three villains encounter a group of astronauts on Earth's moon. She meets an astronaut, asking him what sort of a creature he is. When he replies that he is a man, Ursa tries to tear the International Space Exploration emblem off his spacesuit. The astronaut attempts to get away, but Ursa flies around and cuts him off. She then rips the emblem off his suit, decompressing it and killing him. A pleased Ursa then sends him into space with a swift kick to his rear. Following the Lunar confrontation, Ursa and the villains make their way to Earth, which they believe is called \\"Houston\\", and proceed to lay waste to the small town of East Houston, Idaho. From there, they move to the White House, where the President of the United States (played by E.G. Marshall) is forced to kneel before Zod. When Ursa, Zod, and Non finally meet Superman, an epic battle sequence takes place in the streets of Metropolis, which ends when Ursa and Non throw a bus onto Superman and he flees the scene. Lex Luthor then tells the villains he knows where Superman has gone and suggests taking Lois Lane along because of her relationship with Superman. The villains are led to the Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic, where Ursa and Non threaten to tear Lois Lane in two if Superman does not kneel to General Zod. Superman attempts to trick the villains into a molecule chamber that will take away their powers but ends up being forced into it himself by Zod. However, Superman has actually tricked the villains: he reversed the effects of the molecule chamber so that its red sun radiation is beamed throughout the fortress while Superman remains protected inside the chamber. The villains are stripped of their powers and Ursa is last seen when Lois punches her, knocking her into a crevasse in the Fortress where she disappears into the mist. In extended versions of the film that have screened on television, Ursa has a slightly expanded role. She is seen ripping a badge off a military officer's uniform at the White House while remarking how peculiar it is that men wear ribbons and jewelry on this planet. She easily manages to defeat one man in a game of arm wrestling, knocking him unconscious, and when another of the men challenges her, General Zod throws him through the wall into the street. In one deleted scene, a boy in East Houston attempts to escape and get help, but Non rips the light from the top of a police car and throws it like an artillery round, killing the boy and his horse in the distance. A horrified woman remarks \\"He was only a boy!\\" to which, with obvious pleasure, Ursa replies, \\"Who will never become a man!\\" Also, in some extended versions, a powerless Ursa, Zod, and Non are seen being led into Arctic Police vehicles following the final confrontation at the Fortress. The theatrical version suggests that they are dead, as they are all seen falling into crevices inside the Fortress from which they never come out. * In Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut (a retooled 2006 version of the film as conceived by its original director, Richard Donner), Zod, Ursa and Non are released from their imprisonment when Superman redirects a nuclear missile headed for Hackensack, New Jersey into space. The resulting explosion destroys the Phantom Zone, freeing the criminals. At the end of the film, Superman uses a time warp to reverse all the damage Zod, Ursa, and Non had done to Earth, as well as re-imprisoning them back into the Phantom Zone, as Superman is totally against capital punishment under any circumstance. Unlike the slightly more campy portrayals in the Richard Lester cut of the film, the villains, including Ursa, in this version are portrayed as far more serious and menacing. =Video games= * Ursa appears in the DC Universe Online video game, voiced by Adrienne Mishler. * Ursa appears as a support card in the mobile version of Injustice: Gods Among Us. * In Injustice 2, Ursa makes a cameo appearance in Sub-Zero's character ending where she, Non, and General Zod are shown to have joined forces with the One Earth Regime's Superman who had been imprisoned in the Phantom Zone after the defeat of Brainiac. The Kryptonian villains and Superman manage to escape when Batman's Justice League accidentally create a portal to the Phantom Zone while trying to create a portal to Earthrealm for Sub-Zero. Sub-Zero feeling responsible for their escape joins forces with Batman's Justice League. In the ending, Ursa and Non are shown fighting with Batman while Supergirl clashes with General Zod, and Sub-Zero faces Superman. Additionally Supergirl also has two alternate color palettes called Fury of Ursa in reference to her.

It is comparable to a latte, but smaller in volume and with less microfoam, therefore having a higher proportion of coffee to milk, and milk that is more velvety in consistency ‚Äì allowing the espresso to dominate the flavour, while being supported by the milk. Description A flat white is generally served in a ceramic cup with saucer. Milk is frothed and foamy as it would be for a latte but held back to around of microfoam, creating a meniscus. Differences in the size of the foam layer differ between regions, with some preferring as little as 1mm. Key to the beverage is the crema being coaxed into the meniscus resulting in a uniform dark brown colour across the top of the beverage. Allowing the beverage to stand before drinking enhances the experience as the meniscus thickens and adds texture to each sip, resulting in distinct sip rings/tide marks as the beverage is consumed. According to a survey of industry commentators a flat white has several defining characteristics, chief among which is a thin layer of velvety microfoam (hence the ‚Äòflat‚Äô in flat white), as opposed to the significantly thicker layer of foam in a traditional cappuccino.  Origins  The earliest documented references to the beverage date back to Australia in the mid-1980s. A review of the Sydney caf√© Miller's Treat in May 1983 refers to their \\"flat white coffee\\".\\"Miller's Treat,\\" caf√© review, Liz Doyle and Brett Wright, Sydney Morning Herald, 6 May 1983 Another Sydney newspaper article in April 1984 satirised a vogue for caffe latte, stating that: \\"cafe latte translates as flat white.\\" \\"It's time to dare to be the same,\\" Jenny Tabakoff, Sydney Morning Herald, 16 April 1984 At Moors Espresso Bar in Sydney; Alan Preston added the beverage to his permanent menu in 1985. Preston claimed he had imported the idea to Sydney from his native Queensland, where cafes in the 1960s and 1970s had frequently offered ‚ÄúWhite Coffee ‚Äì flat‚Äú. Other documented references include the Parliament House cafeteria in Canberra putting up a sign in January 1985 saying \\"flat white only\\" during a seasonal problem with milk cows that prevented the milk froth from forming.\\"How Canberra lost its froth,\\" Milton Cockburn, Sydney Morning Herald, 10 January 1985 However, the origins of the flat white are contentious, with New Zealand also claiming its invention. The New Zealand claim originates in Auckland, New Zealand by Derek Townsend and Darrell Ahlers of Cafe DKD, as an alternative to the Italian latte, and a second New Zealand claim originates from Wellington as a result of a \\"failed cappuccino\\" at Bar Bodega on Willis St in 1989. Craig Miller, author of Coffee Houses of Wellington 1939 to 1979, claims to have prepared a flat white in Auckland in the mid-1980s.  Similar beverages  It is essentially the opposite of a \\"dry cappuccino\\", which has dry frothy foam but no liquid milk. A flat white has milk (or microfoam) but no froth. The milk should be velvety rather than fluffy and therefore stronger, which requires a shorter, ristretto espresso shot to avoid harsh flavours. The flat white is similar to an original Italian cappuccino, which is a single espresso with microfoam served in a cup. The Spanish caf√© con leche is similar, but uses scalded milk. In a flat white, the milk is steamed without frothing approximately to . Steaming the milk to this temperature retains the fats and proteins in the milk which retain a sweet flavour, lost when milk is steamed to scalding temperatures. A caf√© con leche also lacks the head of microfoam. The flat white and the latte are also similar, with some people incorrectly suggesting that the only difference between the two drinks is the vessel in which they are presented. In Australia a flat white is served in a ceramic mug, usually of the same volume () as a latte glass. However, some Australian caf√©s will top a latte with extra froth, while others may pour a flat white slightly shorter. New Zealand flat whites are more commonly served in a tulip shaped cup (). In both Australia and New Zealand, there is a generally accepted difference between lattes and flat whites in the ratio of milk to coffee and the consistency of the milk due to the way the milk is heated. Outside Australia and New Zealand The coffee style was exported to the United Kingdom by 2005, and by 2010 was being sold in Starbucks franchises there. By 2013 the flat white was available in Australian caf√©s in New York City, with Hugh Jackman co-owning one of them and endorsing the product. With the flat white becoming increasingly well known globally, very large coffee shop chains such as Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Caff√® Nero, Cafe Coffee Day, and Pret a Manger added flat whites to their menus. Starbucks debuted the flat white in American stores on 6 January 2015.

As the first Muslim governor of Lahore, he rebuilt and repopulated the city. He also added many important features, such as a masonry fort, which he built in the period of 1037-1040 on the ruins of the previous one, demolished in the fighting, and city gates (as recorded by Munshi Sujan Rae Bhandari, author of the Khulasatut Tawarikh (1596 C.E.).

On 15 August 1945, a reporter took note of a man's joyful expression and dance and asked him to do it again. The man consented and was caught on motion picture film in an Australian edition of the newsreel Movietone News. The film and stills from it have taken on iconic status in Australian history and culture, and symbolise joyous elation to war's end.  Identity  There has been much debate as to the identity of the dancing man. Frank McAlary, a retired barrister claims that he was the man photographed pirouetting in Elizabeth Street, Sydney, on 15 August 1945. A Queen's Counsel, Chester Porter, and a former Compensation Court judge, Barry Egan, both claim to have seen Mr. McAlary being filmed dancing.\\"Who is the dancing man?.\\" Macy, Richard. Sydney Morning Herald 8 December 2004 The television programme Where Are They Now?, produced by Australia's Seven Network, attempted to solve the mystery of the dancing man's identity. The network hired a forensic scientist who examined the film reel and picture and came to the conclusion that it was indeed McAlary. The Royal Australian Mint, however, chose to portray Ern Hill as the dancing man on a 2005 issue $1 coin commemorating 60 years since the World War II armistice. Mr. Hill has made a statement that, \\"The camera came along and I did a bit of a jump around.\\" The coin, sculpted by Wojciech Pietranik, does not bear any name. Rebecca Keenan of Film World Pty. Ltd., says the dancer may be Patrick Blackall. Mr. Blackall has claimed, \\"I'm the genuine dancing man,\\" and has signed statutory declarations that he is the man in the film. These remain not alone as many others maintain a claim to the moment, it is not conclusive and may never be. Frank A. Epton, a retired Chartered Accountant living in Alstonville, New South Wales before he died in February 2013, claimed that he was one of the soldiers in the background of the still image of the dancing man (the soldier without a hat).

As a child, he showed a strong interest in biology and natural history. He went to the \\"Hindenburgschule\\" in Berlin-Oberschoeneweide.Hagemann R: \\"Curt Stern 1902-1981. Drospophilagenetiker und Humangenetiker in Deutschland und den USA\\". Annals of History of Biology; 2006, Vol 11, 31-46. Supported by two high school teachers and his parents, he decided to study zoology. He entered the University of Berlin in 1920 at age 18. Stern conducted his doctoral studies at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, which was a one- to two-hour commute each way from his home. He chose the lab of Max Hartmann, a protozoologist, to study the reproduction of a protozoan of the order Heliozoa. In 1923 after only 3 years, he received a Ph.D. for the description of its mitosis, the youngest person to receive a Ph.D. from the university at that time. \\"To achieve his degree so early under these circumstances was an early, clear signal of the remarkable combination of high intellectual ability, photographic memory, and stamina that was to characterize his career.\\" Neel JV. \\"Curt Stern: August 30, 1902-October 23\\", 1981. Biogr Mem Natl Acad Sci. 1986; 56:443-73. Stern had read and critiqued a paper on the basis for crossing-over by Richard Goldschmidt, the 45-year-old director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology. Six months later Goldschmidt returned the critique to Stern without comment, called him into his office and offered him a post-graduate fellowship financed by the Rockefeller University at Columbia University, N.Y. to study genetics in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, the famous \\"Fly Room\\", so-named for the fruit fly Drosophila, the subject of genetic research for Morgan. Stern lived in New York City from 1924 to 1926. In 1926 his very first paper written in English was published in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.\\"An effect of temperature and age on crossing-over in the first chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster\\". Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1926, 12:530-32. After his fellowship, Stern returned to his alma mater, the University of Berlin, where he stayed for six very productive years from 1926-1932 as an investigator until he became a professor in 1928. There, he wrote the first two of his 5 books (Multiple Allelie, Handbuch der Vererbungswissenschaften, I. 147 pp. Berlin: Gebr. Borntraeger, 1930. and Faktorenkoppelung und Faktorenaustausch, 1933) and 35 papers. Most articles were about Drosophila genetics, but two hinted at areas he would pick up much later: one 1928 article delved into the topic of human genetics,Stern C. Welche Moeglichkeiten bieten die Ergebnisse der experimentellen Vererbungslehre dafuer, dass durch verschiedene Symptome charakterisierte Nervenkrankheiten auf gleicher erblicher Grundlage beruhen? Nervenarzt, 1928. 2:257-62. and another one from 1929 about mutagenic effects of radiation.Stern C. Erzeugung von Mutationen durch Roentgenstrahlen. Nat. Mus.1929:577-83. On October 29, 1931 Curt Stern married Evelyn Sommerfield, an American citizen, whom he had met 1925 at Columbia University. During 1932 he returned to the U.S. for a one-year fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, spent at the California Institute of Technology. He was in the company of geneticists Thomas Morgan, Alfred Henry Sturtevant, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Calvin Bridges, Rollins Adams Emerson, C.D. Darlington, Berwind P. Kaufmann, Drosophila geneticist Jack Schultz, and yeast geneticist Carl C. Lindegren. The year 1933 marks the year both of his last publication in German for 22 years to come, the year Hitler had come to power and Curt and Evelyn's decision to live in the US. Evelyn had returned to Germany to investigate in-person whether or not it was safe for him to return to Germany, seeking advice from his academic colleagues. The decision was forced by Hitler enacting an Aryan paragraph in April 1933 limiting public service to Aryans. After a temporary position at Case Western Reserve University in 1933, he accepted a research associate position at University of Rochester the same year, where he moved through the ranks to assistant professor in 1937, and then to associate professor from 1937 to 1941. He became an American citizen in 1939. Curt and Evelyn had three daughters: Hildegard (1935), Holly Elizabeth (1938), and Barbara Ellen. Stern had brought his parents to live with his family in what became a suburb of Rochester, Brighton, Monroe County, New York.1940 census per http://www.archives.com/1940-census/barned-stern-ny-62836509 accessdate 1-2-14 In 1941 Stern had become a full professor. From 1941 to 1947 he was chairman of the Department of Zoology and chairman of the Division of Biological Sciences. After 11 years in NY state, he left for Berkeley in 1947, age 45 to follow in the footsteps of his mentor Richard Golschmidt at the University of California at Berkeley where he had numerous doctoral students until his retirement in 1970. Curt Stern was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1970. His last public address was in 1973. Within 4 years his intellectual abilities had declined to such a degree, that he would not speak publicly anymore. He died of complications of Parkinson's disease, i.e. cardiac failure on October 23, 1981, in Sacramento, CA at the age of 79. Career In 1931, Stern was the first to demonstrate crossover of homologous chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster, only weeks after Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton had done so in maize (corn). In 1936, he demonstrated that recombination can also take place in mitosis resulting in somatic mosaics, organisms that contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissues. He later demonstrated that there were multiple genes on the Drosophila Y chromosome, and described the mechanism of dosage compensation. After World War II had begun, Stern fully entered the field of human genetics, supervising his first graduate student seminar in 1939, selecting \\"what little solid data existed\\", as explained by his former student Neel.Neel JV. Curt Stern: August 30, 1902-October 23, 1981. Biogr Mem Natl Acad Sci. 1986;56:443-73. Stern's seminar was a rational response to the perverted ideas of genetics feeding racist theories of national socialist movements racial hygiene, so prominent in Europe and the U.S. at that time, culminating in eugenics which had made it impossible for him to continue to live in Germany. During World War II, he led research for the American government on low-dose radiation safety, building on work he had started in Berlin. His laboratory group concluded that there is no \\"safe\\" threshold below which radiation is not harmful. Re-founding human genetics After the war, his research focused on human genetics, pioneering in what is now known as gene regulation. Although not a physician, he engaged in clinical work in human genetics. In 1943 he began teaching a course in human genetics to medical students at the University of Rochester. The first edition of Stern's pioneering textbook The Principles of Human Genetics was published in 1949, which he said in an autobiographical sketch from 1974 he wrote to feed the needs of premedical students. Both his teaching and his textbook were instrumental in re-founding human genetics on a non-racist basis, in sharp contrast with pre-war German and American traditions in the subject. Stern was a signatory of the 1950 UNESCO statement The Race Question, a statement by leading scientists in many fields, that questioned the validity and scientific foundations of racial theories and eugenics. Notably, Stern made the effort to translate his human genetics textbook into German, which became the first publication in his mother tongue after a 22-year hiatus of silence, and was published in 1955.Stren C. Grundlagen der menschlichen Erblehre. Goettingen: Muster-Schmidt Verlag. 1955. 560 pp. Only two more articles published in German language journals followed, besides the hundreds in English.Stern C. Wilhelm Weinberg zur hundert jahrigen Wiederkehr seines Geburtsjahres. Z. Konstit-Lehre, 1962 36:374-82. He must have continued to read German science books, as he reviewed them for Science for example.Stern C. Review of Die philosophischen Grundlagen der Naturwissenschaften, by M. Hartman. Science, 133:697. Commemoration The Curt Stern Award, established by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2001, recognizes a scientist who has made major scientific achievements in human genetics during the past 10 years.

The building is located on Park Row in Civic Center, Manhattan near New York City's City Hall and the Brooklyn Bridge. Its block borders Park Row, Pearl Street, and Police Plaza. 1PP replaced the NYPD's previous headquarters at 240 Centre Street, approximately north of 1 Police Plaza. Description Like Boston City Hall, One Police Plaza is rectangular in plan and is an inverted pyramid in elevation. It is a 13-level, horizontally-oriented brutalist building designed by Gruzen and Partners in 1973. A expansion project was completed in 2011. Although the project did not add any new floors to the building, it did add new computers and equipment. Angry Lower Manhattan residents held a rally on August 27, 2008 near One Police Plaza to protest the addition, and tenants of three neighboring co-ops filed a lawsuit to force the NYPD to undergo environmental and land use reviews. Located on the eighth floor of One Police Plaza is the Real Time Crime Center, an anti-crime computer network which is essentially a large search engine and data warehouse operated by detectives to assist officers in the field with their investigations. The Major Case Squad and the Technical Assistance Response Unit (TARU) are also located at 1PP. Inside 1 Police Plaza, a room on the second floor affectionately called \\"The Shack\\" serves as the police bureau office for local press outlets. Its tenants include the Associated Press, the Daily News, New York Post, The New York Times, Newsday, Staten Island Advance, El Diario La Prensa, NY1 News, and WINS Radio. Its police counterpart is on the 13th floor, the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Public Information (DCPI). Also inside 1PP is the \\"Fourteenth Floor\\", the NYPD commissioner's office. Park Row closure criticism Park Row, historically a major artery linking the Financial District to Chinatown and the Bowery, has been closed to civilian traffic since 2001. The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by the closure of the thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a chokehold on an entire neighborhood and that if One Police Plaza is such an obvious terrorist target, perhaps it should be moved from a residential area. Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition have been fighting the security perimeter around the building for years. Park Row reopened for use only by foot traffic and MTA buses in 2005, and those restrictions remain in place today. The NYPD has stated that it will not be moving despite the numerous complaints from residents, explaining that they had tried to alleviate the impact of the security measures by forbidding officers from parking in nearby public spaces and reopening a stairway that skirts the headquarter's south side and leads down to street level near the Brooklyn Bridge. The department also plans to redesign its guard booths and security barriers to make them more attractive, and is involved in efforts to convert two lanes of Park Row into a pedestrian green-way.

Career Born in Launceston, Tasmania, Cooley played 33 first-class games and three one-day games for the Australian state. With the bat he scored 291 runs in first-class cricket at an average of 9.38 with a top score of 32 not out. In one-day domestic cricket with the bat he never had to bat in his 3 matches that he played. With the ball in first-class cricket he took 54 wickets at 61.35 with a best of 4/41 and in one-day domestic cricket with the ball he took 4 wickets at an average of 21.25 with a best of 2/16. Coaching He took up coaching for the Tasmanian Tigers as at one time or another an assistant coach to the state team, the state's junior development officer, fitness advisor, pace bowling coach and under-17 coach. As the bowling coach for the England national team, he was considered instrumental in helping players such as Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison, Simon Jones, Matthew Hoggard and James Anderson amongst others improve their bowling, though the form of the latter after Cooley's intervention suggests otherwise. Following the lack of an offer from the ECB, he left his post at the end of his contract in December 2005, and in May 2006 became the bowling coach for the Australian national team. The England Cricket Board (ECB) was criticised for letting him move as he was seen as a key figure in England's 2005 Ashes success. Following England's loss of the first test in The Ashes in Australia in 2006, former England captain Tony Greig commented that England missed Cooley. After England had lost the fourth test, Cooley commented that the English side has lost its \\"intensity\\", and was surprised at the team bringing back injured players like Ashley Giles who had little recent form. At the end of the 2010‚Äì11 Ashes series, Cooley will become head coach of Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 3.4, this is one of the brightest stars in the constellation. The distance to this star has been determined directly using parallax measurements, yielding a value of around from the Sun.  Nomenclature  Œµ Cassiopeiae (Latinised to Epsilon Cassiopeiae) is the star's Bayer designation. The star bore the traditional name Segin, which probably originates from an erroneous transcription of Seginus, the traditional name for Gamma Bo√∂tis, which itself is of uncertain origin. Different sources report varying pronunciations, with SEG-in the most common but the variants SAY-gin and seg-EEN also appearing. In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Segin for this star on 5 September 2017 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names. While some published reports incorrectly claim that this star was designated by NASA as Navi ('Ivan', backwards), in honor of astronaut Virgil Ivan \\"Gus\\" Grissom, one of the three astronauts who died in the Apollo 1 accident, the actual star so designated is Gamma Cassiopeiae in the center of the constellation.

Properties Epsilon Cassiopeiae has a stellar classification of B3 V, indicating that it is a main sequence star fusing hydrogen in its core. Cote et al. (2003) indicate that it displays the spectral properties of a Be star, even though it is not categorized as such. The presence of emission lines in the spectrum indicates the presence of a circumstellar shell of gas that has been thrown off by the star. The outer atmosphere has an effective temperature of , giving it the blue-white hue of a B-type star. The interferometer-measured angular diameter is 0.43 milliarcseconds. At the estimated distance of this star, this yields a physical size of roughly 6 times the radius of the Sun. Observation during the Hipparcos mission suggest that the star may undergo weak periodic variability. The amplitude of this variation is 0.0025 in magnitude with a frequency of 11.17797 times per day, or one cycle every 2.15 hours. The signal-to-noise ratio for this measured variation is 4.978. Hipparcos measurements of the space velocity components for this star suggest that it is a member of the Cas-Tau group of co-moving stars, with a 93% likelihood. This group may be kinematically associated with the alpha Persei Cluster, indicating that the Cas-Tau group, including Epsilon Cassiopeiae, may have been separated from the cluster through tidal interactions.

The school also services the towns Harrington, Frederica, Viola, and Bowers. As of 2011, Lake Forest enrolled about 900 students. Athletics Lake Forest High School participates in athletics in the Henlopen Conference and is one of the smaller high schools based on enrollment, thereby competing in the Henlopen South. =Football= Lake Forest has a football tradition that dates back to the 1980s, when they won several conference championships. They also won the Division II state title in 1995. Lately the football program has not managed to live up to its tradition, but is hoping to turn around under Head Coach Freddie Johnson and his staff. Lake Forest High School has a long-standing football rivalry with Henlopen North rival Milford High School, the yearly Battle of the Bell, which began in 1969. In 2006 Lake Forest High School had to temporarily shut down their varsity football team due to allegations of the use of painkillers. Lake Forest forfeited their final three games for that season. Lake Forest leads the all-time series, just 20 to 19, but Milford has won 4 of the last 5, including a forfeit in 2006 and a 41-0 blowout on November 9, 2007 in the season finale. In 2008, starting only 4 seniors and 6 juniors, the very young spartan team improved to 3-7 and lost to Milford 28-14. Milford later made it to the state championship game. The Lake Forest Football team finished the 2009 season 7-3,in the annual Battle of the Bell the Spartans defeated rival Milford 26-0. Head Coach Freddie Johnson was named the Henlopen Conference Coach of the Year for the 2009 season. In 2010 the Lake Forest football team was crowned Southern Division champions. The Spartans finished 8-3, and suffered a one-point loss to Archmere in the state playoffs. Lake Forest Spartan senior Quadir Bryant was named the 2010 Delaware State Offensive Player of the Year. In 2011 and 2012 the Spartans finished 5-5, in 2013 the Spartans finished 6-4. The Spartans have extended their annual Battle of the Bell winning streak over rival Milford to 3 wins in a row. In 2014 the Lake Forest football team completed a perfect regular season 10-0, the second undefeated regular season in the school's history. The Spartans were crowned Southern Division Champs, and Head Coach Freddie Johnson was named the Henlopen Conference Coach of the Year for the 2014 football season. The Spartans dropped a tough first round loss in the state playoffs to Hodgson Vo- Tech 22-13. Hodgson Vo-tech went on to win the 2014 Division II State Championship 42-0 over the Laurel Bulldogs. Lake Forest Spartan senior John Flamer was awarded the 2014 Delaware State Defensive Player of the Year. The Spartans defeated Milford 40-13 in the Battle of the Bell. =Girls' basketball= Under the direction of first-year Head Coach Trenita Shields, the Lake Forest Spartans finished 16 - 4 and qualified for the DIAA State Tournament for the first time since 1992. The Lady Spartans won their first- round game (the first playoff win in school history) versus the Seaford Blue- Jays. The Spartans lost the second round to Sanford, who went on to win the 2014 DIAA State Championship. =Wrestling= In 2013-14, under the direction of Head Coach Mike Hansen, the Lake Forest wrestling team qualified for the 2014 DIAA State Dual Meet Championships. The Spartans defeated DMA in the first round and lost to Milford Buccaneers in the semi-finals, who went on to win the 2014 Division ll State Championship. In 2014-15 the Spartans again qualified for the 2015 DIAA State Dual Meet Championships and defeated Caravel Academy in the first round. Lake Forest again made it to the semi-finals of the State Team Duals only to lose to the Milford Buccaneers for the second year in a row. Spartan, Brian Thomson won the 2014-15 Delaware State Championships at 170lbs and John Flamer placed 3rd at 220lbs =Softball= The Lake Forest softball team has improved over previous years and were 12-6 in the 2015 season. They are hoping to create a winning tradition for many years to come. The softball team is coached by Ashlie Tatman and is assisted by Cassie Butler. The softball team won a state championship under the guidance of coach Al Wood in 1979. =Cross country= Lake Forest has a successful cross country team, with a record of 7 wins and 4 losses in the 2007 fall season. Though their top runners graduated in 2008, the girls' team still had a strong freshman base. In 2009 the girls' cross country team claimed a division title. In 2014 the boys' and girls' cross country teams finished 7-4 and claimed the Southern division title under first-year Head Coach Eric Payne. =Track & field= Lake Forest has a track tradition that dates back to the 1980s and 1990s, when they won several division, conference, and state championships. Head Coach Freddie Johnson has the Lake Forest track team in contention for division, conference and state championships every year. The boys' and girls' teams both received southern division championship titles in the 2007, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015 seasons. The boys' team won the Keith S. Burgess Invitational in 2010, 2014, and 2015.

It was developed by Beyond Software and published by SSI for the Amiga and DOS. Development When SSI began work on the Dark Sun game engine in 1989 after the completion of The Secret of the Silver Blades, they passed responsibility for continuing the Forgotten Realms Gold Box games to Beyond Software. SSI had planned to do only one more Gold Box game (Gateway to the Savage Frontier) before retiring the series in favor of the Dark Sun engine, but when Dark Sun was delayed and Gateway went to #1 on the charts they asked Beyond Software for a sequel. Designers Don Daglow, Mark Buchignani, Mark Manyen, and David Bunnett recognized that the Gold Box engine was past its prime and needed some kind of story or character enhancements to feel like a new game and not a tired sequel. Although they added many small enhancements to the game in addition to its all-new story, the largest feature was the first-ever option for either of two NPCs to fall in love with a player character. The sophisticated AI (for its time) tracked the player's actions in the game, much as the modern game Fable charts the player's actions as good or evil. If the player's actions matched the values of the NPC there was a chance they could fall in love. Plot overview Treasures of the Savage Frontier title screen A few weeks after the events of Gateway to the Savage Frontier, the mage Amelior Aminitas magically summons the party (by now called the \\"Heroes of Ascore\\") to eliminate the (apparently) last remaining troops of the Zhentarim from the dwarven city of Llorkh. Afterwards, the party is given a seemingly simple mission ‚Äì to protect ambassadors of the \\"Lord's Alliance\\", which holds together the different cities of the frontier. However, the ambassadors are kidnapped, the Zhentarim and its allies (the Kraken Society and the Hosttower of the Arcane) plot to break up the alliance to conquer the region, and the party is framed as traitors. Much of the game is devoted to having the players attempt to clear their names (usually done by completing a mission in each town of the Lord's Alliance) and alert the alliance's leaders of the plot. The final mission (which does not necessarily fit in the overall plotline) involves retrieving a treasure held by a dragon. To uncover the plot, the player has to collect two different sets of items: * Three different colors of crystals held by one of the three enemy groups (the Zhentarim, the Kraken, and the Hosttower). This can only be done by, in melee battles, carefully selecting and attacking different enemies in the right order. * \\"Lucky papers\\" from each city in the game. Nominally good luck charms, when combined with the crystals, these papers spell out the entire enemy plot. Gameplay Treasures of the Savage Frontier allows characters up to level 12. Depending on the player character's actions, certain non-player characters can fall in love with him. The game allows the option to utilize allied forces, which increases the number of combatants. The game's principal technical enhancement to the aging Gold Box engine is the addition of weather to wilderness play. Combat encounters in the snow restrict character movement and add variety to the game. Reception SSI sold 31,995 copies of Treasures of the Savage Frontier. It was reviewed in 1992 in Dragon #184 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Scorpia of Computer Gaming World in 1993 stated that the game was \\"a yawner\\" and \\"almost indistinguishable from\\" other Gold Box games\\". The One gave the Amiga version of Treasures of the Savage Frontier an overall score of 65%, stating that \\"While S.S.I.'s Eye of the Beholder series appeals to a large audience ...

The Twelve Years' Truce was the name given to the cessation of hostilities between the Habsburg rulers of Spain and the Southern Netherlands and the Dutch Republic as agreed in Antwerp on 9 April 1609 (coinciding with the Royal Decree of Expulsion of the Moriscos).Allen (2000) pp. 202‚Äì233. It was a watershed in the Eighty Years' War, marking the point from which the independence of the United Provinces received formal recognition by outside powers. For Spain the Truce was seen as a humiliating defeat as they were forced to make several sacrifices but they scarcely got anything in return.Goodman p. 15Anderson p. 4 For the time of its duration however the Truce allowed King Philip III and his favorite minister the Duke of Lerma to disengage from the conflict in the Low Countries and devote their energies to the internal problems of the Spanish Monarchy. The Archdukes Albert and Isabella used the years of the Truce to consolidate Habsburg rule and to implement the Counter-Reformation in the territories under their sovereignty. Context Stadtholder Maurice of Nassau by school of Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt. Ambrogio Spinola, marquis of Los Balbases, by Peter Paul Rubens. The war in the Low Countries reached a stalemate in the 1590s. After the fall of Antwerp in 1585, Spain's Philip II ordered Alexander Farnese to direct his military actions first towards the failed campaign of the Spanish Armada, then against France to prevent the succession of Henry IV, a Protestant. In the following years the Army of Flanders was entirely on the defensive. Unable to sustain the cost of a war on three fronts, Philip II was forced to declare a suspension of payments in 1596. Spain's predicament was adroitly used by Stadtholder Maurice. In a series of campaigns, the Republic's army surprised Breda in 1590, took Deventer, Hulst and Nijmegen the following year and captured Groningen in 1594. By that stage the Army of Flanders had lost almost all its strategic positions north of the great rivers.Parker (1977). After the accession of Philip III in Spain and of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella in the Habsburg Netherlands in 1598, the Army of Flanders tried to regain the offensive against the Dutch Republic. While it met with a tactical defeat in the Battle of Nieuwpoort on 2 July 1600, it did succeed in its strategic goal to repel the Dutch invasion of Flanders. The lengthy Siege of Ostend (1601‚Äì1604) amply demonstrated the balance of power. Both sides poured enormous resources into the besieging or defending a town that was reduced to rubble. Ambrogio Spinola, who had succeeded Archduke Albert as commander in the field, eventually captured the town on 22 September 1604, but only at the price of accepting the loss of Sluis. Meanwhile, Habsburg diplomacy had managed to disengage from two fronts. In 1598 Henry IV and Philip II had ended the Franco-Spanish War with the Peace of Vervins. Six years later, James I, Philip III and the Archdukes concluded the Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604) with the Treaty of London. Together, these treaties allowed the Habsburgs to concentrate their resources on the war against the Dutch in the hope of a knock out blow. The following year, Spinola seized the initiative, bringing the war north of the great rivers for the first time since 1594. Suddenly the Dutch Republic had the enemy threatening its heartland.Allen (2000). By 1606, the Spanish army had captured Oldenzaal, Lochem, Lingen, Rijnberk and Groenlo despite the efforts of Maurice of Nassau. They did not, however, keep the Republic's allies from continuing their material support. Moreover, Habsburg successes in the Low Countries came at a heavy price. The Spanish did not deliver their knock out blow they had hoped for.Israel (1995), pp. 399‚Äì405 Furthermore in 1605 the Dutch East India Company made serious inroads into the Portuguese spice trade, by setting up bases in the Moluccas.Israel (1982) pp. 5‚Äì9. These advances signaled a serious threat that the conflict might spread further in the Spanish overseas empire. On 9 November 1607 Philip III announced a suspension of payments. The balance of power had led to a balance of exhaustion. After decades of war, both sides were finally prepared to open negotiations. Conferences The Frisian Stadtholder Count William Louis by Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt. Father Jan Neyen by Peter Paul Rubens. The two opposing sides started putting out discrete overtures early in the campaign season of 1606. The contacts were intensified when Albert instructed Father Jan Neyen in March 1607 to seek out the preliminaries that would have to be met for formal negotiations. Raised a Protestant, Neyen had converted to Catholicism and joined the Franciscan Order. The move did not however seem to have cost him his longstanding access to Stadtholder Maurits, a fact that made him a valuable intermediary. Under the guise of visiting his mother in the United Provinces, Neyen travelled between Brussels and The Hague. The States-General of the Republic insisted on a preliminary recognition of their independence, to which Albert consented, be it with significant reservations.Van Eysinga (1959) pp. 79‚Äì83. On 12 April 1607 the United Provinces and the Habsburg Netherlands agreed to a ceasefire, valid for eight months and taking effect on 4 May. The ceasefire was later extended to include operations at sea.Van Eysinga (1959) pp. 83‚Äì84. Even then it was difficult to obtain the assent of Philip III. The king was appalled by Albert's readiness to concede on the point of independence. Only the desperate situation of Spain's finances compelled him to ratify the agreement. The ceasefire would be prolonged several times to allow for the negotiations that would eventually lead to the signing of the Twelve Years' Truce.Allen (2000) pp. 169‚Äì202. The peace conference opened in The Hague on 7 February 1608. The negotiations took place in the Binnenhof, in a room that has since been known as the Tr√™veszaal. As Stadtholder Maurits declined to take part in the conference, the leadership of the delegation of the Republic was given to his cousin William Louis of Nassau, the Stadtholder of Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe. The chief negotiator on the Dutch side was the influential Land's Advocate of Holland, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. The delegation of the Habsburg Netherlands was led by Ambrogio Spinola. Its leading participant was the Chief-President Jean Richardot. They were assisted by Neyen, the Secretary of State and War, Don Juan de Mancicidor, and the Audiencier Louis Verreycken. There was no separate delegation for the King of Spain. The delegates of the Archdukes were empowered to negotiate on his behalf.Groenveld (2009) pp. 41‚Äì42. President Pierre Jeannin, a posthumous engraving by Jacques Lubin. A number of princes sent delegations to the conference. The French team of mediators was led by the experienced negotiator and president of the Parliament of Burgundy, Pierre Jeannin. The English delegation was headed by the ambassador in The Hague and future Secretary of State Ralph Winwood. King Christian IV of Denmark sent his future Chancellor Jacob Ulfeldt. Other mediators represented the Palatinate, Brandenburg, Ansbach and Hesse-Kassel. The Elector of Cologne and the Duke of J√ºlich and Cleves sent observers. Most of these delegates left as the conference dragged out, with only the French and English mediators staying on until the end.Van Eysinga (1959) pp. 97‚Äì100. The conference failed to come to an agreement on the terms of a peace treaty and it broke up on 25 August. The parties were unable to compromise in matters of colonial trade and religion. To safeguard the Spanish Empire, the Habsburgs demanded that the Dutch would cease all navigation south of the Equator. It was a price that the mercantile United Provinces refused to pay. The demand inspired Hugo Grotius to publish his famous Mare Liberum in defense of the Dutch refusal.Borschberg (2011) pp. 78‚Äì81. The United Provinces likewise rejected the Habsburg demand that the Catholics in the Republic would be given freedom of religion as an interference in their domestic affairs. In spite of these setbacks, the French and English mediators nevertheless succeeded to convince the two sides to settle for a lengthy truce. It would preserve the peace, while remaining silent on all contentious subjects. After considering longer and shorter periods, the term of the Truce was set for twelve years.Groenveld (2009) pp. 41‚Äì52 Formal talks were resumed on 28 March 1609 at the Antwerp City Hall. On 9 April the two delegations set their signatures to the text.Allen (2000) pp. 202‚Äì233. The ratification process proved difficult. In the Republic, towns such as Amsterdam and Delft feared that the Truce would diminish their trade. The States of Zeeland resented the loss of income from privateering and insisted on maintaining the blockade of the Scheldt.Israel (1982) pp. 35‚Äì42. Philip III had his own reasons to relent. It took several missions from the Archducal Court before he was prepared to ratify the treaty on 7 July 1609.Allen (2000) pp. 229‚Äì230. Content The publication of the Twelve Years' Truce at Antwerp City Hall, by Michiel Collijn. The Habsburgs agreed to treat the United Provinces like an independent state for the duration of the Truce. The wording of the article was ambiguous. The Dutch version of the agreement stated more or less that the independence of the Republic had been recognized. The French text suggested that the Republic would be treated as if it were independent. All hostilities would cease for twelve years. The two parties would exercise their sovereignty in the territories that they controlled on the date on the agreement. Their armies would no longer levy contributions in enemy territory, all hostages would be set free. Privateering would be stopped, with both parties repressing acts of piracy against the other. Trade would resume between the former belligerents. Dutch tradesmen or mariners would be given the same protection in Spain and the Archducal Netherlands as enjoyed by Englishmen under the Treaty of London. This meant that they could not be prosecuted for their beliefs, unless they gave offense to the local population. For their part, the Dutch agreed to end the blockade of the Flemish coast, but refused to allow free navigation on the Scheldt. Exiles from the Southern Netherlands were allowed to return, but would have to conform to Catholicism. Estates that had been seized during the war would be restituted or their value would be compensated. A number of aristocratic families stood to gain from this article, with Stadtholder Maurits and his siblings foremost among them. The practicalities of the restitution were agreed upon in a separate treaty dated 7 January 1610.Groenveld (2009) pp. 59‚Äì66. The agreement was silent on the trade with the Indies. It did not endorse the Spanish claim to exclusive rights of navigation, nor did it back the Dutch thesis that it could trade or settle wherever there was no previous occupation by either the Spanish or the Portuguese. The Truce did not alleviate the situation of Catholics in the Republic or of Protestants in the Habsburg Netherlands. Although they were not actively persecuted, they could not profess their religion in public and remained excluded from public office. Consequences =Developments in the Dutch Republic= Arms adopted by the Dutch Republic to mark the recognition of their sovereignty after the Twelve Years' Truce. The immediate result for the Republic was that it was now officially recognised by other European states as a sovereign nation.Israel (1995), pp. 405‚Äì6 To mark the recognition of the independence of the United Provinces, the States-General added a closed crown with two arches to their arms.http://www.hubert-herald.nl/INHOUD.htm (in Dutch, consulted 29 April 2011). Soon after the Truce, the Dutch emissaries in Paris and London were accorded full ambassadorial status. The Republic established diplomatic ties with the Republic of Venice, the Moroccan sultans and the Ottoman Empire. A network of consuls was set up in the main ports. On 17 June 1609 France and England had signed a treaty, guaranteeing the independence of the Republic. To protect their interests in the Baltic, the United Provinces signed a defensive pact with the Hanseatic League in 1614 that was designed to protect them against Danish aggression.Israel (1998) pp. 405‚Äì406; Groenveld (2009) pp. 103‚Äì111. Batavia in 1627. The Truce did not halt Dutch colonial expansion. The United East India Company established its presence on the island of Solor,Borschberg (2011) p. 311n142. founded the town of Batavia on the island of Java and gained a foothold on the Coromandel Coast in Pulicat. In the New World, the Republic encouraged the colonization of New Netherland.Israel (1982) pp. 66‚Äì69. The Dutch merchant navy expanded rapidly, asserting itself on new routes, particularly in the Mediterranean. The official embargo on trade with the Americas had ended, but the colonists now imposed their own \\"unofficial\\" one, limiting Dutch trade with Caracas and the Amazon region. Temporary setbacks in the Indies caused the price of VOC shares on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange to fall from a high of 200 in 1608 to 132 after the Truce started. The Zeeland transit traffic to the Southern Netherlands declined sharply. On the other hand, the lifting of the Dutch blockade of Antwerp and the Flemish coast helped revive the trade in Flemish textile products, just as the Flemish textile industry experienced a revival itself.Israel (1995), pp. 409‚Äì10, 437 Despite the truce, in 1614 the Dutch Captain Joris van Spilbergen sailed beyond the Strait of Magellan with an expedition of five ships, and raided the Spanish settlements on the coast of Mexico and South America. He fought the Spanish at Callao, Acapulco and Navided.Quanchi, Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands, page 233Myers, Paul A., North to California, Llumina Press, 2004 In the Republic, ports profited from the expansion of trade. Brewing towns such as Delft or textile producing centers like Leiden and Gouda on the other hand, suffered from the competition of goods produced with cheaper wages in the Habsburg Netherlands.Israel (1982) pp. 56‚Äì59. Remonstrants and Counter-Remonstrants Johan van Oldenbarnevelt by Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt. During the Truce, two factions emerged in the Dutch Republic. The divisions separating them were religious as well as political. The unity of the Dutch Reformed Church was threatened by a controversy that found its origins in the opposing views of Jacobus Arminius and Franciscus Gomarus on predestination. Arminius' less rigid views appealed to the well-to-do merchants of Holland. They were also popular among the regents dominating the political life of that province, because they offered the prospect of an inclusive church controlled by the state. Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius were among the principal supporters. The strict interpretations of Gomarus stood for a church of the elect, independent of outside control. They appealed to the industrious strata of the manufacturing towns as well as to exiles from the Southern Netherlands who were excluded from political power, adding an element of social conflict to the controversy. In many towns congregations split between Remonstrants seeking to moderate the Belgic Confession, and Counter-Remonstrants who were strict Calvinists, insisting on its rigid interpretation. On 23 September 1617 Stadtholder Maurice of Orange openly sided with the Counter-Remonstrants. Maurice and many of the counter- Remonstrants had mixed feelings about the truce. Maurice was opposed to some of the measures of the truce and wanted full independence for the Dutch Republic. He favoured continuing the war until a total Spanish defeat that led to an unquestionable freedom for the Republic.Anderson p. 6 In an attempt to force the issue, Remonstrant regents used their sway over local authorities to recruit mercenaries with the \\"Sharp Resolution\\" of 4 August 1617, which authorised city governments to raise mercenary armies, the so-called waardgelders,This was a Dutch bastardization of the German word \\"Warte Gelt\\", or \\"retainer\\", and at the time was a general Dutch designation for \\"mercenary\\". outside the federal army or civic militias, to maintain public order. This drew an immediate protest from Maurice and from the other provinces on constitutional grounds. They asserted that the Union of Utrecht prohibited the raising of troops by individual cities without consent from the States General. Even more threatening to the federal supremacy had been the provision in the Sharp Resolution that asserted that units in the federal army paid for the account of Holland owed their primary allegiance to that province. This was a restatement of Holland's old constitutional position that the provinces were supremely sovereign, and the Union no more than a confederation of sovereign provinces. Maurice, and the other provinces (except Utrecht), now claimed that the States General possessed an overriding sovereignty in matters of common defence and foreign policyIsrael (1995), pp. 438‚Äì43 Maurice now mobilised the support of the five provinces opposing Holland and Utrecht for a States General resolution disbanding the waardgelders. This was voted through on 9 July 1618, with five votes to two, Holland and Utrecht opposing. Van Oldenbarnevelt and Grotius, in desperation, now overplayed their hand: appealing to the requirement for unanimity in the Union treaty, they sent a delegation to the federal troops in Utrecht (that were supposed to disarm the waardgelders in that city) with instructions that their first allegiance was to the province that paid them, and that they were to ignore instructions by the stadtholder in case of conflict. This intervention was construed by their opponents as treason. Prince MauriceHe had succeeded his half-brother Philip William as Prince of Orange, after the latter's death in February 1618 now brought up additional federal troops to Utrecht and started to disarm the waardgelders there on 31 July 1618. There was no resistance. The political opposition to his actions imploded as van Oldenbarnevelt's Utrecht ally, Gilles van Ledenberg, advocaat of the Utrecht States, fled to HollandIsrael (1995), pp. 443‚Äì8 On 29 August 1618 Maurice had Oldenbarnevelt and other leaders of the Remonstrants arrested and then proceeded to purge the Holland ridderschapCollege of Nobles; this was the co- opting college that represented the Holland nobles in the States, with one vote. and the vroedschappen of a number of cities that had been governed by Remonstrant regents up to then. He replaced the old regents with adherents of the Counter-Remonstrant faction, often nouveau riche merchants that had little experience in government affairs. These purges constituted a political revolution and ensured that his Orangist regime would be securely in charge of the Republic for the next 32 years. Henceforth the stadtholder, not the Advocate of Holland, would direct the affairs of the Republic, mainly through his parliamentary managers in the Holland ridderschap. The Holland leadership was emasculated by making sure that the position of Grand Pensionaryvan Oldenbarnevelt's title of Advocate was now abolished and replaced with this new title. would henceforth be filled by Orangists.Israel (1995), pp. 448‚Äì56, 458 Oldenbarnevelt was tried and executed. Others, such as Grotius, were imprisoned in Castle Loevestein. Meanwhile, the Synod of Dort upheld the strict interpretation of predestination and declared Arminianism heretical. Arminian theologians such as Johannes Wtenbogaert went into exile, where they set up a separate Remonstrant Church.Van Deursen (1974). =Developments in the Spanish monarchy= In Spain the truce was seen as a major humiliation ‚Äì she had suffered a political, military and ideological defeat and the affront to its prestige was immense.Perez 135 The agreement was not prestigious for the Spaniards as the Dutch emerged as the most favoured party.Lim pp. 77 Spanish councillors opposed renewing the truce in order to preserve Spain's reputation as a great power and renew the war. The terms of the 1609 truce that the Spanish found objectionable not only included the virtual recognition of Dutch independence but also the closure of the river Scheldt to traffic in and out of Antwerp, and the acceptance of Dutch commercial operations in the Spanish and Portuguese colonial maritime lanes. A defeat for Spain was essentially a defeat for Castile, for it was Castile which provided the policy and the maintenance of the empire. For the time of its duration however the Truce allowed Philip along with the Duke of Lerma to disengage from the conflict in the Low Countries and devote their energies to the internal problems of the Spanish Monarchy. Philip also longed to expunge the truce through a vigorous resumption of war. =Developments in the Archducal Netherlands= The Archducal Netherlands benefited from the Truce. Agriculture was at last allowed to recover from the devastation of war. The archducal regime encouraged the reclaiming of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the impoldering of the Moeren, a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian‚ÄìFrench border. The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population after decades of demographic losses. Repairing the damage to churches and other buildings helped to boost demand. Industry and in particular the luxury trades likewise underwent a recovery. Other sectors, such as textiles and breweries, benefited from relatively lower wages in comparison to the Dutch Republic. International trade was however hampered by the closure of the river Scheldt. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of canals linking Ostend via Bruges to the Scheldt in Ghent and joining the Meuse to the Rhine between Venlo and Rheinberg. In order to combat urban poverty, the government supported the creation of a network of Monti di Piet√† based on the Italian model. Meanwhile, the archducal regime ensured the triumph of the Counter Reformation in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. Under the terms of legislation passed shortly after the Truce, the remaining Protestant presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public. Engaging in religious debates was also forbidden by law. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechelen of 1607 were likewise given official sanction. Through such measures and by the appointment of a generation of able and committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the Catholic confessionalisation of the population. Resumption of hostilities More than once it looked as if the Truce was about to collapse. The succession crisis over the duchies of J√ºlich- Cleves-Berg resulted in severe tensions during the siege of J√ºlich of 1610 and the confrontations that led to the Treaty of Xanten in 1614.Anderson (1999) pp. 48‚Äì131 and 163‚Äì210. Petrus Peckius the Younger led a failed attempt at renewing the truce in 1621.

From the 1870s to 1890s, mining activity declined, and the population dropped to between 100 and 200. The mining industry was revived in the 1890s, and the population grew once again, with four hotels servicing the town. Much of the town had to be rebuilt following devastating bushfires in 1939. The Morning Star Mine continued operations until its closure in 1963. The Woods Point Magistrates' Court closed on 1 November 1981, not having been visited by a Magistrate since 1970. Location and features The town now serves as a hub for recreational trail- bike and off-road four-wheel drive activities and contains one hotel and one general store/petrol station (which has closed down), Mini Golf course, tennis court and many camping areas, the most popular being J. H. Scott Reserve. There are three gold mines still active in the area surrounding the town. The town is still only accessible by dirt roads. Woods Point was again severely threatened by bushfire in December 2006 and a 2008 bushfire calendar has been released with proceeds going to the town. The general store in Woods Point closed its doors in late 2010 and a smaller version opened down the main street, just over the bridge. This store facilitates small diesel fuel sales while the Commercial Hotel is covering the unleaded fuel sales. Plenty of fuel for motorbikes. Morning Star, a publicly listed company, was operating the Morning Star mine, as well as other nearby projects, until it was placed into receivership in 2015. Climate At an elevation of 680 m and latitude of 37¬∞ S, Woods Point holds one of the colder climates in Australia. Summer daytime temperatures are warm, but with very cool mornings; winters are cold and very wet, with regular snowfalls.

The normal fall in pressure is less than 10 mmHg. When the drop is more than 10 mmHg, it is referred to as pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus paradoxus is not related to pulse rate or heart rate, and it is not a paradoxical rise in systolic pressure. The normal variation of blood pressure during breathing/respiration is a decline in blood pressure during inhalation and an increase during exhalation. Pulsus paradoxus is a sign that is indicative of several conditions, including cardiac tamponade, chronic sleep apnea, croup, and obstructive lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD). The paradox in pulsus paradoxus is that, on physical examination, one can detect beats on cardiac auscultation during inspiration that cannot be palpated at the radial pulse. It results from an accentuated decrease of the blood pressure, which leads to the (radial) pulse not being palpable and may be accompanied by an increase in the jugular venous pressure height (Kussmaul's sign). As is usual with inspiration, the heart rate is slightly increased, Abstract due to decreased left ventricular output. Free Full Text. Mechanism During inspiration, the negative intra-thoracic pressure results in an increased right venous return, filling the right atrium more than during an exhalation. The increased blood volume dilates the right atrium, reducing the compliance of the left atrium due to their shared septum. Lower left atrial compliance reduces the left atrium venous return and as a consequence causes a reduction in left ventricular preload. This results in a reduction in left ventricular stroke volume, and will be noted as a reduction in systolic blood pressure in inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus is therefore an exaggeration or an increase in the fall of systolic BP beyond 10 mmHg during inspiration. Normally during inspiration, a person's systolic blood pressure decreases by ‚â§10 mmHg and heart rate slightly increases. This is because inspiration decreases intra-thoracic pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, which increases blood flow (systemic venous return) to the right atrium of the heart by reducing pressure on the veins, particularly the venae cavae. However, the decrease in intra-thoracic pressure and stretching of the lungs during inhalation also expands the compliant pulmonary vasculature so that blood pools in the lungs and decreases pulmonary venous return to the left atrium. Also, the increased systemic venous return to the right side of the heart expands the right heart and directly compromises filling of the left side of the heart by slightly bulging the septum to the left, reducing maximum volume. Reduced left-heart filling leads to a reduced stroke volume which manifests as a decrease in systolic blood pressure, leading to a faster heart rate due to the inhibition of the baroreceptor reflex, which stimulates sympathetic outflow to the heart. Under normal physiologic conditions the large pressure gradient between the right and left ventricles prevents the septum from bulging dramatically into the left ventricle during inspiration. However such bulging does occur during cardiac tamponade where pressure equalizes between all of the chambers of the heart. As the right ventricle receives more volume, it pushes the septum into the left ventricle further reducing its volume in turn. This additional loss of volume of the left ventricle that only occurs with equalization of the pressures (as in tamponade) allows for the further reduction in volume, so cardiac output is reduced, leading to a further decline in BP. However, in situations where the left ventricular pressure remains higher than the pericardial sac (most frequently from coexisting disease with an elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure), there is no pulsus paradoxus. Although one or both of these mechanisms may occur, a third may additionally contribute. The large negative intra-thoracic pressure increases the pressure across the wall of the left ventricle (increased transmural pressure, equivalent to [pressure within ventricle] - [pressure outside of ventricle]). This pressure gradient, resisting the contraction of the left ventricle, causes an increase in afterload. This results in a decrease in stroke volume, contributing to the decreased pulse pressure and increased heart rate as described above. Pulsus paradoxus occurs not only with severe cardiac tamponade, but also with asthma, obstructive sleep apnea and croup. The mechanism, at least with severe tamponade, is likely very similar to those of hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies (diastolic dysfunction), where a decrease in Left Ventricular (LV) filling corresponds to an increasingly reduced stroke volume. In other words, with these cardiomyopathies, as LV filling decreases, ejection fraction decreases directly, yet non-linearly and with a negative concavity (negative first and second derivatives). Similarly with tamponade, the degree of diastolic dysfunction is inversely proportional to the LV end-diastolic volume. So during inspiration, since LV filling is lesser relative to that during expiration, the diastolic dysfunction is also proportionally greater, so the systolic pressure drops >10 mmHg. This mechanism is also likely with pericarditis, where diastolic function is chastened. Measurement Pulse pressure (PP) is quantified using a blood pressure cuff and stethoscope (Korotkoff sounds), by measuring the variation of the systolic pressure during expiration and inspiration. To measure the pulsus paradoxus, place a blood pressure cuff on the patients arm and very slowly deflate the cuff while listening for brachial pulsations. Note the pressure that you first hear with pulsations during expiration (which will be the highest). Repeat the process, and record the pressure of pulsations heard during inspiration (which will be the lowest). If the pressure difference between the two readings is >10mmHg, it can be classified as pulsus paradoxus. Causes Pulsus paradoxus can be caused by several physiologic mechanisms. Anatomically, these can be grouped into: *cardiac causes, *pulmonary causes and *non-pulmonary and non-cardiac causes. Considered physiologically, PP is caused by: *decreased right heart functional reserve, e.g. myocardial infarction and tamponade, *right ventricular inflow or outflow obstruction, e.g. superior vena cava obstruction and pulmonary embolism, and *decreased blood to the left heart due to lung hyperinflation (e.g. asthma, COPD) and anaphylactic shock. =List of causes= Cardiac: *constrictive pericarditis.

These recaps were written with sarcastic criticism and opinion alongside a retelling of an episode's events, which the site referred to as \\"snark\\". Their official motto is \\"Spare the snark, spoil the networks,\\" a takeoff on \\"spare the rod, spoil the child\\" and its mascot is Tubeelzebub (a portmanteau of tube and Beelzebub ‚Äì \\"Tubey\\" for short), a devilish television set with horns and a pointed tail. Initially established in 1998 to recap the show Dawson's Creek, the site changed its name to Mighty Big TV when it expanded to other shows. It adopted the Television Without Pity name by 2002. The site was bought by the Bravo network within NBCUniversal in 2007, which continued to operate it until it was shuttered in April 2014. Sometime after this point, the site and branding was acquired by Tribune Media, who had announced plans in 2016 for a relaunch, but this was scrapped among other cost-cutting measures at Tribune in April 2017. The site's recap and forum archives remain available at the BrilliantButCancelled website. Television Without Pity is credited with popularizing the format of television episode recaps intermixed with running commentary. The site was also known to be used by television show producers, directors, and writers to gain more immediate feedback for their works and take in the constructive criticism for their future works. History The site began in late 1998 by Sarah D. Bunting and Tara Ariano, with technical support from David T. Cole, as an online forum-driven for the discussion of the show Dawson's Creek, then named DawsonsWrap. Their commentary specifically focused on the show's central character Dawson Leery, and Bunting said that this had caught their attention because \\"insidious, sexist, lazy writing had us apoplectic, not least because we're supposed to identify with a character who, on his best day, is an obnoxious, self-absorbed twit.\\" Their activities included writing recaps of each episode intermixed with their criticism, establishing the use of sarcastic criticism or \\"snark\\" within these recaps. Though they did not believe they had a direct impact on Dawson's Creek itself, they felt that by the end of the show's run, they had a seen a change in the show's writing that seemed to take their critics to heart. The DawsonsWrap format was popular, and by 1999, they expanded to include other shows with a similar approach, rebranding the site as Mighty Big TV. Around 2002, the site continued to expand and rebranded itself as Television Without Pity, providing the slogan \\"Spare the Snark, Spoil the Networks\\" In March 2007 the site was purchased by the Bravo unit of NBCUniversal for an undisclosed sum. Television Without Pity was expected to run independently under this acquisition, with Bunting and Ariano remaining in full editorial control of the site. Bravo had anticipated using the site's 2 million unique visitors at the time to enhance revenues from online advertising, recognizing that most visitors to Television Without Pity were devotees of one or more specific shows. A year after Bravo's acquisition, the founders Bunting, Ariano, and Cole all announced they were departing Television Without Pity. Around the same time, the site was redesigned and expanded to include features such as a wiki, videos, and a subsection \\"Movies without Pity\\". NBCUniversal announced on March 27, 2014 that it would close down Television Without Pity on April 4, with the forums remaining open until May 31; this closure was announced alongside that of DailyCandy, and a few months after closure of iVillage, both websites acquired through NBCUniversal and its subsidiaries. NBCUniversal had tried to shop the site around, and find ways to monetize its content better, but could not find a way to make the site viable in that then-current environment. Initially, the site's archives would have been stored electronically and not available to the public, but by demand, NBCUniversal affirmed it would make the recaps and archives of the forums available after the site's closure. The archives were eventually hosted under the Brilliant But Cancelled website. At some point following the site's closure, the Television Without Pity branding and website were acquired by Tribune Media. In a statement to The A.V. Club in April 2016, Tribune Media said they were in plans to relaunch the brand and were \\"working with some of the industry‚Äôs favorite talent, influencers and strategic partners on a relaunch\\". The Television Without Pity site was updated with a teaser image with Tubeelzebub and the text \\"Something wicked this way comes... returning in 2017\\". However, the relaunch plans were scrapped by Tribune Media April 2017, alongside other cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and shuttering of new editorial content at Screener. Show recaps and forums Recaps differ in styles: some of the recappers write shorter, more concise recaps while others write more comically, inserting references to their personal life, for example. Naturally, each style attracts different readers, with some preferring to use the site as information for episodes that they have missed, and others preferring the more humorous ones, which can be equally (or more) enjoyable to those who also watched the episode. Beginning in 2007, TWoP introduced \\"weecaps\\" ‚Äì initially presented as single-page television series reviews written in real time. The abbreviated recap style ‚Äì first used for coverage of The Real World/Road Rules Challenge and Dancing with the Stars during the spring ‚Äì was later employed for a larger slate of summer replacement series, with eventual reconfiguring into multi-page entries. Shows with weecaps also gain dedicated forums with topic areas as with regularly recapped shows. The American version of Survivor used weecap coverage for the start of its China season but full recaps returned with that edition's 7th episode and have remained in place since then. Shows canceled by the network (or deemed to be unpopular with the readers of TWoP) are considered to be in permanent hiatus, a status which is rarely reversed except for reality shows: the U.S. version of Big Brother returned to coverage in June 2006 when its All-Stars season began for the first time since its third season; Real World/Road Rules Challenge also returned to the active list in April 2007, with its recapping format switched to a shorter, real-time commentary; and while the site decided after the sixth edition of The Apprentice to stop recaps, the Celebrity Apprentice edition was brought back for coverage. Shows placed into permanent hiatus will generally have their forum threads readable but locked, and given a single dedicated thread in the appropriate miscellaneous forum categories; the recaps remain available on the site, though in the \\"Permanent hiatus\\" section. There are some exceptions; Doctor Who coverage was put into permanent hiatus after the 2nd season; Glark commented on the action of moving the show to permanent hiatus that \\"If you want to know what Bit Torrent is, ask a Doctor Who fan\\". The full Doctor Who threaded forum was retained though moved into the Sci-Fi show category, and remains fully active with moderation. As of now, the 2005 remake of Night Stalker holds the record for the shortest run on TWoP, having been put on Permanent Hiatus after only one recap, although the 2005 series Sex, Love & Secrets was expunged before even one recap, due to incredibly low viewer response in the forums. The shows covered are almost exclusively American, with the exceptions of the new series of Doctor Who, which is a British import to US television, and the original UK version of Queer as Folk, which was a British import to Canadian television. Both shows are Russell T Davies productions. At times, the site may offer a charity auction for \\"Tubey's Kids\\",‚Äì TWoP ‚Äì Tubey's Kids whereby the person with the largest donation can request a recap of a specific episode or show (no longer than one hour) by any specific recapper. The results of these recaps are posted as \\"Mondo Extras\\" on the site. The forum for each active show include threads for each episode of a show, a speculation thread, spoiler information, media references to the show, character/contestant-specific threads, and a general \\"meet market\\" for forum users. The forums are heavily moderated by staff to avoid significant off- topic discussion, unprotected spoiler information, and flame wars. Impact Television Without Pity was known to have established the use of recapping with commentary as a viable genre of criticism alongside a social space as to talk about shows. Television Without Pity predated the growth of social media, but through its forums established the social nature of watching television shows together. Sites like The A.V. Club grew from this type of approach, and social media is used heavily by television networks and fans alike to discuss shows as they occur in real time. Some television actors, directors, writers, and producers have been known to visit the website. The site's founders notably refer to a point in 2000 when The West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin posted in the forums, at one point upset over the snark in one of the show's recaps. His experience is believed to have inspired the episode \\"The U.S. Poet Laureate\\", in which a character posts on White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Lyman's fansite and is vehemently attacked by members of the forum for his beliefs and his violation of the forum rules. However, most others saw Television Without Pitys recaps and forums to be useful feedback. John Wells and J.J. Abrams have spoken to the value of Television Without Pity in developing their shows. Both CBS and The WB Network executives have used Television Without Pity to judge how to approach and market shows. Bravo's decision to buy Television Without Pity was based on the fact that if the site didn't exist, they would have made it themselves. For the past several years, posters at the site have organized \\"TARCon\\" in New York City which is a viewing party for the season finale of The Amazing Race. The party has been attended by many of the show's contestants from current and past seasons. Notable alumni During its height and after its closure, TWoP was a jumping-off point for writers about television and popular culture. The sites' founders started a new website, Previously.tv, that provided a similar style of recapping and forums, as well as writing for various media outlets. Jessica Morgan and Heather Cocks, co-founders of Go Fug Yourself, met while recapping for TWoP. Linda Holmes, host of the NPR podcast Pop Culture Happy Hour and editor of NPR's pop culture and entertainment blog (formerly known as Monkey See), got her writing start with recaps of The Amazing Race. Stephen Falk recapped several reality TV shows at TWoP as he was transiting from movie screenwriting to television, and since has become a producer for several television shows, including Orange is the New Black and Weeds, along with being the creator, writer and showrunner of You're the Worst.

The reservation was established in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868,Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington 1904. Vol. 2, p. 998 ff. and included all of present-day western South Dakota (commonly known as \\"West River\\" South Dakota) and modern Boyd County, Nebraska. This area was established by the United States as a reservation for the Teton Sioux, also known as the Lakota: the seven western bands of the \\"Seven Council Fires\\" (the Great Sioux Nation).  Reservation  In addition to the reservation dedicated to the Lakota, the Sioux reserved the right to hunt and travel in \\"unceded\\" territory in much of Wyoming and in the Sandhills and Panhandle of modern Nebraska. Because each band had its own territory, the US established several agencies through the Bureau of Indian Affairs to regulate the Lakota in this vast area. The United States used the Missouri River to form the eastern boundary of the Reservation, but some of the land within this area had already assigned to other tribes, such as the Ponca. The Lakota Nation considered the West River area central to their territory, as it had been since their discovery of the Paha Sapa (Black Hills) in 1765, and their domination of the area after they conquered and pushed out the Cheyenne in 1776. Paha Sapa was sacred to the Lakota, and they considered it their place of origin, thousands of years earlier. Custer's 1874 Black Hills Expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln (near Bismarck, Dakota Territory) to the Black Hills or Paha Sapa discovered gold. The public announcement brought miners and open conflict with the Lakota. The US Army defeated the Lakota in the Black Hills War. By a new treaty of 1877, the US took a strip of land along the western border of Dakota Territory wide, plus all land west of the Cheyenne and Belle Fourche Rivers, including all of the Black Hills in modern South Dakota. Most of the reservation remained intact for another 13 years.  General Allotment Act  In 1887, Congress passed the General Allotment Act, also called the Dawes Act to break up communal Indian lands into individual family holdings. On 2 March 1889, Congress passed another act (just months before North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted to the Union on 2 November 1889), which partitioned the Great Sioux Reservation, creating five smaller reservations: * Standing Rock Reservation (which included land in modern North Dakota which had not been part of the Great Sioux Reservation), with its agency at Fort Yates; * Cheyenne River Reservation, with its agency on the Missouri River near the Cheyenne River confluence (later moved to Eagle Butte following the construction of Oahe Reservoir); * Lower Brule Indian Reservation, with its agency near Fort Thompson; * Upper Brule or Rosebud Indian Reservation, with its agency near Mission, South Dakota; and * Pine Ridge Reservation (Oglala Sioux), with its agency at Pine Ridge, South Dakota near the Nebraska border. Neither the Crow Creek Reservation, east of the Missouri River in central South Dakota, nor the Fort Berthold Reservation, which straddles the Missouri River in western North Dakota, were part of the original Great Sioux Reservation. After the boundaries of these five reservations was established, the government opened up approximately 9 million acres (36,000 km2), one-half of the former Great Sioux Reservation, for public purchase for ranching and homesteading. Much of the area was not homesteaded until the 1910s, after the Enlarged Homestead Act increased allocations to for \\"semi-arid land\\".Raban, Bad Land, p. 23 Settlement was encouraged by the railroads, and the US government issued publications of scientific instruction (since found to be incorrect) on how to farm the arid land. New European immigrants came to the area. The Lakota tribes received $1.25 per acre, usually used to offset agency expenses in meeting federal treaty obligations to the tribes.  Dawes Allotment Act  By the Dawes Allotment Act, the federal government intended to break up the communal tribal lands in Indian Territory and other reservations and allocate portions to households to encourage subsistence farming on the European-American model. Federal registrars recorded tribal members in each tribe, as land was allotted to heads of households. (The Dawes Rolls have been used by some tribes as the basis of historic documentation of membership.) The government allocated 160 acre (1.3 km2) parcels to heads of families, and declared any remaining land to be \\"surplus\\" and available for sale to non-natives. After a period of time, Native Americans could sell their land individually, and did. The allotment of individual parcels and other measures reduced the total land in Indian ownership, while the government tried to force the people to convert to the lifestyles of subsistence farmers and craftsmen. The allocations were not based on accurate knowledge of whether the arid lands could support the small family farms envisioned by the government. This was largely an unsuccessful experiment for the Lakota and most homesteaders alike. Numerous European immigrants homesteaded the newly available lands on the Plains. Self-styled experts recommended regular tilling of the soil to \\"attract\\" moisture from the sky.Raban, Bad Land, pp. 30-36 The Plains were settled during what historians now know was a wetter than normal period and farmers had some early success. But, as more normal drought conditions returned, many farms folded. The farmers did not know how to best preserve the limited moisture in the soil, and farmers created the Dust Bowl conditions of the 1930s. Many had to abandon their land.Jonathan Raban, Bad Land: An American Romance, New York: Pantheon, 1996 Today most farming is done by large-scale industrial farms which use different techniques, such as winter planting, to raise wheat. By the 1960s, the five reservations had lost much of their territories, some through sales after the allotment process. In addition, the US seized land as part of federal water-control projects, such as construction of Lake Oahe and other mainstream reservoirs on the Missouri River as part of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. The Rosebud Reservation, which once included all of four counties and part of another, has been reduced to a single county: Todd County in south-central South Dakota, although much Indian-owned land remained in the other counties. Similar reductions occurred in the other reservations. Both inside and outside the reservation boundaries in West River, the Lakota are an integral part of the region and its history: many towns have Lakota names, such as Owanka, Wasta, and Oacoma. Towns such as Hot Springs, Timber Lake, and Spearfish are named in English after the original Lakota names. Some rivers and mountains retain Lakota names. The traditional Lakota game of buffalo and antelope graze together with cattle and sheep, and bison ranching is increasing on the Great Plains. Numerous monuments honor Lakota and European-American heroes and events. Land claims Although many non-Native homesteads were abandoned during the Dust Bowl-era of the 1930s, rather than reassigning the land to the Sioux, the federal government transferred much of the abandoned land to federal agencies; for instance, the National Park Service took over part of the modern National Grasslands and the Bureau of Land Management was assigned other land for management. In some cases, the US appropriated more land from the reduced reservations, as in the case of the WW2-era Badlands Bombing Range, taken from the Oglala Sioux of Pine Ridge. Although the range was declared surplus to USAF needs in the 1960s, it was transferred to the National Park Service rather than returned to the tribe's communal ownership. Considering the Black Hills sacred and illegally taken, in the 20th century, the Lakota pursued a claim against the US government for the return of the land. In the 1980 United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians the United States Supreme Court ruled that the land had been taken illegally, and the US government offered financial compensation in settlement. The Oglala Lakota are persisting in their demand to have the land returned to their nation; the account with their compensation is earning interest.

George Henry Bogert (February 6, 1864 ‚Äì December 13, 1944) was an American landscape painter. Life and work George Henry Bogert was born in New York City, the son of Henry Bogert and Helen Anderson Evans. His father was a paper manufacturer, and a noted collector of coins, medals, and writings on numismatics. As a student at the National Academy of Design and later under Thomas Eakins in New York City, he early on displayed the talent that later brought him fame. In 1884 he went to France and painted landscapes for a time at Grez, near the forest of Fontainebleau, afterwards going to Paris, where he studied under Colin, Aim√© Morot, and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes. Four years later he returned to New York and thereafter until his death was a frequent exhibitor at the Society of American Artists, the National Academy of Design, and elsewhere. In 1899, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. It was in 1901 that his landscape work began to attract attention. At the outset his achievements were tentative, but evidenced sincerity and promise. Within a few years it was evident that the artist was rapidly approaching the completeness that marks reflective work, and his paintings testified to the maturity of his style. In his summer journeys abroad he painted at √âtaples on the French coast with Eug√®ne Boudin and in the Netherlands and on the Isle of Wight. In these surroundings he found sympathetic material for many of his subsequent works. His compositions were said to preserve that truth in nature which represents true art and he became a profound synthesist, ever seeking to secure unity of ensemble and endeavoring to avoid striking a false note in his efforts to produce harmony of color and effect. His success in this direction is strikingly illustrated in his composition \\"Sea and Rain\\", and in many of his pictures the scope of his artistic vision is wide and comprehensive. A most prolific painter whose work found a ready and discriminating market. Bogert was exceedingly versatile, a characteristic that prevented him from having pronounced style. In 1911 an exhibit of his work was held at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and attracted widespread notice. His work is represented in the permanent collection of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, thanks to a gift from the New York merchant, George Hearn. In 1911 and 1914 he painted at the Old Lyme Art Colony in Old Lyme, Connecticut. In 1895 Bogert executed \\"The English Channel from St. Ives to Lelant\\", which was purchased by popular subscriptions in St. Louis and presented to the St. Louis Museum of Fine Arts. He won honorable mention at the Pennsylvanian Academy of Fine Arts in 1892; was awarded the Webb Prize at the exhibition of American artists in 1868 for \\"Evening, Honfleur\\"; received the 1899 First Hallgarten Prize from the National Academy of Design; won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900; was awarded silver medals at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904, and received gold medals from the American Society of Arts in 1902 and 1907. Bogerts work has been displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Gallery, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Huntington Library, Pennsylvania Academy, Brooklyn Museum, Edinburgh Museum in Scotland, Shanghai Club in China, Minneapolis Institute of Art, and others, also in private collections, including those of Andrew Carnegie, Clarence Mackay, and Thomas B. Clark. He married on June 2, 1865 Baltimore Maryland and gave birth to Margaret Austin Merryman, daughter of Joseph P. Merryman, and had two children: Austin (died in childhood), and Eleanor Bogert, who married Charles Bradford Welles. He died in New York City.

He is known for writing comic novels that often revolve around the dilemmas of British Jewish characters.Ragi, K. R., \\"Howard Jacobson's The Finkler Question as a Post-Holocaust Fiction\\", in Labyrinth: An International Refereed Journal of Postmodern Studies. July 2014, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 50-55. He is a Man Booker Prize winner. Early life Jacobson was born in Manchester and was brought up in Prestwich. He was educated at Stand Grammar School in Whitefield, Greater Manchester before going on to study English at Downing College, Cambridge, under F. R. Leavis. He graduated with a 2:2. He lectured for three years at the University of Sydney before returning to Britain to teach at Selwyn College, Cambridge. His later teaching posts included a period at Wolverhampton Polytechnic from 1974 to 1980.International who's who of authors and writers, London: Europa Publications, 2003, p.271 Career Jacobson's time at Wolverhampton was to form the basis of his first novel, Coming from Behind, a campus comedy about a failing polytechnic that plans to merge facilities with a local football club. The episode of teaching in a football stadium in the novel is, according to Jacobson in a 1985 BBC interview, the only portion of the novel based on a true incident. He also wrote a travel book in 1987, titled In the Land of Oz, which was researched during his time as a visiting academic in Sydney. Jacobson's fiction, particularly in the six novels he has published since 1998, is characterised chiefly by a discursive and humorous style Recurring subjects in his work include male‚Äìfemale relations and the Jewish experience in Britain in the mid- to late-20th century. He has been compared to prominent Jewish-American novelists such as Philip Roth, in particular for his habit of creating doppelg√§ngers of himself in his fiction. His 1999 novel The Mighty Walzer, about a teenage table tennis champion, won the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for comic writing. It is set in the Manchester of the 1950s and Jacobson, himself a table tennis fan in his teenage years, admits that there is more than an element of autobiography in it. His 2002 novel Who's Sorry Now? ‚Äì the central character of which is a Jewish luggage baron of South London ‚Äì and his 2006 novel Kalooki Nights were longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Jacobson described Kalooki Nights as \\"the most Jewish novel that has ever been written by anybody, anywhere\\". It won the 2007 JQ Wingate Prize.\\"Winner of the 2007 Wingate Literary Prize\\" As well as writing fiction, he also contributes a weekly column for The Independent newspaper as an op-ed writer. In recent times, he has, on several occasions, attacked anti-Israel boycotts, and for this reason has been labelled a \\"liberal Zionist\\". In October 2010 Jacobson won the Man Booker Prize for his novel The Finkler Question, which was the first comic novel to win the prize since Kingsley Amis's The Old Devils in 1986. The book, published by Bloomsbury, explores what it means to be Jewish today and is also about \\"love, loss and male friendship\\". Andrew Motion, the chair of the judges, said: \\"The Finkler Question is a marvellous book: very funny, of course, but also very clever, very sad and very subtle. It is all that it seems to be and much more than it seems to be. A completely worthy winner of this great prize.\\" His novel Zoo Time won the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize (2013), Jacobson's second time winning the prize (the first in 1999 for The Mighty Walzer). In September 2014, Jacobson's novel J was shortlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize. Jacobson has argued that an education in science and technology is more conducive to terrorism than an education in the arts and social sciences. Commentators on the article suggested that theology was an even stronger motivating force. Style Although Jacobson has described himself as \\"a Jewish Jane Austen\\" (in response to being described as \\"the English Philip Roth\\"), he also states, \\"I'm not by any means conventionally Jewish. I don't go to shul. What I feel is that I have a Jewish mind, I have a Jewish intelligence. I feel linked to previous Jewish minds of the past. I don't know what kind of trouble this gets somebody into, a disputatious mind. What a Jew is has been made by the experience of 5,000 years, that's what shapes the Jewish sense of humour, that's what shaped Jewish pugnacity or tenaciousness.\\" He maintains that \\"comedy is a very important part of what I do.\\" Broadcasting Jacobson has scripted television programmes including Channel 4's Howard Jacobson Takes on the Turner, in 2000, and The South Bank Show in 2002, which featured an edition entitled \\"Why the Novel Matters\\". An earlier profile went out in the series in 1999 and a television documentary entitled \\"My Son the Novelist\\" preceded it as part of the Arena series in 1985.\\"Arena: My Son the Novelist\\", BFI Film and TV Database His two non-fiction books ‚Äì Roots Schmoots: Journeys Among Jews (1993) and Seriously Funny: From the Ridiculous to the Sublime (1997) ‚Äì were turned into television series. Jacobson presented \\"Jesus The Jew\\", episode one of Christianity, A History, on the UK's Channel 4 in January 2009\\"Behold! The Jewish Jesus\\" by Howrd Jacobson, The Guardian, 8 January 2009 and in 2010 he presented \\"Creation\\", the first part of the Channel 4 series The Bible: A History. On 3 November 2010, Jacobson appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate (stop bashing Christians, Britain is becoming an anti-Christian country) in favour of the motion. In February 2011 Jacobson appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. His musical choices included works by J. S. Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Louis Armstrong as well as the rare 1964 single \\"Look at Me\\" by the Whirlwinds. His favourite was \\"You‚Äôre a Sweetheart\\" by Al Bowlly with Lew Stone and His Band. He wrote and presented the Australian biographical series Brilliant Creatures (2014) on four famous expatriate iconoclasts.Brilliant Creatures: Germaine, Clive, Barry & Bob Official website at ABC Personal life Jacobson has been married three times. Engaged at 21 whilst a student at Cambridge, he married his first wife Barbara in 1964 after graduating, when he was 22. They have a son, Conrad Jacobson, born December 1968. During his time at Cambridge, Barbara attended some of Leavis' seminars with Jacobson. Before leaving Cambridge they attended a party where amongst the guests were the playwright Simon Gray, and Germaine Greer, whose job Jacobson was filling in Sydney. In late 1964 Howard and Barbara emigrated to Australia, taking a six-week voyage on P&O;'s SS Oriana. On arrival, Jacobson took up a lectureship at Sydney University. They returned to Manchester in 1967, living there briefly before moving to London, where Conrad was born. This was followed by Howard teaching at Selwyn College, Cambridge, and running the family business on Cambridge Market selling handbags and leather goods. Jacobson returned to Australia when Conrad was 3 years old. He remained without a teaching post. Jacobson eventually returned to the UK after several years. Barbara divorced him in his absence. They share a granddaughter Ziva, born in 2008. He married his second wife, Rosalin Sadler, in 1978; they divorced in 2004. In 2005, Jacobson was married for the third time, to radio and TV documentary maker Jenny De Yong. He stated, \\"My last wife. I'm home, it's right\\". Politics In August 2014, Jacobson was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian urging Scots to vote against independence in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum. In November 2017, Jacobson joined Simon Sebag Montefiore and Simon Schama in writing a letter to The Times about their concern over antisemitism in the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, with particular reference to a growth in Anti-Zionism and its \\"antisemitic characteristics\\". Schama and Sebag Montefiore have both written historical works about Israel, while Jacobson has written regularly about Israel and the UK Jewish community in his newspaper columns. Jacobson made a further criticism of the party in July 2019, when he joined other leading Jewish figures in saying, in a letter to The Guardian, that the investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into the party in relation to antisemitism allegations was \\"a taint of international and historic shame\\" and that trust between the party and most British Jews was \\"fractured beyond repair\\".

The river is located about northwest of Cairns in the UNESCO World Heritagelisted Wet Tropics of Queensland. The area is now primarily a tourist attraction. Course and features The river rises on the slopes of the Great Dividing Range within the Daintree National Park below Black Mountain at an elevation of . The river flows in highly meandering course generally north, then east, then south and then east, through the rainforest where the water is fresh. At this convergence point, an abundance of wildlife congregate, particularly fish. The river is joined by two minor tributaries before flowing through the Cairns Marine Park through thick mangrove swamps where the water is highly saline; and then empties into the Coral Sea, north of . The mouth of the Daintree River opens onto a giant sandbar that shifts with each changing tide. The river descends over its course. The catchment area of the river occupies an of which an area of is composed of estuarine wetlands. =Flooding= The river is surrounded by mountains and deep valleys. Combined with the climatic conditions of the area the river is prone to quickly developing floods with little warning due to the high rainfalls on the mountain ranges around the catchment and the influence of the cyclonic forces in the adjacent Coral Sea. In March 1996, record flood levels swamped roads and properties throughout the Daintree region. Statistics gathered at the time recorded of rain falling in 24 hours. In 2011, two new causeways were completed over Cape Tribulation Road, making the drive mostly floodproof in all but the most severe rain events. In particular, the notorious bottleneck at Cooper Creek was raised . Attraction People are drawn to the area for its ancient vegetation, scenic surroundings and the vast array of native wildlife and plant species that inhabit the area. Currently, there is no bridge to enable crossing the river, so access is limited to the Daintree River Ferry, a commercial ferry that traverses the river for the purpose of tourism. Other features that surround the river include Black Mountain, Daintree Range, Thornton Peak and the Cape Tribulation Rainforest. The Daintree River is home to a dazzling array of tropical life. History =Indigenous history= The Kuku Yulanji is the indigenous people who once inhabited the regions surrounded by the Daintree River. The tribespeople were hunter-gatherers who lived in groups of eight to twelve, camping along the banks of the river and living on a staple diet that included a selection of bush tucker harvested from the vegetation from the forest surrounding the Daintree. It has been estimated that the tribe resided on the banks of the Daintree river for over 9,000 years. =European history= Due to the ever-shifting deep centre of the sandbar, entering the Daintree River has always been a problem for ship captains. The area was missed by Captain Cook when passing in the voyage where his ship was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef. The Daintree River was first seen by Europeans in 1873 after they were attracted to nearby regions due to its vast natural reserves of gold. George Elphinstone Dalrymple, the Queensland Gold Commissioner on the Gilbert gold field at that time, was the first European to visit the river and he named the river in honour of Richard Daintree, an English geologist and the Agent-General for Queensland in London. The Daintree was rated second to the Proserpine River, as the river in Queensland where people were most likely to spot a saltwater crocodile from 2000 to 2012, with 145 sightings recorded over the period. World Heritage listing Confluent of tributary (foreground) and the Daintree (background) The Wet Tropics of Queensland was given UNESCO World Heritage listing, inclusive of the Daintree River in recognition of \\"its outstanding natural universal value as an outstanding example representing; the major stages of Earth's evolutionary history, significant ongoing ecological and biological processes, superlative natural phenomena and as containing important and significant habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity. The river is part of the much larger Daintree Rainforest, region in Northern Queensland encompassing . Flora and fauna Female crocodile in the Daintree River The river and its surroundings are home to some of the most primitive forms of animal and plant life in the world. The surrounding mountains and valleys provided protection from the forces to adapt to climate change by sheltering several species of plants. A notable example is the primitive She-oak Gymnostoma australianum. This pine-like tree is the only remaining species in the Gymnostoma group of plants in Australia, and is now restricted to very isolated pockets north of the Daintree River. The genus was once widespread throughout Gondwana, and its relatives are still found in parts of the Pacific and south-east Asia. Of the five species of ringtail possum found in north Queensland rainforests, the Cinereus ringtail possum (Pseudochirulus cinereus) is almost wholly restricted to the Daintree catchment. Within the park, this species is found only in upland rainforest on Thornton Peak and the upper reaches of the Daintree and Mossman Rivers. Once considered a light-coloured form of the Herbert River ringtail possum, commonly found throughout the Atherton Tablelands, it was described as a distinct species in 1989. Black and white Striped possums (Dactylopsila trivirgata) are quite common throughout the park, particularly in the coastal lowlands north of the Daintree River, although to see one while spotlighting requires a mixture of luck and know-how. Due to the river's isolation, saltwater crocodiles - once threatened in the region due to hunting - have flourished in recent years, beneficiaries of legislation that protects them. There have been numerous reports of deaths in the Daintree River from crocodile attacks. Authorities warn tourists and visitors not to step close to the riverbank, and stay within the confines of boats, and absolutely never swim in the river.

The town is south of Inverell and north-north-east of Sydney. Tingha is an Aboriginal word for \\"flat or level\\". History Before non indigenous settlement the area now known as Tingha was mainly lived upon by people from the Nucoorilma clan of the Gamilaroi Nation, which is an associated group of the Murri Aboriginal people. Many of their descendants still live in the surrounding area. Tingha was first settled in 1841 by Sydney Hudson Darby and became a mining town after tin was discovered there in the 1870s.\\"Armidale, Guyra, Uralla, Walcha\\", June 2007 Within a year Australia‚Äôs first commercial tin mines were operating at a private settlement known as Armidale Crossing. Around 5,000 people arrived and about 1000 of the miners were Chinese. The Wing Hing Long Museum is a reminder of that heritage, being established in the 1880s as a general store by Chinese storekeeper, Ah Lin. Armidale Crossing Post Office opened on 1 September 1872 and was renamed Tingha the next month. The village was proclaimed a town in 1885. Initially there were enough readily accessible surface deposits to make a good living without using machinery as Chinese people did. The first school was established by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1890. In the 1890s drought came to the district and the easily obtained deposits of tin were exhausted leading to a loss in population.Readers Digest Guide to Australian Places, Readers Digest, Sydney By the early 1900s the mining boom was over and Tingha's population had dwindled to just a few hundred people. Shortly after this, large companies moved into the area to mine the less accessible tin. The town was serviced by the Bundarra & Tingha Advocate newspaper, published in Bundarra, from 1900 to 1932. It was also serviced by the Tingha Advocate and North-Western Journal, published in Tingha, from 1916 to 1932.

Zwilling became prominent in the Wittenberg reform movement in mid-1521, when Luther was secured in the Wartburg after the Diet of Worms. Along with Carlstadt, Zwilling guided the Wittenberg movement in a more radical direction. In January 1522 he participated in iconoclasm in Wittenberg. When Luther returned to Wittenberg and regained control in March 1522, Zwilling publicly admitted his errors, and gave his support to Luther's more conservative vision of reform. He became a prediger (‚Äúpreacher‚Äù) in Altenburg in 1522, and moved to Torgau in 1523 where he became successively prediger, pastor (1525), and superintendent (1529). He married the widow, of the former councilor and chancellor of Frederick III. the Hieronymus Rudelauf (about 1450-1523) from Frankenberg. The couple had a son Paul Zwilling (1547-1581).

Its ideology was a mixture of nationalism, individualism, and social conservatism. It is sometimes considered to be a fascist (or at least crypto-fascist) group, although the group itself did not see itself in this light. History The New Zealand Legion was a successor to the New Zealand National Movement, which had been founded by a group of people dissatisfied with the United-Reform coalition government, who broke away soon after 1930. The group included John Ormond, a former Independent Reform candidate influenced by Albert Davy (although Davy himself did not join the Legion). In particular, the government was accused of adopting \\"socialist\\" policies to combat the Depression, and of attempting to appease left-wingers rather than resist them. The New Zealand Legion presented itself as an alternative solution to the Depression, winning support from conservatives who believed that action was necessary but who rejected the socialist approach. The Legion reached its height in late 1933, when it is believed to have had around 20,000 members. Much of its support came from smaller provincial towns, particularly in the Hawkes Bay area. The Legion had little in the way of organisation, however, and rarely set out any detailed programs. By the end of 1934, the Legion had dwindled away to virtually nothing. Ideology The New Zealand Legion used a number of themes in its campaigning. One was nationalism, with the Legion arguing for greater self-reliance (particularly from Britain) and national unity. Another was individualism -- harshly critical of \\"state paternalism\\", the Legion promoted what it saw as the right of people to be free from (and if necessary, to resist) government interference in their affairs. There were also calls for greater public morality and self-sacrifice \\"for the sake of the country\\". Although the Legion was involved in politics, it did not see itself as a political party, and professed itself opposed to the party system. Some, particularly on the left, accused the Legion of being a fascist organisation, but this is a contentious claim. In particular, the Legion's belief in individualism is pointed out as contrary to fascist principle. After the Legion's eventual demise, Robert Campbell Begg, its one-time leader, was approached by the Nazis while on a world trip, but is reported to have found their philosophy \\"absurd\\".M.C.Pugh: \\"The New Zealand Legion (1932-1935): New Zealand Journal of History (April 1971)Matthew Cunningham: \\"Conservative Protest or Conservative Radicalism?

It thus takes the place of the torse. Garter stall plate of Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle. Shield, helm and crest of Edward, the Black Prince, from his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral. Between the lion crest and the helm is a cap of maintenance, now almost entirely decayed. A cap of maintenance, known in heraldic language as a chapeau gules turned up ermine, is a ceremonial cap of crimson velvet lined with ermine, which is worn or carried by certain persons as a sign of nobility or special honour. It is worn with the high part to the fore, the tapering tail behind. It may substitute for the torse in the heraldic achievement of a person of special honour granted the privilege by the monarch. It thus appears in such cases on top of the helm and below the crest. It does not, however, feature in the present royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, which shows the royal crest upon the royal crown, itself upon the royal helmet.Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.2, Royal Arms Origins The origin of this symbol of dignity is obscure. One might speculate that the origin relates to the Old French verb maintenir ‚Äì \\"to hold\\" or \\"to keep\\". A purpose of the cap was to keep a crown or coronet secure (and comfortable) on the head, thus its function was simply to \\"maintain\\" the coronet in place. The granting of the cap as an honour might refer specifically to the red velvet and/or ermine trim, distinct from a simpler design of cap. Royal insignia According to the Oxford English Dictionary a cap of maintenance was granted by the pope to both Kings Henry VII and to his son King Henry VIII as a mark of special privilege. A cap of maintenance is one of the insignia of the British sovereign, and is carried directly before the monarch at the State Opening of Parliament, nowadays usually by the Leader of the House of Lords. Kings of the United Kingdom wear a cap of maintenance at their coronation, prior to the anointing, as seen most recently at the Coronation of King George VI: it is worn for the journey to Westminster Abbey, for the Procession inside the Abbey and then when seated in the Chair of Estate during the first part of the coronation service. Queens regnant do not wear them on such occasions, but wear instead a diadem, as in the case of Queen Elizabeth II who wore the George IV State Diadem before her coronation. Lining of peer's coronet In more general terms, the velvet and ermine lining of a crown (or of the coronet of a peer) is itself sometimes called a 'cap of maintenance', and is technically a separate item from the crown itself. It may have had a purely practical origin being used to help a crown fit more firmly or to protect the head from bare metal on the crown. As peers' coronets are displayed affront√©, or facing forward, the only visible parts are the front of the ermine trim and the velvet top (with a gold tassel) - the ermine tails would be invisible. Confusion with 'Muscovy hat' A number of English cities and towns refer to the use of a 'cap of maintenance' as worn by a ceremonial officer, most usually a swordbearer. These are based most often on a design worn by the swordbearer of the Lord Mayor of the City of London. However, this item is called by the City of London authorities a \\"Muscovy hat\\" and is a historic reference to the mediaeval trade with the Baltic. The Muscovy hat served as the crest of the City of London until replaced in the nineteenth century by the present crest of A dragon's wing charged with the Cross of St George. The confusion as to nomenclature stems from references in early borough charters granting the right to the use of a ceremonial sword which often mentioned in addition the right to a cap of maintenance. However, this was intended to mean that in civic processions a cap of maintenance should be carried along with the sword (and mace), signifying that the mayor was the sovereign's representative. The correct form of use can be seen at the State Opening of Parliament, where it is carried alongside the Sword of State in front of the monarch. It would be quite improper for a commoner to actually wear it. Variants In many English towns where the privilege of a sword was granted by the Crown (for example York, Bristol, Coventry, Lincoln, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Worcester, Hereford, Exeter and HullCeremonial Costume by Alan Mansfield. London: A & C Black, 1980.) the swordbearer wears a variant of the City of London Muscovy Hat, although some wear other sorts of eccentric headgear which they mistakenly also call a \\"cap of maintenance\\". However, the 'grant' is a grant of arms and a heraldic charge rather than an actual object. City of York usage Arms of the City of York, with quasi-cap of maintenance reversed from usual heraldic orientation. The City of York claims to possess an original medieval cap of maintenance, which is kept and displayed in the Mansion House; whatever its origin, it is in fact a \\"Bycocket\\" or \\"Robin Hood\\" style of cap with ermine trimmings forming into a split peak at the back and was copied from an heraldic drawing and not from a genuine cap of maintenance. Caps of this style are still worn by the York Swordbearers. The City of York claims the grant of a cap of maintenance from the Yorkist King Richard III (1483‚Äì1485)The Mansion House, York, website claims this as a grant from King Richard II in 1393‚Äîalmost 90 years earlier than Richard III; see The Mansion House, YorkThe History of York website, also claims this as a grant from King Richard II in 1393‚Äîalmost 90 years earlier than Richard III; see York's coat of arms and incorporates this into its coat of arms as a quasi-crest but reverses it so that the tail or peak faces to dexter (viewer's left), thus further compounding the confusion.

He wrote for the Toronto Star from 1962 until his death in 1992. Biography Lautens was born on November 3, 1928, in Fort William, Ontario, to Joe and Bertha Lautens. The family relocated to Hamilton where his father, a Canadian Press employee for 50 years, was a teletype operator and mechanic servicing CP machines in the area from an office in the Hamilton Spectator. Lautens began working for the Spectator after school and in the summers when he was just 13 years old. After graduating from Central Collegiate Institute in 1946, Lautens went on to study history at McMaster University where he was the editor of the campus newspaper The Silhouette from 1948 to 1950. On graduation Lautens joined the Spectator as a reporter in 1950. He became a sports columnist in 1954 and later served as the paper's assistant sports editor. Fans of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats once burned Lautens in effigy after he had written something unflattering about the team in the newspaper. He met his wife, Jackie, in 1957 when she was a contestant and he was a judge in the annual \\"Miss Tigercat\\" pageant. Together they had three children: Richard, Stephen and Jane. Toronto Star Building In 1962, Lautens was hired by the Star to replace Pierre Berton. At the Star, Lautens became the most widely read columnist in Canada. In 1982, Lautens was named managing editor of the Star, and successfully increased the paper's circulation and profits even in the midst of an economic recession. He held the position for two years before returning to writing his humour column. On his time as managing editor, Lautens commented: \\"More important than the commercial success, however, has been the stand The Star has taken on issues I personally consider important - nuclear disarmament, drunk driving, acid rain, medicare, unemployment, the rape of our natural resources.\\" Lautens published four books during his lifetime. He was awarded a National Newspaper Award (1963)NNA awardee list for sports writing: http://www.nna-ccj.ca/award-archives/list-of- winners-since-1949/#9 and was a two-time winner of the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour (1981 and 1984). Two further books collecting some of his most popular columns ‚Äì Peace, Mrs. Packard and the Meaning of Life (1993) and The Best of Gary Lautens (1995) ‚Äì were published posthumously. In addition to his newspaper writing, Lautens hosted occasional television and radio programming on CBC Television. He was staff writer for many seasons of the iconic CBC series Front Page Challenge and appeared, for two seasons, as a panelist on It's Your Choice. His younger brother Trevor Lautens was a long-time columnist for the Vancouver Sun, his youngest son Richard Lautens is an acclaimed photojournalist for the Toronto Star and oldest son Stephen Lautens is also a noted Canadian newspaper columnist. =Death= Exterior view of Honest Ed's with Lautens' column visible (bottom left). Lautens died on February 1, 1992, after suffering a massive heart attack at his home in downtown Toronto. Upon news of Lautens' death, thousands of readers turned up at the Star offices, lining up for three days to sign books of condolence. Lincoln Alexander remarked: \\"He was a great guy ... So full of light, so full of humour. My close friend. His smile and humour will be sorely missed.\\" Following Lautens's death the Gary Lautens Memorial Scholarship was established at McMaster to assist students with high academic standing and demonstrating written journalistic skill. In 2002 Lautens family donated his papers, including correspondence, columns, scrapbooks and photographs, to McMaster University Library's William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections.

The Methodist Episcopal Church Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals was a major organization in the American temperance movement which led to the introduction of prohibition in 1920. It was headed for many years by Clarence True Wilson. The Methodist Episcopal Church South had a similar agency called the Board of Temperance and Social Service, with which Bishop James Cannon, Jr. was long associated. The success of Temperance movement would never have happened without the leadership of another Methodist, Frances Willard, leader of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), a mighty force, with chapters located throughout the United States and beyond. The Board of Temperance, Prohibition and Public Morals constructed the Methodist Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC in the 1920s to further increase its influence and lobbying power in public policy matters regarding alcoholic beverages. It was dedicated on January 16, 1924 Robert Dean McNeal, Valiant for Truth: Clarence True Wilson and Prohibition, 1992 ISBN 0-9632048-0-7 p. 47 with the famed orator and former presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan serving as a primary speaker. Located at 100 Maryland Ave NE, it faces the east side of the United States Capitol Building with the Supreme Court Building across the street to its south. After ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution established Prohibition, the Methodist Board promoted its aggressive enforcement. It also attempted to eliminate any criticism or opposition to what many called the Noble Experiment. In 1925, it charged that vaudeville acts and comic strips were being used to dispense wet (anti- prohibition) propaganda in New York City, which it called \\"a foreign city, run by foreigners for foreigners according to foreign ideas.\\" Clarence True Wilson led the way and traveled widely promoting temperance and prohibition. He and his wife often traveled with Clarence Darrow, the famed agonistic, and Darrow's wife. They found that hearing both of them debate the wisdom and merits of Prohibition drew much attention and lively crowds. After about a dozen years, and many unintended consequences, Prohibition was repealed. In 1964 The Methodist Board of Temperance was merged with the Methodist Board of Social and Economic Relations and the Methodist Board of World Peace to create the Board of Christian Social Concerns. After the 1968 merger of The Methodist Church with the Evangelical United Brethren Church the name became The General Board of Church and Society (GBCS). A debate ensued over who would have use of the funds from leasing space in the building. Some said the 1965 trust contract required all principal and income from the trust's assets to be used exclusively for \\"work in the areas of temperance and alcohol problems.\\" However, copies of the original pledge cards found at the United Methodist Archives, Drew University, indicated that the building was being built as Protestant presence on Capitol Hill. Some United Methodists have pointed out that the General Board of Church and Society supports programs on antiwar, care for creation, human rights, racism, healthcare, economic justice, and dozens of other activities unrelated to reducing the consumption of alcohol. GBCS officials responded that they interpret the trust's language to include a variety of social causes. The General Board of Church and Society petitioned the D.C. Superior Court to ratify its interpretation of the 1965 trust document. At trial the District of Columbia Superior Court ruled in favor of GBCS. The United Methodist Building now houses the Washington offices of a number of faith related organizations as they work in is issue based coalitions to address critical social concerns and present a common voice to congressional offices and the US administration.

It is one of four international general program boards of The United Methodist Church as set out the UMC Book of Discipline. The General Board has headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. and at the Interchurch Center in New York City. There are five divisions within the GBCS: Public Witness and Advocacy, Administration, Ministry of Resourcing Congregational Life, United Nations Ministry and Communications. Purpose According to the 2004 Book of Discipline, the GBCS's purpose is thus stated: 1002. Purpose - The purpose of the board shall be to relate the gospel of Jesus Christ to the members of the Church and to the persons and structures of the communities and world in which they live. It shall seek to bring the whole of human life, activities, possessions, use of resources, and community and world relationships into conformity with the will of God. It shall show the members of the Church and the society that the reconciliation that God effected through Christ involves personal, social, and civic righteousness. Spheres of Influence There are six stated spheres of influence for the GBCS # The Natural World # The Nurturing Community # The Social Community # The Economic Community # The Political Community # The World Community  Social Issues  The GBCS was traditionally pro-choice and supportive of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. In 2008, this was affirmed by the General Conference, but, in 2016, it voted in favor of withdrawing the United Methodist Church from the pro-choice organization. The GBCS remains supportive of legal abortion in certain circumstances stating \\"the General Board of Church and Society continues to be an advocate for a full range of safe and legal reproductive health care ‚Äì including, in certain cases, the option to safely and legally end a pregnancy.\\" On human sexuality, the GBCS opposes discrimination or prejudice against people based on sexual orientation. In 2013, the organization allowed its building, in Washington D.C, to be used by supporters of same-gender marriage. In 2019, the GBCS joined with 42 other religious and allied organizations in issuing a statement opposing Project Blitz, an effort by a coalition of Christian right organizations to influence state legislation.

Target audience  HKCTV originally targeted the middle-class subscribers who would be willing to pay for a diversified choice of local and international programmes. Afterwards, it adopted a price discrimination marketing scheme charging residents of public estates with lower prices when compared to the private housing residents. Along with lowered prices, subscribers from the working class can also enjoy benefited services that come along with the combo offered, such as cheaper phone line services from Wharf Holdings Limited and broadband internet access services from I-Cable. Occasionally, HKCTV would use \\"give-away\\" marketing strategies to attract more subscribers such as its 12th Anniversary combo; subscribers would be gifted with a DVD recorder upon subscription to their combos. These business strategies have successfully increased HKCTV's sales to over 540,000 current subscribers as well as free news (Newsline Express) on Hong Kong's KCRC Railway.  Operation  HKCTV is operated through two separate yet complementary networks, namely the wireless Multipoint Microwave Distribution System coaxial network (MMDS) and the wireline Hybrid Fibre coaxial network (HFC). The combined networks serve 1.70 million viewers, which take up 95% of the local households. MMDS is a programming broadcast through specific transmitters throughout Hong Kong. Broadcast signals are released from the transmitters to various \\"dishes\\" which are located on the rooftops of buildings, and are further transmitted to customers' televisions through the in-built coaxial cable. The hybrid fibre- coaxial network consists of a fibre optic backbone which forms the base of the whole broadcast centre. It develops into smaller \\"branches\\" and penetrates into different areas in Hong Kong along the MTR tunnels, ending in customers' homes through the coaxial cable that the MMDS uses. This network enables high capacity which allows HKCTV to house over 31 channels as well as other telecommunication services.  Multi-media service  Taking the advantage of i-CABLE's comprehensive optical fibre and cord network, the group dived into the swiftly expanding Internet market. Its multi-media service center was found in January 1999 to facilitate the development of the second core business that the group eagerly aims to expand. The group started the dial-up Internet service in March 1999, with subscriptions climbing to 185,000 in October 2000. This huge number took up 10% of the dial-up Internet service market. In March 2000, it further developed into a cable modem-based broadband service. This service proved to be successful when the service crept to the local households at an average rate of 80,000 homes per month, resulting in a total of 700,000 homes by October 2000. It is thus not surprising that the Group has the fastest development in expanding its cable modem service in the world. The high-speed broadband network service was presented after the acquisition of the certification of telecommunications service. Its provision of a 24-hour online broadband network service made the surfing speed faster and steadier than the traditional dial-up network. The outstanding basic service construction and sales tactics successfully made the group one of the two main broadband network service suppliers in Hong Kong. The visual content of HKCTV provides the platform for the multi-media service unit to develop fee-charging portals on news, movies, horse racing, stocks and adult entertainment.21126888.com as well as HKCTV e-Programme Listing were also designed to provide value added services to HKCTV's subscribers and advertisers. Besides, 21126888.com provides an online platform for its advertisers. Since 2005, the company have also launched its \\"Multi-Media on Board\\" (MMOB) service on public transit vehicles. HKCTV's Hong Kong Cable News Express is the sole airtime sales distributor and content provider to KCR Newsline Express. Instant and updated news are broadcast between the various railway notices of KCR journeys through the use of KCR's Passenger Information Display System, also known as PIDS. This further emphasises HKCTV's theme of providing updated news to its viewers, even when its viewers are not sitting in front of a television or computer. This is also a useful marketing tactic to attract more clients to its home subscriptions after experiencing its instantaneous service. Simultaneously, it gains income and reputation from advertisers for interactive advertising in KCR, one of the most essential transport systems in Hong Kong.  Other services  i-CABLE Communications Limited provide broadband internet as one of their services.  Competition and development  HKCTV is the second subscription-based TV station in Hong Kong apart from the 1957 Rediffusion Television (RTV). Before the liberalisation of the pay-TV market, the market was dominated by HKCTV and iTV, previously a subsidiary of Cable & Wireless HKT, currently owned by PCCW. In 1999, the HKSAR Government invited bids to open up the Pay TV market so as to give consumers more choices. The pay-TV market was officially opened for bid in early July 2000, leading to its expeditious development. Its opening also led to the increase in competitions for programming and market shares, as evidenced in the various extensive use of advertising and propaganda. According to the Hong Kong Annual Reports 2003‚Äì Telecommunications, there were four domestic pay television programme service licencees in Hong Kong: *Hong Kong Cable Television Limited (HKCTV) * now TV, operated by PCCW VOD Limited (PCCW VOD) * TVB Pay Vision, operated by Television Broadcast Company (TVB), and distributed through now TV and Hutchison Global Communications (HGC) * HKBN bbTV, operated by HKBN, an Internet Service Provider of Hong Kong. By the end of 2003, a total of 130 pay TV channels have become available in Hong Kong. The total number of subscribers has exceeded 860,000. With the entry of new competitors such as NOW Broadband TV and TVB Pay Vision, increasing competition is expected in the future Pay-TV market.

The estate was originally deeded by the Dutch West India Company in 1630 to Kiliaen van Rensselaer, a Dutch merchant and one of the company's original directors. Rensselaerswyck extended for miles on each side of the Hudson River near present-day Albany. It included most of what are now the present New York counties of Albany and Rensselaer, as well as parts of Columbia and Greene counties. Under the terms of the patroonship, the patroon had nearly total jurisdictional authority, establishing civil and criminal law, villages, a church (in part to record vital records, which were not done by the state until the late 19th century). Tenant farmers were allowed to work on the land, but had to pay rent to the owners, and had no rights to property. In addition, the Rensselaers harvested timber from the property. The patroonship was maintained intact by Rensselaer descendants for more than two centuries. It was split up after the death of Stephen van Rensselaer III in 1839. His son Stephen Van Rensselaer IV, the 10th and last patroon, received the bulk of his holdings; son William received some lands east of the Hudson. At his death, Steven van Rensselaer III's land holdings made him the tenth-richest American in history to date. Under his sons tenant farmers began protesting the manor system, part of a sweeping challenge in New York State. Under financial, judicial, and political pressure from this anti-rent movement Stephen IV and William sold off most of their land, ending the patroonship in the 1840s. For length of operations, it was the most successful patroonship established under the West India Company system. Establishing patroonships Upon discovery of the Albany area by Henry Hudson in 1609, the Dutch claimed the area and set up two forts to anchor it: Fort Nassau in 1614 and Fort Orange in 1624, both named for the Dutch noble House of Orange-Nassau. This established a Dutch presence in the area, formally called New Netherland. In June 1620, the Dutch West India Company was established by the States-General and given enormous powers in the New World. In the name of the States-General, it had the authority to make contracts and alliances with princes and natives, build forts, administer justice, appoint and discharge governors, soldiers, and public officers, and promote trade in New Netherland. In order to attract capitalists to the colony, the managers of the West India Company, offered certain exclusive privileges to the members of the company in 1630. The terms of the charter stated that any member who founded a colony of fifty adults in New Netherland within four years of the charter's writing would be acknowledged as a patroon of the territory to be colonized. The only restriction was that the colony had to be outside the island of Manhattan. To meet such cases, the West India Company adopted the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions for the agricultural colonization of its American province. The chief features of this charter stated that lands for each colony could extend in length if confined to one side of a navigable river or if both sides were occupied. Additionally, the lands could extend into the countryside and even be enlarged if more immigrants were to settle there. Each patroon would have the chief command within their respective patroonship, having the sole rights to fish and hunt. If a city were to be founded within its boundaries, the patroon would have the power and authority to establish officers and magistrates. Each patroonship was free of taxes and tariffs for ten years following its founding. A contract to settle under a patroonship was enforceable: no colonists could leave the colony during their term of service without the written consent of the patroon, and the West India Company pledged itself to do everything in its power to apprehend and deliver up all fugitives from the patroon's service. Colonists of a patroonship were limited by the West India Company in some instances. For example, fur trading was illegal for colonists; it was reserved as a Company monopoly. But, patroonships had the right to trade anywhere from Newfoundland to Florida, on the understanding that traders were to stop at Manhattan to possibly trade there first. Each patroon was required to \\"satisfy the Indians of that place for the land\\", proscribing that the land must be bought (or bartered) from the local Indians, and not just taken.15px Dutch West India Company: Article XXVI of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions on Wikisource. Additionally, the Company agreed to defend all colonists, whether free or in service, from all aggressors,15px Dutch West India Company: Article XXV of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions on Wikisource and supply the patroonship‚Äî for free ‚Äî\\"with as many blacks as it possibly can... for [no] longer [a] time than it shall see fit\\".15px Dutch West India Company: Article XXX of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions on Wikisource Founding the Manor Kiliaen van Rensselaer, a pearl and diamond merchant of Amsterdam, was one of the original directors of the West India Company and one of the first to take advantage of the new settlement charter. On January 13, 1629, van Rensselaer sent notification to the Directors of the Company that he, in conjunction with fellow Company members Samuel Godyn and Samuel Blommaert, sent Gillis Houset and Jacob Jansz Cuyper to determine satisfactory locations for settlement. This took place even before the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions was ratified, but was done in agreement with a draft of the Charter from March 28, 1628. On April 8, 1630, a representative for van Rensselaer purchased a large tract of land from its American Indian owners adjacent to Fort Orange, on the west side of the Hudson River. It extended from Beeren Island north to Smack's Island and extended \\"two day's journey into the interior.\\" In the meantime, van Rensselaer made vigorous preparations to send out tenants. Early in the spring, several emigrants, with their farm implements and cattle, were sent out from the Netherlands under Wolfert Gerritson, who was designated the overseer of farms. These pioneers of the manor embarked at the island of Texel in the ship Eendragt, or Unity, under Captain John Brouwer. In a few weeks, they arrived at Fort Orange and began the development and settlement of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. A few weeks after the arrival of the first colonists, the patroon's special agent, Gillis Hassett, secured a grant of land from the Indians, lying mostly to the north of Fort Orange and extending up the river to an Indian structure called Monemins Castle. This was situated on Haver Island at the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. This and the earlier purchase completed the bounds of the manor on the west side of the Hudson. Each tenant was required to swear an oath of loyalty to the patroon, without question. The following is the oath stated by each tenant: Historical marker at the dividing line between the Manor of Rensselaerswyck and the City of Albany. At that time, the land on the east side of the river, extending north from Castle Island to the Mohawk River was then the private property of an Indian chief named Nawanemitt. This territory was called \\"Semesseck\\" by the Indians, and described in the grant as \\"lying on the east side of the aforesaid river, opposite the Fort Orange, as well above as below, and from Poetanock, the millcreek, northward to Negagonee, being about twelve miles, large measure.\\" These purchases took place on August 8, and August 13, 1630, respectively, confirmed by the council at Manhattan, and patents formally issued therefor. Fort Orange and the land immediately around its walls, still remained under the exclusive jurisdiction of the West India Company. It eventually developed as the city of Albany, which was never under the direct dominion of the patroon. But this large purchase by van Rensselaer excited the jealousy of other capitalists. He soon divided his estate around and near Fort Orange into five shares, in an effort to advance more rapidly the growth of the colony. Two of these shares he retained, together with the title and honors of the original patroon. One share was given to Johannes de Laet, another was given to Samuel Godyn, and the last to Samuel Bloommaert; these three men were influential members of the Amsterdam chamber of the West India Company. On the ancient map of the colony, \\"Bloommaert's Burt\\" is located at the mouth of what is now called Patroon Creek. \\"De Laet's Island\\" was the original name of van Rensselaer Island, opposite Albany. \\"De Laet's Burg\\" equates to Greenbush. \\"Godyn's Islands\\" are a short distance below, on the east shore. These three separate patroonships were subsequently purchased and dissolved into Rensselaerswyck proper by 1685. =Government= The government of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck was vested in a general court, which exercised executive, legislative or municipal, and judicial functions. This court was composed of two commissioners, styled \\"Gecommitteerden\\", and two councilors, called \\"Gerechts-persoonen\\", or \\"Schepenen\\". These last equated to our modern justices of the peace. There was also a colonial secretary, a \\"Schout-fiscaal\\", or sheriff, and a \\"Gerechts- bode\\", court messenger or constable. The magistrates held their offices for a year, the court appointing their successors. The most important office in the colony was the schout-fiscaal, or sheriff. Jacob Albertsen Planck was the first sheriff of Rensselaerswyck. Arent van Curler, who immigrated as assistant commissary, was soon after his arrival promoted to commissary- general, or superintendent of the colony. He also served as colonial secretary until 1642, when he was succeeded by Anthony de Hooges. =Culture= The population of the colony of Rensselaerswyck in its early days consisted of three classes: freemen on top, who emigrated from Holland at their own expense; farmers next; and farm servants sent by the patroon at the bottom of the caste system. The first patroon judiciously applied his large resources to the advancement of his interests, and was quick to assist people on the estate. He initially defined several farms on both sides of the river, on which he ordered houses, barns, and stables to be erected. The patroon paid to stock these farms with cattle, horses, and sometimes with sheep, and furnished the necessary wagons, plows, and other implements. So the early farmer entered upon his land without being embarrassed by want of capital. Sustaining the Manor {class=\\"userboxes\\" align=\\"left\\"  } History is almost certain that Kiliaen van Rensselaer never visited his land in New Netherland. The Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts, a collection of translated primary documents from that time, state, > The present letters show beyond the possibility of doubt that Kiliaen van > Rensselaer did not visit his colony in person between 1630 and 1643, and the > records preserved among the Rensselaerswyck manuscripts make it equally > certain that he did not do so between the last named date and his death‚Ä¶ > Upon van Rensselaer's death in the 1640s, Manor House, or Fort Crailo, c.1663 The estate was inherited by his eldest son Jan Baptist, who acquired the title of patroon. He died in 1658 and his younger brother Jeremias van Rensselaer became patroon. Acknowledging the surrender of New Amsterdam and Fort Orange to England in 1664 following a surprise incursion by the English during a time of peace (which led to the Second Anglo‚ÄìDutch War), Jeremias took the oath of allegiance to the King of England that October. In 1666, he also built the original Manor House, also known as Fort Crailo for its defensive reinforcement, located north of Fort Orange. The Manor House was the seat of the patroonship and the home of the patroon until 1765. House at the Watervliet farm, built by Jeremias van Rensselaer following the April 7, 1666 flood. Jeremias died in 1674 and the estate was passed on to his oldest son, Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, grandson to the first patroon, his namesake. Kiliaen was eleven when his father died. The estate was managed on his behalf, and he did not acquire the title of Lord of the Manor until he was twenty-one. Maria van Cortlandt van Rensselaer, Jeremias's wife and Kiliaen's mother was the administrator and treasurer of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck until 1687. In 1683, one year before Kiliaen became Lord of the Manor, New York Governor Thomas Dongan established Albany County, one of the original twelve counties in New York. The county was to \\"containe the Towns of Albany, the Collony Renslaerwyck, Schonecteda, and all the villages, neighborhoods, and Christian Plantacons on the east side of Hudson River from Roelof Jansen's Creeke, and on the west side from Sawyer's Creeke to the Sarraghtoga.\\" In 1685, Governor Dongan granted a patent for Rensselaerswyck, making it a legal entity. The patent included a detailed description of its boundaries, stating: One year later in 1686, Albany was chartered as a city under the Dongan Charter, authored by Governor Dongan. During Kiliaen's tenure as patroon, he served in many political appointed positions in Albany, including assessor, justice, and supervisor, and represented Rensselaerswyck in the New York General Assembly. In 1704, Kiliaen split Rensselaerswyck into two portions, the southern portion, or \\"Lower Manor\\" (comprising Greenbush and Claverack), placed under the eye of his brother Hendrick. The northern portion retained the title Rensselaerswyck. Hendrick von Rensselaer lived in Albany until a year after receiving the Lower Manor, representing Rensselaerswyck in the General Assembly from 1705 until 1715, just as his brother had from 1693 to 1704. 1767 map of Rensselaerswyck Kiliaen died in 1719 and the patroonship passed on to his oldest son Jeremias. Jeremias died in 1745 and the estate passed to his brother Stephen. Stephen, sickly at the time, died two years later in 1747 at the age of forty. The estate was passed on to his son, Stephen van Rensselaer II, who was five when his father died. Stephen II was active in the Albany County Militia and active in restructuring loose land leases created by his predecessors. One of his land deals was made in the eastern region of Rensselaerswyck; the Town of Stephentown in southeastern Rensselaer County was named for him. He also rebuilt the Manor House in 1765. Stephen van Rensselaer III Stephen II died in 1769 at the age of 27 as one of the richest men in the region. The Manor passed on to his eldest son Stephen van Rensselaer III, who was five at the time of his father's death. The estate was controlled by Abraham Ten Broeck until Stephen III's twenty-fifth birthday. Stephen III attended school in Albany and then New Jersey and Kingston during the Revolution. He graduated from Harvard College in 1782. Stephen van Rensselaer III became well known for his many achievements. In 1825, he was elected Grand Master of the New York State Grand Masonic Lodge. He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1789 and was re-elected until chosen by the legislature for the New York State Senate in 1791. In 1795 he was elected Lieutenant Governor of New York. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1822, serving until 1829. He was also commissioned a Lieutenant General in the New York State Militia, and led an unsuccessful invasion of Canada at Niagara in the War of 1812. His most lasting achievement was to found, with Amos Eaton, the Rensselaer School, which developed into the present-day Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Anti-rent movement and downfall Stephen III lived to be 75, dying in 1839. He is remembered as \\"The Good Patroon\\" and also \\"The Last Patroon\\" because he was legally the last patroon of Rensselaerswyck. At the time of his death, Stephen III was worth about $10 million (about $88 billion in 2007 dollars) and is noted as being the tenth-richest American in history. The spectacle of a landed gentleman living in semi-feudal splendor among his 3,000 tenants was an anachronism to a postwar generation that had become acclimated to Jacksonian democracy. Stephen III's leniency toward his tenants had created a serious problem for his heirs. His will directed them to collect and apply the back rents (approximately $400,000) toward the payment of the patroon's debts. As soon as the rent notices went out, the farmers organized committees and held public meetings in protest. Stephen IV, who had inherited the \\"West Manor\\" (Albany County), refused to meet with a committee of anti- renters and turned down their written request for a reduction of rents. His brusque refusal infuriated the farmers. On July 4, 1839, a mass meeting at Berne called for a declaration of independence from landlord rule but raised the amount the tenants were willing to pay. The answer to this proposal was soon forthcoming. The executors of the estate secured writs of ejectment in suits against tenants in arrears. Crowds of angry tenants manhandled Sheriff Michael Archer and his assistants and turned back a posse of 500 men. Sheriff Archer called upon Governor William H. Seward for military assistance. Seward's proclamation calling on the people not to resist the enforcement of the law and the presence of several hundred militiamen overawed the tenants. The tenants persisted in their refusal to pay rent. Of course the sheriff could and did evict a few, but he could not dispossess an entire township. Nassau By 1844 the anti-rent movement had grown from a localized struggle against the van Rensselaer family to a full-fledged revolt against leasehold tenure throughout eastern New York, where other major manors existed. Virtual guerrilla warfare broke out. Riders disguised as Indians and wearing calico gowns ranged through the countryside, terrorizing the agents of the landlords. In late 1844, Governor William Bouck sent three companies of militia to Hudson, where anti-renters threatened to storm the jail and release their leader, Big Thunder (Dr. Smith A. Boughton, in private life). The following year Governor Silas Wright was forced to declare Delaware County in a state of insurrection after an armed rider had killed undersheriff Osman N. Steele August 7, 1845 at an eviction sale. The anti-renters organized town, county, and state committees, published their own newspapers, held conventions, and elected their own spokesmen to the legislature. The success of candidates endorsed by anti-renters in 1845 caused politicians in both parties to show a \\"wonderful anxiety\\" to \\"give the Anti-renters all they ask.\\" The legislature abolished the right of the landlord to seize the goods of a defaulting tenant and taxed the income which landlords derived from their rent. Shortly thereafter, the Constitutional Convention of 1846 prohibited any future lease of agricultural land which claimed rent or service for a period longer than twelve years. Yet neither the convention nor the legislature was willing to disturb existing leases. The anti-renters played politics with remarkable success in the years between 1846 and 1851. They elected friendly sheriffs and local officials who virtually paralyzed the efforts of the landlords to collect rents. They threw their weight to the candidates of either major party who would support their cause. The bitter rivalries between and within the Whig and Democratic parties enabled the anti-renters to exert more influence than their numbers warranted. As a result, they had a small but determined bloc of anti-rent champions in the Assembly and the Senate who kept landlords uneasy by threatening to pass laws challenging land titles. The anti-rent endorsement of John Young, the Whig candidate for governor in 1846, proved decisive. Governor Young promptly pardoned several anti-rent prisoners and called for an investigation of title by the Attorney General. The courts eventually ruled the statute of limitations prevented any questioning of the original titles. Declaring that the holders of perpetual leases were in reality freeholders, the Court of Appeals outlawed the \\"quarter sales,\\" i.e., the requirement in many leases that a tenant who disposed of his farm should pay one-fourth of the money to the landlord. Assailed by a concerted conspiracy not to pay rent and harassed by taxes and investigations of the Attorney General, the landed proprietors gradually sold out their interests. In August 1845, seventeen large landholders announced that they were willing to sell. Later that year, Stephen IV agreed to sell his rights in the Helderberg townships. His brother, William, who had inherited the \\"East Manor\\" in Rensselaer County, also sold out his rights in over 500 farms in 1848. Finally, in the 1850s, two speculators purchased the remaining leases from the van Rensselaers. Notes  References  Bibliography  .

In 1470 he was commissioned by Bartolomeo Colleoni to complete his funerary chapel, the Cappella Colleoni in Bergamo, which had been begun by Guiniforte and Francesco Solari.

Amadeo also designed the funerary monument to Medea Colleoni, which was intended for the church of Santa Maria della Basella in Urgnano. The condottiero's tomb was realized in collaboration with other artists, with Amadeo providing the reliefs of the lower sarcophagus and of the smaller upper sarcophagus, as well seven statues of the Virtues. Amadeo was also commissioned by Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza to work for some years in the Certosa di Pavia. During 1473-1476, Amadeo realized half of the bas-reliefs in the right side of the fa√ßade. In 1480 he finished the arch of the Persian Martyrs in the Olivetani Monastery of Cremona (four marble reliefs remain today, dated 1484).

In 1485 he collaborated with his brother-in-law Pietro Antonio Solari in the Ospedale Maggiore of Milan, a project of which he was made director ten years later. Kneeling Angel, c. 1447-1552, National Gallery of Art Amadeo was then active in the decoration of the Milan Cathedral. He collaborated with Donato Bramante on the facade of Santa Maria presso San Satiro in Milan. In 1488 Amadeo was commissioned by Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, to become director of works of the new Pavia Cathedral, again with Bramante having a minor role. In 1489, he helped design and build the Arca di San Lanfranco for the church of that name in Pavia.Parrocchia di San Lanfranco. In this period he worked also as Ducal engineer for Ludovico il Moro, designing fortifications at Chiavenna and Piattamale, as well as repairing of roads and bridges in Valtellina and (in the 16th century) hydraulic works; for Ludovico he also realized a Loggia in the Ducal Palace of Vigevano, as well as some statues for the Milanese Cathedral. From 1495 Amadeo directed the works of the church of Santa Maria presso San Celso at Milan. From 1497 he directed works at the Milan Cathedral, finishing the tambour in 1500. In the 16th century, Amadeo designed the church of Santa Maria di Canepanova, also in Pavia. In 1501 he sculpted reliefs with \\"Stories of the Carthusians\\" and \\"life of St. Bruno\\" for the Certosa of Pavia. In 1982 it has been proven that the Sanctuary of Santa Maria alla Fontana in Milan, attributed for many years to Leonardo da Vinci was in fact designed by Amadeo. In 1508 he also presented a model for the spire of the Milan Cathedral, which was not executed. To Amadeo has been also attributed the notable fa√ßade of the Cathedral of Lugano, considered a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. He died in Milan in 1522.

It may also be used in certain types of cardiac stress tests. It is given by injection into a vein or intraosseous as a continuous infusion. The amount of medication needs to be adjusted to the desired effect. Onset of effects is generally seen within 2 minutes. Common side effects include a fast heart rate, an irregular heart beat, and inflammation at the site of injection. Use is not recommended in those with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. It primarily works by direct stimulation of Œ≤1 receptors, which increases the strength of the heart's contractions. Generally it has little effect on a person's heart rate. Dobutamine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1978. It is available as a generic medication. It was initially made from isoproterenol. Medical uses Dobutamine is used to treat acute but potentially reversible heart failure, such as which occurs during cardiac surgery or in cases of septic or cardiogenic shock, on the basis of its positive inotropic action. Dobutamine can be used in cases of congestive heart failure to increase cardiac output. It is indicated when parenteral therapy is necessary for inotropic support in the short-term treatment of patients with cardiac decompensation due to depressed contractility, which could be the result of either organic heart disease or cardiac surgical procedures. It is not useful in ischemic heart disease because it increases heart rate and thus increases myocardial oxygen demand. The drug is also commonly used in the hospital setting as a pharmacologic stress testing agent to identify coronary artery disease. Adverse effects Primary side effects include those commonly seen for Œ≤1 active sympathomimetics, such as hypertension, angina, arrhythmia, and tachycardia. Used with caution in atrial fibrillation as it has the effect of increasing the atrioventricular (AV) conduction. The most dangerous side effect of dobutamine is increased risk of arrhythmia, including fatal arrhythmias. Pharmacology Dobutamine is a direct-acting agent whose primary activity results from stimulation of the Œ≤1-adrenoceptors of the heart, increasing contractility and cardiac output. Since it does not act on dopamine receptors to inhibit the release of norepinephrine (another Œ±1 agonist), dobutamine is less prone to induce hypertension than is dopamine. Dobutamine is predominantly a Œ≤1-adrenergic agonist, with weak Œ≤2 activity, and Œ±1 selective activity, although it is used clinically in cases of cardiogenic shock for its Œ≤1 inotropic effect in increasing heart contractility and cardiac output. Dobutamine is administered as a racemic mixture consisting of both (+) and (‚àí) isomers; the (+) isomer is a potent Œ≤1 agonist and Œ±1 antagonist, while the (‚àí) isomer is an Œ±1 agonist. The administration of the racemate results in the overall Œ≤1 agonism responsible for its activity. (+)-Dobutamine also has mild Œ≤2 agonist activity, which makes it useful as a vasodilator. History It was developed in the 1970s by Drs. Ronald Tuttle and Jack Mills at Eli Lilly and Company, as a structural analogue of isoprenaline.

The college section became St. Francis College, a private predominantly undergraduate college in Brooklyn Heights. It took its current name in 1935, then moved to a larger facility in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in 1952. The school moved to its current location in Fresh Meadows, Queens in 1974 when it acquired the facility that formerly housed Bishop Reilly High School, a co-educational Catholic high school. The school began admitting female students that same year. A fitness center was added recently and the science labs are being updated. There are currently plans to add a three-story addition to the rear of the existing building. The upgrades to the art rooms will support students in the studio, digital and the performing arts.

Its western terminus is along Ocean Avenue at the western city limits of Lompoc, and its eastern terminus is at State Route 154 in Santa Ynez. Route description Most of the road is two lanes wide, with the exception of the route through the cities of Lompoc and Buellton. This is the primary route from U.S. Route 101 to Solvang, one of the Santa Ynez Valley's biggest tourist attractions. It follows the Santa Ynez River for most of its length. The portion of the route through Solvang is called Mission Drive, while through Lompoc‚Äîincluding the portion where it is co-signed with State Route 1‚Äîit is called Ocean Avenue. SR 246 begins at the western city limits of Lompoc, where it runs along Ocean Avenue to H Street, joining SR 1. The SR 246/SR 1 concurrency continues east along Ocean Avenue to the eastern edge of the city. SR 246 then splits from SR 1 and heads northeast out of Lompoc along a relatively flat two-lane road until reaching Buellton, where it widens upon its intersection with US 101. It narrows once again to two lanes through Solvang and Santa Ynez before reaching its eastern terminus at the junction with State Route 154. This is the main alternate route from Northern Santa Barbara County to the South Coast. It is also notable for passing two of Santa Barbara County's three Spanish-era missions, Santa In√©s (in Solvang) and La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n (near Lompoc). Part of SR 246 in Lompoc is in the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

He was a member of the Communist Party of Germany and along with numerous other resistance fighters was executed by the Nazis. Hensel was born in Dresden where he and fellow communist members began their work against the Nazi regime. Communism and the Reichstag Fire Hitler became agitated by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) after the Reichstag fire on February 23, 1933. The fire was started by Marinus van der Lubbe who was accused of being one of many communist agitators; however, a trial in March 1933 determined van der Lubbe acted alone. The Reichstag fire caused Hitler to create the Enabling Act which removed habeas corpus and many other civil liberties, providing Hitler with dictatorial control over Germany. Hitler quickly established a plan to execute any person who was working against the Nazi party and twice extended the act beyond its initial 1937 expiration. The Enabling Act also allowed Hitler to rule that all competing political parties of the Nazi regime were illegal. Albert Hensel and his co-conspirators did not have the strength to outwardly fight against Hitler, so they took a secretive approach to resisting. The German police were secretive in their counter efforts as well. The resisters were often not well received by the German populace and had to also hide their actions from them in fear of the citizens informing the police of their actions. The Resistance Most of the resistance‚Äôs actions involved industrial sabotage or publications that spoke of overthrowing Hitler and his government while promoting an anti-capitalist state. The KPD published a booklet in 1934 titled, ‚ÄúWe are Fighting for a Soviet Germany‚Äù. That publication and the regular printing of a KPD newspaper, reasoned that the elimination of capitalism would erase religions and the hatred of religions including anti-Semitism. Hensel would also join the Red Front or Rotfrontk√§mpferbund (RFB, other variants: Der Rote Frontk√§mpferbund, Roter Frontk√§mpferbund) (English: Red Front Fighters' League, Red Front Fighters Association) a paramilitary organization of the Communist Party of Germany, created on July 18, 1924, in Germany of the Weimar Republic period. Its first leader was Ernst Th√§lmann. The Red Front was banned in 1932. The Dresden activists represented a small minority of the KPD included, Wilhelm Firl (journalist), Otto Gale (cobbler), Franz Hoffman, Kurt Schlosser, and Herbert Blcohwitz (carpenters), Arno Lade (team conductor), Franz Latzel (metal worker), Hans Rothbarth (textile worker), and Hans Daukner (Jewish Gardner). Members of the Resistance The KPD members were predominantly made up of the unemployed. Many of its members relied on the group for food, clothing, and housing which may have caused some to become members. The organization promised to pay its members for battling the German Nazis but likely were unable to provide any financial support. The KPD gained significant political power in Germany through the support of Hensel and its other members. At its height in 1933, the KPD held 1/6 of the seats in the German congress. Hensel helped establish the Communist Party of Germany along with Karl Stein, Fritz Shulze and his wife Eva Schulze Knabe, Arno Lade, and Hans Rothbarth were residents of Dresden and all were opponents of the Nazis. Many of them were convicted of treason by the Volksgerichtshof and eventually executed. Plotzensee Prison Hensel was one of over 2500 executions that took place at Plotzensee Prison. Hensel was arrested on February 6, 1941, and remained in custody at Plotzensee for over fourteen months. He was executed on June 5, 1942, at Plotzensee Prison in Berlin after being tried and convicted by the Volksgerichtshof. Hensel was executed by either hanging or beheading on June 5, 1942. The cottage where the executions took place is still standing. Plotzensee is still operating in Germany. After World War II, the prison was used to house juvenile delinquents until 1987 when the juveniles were housed in a newly built facility nearby. After the juveniles were moved, the prison has been used as a men‚Äôs prison which still remains in operation. References * Divided memory : the Nazi past in the two Germanys; Herf, Jeffrey.

It was published for the Amiga and Atari ST by Electronic Arts. The objective is to collect all the litter and find the exit to the level. Plot The player controls a character named Quiffy who is the last of his race of small green creatures. He lives underground in a series of sewers and tunnels. His mission is to reach the surface by navigating all the sewers, whilst they are slowly flooding. Quiffy can walk on walls and ceilings. Gameplay Quiffy must collect all of the various pieces of litter on the level and then find the exit to complete each level. In general the litter is not particularly hidden, it is just distributed around the level. Quiffy can climb on most walls and ceilings, and swim through water. He has energy which depletes upon touching dangerous objects, but can also die instantly when touching any of the few lethal objects. Although he can swim and has the appearance of an amphibious life-form, he can only breathe above water and will start to drown if he runs out of air. In each level, the player is followed by the ghost of Aunt Matilda, copying the player's movements and starts off about 15 seconds behind. However, she is very slightly faster and will eventually catch up. Touching the ghost will hurt Quiffy. Quiffy starts each level with no weapon, and can pick up any of five available weapons. He can only hold one of these at any time and if he picks up another one, it will swap for the current one. Most of the levels have taps in them, which pour water in to the level. The modelling of the water was quite advanced for a home computer game of its time; the water will flow to the lowest point that it can and when multiple taps are pouring water in one place, it will fill up proportionally fast. A lot of levels feature taps in all areas so the entire level will eventually flood, leaving Quiffy with no available source of air. This aspect is how the game derives its title. There are various enemies on each level, some of which have special properties. In general the enemies move around in a specific pattern, and when killed will throw a heart up which will return health to Quiffy. Reception The game was reviewed in 1990 in Dragon #164 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars.

David, eds. (2005). The Rise of Placental Mammals: Origins and Relationships of the Major Extant Clades. Johns Hopkins University Press. . (and rarely in the males as in the water opossumNogueira, Jos√© Carlos, et al. \\"Morphology of the male genital system of Chironectes minimus and comparison to other didelphid marsupials.\\" Journal of mammalogy 85.5 (2004): 834-841. and the extinct thylacine); the name marsupial is derived from the Latin marsupium, meaning \\"pouch\\". Marsupials give birth to a live but relatively undeveloped fetus called a joey. When the joey is born it crawls from inside the mother to the pouch. The pouch is a fold of skin with a single opening that covers the teats. Inside the pouch, the blind offspring attaches itself to one of the mother‚Äôs teats and remains attached for as long as it takes to grow and develop to a juvenile stage. Variations Pouches are different amongst different marsupials, two kinds distinguishable (on the front or belly): opening towards the head and extending the cavity under the skin towards the tail (forward, or up) or opening towards the tail and extending towards the front legs (to the rear, backward or down). For example for quolls and Tasmanian devils, the pouch opens to the rear and the joey only has to travel a short distance to get to the opening (resting place) of the pouch. While in the pouch they are permanently attached to the teat and once the young have developed they leave the pouch. The kangaroo's pouch opens horizontally on the front of the body, and the joey must climb a relatively long way to reach it. Kangaroos and wallabies allow their young to live in the pouch well after they are physically capable of leaving, often keeping two different joeys in the pouch, one tiny and one fully developed. In kangaroos, wallabies and opossums, the pouch opens forward or up. Female koalas have been described as having a ‚Äòbackward-opening‚Äô pouch like wombats, as opposed to an upward-opening pouch like kangaroos. However, that's not true. When a female Koala first gives birth to young her pouch opening faces neither up nor down, although it is located towards the bottom of the pouch rather than at the top. It faces straight outwards rather than ‚Äòbackwards‚Äô. It sometimes appears to be ‚Äòbackward-facing‚Äô because when the joey is older and leans out of the pouch, this pulls the pouch downwards or ‚Äòbackwards‚Äô. The pouch has a strong sphincter muscle at the opening to prevent the joey from falling out. In wombats and marsupial moles, the pouch opens backward or down. Backwards facing pouches would not work well in kangaroos or opossums as their young would readily fall out. Similarly, forward-facing pouches would not work well for wombats and marsupial moles as they both dig extensively underground. Their pouches would fill up with dirt and suffocate the developing young. Kangaroo mothers will lick their pouches clean before the joey crawls inside. Kangaroo pouches are sticky to support their young joey. Koalas are unable to clean out their pouches since they face backwards, so just prior to giving birth to the young koala joey, a self-cleaning system is activated, secreting droplets of an anti-microbial liquid that cleans it out. In a relatively short time, the cleansing droplets clean out all of the crusty material left inside, leaving an almost sterile nursery ready to receive the tiny joey. Some marsupials (e.g. phascogales) lack the true, permanent pouches seen in other species. Instead, they form temporary skin folds (sometimes called \\"pseudo- pouches\\") in the mammary region when reproducing. This type of pouch also occurs in monotremes (platypus and echidnas).

It is located at the junction of the Goulburn River and Jamieson River, north-east of Melbourne. The name is believed to have been derived from George Jamieson, a shepherd who grazed sheep in the area in the 1850s. At the time of the , Jamieson had a population of 301. The area was first settled in 1860 and by 1861 there were approximately 300 people working the goldfields. According to the book Jamieson Founders and Families by Dr Brian Lloyd, the first Post Office in the upper Goulburn district was at Mansfield in 1858. The first Post and Telegraph Office at Jamieson was on the west side of Bank Street. When the Oriental Bank closed down in 1865, the Post Office was moved across the street to occupy the bank building. The Post Office at its current location in Perkins St was from about 1872. The town site was surveyed in 1862, and a borough council was established in 1864. By 1865 the town had a Catholic chapel, an Anglican church, a school, a court house and police station, two banks, two insurance offices, five hotels and several stores. Jamieson reached its peak in the 1870s, but a sharp decline soon followed. Most mining operations had ceased by the beginning of the First World War, and Black Friday bushfires destroyed many mine workings in 1939. By the 1990s, the town had become a popular tourist destination, boosted by Lake Eildon (situated adjacent to the Jamieson township and formed by the damming of the Goulburn River) reaching 100% capacity in 1996. However the tourism industry suffered in the early 2000s following a drought which affected Lake Eildon. The drought has proven to be long term and in March 2007, the capacity of the lake reached a historic low of 7.9%. The Jamieson Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1983. Today, Jamieson has a permanent population of around 250. It is a popular destination for four wheel drive enthusiasts, fishers, and amateur gold diggers. It is close to Lake Eildon and the Mount Buller snowfields. The town has two hotels, a caravan park, and several bed and breakfast establishments. 2006-07 Victorian Bushfires In December 2006, Victoria's North-East was affected by many bushfires that would threaten to all merge into fewer, but bigger firefronts. Jamieson was one town at the centre of attention during these times, used as a major post for firefighters and media (Free-to-Air, Pay TV and newspaper journalists were based in the town). Luckily for Jamieson, fire breaks helped the Mount Terrible fire stay away from the town centre. It was also helped by a late Southerly Change that brought rain. However a short distance, both East and South East (Jamieson-Licola and Mansfield-Woods Point Roads) of the town were burnt in the blaze.

In addition to owning and managing many of the largest circuses in the United States, he was also a rancher, a real estate developer and art collector. He was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 1987.John Ringling Florida Artists Hall of Fame Early circus life The seven Ringling Brothers. John is pictured second from bottom. John was born in McGregor, Iowa, the fifth son in a family of seven sons and a daughter born to German immigrants, Marie Salom√© Juliar and August Ringling (a farmer and harness maker). The original family name was \\"Ruengeling\\". Five of those sons worked together to build a circus empire. The Ringlings started their first show in 1870 as \\"The Ringling Bros. United Monster Shows, Great Double Circus, Royal European Menagerie, Museum, Caravan, and Congress of Trained Animals\\", charging a penny for admission. In 1882, it was known as \\"The Ringling Bros. Classic and Comic Concert Company\\". By 1889, the circus was large enough to travel on railroad cars, rather than animal-drawn wagons. In 1905, John married Mable Burton. In 1907, the brothers bought the Barnum & Bailey circus for $400,000 from the estate of James Anthony Bailey and ran the two circuses as separate entities until the end of the 1918 season. John worked the circus with his brothers, declaring \\"We divided the work; but stood together.\\" John took the advance position, traveling ahead and booking the appearances and Charles was the operating manager. Building the circus empire The C√† d'Zan mansion in Sarasota was designed for Mable and John Ringling by Dwight James Baum and built by Owen Burns. After purchasing Barnum & Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth from the estate of James Bailey in 1907 the Ringling brothers were recognized as the \\"Circus Kings\\" in the United States as they controlled not only the show that carried their own name, but also the Barnum & Bailey circus and the Adam Forepaugh and Sells Brothers Circus. In the early 1900s the ranks of the brothers began thinning as Otto died unexpectedly in 1911. Four years later, the oldest sibling, Al Ringling also died, followed by brother Henry in 1918. At the same time that family management was evolving, the Ringlings were challenged by keeping two mammoth circuses touring during World War I. Manpower shortages, combined with railroad restrictions and the 1918 flu pandemic all contributed in the decision to merge the Ringling Bros World's Greatest Shows and the Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show on Earth at the end of the 1918 season. On October 8, 1918 the Ringling Bros. season concluded after performances in Waycross, Georgia and the circus trains were routed to the Barnum & Bailey Winter Quarters in Bridgeport, Connecticut. During the winter of 1918-19 the two circuses were combined into one enormous show, and on March 29, 1919, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus debuted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. After the death of Alf T. Ringling in 1919, brothers John and Charles made the decision to move the Winter Quarters to Sarasota, Florida in 1927 where the brothers were having success in real estate speculation. Although a resident of Sarasota, Charles died in 1926 before the move was complete. With the death of brother Charles, John was now the last of the Ringling brothers. Although other family members had inherited stock in the company, as President he continued to manage the circus in the years prior to The Great Depression. During the 1920s, Ringling built Gray Crag, a 20-room manor house on an estate that was their summer residence in Alpine, New Jersey, atop the New Jersey Palisades and overlooking the Hudson River. Ringling would bring the circus troupe across the river from Yonkers, New York, with acrobats and animals to entertain their guests at parties. With the financial and personal difficulties that Ringling faced during the Great Depression, control of the property was lost and the house was ultimately demolished in November 1935.Ritacco, Joseph. Circus Atmosphere; John Ringling's castle on the cliffs, (201) magazine, January 2015.

Accessed January 11, 2015. \\"It was in 1918 that John Ringling (that Ringing) and his wife Mable (n√©e Burton) bought two big properties here and merged them into the hundred-acre estate they named Gray Crag.\\" In 1909 John and his wife, Mable began spending their winters in Sarasota. The couple bought bay front property from Mary Louise and Charles N. Thompson, another circus manager who engaged several members of the Ringling family in land investments on the Florida Gulf Coast. Ringling commissioned a 30-room mansion which was inspired by the Venetian Gothic palaces, designed by New York architect Dwight James Baum, and built by Owen Burns, It was completed in 1926 and named C√† d'Zan, \\"The House of John\\" in the Venetian dialect of Italian. Later a museum was built on the grounds of the estate for their art collection. Because of their investments in real estate and the later development of the circus winter quarters as a tourist attraction, John and his brother, Charles are seen as pioneers in the development of Sarasota. After some 40 years in the entertainment business, along with his ownership of railroads, oil field and ranches John had become one of the richest men in the world. In addition he was a world traveler as he was always looking for new acts for his circus. It was during these travels to Europe that he began establishing a collection of old world masterpieces and a collection of Baroque art including four pieces by Peter Paul Rubens, known as cartoons. In 1929, John Ringling bought the American Circus Corporation, which consisted of the Sells-Floto Circus, the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, the John Robinson Circus, the Sparks Circus, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, and the Al G.

Decline in later life Ringling's health soon began to fail and the Great Depression (which gripped the nation almost as soon as he acquired the American Circus Corporation) dealt a severe financial blow to the John Ringling empire. He lost virtually his entire fortune, but was able to retain his home, the museum and his extensive art collection. His wife, Mable, died in June 1929 and he remarried on June 19, 1930 to Emily Haag Buck in Jersey City, New Jersey. Ringling was voted out of control of the business in 1932 by its board of directors and Sam Gumpertz was named vice president and general manager of the circus. John and Emily Haag Buck divorced on July 6, 1936. Death John Ringling died on December 2, 1936 in New York City. He was the last Ringling brother to die, as well as the longest-lived of the Ringling brothers. He was the only brother to reach his 70s. Once one of the world's wealthiest men, he died with only $311 in the bank.Burnett, Gene M., (1986). - Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State, Vol. 2. - Pineapple Press - p.190. - . At his death, he willed his Sarasota mansion, the museum, and his entire art collection to the state of Florida. The house, C√† d'Zan, and the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art offer visitors a glimpse into the lifestyle of the Roaring 20s and a renowned art collection. Another of John's legacies is the Ringling College of Art and Design, which asked to adopt his name because of the cultural influence of the museum and its collection. A museum devoted to the Ringling Brothers Circus has been established on the estate also. After his death, the circus was operated by his nephew, John Ringling North, who sold the circus to Judge Roy Hofheinz of Houston and Washington DC promoters Irvin Feld and Israel Feld in 1967. In 1991, John and Mable Ringling and his sister, Ida Ringling North, were exhumed from their original resting places and reburied at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, just in front and to the right of the Ca d'Zan. It is called the secret garden and John is buried between the two women. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus eventually closed after 146 years; in the face of weakening attendance, animal rights protests, and high operating costs, it performed its final show on May 21, 2017, at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.

Introduced during the second season, he became the primary antagonist of the third season.  Background  The Carver is introduced in the episode \\"Naomi Gaines\\" as a masked serial rapist who disfigures, and rapes his victims; he has also killed one victim: Rhea Reynolds, a woman who faked being attacked by the Carver so she could get free plastic surgery. He becomes upset after Dr. Sean McNamara (Dylan Walsh) performs corrective plastic surgery on one of his victims. He attacks McNamara in his bathroom and cuts one side of his face. He then threatens to kill McNamara if he \\"fixes\\" any more of the Carver's \\"masterpieces\\". McNamara continues to do so, and in the second-season cliffhanger, the Carver exacts revenge by attacking and raping Dr. Christian Troy (Julian McMahon), McNamara's associate. Before raping his victims, and/or carving their cheeks down to the lip to resemble a smile (a \\"Glasgow smile\\"), the Carver tells his victims, \\"Beauty is a curse on the world,\\" sometimes adding, \\"It keeps us from seeing who the real monsters are.\\" Motives  The Carver apparently believes that physical beauty is evil and feels compelled to destroy it. He has referred to beauty as a type of prison or cage that people are trapped in and believes it necessary to free such a craftsman's pride in his or her work. He also considers his resulting disfigurements \\"art\\" ‚Äì a new kind of beauty to grace the world. =Victims of the carver= *Two unknown victims prior to episode \\"Naomi Gaines\\" *Naomi Gaines (2.07 Naomi Gaines) *Mr Rourke (2.15 Sean McNamara) *Unknown female victim (2.15 Sean McNamara) *Sean McNamara (2.15 Sean McNamara) *Christian Troy (2.16 Joan Rivers) *Rhea Reynolds (3.04 Rhea Reynolds- attacked) *Kit McGraw (3.05 Granville Trapp) *Kimber Henry *Nine sorority girls (3.15 Quentin Costa) *Quentin Costa (3.15 Quentin Costa) performed by Kit McGraw *Gina Russo (3.15 Quentin Costa) Quentin Costa Dr. Quentin Costa, portrayed by Bruno Campos, is ultimately revealed as Carver. Quentin Costa is introduced in the episode \\"Sean McNamara\\" as a plastic surgeon from Atlanta, Georgia. He is brought in to assist Christian Troy in fixing Sean McNamara's face (a slash to the right side of his face) after an attack by The Carver, a masked serial rapist preying on individuals who would ultimately become Sean and Christian's patients. In the third season, Sean offers Quentin a limited partnership after Christian neglects to return to work after being attacked by the Carver. Initially, Christian refuses to accept having Quentin as an associate, but later changes his mind and supports the decision. A couple of episodes later, he and Sean go to a frat party together. They end up receiving fellatio from two college girls, during which Costa winks at Sean. This bothers Sean and he leaves the room. In the same episode Christian asks Costa to help take Kit McGraw (Rhona Mitra) off his hands because he is tired of the three-way relationship with her and Kimber Henry (Kelly Carlson). While in bed with Kit on one side and Christian and Kimber on the other he reaches over and touches Christian's buttocks. Costa later explains that he is bisexual, and assumed Christian was as well. After Sean briefly leaves the practice, Costa remains to assist Christian with surgeries. Later Christian believes that Costa is on drugs and calls Sean to assist with the facial transplant surgery they are working on. Sean later returns to the practice. Following Sean's return to the practice, both Costa and Sean admit their hatred for each other after the former enters a relationship with Sean's ex-wife Julia (Joely Richardson). After catching Costa having sex with a married male patient (a corporal), Sean blackmails him in an attempt to force him to quit the practice. Costa allows McNamara/Troy to buy out the rest of his contract at half price, only to then reveal he is staying in Miami to become the resident plastic surgeon at De La Mer, under the employment of Julia McNamara. He is later fired after an argument with Julia. When Julia discovers she is pregnant, Sean and Christian suspect that Costa is the father. This is later proven false, as Costa (never knowing Julia was pregnant) admits to Christian that they never had sex. The child is now assumed to be Sean's. At the end of episode 3.14 (\\"Cherry Peck\\"), it is revealed that Costa does not have a penis. Early in the next episode he attributes this to a genetic disorder known as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency that he suffers as a product of incest.  Unmasking  The Carver unmasked; Quentin Costa and his co-conspirator/sister Kit McGraw The third season's finale (Episode 3.15, \\"Quentin Costa\\") revealed the Carver to be Quentin Costa, with assistance from his sister, Kit McGraw. = Exegesis: Summary of Episode 3.15 = Detective Kit McGraw brings Dr. Quentin Costa in for questioning, suspecting him to be the Carver; she subsequently finds that, due to a medical condition, Costa was born with no penis. Since all of the Carver's victims were raped, Costa is released. The Carver attacks a group of nine sorority girls. During questioning, one victim recounts walking in on the Carver raping her sorority sister, and was able to see that the Carver did not have a real penis, but rather was wearing a strap-on dildo. Kit and the police storm Costa's apartment only to find Costa tied to his bed, bearing the trademark cheek slashes of The Carver, and the message \\"I can't stop\\" written in blood on the wall behind him. Once again exonerated from the suspect pool, Costa asks Christian and Sean to repair his face. After initially refusing, Christian and Sean agree to perform the surgery. During this conversation, Costa explains away some potential plot holes from earlier in the season. Specifically: * When Sean witnessed Costa receiving oral sex at a college party, Costa explains how he paid the girl $100 to pretend to perform fellatio on him. * When Costa was beginning to have 4-way sex with Christian, Kit and Kimber, he intentionally grabbed Christian's buttocks so he could end the session early and thus retain his secret. During Costa's operation, Kit arrives with a S.W.A.T. team and arrests Liz Cruz (Roma Maffia), McNamara/Troy's anesthesiologist, as the next prime suspect. During the interrogation, Kit explains the evidence against Liz: * A search warrant of Liz's house led to the discovery of a strap-on dildo. * A receipt for an order of the same drugs the Carver uses on his victims was found at McNamara/Troy with Liz's signature on it. * Liz has been visiting numerous area sperm banks and therefore could have obtained Christian's sperm and planted evidence that led to Christian's arrest as a suspect earlier in the season (it is known by the viewers that Liz received a sample directly from Christian in Season 2, but not mentioned by Kit). Liz attests her innocence during questioning. Sean checks up on Quentin in recovery. Gina, carved but not dead, is the body in Quentin's bed ‚Äî seen only by the audience. The Carver suddenly appears behind Sean, injects him with the paralyzing agent and unmasks ‚Äî revealing himself to be none other than Quentin Costa. Sean awakens to find both Christian and himself tied to separate operating tables. Costa cuts off Sean's pinky finger and attempts to force Christian to cut off his own hand. Just before Christian is about to do it, Kit arrives and shoots Costa in the back. Kit tells paramedics to make sure the autopsy on Costa's body is not started without her. At police headquarters, Kit explains to Christian and Sean that Gina (who was at the office to drop off a Christmas gift for Christian) called 9-1-1, which is why Kit showed up. Kit then explains Quentin's life story. Costa was born with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a debilitating disease that left him with no penis. He also had a sister, Violet, who suffered severe facial disfigurement. Apparently both medical anomalies were a result of incest. After their parents abandoned them, the two lived in a convent in Maine. Quentin worked his whole life to become a plastic surgeon so he could fix his sister's face, but she died at the age of 29 during her final operation. Kit leaves Miami after closing the case. While talking to Gina, Sean and Christian discover that Gina never called 911, as she was completely paralyzed after being attacked by the Carver. In the morgue, we see a body laid out covered by a sheet. A hand removes the sheet to reveal Quentin Costa, who opens his eyes and sits up, revealing a bullet-proof vest beneath his black suit. \\"What took so long?\\" asks Costa. Christian and Sean take a Red-eye flight to Maine to visit the convent where Costa was raised. When they mention Violet's death, the Mother Superior is confused, explaining that Quentin's sister's name isn't Violet, it is Katherine; but Quentin always called her Kit. The Mother Superior then shows Sean and Christian a Christmas card that the pair sent her three years before, which includes a photo of Quentin and Kit. The Carver storyline ends with Quentin and Kit relaxing at a luxury hotel in M√°laga. Although Kit wants to take a brief vacation, Quentin is spurred on by the sight of a woman with breast implants. The scene ends with a shot of the woman lying in a deck chair with Quentin and Kit's shadows hovering over her. = Correct guesses and a premature reveal= Prior to the finale, a few fans were able to correctly guess the identity of the Carver through the use of sound- editing programs. As a promotion for the show, FX set up a profile for the Carver on myspace.com, which included videos of the Carver espousing his philosophy. Within days, various tech-savvy audiophiles took the audio from these videos, filtered out the distortion from the Carver's voice synthesizer, and were able to reveal that at the very least, Campos was voicing The Carver.YTMND - The Carver is revealed! The Carver's identity was also leaked prematurely by none other than FX Networks. One day before the finale episode aired, the press section of the FX Networks website published three pictures which revealed the identity of the Carver. While the pictures were removed from the site later that evening, they had already been re-published on various fan-based message boards. Behind the scenes *The Carver's outfit is made by Prada. His top is a black zip-up sweater from the Winter 2004 collection. * Three knives were used for filming: A sharp, shiny one used for scenes in which the Carver is just brandishing the knife; a dull one for when the Carver \\"slashes\\"; and a dull one with a built in blood tube to create a bleeding effect when the knife is pressed against skin (this prop was used in the Season 2 episode in which Sean is carved). * There was only one Carver mask, custom molded from porcelain and resin. Because it was so fragile, a props manager was in charge of making sure it was handled properly every time it was on the set.USATODAY.com - Unmasking 'Nip/Tuck' devil * Bruno Campos wore brown contact lenses when playing the Carver to keep his blue eyes from being seen in the mask. * Joely Richardson lost a $100 bet to Campos over the Carver's identity. Apparently, she couldn't believe it would be him. He claims to have framed the cheque. Real-life similarities *The Carver's modus operandi is somewhat similar to the urban legend of the Smiley Gang, a group of six men who offered their victims the choice of being raped or having an \\"eternal smile\\" cut into their faces. This hoax, predominantly spread by email, spread fear among teens and their parents in both the Netherlands and Belgium in late 2003.Roel's Weblog - Gerucht over 'smiley-bende' houdt politie bezig The key difference is that the Carver offered his victims no choice; he both cut and raped them.

He is best known for his collection of sermons published in 1766 as Sermons for Young Women, popularly known as Fordyce's Sermons. Early life He was the third son of George Fordyce (1663‚Äì1733)Fordyce, David. Oxford DNB article. Retrieved on 2012-04-07. of Broadford, merchant and Provost of Aberdeen (who had twenty children); and was born at Aberdeen in the last quarter of 1720. David Fordyce was his elder brother, Alexander Fordyce and Sir William Fordyce were his younger brothers, and George Fordyce, M.D., was his nephew. After the Aberdeen High School Fordyce went to Marischal College, where he was educated for the ministry. On 23 February 1743 he was licensed by the Aberdeen presbytery. In September 1744 he was presented by the Crown to the second charge at Brechin, Forfarshire. His admission was delayed, when the parishioners stood out for their right of election; he was ordained at Brechin on 28 August 1745. His position was not comfortable, and he did not get on with his colleague. In 1753 he took his degree of M.A. at Marischal College, and in the same year he received a presentation to Alloa, Clackmannanshire. The parishioners wanted another man; however, Fordyce got a call on 5 June, demitted his charge at Brechin on 29 August, and was admitted at Alloa on 12 October 1753. Here he was on better terms with his congregation, and acquired a reputation as a preacher. He published several sermons; in 1760 his sermon before the General Assembly on the 'folly, infamy, and misery of unlawful pleasures' created an impression. The University of Glasgow made him a Doctor of Divinity. Preacher in London With several members of his family established in London, in 1760 he was chosen as colleague to Samuel Lawrence, D.D., minister of the presbyterian congregation in Monkwell Street. He demitted his charge at Alloa on 30 May, and was released from it on 18 June 1760. Lawrence died on 1 October, and Fordyce became sole pastor. He preached only on Sunday afternoons, the morning lecturer being Thomas Toller, Lawrence's son-in-law. Fordyce's delivery and gestures were studied, and he drew crowds to Monkwell Street. His topics were didactic, but he also satisfied cultured tastes, and dealt with the ethics of actual life. David Garrick was impressed; Fordyce associated with Samuel Johnson, and introduced him to Blair. He gave sympathetic account in Addresses to the Deity, 1785, of Johnson's religious character, speaking as an evangelical moderate. Fordyce's popularity lasted for about twelve years. Several causes contributed to its decline. In 1772 the banking failure of his brother Alexander involved the ruin of some adherents, and the loss of many friends. In 1775 the congregation was split by a quarrel between Fordyce and Toller, and Fordyce had Toller dismissed on 28 February 1775. A large part of the congregation moved with Toller to an independent meeting-house in Silver Street. Later life With a diminished congregation, and under medical advice, Fordyce resigned his office at Christmas 1782. His charge at the ordination of his successor, James Lindsay, D.D., on 21 May 1783, was highly regarded. He retired to a country residence near Christchurch, Hampshire, where he was a neighbour of Lord Bute, who gave him the use of his library. On the death (1792) of his brother, Sir William Fordyce, he removed to Bath, Somerset. He was troubled with asthma, and died suddenly of syncope on 1 October 1796 in his seventy-sixth year. He was buried in one of the parish churches of Bath; funeral sermon was preached by Lindsay at Monkwell Street on 16 Oct. He married (1771) Henrietta Cummyng, who died at Bath on 10 January 1823, aged 89. There was no issue of the marriage. One of his nieces was Elizabeth Isabelle Spence. Works He published: *'The Eloquence of the Pulpit,' &c.;, 1752, (ordination sermon; often reprinted with David Fordyce's ' Theodorus'). *'The Temple of Virtue,' &c.;, 1757, (by David Fordyce; but this edition has additional matter by James Fordyce). *'The Folly ‚Ä¶ of Unlawful Pleasures,' &c.;, 1760; 2nd edit. Edinb. 1768. *'Sermons to Young Women,' 1765, 2 vols., often reprinted. *'The Character and Conduct of the Female Sex,' 1776. *'Addresses to Young Men,' 1777, 2 vols. *'Addresses to the Deity,' 1785. *'Poems,' 1786. *'A Discourse on Pain,' 1791, (Chalmers refers to a certain 'cure for the cramp' here given, and connects it with a passage from Beaumont and Fletcher). Also a sermon on popery (1754), reprinted 1779; ordination sermon and charge (1755); sermon on Eccles. xi. 1 (1757); funeral sermon for Samuel Lawrence (1760); sermon on Prov. viii. 6, 7 (1775); charge at ordination of James Lindsay (1783). His book Sermons for Young Women was also published in an American edition (First Boston Edition) in 1796, by Thomas Hill, printers.

It has about 14,000 inhabitants. It lies on the river Elbe east of Prague on the D11 motorway. Etymology An ancient community and a small fortress originated near the ford. It is most likely that the position of this community is reflected in the present name of the town: Podƒõbrady - \\"pode brody\\" = below the ford. History The history of Podƒõbrady reaches back to medieval times. The first written mention is from 1223. A long-distance trade route running from Prague to eastern Bohemia and then on to Silesia and Poland passed through the then-forested landscape interwoven with a dense network of river branches. This important communication intersected the Elbe River to the west of the present town, at a place called Na Vinici. It obtained the status of town from the king of Bohemia in 1472. A historic milestone in the life of the town was the year 1905, when it was visited by the German estate owner Prince von B√ºlow. This well-known water diviner found in the inner courtyard of the castle signs of a strong spring, which was later bored to a depth of . The discovery of carbonic mineral water resulted in the opening of the first spa in 1908. After World War I Podƒõbrady rapidly changed into a spa town which from 1926 specialized in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, rapidly gaining renown not only in the Czech Republic, but also abroad in countries including Austria, Germany, Russia and the United States. Flag and Emblem The town acquired its emblem in 1472 from the sons of King George of Podƒõbrady. His description reads as follows: In a gold shield, a silver block wall, culminating with nine red-covered shades. In the middle of the wall, a gate with a black hole, a gold gate, and a golden grille, topped with silver spikes. Behind the wall stands a silver round tower with two oblong windows above it, a cornice in the middle, with a battlement of four shadows on its top, and a pointed red roof with a poppy. Behind the tower, as if standing on the wall, black-and-red eagle with golden armor, red tongue and silver crescent over breasts and wings. On the wall above the gate is a silver label with three black stripes in the upper half. The label is a sign of the Lords of Kun≈°t√°t, ie Ji≈ô√≠ of Podƒõbrady, an eagle and his descendants, the princes of M√ºnsterberk. The city flag was approved by the Decree of the Ministry of the Interior No. B-8117-25 / 11-47-II / 3 dated August 20, 1948. The aspect ratio is 2:3. Points of interest In Podƒõbrady attractions include lakes for swimming, a riding school and tennis courts. Near Podƒõbrady, there is a longwave transmitter used for transmitting meteorological reports. It uses a T-antenna mounted on two 150 m-tall guyed masts. The local golf course is located on the site of the transmitter. Spa The mineral water that was found in the early 1900s is better known as Podƒõbradka. The water contains iron deposits; if left over the course of a few days a rust-like deposit will settle at the bottom and will stain plastic bottles. There are four free public taps where people are able to obtain Podƒõbradka. There is also a refined version of Podƒõbradka that is not as heavy with the iron deposits that can be purchased from most stores in the Czech Republic. L√°znƒõ Podƒõbrady, a. s. (Spa Podƒõbrady, Inc.) is a Czech spa provider in Podƒõbrady. Since 1908, when mineral water ‚ÄúPodƒõbradka‚Äù was discovered, thousands patients have come to Podƒõbrady to treat their health problems and relax.

Unusually for a show car, the Pirana was commissioned by the Daily Telegraph, a leading British daily newspaper, as an example of an \\"ideal car.\\" Sir William Lyons was contacted beforehand about the project and agreed to sell Bertone the Jaguar engine and chassis. The car was originally registered \\"TGF 1F\\".

Early life and family Brady was born in New York City to an Irish immigrant family.Diamond Jim Brady: Prince of the Gilded Age He was born ‚Äúinto humble circumstances on the far lower West Side of Manhattan, the son of a saloon owner.‚Äù Career Brady worked his way up from bellhop and courier. After gaining employment in the New York Central Railroad system, he became the chief assistant to the general manager by the age of 21. At 23, Brady parlayed his knowledge of the rail transport industry and its officials to become a highly successful salesman for Manning, Maxwell, and Moore, a railroad supply company. In 1899 he became sales agent for the Pressed Steel Car Company. Lifestyle Known for his penchant for jewels, especially diamonds, he collected precious stones and jewelry in excess of US$2 million (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). Brady's enormous appetite was as legendary as his wealth, though modern experts believe it was greatly exaggerated. It was not unusual, according to the legend, for Brady to eat enough food for ten people at a sitting. George Rector, owner of a favorite restaurant, described Brady as \\"the best 25 customers I ever had\\". For breakfast, he would eat \\"vast quantities of hominy, eggs, cornbread, muffins, flapjacks, chops, fried potatoes, beefsteak, washing it all down with a gallon of fresh orange juice\\". A mid-morning snack would consist of \\"two or three dozen clams or Lynnhaven oysters\\". Luncheon would consist of \\"shellfish...two or three deviled crabs, a brace of boiled lobsters, a joint of beef, and an enormous salad\\". He would also include a dessert of \\"several pieces of homemade pie\\" and more orange juice. Brady would take afternoon tea, which consisted of \\"another platter of seafood, accompanied by two or three bottles of lemon soda\\". Dinner was the main meal of the day, taken at Rector's Restaurant. It usually comprised \\"two or three dozens oysters, six crabs, and two bowls of green turtle soup. Then in sumptuous procession came six or seven lobsters, two canvasback ducks, a double portion of terrapin, sirloin steak, vegetables, and for dessert a platter of French pastries.\\" Brady would even include two pounds of chocolate candy to finish off the meal. A gregarious man, Brady was a mainstay of Broadway nightlife. He often dined with popular society. After further investments in the stock market, Brady accumulated wealth estimated at $12 million, though not always by ethical means. According to biographer Harry Paul Jeffers, \\"On election night (1896), Brady won about $180,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars) by making crooked bets on the William McKinley‚ÄìWilliam Jennings Bryan presidential election.\\" He also enriched himself to the tune of $1.25 million (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars) through a shady stock deal involving the Reading Railroad. He was known for being the first person in New York City to own an automobile (in 1895). Thoroughbred racing Jim Brady owned and raced a significant stable of Thoroughbred horses which were trained by Matthew Allen. Among his top horses, Gold Heels was the Champion Older Male Horse of 1902 and Accountant was the American Co-Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse of 1906. In his obituary, the Daily Racing Form noted that his activities in racing helped make him a national figure. Personal life \\"Diamond Jim\\" is known for his longtime relationship with actress and singer Lillian Russell. It is said they would rendezvous at his home at 7 West 46th Street in Manhattan. It is said that her eating habits were a perfect match for his own. Brady donated a significant sum in 1912 to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, where he had once been treated. The hospital created the James Buchanan Brady Urological Institute in his honor. Brady never married, and after his death, his estate was distributed to many institutions, most notably New York Hospital. Now known as NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital, the department of urology still maintains the James Buchanan Brady Foundation. Death Brady died in his sleep on April 13, 1917, of a heart attack. When his body was examined, doctors discovered that his stomach was six times the size of that of an average person. Legacy Brady was the inspiration for a 1935 film written by Preston Sturges entitled Diamond Jim and might have inspired a character called \\"Big Jim\\" in the Bob Dylan song, \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\". In the 1940 film, Lillian Russell, Diamond Jim Brady is portrayed by Edward Arnold. Brady is mentioned in an episode of I Love Lucy titled \\"The Business Manager\\" (season 4, episode 1) ‚Äì (Ricky to Fred: \\"Mr. Hickox? He makes you look like Diamond Jim Brady!\\").https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0609345/?ref_=ttep_ep1 In 1968 film The Odd Couple, Oscar calles Felix \\"Diamond Jim Brady\\" when he orders tea for him at a late night diner while they are discussing his separation. Brady was the protagonist of the fictional film Bonjour, Diamond Jim that was featured in the film Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie (2012). A story about Brady is told in Kurt Vonnegut's novel Jailbird in which Brady, on a bet while dining at the Hotel Arapahoe, eats four dozen oysters, four lobsters, four chickens, four squabs, four T-bone steaks, four pork chops, and four lamb chops. The Season 5 episode \\"Lillian Russell\\" / \\"The Lagoon\\" of Fantasy Island involves a woman becoming Lillian Russell and being caught between the affections of Brady and another man. Brady inspired Monty Python's Flying Circus to create the fictional character Mr. Creosote who appears in the troupe's sketch comedy film The Meaning of Life (1983). The actor Howard Keel was cast as Brady in a 1963 episode of the TV series Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story, while traveling by train in Texas, Brady accepts a nearly impossible wager that he can sell $100,000 worth of barbed wire to area ranchers who oppose such fencing ‚Äì and can do so without leaving the train. Brady is featured in Caleb Carr's The Angel of Darkness near the end of a chapter; as the main characters arrive in Saratoga Springs, the narrator Stevie sees Brady dining with his paramour Lillian Russell, and notes that while neither Brady's manners nor language is all that pleasant, neither are Miss Russell's. In the 1964 movie What a Way to Go!, the character Louisa May Foster (Shirley MacLaine) said to herself on a flight on Rod Anderson Jr.'s (Robert Mitchum) jet that \\"he wasn't the Diamond Jim Brady of the Jet set.

The last permanent resident, Sigmund Remienko, died in 2004. Betoota is situated on a gibber plain (a stony desert plain) east of Birdsville and west of Windorah. The town has been designated as Australia's smallest. The only facilities in Betoota are a racetrack, a dry weather airstrip and a cricket field. Visitors are drawn to the town during the annual Simpson Desert Carnival which is held in September. History Karuwali (also known as Garuwali, Dieri) is a language of far western Queensland. The Karuwali language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Diamantina Shire Council, including the localities of Betoota and Haddon Corner. The town was surveyed in 1887, but only three streets were ever named. The Betoota Hotel was constructed in the late 1880s and is the last remaining building in town outside the race track. The building is constructed of sandstone and has timber floors. In 1885, the Queensland Government opened a customs post to collect a toll for stock travelling the stock route. Betoota was once a Cobb & Co change station. In 1895, a police presence was established in the town as construction of a rabbit-proof fence in the region was attracting many \\"undesirable characters\\" to the town. A police station with a court was built in 1915 but was closed in 1930 because an inspection in 1928 found no-one had been taken into custody or placed before the court in more than five years. The hotel operated until 1997, when its owner, Sigmund (Simon) Remienko, retired at 82 years of age. Originally from Poland, Remienko worked as a grader driver until he bought the Betoota Hotel in 1957. He owned it for 47 years, and was Betoota's sole resident until ill-health forced him to move. The hotel closed in October 1997. Remienko died in 2004. In 2017, Robert Haken, a smash repairer from Logan, bought the long-defunct hotel from the couple Remienko had left it to. It was being restored, with the aim of reopening in time for the Betoota Races in August 2018. However, that goal was not achieved, \\"due to paperwork\\". The Betoota Hotel re-opened on 20 July 2020. Status The town is now deserted, except for tourists in the dry season.

The book condenses months of flights into a single terrifying mission over the town of Arras. Saint-Exup√©ry was assigned to Reconnaissance Group II/33 flying the twin-engine Bloch MB.170.

O'Connor was involved in the design of a scheme that transported water to the Eastern Goldfields of Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie in the eastern part of Western Australia. The weir was completed in 1903. The lake created by the dam was known as the Helena River Reservoir, it was renamed as Lake C.Y. O'Connor in 2004. The owner of the dam, the Water Corporation, refers to the weir as Mundaring Dam on its website, but no other authority, such as Geographic Names, or Geosciences Australia uses this term. The Mundaring Shire uses an image of the Mundaring Weir in its logo. Work commenced to raise the dam in the late 1940s, and was completed in November 1951. In the early 1970s the downstream dam from the weir‚Äîthe Lower Helena Pumpback Dam‚Äîwas constructed. It last overflowed into the Helena Valley in 1996. Overflowing In the first fifty years overflows were a regular occurrence. The 1950s raising of the weir affected overflows, but they continued. In the 1960s the weir regularly overflowed. File:Mundaring weir overflowing in 1960s.jpg1965 Dam monitoring Like any structure of its age and design, the weir requires monitoring and repairs and maintenance. On the original structure the central small building was used for aspects of monitoring the weir's internal status ‚Äì it was rebuilt on the heightening of the dam, although it was no longer used for its original purpose. In 2009 two face wall entrance points were created on either side (north and south) of the face to facilitate access to the monitoring tunnels. The weir leaks, and the three photos below show consistent stain/moisture points between 2008, 2010 and 2020 where water moves through the structure: File:Mundaring_weir_11_gnangarra.JPG  2008 File:Mundaring Weir wall MAY 2010.jpg  2010 File:Mundaring Weir wall face in May 2020.jpg2020 Changes 2010‚Äì2014 A new pump station with an initial capacity of per day, and an ultimate capacity of per day, commenced operations in March 2014. The existing two pump stations, a substation and chlorination facility were decommissioned. New treatment facilities included pre-treatment, filtration, chlorination, stabilisation and fluoridation. The old facilities were not able to sustain increasing water demands and current Australian drinking water guidelines. Aesthetic water qualities such as colour, taste and odour had deteriorated over the years.  Railway  Mundaring Weir was the terminus of the Mundaring Weir Branch Railway, which was originally constructed by the Public Works Department of WA for the transport of materials for the construction of the dam. It was only after the completion of the weir that the location became popular with picnickers and sightseers, as the project caught the imagination of the public in Perth. The landscaped grounds of the weir, and the lower zig-zag section of the end of the railway line (which can still be seen when the capacity of the dams falls below approximately 35%) feature prominently in postcards of numerous weekend and special picnic excursion trains that travelled to the weir from the 1910s until the late 1940s. The steepness of the Mundaring weir railway line restricted the capacity of the railways to conduct the picnic trains, as the Msa Garratt steam engines were the most suitable, but in short supply, at times when the weir was overflowing in the 1940s. The railway line was closed in 1952. Additionally, a tramway, using timber rails, was constructed to convey sawn timber from a mill from the site of what is today known as The Dell in Paulls Valley to the weir from where it was railed on the above railway line. It opened in 1909 and closed in 1913.Wanderer, H (1970) 'Daring Rides on a Wooden Switchback' February 1970. pp.46‚Äì48, Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin. Facilities Helena river bed The old \\"Pumping Station Number 1\\" is now the C Y O'Connor Museum run by the National Trust. There is also the Kookaburra outdoor cinema, and the Department of Environment and Conservation has the Hills Forest activity centre, as well as a regional administrative office. Before rationalisation of its work force at this locality, the Water Authority of Western Australia's operations at the Weir maintained housing for its workers. There is a youth hostel (built at the site of the now defunct primary school), an art gallery in the area, and many picnicking spots. There is still rangers' housing at the site, along with functioning pumping stations and water treatment facilities. Bibbulmun Track The walking trail Bibbulmun Track commences in Kalamunda following Piesse Brook, then along the south side of the Helena valley. Crossing the weir wall the track follows the northern side of C.Y.O'Connor lake before turning south and continuing the journey to Albany. Golden Pipeline Project Lake C. Y. O'Connor from the air, looking southwest Mundaring Weir information sign The history and context of the whole Goldfields Water Supply Scheme was celebrated by the Golden Pipeline project, where the Water Corporation had the National Trust of Australia (WA) create an \\"interpretation\\" of the history of the scheme with guide books, trails, and web-sites to provide information about the history of the scheme. Most of this project was developed between 2001 and 2003.

He is a left-handed opening batsman who has played first-class cricket for New South Wales, Northamptonshire, Yorkshire and Worcestershire, as well as international cricket for Australia. Personal life He was married to the Australian women's soccer player Danielle Small from 2006 to 2009. He is now married to Jessica Jaques, and is the father to a son Samuel Jaques and daughter Charlotte Jaques. Early career and domestic success Jaques commenced his cricketing career whilst a student at Nareena Hills Public School in Wollongong. A junior with the Wests team in Wollongong he moved onto the Sutherland club while still attending Figtree High School to further his career. In 1999 Jaques was awarded a cricketing scholarship by New South Wales, which enabled him to spend the English summer playing for Northern Cricket Club near Liverpool. A last minute call up to the NSW team on 15 March 2001 for a match against Queensland saw him rush from Sydney to Brisbane where he arrived in time to debut at the unfamiliar number 10 position with the score at 70/8, up against a Queensland attack on a seaming green-top, he top scored with 40. After struggling to establish himself for New South Wales thereafter, Jaques transformed his career by signing for the English County Championship side Northamptonshire in 2003. He was prolific, hitting over 1200 runs including a double century and returned to NSW an established member of the Pura Cup Champions. 2003/04 saw the consolidation of Jaques' English form in Australia as he built a reputation of being a player who could score quickly but also occupy the crease for many hours. After returning to England to play for Yorkshire (1,118 runs in 2004 and 1,359 in 2005) and maintaining a consistent standard with New South Wales (1,191 runs in 2004‚Äì05), many were calling for his promotion to the national team. retrieved 16 November 2007 He went back to England to play for Worcestershire for the 2006 and 2007 seasons, where he scored 1689 runs in 18 matches. Uniquely for the current Australian test team, Jaques has played more first- class games overseas than he has in Australia (62 overseas, mainly in England, 51 in Australia as of 25 November 2007). His batting average in the English County Championship is also quite a lot better than his average in the Pura Cup (59.31 compared to 47.46 as of 25 November 2007). Eligibility Jaques was born to English parents, Stuart and Mary, and is a holder of a British passport. This made him eligible to play for both England and Australia. With Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer established at the top of the Australian batting line up, Jaques himself did not rule out qualifying to become an English player. However, his desire to play for Australia proved too strong, and his record-breaking form in the 2004‚Äì05 season led to his Australian international call-up. International cricket In 2005‚Äì06 a timely century in the Pura Cup followed three consecutive centuries in the ING Cup for New South Wales, and Jaques was selected for the Australian squad for the 2nd Test against South Africa starting on Boxing Day, 2005 in Melbourne after regular opener Justin Langer pulled a hamstring in the previous match. He was unable to capitalise however, making only 2 and 28. Jaques was given another chance making 66 in his second Test against Bangladesh in April 2006 after Langer was ruled out with concussion sustained in an earlier Test. Making his One-Day International debut for Australia against South Africa, Jaques made 94, falling six runs short of his maiden century. His innings broke a 23-year-old record of the highest score on debut for Australia in a One-Day International. In November 2006, Jaques scored successive centuries in three days against England, in the warm up to the 2006‚Äì07 Ashes series in Australia. His first, playing for a Prime Minister's XI, was an impressive 112. His second was 107, playing for New South Wales. However the selectors stuck with regular openers Hayden and Langer and Jaques was forced to bide his time with NSW. One year later, and following the retirement from international cricket of Justin Langer, Jaques was called up to the Test squad for the home series against Sri Lanka ahead of his rival for the place, Western Australia's Chris Rogers, in part due to a fluent second innings 167 in a Pura Cup match against Western Australia in which Rogers scored 9 and 17. Jaques took full advantage of his opportunity to start to cement a permanent opening slot in the Australian side by scoring his maiden test century in the first test at the Gabba. Jaques was dropped on 68 and 90 but made the most of these lives to notch up his first hundred at international level with a boundary off the first ball after a drinks break. His century came from 196 balls and included 14 fours, it having taken him 34 deliveries to get off the mark.Phil Jaques justifies call-up Cric Info retrieved 16 November 2007 He was dismissed without adding to his score just seven balls later, stumped by Prasanna Jayawardene off Muttiah Muralitharan.Aussies thrive on Jaques century BBC News retrieved 16 November 2007 One week later, Jaques impressed again by scoring 150 and 68 in the second test at the Bellerive Oval.Twin tons power Australia effort BBC News retrieved 16 November 2007 This was enough for him to be selected as Hayden's opening partner for the 2008 West Indies tour where he starred with a century in the final test at Bridgetown.

It brings democratic values to education and can include self-determination within a community of equals, as well as such values as justice, respect and trust. The history of democratic education spans from at least the 1600s. While it is associated with a number of individuals, there has been no central figure, establishment, or nation that advocated democratic education.Provenzo, E.F. Jr. (ed) (2008) Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. p 238. Democratic education is often specifically emancipatory, with the students' voices being equal to the teacher's. History Locke's Thoughts, 1693 =Enlightenment era= In 1693, John Locke published Some Thoughts Concerning Education. In describing the teaching of children, he declares, > None of the things they are to learn, should ever be made a burthen to them, > or impos'd on them as a task. Whatever is so propos'd, presently becomes > irksome; the mind takes an aversion to it, though before it were a thing of > delight or indifferency. Let a child but be order'd to whip his top at a > certain time every day, whether he has or has not a mind to it; let this be > but requir'd of him as a duty, wherein he must spend so many hours morning > and afternoon, and see whether he will not soon be weary of any play at this > rate.Locke, John (1692) Some Thoughts Concerning Education, para 73.1. Jean-Jacques Rousseau‚Äôs book of advice on education, √âmile, was first published in 1762. √âmile, the imaginary pupil he uses for illustration, was only to learn what he could appreciate as useful.Rousseau, Jean-Jacques (1904), Emile ou l‚Äô√©ducation, Garnier Fr√®res, Paris, page 197: ‚Äú. . si nous trouvons que ce travail n‚Äôest bon √† rien, nous ne le reprendrons plus.‚Äù He was to enjoy his lessons, and learn to rely on his own judgement and experience. ‚ÄúThe tutor must not lay down precepts, he must let them be discovered,‚ÄùRousseau 1904, page 22 ‚ÄúIl ne doit pas donner des pr√©ceptes, il doit les faire trouver.‚Äù wrote Rousseau, and urged him not make √âmile learn science, but let him discover it.Rousseau 1904, page 173: ‚ÄúQu‚Äôil n‚Äôapprenne pas la science, qu‚Äôil l‚Äôinvente‚Äù He also said that we should not substitute books for personal experience because this does not teach us to reason; it teaches us to use other people's reasoning; it teaches us to believe a great deal but never to know anything.Rousseau 1904, page 121: ‚ÄúSubstituer des livres √† tout cela, ce n‚Äôest pas nous apprendre a nous servir de la raison d‚Äôautrui; c‚Äôest nous apprendre √† beaucoup croire, et √† ne jamais rien savoir =19th century= While Locke and Rousseau were concerned only with the education of the children of the wealthy, in the 19th century Leo Tolstoy set up a school for peasant children. This was on his own estate at Yasnaya Polyana, Russia, in the late 19th century. He tells us that the school evolved freely from principles introduced by teachers and pupils; that in spite of the preponderating influence of the teacher, the pupil had always had the right not to come to school, or, having come, not to listen to the teacher, and that the teacher had the right not to admit a pupil, and was able to use all the influence he could muster to win over the community, where the children were always in the majority.Tolstoy, Leo, in \\"The School at Yasnaya Polyana\\" in Tolstoy on Education, translated by Leo Wiener (1967), University of Chicago Press, page 233 =20th century= Dom Sierot In 1912, Janusz Korczak founded Dom Sierot, the Jewish orphanage in Warsaw, which was run on democratic lines until 1940, when he accompanied all his charges to the gas- chambers of the Treblinka extermination camp.Korczak, Janusz (1991), Von Kindern und anderen Vorbildern, G√ºterslohe Verlagshaus (translated from the Polish), page 78.Korczak, Janusz (1979) Von Kindern und anderen Vorbildern, G√ºterslohe Verlagshaus, pages 82‚Äì83. Influential democratic schools Main building of the Summerhill School The oldest democratic school that still exists is Summerhill, in Suffolk, England, founded in 1921. It features voluntary class attendance and a School Meeting with broad powers. Sudbury Valley School, founded in Framingham, Massachusetts in 1968, has full democratic governance: The School Meeting manages all aspects of the school, including staff hiring and facilities. A \\"Sudbury school\\" is now a general class of school modeled after this original. The term Democratic Education originates from The Democratic School of Hadera, the first school in the world called a democratic school. It was founded in Israel in 1987 by Yaacov Hecht. It is a public school.Hecht, Yaacov (2010) Democratic Education: A beginning of a Story, Innovation Culture, . pp 57‚Äì68 The term has been embraced by alternative/open schools all over the world, predominantly following the foundation of IDEC ‚Äì the International Democratic Education Conference, which was first convened at the democratic school in Hadera. Free schools movement In the 1960s, hundreds of \\"free schools\\" opened, many based on Summerhill. However A.S. Neill, the founder of Summerhill, distanced himself from American Summerhill schools for not successfully implementing the philosophy of \\"Freedom, not license.\\"conversation between A.S. Neill and Mario Montessori, Redbook Magazine, Dec 1964, reprinted as \\"Radical Private Schools\\" in This Magazine is About Schools 1(1), Apr 1966, p18 Free school movement (including many schools based on Summerhill) became a broad movement in the 1960s and 1970s, but was largely renounced by the 1980s. Progressive education and Dewey's ideals did influence them, but only indirectly for the most part. Networks Networks supporting democratic education include: * The Alternative Education Resource Organization launched in 1989 to create a \\"student-driven, learner-centered approaches to education.\\" * The annual International Democratic Education Conference, first held in 1993. * The Australasian Democratic Education Community, which held its first conference in 2002. * The European Democratic Education Community was founded in 2008, at the first European Democratic Education Conference. * The R√©seau des √©coles d√©mocratiques au Qu√©bec, or R√âDAQ, was founded in 2012 in order to sponsor the creation of democratic schools in the province of Qu√©bec, Canada. * The Alliance for Self-Directed Education launched in 2016 to make Self-Directed Education a normal and accessible option for all families. * Democracy Matters, launched in 2009, is a UK alliance of organisations promoting education for citizenship, participation and practical politics IDEC 2005 named two core beliefs: self-determination and democratic governance. EUDEC has both of these beliefs, and mutual respect is also in their belief statement. IDEN supports schools that self-identify as democratic. Variety Democratic education, same as a Democracy or a democratic government, comes in many different forms. These are some of the areas in which democratic schools differ. =Curriculum= Democratic schools are characterized by involving students in the decision-making process that affects what and how they learn. Democratic schools have no mandatory curriculum, considering forced learning to be undemocratic. Some democratic schools officially offer voluntary courses, and many help interested students to prepare for national examinations so they gain qualifications for further study or future employment.For example, Summerhill and the Kapriole Some democratic schools have no official offering of courses, although courses can be offered or requested by school members. =Administrative structure= Democratic schools often have meetings open to all students and staff, where everyone present has a voice and sometimes an equal vote. Some include parents. These school meetings can cover anything from small matters to the appointment or dismissal of staff and the creation or annulment of rules, or to general expenditure and the structure of the school day. At some schools all students are expected to attend these meetings, at others they are voluntary. The main school meeting may also set up sub-committees to deal with particular issues, such as conflict resolution. =Conflict resolution= Within the purview of democratic values, there is wide scope for how conflicts are resolved. There may be a formal system, with due process and the rule of law. There may be rules but no punishments. Other possibilities include, but are not limited to, a consensus process, mediation, and informal dialogue. =Other= Finance: Some democratic learning environments are parent-funded, some charity-funded. Schools may have a sliding scale based on family income. Publicly funded democratic schools exist in Canada and Israel. Size: Democratic schools vary in size from a few students to a few hundred. Even an individual unschooler can be described as learning democratically, if they are treated with democratic values. Age range: Age mixing is a deliberate policy in some democratic schools. It may include very young children, even babies. Some democratic schools only enroll older students. Location: Democratic education is not limited to any particular setting. Settings for democratic learning communities include in an office building, on city streets, and in a rural area. Theory While types of democratic education are as numerous as types of democracy, a general definition of democratic education is \\"an education that democratizes learning itself.\\"Gould, E. (2003) The University in a Corporate Culture. Yale University Press. p 224. The goals of democratic education vary according to the participants, the location, and access to resources.Williams-Boyd, P. (2003) Middle Grades Education: A Reference Handbook. ABC-CLIO. p 296. There is no unified body of literature, spanning multiple disciplines, on democratic education. However, there are theories of democratic education from the following perspectives: =Cognitive theory= During the practice theory movement, there was renewed interest in child development. Jean Piaget's theory of universal steps in comprehension and general patterns in the acquisition of knowledge was challenged by experiences at democratic schools. \\"No two kids ever take the same path. Few are remotely similar. Each child is so unique, so exceptional.\\"Greenberg, D. (1987) \\"Learning,\\" Free at Last ‚Äî The Sudbury Valley School. Retrieved August 13, 2010. Jean Lave was one of the first and most prominent social anthropologists to discuss cognition within the context of cultural settings presenting a firm argument against the functionalist psychology that many educationalists refer to implicitly. For Lave, learning is a process undergone by an actor within a specific context. The skills or knowledge learned in one process are not generalizable nor reliably transferred to other areas of human action. Her primary focus was on mathematics in context and mathematics education. The broader implications reached by Lave and others who specialize in situated learning are that beyond the argument that certain knowledge is necessary to be a member of society (a Durkheimian argument), knowledge learned in the context of a school is not reliably transferable to other contexts of practice. John Locke argues that children are capable of reasoning at a young age: ‚ÄúIt will perhaps be wonder‚Äôd, that I mention reasoning with children; and yet I cannot but think that the true way of dealing with them. They understand it as early as they do language; and, if I misobserve not, they love to be treated as rational creatures, sooner than is imagin‚Äôd,‚Äù, paragraph 81 Rousseau disagreed: ‚ÄúUse force with children and reasoning with men.\\", p63 Humans are innately curious, and democratic education supports the belief that the drive to learn is sufficiently strong to motivate children to become effective adults. Criticism based on cognitive theory The human brain is not fully developed until adulthood. A disadvantage of teenagers being responsible for their own education is that \\"young brains have both fast- growing synapses and sections that remain unconnected. This leaves teens easily influenced by their environment and more prone to impulsive behavior\\". =Ethics= Democracy can be valued on ethical grounds.H. Kelsen, Ethics, Vol. 66, No. 1, Part 2: Foundations of Democracy (October , 1955), pp. 1‚Äì101 Cultural theory Democratic education is consistent with the cultural theory that \\"learning in school must be continuous with life outside of school\\" and that children should become active participants in the control and organization of their community. Research on hunter-gatherer societies indicates that free play and exploration were effective transmitters of the societies' culture to children.Gray, P. Nature‚Äôs powerful tutors: The educative functions of free play and exploration. Eye on Psi Chi, 12 (#1), 18‚Äì21. 2007. According to George Dennison, democratic environments are social regulators: Our desire to cultivate friendships, engender respect, and maintain what George Dennison terms ‚Äònatural authority‚Äô encourages us to act in socially acceptable ways (i.e. culturally informed practices of fairness, honesty, congeniality, etc.). Criticism based on cultural theory Children are influenced by many curricula beyond the school curriculum: TV curricula, advertisers' curricula, curricula of religious communities, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, encyclopedias etc. and therefore \\"one of the most significant tasks any school can undertake is to try to develop in youngsters an awareness of these other curricula and an ability to criticize them‚Ä¶it is utter nonsense to think that by turning children loose in an unplanned and unstructured environment they can be freed in any significant way. Rather, they are thereby abandoned to the blind forces of the hucksters, whose primary concern is neither the children, nor the truth, nor the decent future of ... society.\\" √âmile Durkheim argues that the transition from primitive to modern societies occurred in part as elders made a conscious decision to transmit what were deemed the most essential elements of their culture to the following generations. He concludes that modern societies are so complex‚Äîmuch more complex than primitive hunter-gatherer societies‚Äîand the roles that individuals must fill in society are so varied, that formal mass-education is necessary to instill social solidarity and what he terms ‚Äòsecular morality‚Äô. =Political theory= There are a variety of political components to democratic education. One author identifies those elements as inclusivity and rights, equal participation in decision-making, and equal encouragement for success. The Institute for Democratic Education's principles of democratic education identifies several political principles, * The interaction between democratic philosophy and education, * Pluralistic education, * School administration by means of democratic procedures, * Education based on respect for human rights, * Dialogic evaluation, * Dialogic relationships, and * Critical social thinking.\\"Course for consultants on democratic processes\\" , Institute for Democratic Education. Retrieved 1/13/09. Effect on quality of education The type of political socialization that takes place in democratic schools is strongly related to deliberative democracy theory. Claus Offe and Ulrich Preuss, two theorists of the political culture of deliberative democracies argue that in its cultural production deliberative democracy requires ‚Äúan open-ended and continuous learning process in which the roles of both ‚Äòteacher‚Äô and ‚Äòcurriculum‚Äô are missing. In other words, what is to be learned is a matter that we must settle in the process of learning itself.\\"Offe, Claus and Ulrich Preuss. ‚ÄúDemocratic Institutions and Moral Resources‚Äù ‚ÄúPolitical Theory Today.‚Äù David Held, ed. Cambridge: Polity, 1991, 168. The political culture of a deliberative democracy and its institutions, they argue, would facilitate more ‚Äúdialogical forms of making one‚Äôs voice heard‚Äù which would ‚Äúbe achieved within a framework of liberty, within which paternalism is replaced by autonomously adopted self-paternalism, and technocratic elitism by the competent and self-conscious judgment of citizens.\\"Offe, Claus and Ulrich Preuss. ‚ÄúDemocratic Institutions and Moral Resources‚Äù ‚ÄúPolitical Theory Today.‚Äù David Held, ed. Cambridge: Polity, 1991, 170‚Äì1. As a curricular, administrative and social operation within schools, democratic education is essentially concerned with equipping people to make \\"real choices about fundamental aspects of their lives\\"Blacker, D.J. (2007) Democratic Education Stretched Thin: How Complexity Challenges a Liberal Ideal. SUNY Press. p 126. and happens within and for democracy.Bridges, D. (1997) Education, Autonomy and Democratic Citizenship: Philosophy in a Changing World. Routledge. p 76. It can be \\"a process where teachers and students work collaboratively to reconstruct curriculum to include everyone.\\"English, L.D. (2002) Handbook of International Research in Mathematics Education. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p 21. In at least one conception, democratic education teaches students \\"to participate in consciously reproducing their society, and conscious social reproduction.\\"Gutmann, A. (1987) Democratic Education. Princeton University Press. p 321. This role necessitates democratic education happening in a variety of settings and being taught by a variety of people, including \\"parents, teachers, public officials, and ordinary citizens.\\" Because of this \\"democratic education begins not only with children who are to be taught but also with citizens who are to be their teachers.\\"Gutmann, A. (1987) p 99. Preparation for life in a democracy The \\"strongest, political rationale\\" for democratic education is that it teaches \\"the virtues of democratic deliberation for the sake of future citizenship.\\"Curren, R. (2007) Philosophy of Education: An Anthology. Blackwell Publishing. p 163. This type of education is often alluded to in the deliberative democracy literature as fulfilling the necessary and fundamental social and institutional changes necessary to develop a democracy that involves intensive participation in group decision making, negotiation, and social life of consequence. Civic education The concept of the hidden curriculum includes the belief that anything taught in an authoritarian setting is implicitly teaching authoritarianism. Thus civic education, if taught in a compulsory setting, undermines its own lessons in democracy.Portis, E. (2003) \\"Democratic Education and Political Participation,\\" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Philadelphia Marriott Hotel, Philadelphia, PA.

Another common belief, which supports the practice of compulsory classes in civic education, is that passing on democratic values requires an imposed structure.see, for example, Democratic Education by Amy Gutmann Arguments about how to transmit democracy, and how much and how early to treat children democratically, are made in various literatures concerning student voice, youth participation and other elements of youth empowerment.Mendel-Reyes, M.

SUNY Press. p 178. Standard progressive visions of education as collaboration tend to downplay the workings of power in society. If learners are to \\"develop a democracy,\\" some scholars have argued, they must be provided the tools for transforming the non-democratic aspects of a society. Democracy in this sense involves not just \\"participation in decision making,\\" a vision ascribed especially to Dewey, but the ability to confront power with solidarity.Mills, C. W. (2008) \\"The Sociological Imagination\\"Schutz, A. (2010) Social Class, Social Action, and Education: The Failure of Progressive Democracy. Palgrave. Economic theory Core features of democratic education align with the emerging consensus on 21st century business and management priorities. Such features include increased collaboration, decentralized organization, and radical creativity. =Curriculum theory= While democratic schools don't have an official curriculum, what each student actually does might be considered their own curriculum. Dewey John Dewey 1916 Democracy and Education, Macmillan was an early advocate of inquiry education, in which student questions and interests shaped curriculum, a sharp contrast to the \\"factory model\\" that began to predominate education during the 20th century as standardization became a guiding principle of many educational practices. Although there was a resurgence of inquiry education in the 1980s and 1990s Kathy Short, Jerome Harste, and Carolyn Burke 1996, \\"Creating Classrooms for Authors and Inquirers, 2nd edition\\", Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann the standards movement of the 21st century and the attendant school reform movement have squashed most attempts at authentic inquiry-oriented democratic education practices. The standards movement has reified standardized tests in literacy and writing, neglecting science inquiry, the arts, and critical literacy. Democratic schools may not consider only reading, writing and arithmetic to be the real basics for being a successful adult. A.S. Neill said \\"To hell with arithmetic.\\"conversation between A.S. Neill and Mario Montessori, Redbook Magazine, Dec 1964, reprinted as \\"Radical Private Schools\\" in This Magazine is About Schools 1(1), Apr 1966, p16 Nonetheless, there is a common belief that people will eventually learn \\"the basics\\" when they develop internal motivation.Mario Montessori, in conversation with A.S. Neill, Redbook Magazine, Dec 1964, reprinted as \\"Radical Private Schools\\" in This Magazine is About Schools 1(1), Apr 1966, p17 Furthermore, an educator implementing inquiry projects will look at the \\"next steps\\" in a student's learning and incorporate basic subject matter as needed. This is easier to accomplish in elementary school settings than in secondary school settings, as elementary teachers typically teach all subjects and have large blocks of time that allow for in-depth projects that integrate curriculum from different knowledge domains. Allen Koshewa Allen Koshewa 1999, \\"Discipline and Democracy: Teachers on Trial\\" Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann conducted research that highlighted the tensions between democratic education and the role of teacher control, showing that children in a fifth grade classroom tried to usurp democratic practices by using undue influence to sway others, much as representative democracies often fail to focus on the common good or protect minority interests. He found that class meetings, service education, saturation in the arts, and an emphasis on interpersonal caring helped overcome some of these challenges. Despite the challenges of inquiry education, classrooms that allow students to make choices about curriculum propel students to not only learn about democracy but also to experience it. Democratic education in practice =Play= A striking feature of democratic schools is the ubiquity of play. Students of all ages‚Äîbut especially the younger ones‚Äîoften spend most of their time either in free play, or playing games (electronic or otherwise). All attempts to limit, control or direct play must be democratically approved before being implemented. Play is seen as activity every bit as worthy as academic pursuits, often even more valuable. Play is considered essential for learning, particularly in fostering creativity. =Reading, writing and arithmetic= Interest in learning to read happens at a wide variety of ages. Progressive educators emphasise students' choice in reading selections, as well as topics for writing. In addition, Stephen Krashen \\"Stephen Krashen 2014 /The Common Core: A Disaster for Libraries, A Disaster for Language Arts, a Disaster for American Education Knowledge Quest 42(3): 37‚Äì45 (2014) and other proponents of democratic education emphasise the role of libraries in promoting democratic education. Others, such as children's author Judy Blume, have spoken out against censorship as antagonistic to democratic education, while the school reform movement, which gained traction under the federal initiative 'No Child Left Behind' and later under 'Race to the Top' and the Common Core Standards movement, emphasise strict control over curriculum. = Research into democratic education = * A study of 12 schools in the United Kingdom by a former school inspector indicates that democratic schooling produces greater motivation to learn and self-esteem among students. * A study done in Israel indicates that the decline in interest in science that occurs regularly in conventional schools did not occur in democratic schools. * Three studies done on students of Sudbury Schools in the United States of America indicate that students \\"have been highly successful in their higher education (for those who chose that route) and careers. They have gone on to all walks of life that are valued in our society and report that they feel advantaged because of the sense of personal responsibility, self-control, continued interest in learning, and democratic values they acquired at Sudbury Valley.\\" * Sands School in the United Kingdom was inspected in 2013 by Ofsted was found to be ‚ÄòGood‚Äô overall with a number of ‚ÄòOutstanding‚Äô features. No area of the provision was found to be less than \\"good‚Äô and all of the Statutory regulations (the school \\"Standards\\") were met in full. This is the same outcome as the previous inspection in 2010. Ofsted observed that taking part in decision-making process developed \\"exceptional qualities of thoughtfulness and the ability to offer balanced arguments\\". Good pupil achievements were found to be a \\"consequence of the democratic structures\\". Personal development was deemed to be \\"outstanding\\" because of the exceptional impact of the democratic principles. The inspector was particularly impressed with pupils‚Äô behaviour, noting that \\"lessons took place in an atmosphere of mutual respect\\" and that \\"visitors were greeted with interest and impeccable manners\\". * Alia College in Melbourne, Australia was in the top 5 Year 9 NAPLAN for Australian schools in Reading, Writing, Grammar and Punctuation abilities. * Albany Free School, in Albany, United States of America has treated students with ADHD far better than surrounding schools, giving them enough play time to render medication unnecessary. Education in a democratic society As English aristocracy was giving way to democracy, Matthew Arnold investigated popular education in France and other countries to determine what form of education suited a democratic age. Arnold wrote that \\"the spirit of democracy\\" is part of \\"human nature itself\\", which engages in \\"the effort to affirm one's own essence...to develop one's own existence fully and freely.\\" During the industrial age, John Dewey argued that children should not all be given the same pre-determined curriculum. In Democracy and Education he develops a philosophy of education based on democracy. He argues that while children should be active participants in the creation of their education, and while children must experience democracy to learn democracy, they need adult guidance to develop into responsible adults. Amy Gutmann argues in Democratic Education that in a democratic society, there is a role for everyone in the education of children. These roles are best agreed upon through deliberative democracy. The journal Democracy and Education investigates \\"the conceptual foundations, social policies, institutional structures, and teaching/learning practices associated with democratic education.\\" By \\"democratic education\\" they mean \\"educating youth...for active participation in a democratic society.\\" Yaacov Hecht claims that the Democratic Education, being an education that prepares for life in a democratic culture, it is the missing piece in the intricate puzzle which is the democratic state. Training programs Israel's Institute for Democratic Education and Kibbutzim College in Tel Aviv collaborate to offer a Bachelor of Education (B. Ed.) degree with a Specialization Certificate in Democratic Education. Student teaching placements are in both regular schools and democratic schools.The Institute for Democratic Education at Kibbutzim College Legal issues = The United Nations and democratic education = United Nations agreements both support and place restrictions on education options, including democratic education: Article 26(3) of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \\"Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.\\" While this in itself may allow parents the right to choose democratic education, Articles 28 and 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child place requirements on educational programs: Primary education is compulsory, all aspects of each student must be developed to their full potential, and education must include the development of respect for things such as national values and the natural environment, in a spirit of friendship among all peoples. Furthermore, while Article 12(1) of the Convention mandates that children be able to have input on all matters that affect them, their input will have limited weight, \\"due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.\\" =Summerhill= In 1999, Summerhill received a 'notice of complaint' over its policy of non-compulsory lessons, a procedure which would usually have led to closure; Summerhill contested the notice and went before a special educational tribunal. Summerhill was represented by a noted human rights lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC. The government's case soon collapsed, and a settlement was offered. This offer was discussed and agreed at a formal school meeting which had been hastily convened in the courtroom from a quorum of pupils and teachers who were present in court. The settlement guaranteed that future inspections of Summerhill would be consistent with Summerhill's educational philosophy.

He is a former university lecturer at Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and Thammasat University, and was the leader of the Democrat Party from 2005 until he resigned following the party's weak performance in the 2019 election. As leader of the second largest party in the House of Representatives, he was also leader of the opposition ‚Äì a position he held from December 2008 until his party's en masse resignation from the House on 8 December 2013. That same month, he was formally charged with murder resulting from a crackdown on demonstrators in 2010 that killed 90 people. Born in England, the United Kingdom, Abhisit attended Eton College and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Oxford. He was elected to the Parliament of Thailand at the age of 27, and promoted to Democrat Party leader in 2005, after his predecessor resigned following the party's defeat in the 2005 general election. Abhisit was appointed prime minister of Thailand on 17 December 2008, after the Constitutional Court of Thailand removed Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from office. At age 44, he was the country's youngest prime minister in more than 60 years. Abhisit became premier at a time of global economic turmoil and rising domestic political tensions. As prime minister, he promoted a \\"People's Agenda,\\" which focused primarily on policies affecting the living conditions of Thailand's rural and working class citizens.Global Asia, People's Agenda: The Way Forward for Thailand, Volume 2, Number 2, Fall 2007 He administered two economic stimulus packages: a US$40 billion, three-year infrastructure improvement plan, and a more than US$3 billion program of cash subsidies and handouts.Forbes, Thai Prime Minister Extolls Economic Turnaround, 24 September 2010 By 2010, the stock market and the value of the baht had rebounded to their highest levels since the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.

Abhisit's government faced major protests in April 2009 and April‚ÄìMay 2010. The military's crackdowns on protesters left many dead. Abhisit launched a reconciliation plan to investigate the crackdown, but the work of the investigation commission was hampered by military and government agencies. The Thai Army clashed with Cambodian troops numerous times from 2009 to 2010 in the bloodiest fighting in over two decades. The South Thailand insurgency escalated during Abhisit's government, and reports of torture and human rights violations increased. Having resigned the party leadership after the defeat the Democrats suffered in the parliamentary elections of 2011, Abhisit was re- elected as leader at a party assembly. In 2018, the Democrats held a contest for party leader in preparation for the upcoming election. Abhisit was re- elected party leader, beating former PDRC leader, Warong Dechgitvigrom, by approximately 10,000 votes. However, after a poor showing in the 2019 election, Abhisit resigned as party leader.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/former-thai-pm-abhisit- resigns-as-head-of-democrats-after-election- loss-11374536https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-election- abhisit/former-thai-pm-abhisit-resigns-as-head-of-democrats-after-election- loss-idUSKCN1R50L1 Early life and family Eton College Senamat gown (‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¢‡πå), and his wife, Dr Pimpen, wearing a Thai silk dress Mark Abhisit Vejjajiva was born in Princess Mary Maternity Hospital, Newcastle- upon-Tyne, England, United Kingdom. He studied in England from the age of eleven, where he attended Eton College. Abhisit earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics (PPE), first class honours, and a master's degree in economics from St John's College, Oxford. While studying in England, he went to Thailand several times, including a gap year trip in 1983 with classmate and future UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to the resort city of Chiang Mai and the island of Phuket. After moving to Thailand, he received a bachelor's degree in law from Thailand's Ramkhamhaeng University, and taught at Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and Thammasat University Faculty of Economics. He is fluent in both his mother tongue and English also having both dual Thai and British citizenship. His dual citizenship became a topic for the Thai parliamentary debates in early-2011.

They have two children: Prang Vejjajiva (daughter) and Pannasit Vejjajiva (son). Pannasit has suffered from autism since birth. After his majority, the Central Juvenile and Family Court adjudged him quasi-incompetent and placed him under the guardianship of Abhisit, his father, as from 3 September 2012.

The family name Vejjajiva was granted by King Rama VI to Abhisit's grandfather Dr. Long (‡∏´‡∏•‡∏á), together with Long's father Nai Jinsang (‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏à‡∏¥‡πä‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏™‡∏á), grandfather Nai Peng (‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πã‡∏á) and great-grandfather Nai Go (‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πà‡∏≠) while Dr Long was serving as an Army Medical Department sub-lieutenant () The Vejjajiva family came to prominence when Dr. Long, then styled Phra Bamrad Naradura, rose to public health minister and founded the Bamrad Naradura Hospital in Nonthaburi. The family name means 'medical profession'. Abhisit's father, Athasit (‡∏≠‡∏£‡∏£‡∏ñ‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ó‡∏ò‡∏¥‡πå) Vejjajiva, is a former president of Mahidol University and a member of the Royal Institute of Thailand.Journal of the Royal Institute of Thailand, Vol. 29 No. 3, April‚ÄìJune 2004 After the National Peace Keeping Council seized power in a military coup in 1991, the military junta appointed Abhisit's father Deputy Minister of Public Health.Political economy of tobacco control in Thailand ; Assembly XLVII Early political career =Entry into politics= Abhisit began his political career in the 1992 general elections that followed the coup, becoming a Bangkok MP for the Democrat Party. He was re-elected to the same seat in the 1995 and 1996 general elections. In the elections of 2001 and 2005, he returned to parliament as a Party List MP for the Democrat Party. He has served as Democrat Party spokesman, Government spokesman, Prime Minister's Deputy-Secretary General for Political Affairs, Chairman of the House Education Affairs Committee, and Minister to the Prime Minister's Office. =Education Reform= During his administration as Minister to the Prime Minister's Office, he was responsible for the national education act of 1999.https://asean.org/storage/2016/08/Thailand184.pdf =Democrat Party leader= Abhisit was first nominated for the position of Democrat Party leader in 2003, following the resignation of then-party leader and former- Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. However, he lost the bid in a close election with seasoned politician Banyat Bantadtan. Two years later, Banyat led the Democrat Party to an overwhelming defeat in the 2005 general elections. Banyat resigned following the elections and Abhisit was named the new party leader. 2006 elections In February 2006, then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra dissolved the House of Representatives and called for new elections in April. In response, Abhisit announced that the Democrats and other opposition parties would boycott the elections. They claimed the elections lacked legitimacy, and were an attempt by Thaksin to divert public attention from his tax free sales of the Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings. Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai Party won an overwhelming majority in the virtually uncontested April 2006 election. However, the elections also left 38 seats vacant in the House of Representatives, because some Thai Rak Thai candidates were unable to garner the constitutionally required minimum of 20% of the vote to hold office. In the ensuing political crisis, Thaksin announced he would step down as Prime Minister, and the Constitutional Court ultimately invalidated the election results. The Thai Rak Thai party charged the Democrats with bribing other small political parties into boycotting the April 2006 elections. An 11-member fact-finding panel headed by Deputy Attorney-General Chaikasem Nitisiri voted unanimously in June 2006 to recommend dissolving the Democrat Party, as well as Thai Rak Thai and three other parties, based on evidence that the Democrats bribed other opposition parties into boycotting the elections. In February 2007, candidates from the Progressive Democratic Party testified before the Constitution Tribunal that they were duped into registering for candidacy in the April elections. Three witnesses testified that Democrat leaders Thaworn Senniam, Wirat Kalayasiri, and Jua Ratchasi encouraged protesters to disrupt the registration of candidates during the by- elections after the April 2006 election. Prosecutors contended that the party tried to disqualify the election results and force continuous rounds of by- elections. The defence claimed that the witnesses were hired by the Thai Rak Thai party to discredit the Democrats. Ultimately, the Constitutional Court of Thailand acquitted Abhisit and the Democrats of bribery, and instead banned Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party for the same charges.The Left/Right Debate Thai Tribunal: Democrat Party Cleared Of Electoral Violations (Nasdaq) , 30 May 2007 2006 military coup On 19 September 2006, only weeks before the scheduled elections, the military seized power in the 2006 Thailand coup. Abhisit voiced his disapproval of the coup just hours before all political activities were banned: Abhisit and the Democrats supported the military junta's 2007 draft constitution on the grounds that rejecting it would give more power to the junta. Abhisit said the Democrat Party considered the new constitution similar to the 1997 Constitution, but with improvements as well as faults. \\"If we wanted to please the Council for National Security we would reject the draft so it could pick a charter of its own choosing. If we reject the draft, it will be like handing out power to the Council. We have come up with this stand because we care about national interest and want democracy to be restored soon,\\" he said. Abhisit said he would seek to amend the Constitution if he was named prime minister. 2007 elections The Democrat Party remained in the opposition after the December 2007 parliamentary election. In a parliamentary vote to select a new prime minister on 28 January 2008, Samak Sundaravej of the People's Power Party defeated Abhisit by a vote of 310 to 163. On 9 September 2008, Samak was removed from the post by the Constitutional Court for receiving payment as the host of a TV cooking program. In the crisis that followed, some Democrat Party members became leaders of the People's Alliance for Democracy, which organised a six- month-long demonstration and seized Government House, Don Muang Airport, and Suvarnabhumi Airport. Abhisit voiced displeasure at the sieges, but did not stop his deputies from their leadership of the PAD. The sieges ended after the Constitutional Court banned the People's Power Party. Army commander and co- leader of the 2006 coup, General Anupong Paochinda, allegedly coerced several PPP MPs from the Friends of Newin Group to defect to the Democrat Party, allowing Abhisit to be elected Prime Minister.The Nation, \\"‡∏™‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏¥\\" ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î‡πÉ‡∏à‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏£‡∏Å ‡πÄ‡∏ö‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏•‡∏∂‡∏Å‡∏õ‡∏°‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏¢‡∏¥‡∏á ‡πÇ‡∏¢‡∏á‡∏ó‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Æ‡∏±‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏≤, 1 May 2009 Upon becoming Premiere, Abhisit promised to enforce the rule of law and prosecute the 21 People's Alliance for Democracy leaders who were responsible for seizing Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi Airport. As of February 2010, arrest warrants still had not been issued for the airport seizures. On 24 February 2010, government prosecutors deferred a decision for the eighth time to decide whether to indict the nine leaders of the PAD over the 7-month long seizure of the Government House. However, as the PAD leaders did not voluntarily come to testify, the judge could not make the decision and the process was thereby delayed. Rise to Premiership Abhisit as Leader of the opposition (2008) When Thaksin called for new elections in April 2006, Abhisit said he was \\"prepared to become a prime minister who adheres to the principles of good governance and ethics, not authoritarianism.\\" On 29 April Abhisit announced his candidacy for prime minister at the Democrat Party annual convention. He promised a \\"People's Agenda\\", with education as the main focus. He used the campaign slogan \\"Putting People First\\". He also vowed not to privatise basic utilities such as water and electricity, and to nationalise state enterprises that Thaksin had privatised. Regarding core elements of the so-called \\"Thaksinomics\\", Abhisit promised \\"the benefits from certain populist policies, such as the 30-baht healthcare scheme, the Village Fund and the SML (Small Medium Large) scheme, will not be revoked but instead improved.\\" He later urged that Thaksin's popular 30-baht health care scheme should be replaced with a system where access to medical services was totally free. Abhisit stated that all future Democrat MPs would have to declare their assets and any involvement in private companies. (By law, only members of the cabinet needed to declare their assets.) Abhisit raised more than 200 million baht at the Democrat Party's 60th anniversary dinner. He outlined several energy policies, including increasing dividend payments from state-owned oil company PTT and using the funds to repay oil fund debts, and having state-owned electric utility EGAT absorb part of the rising fuel prices. Abhisit later outlined plans to reduce retail petrol prices by eliminating the 2.50 baht/litre tax used to maintain the government's oil fund. On 13 July 2006, Abhisit promised to deal with escalating violence in the South by putting problems in the southern provinces on the public agenda. Abhisit also promised many populist policies including providing free education, textbooks, milk, and supplemental foods for nursery school students, and increasing the minimum wage. Following the Constitutional Court of Thailand's removal of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej in 2008 for vested interests by taking a salary from a cooking show while being prime minister, Abhisit lost the National Assembly vote for prime minister by 163 votes to 298 for Somchai Wongsawat, ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra's brother-in-law. On 2 December 2008, the Constitutional Court banned the three government parties for electoral fraud, including the PPP, thus dissolving the governing coalition and paving the way for a Democrat-Party-led government. The court also removed Somchai from office and banned him from politics for five years due to his involvement in the scandal as one of PPP's executive board members. He was succeeded by a deputy. Abhisit at the Government House in 2009 After Somchai was removed and the PPP dissolved, the MPs of the parties which had been in coalition with the PPP forged a new coalition with the Democrat Party, which had been in opposition until then. Most of the defectors were MPs from the Friends of Newin faction of the PPP, as well as the Bhumjaithai Party, the Puea Pandin Party, the Chartthaipattana Party, and the Rum Chart Pattana Party. The defection of the powerful Friends of Newin Group came about due to the alleged coercion by Army Commander General Anupong Paochinda, a move that Senator Khamnoon Sitthisamarn called an \\"Anupong-style coup\\".The Nation, Question loom over new Prime Minister's legitimacy, 17 December 2008 The Democrat-led coalition was able to endorse Abhisit as Prime Minister. Abhisit became Prime Minister after winning a vote in parliament on 15 December 2008. Prime Minister of Thailand Abhisit with his political mentor Chuan Leekpai Abhisit was formally endorsed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej as Prime Minister on 17 December 2008. Key appointments in Abhisit's government included PAD leader Kasit Piromya as Foreign Minister, construction tycoon Chaovarat Chanweerakul as Interior Minister, and investment banker and former Abhisit classmate Korn Chatikavanij as Finance Minister. Massage parlor tycoon Pornthiva Nakasai was appointed Deputy Commerce Minister. Abhisit's government saw unemployment increase by 63 percent.MCOT, Thailand's January unemployment soars to 880,000, 17 March 2009 Thailand's government budget went into deficit for the first time since 2003. By 2010, the government's debt had bloomed and reached 4.8% of GDP, the largest budget deficit since the government of Chuan Leekpai. This was likely due to the decades of tense political situation in the country.Trading Economics, Thailand Government Budget, 27 February 2013 To help the people, Abhisit subsidised the price of diesel, LPG cooking gas, and household electricity. Public bus and train journeys were provided for free. Abhisit's information and communications technology (ICT) policy included increased censorship of Internet sites the government considered deemed offensive to the monarchy, cancellation of 3G 2.1 gigahertz spectrum licence auctions, and larger budgets for government-owned TOT. Wealth Upon his appointment as prime minister in 2008, Abhisit officially declared personal assets worth 51.8 million baht (nearly US$2 million). This had increased to 54.4 million upon leaving office. Given that Abhisit has never worked in the private sector, the vast majority of his wealth was either inherited or given to him. Criticisms In his political career, Abhisit has been accused of hypocrisy. Prior to Abhisit's planned speech at St John's College on 14 March 2009, Lee Jones, a researcher on international relations at Oxford University, sent a letter to the dean of St John's College, attacking Abhisit and his administration as \\"democratic hypocrites\\". Part of the letter read \\"Although it is understandable given his education at St John's, I do not believe it is appropriate to ask someone like him to address the Oxford community on the subject of 'democracy'. As you may be aware, the Abhisit administration has only come to power in Thailand following a period of naked manipulation of Thai politics by cynical political elites, including the leadership of Abhisit's own 'Democrat' Party.\\" Jones later clarified on his website that he had not intended to oppose the Thai PM and the event. Abhisit refused to resign as prime minister after a clash between government troops and anti-government protesters on 10 April 2010 had claimed the lives of at least 23 people and injured hundreds more.

Thoma Darmo was born as Mansour Darmo, son of Elisha and Shirine. He spent his childhood in Turkey and from 1919 in Iraq, becoming an ordained clergyman in 1921. He continued to serve in Iraq for 15 years. Then he moved to Syria where he served from 1936 to 1952.

In a schism against the Catholicos-Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai because of reform issues introduced by the Assyrian Church of the East as well as the hereditary system of the Patriarchate, he voiced his opposition. This resulted in a split from the Church (then headquartered in San Francisco, now headquartered in Erbil) and Mar Thoma Darmo became one of the founders of the Ancient Church of the East. Subsequently, after three years of the seat of the Ancient Church of the East remaining vacant (1964-1967), Mar Thoma Darmo was elected as Catholicos- Patriarch in October 1968.

The westernmost part of the highway is known as the South Bay Freeway, beginning at Interstate 5 (I-5) in National City and running along the Sweetwater River before ending at the intersection with SR 125 and Jamacha Boulevard near Spring Valley. SR 54 then resumes at SR 94 in Rancho San Diego as an undivided highway that leads to the city limits of El Cajon. County Route S17 (CR S17) connects the two portions of the highway; the center portion of SR 54 was never constructed. The first section of the freeway opened in 1963, east of I-805. The extension of the freeway west to I-5 was delayed to coincide with the construction of the Sweetwater River flood channel. While construction started in 1984, a court stopped the process for a few years, and this portion was not complete until 1992. The final section of freeway, which was upgraded from an expressway, opened in 2007, to coincide with the extension of SR 125 south to Otay Mesa. Route description SR 54 starts as a six-lane freeway from I-5 near the mouth of the Sweetwater River in National City. Both directions of the freeway are divided by the river; eastbound traffic traverses the south bank and westbound traffic traverses the north bank. The two sides join near the junction with I-805. The roadway continues east for several miles past the Westfield Plaza Bonita mall through suburban Paradise Hills in San Diego. As the freeway turns north in Bay Terraces, it merges with SR 125 north. The highways pass west of the Sweetwater Reservoir and Sweetwater Summit Regional Park, and the western segment of SR 54 ends at the Jamacha Boulevard exit in La Presa. Jamacha Boulevard veers northeast as an undivided highway through Spring Valley until it reaches Campo Road; it is only designated as County Route S17 (CR S17), while some maps do consider this part of SR 54. The eastern segment of SR 54 runs concurrently with SR 94 from Jamacha Boulevard east through the unincorporated, but commercially developed, area of Rancho San Diego, and follows Campo Road about east. Passing near Cuyamaca College, SR 54 and CR S17 continue northeast on six-lane Jamacha Road to El Cajon, while Campo Road and SR 94 split off to the southeast. East of Brabham Street, four-lane SR 54 continues through suburban development to where it currently ends at the El Cajon city limit, though Jamacha Road extends into the city to the route's previous terminus at the intersection with I-8. SR 54 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System (though SR 125 is), a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route has three different names, including Jamacha Road from Campo Road to East Main Street in El Cajon, South Bay Freeway from I-805 to SR 94, and the Filipino-American Highway from the western terminus to SR 125. In early 2012, the interchange with I-5 was among the top ten most congested segments of highway in California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) District 11, which includes the San Diego metro area. In 2014, SR 54 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 21,800 vehicles at the eastern end of the route, and 131,000 between I-805 and Reo Drive, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway. History The intersection of former SR 54 with I-8 The earliest road with a similar route to SR 54 was mentioned in newspapers in 1908, and was paved by 1935. The South Bay Freeway was constructed next as an expressway from National City to Spring Valley. The freeway west to I-5 and the Sweetwater River flood channel were built at the same time, although both were delayed due to environmental concerns and litigation. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, the entirety of the western portion of SR 54 was converted to a freeway, while the entire portion inside the El Cajon city limits was returned to that city. =Early construction= A road through Jamacha is mentioned in The San Diego Union as early as February 1908, and was oiled in 1935 from US 80 (Main Street) around El Cajon to Sweetwater Valley and in other places by the Sweetwater River. In 1956, the route of what would become the South Bay Freeway had been determined; it would run from Sweetwater Road in National City to Spring Valley and the intersection of Sweetwater Road and Jamacha Boulevard. Three years later, the California State Legislature added Route 280 from near the Sweetwater River to El Cajon to the state highway system. The South Bay Freeway was included in the county's 1960‚Äì1961 budget as the most important project. By 1961, E Street in Chula Vista continued along the Sweetwater River; it turned northeast and became Sweetwater Road before it entered into Lemon Grove. Bids were accepted in November 1962 for the part of the freeway from eastern National City and Valley Road to La Presa and Jamacha Road; it was to loosely parallel Sweetwater Road. This portion of freeway opened on September 27, 1963, and the entire project cost $2.25 million (about $ in dollars); however, although it was a four-lane freeway, it was declared as an expressway since all intersections were at-grade intersections. While the road was originally planned to have eight lanes, only four were constructed due to the additional cost. Meanwhile, SR 54 was officially designated in the 1964 state highway renumbering as the road from I-5 near the Sweetwater River to I-8 in El Cajon, replacing Route 280. The South Bay Freeway east of I-805 =Sweetwater River channel= SR 54 was extended west as a freeway to I-5 from I-805 at the same time the Sweetwater River flood control channel was built; the state proposed routing the flood channel in between the two roadways of the freeway in 1963, and it would also delineate the boundary between the cities of Chula Vista and National City. Later that year, the county proposed an extension of the freeway east to US 80 and Third Street in El Cajon. In 1966, the U.S. Army's Board of Engineers supported the construction of the flood channel, to protect future development in the surrounding region from floods; the integration of SR 54 was included in the proposal. Two years later, county officials expressed concerns over the delay of state and federal approval and considered building the freeway without the flood control component of the project. The county hoped to build both projects at the same time to save $4 million (about $ in dollars) in costs. This was since it was estimated to require three years' worth of legislation to be accomplished in a single year by the county board of supervisors in order to use the Interstate Highway System funds that were set to expire in 1972. Congress approved the project, but in late 1968, the target date for completion of the system would be pushed back two years. By 1971, the projected start of construction had slipped to within three to four years from then; however, Caltrans had approved the project. In July 1974, the California Coastal Commission unanimously decided to halt the entire project, since many of the necessary approvals from governmental bodies had not been obtained; this overrode an exemption granted by the San Diego Coast Regional Commission. Both the mayors of Chula Vista and National City were dismayed; Mayor Kile Morgan of National City stated that \\"we in the South Bay are getting tired of being kicked around\\", in reference to other stalled projects such as SR 157 and SR 125. Meanwhile, the interchange at I-805 was under construction, with completion scheduled for the next year. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife report predicted that the project would destroy of marshland and harm three bird species that were endangered, among other negative environmental consequences; the conclusions were disputed by local officials. In 1976, Caltrans said that SR 54 had not been included in plans for the next six years, due to a lack of funds and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. By 1980, the USACE was working to obtain funds, which was the major obstacle for completion; public concerns about the project were that it was not needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, after the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, financed by the USACE. Work on the part west of I-805 and the I-5 interchange started in May 1984, with the construction of a detour for I-5; USACE paid for some of the costs, and federal funds related to the Interstate Highway System were also used. That same year, the county agreed to create a wildlife preserve on of marshland to resolve the environmental concerns. Meanwhile, the existing part of the South Bay Freeway had become the \\"most dangerous five-mile stretch of highway in the county\\", as declared by the local fire chief, due to the 282 traffic accidents that had occurred on the road from 1977 to January 1985. By early 1986, the extension of the SR 54 freeway to El Cajon was declared a \\"lower priority\\" by Caltrans. That year, the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit that halted progress on the project the next year, due to concerns about damage to the least tern and light-footed clapper rail bird populations caused by the construction of a nearby hotel and the roads to it would have. Chief U.S. District Judge Gordon Thompson stopped the work because the preserve had not been created. It was estimated that the shutdown resulted in the state losing $25,000 (about $ in dollars) a day, as well as over 185 layoffs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service received of land in the Sweetwater Marsh from the Santa Fe Land Company to mitigate environmental damage, and the lawsuit reached a settlement. Construction resumed in early November 1989. The halt meant that the project had to be rebid; one bridge was partially completed, and was thus known as \\"the bridge to nowhere\\". The eastbound roadway opened to traffic on December 10, 1990, at an approximate cost of $89.3 million (about $ in dollars). In 1992, during the construction process, mastodon bones and stone hammers were found. The items were dated to be older than 120,000 years old and may be some of the earliest signs of human settlement in North America. Other animal bones were found at the site, near Reo Drive in National City, including those of a bison, a camel, a gopher, and horses. The westbound roadway was completed in July 1992. =Later developments= SR 94 westbound at the eastern intersection with SR 54 The expressway portion east of I-805 to South Worthington Street was upgraded to a freeway in the late 1990s, and an HOV lane opened in each direction, east of I-805 only. The first part from I-805 to near Woodman Street was finished in November 1993. The second part was to begin the construction phase in 1994; this was complete by 1998. The state legislature allowed for the relinquishment of SR 54 from the El Cajon city limit to I-8 to the City of El Cajon in 1999, and the transfer took place that year. The remaining expressway portion of SR 54 was replaced by a freeway in two phases in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The first phase corresponded with construction of SR 125 north of Jamacha Boulevard to SR 94; construction began in 1996 and was completed in 2003. The second phase consisted of the construction of the SR 125 toll road and opened on November 19, 2007. While California Transportation Ventures owned the franchise on the tolled portion of SR 125, the interchange with SR 54 was constructed with $160 million (about $ in dollars) of public finances. From 2005 to 2007, of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions to allow for the interchange to be built. The project to convert the HOV lanes to regular mixed traffic lanes was authorized in 2006. Caltrans determined that the lack of space for law enforcement to pull over carpool lane violators, as well as a missing barrier that separated the HOV lanes from regular traffic, made the lanes less effective. As of October 2014, Caltrans had considered relinquishing the eastern part of SR 54 from the SR 94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego. Two years later, the CTC approved a Caltrans proposal to revoke the proposed freeway status of the unconstructed portion of SR 54 since Jamacha Boulevard and the other existing roads would be able to handle the projected traffic load; this would allow the unused land to be sold.

The season occurs during the cold half of the year in each hemisphere. Influenza activity can sometimes be predicted and even tracked geographically. While the beginning of major flu activity in each season varies by location, in any specific location these minor epidemics usually take about three weeks to reach its pinnacle, and another 3 weeks to significantly diminish. Cause Three virus families, Influenzavirus A, B, and C are the main infective agents that cause influenza. During periods of cooler temperature, influenza cases increase roughly tenfold or more. Despite the higher incidence of manifestations of the flu during the season, the viruses are actually transmitted throughout populations all year round. Each annual flu season is normally associated with a major influenzavirus subtype. The associated subtype changes each year, due to development of immunological resistance to a previous year's strain (through exposure and vaccinations), and mutational changes in previously dormant viruses strains. The exact mechanism behind the seasonal nature of influenza outbreaks is unknown. Some proposed explanations are: * People are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person. * A seasonal decline in the amount of ultraviolet radiation may reduce the likelihood of the virus being damaged or killed by direct radiation damage or indirect effects (i. e. ozone concentration) increasing the probability of infection. * Cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate mucous membranes, preventing the body from effectively defending against respiratory virus infections. * Viruses are preserved in colder temperatures due to slower decomposition, so they linger longer on exposed surfaces (doorknobs, countertops, etc.). * In nations where children do not go to school in the summer, there is a more pronounced beginning to flu season, coinciding with the start of public school. It is thought that the day care environment is perfect for the spread of illness. * Vitamin D production from Ultraviolet-B in the skin changes with the seasons and affects the immune system. Research in guinea pigs has shown that the aerosol transmission of the virus is enhanced when the air is cold and dry. The dependence on aridity appears to be due to degradation of the virus particles in moist air, while the dependence on cold appears to be due to infected hosts shedding the virus for a longer period of time. The researchers did not find that the cold impaired the immune response of the guinea pigs to the virus. Research done by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in 2008 found that the influenza virus has a butter-like coating. The coating melts when it enters the respiratory tract. In the winter, the coating becomes a hardened shell; therefore, it can survive in the cold weather similar to a spore. In the summer, the coating melts before the virus reaches the respiratory tract.  Timing  Seasonal variation in deaths due to influenza or pneumonia in 122 U.S. cities, as a proportion of all causes.CDC U.S. influenza season summary with weekly updates See section 'Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I;) Mortality Surveillance' www.cdc.gov, accessed 30 September 2020 In the United States, the flu season is considered October through May. It typically reaches an apex in February, with a seasonal baseline varying between 6.1% and 7.7% of all deaths. In Australia, the flu season is considered May to October. It usually peaks in August. Flu seasons also exist in the tropics and subtropics, with variability from region to region. In Hong Kong, which has a humid subtropical climate, the flu season runs from December to March, in the winter and early spring. Flu vaccinations Flu vaccinations are used to diminish the effects of the flu season and can lower an individual's risk of getting the flu by about half. Since the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have winter at different times of the year, there are actually two flu seasons each year. Therefore, the World Health Organization (assisted by the National Influenza Centers) recommends two vaccine formulations every year; one for the Northern, and one for the Southern Hemisphere. According to the U.S. Department of Health, a growing number of large companies provide their employees with seasonal flu shots, either at a small cost to the employee or as a free service.Knock Out Flu at Work - Washington State Department of Health www.doh.wa.gov, accessed 5 October 2020 The annually updated trivalent influenza vaccine consists of hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein components from influenza H3N2, H1N1, and B influenza viruses. The dominant strain in January 2006 was H3N2. Measured resistance to the standard antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine in H3N2 has increased from 1% in 1994 to 12% in 2003 to 91% in 2005. Associated health complications Pediatric deaths from influenza 2011‚Äì2014 - a small fraction of the overall number of flu deaths in the U.S. each year, most of which occur in elderly people. Medical conditions that compromise the immune system increase the risks from flu. =Diabetes= Millions of people have diabetes. When blood sugars are not well controlled, diabetics can quickly develop a wide range of complications. Diabetes results in elevated blood sugars in the body, and this environment allows viruses and bacteria to thrive. If blood sugars are poorly controlled, a mild flu can quickly turn severe, leading to hospitalization and even death. Uncontrolled blood sugars suppresses the immune systems and generally lead to more severe cases of the common cold or influenza. Thus, it has been recommended that diabetics be vaccinated against flu, before the start of the flu season. =Lung disease= The CDC recommends that people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) be vaccinated against flu before the flu season. People with asthma can develop life-threatening complications from influenza and the common cold viruses. Some of these complications include pneumonias, acute bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Each year flu related complications in the USA affect close to 100,000 asthmatics, and millions more are seen in the emergency room because of severe shortness of breath. The CDC recommends that asthmatics are vaccinated between October and November, before the peak of the flu season. Flu vaccines take about two weeks to become effective. =Cancer= People with cancer usually have a suppressed immune system. Moreover, many cancer patients undergo radiation therapy and potent immunosuppressive medications, which further suppresses the body's ability to fight off infections. Everyone with cancer is highly susceptible and is at risk for complications from flu. People with cancer or a history of cancer should receive the seasonal flu shot. Flu vaccination is also strict for lung cancer patients, as cancer leads to complications of pneumonia and bronchitis. People with cancer should not receive the nasal spray vaccine. The flu shot is made up of inactivated (killed) viruses, and the nasal spray vaccines are made up of live viruses. The flu shot is safer for those with a weakened immune system. Those who have received cancer treatment such as chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within the last month, or have a blood or lymphatic form of cancer should call their doctor immediately if they suspect they may have flu. =HIV/AIDS= Individuals who have HIV/AIDS are prone to a variety of infections. HIV weakens the body's immune system, leaving sufferers vulnerable to viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoa disorders. People with HIV are at an increased risk of serious flu-related complications. Many reports have shown that individuals with HIV can develop serious pneumonias which need hospitalization and aggressive antibiotic therapy. Moreover, people with HIV have a longer flu season and are at a high risk of death. Vaccination with the flu shot has been shown to boost the immune system and protect against the seasonal flu in some patients with HIV.  Cost  During the 2011‚Äì2014 seasons, flu-like illnesses have typically accounted for 6% of outpatient visits at the peak of the season in the United States. The cost of a flu season in lives lost, medical expenses and economic impact can be severe. In 2003, the World Health Organisation estimated that the cost of flu epidemics in the United States was US$ 71-167 billion per year. A 2007 study found that annual influenza epidemics in the US result in approximately 600,000 life- years lost, 3 million hospitalized days, and 30 million outpatient visits, resulting in medical costs of $10 billion annually. According to this study, lost earnings due to illness and loss of life amounted to over $15 billion annually and the total economic burden of annual influenza epidemics amounts to over $80 billion. Also, in the US the flu season usually accounts for 200,000 hospitalizations and 41,000 deaths. Because the mortality rate of the H1N1 \\"swine flu\\" is lower than common flu strains, this number was actually lower in 2009. According to an article in Clinical Infectious Diseases, published in 2011, the estimated health burden of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1), between April 2009 to April 2010, was \\"approximately 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3‚Äì89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (195,086‚Äì402,719), and 12,469 deaths (8,868‚Äì18,306)\\" \\"in the United States due to pH1N1.\\" Notable occurrences The 2012‚Äì2013 flu season was particularly harsh in the United States, where the majority of states were reporting high rates of influenza-like illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the available flu vaccine was 60% effective. It further recommended that all persons over age 6 months get the vaccine. According to one source, the season 2014-2015 saw a particularly heavy prevalence of influenza in the United Kingdom.

First published in 1964 by McClelland and Stewart, it is perhaps the best-known of Laurence's series of five novels set in the fictitious town of Manawaka, Manitoba. In parallel narratives set in the past and the present-day (early 1960s), The Stone Angel tells the story of Hagar Currie Shipley. In the present, 90-year-old Hagar struggles against being put in a nursing home, which she sees as a symbol of death. This narrative alternates with Hagar looking back at her life. Plot summary In a series of vignettes, The Stone Angel tells the story of Hagar Shipley, a 90-year-old woman struggling to come to grips with a life of intransigence and loss. The themes of pride and the prejudice that comes from social class recur in the novel. As a young girl she refuses to rock her dying brother in the garments of their mother. As a young woman she marries Brampton Shipley against her father's wishes, severing the family ties. She shows favouritism towards her younger son, John. After Hagar separates from her husband, Hagar takes John with her. However, he ultimately returns to his father. When John dies, Hagar does not cry, and at that point, she turns into a \\"Stone Angel\\". Later in life, her elder son Marvin is shown to have been the good and loyal son all along, despite the lack of his mother's favour, It is he at the age of 64 along with his wife Doris who takes care of her. As a 90-year-old woman, Hagar goes on an unexpected adventure into the woods alone. Given her age, there is an overtone that this event will be the last chapter of her life. In the woods, she meets another wanderer. The two have a bonding conversation, where Hagar finally opens up. A lifetime of buried emotion comes out, and she finally cries. The next day the police and Marvin come to rescue Hagar from the woods. In an act of love and repentance, she confesses to Marvin that he was the better son. It is unclear whether she dies at the end of the novel. Literary significance and criticism Amongst other titles by Laurence, The Stone Angel is consistently listed as one of the greatest Canadian novels ever written. The novel has often been a part of school and university curricula. In the 1970s and 1980s, some Canadian school boards were pressured to ban her novels, including The Stone Angel. Recognition and adaptations James W. Nichol adapted The Stone Angel first for radio and then for stage. The radio drama, which premiered in 1989, was broadcast in six parts on CBC Radio's Morningside. The stage play premiered in 1991 at the Blyth Festival under the direction of Brian Richmond and starring Barbara Chilcott as Hagar. Nichol's play has subsequently been performed in 1993 with Theatre Passe Muraille under the direction of Maureen White, by the Canadian Stage Company in 1999, and by the King's Town Players in 2014, among others. The Stone Angel was one of the selected books in the 2002 edition of Canada Reads, where it was championed by Leon Rooke. In 2007, it was adapted into a movie, The Stone Angel, filmed in Winnipeg and Hartney, Manitoba. The film stars Ellen Burstyn, Dylan Baker, Ellen Page and Kevin Zegers.

John E. Morby, \\"The Sobriquets of Medieval European Princes\\", Canadian Journal of History, 13:1 (1978), p. 9. was the count of Barcelona, Girona, and Ausona from 1018 to his death. He was the son of Ramon Borrell, Count of Barcelona, Girona, and Ausona and his wife Ermesinde of Carcassonne.Mark Gregory Pegg, A Most Holy War : The Albigensian Crusade and the Battle for Christendom, (Oxford University Press, 2008), 4. He accepted the suzerainty of Sancho the Great of Navarre. Berenguer Ramon as a historical figure is enigmatic, shrouded in incomprehensible contradictions and ambiguities. First, he was a man of peace, and peace ruled throughout his reign. He pacified his neighbours as well, bringing to heel the Count of Urgell, Ermengol II.Adam J. Kosto, Making Agreements in Medieval Catalonia: Power, Order, and the Written Word, (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 31-32. He reestablished amicable relations with Hugh I, Count of Emp√∫ries, and maintained them with and Wilfred II of Cerdanya. He was a son of the church who maintained relations with the papacy and went on a pilgrimage to Rome in 1032. On many occasions he travelled to Zaragoza and Navarre to discuss with Sancho III the Great, King of Navarre their mutual stance against the Counts of Toulouse. His confidantes and councillors were the Abbot Oliva, the judge , , and and Deudado of Barcelona. In 1025, he decreed that the proprietors of entails (men holding land in fee tail) were free from taxation. On the other hand, the government of Berenguer Ramon I marks the beginning of the decline of the comital power. At the death of his father in 1018, Berenguer Ramon was a minor and his mother Ermesinde served as regent until 1023. But even when he attained his majority, his mother would not relinquish the powers of regency and reigned with him. According to some chroniclers, Berenguer's character left some things to be desired. He is described as weak and indecisive. Moreover, his policy of peace with the Moors was a bone of contention with the noblesse, who saw war with the Muslims as a way of obtaining glory, wealth, and possibly even salvation. This led some nobles to act independently of the count's wishes. Ermesinde, contra her son, was energetic and decisive, intent on imposing the authority of Barcelona on the baronage. But, as a woman, her capability to exercise control of the military was greatly impeded and organizing a raid or expedition to satisfy the wants of the aristocracy was virtually impossible. The weakening of comital authority became evident shortly before his death in 1035, when Ermesinde successfully partitioned his patrimony among his sons. Berenguer Ramon died on 26 May 1035 and was buried in Santa Maria de Ripoll. Marriages and children In 1021, Berenguer married the king of Navarre's sister-in-law, , daughter of Sancho Garc√©s, Count of Castile.Brian A. Catlos, The Victors and the Vanquished: Christians and Muslims of Catalonia and Aragon, 1050-1300, (Cambridge University Press, 2004), 74. By her he had two sons: * Ramon Berenguer (born 1023), who received the county of Girona (with his mother) and the county of Barcelona as far as the river Llobregat. * (birth date unknown), who received the frontier march from the Llobregat to the al-Andalus, which constituted the new county of Pened√®s with its capital in Ol√®rdola.Per Cingolani, p. 95, Berenguer's will reads: \\"I concede to my son Sancho the same county of Barcelona with the city of Ol√®rdola from the river Llobregat as far as the land of the pagans\\" (concedo ad filium meum Sancium ipsum comitatum Barchinonensem cum ipsa civitate de Olerdula de flumine Lubricato usque ad paganorum terram). Sometime between 1041 and 1049, San√ß swore fealty to his elder brother. Then, on 9 June 1050, he ceded his inheritance to Ramon, who in return granted him some lands and men as a fief.Kosto (2004), p. 79. San√ß then entered the church, first as a monk at Saint-Pons-de-Thomi√®res and then as the prior of Sant Benet de Bages, before it became an abbey.Stefano Maria Cingolani (ed.), Gestes dels comtes de Barcelona i reis d'Arag√≥ (Universitat de Val√®ncia, 2008), pp. 94‚Äì95. In 1027, Berenguer married as his second wife ,Theresa M.

Typical Dachshund races are either 25 or 50 yards in length, and are run on various surfaces. Many race tracks across America host these events as fundraising or publicity events, and routinely draw the venues' largest attendance numbers of the year. In the less formal events, most entrants are not career racers, nor bred for racing. Often, dogs will choose not to run the length of the course and instead visit with other dogs or the owner that released them. Otherwise, dogs will run swiftly to their owner at the finish line, coaxed by food or toys. The de facto national championship of wiener dog racing is the Wienerschnitzel Wiener Nationals, held in San Diego, California, every December as part of the Holiday Bowl; however, there are many other venues that claim title to the true \\"national\\" champion. History Dachshund racing was first held in Australia in the 1970s. The early meets featured Whippet, Afghan Hound, and Dachshund racing, purely for fun. The UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine in California holds an annual Doxie Derby as part of the university's Picnic Day event.Ternus-Bellamy, A. UC Davis may be the home of the Aggies, but on Picnic Day, it seems it‚Äôs all about the dogs. Davis Enterprise April 17, 2008. For over 30 years the races have been a fundraiser for veterinary students.School of Veterinary Medicine Doxie Derby big crowd pleaser at UC Davis Picnic Day. UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. April 15, 2008. The sport rose in popularity in North America after a 1993 Miller Lite television commercial that listed odd sports, and continued to grow after the release of Wiener Takes All, a documentary film that chronicles two years of the Wiener Nationals circuit.Dogs in a hurry. The Economist. May 2, 2009. pg. 45. In 2009, the Wiener Dog Nationals in Fort Wayne, Indiana, held its 16th annual Dachshund race. Zeus, the Germanfest champ from 2006-2009, is generally recognized as the greatest racing dachshund of all time. Germantown, Tennessee, a suburb of Memphis, also hosts its own 'Running of the Wienies' for charity. In 2016, the town of Bungendore in New South Wales, Australia held the inaugural Werriwa Wiener Dash to raise funds for Dachshund Rescue Australia. On 29 January 2017, the second Werriwa Wiener Dash was held which set the record for the most number of dachshunds in one place outside of a dog show with 154 dachshunds in attendance. The sport was introduced to Canada in 2018 with the launch of an annual race at Fort Erie Race Track, which proved a major success for the track. Criticism While some compare the sport to English and later American Greyhound racing, others see it as cruel and risky. Racing can strain the spines of the dogs, and some suspect that the sport can lead to the abuse of racing animals. The Dachshund Club of America opposes dachshund races, because the breed has a genetic predisposition to back injuries.

Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc., 426 F.3d 1001 (8th Cir. 2005), is a trademark case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the name of one of the largest ice cream truck franchise companies in the United States was neither distinctive nor famous enough to receive protection against being used in a violent video game. Background Frosty Treats, Inc. is the name of \\"one of the largest ice cream truck street vendors\\" in the United States. Their trucks uniformly feature a \\"Frosty Treats\\" logo, typically surrounded by the logos of various frozen snacks sold by the vender. Another feature of the trucks is the \\"Safety Clown\\", an image of a clown pointing children towards the back of the vehicle. In the mid 1990s, Sony released Twisted Metal 2, a video game that allows players to wreak havoc on simulated streets with a variety of vehicles - including an ice cream truck prominently featuring a logo that says \\"Frosty Treats\\". The video game ice cream truck is driven by a crazed clown known as Sweet Tooth, one of many featured in the game. Lawsuit Frosty Treats, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Sony contending that the game infringed on the company's trademarks through the use of the phrase, \\"Frosty Treats\\", as well as similarities between the video game clown and the company's own safety clown. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri granted summary judgment to Sony and dismissed the case, holding that the name could not be protected because it was generic. U.S. District Judge Scott Wright stated in his May 19, 2005 dismissal that \\"the various depictions of the Sweet Tooth character in defendant's Twisted Metal games and plaintiff's Safety Clown are so dissimilar that no reasonable trier of fact could conclude that they are confusingly similar.\\" Additionally, the court noted that the safety clown could not be protected because it was functional; it directed children to cross behind the van rather than in front of it. Frosty Treats appealed the dismissal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 15, 2005. Opinion of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, holding that the name was indeed generic. Judge Morris S. Arnold wrote that, although the Eighth Circuit rejected the finding that the safety clown was functional, they held that it nonetheless lacked distinctiveness in the marketplace such that it would merit protection. Furthermore, the Court noted such striking dissimilarities between the company's clown and the game clown that no consumer would be likely to confuse the two.

Average Sunday circulation in September 2004 was 26,747. The newspaper is locally owned by Consolidated Publishing Company, which is controlled by the Ayers family of Anniston. The paper was first published in 1883 as the Anniston Evening Star. It traces its modern history to 1911, when managing editor Col. Harry M. Ayers left to start his own paper, the Anniston Hot Blast‚Äîa nod to Anniston's roots as a steel town. By 1912, the Hot Blast had become Anniston's largest newspaper, and was more than large enough to absorb the Evening Star. Although the merged paper was initially called the Anniston Hot Blast and Evening Star, the Hot Blast name was eventually dropped. Early on, the Star gained a reputation as one of the few liberal-minded Southern newspapers. It was one of the few progressive Southern papers to support Franklin D. Roosevelt during all four of his election campaigns. In 1948, it broke with the Dixiecrats, who had taken over the Democratic machinery in Alabama, and supported Harry Truman for president. H. Brandt Ayers took over the paper from his father in 1965. Under the younger Ayers' watch, the Star reversed its initial skepticism toward the Civil Rights Movement and strongly supported school integration, one of the few Southern papers to do so. George Wallace derisively nicknamed the paper The Red Star for its support of integration. It has consistently remained one of the more liberal newspapers in a state that has grown increasingly friendly to Republicans. The Star is Consolidated's flagship paper. Other newspapers printed by the company include The Daily Home, and the weeklies The Cleburne News, the St. Clair Times, and the News Journal. The Star is a community newspaper and the dominant source of retail advertising in the region. Its online edition offers the content of the print edition, along with syndicated articles from Consolidated's network papers. Controversy On January 2, 2018, former publisher Brandt Ayers admitted that he assaulted Wendy Sigal in her Anniston home in the 1970s. Wendy Sigal was a reporter who worked at the newspaper in 1973 and 1974. He admitted he spanked her, but it was with advice of a doctor. Veronica Pike Kennedy claimed that Ayers spanked her in the Star‚Äôs newsroom in 1975 and Ayers seemed to confirm it.

Pedology is not commonly recognized as a distinct field of study; therefore, many people who would be described as pedologists are instead described as pedagogues, psychologists, pediatricians, etc. Another factor that contributes to paedology's lack of recognition as a distinct field of study is because one could make contributions to the field of pedology while also making contributions to other fields. For example. Jean Piaget made contributions to the study of pedology in his theories of the cognitive development of children; however, Piaget has more commonly been recognized as a developmental psychologist. Origins of Paedology The origins of this trend in psychology and pedagogy go back to the end of the 18th century with the separation of a branch of psychology that would form the basis of pedagogy, a pedagogic psychology or \\"experimental pedagogic psychology\\", \\"experimental pedagogy\\", \\"experimental education\\". G. Stanley Hall (1844-1924) fostered pedology as a separate study, and also became instrumental in the development of modern educational psychology. An American researcher, Oscar Chrisman, proposed the term \\"pedology\\" in 1893. At the end of the 19th century, pedology as a comprehensive study of the child came to prominence in Europe as an attempt to create a study of children in the manner of natural sciences. In 1909 Professor Kazimierz Twardowski organized a Pedological Society in Lviv, Austro-Hungary (now Ukraine). In 1910 a similar society was organized in Krak√≥w. In 1911 the first World Congress in Pedology took place in Brussels, Belgium, with attendants from 22 countries. World War I (1914-1918) effectively put an end to the development of this study in Western Europe. Since pedology as a branch of science never reached its maturity, there is no common established understanding as to the scope or instruments of pedology. Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland became the first university in the United States to offer a bachelor's degree in pedology. A 2014 document from the university refers to \\"the pedology major (now known as child and adolescent studies)\\". At many universities in the United States, pedological study is generally classified under the major \\"child development.\\"  Pedology in the Soviet Union In Imperial Russia a prominent developer of the field was Aleksandr Nechayev (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ù–µ—á–∞–µ–≤) in St. Petersburg, who in 1901 created the laboratory of experimental pedagogical psychology. Soviet pedology is traditionally thought to be founded by the efforts of Vladimir Bekhterev; in particular, in 1918 he founded the Institute of Pedology as part of psychological institutions united into the Institute for Study of Brain and Psychical Activity. This science was intensively pursued in 1920s-1930s in the Soviet Union. A journal Pedologiya (\\"–ü–µ–¥–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è\\") was issued. Lev Vygotsky was one of its prominent supporters. While many works of pedologists were of considerable value, the approach was severely criticized for over-enthusiastic but poorly grounded approach of testing for predicting a child's mental development, in addition to estimating its status. It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of VKP(b) Central Committee \\"On Pedological Perversions in the System of Narkomproses\\" on July 4, 1936. References *Depaepe, M.

Eight national teams affiliated with the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) took part in the competition. Defending champions Lithuania hosted the tournament, held in Kaunas Sports Hall. Tickets The prices for tickets were high at the time: The price for a seat was 2.5‚Äì5 LTL, and for a standing spot 1.5‚Äì2 LTL. Venue Kaunas Sports Hall EuroBasket 1939 ticket One of the toughest question was where the competition games of the Third European Basketball Championship should be played. First European Championship was held in a primitively adapted exhibitions hall, second ‚Äì in adapted former factory premises. Firstly, there was a thought to organize it in an open-court with a hanging tarpaulin roof, protecting from the rain, in the that time State Court (currently Darius and Girƒónas Stadium). Although, such building wasn't suitable nor for the Lithuania, nor for the FIBA. It was decided to build completely new sports hall for the basketball games. Anatolijus Rozenbliumas projected the new basketball hall with capacity of 11.000 people (3.500 seats). It cost around 400.000 LTL, however nobody complained about its necessarily and its building progress. Kaunas Sports Hall was built in time. Many helpers participated in construction. One of them, Donatas Banionis, remembers: \\"I remember 1939 European Championship in Kaunas. Then the Kaunas Sports Hall was built. On the eve of the tournament I learned from friends that helpers are required to number the benches. Free observation of the games was promised for that. This, for us ‚Äì boys, was a staggering thing. The cheapest ticket to all the games cost 10 LTL. So I numbered the sports hall benches with dye honestly\\".Stanislovas Stonkus \\"Krep≈°inio kelias ƒØ LietuvƒÖ\\" (pages: 33-35) Opening and closing ceremonies The opening ceremony of the EuroBasket 1939 took place on May 21, 1939. Independent Lithuania sport historian, Jonas Narbutas, wrote: \\"The interest in the competition, of course, was huge. But still it was hardly imaginable that even that big event may attract such wide masses. It seemed that the whole Kaunas swam into the National Stadium. Tides of people attended the Vytautas hill: by foot, by driving. Generations of times swam into the hall: near the gray-headed there was his aging son with his children, small and big swam, of all ages and castes. The hall possibly sheltered 10.000 of people. It is doubtful that more could fit there. It was possible to sell 20.000 tickets to the opening and the closing ceremonies\\".Stanislovas Stonkus \\"Krep≈°inio kelias ƒØ LietuvƒÖ\\" (pages: 37-38) The opening ceremony was started by the Lithuanian president Antanas Smetona speech. Teams and their compositions Postage stamp with the planned participants flags. At first, after sending the invitations, 17 countries wished to compete. Even the basketball newcomers Great Britain, Turkey, and Germany planned to participate in it. Because of this, one of the issued postage stamp had 17 countries flags.Stanislovas Stonkus \\"Krep≈°inio kelias ƒØ LietuvƒÖ\\" (page: 32) Though, when Kaunas was waiting for the guests from all the European countries, World War II phantom was already wandering in Europe. That changed things, with some of the 17 planned countries no longer interested in participating in the tournament. Eight teams arrived. Despite that, all the strongest teams of the EuroBasket 1937 participated (Lithuania, Italy, France). The championship prestige was also raised with the very capable Baltic teams participation (Latvia, Estonia). Most of the teams arrived at Kaunas firmly strengthened: Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Italy national teams had emigrants, who finished studies in the United States of America. Everyone was thrilled with the question: will tall (unlimited) height players participation be allowed? At that time FIBA had a rule which distributed players into two groups: lower than 1.90 meter and taller than 1.90 meter. Though, this rule never was used practically. Two teams had players taller than 1.90 meter: Estonia (Ralf Viksten ‚Äì 1.98 meter) and Lithuania (Pranas Lubinas ‚Äì 2.00 or 2.01 meter). Just one day before the competition, FIBA Technical Committee reached a decision allowing players of all heights to compete.Stanislovas Stonkus \\"Krep≈°inio kelias ƒØ LietuvƒÖ\\" (pages: 36-37) Gallery File:EuroBasket 1939 opening ceremony.jpgEuroBasket 1939 opening ceremony File:EuroBasket 1939 opening ceremony 2.JPGEuroBasket 1939 opening ceremony File:Eurobasket 1939 Lithuania-Hungary.jpgLithuania-Hungary game during EuroBasket 1939 Results The 1939 competition was in a very simple format. Each team played each of the other teams once. A win was worth 2 standings points, a loss worth 1. The rankings were based on those standing points. Ties were broken by head- to-head results. The winning team was Lithuania. In retrospect, the most important match was Lithuania vs Latvia in the first round. Lithuania won by 1 point, and this was the eventual winning margin of the championship. Relations between the two nations soured to such an extent that it led to the cancellation of the subsequent 1939 Baltic Cup football tournament. =Match results= ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- Final standings EuroBasket 1939 presidential prize.

It is also known as an anticube.Holleman-Wiberg. Inorganic Chemistry, Academic Press, Italy, p. 299. . If all its faces are regular, it is a semiregular polyhedron or uniform polyhedron. A nonuniform D4-symmetric variant is the cell of the noble square antiprismatic 72-cell.  Points on a sphere When eight points are distributed on the surface of a sphere with the aim of maximising the distance between them in some sense, the resulting shape corresponds to a square antiprism rather than a cube. Specific methods of distributing the points include, for example, the Thomson problem (minimizing the sum of all the reciprocals of distances between points), maximising the distance of each point to the nearest point, or minimising the sum of all reciprocals of squares of distances between points. Molecules with square antiprismatic geometry According to the VSEPR theory of molecular geometry in chemistry, which is based on the general principle of maximizing the distances between points, a square antiprism is the favoured geometry when eight pairs of electrons surround a central atom. One molecule with this geometry is the octafluoroxenate(VI) ion () in the salt nitrosonium octafluoroxenate(VI); however, the molecule is distorted away from the idealized square antiprism. Very few ions are cubical because such a shape would cause large repulsion between ligands; is one of the few examples. In addition, the element sulfur forms octatomic S8 molecules as its most stable allotrope. The S8 molecule has a structure based on the square antiprism, in which the eight atoms occupy the eight vertices of the antiprism, and the eight triangle-triangle edges of the antiprism correspond to single covalent bonds between sulfur atoms.  In architecture  The main building block of the One World Trade Center (at the site of the old World Trade Center destroyed on September 11, 2001) has the shape of an extremely tall tapering square antiprism. It is not a true antiprism because of its taper: the top square has half the area of the bottom one.  Topologically identical polyhedra = Twisted prism= A twisted prism can be made (clockwise or counterclockwise) with the same vertex arrangement. It can be seen as the convex form with 4 tetrahedrons excavated around the sides. However, after this it can no longer be triangulated into tetrahedra without adding new vertices. It has half of the symmetry of the uniform solution: D4 order 4.The facts on file: Geometry handbook, Catherine A. Gorini, 2003, , p.172 : 240px = Crossed antiprism= A crossed square antiprism is a star polyhedron, topologically identical to the square antiprism with the same vertex arrangement, but it can't be made uniform; the sides are isosceles triangles. Its vertex configuration is 3.3/2.3.4, with one triangle retrograde. It has d4d symmetry, order 8. :240px  Related polyhedra  =Derived polyhedra= The gyroelongated square pyramid is a Johnson solid (specifically, J10) constructed by augmenting one a square pyramid. Similarly, the gyroelongated square bipyramid (J17) is a deltahedron (a polyhedron whose faces are all equilateral triangles) constructed by replacing both squares of a square antiprism with a square pyramid. The snub disphenoid (J84) is another deltahedron, constructed by replacing the two squares of a square antiprism by pairs of equilateral triangles. The snub square antiprism (J85) can be seen as a square antiprism with a chain of equilateral triangles inserted around the middle. The sphenocorona (J86) and the sphenomegacorona (J88) are other Johnson solids that, like the square antiprism, consist of two squares and an even number of equilateral triangles.

History  The first federal judge in Texas was John C. Watrous, who was appointed on May 26, 1846, and had previously served as Attorney General of the Republic of Texas. He was assigned to hold court in Galveston, at the time, the largest city in the state. As seat of the United States District Court for the District of Texas, the Galveston court had jurisdiction over the whole state. On February 21, 1857, the state was divided into two districts, Eastern and Western, with Judge Watrous continuing in the Eastern district.Southern District of Texas: History of the District Judge Watrous and Judge Thomas Howard DuVal, of the Western District of Texas, left the state on the secession of Texas from the Union, the only two United States Judges not to resign their posts in states that seceded. When Texas was restored to the Union, Watrous and DuVal resumed their duties and served until 1870. In 1879, Texas was further subdivided with the creation of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, using territory taken from both the Eastern and Western districts.U.S. District Courts of Texas, Legislative history, Federal Judicial Center.

Plot Jack Simpson is a wisecracking, directionless layabout who works at an inner city telemarketing firm. For years he has been a member at the Cityside Lawn Bowls Club (in fact he has three memberships). But he has never played a single game, having only joined to get the free parking spaces from which he makes extra cash by renting them to his workmates. But Cityside is in dire financial trouble and a greedy developer, Bernie Fowler, wants to turn it into a soulless pokies venue. The Club President, Len, decides that all existing members must now play and Jack reluctantly has to turn up on Saturdays to take part in the bowling matches. Jack proves to be a natural player but he soon annoys and upsets the older club members with his brashness and lack of tact. Veteran player Stan, sensing that Jack only needs some guidance, both in the game and in life, takes him under his wing, trying to teach him to think of other people apart from himself. After losing his job and his girlfriend, the Bowls Club suddenly becomes all Jack has in his life and, despite himself, he grows fond of the older members. His flatmate, Dave, joins the club and he starts a relationship with Nancy, a journalist. Bernie, determined to take over the club, investigates Jack and exposes his illegal car park hiring scam, which almost gets him expelled. Cityside enters a major tournament at Bernie's glitzy club, the prize money from which will save their independence. Jack's selfish showboating almost costs them the first round but Stan and the others make Jack finally realise he is part of a team. Police arrive to arrest Len as (in a tip-off from Bernie) they discovered marijuana stored at the club. The greenkeeper has been secretly growing it but Jack is blamed by the other members. Dave and two of the ladies, Gwen and Eileen, approach the State Governor and convince her to overturn a lifetime ban on Cliff Carew, the club's best player, and the latter takes Len's place. Cityside fights their way into the lead and Stan throws the winning shot but he suffers a severe heart attack as he does so and Bernie lodges a protest, meaning the shot is disallowed. Jack insists that the rules allow the team a re-shot and he takes his special shot, the 'Flipper', which wins the tournament. To rub salt into the wounds, Nancy proves that whilst spying on the club, Bernie violated a restraining order banning him from the club, an illegal act which disqualifies Bernie from holding a gaming license. Cityside is saved and can continue in its old form. Stan passes away and the club names the green in his honour. The pot growing greenkeeper is sacked and Jack takes over his job and he and Nancy begin a new life with their friends at the club. The film's end credits feature a postscript with still images and a narration by Jack describing the later exploits of all the characters.

This is a broad comedy with a televisual style - including some dreadful mugging to camera - so who expected social critique as well? The movie is about Jack getting knocked off the donkey, like St Paul. Jack grows to manhood through bowls. This field of green becomes his Gallipoli, in a way, as a bunch of senior citizens teach him about honour, fidelity, and teamwork.' Megan Spencer, reviewing the film for Triple J, gave the film a positive review. 'Yes, Crackerjack is a familiar journeyman story, but it is one that rings true with some generously observed comedy and pathos, a film that unlike its Aussie cousins The Dish, Welcome To Woop Woop, The Castle, Siam Sunset etc. etc.‚Ä¶ it doesn't patronise its characters, nor over-exploit the 'middle Australia' culture in which it is set.' David Stratton, writing in Variety, was less enthusatic, referring to Crackerjack as 'a middling comedy which fails to live up to its explosive title....A pleasant enough screen personality, Molloy is, however, barely able to carry such a modest project... Stronger support comes from a fine ensemble of vets, especially saucy octogenarian Esme Melville; and John Flaus as the club's most enigmatic member.' When Crackerjack was first screened on free-to-air television, Network Ten ran station promotions over the film's end credits, obscuring most of the postscript narration by the character Jack. Mick Molloy was interviewed by ABC TV's Media Watch where he voiced his annoyance. Filming The main location for bowls scenes, including the greens, carpark, and interior rooms, were filmed at the Melbourne Bowling Club in Windsor, Victoria.as noted in the film credits Location shots of other bowls clubs included filming at the Carrum Bowling Club in the Melbourne suburb of Carrum. The Corowa Bowls Club in the NSW town of Corowa was also used for scenes featured in the finale. Box office Crackerjack grossed $8,618,107 at the box office in Australia. Crackerjack was the highest-grossing Australian film of the year and received two AFI Award nominations, for direction (Paul Moloney) and the screenplay (by Mick and brother Richard Molloy).

It is located in the center of the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia, communities linked by the Colonial Parkway. This area is one of the busiest tourist destinations in the world. Grove is located about east of Williamsburg along U.S. Route 60. Grove is bordered by the James River and separated from the Newport News city limits near Lee Hall by Skiffe's Creek. Historic places in Grove related to Virginia colonial past include the archaeological site of Wolstenholme Towne, the administrative center of Martin's Hundred. It was rediscovered in 1976 on the grounds of Carter's Grove Plantation, built in 1755. The plantation was occupied by private owners through the 1960s. It was owned and operated by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and open to the public from the 1970s until 2003. In 2007 the property was sold back into private ownership. Grove's contemporary development began with African- American settlement by freedmen from Carter's Grove and other plantations following the American Civil War. Its population was fewer than 100 people until after the turn of the twentieth century. During the two World Wars, Grove increased markedly in population. In part this was due to attracting hundreds of displaced people, mostly African American, who were uprooted by federal land acquisition for major waterfront military installations in nearby James City and York counties. Navy bases established were the Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, the Cheatham Annex supply complex, and Camp Peary. As of early 2008, many new homes were under construction in Grove. Along the southeastern edge, available sites and frontage on the James River and Skiffe's Creek are zoned for industrial purposes. These have been attractive to developers of new and expanded businesses.  Geography  Warwick County. Grove occupies part of the narrowest portion of James City County, bordering the James River to the south and York County to the north. With the exception of lowlands near the river, most of Grove was originally heavily wooded. Much of it still is. Grove Creek and Skiffe's Creek, each tributaries of the James River, provide local drainage. The latter also constitutes the eastern border of Grove (and the county), which adjoins the Lee Hall area of the independent city of Newport News. The former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) runs along the northern edge of Grove. It is now part of the Peninsula Subdivision of CSX Transportation.  Early history: 17th through 19th centuries  = Native Americans = For thousands of years, various cultures of indigenous peoples occupied areas along the waterways. Prior to the arrival of Spanish and English settlers in the 16th and 17th centuries, they were semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, although more complex civilizations arose among the Mississippian culture. Scholars believe a major historic American Indian village is located somewhere nearby, although the site has not been identified. The site of the historic Kiskiack Indian village, Chiskiack, was a few miles to the north. The Kiskiack were one of a number of Algonquian- speaking historic tribes at the time of encounter with the English. When the English settlers established Jamestown in 1607, the Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom included most Native tribes in the area. There were a few that were unaffiliated. The paramount chief, known as the Powhatan, had created his powerful empire in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He conquered or affiliated by agreement with approximately 30 tribes whose territory covered much of southeastern Virginia. This was called Tenakomakah. A capital of this confederacy, Werowocomoco, was located near the north bank of the York River in present-day Gloucester County, about as the crow flies from Grove. By the mid-17th century, the English had forced Native Americans remaining in the area on to reservations north of the York River. By working and living together, some had assimilated into the general population of European colonists and freed slaves of African heritage. Over the decades, white indentured servant women, African men, and few Indians married and created free mixed-race populations before the American Revolution.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1999-2005 = Martin's Hundred, Wolstenholme Towne = Initially, the English of the Virginia Company of London chose Jamestown for their first settlement of the Virginia Colony. They arrived in 1607 in a fleet of three ships commanded by Christopher Newport. (See main article Jamestown, Virginia) After five difficult years, the new colony gradually began expanding. Settlers established plantations along the James River, largely to grow non-native strains of tobacco. This was introduced and successfully exported in 1612 by colonist John Rolfe, who later married Pocahontas, daughter of the Powhatan. About downstream from Jamestown on the north bank of the river, just east of Grove Creek, the Grove area was originally settled by English colonists in 1618 as part of Martin's Hundred. The proprietary plantation of over 20,000 acres (80 km) was an enterprise of the Martin's Hundred Society, a London- based investment group operating under the auspices of the Virginia Company of London. Not far from the riverfront, the new Wolstenholme Towne, the Martin's Hundred administrative center, was established. Most of the population of Wolstenholme Towne was killed in the Indian Massacre of 1622, one of the largest incidents of loss of life by Virginia settlers during the colonial years. Colonists rebuilt the settlement a few years later, and protected it by a cross-peninsula palisade to the west completed in 1634. They abandoned Wolstenholme Towne around 1643 after Williamsburg was made the capital. The structures fell into ruin and the site became taken over by vegetation; it was lost until 1976 (see below). Martin's Hundred Parish Church was established by the Church of England, and served the area including Wolstenholme Towne. It was later combined with Yorkhampton Parish in adjacent York County. = Royal colony, creation of shires (counties) = James City County welcoming sign on U.S. Route 60 entering Grove from east at Skiffe's Creek. This border with the former Warwick County was established in 1634 by order of King Charles I of England (Warwick County became part of the City of Newport News in 1958) When the privately owned Virginia Company lost its charter in 1624, Virginia became a royal colony. In 1634, the English Crown created eight shires (i.e., counties) in the colony of Virginia, which then had a total population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. James City Shire, as well as the James River and Jamestown, took its name from King James I, the father of the then-king, Charles I. About 1642-43, the name of the James City Shire was changed to James City County. = Slavery, freedom = James City County received the first slaves whom the English imported to Virginia. Beginning in 1619, the English brought Africans to the colony as indentured servants. Increasingly toward the end of the 17th century, they hardened the labor system to create a racial caste of slavery for African workers and their families. Dutch and British ships transported large numbers of slaves from Africa to the Virginia Colony. On the labor-intensives tobacco plantations, planters replaced indentured laborers with slaves, who also served as household and skilled workers. In the later 17th and 18th centuries, economic conditions improved in England, so the supply of indentured laborers decreased. Early Africans became free after serving their period of indenture. Some individual slaves were freed as early as the mid-17th century by manumission. Some earned their freedom by separate labor, and others escaped. By far the greatest number of free African-American families in Virginia during colonial times were formed by marriage and unions between white working-class women and African men, whether indentured servant, slave or free. The children and their descendants were free because they had the status of the white mother, under the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, which Virginia had adopted into law in 1662. Known as free Negroes or free people of color, some of the people stayed in the area. Others migrated to urban or frontier areas away from the plantation areas where racial strictures were more severe. Richmond, which was an economic center, and Petersburg, which had industrial jobs, became early centers of free blacks in Virginia. There was mass emancipation of slaves during the years of the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Despite Virginia's secession from the Union in 1861, the US Army retained control of Fort Monroe at the eastern end of the Virginia Peninsula. It became a destination for slaves seeking freedom behind Union lines. By 1863, many heard President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation read under the Emancipation Oak. This tree is now within the grounds of Hampton University, a historically black college established soon after the war. After the War, many freedmen settled in inland areas of the Peninsula, either as landowners, tenant farmers, or renters who worked as watermen. While the southern side of the peninsula along the James River had long been occupied by large plantations, the northern side along the York River, west of Yorktown, had not been as heavily developed. Many freedmen moved into this area, establishing close-knit communities in mixed towns, as well as majority-black towns such as Lackey and Magruder.Bradley M. McDonald, Kenneth E. Stuck, Kathleen J. Bragdon. 'Cast Down Your Bucket Where You Are': An Ethnohistorical Study of the African-American Community on the Lands of the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station, 1865-1918, [Williamsburg, Va.: William and Mary College], The Center, [1992], full text online at HathiTrust, accessed 12 January 2015 = Carter's Grove = Carter's Grove Mansion More than 100 years after Wolstenholme Towne was abandoned, Carter's Grove Plantation was built on part of the Martin's Hundred land for Carter Burwell. He was the son of Elizabeth Carter Burwell and her husband Nathaniel Burwell. Carter Burwell was the grandson of the wealthy planter Robert \\"King\\" Carter (of Lancaster County). He bequeathed the land before his death, requiring that it be called Carter's Grove. The new plantation house was completed in 1755. In its long occupancy since then, the Carter's Grove mansion was renovated by a series of owners, the last major changes being of the late 1920s era. The last private owner died around 1964. The plantation moved into philanthropic ownership. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation (CW) owned the plantation from 1969 until 2007. It furnished the mansion in many period pieces, primarily of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of these were antiques acquired in the 1920s from an auction at Westover Plantation, long the home of descendants of William Byrd III. A landmark in the Grove Community, Carter's Grove Plantation was opened to the public by the CW Foundation for tours and interpretation of the mansion and reconstructed slave quarters. Public access was ended in 2003. In 1976 the Foundation conducted an archeological survey of the grounds. Near the river, the survey team rediscovered the long-lost site of Wolstenholme Towne. Noted archaeologist Ivor Noel Hume documented the archaeological dig that explored the site. The Foundation reconstructed part of Wolstenholme Towne and added it to the public tours and interpretation of the large plantation. In 2003, CW Foundation decided to concentrate on attractions closer to its Historic Area near downtown Williamsburg. It closed public access to Carter's Grove Plantation, which reduced tourist interest and revenue for the Grove community. Closer to the Historic Area, the CW Foundation developed another interpretive site for the African-American colonial experience in Virginia. CW sold Carter's Grove to private owners in 2007, with certain protective covenants to help preserve the nature of the site. Carter's Grove Country Road formerly offered a one-way, narrow, paved link to the Historic Area of Colonial Williamsburg. After it was damaged during Hurricane Isabel in late 2003, it was closed permanently to traffic. The primary access to the plantation on U.S. Route 60 was reopened shortly after the storm. The property has been closed to the public since 2003. = Location, early nature of Grove community = The Grove Community is located about a mile inland and parallel to the riverfront adjacent to the large Carter's Grove plantation. It was formed by freedmen after the Civil War and named after nearby Grove Creek, which drains into the James River about east (downstream) of Jamestown. Grove Wharf at the confluence of Grove Creek and the river is shown on some early maps of Virginia. Many freedman likely continued at the plantation as tenant farmers and workers after the war. Until 1918, the Grove Community was lightly populated. Its residents worked mostly as farmers and fishermen. According to a state atlas in 1895, Grove had a population of 37 persons and its own post office. Today it reaches approximately along U.S. Route 60, known locally as the Pocahontas Trail. = Grove Station on the new C&O; Railroad = Nearby Grove Station was established by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) under the leadership of Collis P. Huntington. In 1881 the C&O;'s Peninsula Extension was built through the area from its previous eastern terminus in Richmond to reach the coal piers and the new city of Newport News at the southeastern tip of Warwick County. Although a number of local railroad stations were established along the route, the primary purpose of the railroad was to transport through-coal traffic. This traffic pattern has continued into the 21st century under C&O; successor CSX Transportation. Local stations were established in James City County along the new railroad at Diascund, Toano, Vaiden's Siding (Norge), Kelton (Lightfoot) Ewell, Williamsburg, and Grove. While by 2009, Grove Station was long gone, other former C&O; railroad stations to the east at Lee Hall and to the west at Williamsburg were extant. The latter serves intercity passenger rail service of Amtrak. The former C&O; station from Ewell also survives in an adaptive reuse. Further west, a historic C&O; station built in 1908 for Norge has been preserved. It was relocated in 2006 to the site of the Croaker Branch of the Williamsburg Regional Library. Following historical research, the Norge Station was repainted in its original livery, featuring a bright orange as the primary color.\\"Norge Station repainted in original colors\\", Virginia Gazette, Jan 2009  20th century to present In the first half of the 20th century, Grove had two rapid periods of growth associated with military expansion during the World Wars. It received African-American residents displaced by government land acquisition for two large military reservations established by the U.S. Navy in adjacent York County. With their compensation, the new residents built new homes in the community, with contemporary amenities including electricity, running water and sidewalks. Grove includes residential areas, churches, neighborhood retail businesses, a nursing home, day care facilities, a modern community center and a magnet school of the Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools (WJC). = Relocations from \\"the Reservation\\"/Lackey = Prior to World War I, many African Americans lived just west of the current unincorporated town of Lackey in York County, where they (and their ancestors) had purchased land as freedmen or rented under sharecropping arrangements and established homesteads, particularly after the American Civil War. This close-knit community, along the old Yorktown-Williamsburg Road, was sometimes informally called \\"the Reservation,\\" was called Lackey. It had been rapidly settled by freedmen after the Civil War, as they wanted to establish homes and institutions free of white supervision. As the United States became involved in World War I in 1917, the U.S. Navy determined to establish a supply and munitions base near Yorktown adjacent to the York River. Under Executive Order of President Woodrow Wilson, the US Navy took a sizable piece of land to create the needed military base, initially known as a mine depot. Many homes were taken, and three churches were displaced. Some 600 residents, mostly African Americans who worked as farmers and fishermen, were displace and moved to other portions of York County and nearby Williamsburg. A few crossed the York River and settled in Gloucester County. The largest portion chose nearby James City County, where a substantial number relocated to Grove, which was south of the Navy land. Notable among the area's black population was John Tack Roberts. Born into slavery in approximately 1860, he was a farmer and self-taught man. He \\"read the law\\" with an established firm (a common practice for whites as well in that era) and became a magistrate. He was often called \\"Judge Roberts\\". Historians credit him with being instrumental in the growth of the Grove Community. He helped some of the families displaced from \\"the Reservation\\" to obtain financial compensation from the federal government. The Grove area is now part of what is called the Roberts Magisterial District of James City County, perhaps in honor of Judge Roberts or other members of his family. \\"John Tack Roberts\\" , James City County = Camp Wallace = As the United States became a participant in World War I, Camp Abraham Eustis was established in 1918 in neighboring Warwick County. It encompassed Mulberry Island and some adjacent mainland. A few miles upstream, also along the James River, a satellite facility, Camp Wallace, was established in 1918 as the Upper Firing Range for artillery training. Camp Wallace was the first site of the Army's aerial tramway. In 1923 the Camp became Fort Eustis. During World War II, when Virginia still had racial segregation laws, many black and other minority U.S. Army personnel stationed at Fort Eustis were restricted to living in separate housing in the Grove Community. In 1971, the U.S. Army agreed to a land swap with Anheuser-Busch in return for a larger parcel located directly across Skiffe's Creek from Fort Eustis (adjacent to the southeastern edge of the Greenmount Industrial Park). Along with land sold by Colonial Williamsburg, the former Camp Wallace land became part of a massive private development.Kingsmill Resort in Williamsburg Virginia (VA) Nearby, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park opened in 1975, as well as a large brewery, and the Kingsmill Resort. = Highways = With the coming of the automobile as a common form of travel in the early 20th century, state and national attention was directed to improving roads. Because Grove was unincorporated and had a relatively small minority population at a time when blacks had been disenfranchised by the turn of the century Virginia constitution and discriminatory practices in voter registration, they had no say over routing of new highways. In the 1920s the new U.S. Route 60 was routed through the community from Williamsburg, displacing some homeowners and businesses. The construction was part of the Good Roads Movement. It bridged Skiffe's Creek into Warwick County to Lee Hall. The state chose this routing rather than a competing route via Halstead's Point in York County (now within the US Naval Weapons Station Yorktown). Earlier, the east-west road which became U.S. 60 was State Route 9. SR 9 was renumbered as State Route 39 in 1923. It became U.S. 60 in the mid-1920s when the highway was routed through Grove. Warwick County treasurer and civic leader Simon Curtis held a ceremony at the Lee Hall Depot in 1924 to celebrate the completion of first hard- surfaced roadway (concrete) between Newport News and Williamsburg. Two-lane U.S. 60 continues to form the main thoroughfare through the largely residential and neighborhood business section of Grove. It parallels the four- lane State Route 143 and Interstate 64. = Relocations from Magruder = During World War II, the US Navy acquired the property of another small town Magruder, located about north of Williamsburg in York County, and hundreds of acres of surrounding land to establish a U.S. Navy base for Seabee training. The base was initially called Camp Allen, and was later named Camp Peary. Like Grove, Lackey, and other small post-Civil War communities in northern York County, Magruder's residents were mostly African American. There were a mix of landowners and tenants. The property acquisition meant that the government also purchased land from businesses and a church. Residents migrated from Magruder mostly to Grove. One congregation relocated Mt. Gilead Baptist Church from Magruder to Grove, where they built a new structure along U.S. 60 in 1943. The church maintains cemeteries at its new and former locations. Although access to the base at Camp Peary is highly restricted, families and others from the church may gain permission to enter to visit and tend to the old cemetery. Magruder Avenue in Grove was likely named after the many new residents from the former town of Magruder during World War II. A small but historic section of the northwestern edge of Grove is physically located in York County. It is listed on that county's Historical Resources Survey (as are the former sites of the \\"lost towns\\" of Lackey and Magruder).  Modern times  The Grove community consists of about 1,100 families, who support a scattering of schools, churches, and retail businesses. It is located on a rural postal delivery route and carries the mailing address of Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. That historic city is located about to the west. Between Williamsburg and Grove are Anheuser-Busch industries and developments, including the company's Williamsburg brewery, Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park, an office park, and the Kingsmill resort and planned community. Grove has attracted industrial development related to regional businesses. = Residential = Grove is largely a bedroom community. Housing in Grove is generally considered more affordable than in many other areas of the fast- growing James City County. Many families have lived there for generations. Housing consists of older detached single-family homes situated on lots, with many dating to the two world war periods of rapid growth, and a number of newer houses. The latter are both interspersed in older neighborhoods and concentrated in newer subdivisions. Several large condominium projects and mobile home parks provide other choices. Two larger mobile home developments feature modern amenities, such as underground wiring, curbs and gutters, paved driveways, street lighting, and community playgrounds. As of 2007, residential development continued with a new townhouse project, and many new detached single family homes. While the mobile home parks are not expanding, in some instances owners are replacing units with new or much newer mobile homes on the existing lots. Throughout Grove, there are few vacant lots for additional mobile homes. = Community facilities = James River Elementary School and Abram Frink Community Center are co-located in a modern complex. The school is a magnet school of the Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools (WJC) which offers the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme, one of only five such schools in Virginia. There are five churches, two nursing homes, two day-care centers, and a fire station. The Grove Christian Outreach Center (GCOC) is an agency affiliated with Grove Community Church. Staffed by volunteers, GCOC assists with family needs and coordination of community resources, such as the local food bank. = Retail = Grove includes a small retail strip at its eastern end, the Windy Hill Shops, a convenience store with gasoline. A free-standing 7-11 store and a campground are on the north side of U.S. Route 60. = Industrial = Near Grove's eastern edge, on the south side of U.S. Route 60, the county's James River Enterprise Zone, an Urban Enterprise Zone is located. The 5.6 square mile (15 km) area contains 2,400 acres (9.7 km) planned and zoned for industrial uses. James City County is seeking additional industrial business in this prime area of the county. The sites within a designated \\"enterprise zone\\" offer state and local incentives to businesses that locate in those zones, invest and create jobs. Since the James River Enterprise Zone's inception in 1996, James River Commerce Center and Greenmount industrial parks have added tenants such as a Ball Manufacturing plant, an aluminum can plant which supplies Anheuser- Busch's Williamsburg brewery. A distribution center for Wal-Mart and a Haynes furniture warehouse are also located there. Recently, a masonry supply firm and a Volvo equipment rental facility have each announced plans to establish facilities. Carter Machinery Company, a Caterpillar dealership with 17 locations in Virginia and West Virginia, announced in May 2007 that it is building a new sales and service center on a site. Additional sites are available for development.Article , Virginia Gazette, 12 May 2007 = U.S. Route 60 relocation project = For several years in the early 21st century, James City County has worked to improve US Route 60 between Grove and Newport News. Officials wanted to provide better access to Interstate 64 from the industrial sites in Grove, which generate a considerable volume of truck traffic, and reduce the same on the existing roadway. Access for the industrial traffic to I-64 requires a drive of about in either direction on two-lane sections of U.S. 60 at non-highway speeds through residential areas. They must share the road with local traffic and school buses serving either the James River Elementary School's county-wide magnet program or alternatively, the large elementary school in the Lee Hall community in neighboring Newport News. In June 2007, Virginia's Commonwealth Transportation Board approved a major portion of the funding needed for the U.S. Route 60 relocation project. The relocated divided highway will begin on its western end near the current intersection of Blow Flats Road. The new alignment will take it through the Greenmount Industrial Park to reach the Newport News city limits. There, a new crossing of Skiffe's Creek will be built. The remainder of the roadway will continue on a new alignment and effectively bypass the two-lane portion of U.S. Route 60 through the historic Lee Hall community. It will rejoin the current highway near the cloverleaf intersection of Fort Eustis Boulevard, where there is four-lane access close by to exit 250 of Interstate 64, as well as an extant four-lane section of U.S. Route 60. In separate projects, portions of Warwick Boulevard east of Fort Eustis in Newport News are being widened to six lanes. Fort Eustis Boulevard has also been widened to four lanes between Jefferson Avenue and U.S. Route 17 in Newport News and York County. A similar roads issue was earlier visited in the 1930s, when the current parallel State Route 143 (Merrimack Trail) was built as part of a four-laned through-route alternative to U.S. 60 for increasing volumes of east-west through traffic in the area. Once again, plans have been made to preserve the two-lane, bucolic nature of Route 60 through the Grove and Lee Hall communities, and to avoid the major impact which would have resulted by widening the road through these historic communities. = Public transportation = There is little retail or tourist employment in Grove, especially since Carter's Grove Plantation closed in 2003. Many residents use the Williamsburg Area Transit Authority (WATA) public bus system or its complementary paratransit service to reach employment, shopping, and other business at adjacent Busch Gardens Williamsburg, in downtown Williamsburg, and at businesses along the way, or to transfer to other routes in the WATA network through the system's hub at the Williamsburg Transportation Center. Amtrak, Greyhound Lines, and Trailways services, as well as taxicabs and rental cars, are also located in Williamsburg. The WATA bus route serving Grove leaves the Williamsburg Transportation Center on the hour (and half hour during peak weekday hours) and runs along U.S. Route 60 through the entire length of Grove. It continues east to serve the Wal-Mart distribution center, a Haynes furniture warehouse in the growing Green Mount industrial park, and provides an hourly connection seven days a week to the massive Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) system at the western edge of Newport News at Lee Hall. The WATA bus stops on a side street adjacent to an industrial park, returning to Williamsburg via Grove with departures on the half-hour (and hour during peak weekday hours). The HRT system covers most of the other cities of Hampton Roads, with extensive networks in highly urbanized areas of Newport News, Hampton, and Norfolk. Some heavily patronized HRT routes trace their heritage to street railway lines started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Notable residents and sites  * Dr. J.

The grandmother forces Er√©ndira to repay the debt by becoming a prostitute as they travel the road as vagrants. Men line up to enjoy Er√©ndira's services and eventually, after several years, Ulises, one of her clients, falls in love with her. She returns his affection and he eventually becomes willing to help her to freedom; he formulates a plan to escape with her and live off a fortune from oranges which contain diamonds smuggled by his Dutch father. The only obstacle lies in her grandmother, whom Er√©ndira convinces Ulises to kill. Not being the homicidal type, he attempts poisoning and an explosive, but must eventually resort to stabbing her while she sleeps.

It consists of two pentagons joined to each other by a ring of 10 triangles for a total of 12 faces. Hence, it is a non-regular dodecahedron.  Geometry  If the faces of the pentagonal antiprism are all regular, it is a semiregular polyhedron. It can also be considered as a parabidiminished icosahedron, a shape formed by removing two pentagonal pyramids from a regular icosahedron leaving two nonadjacent pentagonal faces; a related shape, the metabidiminished icosahedron (one of the Johnson solids), is likewise form from the icosahedron by removing two pyramids, but its pentagonal faces are adjacent to each other. The two pentagonal faces of either shape can be augmented with pyramids to form the icosahedron. = Relation to polytopes = The pentagonal antiprism occurs as a constituent element in some higher-dimensional polytopes. Two rings of 10 pentagonal antiprisms each bound the hypersurface of the 4-dimensional grand antiprism. If these antiprisms are augmented with pentagonal prism pyramids and linked with rings of 5 tetrahedra each, the 600-cell is obtained.

Larsen from Time, Inc., the monthly theatrically shown newsreels The March of Time. His brother, Richard, was also a producer and writer on The March of Time. The de Rochemonts were descended from Huguenot ancestors who settled in New Hampshire early in the nineteenth century. Born in 1899, the son of a Boston attorney, he grew up in small-town Massachusetts. His film career began when, still a teenager, he filmed his New England neighbours and sold the footage to local theatres under the title See Yourself as Others See You.Orwell Subverted, Daniel Leab, Penn State Press, pp. 21-22 The newsreels he created defined film news from 1935‚Äì51. The 20-minute films, which combined filmed news with interpretive interviews and dramatizations, appeared between featured films in theaters. When he moved from newsreels to feature films, de Rochemont chose to produce films based on real stories in actual locations, often with locals in the cast. After three spy films that helped define film noir, including The House on 92nd Street (1945), he produced a wide array of feature films such as the semi-documentary Boomerang (1947). He has been called the \\"father of the docu- drama.\\" His early documentary productions won 2 Academy Awards.

Mechanism Its primary action is vasodilation due to Œ±1 blockade. Non-selective Œ±-blockers can cause a much more pronounced reflex tachycardia than the selective Œ±1 blockers. Like the selective Œ±1 blockers, phentolamine causes a relaxation of systemic vasculature, leading to hypotension. This hypotension is sensed by the baroreceptor reflex, which results in increased sympathetic nerve firing on the heart, releasing norepinephrine. In response, the Œ≤1 adrenergic receptors on the heart increase their rate, contractility, and dromotropy, which help to offset the decrease in systemic blood pressure. Unlike the Œ±1 selective blockers, phentolamine also inhibits the Œ±2 receptors, which function predominantly as presynaptic negative feedback for norepinephrine release. By abolishing this negative feedback phentolamine leads to even less regulated norepinephrine release, which results in a more drastic increase in heart rate. Uses The primary application for phentolamine is for the control of hypertensive emergencies, most notably due to pheochromocytoma. It also has usefulness in the treatment of cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications, where one would generally avoid Œ≤-blockers (e.g. metoprolol), as they can cause unopposed Œ±-adrenergic mediated coronary vasoconstriction, worsening myocardial ischemia and hypertension. It is important to note that phentolamine is not a first-line agent for this indication. Phentolamine should only be given to patients who do not fully respond to benzodiazepines, nitroglycerin, and calcium channel blockers. When given by injection it causes blood vessels to dilate, thereby increasing blood flow. When injected into the penis (intracavernosal), it increases blood flow to the penis, which results in an erection. It may be stored in crash carts to counteract severe peripheral vasoconstriction secondary to extravasation of peripherally placed vasopressor infusions, typically of norepinephrine. Epinephrine infusions are less vasoconstrictive than norepinephrine as they primarily stimulate Œ≤ receptor more than Œ± receptors, but the effect remains dose-dependent. Phentolamine also has diagnostic and therapeutic roles in complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy). Phentolamine is marketed in the dental field as a local anesthetic reversal agent. Branded as OraVerse, it is a phentolamine mesylate injection designed to reverse the local vasoconstrictor properties used in many local anesthetics to prolong anesthesia.

The Ancient Church of the East distinguished itself from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1964. It is one of the Assyrian Churches that claim continuity with the historical Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon ‚Äì the Church of the East, one of the oldest Christian Churches in Mesopotamia. The Church is headquartered in Baghdad, Iraq. In 1970, Catholicos-Patriarch Mar Addai II succeeded Mar Thoma Darmo (1968‚Äì1969). History The Ancient Church of the East emerged as the result of a schism within the Assyrian Church of the East, in opposition to reforms introduced by Patriarch Mar Shimun XXI Eshai of the Assyrian Church of the East, including the substitution of the modern Gregorian Calendar in place of the traditional Julian Calendar (which differs from the Gregorian by a widening number of days, currently thirteen). The Ancient Church of the East seated itself in Baghdad, Iraq, headed by a separate Catholicos-Patriarch. Following the schism, the position of Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East remained vacant from 1964 until 1968, when Mar Thoma Darmo was named the church's patriarch. Mar Thoma was elected as a rival Catholicos- Patriarch to Mar Eshai Shimun, who continued to serve as the official head of the Assyrian Church of the East headquartered in the United States. The elected Catholicos-Patriarch Mar Thoma was a native of Mesopotamia (present- day Iraq), and a former Metropolitan of the Assyrian Church of the East based in Thrissur, India. Mar Thoma served as Metropolitan from 1952 until his resignation in 1964. Upon becoming the head of Ancient Church of the East, he immediately relocated to Baghdad. = Under the tenure of Mar Thoma Darmo = In September 1968, Mar Addai Giwargis was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan of Iraq. Similarly, Mar Aprem Mooken was consecrated Metropolitan of India, and Mar Poulose Poulose was consecrated Bishop of India. These prelates in turn consecrated Mar Thoma Darmo Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East during the first week of October 1968. Mar Thoma Darmo then became the Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East. Mar Thoma served as Patriarch for just under a year before his death in September 1969. = Under the tenure of Mar Addai II = Following Patriarch Mar Thoma Darmo's death in 1969, Mar Addai II assumed the position of acting patriarch, and was later elected to lead the Ancient Church of the East in February 1970. In the meantime, he consecrated two Metropolitans, both in December 1969: Mar Narsai Toma was consecrated as Metropolitan of Kirkuk, and Mar Toma Eramia was consecrated Metropolitan of Nineveh (Mosul) and Northern Iraq. Mar Addai's official jurisdiction at the time was Baghdad. Together, on February 20, 1972, Mar Narsai and Mar Toma consecrated Mar Addai Giwargis as Catholicos-Patriarch.  Expansion of the Holy Synod  In 1985, Mar Daniel Yakob, Bishop of Kirkuk of the Assyrian Church of the East was accepted into the Holy Synod of the Ancient Church of the East. He was to head the parishes in California, but ultimately served as an Auxiliary Bishop. In July 1992, Mar Yacoub Daniel was consecrated Bishop of Syria. The following year, in June 1993, Mar Emmanuel Elia was ordained Bishop of the Patriarchate of Baghdad. In 1994, however, Mar Emmanuel shifted his residence and became Bishop of North America and Canada. In November and December 1995, the Ancient Church experienced several major changes. Mar Aprem Mooken and Mar Poulose Poulose, along with the Church of India, reunited with the Assyrian Church of the East for external reasons. During that same period, Timothaus Mar Shallita (Mar Shallita) was accepted into the Holy Synod and appointed Metropolitan of Europe, and Mar Yacoub Daniel was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan. In July 2005, Mar Yacoub was transferred from Syria to Australia and New Zealand. In April 2009, Mar Addai II consecrated Mar Zaia Khoshaba as Bishop of Baghdad. In the same month, he ordained Mar Aprem Daweed as Bishop of Duhok. In 2011, Mar Aprem resigned after serving just two years. 2011 also saw the resignation of Mar Emmanuel. In August 2011, Mar Yacoub Daniel and Mar Zaia Khoshaba consecrated Mar Mari Emmanuel as Bishop for Australia and New Zealand, assisting the Metropolitan. Later Mar Addai II consecrated Mar Gewargis Younan as Bishop of Chicago, the youngest-serving prelate of the Ancient Church of the East. In 2015, while the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East was vacant following the death of Dinkha IV, the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch Louis Rapha√´l I Sako proposed a \\"merger\\" or reunion of his own Chaldean Catholic Church with both the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East to (re-)create one united \\"Church of the East\\" with a single patriarch in full communion with the Pope.\\"Chaldean Patriarch gambles on re-establishing 'Church of the East'‚Äù La Stampa 25 June 2015. Accessed 11 May 2017. The proposal did not go forward, and the Assyrian Church of the East elected a new patriarch of its own.  Organisation  The Ancient Church of the East recognizes the following nine positions in its hierarchy: #Patriarch #Metropolitan (Archbishop) #Bishop #Archdeacon #Chorbishop #Priest #Deacon #Subdeacon #Reader The Patriarch is the supreme head of the church, and oversees all dioceses of the church. The church has an episcopal polity, meaning it is organized into dioceses, each headed by a bishop. Dioceses are organized into Ecclesiastical provinces under the authority of a Metropolitan. Each diocese is made up of several parish communities. The individual parishes are staffed by at least one priest. Priests are assisted by Deacons, Subdeacons, and Readers. All members of the clergy may preach, baptize, witness marriages, and conduct funeral liturgies, though Deacons, Subdeacons, and Readers assume an assistant's role. Only those ranking above a deacon can celebrate the sacraments of the Eucharist, though others may be ministers of Holy Communion. Administering the sacrament of holy orders (ordaining someone into the clergy) is limited to bishops, metropolitans, and the Patriarch. = Holy Synod = * Mar Addai II, Catholicos-Patriarch of the East (seat in Baghdad) * Mar Yacoub Daniel, Metropolitan of Australia and New Zealand (seat in Sydney, Australia) * Mar Zaia Khoshaba, Metropolitan of North America and Europe (seat in Hamilton, Canada) * Mar Gewargis Younan, Bishop of Chicago (seat in Chicago, USA) Since January 2011 the synod of the Ancient Church of the East has split between those accepting the Patriarchate of Mar Addai II and those Old Calendarists rejecting it. The anti-patriarchal party is headed by Timothaus Mar Shallita. Individual parishes in Sweden, Denmark, United States and Australia adhere to these prelates: * Mar Timothaus Shallita, Metropolitan (Mainz, Germany) * Mar Toma Erimia Giwargis, Metropolitan (Hamilton, Canada) * Mar Daniel Yakob, Bishop (Modesto, USA) * Mar Mari Emmanuel, Bishop (Sydney, Australia) = International dioceses = * Patriarchal Archdiocese of Baghdad and Basra * Archdiocese of Kirkuk * Archdiocese of Nineveh (Mosul) and Northern Iraq * Archdiocese of Syria * Diocese of Europe * Diocese of Australia and New Zealand * Archdiocese of North America * Diocese of California * Diocese of Chicago  List of Catholicos-Patriarchs of the Ancient Church of the East  =Prior to 1964= In 1964, during the reign of Shemon XXI Eshai (also known as Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII), a schism occurred in the Church of the East causing the establishment of a separate Ancient Church of the East with its center in Baghdad. The Ancient Church of the East acknowledges the traditional lineage of the Patriarchs of the Church of the East in Babylon from Mar Shimun Keepa (Saint Peter)1 Peter 5:13 until the schism of 1964. The Ancient Church considers itself a true continuation of this lineage, and recognizes the Assyrian Church of the East as the same. This schism occurred because of the changing of the church calendar from the traditional Julian calendar to the Gregorian one, along with hereditary succession and tribal rivalry. Directly following the split from the Assyrian Church of the East, the seat of the Patriarch remained vacant for three years before a Patriarch was elected. In 1968 communities in Iraq, Syria and India elected a rival Patriarch centered in Baghdad, the then suspended Metropolitan of India Mar Thoma Darmo. Mar Thoma Darmo consecrated prelates who in turn consecrated him Catholicos- Patriarch. Currently the Patriarchate is located in Baghdad, Iraq. = Since 1964 = # Vacant (1964 to 1967) ‚Äì first period of the schism # Mar Thoma Darmo (1968 to 1969) # Vacant ‚Äì Locum Tenens: Mar Addai II as Acting Patriarch (1969 to 1972) # Mar Addai II (1972 to present day) Church of the East Old Calendarists Various communities of Church of the East Old Calendarists seceded from the Ancient Church of the East in 2011 by continuing to observe the 25th of December on January 6th and 25th of March on April 6th, the Church of the East Calendar being 12 days behind the Gregorian calendar. Relationship with the Assyrian Church of the East The Ancient Church of the East was distinguished by its intent to maintain the traditions passed on by the Church of the East. The schism that divided the Church of the East into two parts resulted mainly from controversial changes introduced by Mar Shimun XXI Eshai. The most obvious of these was the decision to replace the traditional Julian Calendar with the Gregorian Calendar. Additionally, there were concerns raised in regard to the succession of the Patriarchate. The Patriarchate had been hereditary in the Mar Shimun family for six centuries, often resulting in the consecration of minors as head of the church. For example, the late Shimun XXI Eshai himself was ordained Patriarch at just twelve years old.Biography of His Holiness, The Assyrian Martyr, The Late Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII Under the tenure of Mar Addai II, the Ancient Church of the East has made several gestures towards reunification with the Assyrian Church of the East. The most prominent of these is undoubtedly the declaration made in June 2010 stating that the Ancient Church of the East would now celebrate Christmas on December 25, in accordance with the Gregorian Calendar. Previously, the church recognized the Julian date (currently corresponding to January 7 on the Gregorian Calendar) each year as Christmas Day, as the Church of the East had for thousands of years. The decision was to be implemented later that year, on December 25, 2010.The Assyrian: Ancient Church of the East moves to change calendar This was the first time since the schism that the two churches celebrated the Christmas holiday on the same day. Despite this decision, many Church of the East Old Calendarists rejected the move so in an attempt to avert further dissent, the Holy Synod maintained that Easter would continue to be celebrated according to the Julian Calendar. The declaration related to the celebration of Christmas was perceived as an attempt of reconciliation, and encouraged efforts for talks of reunification. A joint Holy Synod between the two churches was postponed, though is expected in the near future. The international Assyrian community has long-since advocated for reunification, particularly in response to the 2014 and 2015 attacks launched against Assyrians in Iraq and Syria, respectively. Since that time, relations between the churches have improved on every level, particularly in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe. = Dialogue for reunification = In early May 2015, following the death of Mar Dinkha IV, Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, dialogue of unification resumed between the churches. Reunification of the two branches of the Church of the East was encouraged by the Patriarch. Following an informal meeting between Mar Gewargis Younan and Mar Paulus Benjamin, an official meeting request was delivered to Mar Aprem Mooken, acting Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. On May 22, 2015, a meeting involving prelates of both Holy Councils took place in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the library of St. Andrew's Assyrian Church of the East. Present were Mar Yacoub Daniel, Mar Zaia Khoshaba, and Mar Gewargis Younan representing the Ancient Church of the East, and Mar Gewargis Sliwa, Mar Awa Royel, and Mar Iskhaq Yousif representing the Assyrian Church of the East. Archdeacon William Toma served as the meeting's common secretary. Mar Yacoub Daniel flew in from Australia for the meeting, and Mar Zaia traveled from Canada. During the meeting, recommendations for unity between the Ancient Church of the East and Assyrian Church of the East were delivered through the selected representatives of each branch. The primary issues discussed were church leadership and the Holy Calendar. It was decided in this meeting that the individual Synods would meet separately to further discuss the terms. Another meeting between the two churches would then be scheduled to continue negotiations. It was requested by the Ancient Church of the East prelates that the election of the new Catholicos-Patriarch be delayed until negotiations had been concluded, in the hopes that a unified Synod would elect a successor together. In the event that the churches agree to reunify, Mar Addai II would be expected to resign. The Patriarch has already given his blessings, provided that the celebration of Easter Sunday in accordance with the traditional Julian Calendar is maintained. On June 1, 2015, the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East met in Erbil, Iraq, to discuss the future of the church. The date had previously been arranged for the election of the new Catholicos-Patriarch. Mar Awa Royel issued a statement on the same day, notifying the public that a response to the Ancient Church of the East's recommendations for reunification had been delivered to their prelates. The letter requested a prompt response to the terms, and the election of the new Patriarch was suspended until the following week, on June 8, 2015. On June 2, 2015, Mar Gewargis Younan issued a statement on behalf of the Ancient Church of the East stating that a provisional decision had been reached to reunify the two branches. The statement dated June 2, 2015, also indicated that the Holy Synod of the Ancient Church planned to convene in the near future to issue a formal response. On June 5, 2015, Mar Aprem Mooken issued a formal statement announcing that the election of the next Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East was suspended until September 27, 2015, pending the unification of the churches.

Raymond, an original forty-niner, bought or built a stagecoach station here, at the junction of the Walker Pass road (the route of modern California 178) and the road to Los Angeles (now replaced by California State Route 14). Both roads carried traffic to and from the mines then in the area. The Walker Pass road led to the Kern River mines, while the Los Angeles road continued further north and east to the mines at Cerro Gordo, the Panamints, and later Darwin and Bodie, California. On February 25, 1874, Tiburcio Vasquez and his associates robbed several freight wagon crews at Raymond's station (then called Coyote Holes). They had apparently scouted the location from a nearby rock formation, now known as Robber's Roost. Vasquez's group also ambushed and robbed an arriving stagecoach before making their escape. One of the robbery victims was shot in the leg. Raymond continued operating the stagecoach stop, which after 1889 or 1890 included a post office, until his death in August, 1909. The station burned down a few years later. The Los Angeles Aqueduct now passes through the site.

He played for the Western Suburbs Magpies and for the Wests Tigers in two separate spells in the NRL. Skandalis also played for the Huddersfield Giants in the Super League and City Origin between 2002 and 2006. Background Skandalis was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The Skandalis family home in Lightning Ridge burnt down when John was six, causing the family to move to Ashfield, and later Minto. Skandalis' mother died when he was in his teens, leaving his father to raise Skandalis and his sisters. He was \\"taken in\\" by Josie McGuinness, the mother of Kevin and Ken McGuinness, who, he says, \\"treated him like [a] son.\\" Playing career Skandalis was the last original Western Suburbs player remaining at the Wests Tigers club after the merger in 2000. He signed on for the Magpies in the early 1990s after playing out his junior years with the Minto Cobras, and attending Sarah Redfern High School. His first grade d√©but came in round 9 of the 1996 season against the Penrith Panthers on 17 May. He made 10 appearances that season, including the Magpies last ever finals appearance against Cronulla on 6 September. A regular in the starting team in 1997, Skandalis scored 3 tries from his 20 appearances. He scored his first in the 24 May match against the Gold Coast Titans, as they won 26-10. With the decline of the Magpies, Skandalis played in 34 games in the next 2 seasons, with only 5 being victories. He scored the first try for the Wests Tigers in 2000. Skandalis was known for his workhorse attitude and his never say die approach to rugby league and as the years progressed his performances gradually caught the attention of representative selectors. This was seen in both the 2002 and 2004 seasons where Skandalis was dually awarded with his first representative call up for City team in the annual City v. Country fixture. Skandalis was named the Wests Tigers' player of the year in 2002. 200px Skandalis was a member of the Wests Tigers team which won the 2005 NRL Grand Final against the Cowboys. He was named in the Big League team of the year for the 2005 NRL season.Middleton, David (Editor); 2009 Official Rugby League Annual; published 2010 for the National Rugby League by News Magazines, Alexandria NSW, 2015 As NRL Premiers Wests faced Super League champions Bradford Bulls in the 2006 World Club Challenge. Skandalis played as a prop forward in the Tigers' 30-10 loss. Skandalis held the record for the most first grade games for the Wests Tigers with 185 appearances. In 2012 the record was surpassed by Chris Heighington, though Skandalis had previously played 64 games for Wests Magpies before the club merged. On 14 June 2006, Skandalis signed a two-year contract to play in the Super League with the Huddersfield Giants, starting from the 2007 season. In 2008, Skandalis was made vice-captain of the squad, alongside Ryan Hudson. He led the team out against Wigan when regular captain Chris Thorman was injured. Skandalis returned to Australia at the end of the 2008 season following a knee injury, picked up early in the season, which prevented him from participating further. Skandalis took up a post with Wests Tigers Youth Development.Giants' Skando to go http://www.examiner.co.uk/huddersfield-giants/huddersfield-giants- news/2008/07/24/giants-skando-to-go-86081-21395497 In 2009, Skandalis was named in the Wests Magpies NSW Cup side, but was recalled to the Wests Tigers team from round 11, after injuries to other players. He remained in the first grade team for the rest of the season. After the end of the 2009 season, Skandalis announced he would be retiring and taking up the position of strength and conditioning coach with the Wests Tigers NYC team. However, Skandalis returned to play for the Magpies in the middle of the 2010 season, and then, in July, made a shock comeback with the Tigers, coach Tim Sheens saying, \\"I can't get rid of the guy.\\" Playing another 5 games, he fell just short of making his 250th NRL appearance. He is the oldest player to have played at the club, being 34 years and 73 days old in his last appearance for the club. The inaugural \\"Philips Sports Dad of the Year\\" was awarded to Skandalis in late 2009, narrowly defeating Brett Kimmorley. He donated the money to the Starlight Children's Foundation. Skandalis has been made a life member of the Western Suburbs club. Skandalis' Greek heritage made him eligible to represent Greece, which he did as captain.http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=26728 He played for Greece in the 2009 Australian Mediterranean Shield. Greece won the final 34-14 against Italy. Post-playing career Having spent 2 years with the Wests Tigers' NYC team, in 2012 Skandalis became the club's head conditioner. He was removed from the position with the arrival of new coach Jason Taylor in 2014, but remained in the club in other roles. In 2017, he became an assistant to the Wests Magpies ISP coach, former teammate Brett Hodgson. Skandalis has been involved in the Macquarie Fields Finding Jobs, Changing Lives program, helping troubled youth from the Macquarie Fields area. He was made an NRL ambassador in 2017.

Located at 453 West 12th Avenue, the building was ordered by the Vancouver Civic Building Committee, designed by architect Fred Townley and Matheson, and built by Carter, Halls, Aldinger and Company. The building has a twelve-storey tower (the point being 323 feet/98 metres above sea level) with a clock on the top. The building is served by the Broadway‚ÄìCity Hall station on SkyTrain's Canada Line. History Between 1897 and 1929, the Vancouver City Hall was located on Main Street, just south of the Carnegie Library; that building had previously served as a public market and an auditorium. In 1929, City Hall moved into the Holden Building (built 1911), while the Main Street building became an extension of the Carnegie Library.The History of Metropolitan Vancouver - 1929 Chronology After being elected mayor in 1934, Gerry McGeer appointed a three-man committee to select the location for a new city hall; choices included the former Central School site at Victory Square, and Strathcona Park at the corner of Cambie Street and West 12th Avenue (no relation to the current park in the Strathcona neighbourhood). The panel recommended the Strathcona Park site, and City Council approved the selection in 1935, making Vancouver the first major Canadian city to locate its city hall outside its downtown. City Hall a month before opening Construction of the new City Hall began in 1936 (Vancouver's Golden Jubilee) on January 3, and the first cornerstone was laid by McGeer on July 2. An eight-foot statue of Capt. George Vancouver, carved by Charles Marega, was placed at the front of the building. It was unveiled on August 20 by the visiting Lord Mayor of London, Sir Percy Vincent. Sir Percy also presented several gifts to the city, including a civic mace, and a sprig \\"...from a tree in the orchard where a falling apple gave Isaac Newton the idea that led to his theory of gravity.\\" The mace and the statue still reside at city hall. The building was started and opened all in the same year. Construction cost $1 million, and was completed on December 1, bringing an end to the 330-day construction. Each lock plate on the outer doors displays the Vancouver Coat of Arms, and each door knob bears the monogram of the building. The ceiling on the second floor of the rotunda was made of gold leaf from several BC mines. After winning the civic election on December 9, 1936, George Clark Miller became the first mayor of Vancouver to occupy the brand-new city hall on January 2, 1937. A four- storey east wing was added in 1968The History of Metropolitan Vancouver - 1968 Chronology (completed in 1970) and in 2012 city staff gradually started moving out when a study found it would not withstand an earthquake.

The system uses an electronically-actuated clutch-pack differential to vary the torque between the front and rear axles. Models with the DPC torque vectoring system also have a planetary gearset to overdrive an axle or rear wheel as required. Prior to the introduction of xDrive, all-wheel drive was available on several models since 1985, based on an all-wheel drive system that uses viscous couplings.  Predecessor  The first BMWs available with all-wheel drive were the 1985-1992 E30 325iX and 1991-1996 E34 525iX models. These cars use centre and rear differentials with viscous couplings to vary the torque split between wheels. The centre differential has a default front:rear torque split of 37:63, due to the planetary gear. Up to 80% of the torque can be transferred to the tripping axle, using the increasing shear force of the silicone fluid in the viscous coupling (due to the slotted/grooved plates inside the unit) as wheel slip causes one axle to spin faster than the other. The same principle applies to the rear differential varying the torque split between the rear wheels. The front differential has no locking function. All-wheel drive was discontinued when the E30 3 Series and E34 5 Series were replaced by the E36 and E39 respectively. All-wheel drive was reintroduced in 2001 for the X5 SUV and E46 3 series 325xi, 330xi and 330xd sedans/wagons. The system is similar to the earlier version, except without the viscous couplings. Instead, the electronic stability control (DSC) system applies the brake to wheels that are slipping, helping transfer power to the wheels with traction.  Design  Unlike its predecessor, the xDrive system uses an electronically-actuated clutch-pack differential that engages to send torque to the front axle. In the case of the 2018 X3 through X6 models, the default torque split is 40:60 and the system is able to send 100% of the torque to either axle. However, full torque transfer to the front axle can only be achieved if the rear wheels have absolutely no traction, as the rear drive shaft is hard-coupled to the transmission output,. The wet clutch is applied through a high speed electric servo motor turning a cam-shaped actuator disc. In most vehicles, the system uses open differentials at the front and rear, relying on the brakes (controlled by the electronic stability control system) to transfer torque away from the slipping wheel on each axle. A different system is used on BMWs which are based on a transverse engine front-wheel drive platform, such as the BMW X1 (F48), BMW 1 Series (F40) and BMW 2 Series Active Tourer. These models use a Haldex system which sends 100% of the torque to the front wheels by default, only sending torque to the rear wheels when the front wheels are slipping. = Dynamic Performance Control = An upgraded version of xDrive with torque vectoring, called 'Dynamic Performance Control' (DPC), was introduced on the 2008 BMW X6 and has since become available on other vehicles including the BMW X5 M. As per most torque vectoring systems, the primary function is to increase agility in cornering. The DPC system is also used by the electronic stability control (DSC) to correct for understeer/oversteer, with one reviewer commenting that it provided smoother results and avoided the temporary power loss associated with the traditional method of using individual wheel brakes in such situations. The DPC system can distribute torque between the front and rear axles, and between the two wheels on the rear axle. The system uses a clutch pack and planetary gearset within the differential to overdrive a wheel or axle as required.  Applications  The first models xDrive models (as opposed to the earlier all-wheel drive system) were released in 2003. These consisted of the newly released BMW X3 (E83), facelifted BMW X5 (E53) and the facelifted BMW 3 Series (E46). In the following years, the availability of xDrive increased throughout the model range, and it is currently available on most models. The first BMW M models to use xDrive were the 2009 E70 X5M and E71 X6M models. The first non-SUV BMW M model to not be rear-wheel drive was the 2017 F90 M5, which was only available with xDrive. In Canada, 50 percent of BMWs sold in 2005 were fitted with xDrive. As of 2010, BMW Canada stopped offering rear-wheel drive versions of models that were available with xDrive, for example the only BMW 6 Series (F12) 650i version available without xDrive in 2012 was the convertible version.

In his Ph.D. thesis written under Frederic Fitch, Martin discovered virtual sets a bit before Quine, and was possibly the first non-Pole other than Joseph Henry Woodger to employ a mereological system. Building on these and other devices, Martin forged a first-order theory capable of expressing its own syntax as well as some semantics and pragmatics (via an event logic), all while abstaining from set and model theory (consistent with his nominalist principles), and from intensional notions such as modality.  Career  Martin was educated as follows: * B.A. Harvard, philosophy, 1941; * M.A. Columbia, 1941; * Ph.D. Yale, philosophy, 1952. Martin studied under Alfred North Whitehead, then in his last year at Harvard, and may have studied under Ernest Nagel at Columbia. During World War II, Martin taught mathematics at Princeton University, then at the University of Chicago. After the war, he taught philosophy at Bryn Mawr College 1946-48, the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) 1948-59, the University of Texas 1959-63, New York University 1963-73, Northwestern 1973-76 (full-time) and 1976-85 (one course per year). Martin also held visiting appointments at Bonn, Yale, Hamburg, the New School, and Temple. In 1976, Martin largely retired from teaching, becoming a research associate with Boston University‚Äôs Center for the History and Philosophy of Science. He made excellent use of the resulting leisure, so that his final decade of life was by far his most productive, publishing over 100 book chapters and journal articles. In 1979, he published the definitive treatment of his logic / first-order theory, Part A of Semiotics, and edited a volume of Carolyn Eisele‚Äôs writings on Charles Sanders Peirce. He helped edit the Festschrift books for Fitch and J. N. Findlay, respectively, published in 1975 and 1985. At the time of his death, Martin served on the editorial board of eight journals and on the advisory board of the Peirce Edition Project. In 1981, he became president of the Charles S. Peirce Society. In 1984, he was elected president of the Metaphysical Society of America. Despite having held tenure track appointments from 1948 until his death, the only Ph.D. thesis known to have been completed under Martin‚Äôs supervision is that of James Scoggin. Otherwise, Martin‚Äôs legacy is coextensive with his published writings.  Ideas  \\"‚Ä¶one of the most many-sided, prolific, and scholarly of analytic philosophers.\\" :--Hans Burkhardt, Foreword to Metaphysical. Martin was part of the first wave of American analytic philosophers; arguably, only Quine (1908-2000), Fitch (1909-1987), and Henry Leonard (1905-67) preceded him. His chronological elders Nelson Goodman (1906-1998) and Wilfrid Sellars (1912-89) were arguably his contemporaries, as they all began their careers in earnest at about the same time, namely right after World War II. Martin's formal treatment of syntax followed Alfred Tarski; of semantics, Rudolf Carnap. Martin was generally well-disposed towards Carnap's work, contributed a long paper to the Schilpp volume on Carnap, and was seen as a disciple. Paradoxically, Martin was a positivist and radical nominalist who also sympathized with process theology and orthodox Christianity. Between 1943 and 1992, Martin published 16 books and about 240 papers (of which 179 were included in his books) on an extraordinary range of subjects, including aesthetics, logic, the foundation of mathematics, metaphysics, syntax/semantics/pragmatics, the philosophy of science, phenomenology, process philosophy, theology, Frege, and Charles Sanders Peirce. Martin preached and practiced that philosophy should be done formally, by employing first-order logic, the theory of virtual sets and relations, and a multiplicity of predicates, all culminating in an event logic. Starting with the papers reprinted in his 1969 Belief, Martin argued that the Frege's Art des Gegebensein was crucial to his thinking. Just what this Art entailed remains to be elucidated. Martin was especially fond of applying his first-order theory to the analysis of ordinary language, a method he termed logico- linguistics. He often referenced the work of the linguists Zellig Harris (admiringly) and Henry Hiz (more critically); Martin, Harris, and Hiz all taught at Penn in the 1950s. Yet Martin was dismissive of the related theoretical work by Noam Chomsky and his MIT colleagues and students. Ironically, Martin appears to have been Chomsky's main teacher of logic; while a student at Penn, Chomsky took every course Martin taught. Quine's Word and Object cites Martin with approval, but Martin's wider impact has not been commensurate with the breadth and depth of his writings; the secondary literature on Martin consists of little more than reviews of his books.

It exits into neighbouring Moroiso inlet. History During historic times, the Aburatsubo inlet was selected by the feudal Miura family to build a series of fortifications, with Arai castle at its center. During the Sengoku period, the castle fell after a 3-year siege to the rival Later H≈çj≈ç clan, in the year 1516. The H≈çj≈ç later managed to unify most of the Kant≈ç. According to some stories, the name Aburatsubo (\\"Oil Vase\\"), comes from the time when hundreds of samurai, fleeing the troops of H≈çj≈ç, drowned in the waters of the inlet and left it a sea of blood. Aburatsubo today Aburatsubo is a \\"hurricane hole\\" where fishing boats from the area take refuge when a typhoon arrives.

According to Bloomberg News, he graduated from Harvard in 1989 with a bachelor's degree in economics. However, he can not be located in the Harvard Alumni directory as of 2015. Viktor Ko≈æen√Ω is an Irish citizen imprisoned in the Bahamas in 2005 but released in 2007. He currently lives in a gated community in the Bahamas. Efforts to bring him to justice stem from both the Czech Republic and the USA. An international warrant has been issued for Ko≈æen√Ω, who in the early 1990s ran one of the great scams of the post- Communist era. By the media he is often called \\"the pirate of Prague\\". He was imprisoned after a US extradition request, but that was refused by Bahamian authorities in October 2007. In February 2008 a court case against him and his partner Boris Vostr√Ω started at Prague Municipal Court. Ko≈æen√Ω has remained in the Bahamas and has not been attending the trial. He asked the prosecution to publish the charges on the Internet, which the state prosecutor has refused to do. His defense counsel later published the indictment upon order from Kozeny. In 2010 Kozeny was convicted of fraud by a Czech court and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and ordered to pay damages equal to hundreds of millions USD. In 2012, the judgment was reaffirmed by the High court in Prague with minor changes. An enforcement action based on this judgement has been lodged by the fraud victim in New York, targeting assets frozen by US authorities. The defendant in the case is a company owned beneficially by Kozeny's mother, Jitka Chvatik. Assets of the company have been refrozen by the court after the company lost an appeal in 2014. The case is still pending. As of January 2019, Kozeny is still internationally wanted by the Czech and US criminal justice. He is effectively confined to The Bahamas, holding his Irish passport.  Czech voucher privatization  During the voucher privatization Czech state assets were supposed to be handed over to Czech citizens through a system of vouchers, which could then be used to buy shares in companies. However mutual funds were founded, most successfully the one started by Ko≈æen√Ω, Harvard Capital and Consulting (which has no affiliation with Harvard University). Soon thousands of Czechs were signing over their voucher books to \\"Harvard\\", who promised a 1000% rate of return on investment. Harvard Funds bought shares in a number of companies, stripped assets and transferred the money abroad to offshore tax havens like the Bahamas. This scam turned out to be a huge success for Ko≈æen√Ω and those working with him, who allegedly stole millions of dollars from investors in his funds.  Azerbaijan scam  In 1994, Ko≈æen√Ω wanted to conduct a similar transaction in Azerbaijan. The country was considering privatizing its state run oil company, and Ko≈æen√Ω offered his services. US investors handed their money to him, over $400 million in total from clients such as AIG and Columbia University. The Azerbaijan government changed its mind on privatization, but Ko≈æen√Ω did not return the money and instead ran to tax haven Bahamas. Viktor Ko≈æen√Ω in an exclusive interview with Mirza Khazar of the RFE/RL Azerbaijani Service on 17 July 2001 urged Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev to fulfill his promises made in 1997‚Äì1998 concerning the privatization program in his country. According to Ko≈æen√Ω, President Aliev and his son, Ilham, personally met with him and other members of Ko≈æen√Ω's investors group in Baku and encouraged them to buy vouchers from citizens. Shortly after the first part of the interview with Viktor Ko≈æen√Ω was aired, the newspaper \\"Alternativ,\\" with close ties to the Azerbaijan President's Office, reacted promptly, claiming that President Aliev or his son Ilham never met with Ko≈æen√Ω. The paper admitted Ko≈æen√Ω may have been tricked by some officials, but rejected his claim that President Aliev made any commitments to his group. Ko≈æen√Ω faces a serious legal action by famed Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who has filed an indictment in New York for his bribery of Azeri officials. \\"Lyford Cay resident Viktor Ko≈æen√Ω, who faces 17 counts of fraud-related charges in the U.S., will either have to surrender to U.S. authorities or face extradition, according to a New York City district attorney.\\" (Bahamas News, June 9, 2005) His trial for the scam began on 1 June 2010.How Bribery Case Could Scupper U.S. Policy The Bahamian authorities later refused to turn Kozeny over to the US authorities upon a 2012 ruling of the Privy Council which stated the offense was not an extraditable one.

March 21‚Äì27, 2000. 91. Legend operated nonstop flights from its Love Field hub to Washington D.C., Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York City, the first carrier to fly from Love Field to destinations beyond the Wright Amendment five-state region after the opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in 1974. Legend's jet airliners were limited to 56 passenger seats by the Wright Amendment, so the aircraft were outfitted in a spacious all-business class layout, aiming at the lucrative business travel market. Legend's initial flights were substantially delayed by lobbying to persuade Congress to modify the Wright Amendment, court battles instigated by American Airlines and the City of Fort Worth, and by difficulties obtaining operational approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Flights began in April 2000, but were suspended indefinitely in December 2000 due to mounting losses, with the airline filing for bankruptcy. Efforts to secure additional financing and restart flights came to naught; the airline surrendered its operating certificate and was liquidated in mid-2001. The airline's private Love Field terminal‚Äîwhich was independently owned and leased to the carrier‚Äîwas condemned under eminent domain and the gates razed after the 2006 Wright Amendment repeal imposed a 20-gate cap at the airport. These events triggered a series of lawsuits that were not fully settled until 2016.  History  =Background= By the early 1960s, Love Field was reaching the limits of its capacity, and efforts to share Greater Southwest International Airport (GSW) in Fort Worth had proven unsuccessful. The situation was inefficient, and in 1964, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) ordered Dallas and Fort Worth to establish a new joint regional airport. The cities and airlines ultimately agreed, signing a 1968 bond ordinance obligating all existing carriers to move to the new regional airport and prohibiting the operation of competing municipal airports. The effort culminated in the demolition of GSW, the 1974 opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), the closure of Love Field to certified air carriers, and a corresponding effort to redevelop Love for general aviation. Southwest Airlines was founded after the 1968 bond ordinance; it was not a party to the agreement and felt that its business model would be affected by the long drive to the new airport. Dallas and Fort Worth sued Southwest but were unsuccessful in dislodging the airline from Love Field. After the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, Southwest announced plans to begin interstate service in 1979, angering powerful DFW backers. Acting on their behalf, Jim Wright, member of the U.S. House of Representatives serving Fort Worth, sponsored and helped pass an amendment to the International Air Transportation Act of 1979 in Congress that restricted passenger service out of Love Field in the following ways: * Service using larger mainline airliners could be provided from Love Field only to airports within Texas or to four neighboring U.S. states: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma. * Airlines could not offer connecting flights, through service on another airline, or through ticketing beyond the five-state region. * Flights to other states were allowed only on aircraft with 56 seats or fewer, in an attempt to prohibit mainline passenger service outside of the five-state region. By the mid-1990s, Southwest Airlines' business within the five-state region had burgeoned, but no carrier had seriously attempted to exploit the 56-seat exemption. Factions in Dallas had begun to view the Wright Amendment as anti- competitive and harmful to local business interests, but its restrictions were backed by Fort Worth and American Airlines to protect DFW Airport, and by local property owners who wanted to reduce jet noise and street traffic around Love Field. Attempts to modify the restrictions had become mired in lawsuits and controversy. =Founding and early history= Legend Airlines was the brainchild of T. Allan McArtor, former Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator, Federal Express executive and a U.S. Air Force pilot who had been a member of the Air Force precision flying team, the Thunderbirds. McArtor served as airline's President and CEO. In 1996, Dallas aviation company and Legend partner Dalfort Aviation announced that Legend would fly from Love Field using jets with 56 seats‚Äîthe maximum number allowed for long- haul flights under Wright. Dalfort would refurbish older McDonnell Douglas DC-9s or Boeing 727s‚Äîaircraft that normally carried 90 or more passengers‚Äîwith an all-first class configuration and the excess space used for cargo. McArtor and Dalfort CEO Bruce Leadbetter claimed that buying new regional jets with 56 or fewer seats was too expensive and would not provide Dalfort with much- needed overhaul business. However, the United States Department of Transportation general counsel ruled in September 1996 that the 56-seat restriction applied to the \\"designed capacity\\" of an airliner rather than to the number of seats actually installed, prompting Legend to seek a change in the law; Texas Rep. Joe Barton was soon calling for the U.S. House to address of the 56-seat requirement. By July 1997, McArtor had enlisted the help of Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who proposed to change the Wright restrictions to allow Legend to start service using the refurbished planes. On 7 October 1997, despite fierce opposition from the Texas congressional delegation, Shelby's efforts culminated in the passage of a United States Senate funding bill that included his amendment to allow nationwide flights using aircraft reconfigured with 56 seats and to add three new states to the Wright region. On 9 October 1997, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved the transportation funding bill containing the Shelby Amendment, with President Bill Clinton expected to promptly sign it into law. Within a month, Fort Worth was suing Legend and the city of Dallas, arguing for upholding the 1968 DFW bond agreement; Dallas and Legend argued that it could no longer be enforced. American Airlines joined Fort Worth in suing Dallas to stop the Shelby Amendment from taking effect, and McArtor accused American of having quietly orchestrated the entire campaign to block Legend. By February 1998, Southwest Airlines joined the Dallas lawsuit at the behest of Legend. McArtor argued that Fort Worth was also violating the bond agreement by allowing Mesa Airlines and FedEx Express to operate from Meacham Field and the recently- constructed Fort Worth Alliance Airport respectively. In October 1998, Legend sued Fort Worth, accusing the city of a \\"double standard\\" in its simultaneous support for Alliance and opposition to expansion at Love. However, State District Judge Bob McCoy dismissed the suit later that month on the grounds that Legend was not a party to the 1968 DFW bond agreement and thus lacked standing to sue. =Service begins= On 5 April 2000, after further legal battles against Fort Worth and American Airlines and delays in gaining operating approval from the FAA, Legend began the first long-haul service from Love Field since 1974 with a flight to Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD). Legend Airlines soon operated nonstop service to IAD, Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).http://www.departedflights.com, April 5, 2000 Legend Airlines system timetable LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City was then added as a fourth destination. Despite continuing to argue in court that long-haul service from Love Field should be blocked, American Airlines, in a competitive move, reconfigured several of its Fokker 100 jets with 56 seats in a similar business class-like configuration and operated nonstop service from Love Field starting on 1 May 2000 to Chicago O'Hare Airport (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX) and LaGuardia (LGA).http://www.departedflights.com, July 2, 2001 American Airlines system timetable On 29 June 2000, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a federal appeals court decision allowing long-haul flights from Love, effectively ending the last attempt by Fort Worth, the D/FW Airport Board, and American Airlines to stop Legend in the courts. =Demise= Legend spent more than most new airlines prior to starting flights; figures range from $21 million to $29 million. Its aircraft had languished on the ground for 3 years. Although its flights to New York and Washington averaged almost two-thirds capacity, the airline lost $25 million during its first six months of operation, being afflicted by high start-up costs, high fuel costs, and intense competition from other airlines. Legend suspended flights indefinitely on 3 December 2000 after failing to secure additional financing, and announced that it would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In early 2001, Legend laid off all of its Dallas employees, surrendered its FAA operating certificate, and announced that it would enter Chapter 7 liquidation. In May, McArtor left Legend to head the North American unit of Airbus, and the airline's physical assets were auctioned in June 2001, including an estimated $1 million in DC-9 spares, but not the aircraft themselves, which were leased. By late 2002, two of the airline's former DC-9s were being operated by Southeast Airlines, one had been purchased by the Columbus Blue Jackets hockey team, and the other four had been mothballed in Kingman, Arizona awaiting new buyers. In 2016, journalist Robert Wilonsky described the airline's downfall as the result of a conspiracy by American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, the D/FW Airport Board, and the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth to \\"break Legend before it ever got off the ground.\\" Despite its failure to establish a viable aviation business, industry observers credited Legend Airlines with engineering the first substantive change to the controversial Wright Amendment and with introducing competition to Southwest Airlines at Love Field; when Legend ceased operation, American, Continental Express, and Delta Connection affiliate Atlantic Southeast Airlines had all begun operating from the airport to compete with the startup carrier. Legend's activities prompted other aviation interests to seriously consider using regional jets on long-haul flights from Love Field and to more openly back changes to the Wright Amendment, ideas that seemed infeasible beforehand. The Wright Amendment region was subsequently expanded again in 2005, and the law was partially repealed in 2006 and fully repealed in 2014. In-flight services Aiming for the lucrative full-fare business travel market, Legend Airlines provided a high level of service, with all seats in a business class configuration. Two wide seats were installed on each side of the generous center aisle (known as a 2-2 arrangement), and legroom was ample due to the removal of several entire rows of seats from its McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliners, which usually carried 100 or more passengers in a 2-3 arrangement. Fresh flowers adorned aircraft interiors and the executive terminal at Love Field; the latter was set up so passengers could exit their aircraft and board a taxi in less than a minute. Legend was the first airline to offer live in-flight television on seat-back monitors; the DirecTV service was soon offered by JetBlue as well, but Legend offered it for free rather than charging travelers $5 to use it. Seats were also equipped with an AT&T; Airfones\\"Legend Airlines‚Ä¶non-stop non-coach.\\" Legend Airlines. Retrieved on February 16, 2009. and laptop computer charging ports. The lavish meals, described as \\"celebrity-chef crafted\\", were commissioned from several Dallas-area chefs and were served on real china with silverware, fresh fruit, and individual pats of real butter, rather than the plastic trays, plastic utensils, and packaged condiments and fruit generally offered by other carriers. Meals came with a ribbon-tied box of chocolate truffles and wines selected to complement the food. All of these amenities were offered for fares comparable to rival airlines' coach-class tickets. Executive terminal Legend operated a separate executive passenger terminal at 7777 Lemmon Avenue and Lovers Lane and did not use the primary passenger terminal at Love Field. The Legend terminal cost $20 million to construct and reflected the airline's upscale image, with leather seats, fresh flowers, and gates designed to resemble private executive clubs. The complex was built by and leased from a private investment group loosely affiliated with Legend and Dalfort Aviation but not directly controlled by either company. Upon Legend's collapse, the owners immediately sought new tenants, subleasing one gate to Atlantic Southeast Airlines and entering into talks with American and Continental Express, who were then sharing the only two gates in the main terminal that were not controlled by Southwest Airlines. Despite the owner's efforts, the gates were vacant by the summer of 2002, although some office space had been leased to local businesses and parking garage space was being leased to nearby car dealerships to store inventory. In late 2005, the owners were publicly backing an effort to repeal the Wright Amendment, hoping to boost the lease value of the still-vacant gates; however, Dallas mayor Laura Miller was openly campaigning for the structure to be torn down. In October 2006, President George W. Bush signed a law partially repealing the Wright Amendment and imposing a 20-gate cap at Love Field, and the Dallas City Council approved using eminent domain to seize and raze the terminal. This effectively ended negotiations to sell the facility to Pinnacle Airlines, and the gates were subsequently condemned by the federal government and torn down, with the owners receiving nothing in return. The owners attempted to challenge the Wright Amendment repeal on antitrust grounds but the suit was thrown out by the federal courts in late 2007. However, the owners filed another suit in 2008 accusing the federal government of having condemned the structure without just compensation, and in April 2016, Federal Claims Judge Margaret M. Sweeney sided with owners Love Terminal Partners and Virginia Aerospace, ordering the government to pay them $133 million-plus interest for having destroyed the property's economic value.

B. tyroni is native to subtropical coastal Queensland and northern New South Wales. They are active during the day, but mate at night. B. tyroni lay their eggs in fruit. The larvae then hatch and proceed to consume the fruit, causing the fruit to decay and drop prematurely. B. tyroni are responsible for an estimated $28.5 million a year in damage to Australian crops and are the most costly horticultural pest in Australia. Up to 100% of exposed fruit can be destroyed due to an infestation of this fly species. Previously, pesticides were used to eliminate B. tyroni from damaging crops. However, these chemicals are now banned. Thus, experts devoted to B. tyroni control have transitioned to studying this pests' behaviors to determine a new method of elimination.  Identification  Adult B. tyroni flies are reddish brown in color, have distinct yellow markings and are typically 5‚Äì8 mm in length. Adults hold their wings horizontally when walking and flick them in a specific, characteristic manner. The wingspan of B. tyroni ranges from 4.8-6.3 mm. B. tyroni may be mistaken for wasps as they appear wasp-like. = Complex/Sister Species = They are part of a complex, or a group of morphologically similar but biologically distinct species. These are called sibling species. B. tyroni has three sibling species: B. neohumeralis, B. aquilonis, and B. melas. All of these flies are sympatric, meaning that they inhabit the same territory, except B. aquilonas, which inhabits a different geographical area in northwest Australia. Genetic data has suggested that B. aquilonas is simply an allopatric population of B. tryoni. Additionally, B. tryoni mate at night, while B. neohumeralis mate during the day. More pertinently, B. neohumeralis are not pests; they do not destroy crops. Despite this behavioral difference, B. neohumeralis and B. tyroni are nearly genetically identical: the two species are only differentiable based on newly-developed microsatellite technology.. The evolutionary relationship between the species within the B. tryoni complex is unknown.  Distribution and Habitat  B. tyroni prefer humid and warm climates. Thus, they are most widespread in eastern Australia, as well as New Caledonia, French Polynesia, the Pitcairn Islands, and the Cook Islands. Commercial fruit production has increased in Australia, leading to an increased geographical area in which B. tyroni can reside, extending as far inland as central Queensland and New South Wales. Occasionally, there are outbreaks of B. tyroni in southern and western Australia; however, the coastal areas of Australia are relatively isolated from one another due to harsh, dry weather conditions in intervening regions that are unsuitable for B. tyroni. Therefore, other regions of Australia typically remain free of this pest as long as infected fruit is not transported between regions. Life cycle = Egg = After passing through a two week pre-oviposition stage following emergence from the pupae, adult females deposit around seven eggs in a fruit puncture, and may deposit up to 100 eggs per day. Fruit punctures are holes in the skin of the fruit that allow the females to access the nutrient rich interior. Females often oviposit in punctures made by other fruit flies, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), which results in many eggs occurring in a single cavity.Gomulski, L. M., Pitts, R. J., Costa, S., Saccone, G., Torti, C., Polito, L. C., Gasperi, G., Malacrida, A. R., Kafatos, F. C., Zwiebel, L. J. Genomic Organization and Characterization of the white Locus of the Mediterranean Fruitfly, Ceratitis capitata Genetics 2001 157: 1245-1255 Full text Additionally, B. tyroni females can create their own puncture to oviposit in the fruit, called a \\"sting.\\" = Maggot (Larval) = Eggs hatch into white larvae in 2‚Äì4 days under favorable weather conditions. These larvae, or maggots, eat toward the center of the fruit with their cutting jaws, causing it to rot. The maggots may reach up to 9 mm in length; larval development is completed in 10-31 days. At this point, the fruit has likely fallen to the ground. Up to 40 larvae can be reared from a single piece of fruit. = Pupal = The maggot chews its way out of the remaining fruit and enters the soil, where it enters the pupal stage of development. Pupal development requires various temperature ranges from one week in warmer weather to one month in cooler conditions. The flexible amount of time needed for pupal development has resulted in B. tyroni relative adaptiveness to different environments. = Adult = After the pupal stage is complete, adults emerge from the soil. This typically occurs near the end of the summer season. Unlike other fly pests, B. tryoni does not breed continuously, but spends the winter in the adult stage. Adult females live many months, and up to four or five overlapping generations may occur annually. Adults may live for a year or longer.  Behavior  = Host Selection = B. tyroni have been found to infect almost all commercial fruit crops as hosts, including abiu, apple, avocado, babaco, capsicum, carambola, casimiroa, cherry, citrus, custard apple, granadilla, grape, guava, kiwifruit, mango, nectarine, papaya, passionfruit, peach, pear, persimmon, plum, pomegranate, prune, quince, loquat, santol, spodilla, tamarillo, tomato, and wax jambu, with the exception of pineapples. B. tyroni strongly prefer to oviposit into rotting fruit, although some evidence suggests that they will oviposit into under-ripe fruit as well. B. tyroni prefer to select fruits that have an outer layer that is able to be punctured or has already been lesioned. The majority of research on B. tyroni host selection has included just a few, economically important crops. = Adult Feeding Behavior = Larvae feed only on the flesh of fruit until they mature into adulthood. Adult flies, however, rely on leaf surface bacteria as a major source of protein. There is some evidence suggesting that the bacteria and flies co-evolved, but other data suggest that this symbiosis does not occur as the presence of protein-providing bacteria is not consistent throughout B. tyroni populations. Due to this dependence on protein originating from bacteria, it is possible to control the population by providing flies with artificial protein mixed with insecticide. = Mating Behavior = B. tyroni flies mate at dusk. This is pertinent to control efforts because it is one of the few characteristics that distinguish it from sister species, B. neohumeralis, which are not a highly destructive species, even though the two are very closely related genetically and evolutionarily. = Cue-Lure in Males = B. tyroni males exhibit behavior termed cue-lure, meaning that they are strongly attracted to a specific scent. While this scent is artificially made, it is closely related to compounds occurring in nature. Male B. tyroni respond most greatly to the lure in the morning, likely because this is their peak of foraging time; however, an evolutionary reason for the cue-lure is not fully known. Cue-lure is only exhibited in sexually mature males, indicating that mate finding is related to the cue-lure behavior. However, other Bactrocera species have been identified as means of enhancing male competitiveness, or to afford protection from predation. = Ovipositional Behavior = B. tyroni lay their eggs in fruit. Females prefer to lay their eggs in fruit that is sweet, juicy, and not acidic. The presence of other female flies in pre- or post- oviposition on a piece of fruit was found to have no bearing on another female's likeliness to land on the fruit; however, female flies were more likely to bore into a piece of fruit that other female flies were currently ovipositing into, therefore increasing the density of larvae within a single piece of fruit. This is an example of reciprocal altruism as larvae are at an advantage at higher densities. = Movement and Dispersal = B. tyroni have evolved to disperse widely, which was greatly influenced their ability to cause damage to farms. When fruit is available, the flies often do not disperse far distances (only a few hundred meters to a kilometer), but they have been found to travel large distances in the absence of fruit. In addition to lack of resources, adult flies may also move to locate overwintering sites or avoid dry or cold weather.  Genomic studies  The genome of B. tryoni has been sequenced and published by a group at the University of New South Wales, Australia. While the coding regions are mostly completely sequenced, about one-third of the genome appears to consist of highly repetitive sequences.  Control Efforts  B. tyroni has been the subject of extensive control regimens. One of these regimens is a Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone (FFEZ), where transporting fruit into certain regions of Australia and Polynesia is illegal. In May 2012, January 2013, February 2015, and February 2019, the fly was found in Auckland, posing a risk to horticulture and leading to a quarantine (see Biosecurity in New Zealand). = Lure and Kill Tactics = Farmers in effected regions are encouraged to use a lure and kill tactic to combat the presence of B. tyroni. Lure and kill tactics include the use of some sort of bait that attracts the pest, or a lure. This can include semiochemical lures such as pheromones, food attractants, host mimics, or color attractants. The killing mechanism often involves pesticides, liquid traps in which the pest drowns, or sticky traps that the pest cannot escape from. At low densities of B. tyroni, lure and kill tactics are most effective as a mechanism to monitor the frequency of B. tyroni; at high densities, they effectively combat the pest via population reduction. Two of the most common lure and kill approaches for B. tyroni are the male annihilation technique (MAT) and the protein-bait spray (PBS).  Protein-Bait Spray  Both male and female B. tyroni require proteins produced by bacteria found on the leaves of plants in order to reach sexual maturity. The protein-bait spray takes advantage of this behavior by combining necessary proteins normally acquired from leaf bacteria with deadly insecticides. The combination of protein and insecticide attracts B. tyroni of both sexes, resulting in elimination of adult flies. Neither the effectiveness of this technique, nor the scientific underpinnings of what protein exactly attracts B. tyroni to the spray, are well investigated.  Male Annihilation Technique  B. tyroni sexually mature males are strongly responsive to specific scents that may be associated with mating, or a cue-lure. A specific cue-lure, Willson's lure, was found to be incredibly effective at attracting sexually mature B. tyroni males. When combined with insecticides, artificially developed cue lures may be an effective elimination method of sexually mature males. While extensive research has suggested this is an effective strategy in other fly species, very few controlled experiments have been conducted to determine the effectiveness of the male annihilation technique in B. tyroni. = Dimethoate and Fenthion = Control efforts include submerging post- harvest fruit and treating fields of fruit trees with the chemicals dimethoate and fenthion. As of October 2011, the use of these chemicals was under review by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. As a result, dimethoate was suspended from use.Chemical review: dimethoate on APVMA website As of 2014, fenthion was no longer commercially available in Australia. = Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) = Containment efforts have included irradiating pupae in order to induce sterility. A study testing the viability of this technique found that sterility was dose independent, meaning that a single ionizing event was enough to render the male sperm sterile. Additionally, it was found that emergence and flight ability remained unaffected by the ionizing event. This indicates that males sterilized via a low dosage of radiation were equally as competitive as males that were not irradiated. = The White Locus = A popular method for controlling populations of invasive or destructive species of flies involves producing a strain of fly that is incapable of reproducing. If this can be accomplished, this strain can be mass produced and released into the wild without necessitating repeated exposure to irradiation as required in methods such as the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT).If they have the same sexual competitiveness as wild type males, then the species‚Äô overall population will presumably decrease. In order to accomplish developing such a strain in B. tyroni, molecular tools capable of genetically transforming B. tyroni must be implemented. One such strain of a genetically compatible fly has been developed in Drosophila melanogaster. The phenotypic marker for the presence of an efficient vector for gene transfer is white eye color. Development of a genetically engineered B. tyroni strain that is compatible with gene transfer was successful; however, scientists have yet to develop a sterile strain that can be released into the wild.  Climate Change  While this species is native to northeastern Australia, rising temperatures due to climate change has allowed the species to spread to other regions of Australia and Polynesia. B. tyroni are able to tolerate extremely high temperatures but have a minimum necessary temperature to breed; therefore, global warming has fostered their spread across Australia and Polynesia. Although B. tyroni have a minimum temperature requirement for survival, extreme plasticity and adaptation has been observed in adult B. tyroni. This adaptation has allowed them to survive in cooler temperatures and at higher altitudes. This behavior, combined with global warming, indicates that damage due to these insects will continue to increase as the temperatures continue to rise. One study predicted that farm damage due to Queensland fruit flies will increase by $3.1, $4.7, and $12.0 million with temperature increases of 0.5, 1 and 2 ¬∞C, respectively. = Simulations of Climate Change = Rising CO2 levels may influence the distribution of B. tyroni. Based upon recent studies which utilize computer programs to simulate B. tyroni distribution in the event of rising temperatures, it was predicted that there will be an overall increase in Queensland fruit fly damage, but the fruit flies will re-localize to more southerly locations as northern and central Queensland will begin to exceed the maximum habitable temperature of B. tyroni. However, these simulations may not accurately predict the future distributions of B. tyroni as they have exhibited an immense capability to adapt to various conditions. The prediction is also complicated by the uncertainty of how the relative humidity will change in regions across Australia as temperature increases, and B. tyroni survival is heavily dependent upon a humid climate.

The school is part of the Barnstable Public School District. Barnstable High School was founded in the 19th century and was located on High School Road in Hyannis before relocating to its current location on West Main Street in 1959. The school has had several major renovations and building additions over the years, most recently in 1998. History =First permanent location= Barnstable High School never really had a permanent location until 1905, when a building was erected at the present site of Saint John Paul II High School. In 1930, the building was rebuilt. The building was renovated in 1939, due to the increase of students, but it was decided that a new school should be built using land willed to the town by Enoch Cobb. =Modern building= The modern high school building was built from 1956‚Äì1957. On September 5, 1957, the new building was officially opened. The original layout included the modern 1200s, 1300s, 1400s, and 1500s. The original layout lacked the present library and cafeteria, which were added later on. The original library was located near the entrance to the modern library. A unique feature of the building were the two cafeterias. One cafeteria was located near on the site of the weight room and athletic office, and the kitchen was also located on the site of the present weight room. The field house was also absent in the original layout. Originally, the high school hosted a vocational school in the modern lower 1200s. The basement of the original building also was built as a bomb shelter, not unusual during the Cold War. The completion of the school did not mean an end to the usage of the old building's facilities. When the school was completed, it lacked athletic fields, which were still under construction. For at least the first year, sporting events were held at the old building. In 1963, the modern 1600s wing was added. The school underwent a renovation in 1976, which added the field house, cafeteria, library and some classrooms nearby. In 1975, the vocational high school closed because of the opening of Cape Cod Regional Technical High School in Harwich. The wing was then turned into the art wing for the school. Mechanical drawing was one of the classes offered in the old shop wing. In 2019, the library completed a $3.5M renovation, which was overseen by librarian Sharon Morgan, who has been the center of some serious allegations of misconduct. $1M of the total $3.5M renovation budget was spent on \\"Smart Glass\\" that helps control temperature by brightening or darkening based on the amount of available light outside. The new library consists of comfortable seating areas, moveable modular furniture with plug-ins for laptops and interactive television screens everywhere.

The number of elementary schools was reduced from 18 at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 school year. The district also serves the city of Sierra Madre and the unincorporated community of Altadena. PUSD is run by a board of education, whose members serve four-year terms. Duties of the board include budgeting, approving expenditures, establishing policy, making employment decisions, approving textbooks and courses of study, and approving academic initiatives. As of June 2012, PUSD's at-large board districts became geographic subdistricts. As of May 1, 2017, the members of the PUSD Board of Education are Kimberly Kenne (District 1), Roy Boulghourjian (District 2, President), Michelle Richardson-Bailey (District 3), Patrick Cahalan (District 4, Clerk), Dr. Elizabeth Pomeroy (District 5), Lawrence Torres (District 6, Vice President) and Scott Phelps (District 7). History In its early history, Pasadena had some of the highest performing schools in the state, largely due to a strong affiliation with the California Institute of Technology. Two schools in the area, Noyes Elementary (now closed) and Hale Elementary (now Norma Coombs Elementary School), were named after Caltech professors. In January 1970, as supplemented in March 1970, desegregation busing was ordered in the district after the federal court ordered desegregation of the public schools in Pasadena. This was a result of the city demographics of the time, which resulted in a \\"de facto\\" segregation, with a large proportion of the African American population attending schools in the northwest area of the city (which was largely African American), and the white students attending schools in the east and southern parts. Before the busing plan was implemented in September 1970, the proportion of white students in public schools reflected the proportion of whites in the community (54 percent and 53 percent, respectively). Shortly after busing began, a significant segment of upper- and middle-class families that could afford private schooling pulled their children out of the public school system. The result was a boom of private schooling available in the city, and a reduction of state funding for Pasadena public schools as enrollment was reduced. The PUSD also hosted an \\"alternative\\" school in the early 1970s: the Evening High School. First envisioned for students that had to work during the daytime to support their families, the school was quickly populated with students who were disenchanted with the schooling experience at other Pasadena High Schools such as Pasadena High, Muir and Blair. Evening High was located on the campus of Blair High and operated in the evening hours between 4 and 9. Paul Finot was the man behind the idea that originated from his time in POW camps during the Korean War. A group of people need to self-organize to succeed. Finot transformed his experience in the camps into a high school environment where every student was encouraged to govern their school and environment. In 2002, Superintendent Percy Clark reduced the number of students bused in the district and expanded a policy of neighborhood schools. By 2004 Pasadena was home to sixty-three private schools, which educated one-third of all school-aged children in the city, and the proportion of white students in the public schools had fallen to 16 percent. One current (as of 2014) board member, Renatta Cooper, has stated that Pasadena has more private schools per capita than any city its size in the United States. By 2006, Allendale, Edison, Linda Vista, and Noyes elementary schools closed in 2008, such as Edison Elementary is now replaced with Focus Point Academy, a Special Education school, while Allendale was used as a temporary site for Blair IB Magnet Middle School students while the new middle school campus was under construction. For the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, Pasadena Unified mounted a drive to stop interdistrict transfers out of the district. This was mainly directed at children entering kindergarten, first, seventh, and ninth grades, citing these as \\"transition\\" years. They included first grade as a transition year because kindergarten is not required by the State of California. For the 2011-2012 school year, Blair International Baccalaureate School opened a new middle school campus. By the start of the 2015‚Äì2016 school year, Sierra Madre Middle School will be opening a brand new campus, which will increase the number of middle schools to four, and Don Benito Fundamental and Norma Coombs Alternative Schools will now become neighborhood elementary schools, while Field Elementary becomes a Mandarin DLIP (Dual Language Immersion Program) and San Rafael Elementary become a Spanish Dual Language Immersion Program. Starting in 2013, school board members will be elected by geographical districts, which replaces a seat number and at large, with the primary/runoff format, similar to the Pasadena City Council, there are seven geographical districts, Districts 1, 3, 5, and 7 starting with the 2013 elections, while Districts 2, 4, and 6 starting with the 2015 elections, thanks to a ballot measure passage by the voters during the 2012 California Primary election. Voters in the Pasadena Unified School District voted during the June 2018 election to extend the terms of the seven School Board members to an additional 19 months, with Districts 2, 4 and 6 effective with the November 2020 election and Districts 1, 3, 5 and 7 with the November 2022 election. The elections are replaced with the plurality format instead of the primary/runoff format effective in November 2020. Starting in 2015‚Äì16 school year, high school attendance boundaries had changes: Blair International Baccalaureate School is serving downtown and southwest Pasadena, while John Muir High School is serving northwest Pasadena and the Linda Vista neighborhood as well as the western portion of Altadena, and Pasadena High School is serving the eastern portion of Altadena, Sierra Madre, as well as the central, eastern, and southeastern portions of Pasadena. In 2012, the district was the subject a 90-minute documentary film titled Go Public. The documentary was filmed by 50 crews following the stories of various people in 28 schools for one day, intended to portray the positive and negative realities in a moderate-sized public education system.

It has a land area of and a 2000 census population of 2,225 persons. The major town and capital of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe is Fort Thompson. The town is located adjacent to the Big Bend Dam, which holds back Big Bend Reservoir (also known as Lake Sharpe), one of the four Missouri Mainstem reservoirs constructed by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the Pick-Sloan Plan. Authorized in 1944 for flood control and hydropower, the dam and lake were completed in the 1960s. History The people of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe are mostly descendants of the Mdewakanton Dakota Tribe of the south and central Minnesota, who settled on the reservation after escape or exile from Minnesota following the Dakota War of 1862 in Minnesota. Some Yankton and lower Yanktonai Dakota also reside on the reservation. Although considered to be a part of the Great Sioux Reservation by some writers, the Crow Creek Reservation, established in 1862, has always been separate. The reservation originally included bottomlands along Missouri, which had been farmed previously by Mandan and Arikara, and others prior to these tribes. The peoples were decimated in smallpox and other epidemics in the 18th century. Today several former Mandan and Arikara villages are archaeological sites located within the Crow Creek Reservation. Within the reservation are two pre-contact archeological sites that have been designated as National Historic Landmarks. Fort Thompson Mounds is an archeological site from c. 800, with evidence of some of the first pottery makers on the plains. The Crow Creek Massacre Site has revealed evidence of fierce conflict between Native American cultures about 1325 AD, likely when they were competing for resources at a time of climate and habitat change.Bamforth, Douglas and Curtis Nepstad-Thornberry, 2007. \\"Reconsidering the Occupational History of the Crow Creek Site (39BF11)\\", Plains Anthropologist 52 (202:153-173).Gregg, John B. and Pauline Gregg, 1987. Dry Bones: Dakota Territory Reflected. University of South Dakota Press: Vermillion. The development of Lake Sharpe following completion of the Big Bend Dam flooded much of this land, forcing relocation of Fort Thompson and other settlements. Loss of the most productive, fertile bottomlands worsened the economic conditions in the area. Allotment and land sales reduced the amount of land in both tribal and Indian ownership, and the size of the Reservation was reduced by governmental action between its establishment in 1862 and modern times. The reservation and the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe is organized into three districts. The tribe runs its own school, the Crow Creek Tribal Schools system, with an elementary school at Fort Thompson and a K-12 boarding and day school at Stephan, approximately north of Fort Thompson. Most of the tribe's land is leased to a few large ranching families. Unemployment is high. The tribe operates the Lode Star Casino and Hotel, attracting tourists to the reservation; as well as to the archaeological sites, Lake Sharpe's fishing and boating, and casual travelers. The reservation is located southeast of Pierre and north of Chamberlain. It is reached via South Dakota Highway 47 or South Dakota Highway 50 off Interstate 90, or via South Dakota Highway 34 east from Pierre. The Lower Brule Indian Reservation is located on the west bank of the Missouri River, directly across from the Crow Creek Reservation. In 2002 a monument was dedicated at Big Bend Dam. The Spirit of the Circle Monument honors the more than 1,300 people who died of malnutrition and exposure over a three-year period in the 1860s at the reservation following the forcible removal of the Santee Dakota to this site, which resulted from their defeat in the Dakota War of 1862, and Winnebago, forcibly removed to this site from Minnesota at the same time. Conditions were so bad that the Winnebago and many of the Santee fled to new homes down the Missouri River, resulting in the creation of the Santee Indian Reservation and Winnebago Indian Reservations in Nebraska.

History MarkAir Boeing 737-400 in 1992 The airline began its operations as Interior Airways in late 1946 carrying cargo throughout the American territory of Alaska. In the late 1960s the airline bought Lockheed L-382 Hercules aircraft to service construction of the Alaska Pipeline. In 1972 it changed its name to Alaska International Air to reflect its international charter business. In 1980 Alaska International Air bought a regional passenger/cargo airline named Great Northern Airways. In 1984 new colors and the name MarkAir (reportedly named after a newsboy named Mark) were brought to the airline as it inaugurated passenger/cargo service from Anchorage to the Alaska bush communities of Barrow, Bethel, Dillingham, Fairbanks, King Salmon, Kotzebue, Nome, and Prudhoe Bay/Deadhorse. The airline had purchased Boeing 737-200 Combi cargo/passenger aircraft to operate these services. In the mid-1980s, MarkAir and Alaska Airlines entered into a codesharing agreement with MarkAir operating as Alaska Airlines to the communities of Dillingham, Dutch Harbor, Barrow, Aniak, St. Mary's and Alaska Airlines feeding MarkAir from its routes from Seattle and other \\"lower 48\\" destinations. In the late 1980s MarkAir bought several air taxis (airlines operating small six to nine seat aircraft from larger communities such as Bethel to Alaska's Native villages) and purchased several Beechcraft 1900 aircraft; and under the name of MarkAir Express operated new service from Anchorage to Cordova, Aniak, McGrath, Dillingham, King Salmon, Galena, Unalakleet, Kodiak, Kenai, Homer and Valdez. By 1990 MarkAir was the State of Alaska's largest airline. In 1990, Alaska Airlines abruptly cancelled its codesharing agreement with MarkAir and MarkAir inaugurated service in key Alaska Airlines markets such as Anchorage-Seattle, Anchorage-Juneau-Sitka- Ketchikan-Seattle, Seattle-Los Angeles, Seattle-San Francisco and Seattle- Portland. In 1992 the airline expanded its lower 48 route network to include Seattle-Chicago/Midway and Denver. However, the head-to-head competition with Alaska Airlines, although it forced major cuts with the latter, following Alaska Airlines' loss post of US$121 million, caused MarkAir to find itself in bankruptcy by the end of 1992. In 1993, MarkAir restructured itself as a \\"low fare\\" carrier and cut most routes out of Seattle with the exception of Seattle-Anchorage and Seattle-Los Angeles. The airline established a hub in Denver and served various West Coast, Midwest, East Coast and Southern cities.http://www.departedflights.com, Jan. 2, 1995 MarkAir route map In 1994, city and business officials from Denver, Colorado hoped to persuade MarkAir to move its headquarters to Denver.Rebchook, John. \\"MarkAir Circling Denver City and Business Officials Hope they can Persuade Alaska's Maverick Airline to Move its Headquarters.\\" The Rocky Mountain News. July 31, 1994. Retrieved on December 14, 2009. In 1995, faced with bankruptcy again, the airline cut all jet services within the state of Alaska and in order to concentrate on its Denver hub, which was the new location of the new MarkAir headquarters. MarkAir Express (known to the locals and the competition as \\"Skidmark\\") continued services within the state of Alaska, taking over all of MarkAir's jet routes. MarkAir was forced to shut down in 1995 and MarkAir Express was reorganized in 1996 into the all-cargo carrier Alaska Central Express.

Neural tissue can generate oscillatory activity in many ways, driven either by mechanisms within individual neurons or by interactions between neurons. In individual neurons, oscillations can appear either as oscillations in membrane potential or as rhythmic patterns of action potentials, which then produce oscillatory activation of post-synaptic neurons. At the level of neural ensembles, synchronized activity of large numbers of neurons can give rise to macroscopic oscillations, which can be observed in an electroencephalogram. Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns. The interaction between neurons can give rise to oscillations at a different frequency than the firing frequency of individual neurons. A well- known example of macroscopic neural oscillations is alpha activity. Neural oscillations were observed by researchers as early as 1924 (by Hans Berger). More than 50 years later, intrinsic oscillatory behavior was encountered in vertebrate neurons, but its functional role is still not fully understood. The possible roles of neural oscillations include feature binding, information transfer mechanisms and the generation of rhythmic motor output. Over the last decades more insight has been gained, especially with advances in brain imaging. A major area of research in neuroscience involves determining how oscillations are generated and what their roles are. Oscillatory activity in the brain is widely observed at different levels of organization and is thought to play a key role in processing neural information. Numerous experimental studies support a functional role of neural oscillations; a unified interpretation, however, is still lacking. Hz. Upper panel shows spiking of individual neurons (with each dot representing an individual action potential within the population of neurons), and the lower panel the local field potential reflecting their summed activity. Figure illustrates how synchronized patterns of action potentials may result in macroscopic oscillations that can be measured outside the scalp.  History  Richard Caton discovered electrical activity in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys and presented his findings in 1875. Adolf Beck published in 1890 his observations of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs that included rhythmic oscillations altered by light detected with electrodes directly placed on the surface of the brain. Before Hans Berger, Vladimir Vladimirovich Pravdich-Neminsky published the first animal EEG and the evoked potential of a dog.  Overview  Neural oscillations are observed throughout the central nervous system at all levels, and include spike trains, local field potentials and large-scale oscillations which can be measured by electroencephalography (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase. These signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using time-frequency analysis. In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a neural ensemble, also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize. Neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as information transfer, perception, motor control and memory. Neural oscillations have been most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad spectral content similar to pink noise, but also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is alpha activity (8‚Äì12 Hz) that can be detected from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed. Other frequency bands are: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), low gamma (30-70 Hz), and high gamma (70-150 Hz) frequency bands, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity have been linked to cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves. In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their spectral content. Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as awareness and consciousness. Although neural oscillations in human brain activity are mostly investigated using EEG recordings, they are also observed using more invasive recording techniques such as single-unit recordings. Neurons can generate rhythmic patterns of action potentials or spikes. Some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies, so-called resonators. Bursting is another form of rhythmic spiking. Spiking patterns are considered fundamental for information coding in the brain. Oscillatory activity can also be observed in the form of subthreshold membrane potential oscillations (i.e. in the absence of action potentials). If numerous neurons spike in synchrony, they can give rise to oscillations in local field potentials. Quantitative models can estimate the strength of neural oscillations in recorded data. Neural oscillations are commonly studied from a mathematical framework and belong to the field of \\"neurodynamics\\", an area of research in the cognitive sciences that places a strong focus upon the dynamic character of neural activity in describing brain function. It considers the brain a dynamical system and uses differential equations to describe how neural activity evolves over time. In particular, it aims to relate dynamic patterns of brain activity to cognitive functions such as perception and memory. In very abstract form, neural oscillations can be analyzed analytically. When studied in a more physiologically realistic setting, oscillatory activity is generally studied using computer simulations of a computational model. The functions of neural oscillations are wide- ranging and vary for different types of oscillatory activity. Examples are the generation of rhythmic activity such as a heartbeat and the neural binding of sensory features in perception, such as the shape and color of an object. Neural oscillations also play an important role in many neurological disorders, such as excessive synchronization during seizure activity in epilepsy or tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease. Oscillatory activity can also be used to control external devices in brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces, in which subjects can control an external device by changing the amplitude of particular brain rhythmics . Physiology Oscillatory activity is observed throughout the central nervous system at all levels of organization. Three different levels have been widely recognized: the micro-scale (activity of a single neuron), the meso-scale (activity of a local group of neurons) and the macro-scale (activity of different brain regions). Tonic firing pattern of single neuron showing rhythmic spiking activity = Microscopic = Neurons generate action potentials resulting from changes in the electric membrane potential. Neurons can generate multiple action potentials in sequence forming so-called spike trains. These spike trains are the basis for neural coding and information transfer in the brain. Spike trains can form all kinds of patterns, such as rhythmic spiking and bursting, and often display oscillatory activity. Oscillatory activity in single neurons can also be observed in sub- threshold fluctuations in membrane potential. These rhythmic changes in membrane potential do not reach the critical threshold and therefore do not result in an action potential. They can result from postsynaptic potentials from synchronous inputs or from intrinsic properties of neurons. Neuronal spiking can be classified by their activity patterns. The excitability of neurons can be subdivided in Class I and II. Class I neurons can generate action potentials with arbitrarily low frequency depending on the input strength, whereas Class II neurons generate action potentials in a certain frequency band, which is relatively insensitive to changes in input strength. Class II neurons are also more prone to display sub-threshold oscillations in membrane potential. = Mesoscopic = A group of neurons can also generate oscillatory activity. Through synaptic interactions, the firing patterns of different neurons may become synchronized and the rhythmic changes in electric potential caused by their action potentials will add up (constructive interference). That is, synchronized firing patterns result in synchronized input into other cortical areas, which gives rise to large-amplitude oscillations of the local field potential. These large-scale oscillations can also be measured outside the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The electric potentials generated by single neurons are far too small to be picked up outside the scalp, and EEG or MEG activity always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation. Neurons in a neural ensemble rarely all fire at exactly the same moment, i.e. fully synchronized. Instead, the probability of firing is rhythmically modulated such that neurons are more likely to fire at the same time, which gives rise to oscillations in their mean activity (see figure at top of page). As such, the frequency of large-scale oscillations does not need to match the firing pattern of individual neurons. Isolated cortical neurons fire regularly under certain conditions, but in the intact brain cortical cells are bombarded by highly fluctuating synaptic inputs and typically fire seemingly at random. However, if the probability of a large group of neurons is rhythmically modulated at a common frequency, they will generate oscillations in the mean field (see also figure at top of page). Neural ensembles can generate oscillatory activity endogenously through local interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In particular, inhibitory interneurons play an important role in producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation and rhythmically modulating the firing rate of excitatory neurons. = Macroscopic = Neural oscillation can also arise from interactions between different brain areas coupled through the structural connectome. Time delays play an important role here. Because all brain areas are bidirectionally coupled, these connections between brain areas form feedback loops. Positive feedback loops tend to cause oscillatory activity where frequency is inversely related to the delay time. An example of such a feedback loop is the connections between the thalamus and cortex ‚Äì the thalamocortical radiations. This thalamocortical network is able to generate oscillatory activity known as recurrent thalamo-cortical resonance. The thalamocortical network plays an important role in the generation of alpha activity. In a whole-brain network model with realistic anatomical connectivity and propagation delays between brain areas, oscillations in the beta frequency range emerge from the partial synchronisation of subsets of brain areas oscillating in the gamma-band (generated at the mesoscopic level). Mechanisms = Neuronal properties = Scientists have identified some intrinsic neuronal properties that play an important role in generating membrane potential oscillations. In particular, voltage-gated ion channels are critical in the generation of action potentials. The dynamics of these ion channels have been captured in the well-established Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model that describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated by means of a set of differential equations. Using bifurcation analysis, different oscillatory varieties of these neuronal models can be determined, allowing for the classification of types of neuronal responses. The oscillatory dynamics of neuronal spiking as identified in the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model closely agree with empirical findings. In addition to periodic spiking, subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, i.e. resonance behavior that does not result in action potentials, may also contribute to oscillatory activity by facilitating synchronous activity of neighboring neurons. Like pacemaker neurons in central pattern generators, subtypes of cortical cells fire bursts of spikes (brief clusters of spikes) rhythmically at preferred frequencies. Bursting neurons have the potential to serve as pacemakers for synchronous network oscillations, and bursts of spikes may underlie or enhance neuronal resonance. = Network properties = Apart from intrinsic properties of neurons, biological neural network properties are also an important source of oscillatory activity. Neurons communicate with one another via synapses and affect the timing of spike trains in the post-synaptic neurons. Depending on the properties of the connection, such as the coupling strength, time delay and whether coupling is excitatory or inhibitory, the spike trains of the interacting neurons may become synchronized. Neurons are locally connected, forming small clusters that are called neural ensembles. Certain network structures promote oscillatory activity at specific frequencies. For example, neuronal activity generated by two populations of interconnected inhibitory and excitatory cells can show spontaneous oscillations that are described by the Wilson-Cowan model. If a group of neurons engages in synchronized oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator. Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale. Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity. Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the thalamus and the cortex (see thalamocortical oscillation), involve time-delays due to the finite conduction velocity of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form feed-back loops that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form large scale brain networks, whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of spectral analysis and Granger causality measures.Andrea Brovelli, Steven L. Bressler and their colleagues, 2004 Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information. = Neuromodulation = In addition to fast direct synaptic interactions between neurons forming a network, oscillatory activity is regulated by neuromodulators on a much slower time scale. That is, the concentration levels of certain neurotransmitters are known to regulate the amount of oscillatory activity. For instance, GABA concentration has been shown to be positively correlated with frequency of oscillations in induced stimuli. A number of nuclei in the brainstem have diffuse projections throughout the brain influencing concentration levels of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, acetylcholine and serotonin. These neurotransmitter systems affect the physiological state, e.g., wakefulness or arousal, and have a pronounced effect on amplitude of different brain waves, such as alpha activity.  Mathematical description  Oscillations can often be described and analyzed using mathematics. Mathematicians have identified several dynamical mechanisms that generate rhythmicity. Among the most important are harmonic (linear) oscillators, limit cycle oscillators, and delayed-feedback oscillators. Harmonic oscillations appear very frequently in nature‚Äîexamples are sound waves, the motion of a pendulum, and vibrations of every sort. They generally arise when a physical system is perturbed by a small degree from a minimum-energy state, and are well understood mathematically. Noise-driven harmonic oscillators realistically simulate alpha rhythm in the waking EEG as well as slow waves and spindles in the sleep EEG. Successful EEG analysis algorithms were based on such models. Several other EEG components are better described by limit-cycle or delayed-feedback oscillations. Limit-cycle oscillations arise from physical systems that show large deviations from equilibrium, whereas delayed-feedback oscillations arise when components of a system affect each other after significant time delays. Limit-cycle oscillations can be complex but there are powerful mathematical tools for analyzing them; the mathematics of delayed-feedback oscillations is primitive in comparison. Linear oscillators and limit-cycle oscillators qualitatively differ in terms of how they respond to fluctuations in input. In a linear oscillator, the frequency is more or less constant but the amplitude can vary greatly. In a limit-cycle oscillator, the amplitude tends to be more or less constant but the frequency can vary greatly. A heartbeat is an example of a limit-cycle oscillation in that the frequency of beats varies widely, while each individual beat continues to pump about the same amount of blood. Computational models adopt a variety of abstractions in order to describe complex oscillatory dynamics observed in brain activity. Many models are used in the field, each defined at a different level of abstraction and trying to model different aspects of neural systems. They range from models of the short-term behaviour of individual neurons, through models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons, to models of how behaviour can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems. = Single neuron model = Hindmarsh‚ÄìRose neuron showing typical bursting behavior: a fast rhythm generated by individual spikes and a slower rhythm generated by the bursts. A model of a biological neuron is a mathematical description of the properties of nerve cells, or neurons, that is designed to accurately describe and predict its biological processes. The most successful and widely used model of neurons, the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model, is based on data from the squid giant axon. It is a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of a neuron, in particular the generation and propagation of action potentials. The model is very accurate and detailed and Hodgkin and Huxley received the 1963 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this work. The mathematics of the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model are quite complicated and several simplifications have been proposed, such as the FitzHugh‚ÄìNagumo model, the Hindmarsh‚ÄìRose model or the capacitor-switch model as an extension of the integrate-and-fire model. Such models only capture the basic neuronal dynamics, such as rhythmic spiking and bursting, but are more computationally efficient. This allows the simulation of a large number of interconnected neurons that form a neural network. = Spiking model = A neural network model describes a population of physically interconnected neurons or a group of disparate neurons whose inputs or signalling targets define a recognizable circuit. These models aim to describe how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons. Local interactions between neurons can result in the synchronization of spiking activity and form the basis of oscillatory activity. In particular, models of interacting pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons have been shown to generate brain rhythms such as gamma activity. Similarly, it was shown that simulations of neural networks with a phenomenological model for neuronal response failures can predict spontaneous broadband neural oscillations. = Neural mass model = seizure. As the gain A is increased the network starts to oscillate at 3Hz. Neural field models are another important tool in studying neural oscillations and are a mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity of large numbers of neurons, the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous neural networks. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the mean field approach, an area of statistical physics that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. They have for instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations.Bressloff PC, Cowan JD (2003) Spontaneous pattern formation in primary visual cortex. In: J Hogan, AR Krauskopf, M di Bernado, RE Wilson (Eds.), Nonlinear dynamics and chaos: where do we go from here? = Kuramoto model = Simulation of Kuramoto model showing neural synchronization and oscillations in the mean field The Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators is one of the most abstract and fundamental models used to investigate neural oscillations and synchronization. It captures the activity of a local system (e.g., a single neuron or neural ensemble) by its circular phase alone and hence ignores the amplitude of oscillations (amplitude is constant). Interactions amongst these oscillators are introduced by a simple algebraic form (such as a sine function) and collectively generate a dynamical pattern at the global scale. The Kuramoto model is widely used to study oscillatory brain activity and several extensions have been proposed that increase its neurobiological plausibility, for instance by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity. In particular, it describes how the activity of a group of interacting neurons can become synchronized and generate large-scale oscillations. Simulations using the Kuramoto model with realistic long-range cortical connectivity and time- delayed interactions reveal the emergence of slow patterned fluctuations that reproduce resting-state BOLD functional maps, which can be measured using fMRI.  Activity patterns  Both single neurons and groups of neurons can generate oscillatory activity spontaneously. In addition, they may show oscillatory responses to perceptual input or motor output. Some types of neurons will fire rhythmically in the absence of any synaptic input. Likewise, brain-wide activity reveals oscillatory activity while subjects do not engage in any activity, so-called resting-state activity. These ongoing rhythms can change in different ways in response to perceptual input or motor output. Oscillatory activity may respond by increases or decreases in frequency and amplitude or show a temporary interruption, which is referred to as phase resetting. In addition, external activity may not interact with ongoing activity at all, resulting in an additive response. = Ongoing activity = Spontaneous activity is brain activity in the absence of an explicit task, such as sensory input or motor output, and hence also referred to as resting- state activity. It is opposed to induced activity, i.e. brain activity that is induced by sensory stimuli or motor responses. The term ongoing brain activity is used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for those signal components that are not associated with the processing of a stimulus or the occurrence of specific other events, such as moving a body part, i.e. events that do not form evoked potentials/evoked fields, or induced activity. Spontaneous activity is usually considered to be noise if one is interested in stimulus processing; however, spontaneous activity is considered to play a crucial role during brain development, such as in network formation and synaptogenesis. Spontaneous activity may be informative regarding the current mental state of the person (e.g. wakefulness, alertness) and is often used in sleep research. Certain types of oscillatory activity, such as alpha waves, are part of spontaneous activity. Statistical analysis of power fluctuations of alpha activity reveals a bimodal distribution, i.e. a high- and low- amplitude mode, and hence shows that resting-state activity does not just reflect a noise process. In case of fMRI, spontaneous fluctuations in the blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal reveal correlation patterns that are linked to resting states networks, such as the default network. The temporal evolution of resting state networks is correlated with fluctuations of oscillatory EEG activity in different frequency bands. Ongoing brain activity may also have an important role in perception, as it may interact with activity related to incoming stimuli. Indeed, EEG studies suggest that visual perception is dependent on both the phase and amplitude of cortical oscillations. For instance, the amplitude and phase of alpha activity at the moment of visual stimulation predicts whether a weak stimulus will be perceived by the subject. = Frequency response = In response to input, a neuron or neuronal ensemble may change the frequency at which it oscillates, thus changing the rate at which it spikes. Often, a neuron's firing rate depends on the summed activity it receives. Frequency changes are also commonly observed in central pattern generators and directly relate to the speed of motor activities, such as step frequency in walking. However, changes in relative oscillation frequency between different brain areas is not so common because the frequency of oscillatory activity is often related to the time delays between brain areas. = Amplitude response = Next to evoked activity, neural activity related to stimulus processing may result in induced activity. Induced activity refers to modulation in ongoing brain activity induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation. Hence, they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses. A well-studied type of induced activity is amplitude change in oscillatory activity. For instance, gamma activity often increases during increased mental activity such as during object representation. Because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging, they can only be obtained using time-frequency analysis. Induced activity generally reflects the activity of numerous neurons: amplitude changes in oscillatory activity are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural activity, for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons. Increases in oscillatory activity are therefore often referred to as event-related synchronization, while decreases are referred to as event-related desynchronization. = Phase resetting = Phase resetting occurs when input to a neuron or neuronal ensemble resets the phase of ongoing oscillations. It is very common in single neurons where spike timing is adjusted to neuronal input (a neuron may spike at a fixed delay in response to periodic input, which is referred to as phase locking) and may also occur in neuronal ensembles when the phases of their neurons are adjusted simultaneously. Phase resetting is fundamental for the synchronization of different neurons or different brain regions because the timing of spikes can become phase locked to the activity of other neurons. Phase resetting also permits the study of evoked activity, a term used in electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography for responses in brain activity that are directly related to stimulus-related activity. Evoked potentials and event-related potentials are obtained from an electroencephalogram by stimulus-locked averaging, i.e. averaging different trials at fixed latencies around the presentation of a stimulus. As a consequence, those signal components that are the same in each single measurement are conserved and all others, i.e. ongoing or spontaneous activity, are averaged out. That is, event-related potentials only reflect oscillations in brain activity that are phase-locked to the stimulus or event. Evoked activity is often considered to be independent from ongoing brain activity, although this is an ongoing debate.  Asymmetric amplitude modulation  It has recently been proposed that even if phases are not aligned across trials, induced activity may still cause event-related potentials because ongoing brain oscillations may not be symmetric and thus amplitude modulations may result in a baseline shift that does not average out. This model implies that slow event-related responses, such as asymmetric alpha activity, could result from asymmetric brain oscillation amplitude modulations, such as an asymmetry of the intracellular currents that propagate forward and backward down the dendrites. Under this assumption, asymmetries in the dendritic current would cause asymmetries in oscillatory activity measured by EEG and MEG, since dendritic currents in pyramidal cells are generally thought to generate EEG and MEG signals that can be measured at the scalp.  Function  Neural synchronization can be modulated by task constraints, such as attention, and is thought to play a role in feature binding, neuronal communication, and motor coordination. Neuronal oscillations became a hot topic in neuroscience in the 1990s when the studies of the visual system of the brain by Gray, Singer and others appeared to support the neural binding hypothesis. According to this idea, synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles bind neurons representing different features of an object. For example, when a person looks at a tree, visual cortex neurons representing the tree trunk and those representing the branches of the same tree would oscillate in synchrony to form a single representation of the tree. This phenomenon is best seen in local field potentials which reflect the synchronous activity of local groups of neurons, but has also been shown in EEG and MEG recordings providing increasing evidence for a close relation between synchronous oscillatory activity and a variety of cognitive functions such as perceptual grouping. = Pacemaker = Cells in the sinoatrial node, located in the right atrium of the heart, spontaneously depolarize approximately 100 times per minute. Although all of the heart's cells have the ability to generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction, the sinoatrial node normally initiates it, simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas. Hence, these cells generate the normal sinus rhythm and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the heart rate. In the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the SA node will rhythmically discharge. The sinoatrial node is richly innervated by the autonomic nervous system, which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells. = Central pattern generator = Synchronized firing of neurons also forms the basis of periodic motor commands for rhythmic movements. These rhythmic outputs are produced by a group of interacting neurons that form a network, called a central pattern generator. Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that‚Äîwhen activated‚Äîcan produce rhythmic motor patterns in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information. Examples are walking, breathing, and swimming, Most evidence for central pattern generators comes from lower animals, such as the lamprey, but there is also evidence for spinal central pattern generators in humans. = Information processing = Neuronal spiking is generally considered the basis for information transfer in the brain. For such a transfer, information needs to be coded in a spiking pattern. Different types of coding schemes have been proposed, such as rate coding and temporal coding. Neural oscillations could create periodic time windows in which input spikes have larger effect on neurons, thereby providing a mechanism for decoding temporal codes. = Perception = Synchronization of neuronal firing may serve as a means to group spatially segregated neurons that respond to the same stimulus in order to bind these responses for further joint processing, i.e. to exploit temporal synchrony to encode relations. Purely theoretical formulations of the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis were proposed first, but subsequently extensive experimental evidence has been reported supporting the potential role of synchrony as a relational code. The functional role of synchronized oscillatory activity in the brain was mainly established in experiments performed on awake kittens with multiple electrodes implanted in the visual cortex. These experiments showed that groups of spatially segregated neurons engage in synchronous oscillatory activity when activated by visual stimuli. The frequency of these oscillations was in the range of 40 Hz and differed from the periodic activation induced by the grating, suggesting that the oscillations and their synchronization were due to internal neuronal interactions. Similar findings were shown in parallel by the group of Eckhorn, providing further evidence for the functional role of neural synchronization in feature binding. Since then, numerous studies have replicated these findings and extended them to different modalities such as EEG, providing extensive evidence of the functional role of gamma oscillations in visual perception. Gilles Laurent and colleagues showed that oscillatory synchronization has an important functional role in odor perception. Perceiving different odors leads to different subsets of neurons firing on different sets of oscillatory cycles. These oscillations can be disrupted by GABA blocker picrotoxin, and the disruption of the oscillatory synchronization leads to impairment of behavioral discrimination of chemically similar odorants in bees and to more similar responses across odors in downstream Œ≤-lobe neurons. Recent follow-up of this work has shown that oscillations create periodic integration windows for Kenyon cells in the insect mushroom body, such that incoming spikes from the antennal lobe are more effective in activating Kenyon cells only at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle. Neural oscillations are also thought be involved in the sense of time and in somatosensory perception. However, recent findings argue against a clock-like function of cortical gamma oscillations. = Motor coordination = Oscillations have been commonly reported in the motor system. Pfurtscheller and colleagues found a reduction in alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations in EEG activity when subjects made a movement. Using intra- cortical recordings, similar changes in oscillatory activity were found in the motor cortex when the monkeys performed motor acts that required significant attention. In addition, oscillations at spinal level become synchronised to beta oscillations in the motor cortex during constant muscle activation, as determined by cortico-muscular coherence. Likewise, muscle activity of different muscles reveals inter-muscular coherence at multiple distinct frequencies reflecting the underlying neural circuitry involved in motor coordination. Recently it was found that cortical oscillations propagate as travelling waves across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex. It has been proposed that motor commands in the form of travelling waves can be spatially filtered by the descending fibres to selectively control muscle force. Simulations have shown that ongoing wave activity in cortex can elicit steady muscle force with physiological levels of EEG-EMG coherence. Oscillatory rhythms at 10 Hz have been recorded in a brain area called the inferior olive, which is associated with the cerebellum. These oscillations are also observed in motor output of physiological tremor and when performing slow finger movements. These findings may indicate that the human brain controls continuous movements intermittently. In support, it was shown that these movement discontinuities are directly correlated to oscillatory activity in a cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, which may represent a neural mechanism for the intermittent motor control. = Memory = Neural oscillations, in particular theta activity, are extensively linked to memory function. Theta rhythms are very strong in rodent hippocampi and entorhinal cortex during learning and memory retrieval, and they are believed to be vital to the induction of long-term potentiation, a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory. Coupling between theta and gamma activity is thought to be vital for memory functions, including episodic memory. Tight coordination of single-neuron spikes with local theta oscillations is linked to successful memory formation in humans, as more stereotyped spiking predicts better memory. = Sleep and consciousness = Sleep is a naturally recurring state characterized by reduced or absent consciousness and proceeds in cycles of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Sleep stages are characterized by spectral content of EEG: for instance, stage N1 refers to the transition of the brain from alpha waves (common in the awake state) to theta waves, whereas stage N3 (deep or slow-wave sleep) is characterized by the presence of delta waves. The normal order of sleep stages is N1 ‚Üí N2 ‚Üí N3 ‚Üí N2 ‚Üí REM. = Development = Neural oscillations may play a role in neural development. For example, retinal waves are thought to have properties that define early connectivity of circuits and synapses between cells in the retina.  Pathology  Handwriting of a person affected by Parkinson's disease showing rhythmic tremor activity in the strokes Generalized 3 Hz spike and wave discharges reflecting seizure activity Specific types of neural oscillations may also appear in pathological situations, such as Parkinson's disease or epilepsy. These pathological oscillations often consist of an aberrant version of a normal oscillation. For example, one of the best known types is the spike and wave oscillation, which is typical of generalized or absence epileptic seizures, and which resembles normal sleep spindle oscillations. = Tremor = A tremor is an involuntary, somewhat rhythmic, muscle contraction and relaxation involving to-and-fro movements of one or more body parts. It is the most common of all involuntary movements and can affect the hands, arms, eyes, face, head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. In some people, tremor is a symptom of another neurological disorder. Many different forms of tremor have been identified, such as essential tremor or Parkinsonian tremor. It is argued that tremors are likely to be multifactorial in origin, with contributions from neural oscillations in the central nervous systems, but also from peripheral mechanisms such as reflex loop resonances. = Epilepsy = Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or hypersynchronous neuronal activity in the brain. = Thalamocortical dysrhythmia = In thalamocortical dysrhythmia (TCD), normal thalamocortical resonance is disrupted. The thalamic loss of input allows the frequency of the thalamo- cortical column to slow into the theta or delta band as identified by MEG and EEG by machine learning. TCD can be treated with neurosurgical methods like thalamotomy.  Applications  = Clinical endpoints = Neural oscillations are sensitive to several drugs influencing brain activity; accordingly, biomarkers based on neural oscillations are emerging as secondary endpoints in clinical trials and in quantifying effects in pre-clinical studies. These biomarkers are often named \\"EEG biomarkers\\" or \\"Neurophysiological Biomarkers\\" and are quantified using Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). EEG biomarkers can be extracted from the EEG using the open-source Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox. = Brain‚Äìcomputer interface = Neural oscillation has been applied as a control signal in various brain‚Äìcomputer interfaces (BCIs). For example, a non-invasive BCI can be created by placing electrodes on the scalp and then measuring the weak electric signals. Although individual neuron activities cannot be recorded through non-invasive BCI because the skull damps and blurs the electromagnetic signals, oscillatory activity can still be reliably detected. The BCI was introduced by Vidal in 1973 as challenge of using EEG signals to control objects outside human body. After the BCI challenge, in 1988, alpha rhythm was used in a brain rhythm based BCI for control of a physical object, a robot. Alpha rhythm based BCI was the first BCI for control of a robot. In particular, some forms of BCI allow users to control a device by measuring the amplitude of oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands, including mu and beta rhythms.

In first-class cricket, he represented Yorkshire between 1920 and 1946, scoring over 1,000 runs in 17 consecutive seasons. A left-handed middle-order batsman and occasional left-arm spinner, Leyland was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1929. Born in Harrogate, Leyland came from a cricketing family. After playing locally, he made his Yorkshire debut in 1920, and appeared intermittently in the following two seasons. Although not statistically successful, he impressed judges at the club, and was a regular member of the team from 1923. He steadily improved over the following seasons to reach the fringes of the England team and made his Test debut in 1928 against West Indies. That winter, he toured Australia‚Äîa controversial decision as he replaced the famous batsman Frank Woolley‚Äîand scored a century in his only Test of the series. He remained in the side until 1930, but a loss of form in the next two seasons called his place into question. He recovered by scoring 1,000 runs in August 1932 to secure his inclusion in the team to tour Australia in 1932‚Äì33. During that series, Leyland scored runs several times under pressure and by the time Australia toured England in 1934, he was a leading batsman in the team. He held his place until 1938 when he was replaced in the team by younger batsmen for the series against Australia. Recalled for the final match, he scored 187, his highest Test score in what became his last match. After military service in the Second World War, Leyland returned to the Yorkshire team for one season before announcing his retirement from regular first-class cricket. He maintained his connection with Yorkshire, and served as the county coach between 1950 and 1963. He died in 1967. Although he was neither aesthetically nor technically among the best batsmen, Leyland had a reputation for batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and had it not been for the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries‚Äî\\"chinamen\\". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him. Early life and career Leyland was born on 20 July 1900 in Bilton, an area of Harrogate, to Mercy (n√©e Lambert) and Edward (Ted) Leyland. He was registered at birth as Morris Leyland but his name was usually spelt \\"Maurice\\". His father was a stonemason and a well-respected professional cricketer for Moorside in Lancashire. Leyland senior also acted as Moorside's groundsman, and in later years continued that role at Harrogate, Headingley Cricket Ground and Edgbaston. Leyland junior joined his father in the Moorside team in 1912,Hodgson, p. 115 and by the age of fourteen had graduated to the Lancashire League. After military service in the First World War, he became a professional cricketer for Harrogate between 1918 and 1920. From there he made appearances for the Yorkshire Council, and Yorkshire's second team, for whom he bowled regularly; when he reached the first team, he bowled infrequently in his first seasons. Around this time, he also played football for Harrogate. During the early 1920s, the Yorkshire committee was attempting to find players to replace those whose careers had ended with the First World War. Late in the 1920 season, Leyland made his first-class debut for Yorkshire, having played several times in the second team that summer. He played once, against Essex, scoring ten runs in his only innings, but this was his sole appearance that year. He had never previously attended a County Championship game. The following year, Leyland played in five first-team matches, scoring 52 not out against Leicestershire, averaging just over 19 for the season. In the latter part of the 1922 season he played more regularly, replacing Norman Kilner in the team. Although Leyland's batting figures were unimpressive, the summary of Yorkshire's season in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack said he \\"gave signs of promise as a forcing batsman and fielded very finely\\". His highest score in 14 matches was 29, but he was awarded his county cap, and critics within Yorkshire judged him to have great potential. Established county cricketer Leyland played regularly in the 1923 season and reached 1,000 runs in first- class cricket, a total he exceeded in each of the seventeen seasons between 1923 and the outbreak of war in 1939. In 1923, he scored seven fifties and averaged 27.89; Wisden suggested that he would become a leading left-handed batsman and that \\"his future seems assured\\". In his history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Anthony Woodhouse states that Leyland gained valuable experience as part of a successful batting side.Woodhouse (1989), p. 326. During this period, Yorkshire won the County Championship in four successive seasons from 1922 to 1925. A later review of Leyland's career in Wisden suggested that this team was one of Yorkshire's strongest, but sometimes became over-competitive and aggressive. The review stated that this environment \\"was a hard school for a young cricketer, but Leyland thrived on such discipline, and he has never lost his laugh.\\" By the beginning of the 1924 season, Leyland was recognised in The Times as one of the most promising young professional batsmen in England; the newspaper's cricket correspondent noted that Leyland \\"is fully expected, in Yorkshire, to develop into a first- rate left-handed batsman.\\" He continued to improve that season,Woodhouse (1989), pp. 332‚Äì33. scoring 1,259 runs at 30.70. In August, he scored his first century in first-class cricket, hitting 133 not out in a drawn game against Lancashire; later in the month, he scored another century. Leyland further improved his record in 1925, hitting 1,572 runs at 40.30. Wisden commented: \\"Leyland still further increased the big reputation he had made in the previous summer and ought, if all goes well with him, to attain the highest distinction.\\" By the end of the 1926 season, in which he scored 1,561 runs at 39.02 and hit five centuries, Leyland had established himself as one of the most reliable batsmen in the Yorkshire team. Following the example of Wilfred Rhodes, several Yorkshire cricketers in the 1920s spent English winters coaching in India for the Maharaja of Patiala. Leyland coached in the winter of 1926‚Äì27, along with Arthur Dolphin, the Yorkshire wicketkeeper. That same winter, a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team toured India; although not chosen in the touring party, both Leyland and Dolphin played a handful of matches for the MCC. During the 1927 season Leyland scored 1,625 runs at 41.66, and, against Middlesex, scored his first double-century. Wisden suggested that he \\"was not so dependable as could have been desired\\", but batted in an entertaining fashion. In August, he was selected in a trial game to assess players who might represent England in Test matches‚Äîhe played against the England team for a side named \\"The Rest\\"‚Äîand scored 102. In the winter of 1927‚Äì28, Leyland once more coached in India for the Maharajah of Patiala. Shortly after returning from India, Leyland married Constance (Connie) Russell in Harrogate on 29 March 1928. In later years, Connie looked after the children of Herbert Sutcliffe during Yorkshire matches at Harrogate when their behaviour became too much for their own mother. Sutcliffe's daughter later recalled Connie as \\"very stern and cross\\", and the only person who could control her and her brother: \\"I was frightened to death.\\"Hill, p. 82. Test match cricketer =Test debut and selection for Australian tour= The death of alt=A cricketer wearing a blazer Like Leyland, the Yorkshire bowler Roy Kilner coached in India during 1927‚Äì28. However, in doing so Kilner contracted a fever and died shortly after returning to England. With a weakened bowling attack, and affected by injuries and loss of form, Yorkshire pressed Leyland into service as an occasional bowler in the 1928 season. He had done little bowling for Yorkshire at this point; the team possessed two slow left-arm spinners in Kilner and Rhodes, leaving Leyland with little opportunity. Having never bowled 50 first-class overs in a previous season, nor taken more than four wickets, he bowled over 500 overs in 1928 and took 35 wickets at an average of 34.20. At this stage, the Yorkshire authorities thought that he might fully take on Kilner's bowling workload, or succeed Rhodes in the senior spinner's position.Gibson, p. 141. Leyland also had his most effective season with the bat. He scored 1,783 runs at an average of 54.03, and scored another double century. At the end of the season, Wisden commented: \\"[Leyland] can play both the games‚Äîthe dogged defence when a bad position must be saved and a fine forcing game when it is necessary to make runs quickly. In the ordinary way his preference is for attack and he is a delightful batsman to watch.\\" During June 1928, Leyland was selected for another Test trial, playing for \\"The Rest\\" against England; then in mid-July he played for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground. At the end of July, the MCC named the team to tour Australia for the 1928‚Äì29 Ashes series. Leyland was included in the team; according to The Times, it would have been difficult to leave him out and his presence lifted the fielding ability of the side. His selection was controversial in the south of England, and particularly in Kent, as he took the place that the veteran Kent batsman Frank Woolley was expected to fill.Gibson, pp. 141‚Äì42. One Kent supporter wrote that Leyland was a \\"cross bat village-greener\\".Lemmon, p. 75. Pelham Warner, a selector at the time, claimed that Leyland's superior fielding influenced the decision, but the cricket writer Alan Gibson suggests that the real choice was between Woolley and Phil Mead, two batsmen of similar age.Gibson, p. 142. In 1928, the West Indies toured England, playing their first Test matches. The team did not perform well, but the England selectors picked strong teams to provide practice for the players. Leyland was selected for the last of the three Test matches. Making his debut on 11 August 1928, he was dismissed for 0 by Herman Griffith in his only innings. The MCC team which toured Australia was extremely strong in batting, and Leyland served as back- up to the main batsmen.Douglas, p. 64. The English batting line-up was settled for most of the series, leaving little opportunity for the reserves; although Mead played in the first Test, he was subsequently left out to strengthen the bowling.Lemmon, pp. 79, 83. Playing in other first-class matches on the tour, Leyland scored centuries against South Australia and Queensland. With England 4‚Äì0 ahead in the series, Chapman stood down from the final Test; although it is not clear why he did so, one possibility is that he wished to give as many members of the team as possible a chance to appear in the Tests. Alternatively, he may have felt that his batting form did not warrant a place in the team. Whatever the reason, Leyland took his place.Lemmon, pp. 90‚Äì92.Douglas, p. 83. England lost the match, but Leyland was successful. He scored 137, his first Test century, and 53 not out. The report in Wisden said that he \\"distinguished himself by two really delightful displays ... His exhibition of powerful, well-timed driving past cover-point will long be remembered by those who saw it.\\" Overall, in first-class matches on the tour, he scored 614 runs at 43.85, but his bowling was ineffective on the hard pitches. Following his success in the last Test, Leyland was expected to become one of the leading English batsmen, and before the 1929 season he was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his performances in the 1928 season. =Test regular= Leyland scored 1,931 runs at 42.91 in 1929, and took 50 first-class wickets in the season at an average of 30.26. In the match against Oxford University he took eight wickets and against Glamorgan he took five wickets in an innings for the first time in his career. Against Lancashire, in a match which Rhodes missed with injury, Leyland took the role of the main spinner and returned figures of seven wickets for 52 runs. After watching this performance, the cricket writer Neville Cardus judged that Leyland had bowled well and with spirit on a wet pitch which favoured spin bowling, but that he lacked the accuracy and flight required in left-arm spin bowlers and exemplified by Rhodes.Cardus (1982), pp. 272‚Äì76. In another game, Cardus observed that Leyland seemed to be attempting left-handed googly bowling.Hodgson, p. 127.Cardus (1982), p. 263. Following success in a trial game, Leyland kept his place in the Test team, playing all five matches against South Africa that summer to score 294 runs at an average of 42.00. In the Second Test, played at Lord's, he scored 73 and 102. Leyland did not play in the first two matches of the 1930 Ashes series; Woolley replaced him in the team but was unsuccessful and Leyland came in for the final three games.Gibson, p. 143. Leyland was little more effective, and his highest score in the series was 44; England lost 2‚Äì1. More successful for Yorkshire, he scored five centuries for the county, and hit his highest score of the season against Lancashire‚Äîthe eventual County Champions for 1930. At the time, Yorkshire v Lancashire matches were mainly dour, slow-scoring affairs, but Leyland played freely to score 211 not out in around 270 minutes. He hit two sixes in one over,Cardus (1982), pp. 284‚Äì86, 290. and, according to Cardus, played \\"great and beautiful cricket\\".Cardus (1982), p. 286. Leyland's best bowling performance that year came for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's, when he took seven for 94 in the first innings and nine wickets in the match. In all first-class matches in 1930, he scored 2,175 runs at an average of 50.58, the first time he reached 2,000 runs in a season, and took 53 wickets at 27.92. During the 1930‚Äì31 English winter, he toured South Africa with an MCC team. Owing to the absence of a regular opening batsman, Leyland opened the batting on several occasions and performed consistently during the tour. In first-class matches, he scored 774 runs at 36.85 and took nine wickets; in the Test series, he scored 300 runs at 42.85, twice passing fifty. In the second game, he took three for 91, his best bowling performance in Test matches. =Bodyline tour= Leyland struggled in the following two seasons. In 1931, he scored just one century as his aggregate and average‚Äî1,228 runs at 38.37‚Äîboth fell, although his increasing habit of succeeding against the best opposition continued when he scored 96 for Yorkshire against the Rest of England. With the ball, he took 12 wickets at an average over 40. Despite his loss of form, Yorkshire won the County Championship for the first time since 1925; the team were also champions in the next two seasons and went on to win seven out of nine championships before the Second World War. Leyland played for the Players against the Gentlemen, but was not selected for any of the Tests in the three-match series between England and New Zealand. Wisden later suggested that he was \\"stale\\"; at the time, in reviewing candidates to tour Australia in 1932‚Äì33, the Wisden editor believed that \\"no reason exists why Leyland should not regain his best form\\". alt=A cricket team arranged in three rows. Seventeen men are dressed as players, the other three men are in suits. At the beginning of the 1932 season, Leyland continued to struggle. Although he was chosen in two Test trial matches and scored 189 against Middlesex, he was left out of the England team for the only Test of the summer, and had little success in the first three months of the season. However, in August he made 1,013 runs at 84.14, scoring four centuries and two innings over 90. During this spell, Leyland shared a partnership of 149 runs in 55 minutes with Herbert Sutcliffe against Essex. That county had chosen two fast bowlers in an attempt to intimidate the Yorkshire batsmen. Ken Farnes and Morris Nichols bowled a succession of bouncers; Farnes attempted fast leg theory bowling, a tactic which developed into Bodyline during the MCC tour of Australia in 1932‚Äì33.Frith, p. 49. Eventually, Sutcliffe began to hook the short ball and in six successive overs, he and Leyland added 102 runs, an unusually fast rate of scoring. Leyland faced little of the bowling, later remembering that he received only four deliveries in this period, hitting each for four. In total, he contributed only 45 runs to the partnership.Hill, p. 136. Farnes was reduced to tears by the assault on his bowling,Hill, p. 137. and these events possibly persuaded the MCC selectors to leave him out of the team for the 1932‚Äì33 tour. Leyland, on the other hand, was among the last names added to the touring party in mid-August. At the end of the season, he scored 105 against the Rest of England for Yorkshire, his team playing as County Champions. In total, he scored 1,980 runs at 52.10 and took 23 wickets at 20.86. England won the 1932‚Äì33 Ashes series 4‚Äì1, but the cricket was overshadowed by controversy over the team's use of Bodyline tactics. Leyland was not particularly successful in statistical terms. However, assessing the tour in Wisden, Sydney Southerton wrote that Leyland \\"fared on the whole extremely well ... he had batted finely in the Test matches at Adelaide and Brisbane\\". He scored 306 runs in the five Test matches at an average of 34.00; he began and ended the series with scores of 0, but played innings of 83 and 86 in the decisive third and fourth Test matches, with his team under pressure when he batted. Gibson points out that both of his ducks came when England were in dominant positions. In all first-class matches on the tour, Leyland scored 880 runs at 44.00, including two centuries against state teams. The former Australian batsmen Charlie Macartney suggested that, although \\"a useful player\\", Leyland was hindered by his defensive approach. Going against his naturally aggressive approach made him seem \\"awkward\\", and never allowed him to play at his best. Other Australian commentators had a more favourable opinion. =Peak years= Returning from Australia, Leyland scored 2,317 first-class runs in the 1933 season, the highest seasonal aggregate of his career. Averaging 50.36, he scored seven centuries. With the ball, he took 37 wickets at 28.13. In a game against Leicestershire in August, he took ten wickets for 94 runs, the only time in his career he took ten wickets in a match. The West Indies team toured England that season, but Leyland played only in the first Test; he scored one run in his single innings. Leyland also scored over 2,000 first-class runs in 1934, at an average of 53.55. Playing all five Test matches of the series against the touring Australian team, he scored 478 runs at an average of 68.28. His three centuries were scored when England were in difficult situations. A Wisden review of his career written in 1943 stated: \\"In 1934 Leyland reached the height of his powers. Ripe in technique, rich in experience, like granite in battle, he was in this season England's greatest batsman.\\" England lost the series 2‚Äì1. The Australians were heavily dependent on the bowling of Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly. At the time, O'Reilly was regarded as the best bowler in the world, and among the greatest of all time, but Leyland began a spell of relative dominance over him.Cardus (1979), p. 129. In the second Test, Leyland scored 109 and shared a partnership of 129 with Les Ames; in the next match, he hit 153 runs, sharing large partnerships with Patsy Hendren and Ames, and in the final Test, he played an innings of 110. However, the rest of the England batting was unreliable; reviewing the season, the Wisden editor Sydney Southerton wrote: \\"In nearly every match either Hendren, Leyland or Ames, instead of being able to go in and play a free, confident game, had to save or remedy a position seriously damaged by the quick fall of two or three wickets.\\" In addition to his batting successes, Leyland was generally the best outfielder in the England team. He also scored three centuries for Yorkshire, another for the Rest of England against Lancashire, the Champion County, and 80 for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. With the ball, he took 33 first-class wickets. He was given a benefit match against Nottinghamshire; his benefit eventually raised ¬£3,648, at the time the third highest amount raised for a Yorkshire player.Hodgson, p. 251. During the winter of 1934‚Äì35, Leyland toured the West Indies with an MCC team which lost the four-Test series 2‚Äì1. The English batsmen were overwhelmed by the pace bowlers of the West Indies team, and some MCC players complained that Learie Constantine, Manny Martindale and Leslie Hylton intimidated the visiting batsmen with short-pitched bowling. Leyland played three Tests but scored only 36 runs in six innings. More successful in other first-class games, he scored 347 runs at 21.68 overall, and took 11 wickets. He scored 1,815 runs at an average of 38.61 in 1935 and took 32 wickets at 25.46. He played in four of the five Tests against South Africa‚Äîhe missed the third with lumbago‚Äîto score 342 runs at 57.00. In the first and fourth Tests, he hit fifties, and in the final match scored 161 runs in 130 minutes, batting quickly throughout. However, England could not force a win, and having lost the second Test, were beaten 1‚Äì0 in the series. After taking part in a tour of Jamaica by the Yorkshire team, on which he scored 115 and 75 in successive games, Leyland scored 1,790 runs at 45.89 in 1936. He hit seven centuries, including an innings of 263 runs against Essex in the season, the highest first-class score of his career. He played in two of the three Tests against India that season‚Äîhe missed the second with injury‚Äîbut only batted twice. In the first Test, he scored 60 runs against a strong bowling attack when England were in a difficult position. The home side won the series 2‚Äì0. During the season, Leyland was among the first players chosen to tour Australia with the MCC in the forthcoming winter. The MCC team was captained by G. O. B. Allen who added Leyland to the team selection committee during the tour. The team won the first two Tests, but lost the next three to lose the series 3‚Äì2, and Wisden blamed a weakness in batting for the defeat. Leyland was one of the few batsmen excused: \\"Leyland, though very restrained, was one of the mainstays of the batting\\". Before the series, England were expected to struggle severely against the bowling of O'Reilly. According to Cardus, Leyland told O'Reilly before the first Test: \\"Ah can tell thi one thing now for certain ... Ah's got thee where Ah wants thi, Bill‚Äîand Ah thinks tha knows it.\\" In the first Test, Leyland scored 126 after the team lost the first three wickets for 20 runs; many critics judged this to be his greatest innings.Gibson, p. 144. At this point, he had scored four centuries in seven Test innings against Australia. He played an effective defensive innings in the second innings, and another in the second Test, when he was criticised for slow scoring. Then in the third Test, on a pitch made exceptionally difficult for batsmen by rain, England could only score 76 for nine; Leyland scored 17 of those runs and according to Wisden, \\"was the one real success for England ... [He] never seemed in difficulties\\". In the second innings, he scored a century In total, in five Test matches, he scored 441 runs at an average of 55.12. Australian critics viewed Leyland as one of England's best batsmen, and gave him credit for England's strong showing early in the series. In all first-class games on the tour, he scored 902 runs at 50.11; he was unsuccessful in three games the team played in New Zealand on completion of the main tour. =Last years as a cricketer= Leyland missed a substantial amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, barely playing in July, and missing the Test series against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 runs at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Injuries continued to trouble him in 1938. He scored 1,884 first-class runs at 43.81, but a shoulder strain early in the season adversely affected his form. He was not selected for the first three Tests against Australia, not least as the England side contained several promising batsmen. However, he had his best season with the ball. A succession of hard, dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32.Gibson, p. 145. Early in the season, he took eight for 63 against Hampshire, the best figures of his career. Just as his batting form returned, and when he was likely to be recalled to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. However, he recovered in time to play in the final Test of the series. Australia's victory in the fourth Test had given the team a 1‚Äì0 lead. Wisden commented: \\"The inclusion once again of Leyland was a move which yielded splendid results.\\" Coming in to bat at number three, Leyland shared a partnership of 382 with Len Hutton, at the time a record English Test partnership for any wicket; it is still England's highest partnership for the second wicket, and the highest for any wicket against Australia. As there was no time limit on the match, Leyland batted very cautiously and scored 187 in around six-and-a-half hours before he was run out. Hutton went on to score 364, at the time the highest score in Tests. England had batted deliberately slowly to frustrate the bowlers, and Cardus expressed his frustration to Leyland during an interval in play. Cardus wrote: \\"'And even you, Maurice,' I complained, in sorrow not anger, 'even you won't hit the ball and give us some cricket.' 'Hey, wait a minute, Mr Cardus,' expostulated Leyland, as though pained at my protest, 'wait a minute‚Äîtha must remember that Ah'm playing for me place in team. England went on to win the match and level the series. Leyland's innings was his highest in Tests, but this was his final match for England. In 41 Tests, he scored 2,764 runs at 46.06 and took six wickets. In 1939, the last season before the Second World War, Leyland scored 1,238 runs at 39.93 and took 23 wickets. He served in the army during the war: first as a sergeant instructor, and was later commissioned as lieutenant. Between his army duties, he played cricket in the Bradford League, and played for various wartime teams, including ones representing the army. In 1945, he played some non-first-class games for teams representing Yorkshire and a first-class game for Yorkshire against Lancashire. Choosing to continue his career after the war to help the Yorkshire team become re-established, Leyland played a last full season in 1946 when he scored 632 runs at 21.06, with a highest score of 88, and took 16 wickets at 14.70; against Warwickshire, he took seven for 36. During August 1946, he announced his retirement, but in the following two seasons, he appeared in some end-of-season first-class games. He ended his first-class career in 1948 with 33,660 runs at 40.50 and 466 wickets at 29.31. Later life After his retirement from the Yorkshire team, Leyland returned to play for Harrogate until 1950,Woodhouse (1989), p. 317. when he became chief coach, along with Arthur Mitchell, at Yorkshire.Thomson, p. 129.GIbson, p. 146. Mitchell was a dour, serious man but the contrast with the cheerier Leyland made an effective partnership. Leyland also served as a representative of the paper manufacturers Thomas Owen.Hill, p. 186. In 1949, he was among the first group of former professional cricketers to be awarded honorary membership of the MCC. He continued as a respected coach of Yorkshire until illness forced his retirement in 1963. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he maintained some connections with Yorkshire cricket and always tried to attend matches played at Harrogate. In recognition of his achievements, the Harrogate grounds erected new gates which were named in his honour. Leyland died in a hospital at Knaresborough on 1 January 1967. Style, technique and personality alt=A left-handed cricketer hitting the ball As a batsman, Leyland generally batted in the middle order or occasionally opened the batting. Early in his career, commentators suggested that his batting technique was faulty, even when he was statistically successful. His use of the cut shot was mistrusted by some Yorkshire critics, and they suspected that his preference for attacking play would be unsuccessful; he was a faster scorer and more aggressive batsman than most of his Yorkshire contemporaries. Cardus suggested that, instead, he was in the line of \\"humorous Yorkshiremen which the broad nature of his county produces from time to time as a contrast to and leavening of the generally dour lump. There was a twinkle in his eye and there was a twinkle in his bat, no matter how grimly and straight it may occasionally be obliged to defend a difficult situation in Yorkshire.\\" The cricket writer E. W. Swanton observed that Leyland's bat was often not straight when he played his shots‚Äîcontrary to orthodox technique‚Äîbut the speed of his footwork and his ability to watch the ball closely made up for any lapses.Swanton, p. 38. Opposing bowlers suggested that the impression was an illusion and that his bat was straight when he hit the ball. Although Leyland was not a stylish batsman, he was effective. Cardus described him as \\"a sturdy cricketer, not tall, but his sloping bottle-neck shoulders seemed to add inches to him and he had long arms of impressive thickness, veined with strength at the wrist; also he was broad in the beam, with a rubicund smile on his cheerful open countenance.\\"Cardus (1979), p. 130. He was a good driver of the ball, with a high backlift, and moved quickly and economically to reach the pitch of the ball. Cardus thought that his style of batting was representative of his character: \\"He put his nature into every stroke, and as soon as he had 'got bowling where he wanted it,' he didn't merely hit or drive it‚Äîhe walloped it.\\"Cardus (1979), p. 131. At times, Leyland's desire to score quickly brought about his dismissal. However, when necessary, he defended strongly and used his pads as a second line of defence if he missed the ball with his bat. Critics judged Leyland a better Test than county batsman.Swanton, p. 39. His first-class batting figures were not exceptional compared to other cricketers who played far fewer Test matches,Gibson, pp. 140‚Äì41. but in Tests, his average is six runs an innings higher; against Australia, the strongest of England's opponents during his career, he averaged 56, a further increase of ten runs. Gibson suggests that he rose to the big occasions, and that he performed best against the toughest opponents. According to Leyland's obituary in The Times, \\"He was essentially a man for the big occasion, a batsman at his best in a crisis, and his favourite game was a Roses match or an Australian Test. England's supporters often breathed a sigh of relief to see his burly figure purposefully striding to the wicket.\\" The writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that Leyland in a Test match was like the \\"four-squarers of ancient or romantic times. He was Horatius on the tottering bridge; Hector, who alone stood between Troy and destruction. He was born to rescue. But he is more dangerous than those who are stubborn or grim. He has something of D'Artagnan in him; there is a gaiety besides the simplicity and strength; seen in the slight list of the cap, and in a certain jauntiness and optimism of gait.\\"Robertson-Glasgow, p. 19. Although he did not have to face top-class fast bowling in Test matches, he was successful against English fast bowlers such as Harold Larwood in county cricket, and he established his ascendancy over O'Reilly, the world's best bowler at the time.Cardus (1979), pp. 132‚Äì33. On one occasion, O'Reilly held his head in his hands when he saw Leyland come out to bat, and was heard to say: \\"Oh, it's that bloody Yorkshireman again!\\" In later years, O'Reilly vigorously denied that Leyland held the upper hand, responding to such suggestions by saying \\"You just check how many times I got him out!\\"Frith, p. 156. The cricket historian David Frith points out that \\"the answer is nine times in 16 Tests, but with decreasing frequency. In their Test encounters Leyland made 1,412 runs at an average of 56.\\" Robertson-Glasgow noted that Leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure; he came to life in more difficult circumstances: \\"His element was foul weather. He would disappear into the haze of Bramall Lane, where a sterner sort of game was being played under the name of cricket, and entrench himself among the sawdust and smoke and off-breaks and appeals, and do his raw, tough work in silence.\\" Leyland was regarded by critics as a good fielder in almost any position. He bowled left-arm spin, but contrary to the orthodox practice for a left-arm spinner to use his fingers to spin the ball, usually bowled the ball from the back of his hand‚Äîthe delivery known as slow left-arm wrist-spin. He did not take bowling seriously, but enjoyed it. In this role, he was effective at times, but other players were used in the main spinner's role for Yorkshire in preference to him, and he was generally used as back-up, for example when the other bowlers had failed to dismiss well-set batsmen. His Wisden obituary suggests that, had he played for another county, he might have developed into a world-class all-rounder. His lack of opportunity prompted him to experiment with wrist spin, and he later claimed that he originated the term \\"chinaman\\" to describe the delivery. Wisden suggests: \\"Whenever two batsmen were difficult to shift or something different was wanted someone in the Yorkshire team would say, 'Put on Maurice to bowl some of those Chinese things.' Roy Kilner explained, 'It's foreign stuff and you can't call it anything else. Another version was the Leyland believed that the particular delivery was only good enough \\"to get the Chinese out\\". However, there are several theories over how the delivery came to be named. Leyland was noted as a humorist in his playing days; many stories are associated with him, although some are probably apocryphal. He told stories against himself. One story concerned his dismissal during a wartime match, in which he was out to a terrible delivery from a bowler who was badly out of practice. Leyland hit the ball in the air and was caught. He ruefully commented: \\"You know, I don't get much practice against that stuff\\". Another time, he described how he faced an over from O'Reilly, as related in his obituary in The Cricketer: \\"'First he bowled me an off-break, then he bowled me a leg-break; then his googly, then a bumper, then one that went with his arm ...' 'But that's only five, Maurice. What about the last one?' 'Oh, that,' said Maurice deprecatingly. 'That was a straight 'un and it bowled me. Among his team-mates, Leyland was known as \\"Tonnip\\", or \\"Turnip\\", possibly a reference to his country upbringing. Robertson-Glasgow and Cardus wrote prolifically on Leyland; Gibson suggests that these pieces are among their best work. Leyland was popular with team- mates, opponents and spectators around the world. Swanton concluded his obituary of Leyland: \\"No more courageous or determined cricketer ever buckled on pads for England.\\" Notes References =Footnotes= =Bibliography=    1900 births 1967 deaths Cricketers from Harrogate English cricketers England Test cricketers English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Yorkshire cricketers Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Patiala cricketers Players cricketers North v South cricketers Wisden Cricketers of the Year H.
