The town is the historic site of the Isca Augusta Roman Fortress.  History   Roman Era  Caerleon has been settled since 75 AD on the arrival of the Roman legion which established their port and outpost. The town has a number of well preserved Roman sites including Caerleon Amphitheatre, military bath houses, Field Barracks, and the fortress wall, which is 12 feet (3.7m) high. The site has been linked as a burial place of King Arthur, with Nennius' 830 AD work Historia Brittonum referring to 'The City Of The Legion', a city some believe is Caerleon. The Castle of Caerleon is believed to have been established on the site between 1067 and 1075 during the Anglo-Norman advance from Chepstow to the west.  Chartism and 19th century expansion  Land in the area would have consisted of Roman and Medieval stone ruins until the 19th Century, when stone was moved and soil filled on the site to construct walls for the present day Mynde. The present site was formed in 1839 to protect the then owner, local industrialist John Jenkins, from the Chartist protesters fighting for universal suffrage in Newport. At the time it is believed that extensive remains of a Roman villa were uncovered.  Present day  The site is a special interest site registered by the Welsh conservation body Cadw, and the walls surrounding the land are a Grade II listed structure.

Early life and education Born in 1936 in Tunis, Fatma Chamakh-Haddad came from a family of Muslim and nationalist intellectuals. She was educated as a child in Tunis, notably in the Russian high school. As a teenager, she became a member of the Neo Destour (the New Constitutional Liberal Party) and the General Union of Tunisian Students (UGET). She then went to university in Paris, where she joined her brothers. In 1955, she began studying philosophy, anthropology, and English language and civilization at the Sorbonne University in Paris. In 1961, she was accepted into the competition of agr√©gation of philosophy. She later got her PhD by presenting in 1977, in Paris, a thesis titled Philosophie syst√©matique et syst√®me de philosophie politique chez Spinoza [Systematic Philosophy and System of Political Philosophy by Spinoza], developed under the direction of Paul Ric≈ìur (the thesis was published in Tunis in 1980). During her studies in Paris, she became vice-president of the UGET and a member of the local group of N√©o Destour.  Career  After her agr√©gation, Chamakh-Haddad returned to Tunisia. She taught first in secondary education and at the National School of Assistant Professors before joining Tunis University in 1967. She was assistant from 1967 to 1968, master assistant from 1968 to 1977, master lecturer from 1977 to 1982, professor of higher education in the history of modern philosophy at the Department of Philosophy in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities of Tunis in 1982, then professor emeritus. Chamakh-Haddad worked and published on human rights and women's rights, on political philosophy, as well as in the field of bioethics (particularly interested in the issues of suffering and pain) as a member of the Tunisian National Committee for Medical Ethics. As a specialist on Baruch Spinoza, she held in particular the separation of the political and theological, and a method to analyse the problems of modern civilization, as well as the Arab-Muslim world. From 1966, she also became a member of the central committee of the National Union of Tunisian Women (UNFT). She then participated in the work of the Center for Research, Studies, Documentation and Information on Women and the Association of Tunisian Women for Development Research (AFTURD), organizations related to the cause of women. The UNFT was close to the institutions of power and represented at the time what has been called a \\"state feminism\\" put forward by the government (the Socialist Destourian Party) of Tunisia, the AFTURD being more independent of government control. Chamakh-Haddad participated and lead seminars and academic symposia on the theme of the cause of women. Taking advantage of the interest of the Tunisian rulers for this subject, she participated in the creation, at the Higher Institute of Human Sciences of Tunis (the Ibn Charaf Institute), of a professional master of women's studies, a new initiative within the Tunisian university. It is to this master's degree that she devoted the last years of her academic activity. She died on May 2, 2013.

She also held the position of First Lady from 1979 to 1992 during her husband's first presidential tenure. Biography Sassou Nguesso was born Antoinette Loemba Tchibota on May 7, 1945, in Brazzaville to Pascal Loemba Tchibota and Marie-Louise Djembo. Her parents, who were originally from Kakamo√©ka, divorced when she was a child. Her mother later remarried to her second husband, Fran√ßois Gallo Poto, a cousin of the Antoinette Gbetigbia Gogbe Yetene (d. 1977), first wife of Mobutu Sese Seko, the President of Zaire. Sassou Nguesso's mother, who became known as Mama Poto Galo, died in January 2005 and was buried in Gombe Cemetery in Kinshasa in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. Following her parent's divorce, Sassou Nguesso was raised in both Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville. She attended elementary school in both cities, before enrolling in a girl's college in Mouyondzi. Sassou Nguesso is a retired teacher. Sassou Nguesso has been president of a Congolese NGO, the Congo Assistance Foundation (la Fondation Congo Assistance), since its establishment on May 7, 1984. The first lady routinely travels with her personal hairdresser, the Brazzaville-based stylist Am√©d√©e Ebono, on all official trips. In June 2016, Sassou Nguesso was subpoenaed to appear in an American court while traveling in Washington D.C. The case stems from an ongoing 1980 debt dispute between the American company Commisimpex and the Congolese government under President Denis Sassou Nguesso. The company maintains that it was never compensated for its work by the Sassou Nguesso government. First Lady Sassou Nguesso was summoned to the U.S. court to answer questions regarding her family's assets, as well as government finances. Antoinette Sassou Nguesso ignored the subpoena and did not appear in court. Sassou Nguesso's family remains the subject of several legal and financial investigations in the U.S. and France. The French Ministry of Justice seized a real estate complex located in the 17th arrondissement of Paris which had been purchased in Antoinette Sassou Nguesso's name.

In graph theory, a subfield of mathematics, a well-colored graph is an undirected graph for which greedy coloring uses the same number of colors regardless of the order in which colors are chosen for its vertices. That is, for these graphs, the chromatic number (minimum number of colors) and Grundy number (maximum number of greedily-chosen colors) are equal. Examples The well- colored graphs include the complete graphs and odd-length cycle graphs (the graphs that form the exceptional cases to Brooks' theorem) as well as the complete bipartite graphs and complete multipartite graphs. The simplest example of a graph that is not well-colored is a four-vertex path. Coloring the vertices in path order uses two colors, the optimum for this graph. However, coloring the ends of the path first (using the same color for each end) causes the greedy coloring algorithm to use three colors for this graph. Because there exists a non-optimal vertex ordering, the path is not well- colored. Complexity A graph is well-colored if and only if does not have two vertex orderings for which the greedy coloring algorithm produces different numbers of colors. Therefore, recognizing non-well-colored graphs can be performed within the complexity class NP. On the other hand, a graph G has Grundy number k or more if and only if the graph obtained from G by adding a (k-1)-vertex clique is well-colored. Therefore, by a reduction from the Grundy number problem, it is NP-complete to test whether these two orderings exist. It follows that it is co-NP-complete to test whether a given graph is well-colored. Related properties A graph is hereditarily well-colored if every induced subgraph is well-colored. The hereditarily well-colored graphs are exactly the cographs, the graphs that do not have a four-vertex path as an induced subgraph.

It is held in July, setting up over a week period, with a main weekend hosting the headline events. The 2019 festival concluded on 13 and 14 July.  History  The festival was founded in 2003 by Dr Russell Rhys, a local GP. Born in Llanelli, he was part of the Welsh √©migr√©s in London and was a friend of Dylan Thomas. He later joined Gwent County Council and befriended the late Newport West MP Paul Flynn. Dr Rhys resided at the Mynde, and later went on to acquire the site for the now-Ffwrrm opposite his home. The Ffwrrm today is a garden square with small businesses and artists, with the garden decorated in some of the works produced by the Arts Festival.  Establishment  Dr Rhys acquired old stables and buildings on the site of the present Ffwrwm arts centre. The site remains a cultural centre today, set in 18th century gardens. The site includes a Celtic Arts & Crafts store, sculpture garden, independent restaurant, and a number of small businesses. In 2003 he started the Festival, inspired by Hay-on-Wye, and he was responsible for commissioning the sculptural works. Wood workers were invited from as far as China, expenses paid, but required to preserve their work in the village. Today Caerleon and the nearby area are surrounded by mythical-styled wood sculptures, depicting such ideas as Arthurian knights of the Round Table or Welsh Mabinogion. Today there are over 100 works, many by Welsh artist Ed Harrison.  Modern day  The present day festival continues the tradition of arts, crafts, and sculpture set by Dr Rhys, but now expands to include music, literature, dance and entertainment. It regularly invites musicians from other countries to perform. The festival has expanded to venues along the River Usk, with music and performances at the Hanbury Arms on the riverfront, as well as at the 17th century Bell Inn and the Festival Field. The 2019 organisers have made a particular focus on musical diversity, with an offering of folk, jazz, blues, rock and roll, and Middle Eastern dance. The Literature on the Lawn festival is the 'fringe' literary festival, held in the garden of the Priory Hotel. It offers literary discussions, readings, and entertainment, hosted around 5-8 July each year prior to the arts festival.  Supporters  The event is supported by the local Caerleon Festival charity and its members, as well as a wide range of local businesses, including Literature Wales, ABP, Cadw, Sainsbury's, The Celtic Manor Resort, Brains Brewery, and Welsh Government.

Early life  Albertine Randall was born May 27, 1863, in San Francisco, CA. A 1921 article in the American Magazine of Art lists San Francisco's Chinatown as a particular influence on her artistic development. In 1887, she married businessman Fairfax Henry Wheelan, with whom she had two children, Edgar Stow Wheelan and Fairfax Randall Wheelan. After her husband's death in 1915, she moved to New York City.  Career  Wheelan signed her work with her married name, Albertine Randall Wheelan. For two decades prior to her move to New York, she was primary costume designer for David Belasco. She designed costumes for Belasco's opera A Grand Army Man in 1904, and for his 1907 production The Rose of the Rancho, as well as for the 1914 operetta Sari by C.S. Cushing, E.P. Heath, and Emmerich Kalman. Wheelan also illustrated children's books and magazines, including a number of pieces in St. Nicholas Magazine and Kindergarten Review, as well as The Quarterly Illustrator. Her illustrations for the children's book A Chinese Child's Day garnered praise in The New York Times in a 1910 piece on children's literature. She is noted in an article in the Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society as the designer of a bookplate for books \\"Given by the Ladies of the Temple Emanu-El, San Francisco,\\" in 1904. In the 1920s, Wheelan produced a newspaper comic called In Rabbitboro, originally published in the George Matthew Adams Service bulletin. A 1922 book on humorists listed her among \\"the principal newspaper comic artists of this country,\\" listing In Rabbitboro as her primary work of note. In Rabbitboro was later retitled The Dumbunnies, and Wheelan patented it as The Dumbunnies in 1927. Wheelan died in Litchfield, CT on January 9, 1954.  Exhibitions  Wheelan's work was included in the Woman's Building at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. In an account of women illustrators' work shown at the Fair, Alice C. Morse wrote that Wheelan \\"shows great originality, a remarkable sense of the humorous, and a daring handling of the pen. We enjoy hugely her Chinamen, cats, and other amusing creations. They are real beyond a shadow of a doubt, and one is positive that they have done, and will do again, all the ludicrous things that Mrs. Wheelan represents them as doing.\\" In March 1911, some of Wheelan's bookplates were shown in an exhibition at the Society of Arts and Crafts of Detroit, lent by a member of the California Book-Plate Society. In March 1935, the Carlyle Gallery exhibited some of Wheelan's drawings of \\"Spanish, Parisian, and Mallorcan subjects\\". In October 1937, Wheelan's travel sketches were exhibited at the Hudson Park Branch of the New York Public Library.

The factory manufactures the AK-203 variant of the Kalashnikov family of rifles. The factory is a joint-venture of the Ordnance Factory Board of India and Kalashnikov Concern of Russia, with Rosoboronexport holding a minority stake and will produce 750,000 AK-203s, a 7.62√ó39mm variant from the AK-100 family. Ownership The factory is a joint venture between three companies. The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) owns the controlling stakes of 50.5% while Kalashnikov owns 42% stake followed by 7.5% stake owned by Rosonboronexport. An Indian CEO from the Indian Army leads the company. The Army has appointed Major General Sanjeev Sengar as the Chief Executive Officer.  Background  Since the late 1950s, the Indian armed forces had been equipped with a locally produced licenced copy\\"UK and Commonwealth FALs, by R. Blake Stevens, Collector Grade Publications, 1980, pages 231‚Äì233 of the L1A1 self-loading rifles. In mid-1980s, the decision was taken to develop a 5.56√ó45mm NATO calibre rifle to replace the obsolete rifles. Trials on various prototypes based on the AKM were carried out by the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) in Pune. On the completion of the trial, The Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) was adopted in 1990, becoming the standard issue assault rifle of the Indian infantry. However, to phase out the still in use bolt- action Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles as quickly as possible, India had to acquire 100,000 7.62√ó39mm AKM-type rifles from Russia, Hungary, Romania and Israel in 1990‚Äì92. The INSAS was initially built with features borrowed from several different rifles and was not made to meet the specific requirements of the Indian security forces. This amalgamated design while serving the Army for over 30 years, has started to fall behind the needs of modern warfare. In recent years the rifle has come under increasing scrutiny, with several issues, surfacing from frontline forces that have inhibited operational capabilities. For example, the plastic magazine of the rifle has repeatedly cracked under cold weather conditions and has reportedly even overheated during long battles leading to malfunctions, making it an unreliable choice for a standard issue rifle. Due to these repeated downfalls, In April 2015, the Indian government even had to replace some INSAS rifles of the CRPF with AKM variants to ensure greater success in the CRPF's fight against Naxalites. Therefore, owing to these failures and the changing needs of the armed forces, it was announced in early 2017 that the INSAS rifles would be retired and replaced by a weapon capable of firing the larger 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridges. As part of the replacement process, the new Kalashnikov rifle was to be made in a joint venture production facility located in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh. The factory manufactures the AK-203 variant of the Kalashnikov family of rifles, which along with the SIG716, manufactured with by United States-based SIG Sauer will replace the INSAS rifles as well as the AK-47s.. The AK-203 along with the first batch of 10,000 SIG Sauer rifles were delivered in December 2019. The Indian Government is also in the process of procuring the UAE based Caracal International's CAR-816 as the Close Quarter Battle (CQB) carbine in order to replace the 9mm Sterling carbine. The procurement of these new weapons are a part of the Indian Army's ongoing modernisation drive, with a total budget of INR 3500 crores marked for the purpose of acquiring modern rifles. Product The IRRPL has been licensed to produce 750,000 AK-203 assault rifles chambered for 7.62√ó39mm. The AK-203 is a modernized 200 series AK-103 variant and one of the modern derivatives of the Russian AK-Pattern series of assault rifles. The 200 series are technically based on the AK-100 family and the more expensive AK-12 rifle family. The AK-203 is reported as the latest and most advanced version of the most abundant firearm in the world, the AK-47 assault rifle. During the Defence Expo 2020 in Lucknow, Major-General Sengar (Retd.) announced that the IRRPL facility in Amethi would produce the AK-203 at an annual rate of 75,000 carbines a year for a period of 10 years in total. Product specifications of the AK-203: * 3.8 Kg weight (without accessories and with an empty magazine) * A firing range of 800 m * Firing rate of 700 rounds over minute * A barrel length of 415 mm * A Collapsible buttstock * A total length of 943 mm and 704 mm with an unfolded and folded buttstock condition respectively * A standard plastic 30 round magazine. It was announced that 670,000 AK-203 rifles will be produced for the Indian military.  References  External Links *Demonstration of Kalashnikov AK 203 by Kalashnikov Concern.

She is also an advocate for diversity and almost became a professional soccer player when she was 16 .  Early life and education  Raised as a devout Muslim in Morocco's capital, Rabat, Hafidi showed an early curiosity of the theoretical. ‚ÄúWhen I was little,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI used to tell my dad, ‚ÄòI want to learn what God is made of. I believe in him, but I don't see him.'\\" Hafidi was nudged towards a career in science by her father. When she had to decide between science and literature in ninth grade, her father, a middle-class bureaucrat in the Moroccan government, told her: \\"What will you do with literature? It's not useful to the country. Since you are good at everything, you should do science.\\" Drawing on her talent for solving rigorous logical problems that she developed during her high school training, Hafidi completed her bachelor degree in theoretical physics at Mohammed V. University in 1995 in Rabat, Morocco. In her interview for CNN Arabia (2017), Hafidi recalls the doctorate holders strike due to lack of jobs in 1995, in which the state responded to their demands by closing graduate schools, forcing Hafidi to travel to France to complete her graduate studies. However, her father didn't have the money to send her to college abroad. Luckily, her grandmother and aunts‚Äîthe youngest of whom is a physician‚Äîcame up with the funds, in some cases by selling jewelry. ‚ÄúThey would say, ‚ÄòWe cannot let you waste your talent here,' ‚Äú she says. She continued her studies at University Paris-Sud where she studied the electromagnetic structure of the Deuterium to receive her PhD in 1999. Hafidi was a member of the original Moroccan national women's soccer team, in 1992, and has a brown belt in mixed martial-arts fighting. Hafidi met her husband, Brahim, a Tunisian physicist, in Paris. The couple married in 1998, moved together to the US where they both work as physicists in Argonne National Laboratory. They had a son, Omar, in 2006. In an Interview with Patch (2011), Illinois, Hafidi talks about her work-life balance saying, \\"I think balance doesn't exist. There's only satisfaction. You try to find your own balance. You try to be satisfied with your choices. I'm still struggling with work/life balance, but what helps me a lot is my husband.\\" She reveals that her husband is the primary caretaker of their son and acknowledges his support.  Career  Hafidi first joined Argonne National Laboratory as a postdoc (1999‚Äì2002) and moved on to become an assistant physicist (2002‚Äì2006) and a physicist (since 2006). As a leading researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, Hafidi has been ‚Äúasking philosophical questions, addressing technical fields in detector and software development.‚Äù Expanding on her research interest of understanding the dynamics of subatomic particles (nucleons) and the forces by which they are held together, Hafidi collaborates with a team of scientists to study 3-D distributions of partons (subatomic quarks and gluons) in nucleons and nuclei, by using particle accelerators at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Virginia, Fermilab in Illinois, and DESY in Hamburg Germany. Hafidi seeks to capture the moment when quarks become free, or transparent. Adjusting the accelerator's speed and intensity, her team found conclusive evidence of an exotic, short-lived state in which quarks are so small they become invisible to other matter, enabling them to pass through a nuclear medium without interaction. She was elected as a member of Jefferson Lab users group board of directors in 2010. She briefly left Argonne in 2013 to work for the Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Physics. In 2015, she returned as the Associate Chief Scientist for Laboratory Directed Research and Development at Argonne National Laboratory . In 2017, she was appointed as Director of the Physics Division , and additionally in 2018 as Associate Laboratory Director for Physical Science and Engineering. Hafidi also leads Argonne‚Äôs Women in Science and Technology (WIST) program. The WIST program provides leadership and resources to help advance the success of women, encourages professional growth and development and works to promote diversity at all levels within Argonne to create a premier institution for research and development. She was also the chair of the American Physical Society‚Äôs Committee on Status of Women in Physics (CSWP).

At its formation on November 30, 1901, the corporate title was the Chicago & Indiana Air Line Railway (Air Line). The Air Line was controlled by Frank and James Seagrave, brothers from Toledo, Ohio, who had envisioned an electrically operated freight and passenger railroad from Toledo to Chicago, Illinois. The Seagrave brothers had completed their Toledo and Western Railroad mainline across the former Great Black Swamp from Toledo to Pioneer, Ohio, in an area that otherwise had no direct rail service to Toledo. A branch was constructed from Sylvania, Ohio, to Adrian, Michigan.George S. Davis, The Interurban Electric Railways of Ohio, 18 Street Railway Journal 107, 113 (1901). The Seagraves‚Äô anticipated that they would build west to Goshen, Indiana, where they would obtain trackage rights from the Indiana Electric Railroad Company (later the Chicago, South Bend and Northern Indiana; successor company to the first commercial electric trolley line in North America) to South Bend where it would connect with the Air Line for Chicago.From Toledo to Chicago, 21 Street Railway Journal 132 (1903). Financing to complete the railroad was announced on January 17, 1903.From Toledo to Chicago, 21 Street Railway Journal 132 (1903). Property acquisition and engineering from South Bend west to the St. Joseph ‚Äì LaPorte county line was completed within the year.The Chicago, Lake Shore and South Bend Railway Company Right-of-Way Maps, 1911 (showing parcels with transaction dates). The Seagraves‚Äô also obtained franchises for operation in the streets of South Bend, New Carlisle, and Michigan City. The Seagraves‚Äô began street railway operations at East Chicago during September, 1903.William D. Middleton, South Shore: The Last Interurban 10 (1st ed. 1970). Grading for the railroad was begun in St. Joseph County during 1903, but the Rich Man‚Äôs Panic put an end to the work and apparently the Seagraves‚Äô interest in the company.Profile - Chicago, Lake Shore & South Bend Railway ‚Äì South Bend to Hammond (showing dates of engineering and grading, but the overall date of this antique document is not legible). The historical significance of the Seagraves‚Äô effort in developing what would become the South Shore Line was that in 1903 there was no business model for a short line regional high-speed electrified railroad handling freight and passengers. Economic historians George Hilton and John Due noted in their history of the interurbans that the Seagraves‚Äô effort was probably the first.Hilton & Due, The Electric Interurban Railways in America 264 (1st ed. 1960). But for the Panic of 1903, the Seagraves‚Äô would have likely completed what is recognized today as a regional high-speed electrified railroad from Toledo to Chicago. The directors of the Air Line voted for a corporate name change on July 30, 1904: The Chicago, Lake Shore and South Bend Railway Company (South Shore Lines).Jay Samuel Hartt, Central Electric Railfan‚Äôs Association Address (1962). In 1907, with the easing of monetary pressures, property acquisition, engineering, and construction began again under the direction of a new promoter, James B. Hanna.Contracts and Contracts, 2 Electric Traction Weekly 44, 47 (1906); An Important Road Contemplated for Indiana, 28 Street Railway Journal 151 (1906). Although the scope of the project was then limited to a rail line from Chicago to South Bend, the business model posited by the Seagraves‚Äô remained. The first phase of construction from South Bend to Michigan City was completed and in scheduled service on July 1, 1908. The remainder of the line from Michigan City to Hammond was in service on September 6, 1908,Norman Carlson, Chicago South Shore & South Bend Railroad: How the Medal Was Won 10 (1985). only twenty-one days before the first Ford Model T automobile left the Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit.Ford Model T, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T. Not only was the South Shore Lines embroiled in a transportation war with the automobile, but it was also unwittingly embroiled in the War of the Currents waged by Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse. Edison famously clung to his original direct current system, while Westinghouse embraced the alternating current system developed by Nikola Tesla.Margaret Cheney & Robert Uth, Tesla: Master of Lightning 23-33 (1999). The South Shore Lines unwisely chose the Westinghouse Electric Corporation system. Some twenty other interurbans adopted the Westinghouse system, most between 1904 and 1908. The alternating current system was not perfected however, and nearly all the lines operating with it were quickly converted to direct current, some in as little as three years. The South Shore Lines never found itself in a financial position to convert to direct current despite the high expense of maintaining the alternating current system.Hilton & Due, The Electric Interurban Railways in America 62 (1st ed. 1960). Wreck at Shadyside, Indiana, 19 June 1909. The motorman of eastbound car #73 (foreground) overran a meeting point and collided with westbound car #3. As a result, twelve were killed and 25 injured. The South Shore Lines found itself in financial difficulty from the start as passenger revenues were insufficient to cover the railway‚Äôs bonded indebtedness. This was exacerbated by claims resulting from two head-on wrecks in 1909 that resulted in an unfunded legislative mandate to install a costly block signal system.Traffic and Transportation, 33 Electric Railway Journal 853, 854 (1909).Traffic and Transportation, 33 Electric Railway Journal 1178, 1179 (1909).William D. Middleton, South Shore: The Last Interurban 14 (1st ed. 1970). Despite these setbacks, service had been extended to Pullman on Chicago‚Äôs South Side on April 4, 1909.The Chicago, Lake Shore & South Bend Railway, 33 Electric Railway Journal 674 (1909). An agreement with the Illinois Central Railroad dated May 25, 1912, called for non-motorized trail coaches to be attached to trains originating in Gary to be hauled by steam locomotives for the run to Randolph Street near Chicago‚Äôs Loop.Interline Steam and Electric Service Between Chicago and Gary, 39 Electric Railway Journal 925 (1912). Attempting to overcome inadequate earnings, the South Shore Lines made every effort to develop freight service in 1916,High Lights of History of the South Shore Line Transportation Department 14 (1926). and an excursion business to bring Chicagoans to the Indiana Dunes, the amusement park at Michigan City, and the Casino at Hudson Lake. The most significant of the rail excursions to the development of Northwest Indiana were the regular outings of the Prairie Club of Chicago on the South Shore Lines that began in 1909.Cathy Jean Maloney, The Prairie Club of Chicago 14 (2001). The access to the Dunes that the South Shore Lines provided to the Prairie Club led the members to erect cabins in the Dunes. With assistance from Stephen Mather, the first director of the National Park Service, The Prairie Club soon waged a lobbying campaign for the creation of a Sand Dunes National Park that for a time was unsuccessful, but did culminate in the opening of the Indiana Dunes State Park in 1925. Congressional authorization of a National Park Service unit in the Dunes in 1966 resulted in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore (now Indiana Dunes National Park).Cathy Jean Maloney, The Prairie Club of Chicago 63 (2001). In 1925, the Cleveland Trust Company still held the original construction bonds of the South Shore Lines in the amount of $9,500,000.James Walker, Cost of Reproduction and Cost of Reproduction Less Accrued Depreciation as of May 1, 1925 Based on Prices Prevailing at Time of Appraisal of the Property of The Chicago, Lake Shore and South Bend Railway Company in Indiana 2 (1925). Earlier, in 1924, Samuel Insull, a utilities developer who had electric and gas utility investments throughout much of the United States sought a means of developing a new customer base with a balanced electrical load in the Indiana Dunes country. Samuel Insull, The Memoirs of Samuel Insull: An Autobiography 180-81 (1992). After investigating both the South Shore Lines and the Chicago, South Bend and Northern Indiana, Insull had the South Shore Lines appraised. Based upon the depreciated appraised value of $6,463,076,James Walker, Cost of Reproduction and Cost of Reproduction Less Accrued Depreciation as of May 1, 1925 Based on Prices Prevailing at Time of Appraisal of the Property of The Chicago, Lake Shore and South Bend Railway Company in Indiana Cover Letter (1925). and with a commitment to invest $2,500,000 in the property, Insull purchased the original construction debt from Cleveland Trust in exchange for 6% noncumulative debentures. Insull controlled a 60% majority stock interest in the new company. The closing of the transaction took place on June 29, 1925, six days after Insull formed the South Shore Line.Norman Carlson, Chicago South Shore & South Bend Railroad: How the Medal Was Won 9,63 (1985).

It runs from Falkoner All√© in the northwest to B√ºlowsvej in the southeast, linking Godth√•bsvej with Rosen√∏rns All√©. The street is dominated by the University of Copenhagen's Frederiksberg Campus. It takes its name after Rolighed, a Rococo-style country house from 1770 which is now owned by the university. History Rolighed seen from Gammel Kongevej in 1850 Rolighedsvej Godth√•bsvej originates in one of the oldest roads in the area. Associated with Ladeg√•rden, a farm established by Christian IV, although possibly considerably older, it was the first of several \\"royal roads\\" in the area. From 1664, it was referred to as \\"Den gamle Kongevej\\" (\\"The Old Royal Road\\") to distinguish it from New Royal Road (now Gammel Kongevej). It was for centuries also known as the Islevvej (Islev Road) and later as Granddalsvej (Gr√∏ndal Road). From circa 1855, the inner part of the road became known as Rolighedsvej after the country house Rolighed which had stood on the side of the road since circa 1770. The outher part of the street was renamed Godsh√•bsvej after Store Godth√•b, another country house. J.H. Rubens Fabrikker K√∏benhavns Sygehjem Several large new buildings were constructed along the road in the 1850s. J. H. Rubens Fabrik, a textile factory, opened at the corner with Falkoner Alle in 1854. Rolighedsvej seen on a situation plan from 1896 K√∏benhavns Sygehjem, a private hospital, opened on the north side of the road in May 1859. A large site on the south side of the street was reserved for the Royal Veterinarian School. It moved into a large new building on B√ºlowsvej in 1859. Land√∏konomiske Fors√∏gslaboratorium (Agricultural Economic Research Laboratory) opened next to K√∏benhavns Sygehjem 1882-1883. Frederiksberg Sugar House (Frederiksberg Sukkerhus) was located at No. 18. It was founded in 1889 by Fritz Paustian (1862-1935). The freight railway between N√∏rrebro and Frederiksberg crossed the street from the 1864. It existed until 1930. From 24 July 1884, Falkonerall√©ens Sporvejsselskab operated a tram service between Frederiksberg Runddel and Halmtorvet (now R√•dhuspladsen) by way of Rolighedsvej. Frederiksberg Iron Foundry and Machine Factory was founded at Falkoner All√© (No. 42) in 1872 but relocated to Rolighedsvej (No. 15) in the 1930s. The Royal Danish Society for Agriculture (Det Kongelige Danske Landhusholdningsselskab) relocated to a building at No. 26. It was designed by Tyge Hvass. Notable buildings and residents St. Thomas' Church Hostrups Have (No. 8), a Functionalist housing estate, was built in 1935-36 to design by Hans Dahlerup Berthelsen. It is located at the site where Ruben's textile factory was previously located. It incorporates a central greenspace. Falkonerhuset (No. 15-18), a Historicist property from 1897, was designed by G. Hassing. St Thomas' Church (No, 16) is a Church of Denmark parish church. It was inaugurated in 1898 to a design by Carl Lendorf. Rolighed Rolighed (No. 21) is today owned by the University of Copenhagen. Built in about 1770, it is one of few surviving examples of the summer retreats which dominated Frederiksberg from the late 18th century and until the area was absorbed by the expanding city in the second half of the 19th century. To the rear of the building is a group of associated stables and other farm buildings arranged around a central courtyard. K√∏benhavns Sygehjem's former building (No. 23) is now home to the University of Copenhagen's Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management. The Late Neoclassical building is from 1859 and was designed by Harald Conrad Stilling. It was expanded by R√∏rb√¶k & M√∏ller Arkitekter in 2013. Rolighedsvej 23 Land√∏konomisk Fors√∏gslaboratorium's former building (No. 25) is now home to the Department of Food and Resource Economy. The building is from 1883 and was designed by Ludvig Fenger. It was expanded with a free-standing building designed by Hans Georg Skovgaard to the east in 1935. The two buildings are now connected by a glazed skywalk. The complex has been sold to the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais Prins Henrik. The school will relocate to the site once an extension has been completed in 2021. Public art Statue of N. J. Fjord In front of Land√∏konomisk Fors√∏gslaboratorium's former building (No. 25) stands a bronze statue of Niels Johannes Fjord. The statue is from 1892 and was created by Aksel Hansen. Fjord was a driving force behind the foundation of the institution and served as its president until his death. He was also president of the Royal Danish Society for Agriculture (Det Kongelige Danske Landhusholdningsselskab). Nearby N. J. Fjords All√© is also named after Fjord. Transport The Forum (East) and Frederiksberg (Southwest) metro stations are both located approximately 500 metres from the street. Both stations serve the M1 and M2 lines. A new metro station on the City Circle Line will open at Aksel M√∏llers Have, some 300 m to the west of the street, in 2019. The former railway trac√© has been converted into a super bikeway.

It was built in 1966, and is the tallest building in the city.  Background  A 250-year long lease was acquired in 2017 by Cardiff-based developers Garrison Barclay Estates (GBE) for ¬£6.5m, and the building is now undergoing a ¬£12m redevelopment. It has received investment from the Welsh Government of loans up to ¬£2 million. The building is located on Upper Dock Street. The building is accessible from both sides, at its front via the newly built Friars Walk shopping centre as well as at the rear via the historic retail hub in the city, Commercial Street. The building is expected to re-open following refurbishment by Summer 2019.  Etymology  The building is a tribute to the participants of the 1839 Newport Rising, a key moment in the Chartist political movement. The Newport uprising was a key turning point in the campaign for universal suffrage. Led by John Frost, after whom John Frost Square is named, the protest saw nearly 10,000 men from the Newport area storm the Westgate Hotel. It was on that site that a group of men were supposedly imprisoned, with the protesters' anger rising following the imprisonment of leader Henry Vincent on 2 August, and the rejection of the People's Charter of 1838 by Parliament. The protest led to 26 deaths, including 22 Chartists, with 200 men later arrested by authorities for their involvement. Leaders John Frost, Zephaniah Williams, and William Jones were sentenced to be hung, drawn, and quartered, though the protest led to wider protests across the UK. Facing national pressure, the Lord Chief Justice eventually lobbied the Home Secretary to commute the sentences. Frost, Williams, and Jones were instead sent to Australia, punished with transportation for life. Only Frost eventually returned. Developers GBE have indicated the building will continue to pay tribute to the 1839 events, with features in the redevelopment referencing the movement and its significance to the city.  Redevelopment  Chartist Tower visible behind the Newport City Footbridge, foreground In September 2018, developers GBE submitted their application for change of use of the Tower to \\"part hotel, ancillary facilities (gym, conference space, storage space, offices & restaurant) and ground floor coffee shop\\". The application further includes \\"office floor space [...] a restaurant [...] and external alterations to the facade of Chartist Tower [...] and to the retail units fronting Upper Dock Street, Austin Friars (former Units 1-7 & 12-13) and Commercial Street (the former BHS)\\". Planning permission was approved on the 7th February 2019. Media reports have suggested the upper floor space will be let to the Mercure hotel chain, with other 3-4 chain names in discussions, including the Celtic Manor. The site has space for between 120 and 160 bedrooms on site, depending on the developer. There is approximately 30,000 sq. ft of office space and 18,000 sq. ft of ground floor retail space. Powell Dobson Architects have been appointed to act on the redevelopment, with Bristol based Hydrock providing design consultancy. Cardiff's architectural and interior design practice The IAD Company were appointed as interior designers for the project. In April 2019 it was announced that the Welsh Government had awarded the project up to ¬£2 million in Visit Wales and Targeted Regeneration Investment programme loans, with the Deputy Ministers for both Housing and Local Government; as well as Culture, Tourism and Sport, affirming their commitment to the project.}  See also  * Newport city centre  References   External links  * Garrison Barclay Estates website *Newport City Council - Planning Online: application 18/0904 Category:Buildings and structures in Newport, Wales Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1966 Category:Landmarks in Newport, Wales ","title":"Chartist Tower"},{"id":"60128847","text":"Alessandra Lanzara is an Italian-American physicist and the distinguished Charles Kittel Professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley since 2002, where she leads an experimental materials physics group.

History Carmichael was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and educated in Glasgow. He studied chemistry under Professor Dittmer at the Andersonian College (\\"The Place of Useful Learning\\"), and gained experience at city analysts Wallace, Tatlack, and Clarke. He worked at Charles Tennant's \\"St Rollox\\" laboratories adjacent the Monkland Canal for 14 years, rising to the level of chief technical chemist. In 1889 left for Victoria, Australia, where he found employment with Felton, Grimwade & Co and with the Australian Explosives and Chemical Company. He joined the Metals Extraction Company, and was sent to Broken Hill with metallurgist Askin Nicholas to troubleshoot one of Junction North mine's processes. In 1894 he joined Broken Hill's Block 10 Company as assayer, then in October 1896 joined \\"The Proprietary\\" (BHP). Around this time he began experimenting with ways of converting refractory zinc sulphide to the oxide. In 1901 he worked with Leslie Bradford in developing the Carmichael‚ÄìBradford desulphurisation process for conversion of sulphide ores to their oxides prior to smelting, which enabled recovery of valuable metal from the great piles of tailings at the mines, and the manufacture of sulphuric acid, leading to the founding of the Zinc Corporation. They floated the Carmichael-Bradford Desulphurising Co. in 1908 to manage international patents; apart from BHP little interest was shown and the company was wound up in 1912.

Frischknecht is an American theoretical polymer physicist at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society (APS) in 2012 for \\"her outstanding contributions to the theory of ionomers and nanocomposites including the development and application of density functional theory to polymers\\". Her research focuses on understanding the structure, phase behavior, and self-assembly of polymer systems, such as complex fluids polymer nanocomposites, lipid bilayer assemblies, and ionomers.  Education  Frischknecht graduated from Pomona College in Claremont, California, with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in physics and mathematics in 1992. Later she received a PhD degree in physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara. The title of her 1992 doctoral thesis is \\"Stability of domains in phase-separating binary fluids in shear flow,\\" and her PhD advisor was James S. Langer, who is currently a Professor Emeritus of physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Career and research  Frischknecht went to work at ExxonMobil Research & Engineering Co. as a postdoctoral fellow. She stayed there from 1998 until 2000 and worked on polymer rheology with Scott Milner, who is now a professor of physics at Pennsylvania State University. They investigated the dynamics of polymer melts made star-shaped polymers, which are a branched polymer in which several chains are linked together via a central core. They also studied diffusion of linear polymers. In 2000, Frischknecht moved to Sandia National Laboratories, working first as a postdoctoral fellow and then becoming a permanent member of staff. To understand the behavior of polymers, she relies mostly on molecular modeling techniques like density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Notable works include simulations of ionic polymers (polymers that contain ions that are chemically bound to their structure) to find their structures that they form. She has also studied the rheology of polymer- nanoparticle blends, finding that when the blend is placed on a substrate a first-order phase transition occurs that expels the polymer from the surface, causing the particles to form a monolayer.  Committees  Frischknecht serves as the Chair-Elect of the Division of Polymer Physics (DPOLY) at the American Physical Society (APS), a position that runs from 2019 to 2020. She previously served as a member at large for DPOLY from 2013-2015. She chaired the 2018 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Polymer Physics titled \\"New Developments in Hierarchical Structure and Dynamics of Polymers.\\" The theme of the conference was new experimental, simulation, and theoretical developments in polymer physics.

However, to safeguard him and his friends, Saro takes Anantharaman's body to Divya's house and lies that her father passed away due to a heart attack while jogging. Everyone gathers for the cremation ceremony of Anantharaman. Saro tries hard to pretend that no one finds out the truth about his friends‚Äô involvement in the murder. Finally, Saro's friend discloses that they have mistakenly fed him anesthesia instead of poison, and so Anantharaman should only be in an unconscious state and is not dead yet. Saro gets even more angry as his friends have put him in bigger trouble. Suddenly, there comes a couple of two women claiming them to be Anantharaman's wives. Divya gets shocked upon knowing that her father had extramarital affairs with a few more women. Now slowly, Anantharaman wakes up as the anesthesia's effect is recovered and is shocked to see all of his women together. Saro uses this situation to his advantage and informs Divya that this drama was set by him to prove that every human has an evil side. Finally, Saro joins with Divya.

History  The SB series of bombs were designed to be high-capacity bombs that were intended to create the largest lateral blast effect on detonation. This was in contrast to most other German bombs, which were either armor-piercing, cluster bombs, fragmentation or incendiaries. Since the SB series wasn't designed to pierce armor or to create fragments, the casing of the series were very light and the ratio of charge to weight was high at 73%, while the majority of general-purpose bombs were up to 50%.  Design  The SB 1000 had a welded sheet metal body with either a drawn or welded steel nose piece. The nose piece was threaded and was streamlined to reduce drag while the bomb was attached to the aircraft. The SB 1000 had no base plate and was filled through the nose with a central exploder tube which ran through the center of the bomb from the fuze pocket to the nose. The tail of the SB 1000 was constructed of drawn steel and had four fins inside a circular strut. The SB 1000 was suspended horizontally by an H-type lug or trunnions if carried by dive bombers. The SB 1000 was filled with a mixture of RDX biscuits within a Trialen 105 matrix. Trialen 105 was a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminum powder.

The British historian Paul Preston has pointed out that the Guardia Mora became a symbol in itself and the best example of the new power that was being built around the figure of Franco.Preston, Paul (2011). Franco ¬´Caudillo de Espa√±a¬ª. Barcelona: Random House Mondadori. p.234. After the end of the Civil War, the Moroccan units of the Army of Africa were either disbanded or returned to Spanish Morocco, but a select group of soldiers and officers remained on the peninsula, as mounted guards, performing ceremonial functions and providing protection for the Head of State. When Franco moved his official residence to Madrid, the Guardia Mora followed him, and once established in the capital they came to have a permanent quartering in the Palace of El Pardo, official residence of the \\"generalissimo.\\"Cardona, Gabriel (2012).

Depicted as a mural decorating the Long Corridor of the Summer Palace, in Beijing. Chinese mythological geography refers to the related mythological concepts of geography and cosmology, in the context of the geographic area now known as \\"China\\", which was typically conceived of as the center of the universe. The \\"Middle Kingdom\\" thus served as a reference point for a geography sometimes real and sometimes mythological, including lands and seas surrounding the Middle Land, with mountain peaks and sky (Heaven or heavens) above, with sacred grottoes and an underworld below, and even sometimes with some very abstract other worlds. Chinese mythological geography is very important because it involves a lot of mythology, history, and social science concepts of current usage as well as during previous uncounted millennia. Mythological geography of China \\"Chinese mythology\\" refers to mythology associated with the geographic area now known as \\"China\\", and in traditional Chinese mythology often known as the \\"Middle Kingdom\\". Chinese mythology includes many varied myths from regional and cultural traditions. Chinese mythology is far from monolithic, not being an integrated system, even among just Han people. Chinese mythology is encountered in the traditions of various classes of people, geographic regions, historical periods including the present, and from various ethnic groups. China is the home of many mythological traditions, including that of Han Chinese and their Huaxia predecessors, as well as Tibetan mythology, Turkic mythology, Korean mythology, and many others. However, the study of Chinese mythology tends to focus upon material in Chinese language. Much of the mythology involves exciting stories full of fantastic people and beings, the use of magical powers, often taking place in an exotic mythological place or time. Along with Chinese folklore, Chinese mythology forms an important part of Chinese folk religion (Yang 2005, 4, and elsewhere). In these cases, Chinese mythological geography forms and informs these ideational processes. Cosmology \\"Cosmology\\" refers to the entirety of the Earth and its environment, significantly including Heaven (or Sky), Earth, a mythological underworld, and other less Earth-oriented conceptual locations. Heaven \\"Heaven\\" (or \\"Sky\\") refers to the universe outward of the Earth's surface. Underworld Hell Scroll at Seattle Asian Art Museum \\"Underworld\\" (or \\"Hell\\") refers to the universe located underneath the Earth's surface. Apparently this motif appears relatively late in the course of the development of Chinese mythology. The introduction of Buddhism certainly seems to have included a greater focus upon the fate of the soul and detailed depictions of a possible afterlife underground. Otherworldly locations \\"Non-Earth-based locations\\", include, for example the Pure Lands of Buddhism. Geography Middle earth The perspective of Chinese mythological geography tends to focus on the locus of those possessing the myths, as a \\"center\\" or \\"middle\\" area, based on land, with Sky above, Underworld below, and replete with mountains, seas, islands, and grottoes. Mythological locations tend to be replete with local inhabitants, of a mythological variety. Although Chinese mythological geography tends to focus on humans existing on a middle land territory of earth, a major motif is change, such as in the flood mythology of China. Mountains Various mountains present an appearance in Chinese mythology. The Kunlun Mountain(s) of mythology are associated with a number of deities, such as Xiwangmu, Yu Shi, various shamans, and xian immortals. =Example= As the mythology related to the Kunlun developed, it became influenced by the later introduction of ideas about an axis mundi from the cosmology of India. The Kunlun became identified with (or took on the attributes of) Mount Sumeru (Christie 1968, 74). Grottoes The counter feature to the holy or sacred mountains and peaks were the grotto-heavens, and various grottoes appear in Chinese mythological landscape. Sometimes sacred grottoes are associated with sacred mountains; and both may correspond to actual geolocations, but with an overlay of mythological geography. Seas Various seas or oceans present an appearance in Chinese mythology. Sometimes \\"the Sea\\" appears in a generic way, or in a directionally designated way such, as in the Jingwei story involving the Eastern Sea. Often a Dragon King was located in a sea, appropriately palaced. Sometimes sea and dry land were thought to alternate, as in the case of the Mulberry Fields and the sea related in the story of Magu. Rivers Various rivers appear in Chinese mythology. =Example= Various mythological geography is associated with the Red River, including one or more of the eight mountain pillars, especially the rivers thought to flow from or surround (mythological) Kunlun Mountain, the Weak River, the Black River, and intervening terrain, such as the Moving Sands. Jade Mountain was also in the vicinity (Yang 2005: 160-162). Islands Various islands present an appearance in Chinese mythology. Inhabitants and other features The inhabitants and features of Chinese mythological geography add life and interest to the whole subject, and contribute toward more complete mythological narratives. Examples include mythological plants, animals, humans, other beings, magical jewels, weapons and other objects.

Tascona's employment in the aircraft industry as a technician taught him the techniques used in his mature work featuring geometric abstraction. His work hangs in numerous public institutions in and throughout Canada. He was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1996.  Early life and education  Tascona was born the fifteenth of sixteen children in the predominantly francophone town of St Boniface, Manitoba before it was incorporated into Winnipeg in 1971. Tascona left school and became a truck-driver at age fifteen in order to support his family after his father's death. When he was seventeen his mother died and he would be conscripted into the Canadian Army at eighteen, but never deployed overseas. In 1946 Tascona enrolled in the Winnipeg School of Art through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. His instructor Joe Plaskett introduced him to Hans Hofmann's theories on abstraction. After receiving his diploma, he continued his education at the University of Manitoba School of Art and was there exposed to other modernist movements such as Vorticism.ref> In 1953 Tascona began work as a technician for Trans-Canada Airlines where he developed his skills and interest in working with a variety of industrial techniques and materials including a fascination with aluminum, high-grade paints, lacquers and enamels.ref> This formation of interest extended to his brother's auto-body garage, where Tascona became interested in the use of car paint, borrowing paint chips and supplies for use in his own studio. In 1961 Tascona moved to Montreal where he became acquainted with the works of Les plasticiens artists such as Guido Molinari and Claude Tousignant for what he called their \\"direct, more mathematical, more geometric approach.‚Äùref> In 1965 Tascona was introduced to the theories of Constructivism by William Townsend. However Tascona was not interested in the explicitly political elements inherent to Constructivism. Nonetheless Tascona was inspired by Tatlin's prediction that the art of the future would be synthesised with principles of technology and construction.  Development of constructions  Utilizing the skills he learned in the aircraft industry, Tascona began in the late 1960s and would continue throughout the 70's and 80's to produce large format constructions built from incised metal sheets painted with industrial strength paints and lacquers giving these works a sculptural, frieze-like quality while still possessing certain modernist formal elements. An early example is Tascona's first major commission in 1963 for the Manitoba Centennial Concert Hall which still hangs in situ today. This was his first construction and consisted of two ten by sixteen foot constructions consisting of numerous layered sheets of aluminium and painted using his unique industry-inspired technique.

Established in 2010, the agency is responsible for developing and implementing communications satellite programs and other space projects. On 20 December 2013, the ABE oversaw the launch of the nation's first artificial satellite, T√∫pac Katari 1. The satellite began operating the following year, providing telecommunication services to rural Bolivia. History On 10 February 2010, President Evo Morales signed a decree establishing the Bolivian Space Agency as a government agency under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works, Services and Housing. The agency was tasked with promoting and developing satellite projects, and implementing their application in education, health and weather forecasting programs. The ABE began with a modest initial budget of US$1million, with the Bolivian government planning to seek further funding through donations and loans from China and other countries. T√∫pac Katari 1 The agency oversaw the launch of T√∫pac Katari 1‚ÄîBolivia's first artificial satellite‚Äîon 20 December 2013. The communications satellite was named for T√∫pac Katari, an 18th-century Aymara native who led a rebellion against the Spanish Empire. The satellite was built by Great Wall Industrial Corporation at a cost of US$302 million, 85% of which was provided by a China Development Bank loan. It was launched into orbit from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China. T√∫pac Katari 1 began operation in March 2014. According to President Morales, the satellite would lower the cost of Internet, television and phone services in the country. The satellite also improved communications access in rural parts of the country, providing remote education (via teleconferencing and educational television) and telemedicine programs. The director of the Bolivian Space Agency, Iv√°n Zambrana, reported in 2018 that the satellite's services had raised over US$80million in the first four years of operation. According to Zambrana, this amount of revenue exceeded the agency's expectations, and would allow the satellite to be fully paid off within fifteen years.

It depicts a man and a woman amid ruined architecture. The work is a synthesis of influences from the Pre-Raphaelite, Symbolist and Aesthetic art movements. The ambiguous scene without a clear narrative is considered one of Burne-Jones' best works. Description The title refers to Robert Browning's poem Love Among the Ruins, published in Men and Women in 1855. The subtext is the ending of Burne- Jones' four-year love affair with his model Maria Zambaco. She attempted to commit suicide in the Regent's Canal in 1869 after he attempted to end their affair. The work depicts two lovers in blue robes, a man and a woman, seated together on a stone capital amid the ruins of buildings. A broken column is at their feet, covered with briar rose, perhaps an allusion to Burne-Jones' Briar Rose series. In the background is a door with a frieze of putti, and arches leading into the distance. The setting may be influenced by the ruins of Polyandrion from the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. When sold at Christie's in 2013, the lot essay identified the models as the Italians, Alessandro di Marco and Antonia Caiva. Others have suggested that they may be Maria Zambaco and Gaetano Meo. The model in the second version may be Bessie Keeane. Whoever the models are, the male and female figures are taken to allude to Burne-Jones himself, and his lover Maria Zambaco. Watercolour The watercolour was painted on paper from 1870 to 1873 at the studio of John Roddam Spencer Stanhope at Little Campden House, on Campden Hill in Kensington. It was made from watercolour mixed with gouache and gum arabic, giving it a finished appearance resembling an oil painting. It measures (37.9‚Ä≥ x 60 ‚Ä≥) and is signed with the initials \\"EBJ\\" to the lower left, and signed \\"Edward Burne Jones\\" on the backboard. The backboard bears the typed inscription \\"This Picture, being painted in WATER/COLOUR, would be injured by the slight-/est moisture./Great care must be used whenever/it is removed from the Frame\\". While he was working on the painting, Burne-Jones painted a miniature watercolour version in 1872 for William Morris's calligraphic manuscript of Edward FitzGerald's translation of The Rub√°iy√°t of Omar Khayy√°m. The completed full-size watercolour was first exhibited at the Dudley Gallery at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly in 1873, alongside another watercolour, The Garden of the Hesperides (now in the Kunsthalle Hamburg). It was one of few works that Burne-Jones exhibited after he withdrew in high dudgeon from the Old Watercolour Society in 1870, over the negative reception of his watercolour of Phyllis and Demopho√∂n (which included a full-frontal naked male figure, and a portrait of his mistress Maria Zambaco), and before he started to exhibit at the Grosvenor Gallery when it opened in 1877. It was an immediate critical and popular success. Burne-Jones himself rated it very highly, and it was praised by George du Maurier as \\"very stunning - almost the best thing he's done\\". Writing later, Julia Cartwright has said it was \\"one of the master's most perfect and beautiful creations\\", and Malcolm Bell called it \\"the most impressive of the painter's works, with its vague hint of an untold tragedy that haunts the memory\\". Love Among the Ruins and The Garden of Hesperides were bought from the artist in 1873 by his patron the Manchester businessman Fredrick Craven. Love Among the Ruins was loaned for exhibition at the 1878 Exposition Universelle in Paris, the inaugural exhibition at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 1885, the Royal Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester in 1887, and for exhibition at the Guildhall, London and then at the Burne-Jones retrospective at the New Gallery both in 1892. After Burne-Jones' 1884 painting King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid was a great success at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, Love Among the Ruins was loaned for exhibition at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1893. While back in Paris, the prominent label warning that it was a watercolour and so susceptible to water damage was ignored, and an egg white wash was applied at the Goupil Gallery as a temporary varnish while the painting was being prepared for reproduction in photogravure. The watercolour was thought to be damaged beyond repair, and remained in Burne-Jones' studio for 5 years, turned against the wall. At the suggestion of the owner and his former assistant Charles Fairfax Murray, Burne-Jones was eventually persuaded in 1898 by to attempt a restoration, using ox gall to remove the egg white and then repainting the damaged head of the woman. The restoration was completed in May 1898, just a few weeks before his death in June 1898. The work was sold at Christie's in London in March 1908 for 1,575 guineas. Acquired by the art dealer Agnew's, it passed through several collections before being sold at Sotheby's in London in May 1958 for 480 guineas, and was acquired by Agnew's again. The original watercolour was auctioned again at Christie's in London in July 2013. Estimated at ¬£3m to ¬£5m, it sold for ¬£14.8m, then the highest sale price for a Pre-Raphaelite work. Oil painting Distraught that his treasured watercolour was irretrievably damaged in Paris in 1893, Burne-Jones immediately painted a second version in oils, which was exhibited at the New Gallery in 1894. The oil painting measures . It is signed and dated, bottom right: \\"EBJ 1894\\". A hand-written note by Burne-Jones on the back of the painting reads: \\"This oil painting of ‚ÄòLove Among the Ruins‚Äô is the same design as the one of the same name which I painted in watercolours, twenty one years ago, but which was destroyed in August last year. The present picture I began at once, and have made it as like as possible to the other, and have finished it this day. APRIL 23. 1894.Edward Burne Jones.\\" The second painting was in the collection of Mrs Robert Henry Benson by 1898. It was sold at Christie's in 1913, and acquired by Sir Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted. Inherited by his son Walter Samuel, 2nd Viscount Bearsted, it was donated to the National Trust in 1948, since when it has been exhibited among the Arts and Crafts interior d√©cor and Pre-Raphaelite paintings of Geoffrey Mander at Wightwick Manor, in Wolverhampton.

(Bomber Renault Aile Haute) - High wing Renault bomber) was a French World War I two-seat biplane bomber that dispensed with the novel variable incidence wing used on prior designs. Design The P.S.7 was an oversized, three bay biplane, developed from the preceding Paul Schmitt Aerobus. Each wing bay was divided by addition braces in the same manner as the SPAD VII so as to look like a 6 bay biplane. Its fuselage consisted of a fabric-covered wooden frame, while the flying surfaces were similarly constructed. The engine was mounted on a metal mount, covered with metal panels and equipped with a frontal radiator. The pilot and observer were placed behind the wings, while the fuel and oil tanks were located ahead of the pilot, directly behind the Renault 12 engine. The undercarriage was built of tubular steel, the wheels attached to a fixed horizontal axle. The armament consisted of a synchronized machine gun for the pilot and a second machine gun for the observer. Mountings for 150 kg bombs were mounted under the wings. Operational history The \\"Groupe de bombardement 3\\" (GB.3) - a bomb squadron of the four Escadrilles PS.125-128, which operated on the Western Front was equipped with the aircraft. The aircraft of the last delivery series, which went to the Escadrille PS.128, received an undercarriage with four wheels to improve the ground handling. At the time of delivery to the escadrilles of the A√©ronautique Militaire, the PS-7, constructed in 1915, was already obsolete. Their low speed made the slow and lumbering craft an easy target for enemy antiaircraft guns and fighters. Re-equipping with the more powerful 265 hp Renault engine could not sufficiently alleviate these shortcomings. The P.S.7 were therefore mainly used as a night bomber against long-range targets such as railroad stations and supply depots, as on 13./14. April 1917 against the railway stations in Marl and Cr√©cy-sur-Serre and on 2 May against a German airfield near Saint- Quentin. The oversized aircraft proved to be so difficult to control that accurately hitting targets was extremely difficult. In addition, the engine proved to be unreliable, so that the operational strength of the squadron temporarily dropped to only twelve machines. The crews now often took with them another Lewis machine gun and additional ammunition for defense, which further reduced the bomb load to 90 kg. Only on the express command of the High Command were further attacks by the squadron carried out. The last major attack was carried out on October 20, 1917. After that, more long-range missions due to the threat of German fighters and enemy anti-aircraft artillery was no longer possible. The remaining PS-7 GB.3 were replaced by January 1918 in the front line by Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter and Breguet 14s and transferred to training units.Nowarra, Heinz: The development of the aircraft 1914-1918 , Munich 1959.

Chillon's first film was shot on black and white Super 8 film, with a Spanish-language voice-over dubbed over another German one. With credits and most other onscreen text in German, the short film gives the impression of being a West German educational documentary film of the 1950s or 1960s. Its subject is the effect of an extraterrestrial plague brought to Earth by a Soviet chimpanzee cosmonaut after its capsule crash landed near the border with East Germany in 1958. Financed entirely by Chillon himself, the short film was selected for more than 200 international film festivals and received more than 45 awards within the first two years of its release, including a M√©li√®s d'Argent in 2010. Ham, the first chimpanzee in space, shown in the life support system used for his January 1961 flight ultimately leading to the manned orbital flights of NASA's Project Mercury. In the alternate history of Die Schneider Krankheit, the Soviets achieved this three years earlier, but with unforeseen consequences. Plot In 1958, recent history is presented in the form of a documentary about a crashed Soviet space capsule near the border with East Germany. Inside the capsule is a chimpanzee cosmonaut, taken and subjected to tests by West German scientists. Soon after the discovery, the same scientists and their assistants get sick. The sickness spreads, and within a month, the first of the infected begin to die. A struggle to find a cure ensues, resulting in a hybrid creature referred to as a chimera, genetically engineered from a green sea turtle, medicinal leech, and ocellated lizard whose purpose is to perform a kind of bleeding on the sick, effecting a limited cleansing of the patient's systems. The treatment extends survival by about ten months, but everyone, even those so treated, must wear gas masks to avoid new infections, which is the present state of things at the end of the documentary, in which a nuclear family is shown at home, each of them wearing a mask and living a \\"normal life\\". Cast Inspiration, themes, and analysis Javier Chillon's main inspiration was the \\"Hollywood look of the 50s and the educational films of that time, documentaries with an enormous propagandistic content\\". He was also inspired by the period's American newsreels and science fiction B movies, such as those by Roger Corman, and European classics such as Chris Marker's La Jet√©e (there is a flat shot done as an homage), and Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Die Schneider Krankheit shares a number of themes with Javier Chill√≥n's second short film, Decapoda Shock: monstrous creatures resulting from \\"spatial\\" mutations or genetic manipulation, primarily derived from the science fiction B movies of the 1950s, the \\"atomic age\\". The mockumentary attempts to make its viewers \\"believe what they are watching\\" and to recreate a time period \\"without using any archival footage.\\" Scholar remarks that this kind of \\"retro-inflected material enjoys significant popularity\\" in twenty-first century science-fiction short films, citing Die Schneider Krankheit, Matthew Savage's Reign of Death (2009), and Johan L√∂fstedt's Kometen (The Comet, 2004). Production Writing and development Chillon originally intended to set the film in France, but quickly realised that the story ought to take place in Germany, which has always been the country of \\"mad doctors\\" in popular culture, and moreover, the Cold War-era Partition provided an excellent context. There was a storyboard, but, as with a real documentary, there was no sequence development in terms of the movement of dramatic actors; a few sequences were invented on the fly during principal photography. Financing Chillon financed the two-and-a-half-year project himself for ‚Ç¨9000, obtaining various elements for free or cheaply through his family connections or friends: for example, the film's art director, his cousin, together with another friend who is a theatre set designer, were able to get the hospital beds for free from rental companies in Madrid, and all the sets were mounted in the loft of a friend's house. Essentially, the budget paid for rolls of film, petrol, and food. Casting and crew The approximately fifty or so non-professional actors who appear in the film were friends, or friends of friends, or parents of friends, and his own father, Javier Chillon, Sr. Even so, they were carefully cast: mainly Spanish, they had to look like Germans of the 1950s, to move and act like the people from the old documentaries, just doing their work, often oblivious to the camera. Chillon obsessed over that aspect. The only professional actor in Die Schneider Krankheit is Paco Casares, the narrator. Chillon saw the stage actor in a play and said to himself, this is the voice; he was easy to direct, and the entirety of his spoken text was recorded in one afternoon. Most of Chillon's small crew were made up of either members of his family or friends: his father (a painter and sculptor) worked alongside his mother in special effects; his cinematographer Luis Fuentes is a close friend, while make-up was done by a friend who is a professional make-up artist and hairdresser. Design It was important to Chillon to pay attention to the smallest details and create the right atmosphere; the individual elements (wardrobe, sets, actors, and so on) would only work when presented through the correct production values. For the most part the sets such as the tiled walls and floors, microscopes, hospital room, had to be constructed. Despite the aim at realism, it is still a science fiction film and could not be made without special effects, \\"however we tried not to use info graphics whenever it was possible.\\" > The criterion was clear: using the same techniques used by filmmakers of > that time. Models, make-up effects, animations from pictures previously shot > and superimposition effects are some of the techniques that helped to set > Die Schneider Krankheit in a very specific style and period. Filming The film was shot in Madrid, in black and white Super 8, with a 4:3 aspect ratio, as much for budgetary as for aesthetic reasons. Chillon had worked with 16mm and Super 16 as a student at Solent University, Southampton, but they were too expensive; he and Fuentes began investigating Super 8, wondering why it was no longer used professionally, and discovered friends from Solent University had worked with it, and lent them a Sankyo 320XL camera, which they thought looked like a \\"toy\\" when they first saw it; Chillon said jokingly it is the worst camera in the world, but he and Fuentes would not change it once they saw what it could do. Principal photography Shooting began with the most \\"delicate\\" parts of the short film, those with the largest sets, neither director nor cinematographer knowing what the outcome would be, having done no tests, also recording in ProHD, in case everything \\"went to hell\\", to have a video back-up. Most sequences were shot on a tripod, but in an effort to simulate an older documentary, they also included a few hand-held shots, Fuentes using Tri-X or Plus-X film depending on the amount of light for each shot. They used high contrast film and film grain, which are distinctive of the genre, along with automatic exposure and deliberate \\"velatures\\" to reinforce the documentary style: > The real challenge is to achieve the balance between the realism of longer > shots with little editing and a more cinematic look: distinctive camera > angles and hand-held camera shots. A delicate balance which will guide the > audience during the journey through the threatened world of Die Schneider > Krankheit. As most of the cast were not professional actors, they were not put off by the look of the Sankyo camera, until shooting began: it makes a lot of noise, and this led to some of the actors being surprised and not moving. Animation Most of the animation was done on poster prints in Super 8; the pan or tilt of the camera is real. The image of the human body is physical paper put on an easel and rolled. A 50 cm model of the landing space capsule was built by Chillon and his father out of porespan and cardboard, filmed and then integrated into the field. Editing The ten-minute film was edited down from sixty minutes of footage. The result is a film similar to the format of educational documentaries of the 1950s such as might be found in the Prelinger Archives. Sound and music Another element of realism in the film is the superimposing of the voices in German and Spanish, as Chillon explained: \\"Those documentaries had only one soundtrack, that's the reason why when they were dubbed, the original soundtrack had to be kept in and the translated narration had to be superimposed.\\" Both voices are heard on the soundtrack, \\"with a distinctive classic tone from the 1950s sci-fi films with characteristic melodies and effects from that era.\\" Cirilo Fern√°ndez is an Argentinian who studied music at Berklee and met Chillon through some friends. Chillon asked him to produce a 1950s B movie orchestral soundtrack with a theremin, which he did in a week, \\"without real instruments\\". Release Die Schneider Krankheit had its premiere at the 41st Sitges Film Festival on 2 October 2008. There is typically no Super 8 category at film festivals, so it was usually screened among video entries rather than 35 or 16 mm. Within the first two years of its release, the short film was selected for more than 200 international film festivals and received more than forty-five awards. In 2016, there was a special screening of the short with Chillon's third short film, They Will All Die in Space at the Skepto International Film Festival. Home media Die Schneider Krankheit and the director's second film, Decapoda Shock, appear as bonus material on a Spanish-subtitled DVD of Daniel Cockburn's 2010 feature film, You Are Here. Online platform The film is available in its entirety on Vimeo. Reception Critical response World War II-era German gas masks, evoking their use by civilians during the war (image below). Critics were impressed by the realism of Die Schneider Krankheit, which \\"painstakingly recreates an alternate history through a seamlessly authentic aesthetic.\\" The editors at Sin Final en el Guion suggest it is probably one of the best first films by any director. The realism achieved is of such a high degree that it was rejected by some early festivals because selectors believed archival footage had been used. As a result, disclaimers were placed at the beginning of the film to \\"let the viewer know that the images are original, and not extracted from real documentaries.\\" The opening sequence and end credits, along with the dual Spanish-German soundtrack, appear to have been convincing enough to lead some viewers to believe the film is genuinely of German origin (and in one case, Russian). It even won a Best Documentary award at the . Once the initial misunderstanding about archival footage had been cleared up, the short caught on very quickly, and received \\"raves on the festival circuit\\". Virginie S√©lavie calls the short \\"inventive, intelligent\\", and \\"fantastic\\": the \\"50s newsreel style is perfectly reproduced, while the reasonable tone of the reporter is brilliantly contrasted with the outlandish events depicted.\\" Christopher Webster calls the short a \\"perfect blend of newsreel, visual FX and creative storytelling\\". Photograph: \\"Gas Drill at a London Hospital- Gas Masks For Babies Are Tested, England, 1940\\" Artie Knapp was impressed right from the first shots, \\"with the camera tilting down through the trees to show us the crash site at long range ... a nearly prefect rendition of old documentary style right down to how the camera would move.\\" > This is science fiction that is a deadly accurate portrayal of the calm, > governmental, ponderous yet urgent, carefully-framed and full-of-import > quality found in mid-century documentary films. The humor is sly and builds > its effect gradually. It's also somewhat frightening. Reviewing the film at the Flatpack Festival, Alex King calls it a highlight of the event, but found it more than \\"somewhat frightening\\": \\"it captures perfectly the dark, clunky feel of old newsreels yet every single shot is created through original footage.\\" > The scene where an innocent 50s nuclear family sit around the television all > wearing sinister WWII gas-masks while the narrator explains how \\"normal > family life\\" has continued despite the epidemic is one of the most chilling > things I have ever seen on film. The special effects were likewise good enough to give a French reviewer goosebumps, who also suggested the short could have made a good story segment on The Twilight Zone. A reviewer on Ain't It Cool News called the film \\"without a doubt, one of the very oddest ‚Äì and very best ‚Äì bits of film that I've come across this year,\\" advising: \\"Don't try to understand, just enjoy.\\" A Canadian reviewer at the Fantasia International Film Festival expected that a short mockumentary \\"should be awful, but this 10 minute gem shot on 8mm Tri-X stock is brilliant.\\" Tim Hall, of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, gives the short a grade of \\"C\\", finding it \\"somewhat enjoyable if \\"a little bizarre\\"; he \\"wasn't sure where they were going with this film\\". Accolades By the end of its run in October 2011, Die Schneider Krankheit had been screened at 255 festivals, and won at least fifty awards or special mentions. ;2008 ;Awards *18th Fancine ‚Ä¢ Best Spanish Short Film *38th (Alcal√° de Henares) ‚Ä¢ Best Art Direction (√Ångel Boyado and Nino Morante) *15th CineMad - Cine Independiente y de Culto (Madrid) ‚Ä¢ Best Sci-Fi Short Film *10th (Soria) ‚Ä¢ Best Art Direction (‚Ç¨1000) *12th Muestra de Cine Independiente y Fant√°stico (Toledo) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film ;Special mention *8th Trieste Science+Fiction Festival ;2009 ;Awards *15th Concurso de Cortos de Leioa Bizkaia (Leioa) ‚Ä¢ Second Best Short Film *6th VisualSound (Barcelona) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *21st U.S. Super 8 Film and Digital Video (Rutgers University) ‚Ä¢ Best Experimental Short Film *27th Uruguay International (Montevideo) ‚Ä¢ Best International Short Film *15th Trofeu Torretes \\"especial Mar\\" (Calella) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Amateur Argumentative/Fiction Film *3rd Mockfest (Hollywood) ‚Ä¢ Zelig Award (for Innovation in Mockumentary Filmmaking) *10th Torrelavega (Torrelavega) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film - Video Section *5th Trayecto Corto (Velilla de San Antonio) ‚Ä¢ Best Art Direction *7th Caostica, (Bilbao) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film - Video Section *13th Primavera Cinematogr√°fica de Lorca (Murcia) ‚Ä¢ Second Best Short Film *5th Portello River (Padua) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *4th (Sax, Alicante) ‚Ä¢ Best Documentary Short Film *5th Cine Paradiso (Barrax) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *14th Certamen de Creaci√≥n Audiovisual (Cabra) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film (‚Ç¨2700) *2nd FicBueu (Bueu) ‚Ä¢ Best Art Direction (√Ångel Boyano & Nino Morante) ‚Ä¢ Best Make-Up and Hairdressing (Isabel Avernheimer & Mayte Gonz√°lez) ‚Ä¢ Best Costume Design (Ariadna Paniagua) *3rd Octubre de Por Barcelona Horror ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *15th (Paris) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *10th Buenos Aires Rojo Sangre ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *6th Certamen de Documental e V√≠deo Secuenciacero ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *1st Pasado y Futuro (Almendralejo) ‚Ä¢ Second Best Short Film *10th (Sonorama) ‚Ä¢ Jury Prize, Best Short Film *3rd CryptShow (Barcelona - Art Direction) ;Special mentions *3rd Cambridge International Super 8 Festival (Cambridge) *5th Cortomenar Festival Nacional de Cortometrajes (Colmenar Viejo) Jury ;2010 ;Awards *M√©li√®s d'Argent, presented at the 20th Espoo Cin√© International *3rd Escorto Festival (El Escorial) ‚Ä¢ Best Art Direction ‚Ä¢ Best Editing ‚Ä¢ Best Soundtrack ‚Ä¢ Best Make-Up and Hairdressing ‚Ä¢ Best Costume Design *4th Short Shorts (Mexico City) ‚Ä¢ Best Cinematography *10th Certamen de Creaci√≥n Joven Valencia Crea (Valencia) ‚Ä¢ Best Spanish Short Film *10th V√≠deo Jove (Alella) ‚Ä¢ (Professionals) Fourth Best Short Film *6th (Tapiales) ‚Ä¢ Best Foreign Short Film *3rd Festerror (Cine de Terror y Fant√°stico, Lloret de Mar) ‚Ä¢ Best Short Film *8th FIKE - √âvora International (√âvora) ‚Ä¢ Organization Award *12th FEC (European Short), National Competition (Cambrils) ‚Ä¢ Second Best Short Film *7th MIDEC (Universidad de La Laguna) ‚Ä¢ Best Cinematography *10th Festival de Cine de Lanzarote (Lanzarote) ‚Ä¢ Best Spanish Short Film ;Special mentions *6th (Lago, Calabria - Sui Generis Section) *8th International Super 8mm Festival (Szeged) ;2011 ;Award *1st Bio-Fiction Science Art (Vienna) ‚Ä¢ Special Award of the Jury References External links *Official online release on Vimeo *Official trailer on YouTube *Die Schneider Krankheit on IMDb Category:Spanish-language films Category:German-language films Category:2008 films Category:2008 animated films Category:2008 short films Category:2008 horror films Category:2000s animated short films Category:2000s science fiction horror films Category:Films set in 1958 Category:Films set in Germany Category:Spanish black-and-white films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish short films Category:Spanish drama films Category:Spanish science fiction films Category:Spanish horror films Category:2000s psychological drama films Category:Mockumentary films Category:Films about infectious diseases Category:Films about space programs Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Alternate history films Category:2008 drama films ","title":"Die Schneider Krankheit"},{"id":"60129913","text":"The 1970 Colorado State Rams football team was an American football team that represented Colorado State University in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) during the 1970 NCAA University Division football season.

The sector constituted part of the Alpine Line portion of the Maginot Line, between the Defensive Sector of the Rh√¥ne to the north, and the Fortified Sector of the Dauphin√© to the south. The works combined a number of pre-1914 fortifications with Maginot-style ouvrages, with many forward-positioned cavern-style frontier stations or avant-postes that proved effective in holding invading forces near the order. Surface of Ouvrage Saint-Gobain The sector formed a discontinuous line about long along France's frontier with Italy, from the Aiguille des Glaciers on the Mont Blanc massif, through Bourg-Saint-Maurice to the Moulini√®re peak on the Massif des Cerces, to Valloire. The sector's fortifications barred the valleys and passes crossing the Alps, particularly the routes over the Little St Bernard Pass via the Tarentaise Valley and the Mont Cenis pass via the Maurienne valley. The sector's fortifications were built during the 1930s and saw combat during the Italian invasion of France in 1940 and later during the Second Battle of the Alps in 1944. The 1940s actions were successful in holding off the Italian invasion, but the surrender of France as a whole left the works in Italian occupation. Some of the fortifications were renovated in the 1950s, during the Cold War, and were finally abandoned by the end of the1960s. Some of the fortifications have been maintained as museums, and may be visited. Concept and organization The fortified sector was organized between World War I and World War II to counter a possible surprise attack by Italy. A portion of the garrison units were pre- positioned near the fortifications, which were to be occupied when a state of alert was declared. The organization changed over time, first during the French mobilization of August 1939, then with preparations for winter, when high-altitude positions had to be evacuated for the winter, then another deployment in the spring of 1940. French forces were dissolved in the armistice of 1940. Initial fortification efforts in the Tarentaise sector were focused on the old forts of Redoute-Ruin√©e, the Fort du Truc and the Fort de Vulmis. Later efforts focused on the creation of a series of advanced posts and more heavily-constructed ouvrages, including the petits ouvrages Cave-√†- Canon and Chatelard near Bourg St. Maurice.Mary, Tome 5, pp. 8-9 Fortification of the Maurienne valley followed a similar pattern, with advanced posts supported by the 19th century Fort du Replaton, the petit ouvrage Arrondaz and the gros ouvrages Saint-Antoine, Pas du Roc, Le Lavoir and Sapey.Mary, Tome 5, pp. 12-13 Troop units for these fortifications were extensively customized to deal with the fragmented nature of the military positions. Typical, somewhat confusingly-named units included: * Alpine Fortress Demi-Brigade (Demi-Brigade Alpin de Forteresse (DBAF) ) *Alpine Hunter Demi-Brigade (Demi-Brigade des Chasseurs Alpins (DBCA) ) * Alpine Infantry Regiment (R√©giment d'Infanterie Alpin (RIA) ) * Alpine Fortress Battalion (Battaillon Alpin de Forteresse (BAF) ) * Alpine Hunter Battalion (Bataillon des Chasseurs Alpins (BCA) ) These formations were supplemented by Position Artillery Regiments (R√©giments d'Artillerie de Position) (RAP) ), which provided mobile artillery support. A demi-brigade was similar to a large regiment, with three demi-brigades equivalent to four regiments.Mary, Tome 4, pp. 108‚Äì109 Command The Savoy sector was commanded by General Lestian until 1939, under the overall command of the Army of the Alps. A series of colonels commanded the sector from 1939 into 1940. The sector's artillery support was provided by the 164th Position Artillery Regiment ((R√©giment d'Artillerie de Position (RAP)), controlling both fixed and mobile artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel de Feydeau de Saint-Christophe, and later by Colonel Montvernay. Command was at Chamb√©ry until August 1939, after which posts moved frequently. In 1940 the sector was reinforced by the 66th Infantry Division, a class B reserve uni, under General Boucher, headquartered at St.-Jean-de-Maurienne.Mary, Tome 5, pp. 8-9 Description The sector includes the following major fortified positions, together with the most significant casemates and infantry shelters in each sub-sector: Tarentaise Valley The Tarentaise was commanded by Colonel Michet de la Baume.Mary, Tome 5, p. 8 Sub-sector Beaufortin 16th Alpine Fortress Demi-Brigade, (16e Demi-Brigade Alpin de Forteresse (DBAF)), Lt.

Late snows in the area slowed down the Italian attack, which did not start until 20 June. In Savoy, the Italian Alpine Corps attacked over the Col de la Seigne and the Little St Bernard Pass in Operation Bernardo., with the Italian 1st Corps attacking over the Mont Cenis Pass. About 5500 French troops were deployed against 50,000 Italian soldiers. . The Italian Taurinense Alpine division moved over the Col de la Seigne, stopped by sustained fire from the avant-poste of Seloges. The Trieste motorized division crossed the Little St. Bernard Pass after bombarding he Redoute-Ruin√©e post for eight hours. The initial Italian assault was stopped at the walls of the fort. Attacks continued over the next two days, then stopped until the armistice, but the avant-poste was isolated and bypassed, Italian troops moving close to Bourg-Saint-Maurice and Sainte-Foye. Redoute- Ruinƒóe was finally evacuated by French forces on 2 July.Mary, Tome 5, pp. 90-94 Total casualties in the area amounted to 9 French dead, and 72 Italian dead with more than 700 Italian wounded.Kaufmann 2011, p. 156 In the Maurienne valley, 13,000 French troops faced 40,000 Italian troops. Italian forces advanced on the Mont Cenis road and moved across the high plateau along the frontier. The Italian attack was supported by forts in the Italian Alpine Wall positions. The French La Turra outpost on the Mont Cenis road was bombarded by the Italian Fort Paradiso, but the Cagliari Division could not advance past La Turra. Other elements of the Cagliari Division tried to advance on the Little Mont Cenis Pass and entered the valley of the Arc river, but were held there by the line of avant-postes. Nearer Modane, the Superga Division crossed the Col du Fr√©jus and came under fire from ouvrages Arrondaz, Pas du Roc and Le Lavoir, backed up by covering artillery in the valley at Sapey, Saint-Antoine and Saint-Gobain. Arrondaz and Pas-du-Roc fired on Italian troops on each others' superstructures and drove them off. Italian forces made little progress against the mutually-supporting fire until the cease-fire of 25 June. Casualties were 4 French dead and 108 Italians, with 1,000 Italians wounded.Kaufmann 2011, pp. 157-159 The armistice of 24 June 1940 ended fighting, and the fortifications were occupied by Italian troops. The Fortified Sector of Savoy was dissolved by French forces in 15 July 1940.Mary, Tome 5, pp. 90-99 1944-1945 Modane was liberated on 13 September 1944, with no significant resistance from the Maginot fortifications. German forces retreated up the Mont Cenis pass, and fighting ceased until the spring of 1945. On 23 March 1945, French forces bombarded the area and advanced to Redoute-Ruin√© by 31 March. However, the fortification was not captured for another month. Fighting took place around Mont-Froid through April, until German forces abandoned Mont Cenis on 25 April.Mary, Tome 5, pp. 144-148 Present status Saint-Gobain has been preserved as a museum and may be visited.

Design and development In the late 1920s, armies underwent a worldwide trend towards mechanization in the form of tanks and light armored vehicles. This development demanded a new type of combat aircraft able to take on armored vehicles utilized by ground forces. In 1929, the Tupolev OKB undertook design of an unconventional aircraft with maximum offensive armament and armor protection. The ANT-17 was a four-seat biplane armed with a recoilless gun designed by Leonid Kurchevskiy, 8 machine guns, and over 3000 pounds of bombs. The ANT-17 would have featured over 2,000 pounds of armor. Unfortunately, the weight of the armor meant that Tupolev doubted the ability of the ANT-17 to deliver the required performance, so the ANT-17 project was cancelled.Kandalov, Paul Duffy ; Andrei (1996).

Early life  Lema√Ætre was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia and died in Nice, France. She was exiled to Paris during the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. She studied to become a painter and mosaicist in Montmartre, Rue de la Chaumi√®re.  Career  She married Andr√© Hubert Lema√Ætre, a prominent artist in fresco painting and often worked side by side with him to fulfill commissions from Parisian patrons and state orders. Their most renowned frescos include work from the church of Meudon (1927), the salon of Marechal Lyautey at the Colonial Exhibition of 1931, and at the Palace of the Golden Door (Palais de la Porte Dor√©e). During the German occupation of France in WWII, Lema√Ætre moved to the French Riviera. She worked along the coast from Cannes to Monaco painting portraits of her friends Jean Cocteau, Andre Gide, Francois Mauriac and Serge Lifar, and other French writers and artists. Ivanna Lema√Ætre was buried in a Russian cemetery in Nice, France.  Style and motifs  Lemaitre's style includes media such as mosaic, ink, oil, and watercolor. Her frequent subjects were villages and chapels in the country, views of the Mediterranean and mythology. Asian myths and religious teachings about the Buddha, Krishna, and Confucius are common motifs in her work. Her panels would include scenes from the lives of these figures along with the music, theater, and culture of the Far East. Lema√Ætre drew upon non-Christian religions little understood by the European public. She often referring to the \\"inscrutable Orient\\" in her paintings. She incorporated images of the primordial elements fire, water, and earth, all celebrated in Asian beliefs. Frescoes by the Lema√Ætres showcased a pantheon of oriental figures on the walls which gave the contributions of the Far East a full, relatively accurate description compared to the Orientalist conventions adopted by painters such as Delacroix, Ingres, and Renoir. The Lema√Ætres sought to present Eastern religion without the typical, exotic symbols or excessive stylization of Art Deco.

A small shrub bearing attractive blue-purple or mauve pea flowers from August to November. Description Hovea rosmarinifolia is a shrub to high. The stems and branches are thickly covered in brownish coloured soft hairs that may be wrinkled, curly or straight. Leaves are long and narrow long and wide either rounded or squared at the apex. The leaves are a deep green above, paler on the underside and arch downward on either side of the midrib. The surface is either smooth or sparsely covered in rough hairs with a network of prominent raised veins. The leaf underside has curled or wrinkled brownish hairs completely covering the leaf blade.

The flower bracts are egg-shaped to narrowly egg- shaped long. The sepals are long, the mauve petals at the back of the flower long and similarly as wide. The mauve keel is shorter than the petals of the flower. Flowers appear from August to November followed by egg-shaped seed pods long that are densely covered in rusty coloured soft hairs. Taxonomy and naming Hovea rosmarinifolia was first formally described by Allan Cunningham in 1825 and published in Geographical Memoirs of New South Wales.

This caused protests across Japan that ranged in size to up to 20,000 civilians. The majority of the protests were concentrated on the streets of Osaka and Kobe, the capital of Hyogo Prefecture, where civilians protested the closure of the Korean schools. Hanshin, the location of many of the demonstrations, is the region that lies between Osaka and Kobe. The protestors stormed the Hyogo Prefecture Office Building, and held the governor, the prefectural police chief, and officers of the Allied Occupation as hostages in an attempt to coerce them to rescind their decision to close the Korean ethnic school. While an agreement was briefly agreed upon, the Japanese and the U.S. government broke the deal, declared a state of emergency in Hyogo, and arrested thousands of Koreans living throughout the city. The schools had been used by Koreans living in Japan (also known as Zainichi) to maintain their Korean heritage, through Korean language education. However, the fear that communists had infiltrated the schools and were attempting to disrupt the U.S. occupation of the region prompted the closure of the schools. In the 1950s, Koreans living in Japan were able to preserve the existence of Korean ethnic schools through privatization, distancing themselves from the Japanese Communist Party and by establishing Chongryon and Mindan, Zainichi organizations which are supported by the North Korean and South Korean governments, respectively.  Background  Teacher at a Korean ethnic school in Japan (1945-1949)  Japanese occupation of Korea  Korea went through a period of Japanese occupation from 1910 until 1945, starting with the Japan - Korea Treaty of 1910, which integrated Korea into the Japanese Empire as a protectorate. In 1938, the Japanese government adopted a policy that aimed to assimilate Koreans by replacing Korean language education with Japanese language education. By 1943, speaking Korean was forbidden. Despite resistance, many Koreans also adopted Japanese names, in hopes of improving their opportunities and avoiding discrimination. Those who did not comply with the policy were forbidden from attending school, collecting wartime rations or working for the government.  Creation of Korean ethnic schools  Following World War Two, the Japanese Empire collapsed and Korea gained independence. There was a significant Korean population (approximately 725,000) living in Japan at the time, and the majority were not able to practice Korean traditions under Japanese Imperial rule. After independence, Korean ethnic schools (known as minzoku kyoiku) were created in Japan to cater to the educational needs of the Korean minority that remained in Japan. The movement to create Korean schools was created by the League of Koreans, an organization that represented the interests of Koreans living in Japan. The League's aim was to preserve Korean culture among the minority inhabiting Japan. As many of the children who attended the schools were not fluent in Korean, the schools' mandate was to reconnect Korean children with their ethnic language and to facilitate a smooth transition, should they decide to return to Korea.  The School Education Law  Dai-Ichi Seimei Building, the former headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur during the occupation of Japan following World War II|alt= The Korean ethnic schools in Japan were largely supported by the Communist Party of Japan. This was unacceptable to the Allied forces that were occupying Japan, as it was the beginning of the \\"Cold War with communism.\\" The threat of an outbreak of a Korean civil war also caused the Allied forces to decide that ethnic schools must be closed, in order to curb any growth in communism within the region. In 1947, the School Education Law was enacted in Japan under the instruction of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Forces Douglas MacArthur.‚ÄúEthnic education efforts ¬∑ Handling in public education in Japan.‚Äù Voice of Identity, kogitsune.club/voice-of-identity/Ê∞ëÊóèÊïôËÇ≤Âπ¥Ë°®. This required all schools in Japan to be accredited by the state and made Japanese the only official language of instruction. Korean could only be used for extracurricular activities. Since the ethnic schools did not comply with these regulations, General MacArthur instructed that all the Korean schools be shut down. As a result of the 1947 School Education Law, the Governor of Hyogo Prefecture ordered all Korean ethnic schools to close down on April 10, 1948.Hyogo Prefectural Police Headquarters. Hyogo Prefectural Police History. Showa edition. Hy≈çgo Prefect. Police Headquarter, 1975. Thirteen days later, on April 23, Japanese police and military used force to close down schools by physically removing students and nailing the doors shut.Osaka Municipal Administration Bureau. Osaka City Police Magazine. 1956. The police and military then blocked the entrance to Nada and Higashi schools to prevent students from entering.  Protests  Protests during the Hanshin Education Incident  Osaka Prefecture  The protests were held all over Japan, with one of the biggest occurring in Osaka, where over 7,000 were in attendance. On April 23, 1948, a crowd gathered outside of the Osaka Castle, where sixteen people were chosen to be representatives to negotiate with the Governor about the closure of the ethnic schools, and to discuss the general attitudes towards Koreans and Korean education in Osaka. When no agreements were reached, nearly 4,000 protestors forcefully entered the central office of the Osaka Prefecture Government, destroying office equipment and cutting phone lines. The Governor of Osaka, with whom they had hoped to negotiate, escaped the office with the assistance of a police escort. Over the next few days, the protests grew in number to between 20,000 and 40,000 protestors. These protests, which were mostly centralized at Otemae Park in Osaka, were dispersed by the military. A Korean teenager named Kim T'ae-il, the only recorded casualty from the Hanshin Education Incident, was killed when Japanese police were shooting among the crowd of protestors.  Hyogo Prefecture  Hyogo Prefecture was also a centre for the protests. On the morning of April 24, almost 3,000 Koreans and Japanese Communist Party members protested in front of the Hyogo Prefecture Government Building in an attempt to get the government to re-open the schools and release the 70 Koreans who had been previously arrested. About 100 Korean protestors broke into the reception of the Governor's office, where they destroyed furniture and cut off the phone lines, which limited communication with the police and military. The protestors also broke down the wall to the Governor's office, where the protestors kept the Governor, the Mayor of Kobe and the Chief of Police hostage until the release of the arrested Korean protestors was guaranteed. The 70 prisoners were released, and a verbal guarantee of the retraction of the school closure order was made. That evening, a state of emergency was declared in Hyogo, and the U.S. Military took over the security situation. The promises that the Governor had made became null and void, as the Governor made them while under duress. On April 25, the US military police, together with the Japanese police, arrested thousands more of the protestors and alleged leaders of the League of Koreans. The state of emergency was lifted the next day and, by April 29, 1,732 people had been arrested. Seven people were tried by the US Military Commission and sentenced to hard labor for 10 to 15 years because they perpetrated ‚Äúharmful acts against the safety and occupation purpose of occupation troops in Japan.‚Äù  Immediate aftermath   Temporary closure and privatization of Korean schools  In Hyogo Prefecture, the government closed the Korean ethnic schools and forced students to transfer to the local Japanese schools. These actions resulted in the closure of most of the 337 schools that were administered by the League of Koreans. By 1952, 157 Korean ethnic schools were still in operation in Japan. As a result of the protests, the Eighth Army General Officer Robert Eichelberger ordered Kobe police to go on a ‚ÄúKorean Hunt‚Äù that aimed to arrest anyone who looked Korean. Following the end of the Korean War, the Japanese Koreans approached the issue of ethnic schools by working within the Japanese legal system. This approach was successful, as the Koreans living in Japan moved away from the Japanese Communist Party, and instead started to fund the ethnic Korean schools privately, or with the support from Chongryon and Mindan, Zainichi organizations supported by the North Korean and South Korean governments, respectively.  Split from the Japanese Communist Party  During the Hanshin protests in Osaka-Kobe, the Zainichi civil rights movement relied on support from the Japan Communist Party, but with the end of the Korean War, ethnic Korean activists moved away from an anti-Japanese stance and attempted to depoliticize their movement and severe ties with the Communist Party in Japan. Not all ethnic Koreans aligned with the communist ideology of the movement and a split within the Zainichi movement occurred when the South Korean Association in Japan (Mindan) was founded in 1948.  Long-term effects   Discrimination  The Hanshin Education Incident is part of a larger struggle for civil rights, autonomy and acceptance of Koreans living in Japan. The Zainichi (Koreans residing in Japan) had been discriminated against based on their ethnicity during Japanese Imperial Rule. Following the defeat and Allied occupation of Japan, ethnic Koreans were deemed to be aliens in Japan by the 1947 Alien Registration Law. This law required all those living in Japan who were ethnically Korean to register for alien status. In 1950, the Nationality Law made it so that Koreans were only allowed to gain citizenship if their father was Japanese. Those born to Japanese mothers and Korean fathers were stripped of their Japanese citizenship. Successive anti-Korean laws impeded ethnic Koreans' ability to seek employment in professions that were deemed to be ‚ÄúJapanese professions,\\" which included the majority of public and private sector work. As a result, a large number of Koreans began to work in alcohol production and scrap recycling, or engage in criminal activity. Many Japanese Koreans graduates were not able to find work due to their Korean heritage. A 1955 law forced all Koreans to be fingerprinted, as they were considered to be foreigners living in Japan. Up to the early 1980s, Koreans living in Japan faced unequal treatment in regards to public services, as many Japanese Korean seniors were denied pensions on the basis of their Korean ethnicity. These policies led to a growth in Korean resentment towards the Allied occupation and the post-war Japanese government.  Establishment of Chongryon and Mindan  In 1955, the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) was founded, and became the primary organization for Koreans aligned with North Korea. This Association had close ties to the newly-established Communist government of North Korea which financially and ideologically supported the preservation of Korean ethnic schools. Mindan is the other major organization for Koreans living in Japan, but is primarily aligned with South Korea. Both organisations currently maintain multiple educational institutions in Japan such as Chongryon's Ch≈çsen gakk≈ç. Both Mindan and Chongryon engage and promote Korean nationalism in Japan. North Korea supports Chongryon in return for the US$100 million that Chongryon sends annually to North Korea. alt=  Reforms  In the 1980s the situation began to improve for ethnic Koreans in Japan. There were educational reforms in Japan which allowed Korean schools to maintain their status as private educational institutions, with some in operation up to this day. By 1987, naturalized Koreans living in Japan became able to use their Korean name, rather than a Japanese name. When Japan signed the United Nations Refugee Convention, Chongryon Koreans received permanent residency status too and were granted the right to visit their families in North Korea. Nearly the entire population of ethnic Koreans living in Japan had been granted permanent residency by 1991. The law that required the fingerprinting of permanent residents was terminated in 1993.  Recent history   1990s  North Korea's engagement with Chongryon continued on into the 1990s. At the time, Japan was going through a recession and there was a revival in Japanese nationalism that perceived Chongryon as a national security threat. The rise of Japanese neo-nationalism caused a renewed deterioration of relations with the Koreans living in Japan. The Japanese government started to monitor the Chongryon affiliated schools more closely, including their educational curriculum and their financial ties, as they had been sending monetary aid to North Korea. By 1999, 90% of Korean children in Japan received their education in a Japanese school.  Present  After Shinzo Abe was elected Prime Minister in 2012, his government decided that Chongryon schools‚Äô freedom of operation had to be curtailed by cancelling subsidies that improved affordability for the pro-Chongryon ethnic Koreans. In 2017, the District Court of Osaka ruled that the attempted cuts to school subsidies by the Abe government should de retracted. One year later, the Japanese High Court upheld the government's decision to restrict educational subsidies for students attending Chongryon schools.

He was the first Hebrew writer to deal in detail with the newly-discovered Americas. Biography Abraham ben Mordecai Farissol was born in Avignon, where his family had lived for at least a century. Soon after 1468 Farissol went to Mantua, where he worked for Judah ben Yehiel Messer Leon as a scribe. He went to Ferrara in 1473, where he acted as hazzan in the synagogue, and occupied himself besides in the copying of manuscripts. Farissol immersed himself in Renaissance life revolving around the enlightened court of Ercole d'Este I, Duke of Ferrara. He was also attendant at the court of Lorenzo de' Medici, where his interest in traveller's tales and discovery was whetted. Work Women's prayer books Birkot hashachar in a woman's machzor by Farissol (1471) In 1471 and 1480 Farrisol published two women's prayer books, notable for replacing the traditional prayer in the Birkot hashachar recited by women, \\"Blessed are You, Lord our God, Master of Universe for creating me according to Your Will,\\" with \\"Blessed are You Lord our God, Master of the Universe, for You made me a woman and not a man\\" (). The 1480 book was donated to the National Library of Israel in 1973. Biblical commentary and translations Abraham Farissol wrote a short commentary to the Torah under the title of Pir·∏•e Shoshannim (), and later published a commentary to Job, which includes a study on the location of the Land of Uz (in Biblia Rabbinica, Venice, 1518). In 1525 Farissol wrote a commentary to Ecclesiastes. He also translated into Hebrew Aristotle's Logic and the compendium of Porphyry. Some sermons of Farissol's, and a number of letters which he wrote in 1468 and 1474 to several of his contemporaries, are also extant. Magen Avraham Farissol wrote a polemical work under the title of Magen Avraham (), or Vikkua·∏• ha-Dat (), in three parts, the second against Christianity, the third against Islam. He was induced to write this work by the fact that he was chosen to represent Judaism at the court of d'Este in a disputation with two Dominican monks. By order of the duke he also made a r√©sum√© in Italian of the Hebrew text, so that his antagonists might understand his position. The work was largely based on Simeon ben Zemah Duran's Keshet u-Magen. Iggeret Or·∏•ot 'Olam Copy of a Latin translation of the Iggeret (Oxford, 1691). The most important of his writings is the Iggeret Or·∏•ot 'Olam () (Ferrara, 1524; Venice, 1587), a cosmographic and geographic work based upon original research as well as the works of Christian and Arab geographers, especially Bergomas' Supplementum, Amerigo's Cosmographia, and Fracanzano da Montalboddo's Paesi novamente retrovati e nova mundo da Alberico Vesputio riorentino intitulato. Each of the treatise's thirty chapters deals with a certain geographical area or subject, and many cosmological and historical matters are also treated. The book contains accounts of the newly discovered parts of the world, the new Portuguese sea route to India, the Ten Tribes, David Reuveni, and the condition of the Jews in various parts of the world. It includes descriptions of the Amerindians, emphasizing their sexual practices, social organization, lack of property, health, the richness of their wildlife, and their wealth in gems and metals. Farissol also used a combination of textual evidence with geographic and climatic evidence to determine the location of the Garden of Eden. The Iggeret was translated into Latin by Bodleian librarian Thomas Hyde under the title of \\"Tractatus Itinerum Mundi\\" (Oxford, 1691).

The monastery is situated on an outcrop overlooking the Dom Lu√≠s I Bridge and the historic centre of Porto. Together with these locations, the monastery was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The monastery is notable for its church and cloister, both of which are circular. Site The Monastery of Serra do Pilar is located in the parish of Santa Marinha e S√£o Pedro da Afurada in the historic centre of Vila Nova de Gaia. The monastery is prominently situated high above the Doura and can be accessed by Jardim do Morro Station on the Porto Metro's D Line. History View of the monastery from Porto Construction of the first monastery at the site began in 1538 by the Order of St. Augustine. The initiative dates back to 1527 under the orders of Jo√£o III to serve as a larger monastic residence for monks from the , in Grij√≥, which had been in a state of deterioration. The original monastery was completed in 1564 and the cloisters were finished in 1583. The first monastery was quickly rendered obsolete as the facilities were too small for the number of monks in residence. In 1597, work began on the new church and the monastery was slowly updated in phases over the next several decades. The new circular church was inaugurated on July 17, 1672, and the final phases of the monastery were completed by the end of the 17th century. Serra do Pilar's military importance first became evidenced during the Peninsular War when it was used by General Arthur Wellesley to launch a surprise attack on the French across the Douro, and retake Porto. The monastery's prominent location acted as the only Liberal stronghold on the south side of the Douro during the Siege of Porto. The monastery was fortified over the course of the 19th century to take advantage of its strategic location. In 1910 the site was declared a National Monument of Portugal. Reconstruction of portions of the monastery that had been destroyed by successive wars began in 1927. In 1947 some of the monastery grounds were converted into a military barracks which remains on the site to this day. Since the late 20th century the monastery and grounds have been open to the public and the church continues to hold Sunday Mass. The monastery was included in the 1996 UNESCO World Heritage Site designation of Porto's historic centre. Architecture The Monastery of Serra do Pilar's unique design is influenced by Renaissance and Mannerist elements. The church and cloister are both circular with identical diameters. The church in the west and the cloister in the east are separated by a rectangular choir and chapel. The north wing of the monastery houses the bell tower and dormitories and the south wing houses the sacristy and refectory. The -tall church is the most visible structure of the monastery, dominating the skyline on the south side of the Douro and towering over the -tall bell tower. The Church of Serra do Pilar is one of a number of round churches in Western Europe.

East Slavic culture arose from Slavic, Uralic, Germanic (Vikings) and Turkic peoples and was influenced by eastern and western cultures from Asia and Europe, mainly from Scandinavia and Baltic regions, as well as from nomadic Eurasian steppe cultures. The squat dance originated in regions where Eastern Slavic people lived (and later where Russian, Belarus and Ukrainian states appeared in Europe, formerly Kievan Rus'). Beside East Slavic-speaking countries squat dancing is also used to some degree in Indian dances. The squat dance is an integral feature of Russian folk culture. With kicks in the air, turns, and stomping movements, it is one of the main elements in Russian fast dances. The squat dance appears in Russian dances such as Barynya, Leto, Kalinka, Yablochko, Trepak, Kozachok and others. The squat dance is performed only by males. While dancers squat with folded arms, they kick their legs, alternating between high and low kicks. Accelerating the legs and walking while squatting is common. Some dancers squat with their feet on the ground while others stay on their toes. The dance demands tight muscles and good balance. History Squat dance mainly developed out of the culture of the eastern Slavs. In Old Russian villages there were contests of dancers held. People bet and typed which dancers will win. The winner either received a material gift or money and the gifts were then shared with the crew. The Squat dance existed in Old Russia as a dance and as a fighting dance.

He was a lifelong professor of Tongji University and the founding director of the university's Institute of High-tech Building Technology. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1999. He emphasized the use of local and natural materials in his designs, and summarized his design philosophy as \\"modern bones, traditional soul, and natural clothing\\". Over a career spanning more than 50 years, Dai and his wife Wu Lusheng designed about 100 projects together.  Early life and education  Dai was born on 25 April 1928 in Guangzhou, Guangdong, Republic of China, with his ancestral home in Wuwei, Anhui. He was the eldest son of Kuomintang general Dai Anlan and his wife Wang Hexin (). When he was 13, his father died in the Burma Campaign of World War II, and his mother donated the entire death benefit of Fabi $200,000 she received from the government to build the Anlan Memorial School in Quanzhou, Guangxi. The family later fell into financial difficulty as Wang raised four children on her own. Although Dai Fudong was interested in painting, he decided to study architecture so he could support the family. Dai studied at Tsinghua High School in Guiyang, where many of China's top scholars took refuge during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1948, he entered the Department of Architecture of National Central University (now Southeast University School of Architecture). After graduating in 1952, he was assigned by the new Communist government to teach at Tongji University in Shanghai, and spent his entire career there. His classmate Wu Lusheng was also assigned to Tongji, and they married the following year.  Early career: designing Mao's Villa  In 1958, Dai, Wu, and their colleague Fu Xinqi were appointed co- designers of the Meiling () Guesthouse at the East Lake in Wuhan. Halfway through the project, they were invited to watch a performance with Mao Zedong, and were told that the guesthouse would be Mao's personal villa in Wuhan. Mao spent much of his later years at Meiling; Dai and Wu did not see the completed building until 1978, when it was opened to the public as a tourist attraction after Mao's death.  Life in the United States  In 1983, Dai went to Columbia University in the United States as a visiting scholar. The next year, the Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei, who had just won the Pritzker Prize, used the prize money to establish a scholarship for Chinese architects, and Dai was chosen as the first recipient. He spent the $2,000 scholarship travelling around the United States by Greyhound Bus, visiting 32 cities. While in the US, Dai wrote President Ronald Reagan to request a reissue of the Legion of Merit medal awarded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to his father Dai Anlan, which had been destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Having no contact in the US government, he simply addressed the letter to \\"President Reagan, White House, Washington DC\\". To his surprise, the US Army responded on behalf of the president and reissued the medal accompanied with a certificate. He later donated the medal and the certificate to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution.  Later career and works  Over a career spanning more than half a century, Dai and his wife Wu Lusheng designed about 100 projects together. They specialized in small and medium-sized buildings including offices, hotels, and university buildings. They emphasized the use of local materials, strove to utilize limited resources for the maximum benefit, and focused on human comfort and artistic value. He summarized his design philosophy as \\"modern bones, traditional soul, and natural clothing\\" (Áé∞‰ª£È™®„ÄÅ‰º†ÁªüÈ≠Ç„ÄÅËá™ÁÑ∂Ë°£). In an interview with Chinese media, Wu stated that Dai mainly focused on the overall design, and she on the detailed execution. In 1988, Dai and Wu designed the architecture school of Tongji University in 1988. At the time Chinese universities were poorly financed; they were given a budget of only US$570,000 for the building. The building was well received, and they were subsequently commissioned to design the university's Run Run Shaw Building and the Graduate School Building. In 1992‚Äì1993, Dai and Wu designed the Big Dipper Mountain Village, a small hotel on the Shandong Peninsula with seven buildings. The buildings had modern interiors, but externally they were covered with local stones and roofs were covered with seaweed, a material used by local farmers for the roofs of their houses, and the pathways were paved with local pebbles with grass planted among them. Their design minimized the cost while giving the hotel a distinct local flavour. They also applied the same design philosophy to the International Hotel in Zunhua. Dai founded the Institute of High-tech Building Technology at Tongji University to develop lightweight and sustainable construction materials, and served as its first director. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 1999. In August 2006, he was conferred the Lifetime Achievement Award by the China Creative Studies Institute. Dai published seven books, 107 research papers, and a translated book. He also held two patents.  Death  On 25 February 2018, Dai Fudong died at Xinhua Hospital in Shanghai, at the age of 89.

He is one of the most respected contemporary tattooists in Japan. Biography Horiyasu, otherwise known as Asakusa Horiyasu, was a samurai- sword smith. He started working with blades at the age of 20 and mastered the craft for 16 years in Iwate Prefecture. He got his first tattoo at the age of 21. Horiyasu turned to tattooing at the age of 36. He learned by studying works of such Ukiyo-e artists as Utagawa Kuniyoshi, Tsukioka Yoshitoshi and Katsushika Hokusai. In a 2013 Skin Deep Magazine interview he recalled that at first he didn't know anything and learned by watching an older horishi in Morioka. At first he was doing tattoos by hand (tebori), but learned how to work with the tattoo machine from Gifu Horihiro. In an interview with Tattoo Master magazine he acknowledged that ‚Äúthe edge of the sword teeth, the tattoo needle point‚Ä¶ the parallels in the tactile sensation when one makes swords, and when one tattoos‚Äù. Unlike some of the traditional masters who will only accept clients by introduction, he became known for working with foreigners. In 2004, he travelled to New York to take part in the New York Tattoo Convention, where he won two top prizes. In the following years he took part in various tattoo conventions around the world, including conventions in New York, Milan, San Jose, China and Taiwan. In 2011, Horiyasu's works were featured in BloodWork: Bodies, a limited edition book series showing works of 53 of the best masters from all over the world, published by Analog Tattoo Arts Kolectiv. Style Horiyasu executes only large-scale pieces. His style is described as bold and striking. He is mainly focused on traditional tattooing themes such as Buddhist deities, dragons, tigers, samurai warriors, historical protective personalities, water and floral motifs (such as goldfish and peonies or carps), working mostly for male clients. Horiyasu often uses vivid colors that radiate from the skin. He is also known for using colors of the darker end of the spectrum, which create a heavy opacity. Despite his use of traditional imagery, Horiyasu uses a tattoo machine rather than the tebori needles. In a 2013 interview with Japanese tattoo artist Genko for Tattoo Society magazine he recalled that for the first year he worked with tebori needles and it wasn't practical so he switched to an Ed Hardy Magnetic machine. Some time around 2011 he started using a coil machine. Horiyasu also explained that machines allow ‚Äúan infinite number of settings, research and techniques.‚Äù He thinks that working with the machine is not only quicker but also inflicts less amount of pain. Awards  Horiyasu has participated in various tattoo conventions and competitions such as the New York Tattoo Convention, where he received first place for ‚ÄúBest Overall‚Äù in 2007 as well as first place for ‚ÄúBest Chest or Back‚Äù. Also in 2007, he won three first place awards at the Milan Tattoo Convention and first place ‚ÄúBest Bodysuit‚Äù at the San Jose Tattoo Convention. In 2013, he won first prize for the \\"Best Back Piece or Full Body\\" nomination at the Mondial du Tatouage Paris Tattoo Convention and won first place for \\"Best Color\\" and \\"Best Overall\\" at the first Hong Kong China Tattoo Convention.

Ashok Mahto and his gang were responsible for the killing of a sitting Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha), Rajo Singh, in 2005. Although Ashok Mahto was imprisoned , he escaped from Nawada jail in 2002. Pintu Mahto killed three policemen during the prison break. The leaders of the gang are said to be belonging to either Kurmi or the Koeri Caste. But , it was supported by all the backward castes in the Nawada and Sheikhpura region as Mahto gang was in a war of retribution with the upper caste Bhumihars who were exploitative. Mahto and his gang were responsible for the assassination of a large number of Forward Caste people in late 90s.  Mahto - Singh rivalry  The rivalry between Mahto and another gangster Akhilesh Singh affected over 100 villages in the Nawada, Nalanda and Sheikhpura districts of Bihar. Between 1998 and 2006, the war which claimed over 200 lives in Nawada district alone, stemmed from caste conflict between the Bhumihars and Koeris.^ Bihar‚Äôs Koeris joined hands with their once-bitter enemies, the land-owning Bhumihars, a group of upper- castes with whom they has been engaged in battles in Nitish Kumar‚Äôs own Nalanda district (besides Nawada and Sheikhpura) under the leadership of Ashok Mahto. The clash between the two groups would decide power over the \\"stone-crushing\\" and \\"sand lifting\\" arrangements in the areas of rivalry.In 2003, the Mahto gang allegedly killed the father of a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), Aruna Devi (wife of Akhilesh Singh), and five others, including a six-year-old boy. It was reported that the killings were in retaliation for the deaths of seven labourers allegedly by the Akhilesh Singh gang. In 2000 they attacked the same MLA's house and killed over 12 people. The Mahto-Singh rivalry was not merely a rivalry between two gangs for supremacy but the mobilisation of castes in support of each of these two gangs was also taking place. During 2005 elections Aruna Devi, the wife of Akhilesh Singh was one of the candidate for legislative assembly elections from the region on the ticket of Lok Janshakti Party. According to one of her supporter, all the charges of murders and abductions upon Akhilesh Singh were frivolous and he had just taken up the arms to fight for the honour of his community i.e upper caste Bhumihars. Similarly, Ashok Mahto and his men were said to have taken over the responsibility to protect the rights of downtrodden Koeri community as well as other backward castes. Aruna Devi also faced opposition from Pradeep Mahto, a friend of Ashok Mahto, who also had several charges against him. Ashok Mahto was also responsible for killing a large number of upper caste people in the area which was famous for Sand mining and Potato cultivation. Arrests and trial The Ashok Mahto gang consisted of gangsters such as Pintu Mahto , who had nearly thirty cases of murder and kidnapping to his name, including the murder of three policemen and Congress politician Rajo Singh. Pintu Mahto was responsible for the Ashok Mahto gang in areas of Nawada district such as Warisaliganj and Sheikhpura. Besides this the Mahto gang also included the members like Sharda Yadav , who was convicted in massacre of 11 upper caste people at the Apshar village and was also convicted of loots and abduction. He was arrested in 2003 along with 9 other aides. \\"Ariyari\\" Police also got success in arresting Bacchu Mahto, the sharpshooter of Mahto gang. Ashok Mahto himself was finally arrested in 2006, while he was on the way to court, the Bihar Police Special authority police(SAP) officers carried out a procession in which half naked Mahto was dressed in garland of slippers with blood coming out of his lips. This incident sparked controversy and the backward castes of the region saw it as a punishment to the gangster which was meted out to him bacause of his dare to stand upto Bhumihars. Mahto enjoyed considerable support among backwards and thus his public humiliation aroused questions that can the Police humiliate an upper caste gangster in a similar manner. After his attendance in the court, Supritendent of Police Amit lodha claimed that Mahto had made a confession of his involvement in Rajo Singh murder case. Mahto however also claimed of his linkage with JD(U) leader Rajeev Ranjan Singh or Lalan Singh. Meanwhile, he also pointed out towards his close ties with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. These claims were not taken seriously by the Court and the Police. The opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal and Lok Janshakti Party pressed for CBI enquiry in the whole issue and asked Lalan Singh to resign. The Chief Minister himself was under pressure from the opposition. In 2013, a court of Sheikhpura cleared Ashok Mahto , Shambhu Yadav and Anil Mahto in Rajo Singh murder case. All these were convicted for the murder of erstwhile Congress leader of Sheikhpura but in the absence of evidence they were cleared.Presently, Ashok Mahto is incarcerated in Nawada jail. In popular culture  Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Amit Lodha was posted in Sheikhpura during the time of the arrest of Pintu Mahto. In 2018 he penned a book Bihar Diaries that doesn't name anyone directly, but media reports match the story to the life of Pintu Mahto.

Ministry on the Western Cape  Hahn trained as a lay brother and farmer with the Rhenish Missionary Institute in Elberfeld-Barmen, and in 1834 he was dispatched to the Ebenhaeser mission, where in 1839 he would found the congregation now known as the Ebenezer Uniting Reformed Church on the banks of the Olifantsriver (Western Cape), helping foster the impoverished Khoikhoi settlement there. He built a church, two homes and barns, a windmill, and a water pump, and cultivated lay gardens and fields, all the while educating Khoikhoi on Western agricultural techniques. However, he could not sustain an agrarian lifestyle among the villagers in the drought-stricken region.  In South West Africa  Many towns in central and southern were founded by the Rhenish Missionaries, including Berseba, with the help of Hahn By the time he was replaced by Norwegian missionary Hans Christian Knudsen in Bethanie north of the Orange River, Hahn's health was already failing him. Because he realized missionary work could only proceed in cohesive communities, he continued trying to make settled farmers of the nomadic Khoikhoi (Nama), and cultivated fields around Kubis and Oas on the Orange River banks with the help of the San people. For the first time in South West Africa's history, then, Hahn brought two plows to break the soil at the foot of Brukkaros Mountain, an extinct volcano. The fields were left fallow eventually, however, and Hahn was ordained to prioritize missionary work instead. David Christiaan's slow going in Bethanie, gave him little hope, but Paul Goliat's work among the Oorlam people at the nearby Gulbrandsdalen station seemed more promising. When water scarcity drove him out, he started the Berseba mission under Brukkaros, but illness brought on by the brutal conditions compounded his difficulty learning the Nama language.  Return to Germany and South Africa  Accepting his emeritus degree in 1851, Hahn returned with his family to Barmen in 1852, serving the missionaries as an itinerant preacher in Germany until 1875. He then returned to South Africa until his death in Stellenbosch.  Personal life  Hahn married Helene Langenbeck from Barmen, having seven children together. His oldest son, Johannes Hahn, was headmaster of the Rhenish Missionary school in Stellenbosch (from whence the Rhenish Girls' High School sprang), and another of his sons was Johannes Theophilus Hahn (a merchant, linguist, and librarian), and the youngest was Paul Daniel Hahn, chemistry professor at the South African College in Cape Town.

They are related to the administration of land and other First Nation assets by the government of Canada, or breaches from treaty obligations or of any other agreements between first nations and the Crown by the government of Canada. They can also involve mismanagement of indigenous land or assets by the Crown under the Indian Act. They are based on lawful obligations of the Crown toward the First Nations, and first nations cannot use aboriginal titles or punitive damages as the basis of their claims. The government of Canada typically resolves specific claims by negotiating a monetary compensation for the breach with the band government, and in exchange, they require the extinguishment of the First Nation's rights to the land in question. The Canadian government started recognizing indigenous specific claims in 1973, and negotiating for their settlement. Since then, 1844 claims have been submitted by First Nation communities. 935 of them have been resolved, and 462 of them are currently being studied or are in negotiations. In 2008, an independent judicial body, the Specific Claims Tribunal was created to give binding decisions to resolve the claims that were not accepted for negotiations, or claims where both parties couldn't agree on a fair compensation.  Background  Relations between Indigenous peoples and European colonists have been characterized by breaches in the engagements the colonists made toward the First Nations. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 established that, from than point onward, only the British Crown could engage in treaties or agreements with the First Nations. These agreements include the peace and friendship treaties in the Maritimes, the 11 numbered treaties with the First Nations of part of Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories, and many other regional treaties in southern Ontario and British Columbia. However, sometimes, the land promised by the treaties were never allocated. Other times, the government of Canada made illegal sessions of the land under the Indian Act, or employees at the Department of Indian Affairs fraudulently sold or leased reserve land for their own interests. In other cases, Indigenous groups were inadequately compensated for the sale or damage of reserve lands. The current Indigenous specific claims originate from these outstanding treaty obligations.  History of specific claims  Some first nation communities started to press their claims from the 19th and early 20th century. However, from 1927 to 1951, prosecuting indigenous land claims in court and using band funds to sue the federal government was prohibited, which left land claims largely ignored. In 1947, a parliamentary committee recommended that Canada create a \\"Claims Commission\\" similar to the Indian Claims Commission in the United States, which was created two years prior in 1945. It was again recommended in 1959-1961 that Canada investigate land grievances of First Nations in British Columbia and in Kanesatake, Quebec. Canada started accepting specific claims for negotiations in 1973. A federal policy created the Office of Native Claims within the department of Indian and Northern Affairs to negotiate indigenous land claims. The policy also divided in these claims into two categories: comprehensive claims and specific claims. Comprehensive claims deal with the rights of indigenous people to their ancestral lands for traditional use. Specific claim, on the other hand, deal with specific instances breaches of the government's obligations toward indigenous communities. In 1982, nine years after the creation of the Office of Native Claims, only 12 out of the 250 claims filed with the government had been settled. Indigenous communities criticised the fact that the Office of Native Claims in Indian and Northern Affairs Canada was both evaluating and negotiating each claim, thus creating a conflict of interests. They instead called for the negotiation process to be run by an independent body. In 1992, the government of Canada created to Office of the Indian Claims Commissioner, whose job was to investigate claims that were refused for negotiations by the Office of Native Claims. However, the claims commissioners' powers were limited to issuing non-binding resolutions and thus was ineffective. In their annual reports, the claims commissioners often suggest the creation of a new independent body to oversee specific claims, which could impose binding resolutions on claims where Canada and the first nations cannot agree on fair compensation. This body came into existence in 2008, with the creation of the Specific Claims Tribunal, where independent Jurors assess the claims on a case-by-case basis.  Specific claims process  First Nation communities can start the specific claims process by submitting a claim to the federal government. These claims must meet the minimum standards for specific claims submissions as set out by the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations, or they are immediately rejected, and must be filed again. If a claim meets these requirements, it enters a 3-year assessment period, where the government determines whether a breach has occurred or not. If the government determines there was no breach, the file is closed, and the first nation may modify their claim and re-submit it, or challenge the government's assessment in the Specific Claims Tribunal. When the claim is accepted for negotiations starts a 3-year timeframe for the negotiation period, where the government and the first nation try to agree on a fair compensation for the breach. The compensation is usually a monetary compensation, and does not typically include added land for the reserve. If no agreement is reached, the First Nation may submit their claim to litigation with the Specific Claims Tribunal.  Ongoing claims  Here are examples of a few ongoing specific claims:  Atikamekw of Opitciwan  The Atikamekw of Opiticiwan filed four distinctive specific claims with the federal government, one related to the losses incurred by the flooding of their village in 1918 due to the construction of the La Loutre Dam and the Gouin Reservoir, one related to the delay in the creation of the reserve, one related to the size of the reserve, and a last one related to the raising of the dam which led to other floods in the 1940s and 1950s. Map of the planned Indian Reserve of Obijuan (Obedjiwan) in 1914 In 1912, the Chief Gabriel Awashish and his band of over 150 Atikameks settled on the land of present-day Obeydjiwan, on the coast of a lake of the same name. The area was surveyed in 1914 by surveyor Walter Russel White, in preparation for the creation of a reserve in the Area. The band was promised for this reserve, but White surveyed only of land. In 2016, the Specific Claims Tribunal ruled that the Crown made no serious efforts to give the first nation the 3000-acre reserve, and therefore should compensate the First nation for the missing. In 1918, the end of the construction of the La Loutre dam resulted in a flooding destroyed the village of Obeydjiwan, including all of the band's houses and possessions. As early as 1912, the federal government knew that the dam would flood the village, yet they did not notify the band. The compensations for these damages was delayed, and the some Atikamekw were not properly compensated, or not at all. The reserve of Obeydjiwan was finally created in 1950. The 1950 reserve was 2,290 acres, and included land outside of the area proposed for the reserve in 1914 to compensate for the land that had been flooded in 1918. In 2016, the Specific Claims tribunal ruled that the delay for the creation of the reserve was too long, which resulted in loss of income from logging for the Atikamekw. In 2013, Canadian surveyor √âric Groulx testified in front of the Specific Claims Tribunal that surveyor W.R. White miscalculated the area of the land he surveyed in 1914, stating that the land surveyed had an area of as opposed to 2,290 as was previously calculated. This error resulted in further errors when calculating the area of the land that was flooded in 1918, which was used to add land outside of the proposed reserve. The Specific Claims Tribunal therefore ruled that the First Nation was not properly compensated for the land lost in the flooding.  Kanesatake  The Kanesatake land claim was is one of the most politicized land claims in Canada, in parts because of its significance during the Oka Crisis. The claim originates from the original establishment of the Sulpician mission on the shore of Lac des Deux-Montagnes, where land was set aside for the Mohawks to settle in 1717. However, in 1721, King Louis XV of France granted the Seigneurie des Deux-Montagnes exclusively to the Sulpicians, giving them the legal title to the land. In the 19th century, the Mohawks of Kanesatake started protesting that the Sulpicians were mistreating them to the British authorities. They then discovered that the land they had lived on for over 150 years and they thought they owned was, in fact, not theirs, and started pressing their claim with the federal government. The case went to Supreme Court of Canada in 1910, which ruled that the Sulpicians held the titles to the land. In 1956, the Government of Canada purchased 6 km2 of the land previously owned by the Sulpicians for the Mohawks to live on, but did not grant this land reserve status. In 1975, the Mohawk Council submitted a comprehensive land claims asserting Aboriginal title to lands along the St. Lawrence River, the Ottawa River and Lac des Deux- Montagnes, a claim which was rejected by the federal government. In 1977, the Mohawk council of Kanesatake filed a specific claim regarding the former seigneurie. The claim was rejected the nine years later because it failed to meet key legal criteria. In 2002, the government passed Bill S-24, which established that the relation the government of Canada had with Kanesatake was akin to relations it has with bands with a reserve. In 2008, the government of Canada accepted to negotiate the claim of the Mohawks of Kanesatake under the specific claims policy for a second time. Former Assistant Deputy Minister Fred Caron was nominated as Chief Federal Negotiator for the file.  Criticism  The Specific Claims process has long been criticized by First Nations for multiple reasons, including the conflict of interest inherent in the government both assessing the claim and negotiating them, the slowness of the assessment process and the specific claims process in general, the impossibility of receiving land as compensation, the lack of transparency in Specific Claims funds allocations and the requirement to cede and surrender the land in order to get a compensation for it. The Assembly of First Nations (AFN) praised the creation of the Specific Claims Tribunal in 2008, that addressed some of these problems, but that many of the problems of the Specific Claims Policy were still left unsolved, especially regarding the extinguishment of indigenous rights. In 2018, the Fraser Institute published a report by conservative political scientist Tom Flanagan which concluded that first nation communities that received a compensation following the settlement of a specific claim did not score better on the Well-Being Index of First Nations than those who didn't. He argues that specific claims were essentially a multi-billion dollar liability for the government, while statistical evidence showed no positive impact to settling these claims. Flanagan also criticized changes made over the years to the specific claims policy to make it more accommodating to the First Nations, which he blames for creating ever- growing backlog of claims being filed every year. In order to settle all of the specific claims one and for all, Flanagan suggests the implementation of a deadline after which First Nations will no longer be able to file new specific claims. This would be akin to the United States' Indian Claims Commission's 10-year period to file claims, which allowed it to settle all of their indigenous land claims in under 40 years. In response to Flanagan's report, lawyers Alisa Lombard and Aubrey Charette of Maurice Law (Canada's only indigenous-owned law firm) published an opinion piece in which they said that the purpose of Specific claims is to bring justice to defrauded First nation communities, and is not a welfare program. Therefore, comparing the First Nation communities who settled a specific claim with those who didn't using the Well-Being Index is irrelevant to what the Specific Claims Process is trying to accomplish. A 2018 report by the British Columbia Specific Claims Working Group came to the conclusion that the federal government failed to comply by their legal obligation to assess claims in a 3 years period over 65% of the time. On average, the government finishes assessing the claims 5 months after the legislated deadline. In an open letter to Crown-Indigenous Relations minister Carolyn Bennett, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs stated that this \\"Non-compliance with legislation enacted to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples ... contradicts every public commitment your government has made regarding reconciliation\\". Stephan Matiation, director of the Specific Claims Branch at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, responded that his team is understaffed, which causes delays in the assessment of claims.

It stars the voices of Prunelle Charles-Ambron, Enzo Ratsito, and Natalie Dessay as Emma Calv√© in the original, French-language version. The film had an invitation-only world premiere on 11 June 2018 as the opening ceremony feature, and its public premiere on June 12, at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival before being released in cinemas on October 10 in France, on October 24 in Belgium and in 2019 in Germany. It won the C√©sar Award for Best Animated Feature at the 44th C√©sar Awards. It has been licensed for distribution in the United States and English-speaking Canada by Samuel Goldwyn Films (having already been released in Quebec by Axia Films), who released it in cinemas in 2019.  Production   Development  Director, writer, and designer Michel Ocelot has said that two starting points for the production were his desire to create a work set in Paris, and an originally separate desire to create one on the topic of male suppression and abuse of women and girls. He chose to combine these in a narrative which takes place in the Belle √âpoque, roughly in the 1900s, a decade in which several historical firsts for women in France were made. The film depicts some of the many notable historical figures who were often present in the city at the time, and features a fictionalized version of the opera singer Emma Calv√© as a supporting character. However, it simultaneously intentionally diverges from real history (and, as the director readily admits, laws of science) in its metaphorical main plot and inclusion of retrofuturist technology influenced by various works of Jules Verne and The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux.  Animation production  The 3D rendering style continues in that used in Azur & Asmar, in that the fabric, hair, and so on of the three-dimensional models is rendered as solid colours with no shading, though it differs in that the characters' bodies (which in Azur & Asmar were shaded from a fixed angle, in a style inspired by late medieval art) are defined with a tracing effect developed from that used in Kirikou and the Men and Women. The scenery incorporates photographs, taken by Ocelot over four years, of structures which survive from the depicted era or earlier, including the Palais Garnier, Bouillon Racine, Maxim's and the Paris sewers and objects from the collections of the Mus√©e d'Orsay, Mus√©e de l'√âcole de Nancy, Mus√©e Carnavalet, Mus√©e Rodin, Mus√©e du quai Branly ‚Äì Jacques Chirac, and Mus√©e Marmottan Monet, which are used directly as two-dimensional elements or for texture mapping rather than as reference material. Others were recreated in three dimensions, including the Eiffel Tower, which was based directly on architectural drawings from Gustave Eiffel's company. The digital library of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Gallica, was used for research and for two-dimensional empherea that were incorporated directly. Unlike Ocelot's two previous feature films, Tales of the Night and Kirikou and the Men and Women, Dilili has not been released in stereoscopic 3D.  Release  In North America, the film was released in cinemas in Quebec on 21 December 2018 by Axia Films and on video on demand throughout Canada by them on 7 March 2019, in both instances in French with no English options. It was released in cinemas in the United States and English-speaking Canada on 4 October 2019 by Samuel Goldwyn Films, with an English-language dub.http://www.samuelgoldwynfilms.com/dilili-in- parishttps://www.animationmagazine.net/features/dilili-in-paris-official- english-trailer-bows-in-theaters-oct-4/ In Australia, the film was played in cinemas as part of the 30th Alliance Fran√ßaise French Film Festival, which ran from 5 March to 18 April 2019 in 9 cities across the country, and it was released on DVD and video on demand in Australia and New Zealand on 10 July 2019 by Madman Entertainment, in both instances in French with English subtitles only.

Three kings of the Achaemenid Empire were known to have the same name.  Reign  Since the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 2nd century BCE, Persis had been ruled by local dynasts subject to the Seleucid Empire. They held the ancient Persian title of frataraka (\\"leader, governor, forerunner\\"), which is also attested in the Achaemenid-era. The Achaemenid Empire, which had a century earlier ruled most of the Near East, originated from the region. The frataraka themselves emphasized their close affiliation with the prominent Achaemenid king of kings, and their court was probably at the former Achaemenid capital of Persepolis, where they financed construction projects on and near the Achaemenid plateau. The frataraka had traditionally been regarded as priestly dynasts or advocates of religious (and political) opposition to Hellenism, however, this is no longer considered the case. The chronology of the early Persid rulers is disputed. The traditional view was that the chronology of the early rulers were; Baydad, Ardakhshir I, Wahbarz, Wadfradad I and Wadfradad II. However, recent findings of Persis coins have led to more a likely chronology; Ardakhshir I, Wahbarz, Wadfradad I, Baydad and Wadfradad II.

As per the 2011 Nepal census, the population of Rajputs is reported at 41,972. There were various historical groups of Rajputs from ancient and medieval India that have immigrated to Kathmandu valley, Khas Malla Kingdom, Western hill regions and other Terai territories. The Nepalese dynasty of Indian plain origin were Lichhavis who were Rajputs and entitled themselves with the archaic title Rajputra. The heavy Rajput immigration into Nepal began on the rise of Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent after the 12th century CE. These Rajputs particularly settled in Kathmandu valley, as well as in the various hills of the Himalayan ranges specially the Western-Central Nepal. Those Rajput groups in the Western Nepal led into disintegration of Khas Malla Kingdom and formation of large number of confederated states called Baise Rajya and Chaubisi Rajya. The Rajputs of the Kathmandu Valley established marital relations with the Newar Malla rulers of the Kathmandu valley, who were of Rajput origin themselves. Notable of these Malla Rajputs was the famed ruler Jayasthiti Malla who established Hindu reforms and social regulations among the Newar people of Kathmandu Valley. Rajput families from Indo-Gangetic plain were routinely invited by the Mallas of the Kathmandu valley and a new noble class of courtiers, presently called \\"Thakoo/Thakur\\" and part of the Chatharƒ´ya Srƒìstha caste, were developed from the descendants of the plain Rajputs in the Malla court. The Shah court also heavily favored Rajputs as legal regulations in the Kingdom of Nepal were inclined to them making them one of the Hindu high caste in the Tagadhari group and a faction not permitted to be enslaved in Nepal. Some writers are of the opinion that the Rajputs of Nepal, are of spurious descent and many families claimed Rajput descent for political purposes. Legends and Chronicles According to some legendary accounts in the chronicles such as the Gopal Genealogy and Wright Genealogy, the GopƒÅlava·πÉ≈õi/Gopal Bansa or \\"Cowherd Family\\" are said to have ruled Nepal especially the Kathmandu valley for some 491 years. They are said to have been followed by the Mahi·π£apƒÅlava·πÉ≈õa or \\"Buffalo-Herder Dynasty\\", established by a Rajput from Indo-Gangetic plain named Bhul Singh.Shaha, Rishikesh. Ancient and Medieval Nepal (1992), p. 7. Manohar Publications, New Delhi. . History Lichchavi Rajputras Kathmandu, Amshuverma (604-621 CE) Lichhavis were the first Nepalese dynasty of Indian plain origin who began their rule in the 4th or 5th century. Historian Baburam Acharya in an interview asserts that Amshuverma and the Lichhavi rulers were all Rajputs and Kshatriyas. Lichchavi inscription self describes them as Rajputras (princes). Rajputras who were ranked Kshatriyas, had special role in politics during the Lichchavi period. The Lichchavi inscription of Sikubahi (Shankhamul) mentions about Rajputra Vajraratha, Rajputra Babharuvarma, and Rajputra Deshavarma. Rajputra Babharuvarma and Rajputra Deshavarma were Dutakas (diplomats) in the reign of King Gangadeva and Amshuvarma respectively. Similarly, the Lichchavi inscription of Sanga mentions the name of Rajputra Vikramasena who was a Dandanayaka (judge). The Lichchavi inscription of Deopatan mentions Rajputra Shurasena as well as the inscriptions of Adeshwar mention the names of Rajputra Nandavarma, Rajputra Jishnuvarma and Rajputra Bhimavarma. Thus, historian Dhanavajra Vajracharya concludes that Rajputra of Kshatriya ranks were found abundantly in the topmost position in the Lichchavi court. Khas Rajputs  The Baleshwar Inscription of King Krachalla (or Krachalla Deva) of Khas Malla Kingdom at capital Dullu self proclaimed that he belonged to a Buddhist Jina family of hill Rajput background. The inscription mentions his two regional chiefs (Mandalikas) as Rawat Rajas. Baise (22) King of Doti, Raika Mandhata Shahi on Saka Era 1612 Few groups of Hindus including Rajputs were entering Nepal before the fall of Chittor due to regular invasions of Muslims in India. After the Fall of Chittorgarh in 1303 by the Alauddin Khilji of the Khalji dynasty, Rajputs from the region immigrated in large groups into Nepal due to heavy religious persecution. The incident is supported by both the Rajasthani and Nepalese traditions. Indian scholar Rahul Ram asserts that the Rajput immigration into Nepal is an undoubted fact but there can be questions in purity of blood of some leading families. Historian James Todd mentions that there was a one Rajasthani tradition that mentions the immigration of Rajputs from Mewar to Himalayas in the late 12th century after the battle between Chittor and Muhammad Ghori. Historian John T Hitchcock and John Whelpton contends that the regular invasions by Muslims led to heavy influx of Rajputs with Brahmins from the 12th century. The Hindu immigrants including Rajputs were mixed into the Khas society quickly as a result of much resemblance. The entry of Rajputs in the central Nepal were easily assisted by Khas Malla rulers who had developed a large feudatory state covering more than half of the greater Nepal. Also, the Magar tribesmen of Western Nepal welcomed the immigrant Rajput chiefs with much cordiality. After the late 13th century, the Khas Empire collapsed and was divided into Baise Rajya (22 principalities) in Karnali-Bheri region and Chaubise rajya (24 principalities) in Gandaki region. These Baise and Chaubise kingdoms were ruled by Rajputs and several decentralized tribal polities. Historian and Jesuit Ludwig Stiller contends that the Rajput intervention to the political affairs of Khas Malla Kingdom was significant reason behind the disintegration of the kingdom and he further conjectures: Newar Rajputs / Newar Mallas, Thakurs and Chathariyas Portrait of Rajput King Jayasthiti Malla (reign 1382-1395 CE) In 1380 A.D., the last Baish Thakuri King, Arjun Dev or Arjun Malla, was ousted by his ministers and was displaced by a Rajput King Sthiti Malla. Sthiti Malla self proclaimed as a Kshatriya of Sun-god descent. Sthiti Malla's successor, King Jyotir Malla and his successors invited Rajput families from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and began marital relations with them. The sons of Jyotirmalla were given the Rajput surname Singh while other sons were given the surname Malla. Rajput bridegrooms were procured from Bihar regions and were married to their daughters of the Malla rulers. These Rajput son-in-laws were included in the gotra of the Malla rulers and the son-in-law who lived with their Malla father-in-laws were given the surname Singh. Thus, the Rajput families became courtiers at Nepal and created a new endogamous courtier (Bharadari=Bharo) class. Rajput influx also occurred in the 14th century with the arrival of Karnat king Hari Simha Dev (14th century CE) and the entourage that came along with him to Kathmandu Valley with the attack of the Tirhut kingdom by Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq of Tughluq dynasty in 1324 CE. These Rajputs similarly established marriage alliances with the existing Malla kings. These Mallas and its courtier clans have now coalesced into a single caste group of Newar Kshatriya caste, locally called Chatharƒ´ya, which is believed to be the derivative of the word ‚ÄòKshatriya‚Äô, the second varna of the traditional Hindu varnashrama comprising kings, warriors and administrators. The Chatharƒ´yas consider themselves as the Raghuvamshi K·π£atriya descendants of the Karnat king Hari Simha Dev (14th century CE) and the Rajput entourage that came along with him. The Rajput clans that arrived at this time, and that have been transformed as present surnames among the Chatharƒ´yas, include Raghuvanshi, Rawal, Raithor, Chauhan, Chandel, and Hada. The presence of these notable present Chatharƒ´ya clan titles clearly non-indigenous to the Newars that are still prevalent among the present-day Rajputs of India has been suggested as evidence of the Chatharƒ´ya's claim to their ancestry. Additionally, these Rajput descendants who are seen as the highest segments of the present-day Chatharƒ´ya caste; clans like Malla, Pradhan, Pradhananga, Patrabansh, Bharo, Raghubanshi, Rajbansh, Rajbhandari, Onta, Amatya, Chauhan, Raithor, etc. are given the highest \\"Thakur/Thakoo\\" status, while other Chatharƒ´yas are lesser elevated, albeit still retaining their Chatharƒ´/K»ôatriya status. These Thakurs and Chatharƒ´yas, are nonetheless, accorded the second highest caste-status among Newars after the Rajopadhyaya Brahmins. In Jang Bahadur Rana's caste ordering in the Muluki Ain, Chatharƒ´yas were placed among the Tagadhari dwij- jati status of upper twice-born castes. The Muluki Ain refers them as tharghar ra asal sresth pointing out to the clans/houses as being of noble descent and being a real Shrestha, the archaic honorific term.https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/OPSA/article/download/1133/1558 Harka Gurung; The Dalit context Gorkhali Rajputs After the Rajput immigration in Western Nepal, Shah dynasty and their Thakuri clans began claiming descent from Rajput refugees of Chittor whose fort was sieged twice by the Muslim invaders in 1303 and 1568. The Raja Vamshavali (royal genealogy) written by Chitravilasa on the instigation of King Rama Shah of Gorkha Kingdom as well as the Goraksha Vamshavali (Goraksha genealogy) links the royal dynasty of Gorkha to the ruling Rawal Rajput family of Chittor. Richard Temple asserts that the some of the ruling dynasties of Nepal valley were of patrilineal \\"Aryan Rajput\\" descent and matrilineal aboriginal descent. He further contends that the royal house of Gorkha were such half-caste Rajputs. File:Prithvi Narayan Shah.jpg|King Prithvi Narayan of Gorkha claimed descent from Rawal Rajput family of Mewar File:Ram Krishna Kunwar.jpg|Ramakrishna Kunwar, a Gorkhali Kunwar noble claimed descent from Rana Rajput family of Mewar File:Nepali Cannon.JPG|Nepalese cannon at Gorkha Darbar covered up in red coloured Abir Kanwar, a historical Chhetri clan, self pro-claimed descent from Rana Rajputs of Chittor and received the title of Rana. The older version of their genealogy states that Kunwars were descended from a Rajput prince, Ram Singh Rana, a grand-nephew of the ruler of Mewar. The newer version of their origin published by Prabhakar, Gautam and Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana states that they were descended from Kunwar Kumbhakaran Singh, younger brother of Guhila King of Mewar, Rawal Ratnasimha. During the first siege of Chittorgarh in 1303 A.D., Kumbhakaran Singh's descendants left Mewar to north towards Himalayan foothills. Rajput, Chhetri and Thakuri Historian Baburam Acharya referred Chhetri as Rajputs in the Pyuthan state of Chaubise rajya where the group was placed opposed to Khawas (slave) or Matwali (liquor drinkers). These Rajputs spoke the Nepali language of the Aryan language family. During the reign of Mukunda Sen, Rajput Chhetris particularly Thapa, Rawal, Kunwar, Khatri and Khadka came from western regions and settled in his kingdom. Similarly, the Muluki Ain entitled \\"On Adultery and Slavery Among the Madhesiyas of the Tarai\\" mentions the Rajput Chhetri caste. Historian John T Hitchcock mentions that in Western Nepal and Kumaon, the Rajputs were either plain origin or Khas origin. He further referred Chhetris as \\"Khas Rajputs\\". Thakuris who are regarded as ruling clans of Nepal are also referred to as Rajputs. Prayag Raj Sharma mentions that the Rajputs referred in the Muluki Ain (Legal Code) were Thakuris. Rajput architecture During the period of Malla Kings, the architecture was of Mughal style. However, the architecture during the period of King Prithvi Narayan Shah was a Rajput style of architecture. King Prithvi Narayan Shah built the 115 feet high palace named Kailash to the south of Kathmandu palace in the Rajput style of architecture. He kept his eldest son and Crown Prince Pratap Singh Shah in the palace. During the rule of King Rana Bahadur Shah, a large house was built in Deopatan based on the Rajput style. A sanatorium was built for the treatment of Queen Kantiwati based on the Rajput style. As Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa rose, the European architecture increased in popularity ending the period of Rajput architecture. Provisions relating to Rajputs King Surendra of Nepal (1847-1881), Muluki Ain was formulated in his reign on 1854 The royal order by King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah dated Kartik Badi 10, 1860 V.S. (November 1803) declares that neither Brahmin and Rajput could be enslaved throughout the Kingdom of Nepal. The royal order by King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah promises to remit homestead taxes and levies to all Rajputs residing in the Kingdom of Nepal and exempts compulsory labor obligations to the royal court with restoration of their confiscated properties except those confiscated in the conquest. King Rajendra of Nepal issued royal orders with effect of enforcement from Ashadh Sudi 7, 1893 (July 1836) prohibiting sexual relations with widowed sister-in-law (i.e. wife of elder brother) among all castes and such act was made punishable by provisions as per the caste of the perpetrator. The punishment for the non-royal Rajput male perpetrator on that offence was ‚Äò‚Äôcutting of genitals‚Äô‚Äô. The legal code enacted on the reign of King Surendra of Nepal shows that the Brahmins of Jaisi caste were punishable by five of NRs. 40 if the male Jaisi Brahmin committed sexual offence to a Rajput girl without establishing commensal relationship with the girl and were punishable by NRs. 60 on the same assault with establishing commensal relationship with the girl. The royal order dated Kartik Badi 6, 1920 V.S. (November 1863) by King of Nepal Surendra Bikram Shah allows Thakuris and Rajputs of Kingdom of Nepal with fiscal privileges of exemption on payment of Serma 1 levies in lieu of compulsory labor (Jhara, Khara, Beth, Begari, Hulak), Walak until 1919 V.S. as well as exemption on levies payable to Zamindars and local administrators (Amali) from the year 1920 V.S. The additions made in Muluki Ain (Legal Code) until 1922-23 Vikram Samvat (1865-66) consists two titles of provisions specially on Rajputs: 114\\\\. Rajput ko Hadnata (Incest among Rajputs). 147\\\\. Ghati badi jat ma karani garnya Rajputko (Law relating to Rajputs who commit illicit sexual intercourse with women of higher or lower caste). As per the Muluki Ain titled ‚Äò‚ÄôOn Adultery and Slavery Among the Madhesiyas of the Tarai‚Äô‚Äô, the a man of the Matwali caste of Terai is punishable with imprisonment up to 3 years if he commits adultery with the female of Rajput Chhetri without commensality. If he was proven with commensality, the punishment increases to 6 years on the case. Modern (21st century) The caste with the largest ratio of representation in the civil service in Nepal is, the Rajput, who have a presence in the civil service that is 5.6 times that of their presence in the population.

Lieutenant Commander Frank Sprig Gardner, U.S. Navy  Early life and education  Gardner grew up in southern Pennsylvania and attended Franklin and Marshall College, graduating in 1930. He did not wrestle in college; his knowledge of the sport came from an F&M; roommate who wrestled.  Career  His first job out of college was as a football coach in 1930 at East Hampton High School, East Hampton, Long Island. His short tenure there was successful, turning a losing program around. He briefly coached wrestling; under his leadership Long Island wrestling began at East Hampton in 1933. In 1936 Gardner accepted the position of Director of Athletics and head wrestling coach at the Mepham School District in the second year of its existence.Father of New York State wrestling His first team at Mepham was a junior varsity team of 9th and 10th graders in 1936‚Äì37. Mepham High School, Bellmore, Long Island, opened in 1937; and, in 1937‚Äì38 the wrestling team entered varsity rank. Mepham would not know defeat in a meet or tournament until January 31, 1946 when Baldwin High School defeated Mepham 21-15 after an undefeated string of 100 meets and tournaments. After that defeat, Mepham would not lose again until January 14, 1955 when Amityville ended the undefeated streak of 130 by one point. During this unprecedented span Mepham won 18 consecutive South Shore titles and 17 Sectional Championships. In 1958, his last season as the wrestling coach, Coach Gardner's undefeated team (20-0) won 9 of 12 individual sectional titles, scoring 186 points, which totaled more than the combined score of the next ten schools. Gardner and his Mepham wrestlers were featured in a five- page article in Life Magazine during the early 1950s. His success was felt to be due to his personal philosophy, coaching acumen and innovation. Gardner created the concept of chain moves and drilling in practice sessions; this drill system revolutionized the sport, and he shared his concepts with books and articles. When he started coaching wrestling in New York there were crudely run programs at just a few schools. He was a major factor in the expansion of high school wrestling in New York, particularly Long Island, booming with growth and new high schools after World War ll. Gardner would visit every new school, bringing his team to an assembly and going through the values of wrestling. As of 2010, there were 110 high schools on Long Island, and 105 having wrestling teams. He has been called the \\"Father of New York State Wrestling.\\" Gardner was involved in devising regulations concerning weight classifications, match scoring procedures, and tournament procedures at local, state, and national levels. His 21 year coaching career was interrupted for three years by World War ll; within six months of Pearl Harbor he signed up for a naval commission. He served as a lieutenant commander in the Pacific aboard an aircraft carrier. After leaving Mepham in 1958, he spent two years restoring the wrestling program at Gettysburg College in the early 1960s. In 1963 he authored The Young Sportsman's Guide to Wrestling (Thomas Nelson).  Coaching philosophy  When he started the Mepham wrestling program in 1936, he simply wanted to teach skills and sportsmanship to young athletes. Gardner felt he coached not wrestling but life, and imparted a concern for academic, athletic, and civic pride and responsibility. He stressed humility in victory and quiet acceptance of defeat.  Honors  The longstanding annual Long Island invitational Sprig Gardner Wrestling Tournament is named for him. He is a member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame; other Halls of Fame (HOF) include the New York State Wrestling HOF, the Franklin and Marshall Athletic HOF, the Nasssau High School Athletics HOF, and the Long Island Sports HOF. On the granite stone commemorating him for the National HOF is imprinted the following: > In recognition of his fabulous coaching career, and a lifetime of leadership > in the development of wrestling, Frank ‚ÄúSprig‚Äù Gardner is honored as a > Distinguished Member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame.

Synopsis  Fisher argues that a largely-online style of identity-based leftist discourse grounded in \\"witch-hunting moralism\\" halts productive leftist discourse and undermines class politics. In particular, the combination of a primary focus on identity and the policing of others' speech is deleterious. Fisher saw the turn from class and materialism towards identity as a move from objective outward-facing goals to subjective inward goals that result in fragmentation of the left's efforts and community.  Reception  Jacobin magazine described \\"Exiting the Vampire Castle\\" as Fisher's \\"most loved and hated essay\\".  Influence  Angela Nagle grounds her critique of the left in her book Kill All Normies on Fisher's essay. She uses the essay to diagnose the political situation of the 2016 United States presidential election in particular and leftist use of social media platforms in general. Michael Brooks' book Against the Web pulls heavily on concepts from \\"Exiting the Vampire Castle\\" to highlight the limits he observes in the tactics of the left. As an alternative to the condemnation and alienation common among leftists of the Castle, Brooks proposes a \\"cosmopolitan socialism\\" building on the works of Cornel West, Amartya Sen, and C. L. R. James.

It serve the nearby area of Begunkodor and Jhalda town in the Purulia district in the Indian state of West Bengal. Passengers deserted the station and it had come to be known as haunted in Railway records. The station was listed by Railways as one of its 10 haunted stations in India. History Begunkodor station was set up by the joint efforts of the queen of Santals, Smt. Lachan Kumari and Indian Railways in the year 1960. Controversy According to the villagers of Begunkodor, in 1967, a railway employee reported the sighting of a woman's ghost, and it was rumored that she had died in a railway accident. The next day he told people about it but they ignored him. The real trouble started when the dead bodies of the station master and his family were found in their quarters. The station was subsequently closed as trains stopped making halts here due to paranormal myth. In the late 1990s the villagers formed a committee and asked the officials to reopen the station. In 2007, local villagers wrote to then Railway minister Smt Mamata Banerjee and CPIM leader Basudeb Acharia, who belongs to Purulia and was member of the parliamentary standing committee on Railways at the time. But the haunted tag remains. Acharia said that railway employees had made up the story to avoid being posted there. After 42 years, in August 2009, the railway station was finally reopened as a passenger train halt, by former Railway minister Mamata Banerjee. However, regularly 10 trains halt here, but passengers still avoid using the station after sunset. Many ghost hunters have visited the station repeatedly confirming that there is no presence of ghosts. Presently Begunkodor railway station was being touted by certain people for some time as a ghost tourist spot to attract visitors.

The park can be called either \\"Mezyad Desert Park\\" or \\"Jebel Hafeet Desert Park\\".  History  As a region, Al-Ain has been inhabited for over 7 millennia, as demonstrated by archeological finds. In particular, there are tombs shaped as beehives in the area of Mezyad, at the base of Jebel Hafeet, which date back to the Hafit period of the Early Bronze Age, besides In the 1950s, Sheikh Zayed, who would become the founding President of the United Arab Emirates, discovered the tombs, and brought this to the attention of a Danish team, leading to an excavation at the tombs in 1959. In 1971, Al Ain Museum was built to house items from this area. In the 2000s, the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture & Heritage lobbied for its recognition as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and in 2011, Al-Ain became the first World Heritage Site in the UAE to be recognized by UNESCO.

Background A UFC Light Heavyweight Championship bout between current two-time champion Jon Jones and Thiago Santos served as the event headliner. A UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between the current champion Amanda Nunes (also current UFC Women's Featherweight Champion) and former champion Holly Holm served as the event co-headliner. A bout between former UFC Heavyweight title challenger Francis Ngannou and former UFC Heavyweight Champion Junior dos Santos was scheduled to take place at this event. The matchup was originally scheduled to take place in September 2017 at UFC 215, but dos Santos pulled out of that event, citing a failed drug test. However, it was reported on May 21, that the bout was being moved to headline UFC on ESPN 3 after former UFC Welterweight Champion Tyron Woodley was forced to pull out of his rematch against also former champion Robbie Lawler due to a hand injury. A featherweight bout between former Strikeforce and WEC Lightweight Champion (as well as former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger) Gilbert Melendez and Arnold Allen headlined the prelims of the event. The matchup was originally scheduled to take place in November 2018 at The Ultimate Fighter: Heavy Hitters Finale, however Melendez pulled out of the fight citing an injury. A bantamweight bout between The Ultimate Fighter: Latin America bantamweight winner Alejandro P√©rez and Yadong Song took place at this event. The matchup was originally scheduled to take place in March 2019 at UFC 235, but Song pulled out of the fight for undisclosed reasons. Sean O'Malley was expected to face Marlon Vera at the event. However, O'Malley announced his withdrawal from the bout on June 21 due a failed test for ostarine. The Nevada State Athletic Commission decided to suspend him due to the failed test, however the United States Anti Doping Association USADA will not impose any further sanctions. The ostarine in his system was likely residual from his previously failed test prior to UFC 229. Drako Rodriguez from King of the Cage was offered to replaced O'Malley initially; however the president of the promotion, Terry Trebilcock, refused to release him. Nohelin Hernandez served as the replacement. Melissa Gatto was scheduled to face Julia Avila at the event.

It stars professional basketball small forward LeBron James and businessman Maverick Carter, who alongside guests have conversations and debates in a barbershop. The series premiered on HBO in the United States on August 28, 2018. Production Conception and development for Uninterrupted LeBron James in 2018 In December 2014, James' longtime friend and business partner Maverick Carter launched Uninterrupted (stylized in all caps), a platform designed for athletes to give testimonials about their experiences. Uninterrupted was created and produced by James' SpringHill Entertainment production company, run by Carter, and hosted on Turner Sports' Bleacher Report website. Athletes that made early contributions to Uninterrupted included Rob Gronkowski, Draymond Green, and Ronda Rousey. In December 2015, Warner Bros. and Turner Sports invested $15.8 million in the platform. By March 2017, Uninterrupted was described by Forbes as a digital media company. James spoke on how The Shop became an idea saying, \\"when I was a kid, being in barbershops meant listening to adults talk about sports, clothing, politics, music, everything happened in the shop. It was so real and so candid ‚Äî no one had a sense of, well I can't be myself here.\\" Randy Mims and Paul Rivera, both business partners of James' and Carter's, first proposed The Shop. In February 2016, during the NBA's All-Star Weekend, the first iteration of The Shop was filmed in a Toronto-based barbershop for the Uninterrupted website. The following year, another episode of The Shop was filmed in a New Orleans-based barbershop. James and Carter were joined by Golden State Warriors power forward Draymond Green, Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz, Grey's Anatomy star Jesse Williams, former New York Knicks All-Star Charles Oakley, and businessman Steve Stoute. Stoute moderated the group's discussion, which notably generated James detailing how his mother did not want him to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014. The filming premiered on the Uninterrupted platform on June 9, 2017, coinciding with Game 4 of the NBA Finals between James' Cavaliers and Green's Warriors. The New Orleans episode was optioned by ESPN as a one-off. HBO iteration Following the New Orleans episode, talks with HBO began in earnest. HBO then ordered a handful of episodes of The Shop, with the episode order being left vague due to James' primary focus on his basketball career. The deal with HBO did not include airing the Toronto or New Orleans episodes; the first episode for HBO was filmed in West Hollywood's Barber Surgeons Guild, in July 2018. The episode guest starred New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., rapper Snoop Dogg, Los Angeles Sparks forward Candace Parker, comedian Jon Stewart, New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara, and Green, alongside James and Carter. The episode premiered on HBO on August 28. Further episodes aired later throughout the year. The second episode was filmed in a Washington, D.C. hair salon, which houses a separate cuttery. This episode is notable for the guest appearance from rapper Drake, who spoke on the personal troubles between him and fellow musician Kanye West. Drake was honest and offered insight to the fight that normally would not have been made known. The third and fourth episodes were also filmed in Los Angeles, with the latter notable for wide receiver Antonio Brown publicly musing on his dissatisfaction with his role on the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as with his heated relationship with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The second season of The Shop premiered on March 1, 2019, with the premiere episode being filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina, during the NBA's 2019 All-Star Weekend. Episodes Reception Following the series' HBO premiere, Haley O'Shaughnessy of The Ringer wrote: \\"The setting creates a very personal facade, an opportunity to speak on fame and kids and race openly. The viewer is in on the conversation, but isn't in the conversation. Opinions on hot- topic issues that LeBron's addressed before aren‚Äôt delivered like a sermon, which are more likely to fall flat. He‚Äôs chatting with people he respects. And you feel like part of that group.\\" O'Shaughnessy added that, \\"The Shop is another platform, but it isn't a pedestal. It's not a postgame press conference, where power dynamics are heavily skewed. It's an HBO show that attempts to keep a level playing field for everyone involved.\\" Following the second episode, The Ringers Micah Peters opined, \\"[The Shop is] really good TV‚Äì‚Äìthey sip wine, they offer a side of themselves rarely seen in public, and LeBron James says swear words. Even the color palette is spare and direct. This, like most barbershops, is a space reserved strictly for real talk.\\" Rashad Grove of The Source wrote on the series' authenticity of the Black barbershop experience, \\"LeBron on The Shop is showing the world what really goes down at the Black barbershop. The conversations are raw and authentic over many glasses of wine.\\" Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times published a lukewarm review of the first episode, writing, \\"Though the effort to capture the vibrance and tell-it-like-it-is spirit of the African American barbershop met with slightly mixed results in the first episode, The Shop is more than worth a return visit,\\" and adding \\"stylish black-and-white photographs of guests arriving at the shop serve as act breaks and enhance the show‚Äôs documentary feel. But the choppy editing sometimes removes context from the conversation, offering little sense of how one subject flows to the next.\\" Billy Haisley of Deadspin wrote a more critical review of The Shops first episode, questioning its candidness. Haisley referred to other outlets' comments on the episode, writing,\\" Amazing: Slate, the Washington Post, and HBO all agree that an edited, literally filtered TV program created, produced, and starring a world-famous athlete with a notoriously and meticulously maintained image is best described as 'unfiltered.' The Ringer and the Sporting News at least consulted a thesaurus before copying The Shops press release language, writing, respectfully, that the episode was 'honest' and 'candid.'\\" Haisley added, \\"The point here isn't that the things LeBron and Co. say in The Shop are insincere or fake or anything of the sort [...] Rather, the point is that the things said in The Shop are calculated, risk-free, decidedly filtered, stated for the predominate purpose of bolstering LeBron's brand. It's to position LeBron as a bold truth-teller without him having to actually tell any bold truths. And it should be treated as such.\\" Carrie Battan of The New Yorker wrote positively of the show's candidness, however, commenting: \\"Theoretically, The Shop should have been yet another affirmation of our worst suspicions‚Äîthat we would only ever get to see our superheroes in sanitized, strictly controlled ways. But James has offered a potent rebuttal to the argument that celebrities can't make interesting, revelatory content about themselves and their colleagues.\\" Battan wrote a positive review of The Shop, following its first season, as she opined positively on the series' setting \\"designed to generate the sense of candor, camaraderie, and intimacy that happens inside African-American barbershops.\\" Battan conceded \\"[she does] not operate under the delusion that this show is a purely unfiltered, candid, and unprecedentedly revealing look at the assembled stars. There are plenty of platitudes and generalities being proffered here,\\" but opined that The Shop \\"does exactly what the best celebrity profiles have always aspired to do: delight, surprise, inform.\\" Due to the series airing during James' basketball career, sports media outlets naturally covered The Shop, focusing on segments that dealt with James' presence in basketball. The ongoings of James' first season as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers lent themselves to discussion topics on the series, which led to further coverage by sports media. For example, Anthony Davis was the subject of rumors regarding an attempt to trade him to the Lakers at the time of his appearance on The Shop. The series also chronicled James' and fellow Lakers teammate Lonzo Ball's reactions to Magic Johnson stepping down from his Lakers front office role during the 2019 offseason; this was also noted by sports media outlets.

She is professor emerita of General History at the University of Tampere. Hietala introduced in Finland the study of innovations and international contacts. She has held a range of positions of trust both in Finland and internationally.  Education  Hietala read general history, Finnish and Scandinavian history, statistics, sociology and politics at the University of Helsinki, gaining her MA in 1968, Licentiate degree in 1970 and master's degree in Social Sciences in 1971. Her PhD (1975) analysed German right-wing and militaristic nationalism on the basis of the works by Ernst J√ºnger and his associates. Hietala's doctoral dissertation paved the way for using content analysis and statistical methods in Finnish historiography. Hietala's doctoral work brought her into close contact with the school of thought on the history of ideas headed by Professor Aira Kemil√§inen at the University of Jyv√§skyl√§. As a result, she co-worked with Kemil√§inen on the history of racial hygiene. This also informed her interest in intellectual and urban history, and the spread of innovations and international contacts.  Career  Hietala opened her research career in the Ministry of the Interior and the Prime Minister's Office. She then moved on to serve as an Assistant in the Department of History at the University of Helsinki and as a Senior Researcher of the Academy of Finland. In 1994‚Äì1996, she was only the third woman to hold a Chair of General History in a Finnish university (at the University of Joensuu). Her two female predecessors were Professors Alma S√∂derhjelm (appointed in 1927) and Hietala's teacher and mentor Aira Kemil√§inen (appointed in 1971). Hietala became professor of General History at the University of Tampere in 1996, and occupied this post until 2011 apart from a five-year period as an Academy Professor with the Academy of Finland in 2002‚Äì2007. In Tampere, a group of researchers congregated around Marjatta Hietala, with a focus on the history of science and innovations, and intellectual and urban history. It was in this group that her successor in Tampere, Marjaana Niemi, completed her academic training.  Focus of teaching and research  In the study of history Marjatta Hietala has applied a range of methods typically used in the natural sciences, especially quantitative methods involving the analysis of long time series. She has also encouraged participation in international research groups, and has herself done comparative research in, for example, Germany and the United States. Her studies on urban history and the spread of innovations show that Finland was among the first nations to adopt technological advances (such as telephones and street lighting) at the end of the 19th century and in the opening decades of the 20th century. Hietala's comparative methods on the spread of innovations are widely used internationally.  Science administration  Hietala has served science administration as a member of the Research Council for Culture and Society of the Academy of Finland (1995‚Äì2000), as a member of the Matriculation Examination Board (1993‚Äì2003), and has sat in a range of committees and working groups. She introduced the technique of oral history based on interviews into Finland, promoting a project in the 1980s to interview veteran members of the Finnish parliament. A corpus of interviews with more than 400 former Members of Parliament is now available in the Library of Parliament, and the work continues. Another long-term commitment, in the 1980s, was the UNESCO-hosted project on how internationalisation was integrated in upper secondary school textbooks in Britain, Finland, the German Democratic Republic, Italy and Poland. Hietala has acted as an external reviewer of several universities and academic fields in Finland, Europe and the United States. Her international career culminated as the President of the International Committee of Historical Sciences in the Conference in Jinan, China, in 2015.

Piper (April 22, 1849 - May 26, 1876), also known as The Boston Belfry Murderer, was a Canadian-born American serial killer who murdered at least two underage girls between 1873 and 1875 in Massachusetts. He was subsequently hanged for his crimes. Biography Early life Originally from Nova Scotia, Piper was the second-born son of farmer T. C. Piper. Thomas worked as a carpenter on a farm his family owned, before moving with them to Boston in 1866, occasionally working for his father, but aspiring to do better things. Regarded as literate and clever, he had worked at several clerking jobs around the city and was an avid Baptist church-goer, which resulted in him being hired as a sexton for the Warren Avenue Baptist Church. Piper also had some sort of kidney disorder, which he \\"treated\\" with a secret addiction - using laudanum mixed with alcohol, which caused hallucinations. Unbeknownst to many, he started committing acts of arson before moving on to his first murder. Murder of Bridget Landregan On the night of December 5, 1873, while walking with two of his brothers to the church in Dorchester, Piper suddenly told them that he wasn't feeling well and wanted to go back home. He first went to a place which sold opium and mixed it with alcohol, drinking it all before returning to his house. He then took a saw and sawed off a piece of shaft, before exiting the house, walking around some and hiding under a fence. Soon after, a fire alarm was rung, and when the commotion quieted down, Piper was standing on the street with his brother when he noticed a young woman walking down the street - Bridget Landregan, a domestic servant of good repute returning to her mistress' home. The brothers went inside the house, with Thomas claiming he was going to go to bed, but instead went down to the kitchen, grabbed the shaft and began walking after Landregan. He stalked her for some time until they reached Columbia Street, at which point Bridget noticed him. At that moment, Piper struck her with the shaft, causing Landregan to fall down before hitting her again, breaking her skull. Before he could do anything with the body, he noticed that a man was coming down the street, so he got up and began running. He climbed over a fence going along the railroad, taking a round-about way to his home, disposing of a knife that he thought could be recognised as his along the way. Several arrests were made concerning the case, including Piper, but he was initially discharged due to lack of evidence. A former lover of Landregan, an Irishman named Thomas Cahill, was extradited from his home country after detectives wanted to question him. However, no evidence could link the murder to him, and Cahill soon returned to Ireland, where he himself was murdered. Assault on Mary Tyner In 1874, while visiting the downtown area of Boston, Piper met Tyner, a prostitute, on Lagrange Street. Both engaged in conversation, with Thomas inviting her to a saloon, to which Mary agreed. After they had some drinks together, Piper and Tyner went to her house, where they soon fell asleep. In the middle of the night, Thomas suddenly woke up and, noticing that his companion was asleep, he grabbed a hammer-like object and struck Tyner several times on the head with it. He then promptly left the house by exiting through a window, opting to sleep in the church for the rest of the night. Although Tyner survived the attack, she was unable to identify her attacker, and was sent to live out her days as an inmate of a lunatic asylum. A former lover of hers named Colby was arrested, but later released due to lack of evidence. Murder of Mabel H. Young On May 23, 1875, a 5-year-old girl named Mabel Hood Young was attending a service in the Warren Avenue Baptist church, where Piper worked as a sexton. Thomas had taken a bat from the lower room, with the intention to kill somebody with it, up to the belfry. After the service ended, he sent away the boys playing in the vestibule, and lured the young Mabel to the tower with the promise of showing her the pigeons. When they went in there, Piper struck the young girl on the head with the bat a few times, causing her to fall down. Thomas intended to rape her, thinking that Young was dead, but when he realised she wasn't, he moved the badly-injured girl to another place, where she was soon found. Piper was arrested, but Mabel died from her injuries the following day. Trial and execution Piper's first trial, prosecuted by Suffolk County District Attorney Oliver Stevens, ended in a hung jury, as he constantly protested his innocence, adding to the fact that there was no real reason or evidence to convict him in the case, resulting in nine voting for a conviction but three for an acquittal. In the second trial, headed by Attorney-General Charles R. Train, they managed to convict him with circumstantial evidence. Piper first appeared stoically indifferent in court, but began to look increasingly concerned on his way back to the cell. He hastily began writing a letter addressed to his mother in which he wrote that he hoped he would be acquitted, but knew it wouldn't happen. Although this attempt at earning sympathy from the public was unsuccessful, prior to his conviction, his invented story of how Mabel was murdered was considered credible before he admitted it was false: initially, Piper claimed that he had wanted to show Mabel the pigeons, but the air was stuffy, and he decided to open up the window to let some fresh air in. He held it down with the bat and left for a moment, but when he returned, he noticed that the trapdoor had fallen on Young's head. Afraid of being accused of assault, Piper fled downstairs to tell a few of the women about the accident, but remained silent out of fear. The motive for the crime was suggested as being pure lust for bloodshed and, under pressure from the whole ordeal, Piper confessed to Young's murder. To the shock of the Boston population, he confessed to other crimes as well, including the murder of Landregan, the arsons, the assault on Tyner and that he also murdered a girl named Minnie Sullivan. Although there wasn't enough evidence to convict him in the other cases, Piper was sentenced to death for the murder of Mabel Young. He tried to appeal his sentence unsuccessfully. Piper's execution was attended by at least 300 people and he was executed by hanging on May 26, 1876, along with the \\"Petersham Murderer\\", Samuel J. Frost. His body was then privately buried at the Mount Hope Cemetery. Following his execution, Piper's family asked that Thomas's written and detailed confession of the crimes, which was given to Sheriff John M. Clark, not be released to the public. Clark agreed with the plea, as the majority of Piper's crimes were already known to the public and nobody wanted to further horrors to the terrible deeds of the murderer.

Biography   Early life  Ron was born in 1968, in London. In the early 1980s, he began his career in music culture starting with his involvement in the body popping crew, Popping Wizards. As a second-generation Caribbean immigrant growing up in East London in the 1980s, both Ron's Guyanese heritage and his London surroundings influenced his musical taste. In his adolescent years, Ron practised DJing and scratching in his bedroom, with his friends Rodney P and MC Mell‚ÄôO‚Äô. His passion for scratching was influenced by both Master MC from Rapattack sound system and Malcolm McLaren's album Duck Rock.  Career   1982‚Äì1992: Early projects and success  After playing on his elder brother‚Äôs sound system Romancers Delight, Ron was spotted by the East London sound system, TNT Road-Show Sound System, which he played on between 1982 and 1986. With his time with TNT and additionally playing at two key events, one being a sound clash at Acton Town Hall, ‚ÄòSoul All Dayer of the Century‚Äô (1987) and the other being an event at Loyola Hall, Ron's public appearance grew. With that, Ron and Rebel MC met and began working together. First, playing together on the Beatfreak Sound System and in the studio to record tracks, including recording \\"Micron ‚Äì Eastenders Rap\\" (1988). The studio sessions then came to a halt, following with the two touring together. Ron's national recognition elevated when appearing twice on Top of the Pops when Rebel MC's first two singles reached number 3 and number 11 respectively in the national charts.  1993‚Äì1996: The Jungle Don  The rise of jungle music and Ron's developing DJ career went hand in hand. In 1992 Ron hosted a radio show on Kool FM as part of the A-Team Supreme Team with DJ SL, MC Moose and MC 5ive-0, and guests including DJ Brockie, Grooverider, Kenny Ken, Fabio and Ray Keith. He also hosted radio shows on Weekend Rush FM and Centreforce intermittently. Ron was at many notable jungle events which acted as a platform that boosted his DJing appearances. He then became a resident DJ at various rave organisations such as; Telepathy (1991‚Äì1995), Pirate Club (1992‚Äì1994), Desert Storm (1993‚Äì1995), Sunday Roast (1991‚Äì1996), VIP Champagne Bash (1994‚Äì1996), and Jungle Fever 1993‚Äì1996). Ron launched a record label, London Some 'Ting Records in 1994, which to date, combined with subsidiary labels formed under the 'LSR' banner, have released close to 100 tracks. In 1994, Ron became musical director for seminal documentary A London Some 'Ting Dis. The documentary explored the growing jungle scene, with interviews of jungle musicians and footage of music events, and was first shown on Channel 4. In 1994, Ron was selected amongst a group of five other DJs to perform on a tour around four North American states, starting with three shows at the Winter Music Conference in Miami. This was the first time UK DJs had travelled to the United States to share this new genre of music, an opportunity that would extend the audience of \\"junglists\\" or jungle music enthusiasts. The following year, DJ Ron was chosen to be the first DJ to play a jungle DJ set on BBC Radio 1. The mix was named \\"The Circumstances of Jungle Music\\" and was aired on Pete Tong‚Äôs Essential Mix show in 1995.  1996‚Äì2012: hiatus and creative return  In 1996, Ron was signed by a major record label, RCA Records. The signing to RCA would have involved producing a jungle album, however, owing to a life-threatening car accident which required an extended period of convalescence, coupled with starting a family, Ron withdrew from DJing, focussing his attention on recovery and family. For over a decade, Ron continued to release music under different pseudonyms and different musical genres. These releases included DJ Ron - Quintessence. Later, after a decade and a half of a hiatus in his musical career, in 2012 Ron studied and achieved a BA Honours in Practical Film Making at the Met Film School University in Ealing Film Studios. He was then employed by Rinse FM to design and birth their fledgling online TV division.  2013‚Äìpresent: musical return  In 2015, having been head of TV at Rinse FM for three years and having produced music videos for Rinse FM's musicians, Ron habitually focuses on his independent production company London Something. London Something is currently in collaboration with a number of acts, artists and organisations, working on film and music productions. Since 2015, Ron has also had a Rinse FM show, currently biweekly. In 2018, Ron appeared at Notting Hill Carnival as part of the announcement of the Chase & Status RTRN II Jungle album. Also in 2018 Mixmag featured Ron's as one of the best Jungle mixes you can hear online. DJ Ron also performed several times on the official Chase & Status RTRN II Jungle 2018 tour.

However, behind the scenes, the girl seems to hate her guts.  Reception  Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network gave the first volume an overall B+ grade. Silverman noted that the first volume was \\"much more interested in the parodic aspects of the story, though, so readers should be prepared for more humor than actual yearning glances, and a certain degree of familiarity with Class S yuri is probably going to make the book more enjoyable\\" Anime UK News gave the first volume 8/10, praising its strong setup and additional German translation notes.

It consists of heated chambers, adjustable to the width of the fabric being treated. Fabric is fed into the heated chamber supported at either selvedge by a series of stenter pins or clamps which support the fabric as it is moved through the drying chambers. (Note: Stenter pins are the modern equivalent of tenterhooks) The input and output speed of the fabric is closely controlled, as is the output width, determining the moisture content of the fabric after drying, and the dimensional stability.|}}  Etymology and History  Stenter is driven from Tenter, Tenter comes from the Latin tendere, to stretch, via a French intermediate. The main purpose of the machine is to stretch and dry. The frames were called tenters and the tentering hooks were the metal hooks used for holding the fabric to the frame. Tenters were used to process woolen fabric. , In the cleaning process after squeezing excess water the woolen cloth was crumpled and needed to be straightened and dried under tension, or it would shrink. The wet cloth was stretched on a large wooden frame, a \\"tenter\\", and left to dry. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the tenter using hooks (nails driven through the wood) all around the perimeter of the frame to which the cloth's edges were fixed. This ensured that as it dried the cloth would retain its shape and size. When Higher Mill was built the tentering was done in the open air, the tenter frames were erected on the hillside to the east of the mill. Towards the end of World War I, the process was brought inside and dried by steam heating. Slowly it turned into a modern- day stenter machine.  Holding hook types  # Pins # Clips  Uses Stenter is a very useful machine in a textile process house, The machine plays a vital role in finishing.The machine may be equipped with padding manlge which is useful in squeezing excessive moisture and applying various finishes such as wrinkle-free, water repellent, waterproof, anti- static , and flame retardant, etc. Coating and dyeing applications are also possible on a setnter machine with suitable paddersand coating attachments. There are various optional attachments such as tendamatic, weft straightener, bowing and skew cameras, over-feeding, edge gumming and trimming, residual moisture control, etc. which helps in increasing its functionality and usage. Stenter is primarily used for the following. *Drying and adjustment of the width. *Application of softeners and various chemical finishes. Most of the textile finishes are applied to stenter machine. Regular softening to specialize finishes are applied on wet to wet or Dry to wet finishing mode. Dry to wet finishing route is preferred where more amount of chemical is required. *GSM (Grams per square meter) by adjusting overfeed, and manipulating the courses and wales or Picks and ends in knitted and woven fabrics respectively. *Shrinkage control by overfeeding /increasing input and controlling output speeds. *Heatsetting both pre-heatset and post-heat-setting of the fabrics.

It is located by the Cibanten River about 10 km south of the port of Banten, on the southern outskirts of Serang town. In that place there is an archaeological site which estimated dated to the era of Sunda Kingdom between 932 and 1030 CE. The term Banten Girang, meaning \\"Banten-up-the-river\\" referring to its location. The Banten Girang archaeological site consists of several tombs, punden berundak stepped pyramid, and the caves of Banten Girang. The caves is man-made holes carved on stone cliff, and took form of small niches. According to the research conducted by a French archaeologist Claude Guillot in 1988-1992, the Banten Girang site is a residential or settlement site. He estimated that this site originated in the 10th century and reached its peak between the 13th-14th century CE. The settlement was the predecessor of the eponymous Banten Sultanate that located further downstream on the coastal area, that in the 16th century rose to become an important port in the region, especially vital for pepper trade of that era. History The vicinity of Banten Girang was settled since the 10th century or probably earlier. In the National Museum of Indonesia in Jakarta, there are a number of 10th century Hindu statues dubbed as the \\"Caringin statues\\", because they were once used as the garden decoration of Dutch assistant-resident in Caringin, a village by the Sunda Strait. The statue reportedly was found in Cipanas area, near the crater of Mount Pulosari, east of Caringin or further southwest from Banten Girang. The Hindu pantheon images consists of one pedestal and 5 statues of Shiva Mahadeva, Durga, Agastya, Ganesha and Brahma. The style of these statues is similar to those of Central Javanese Hindu statue dated from the beginning of the 10th century, linked with the religious symbolism and artistic style of the Medang Mataram Hindu kingdom in Central Java. Therefore, Mount Pulosari is associated with nearby Banten Girang, and is estimated to be one of the religious center of the Sundanese kingdom. The Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written circa 1200, Chou Ju-kua identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the Indonesian archipelago as Sriwijaya and Java (Kediri). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, Sriwijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and the port of Sin-t'o (Sunda) in western Java. The source identifies the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, pepper from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (rumah panggung). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country. It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua. The port is located near the Strait of Sunda, thus it probably referred to the port of Banten instead of Kalapa (present day Jakarta). In early 16th century, the ruler of Banten was Prabu Pucuk Umun with the seat of government located in Banten Girang. The Banten Ilir or Banten Lama at that time served as its port. The religion adopted by Prabu Pucuk Umun and his people at that time was Hinduism. On the banks of the Cibanten River, there is an artificial cave carved on a cliff edge. The cave has two entrances in which there are three rooms. According to Sajarah Banten, when arrived in Banten Girang, Sunan Gunungjati and his son, Hasanuddin, visited Mount Pulosari, which was the spiritual center for the kingdom. There, Gunungjati converted the local community to Islam and conquered the kingdom militarily. In 1526 the Demak forces seized the ports of Banten and the settlement of Banten Girang, led by Gunungjati, assisted by Hasanuddin and Ki Jongjo. Then, with the blessing of the Sultan of Demak, he became the ruler of Banten. Banten Girang was mentioned as Wahanten Girang in Carita Parahyangan, a late 16th century manuscript, which states that Wahanten Girang was defeated by Arya Bubrah, a figure interpreted as Fatahillah Khan, a military commander of Demak-Cirebon who also captured Sunda Kalapa. Gunungjati did not establish a new kingdom, but seized the throne from an existing Banten Girang polity. Hasanuddin ascended to the throne, succeeded the Sundanese king who in Portuguese sources was called as King Samiam (Sanghyang) which just passed away. This event marked as the founding of the Islamic Kingdom of Banten. Hasanuddin moved the royal capital from Banteng Girang several kilometres downstream to the port of Banten. Until the end of the 17th century, Banten Girang was still used as a resting palace or a retreat residence for Banten kings.

He was the co-founder and first director of the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg. Life and career Fisher was born in Konstanz and received his doctorate from Heidelberg University in 1936 with a thesis on the organization of labour in the German civil service. He worked as a journalist and during World War II served in the German army as a war reporter and propaganda officer in charge of the Panzer-Propaganda-Kompanie 697 unit. Under the name Dr. Joachim Fischer, he published and wrote for The Panzerfaust, the unit's propaganda magazine as did Heinz Heydrich. According to an account by Fischer published after the war, from 1942 to 1944 he and Heydrich participated in an underground operation that helped Jews escape from Berlin to Sweden via Copenhagen by providing them with forged identification and travel documents. The documents were printed in the Panzer-Propaganda-Kompanie's print works. The print works came under investigation in 1944 and the rescue operation was aborted. Shortly thereafter, Heydrich committed suicide. Fischer was eventually sentenced to a six-year prison term. Fischer's stepson, Hansg√ºnther Heyme, who was ten years old at the time, recalled that he and his mother had heard on the radio in early 1945 that Fischer had been executed at the prison in Torgau on the orders of Roland Freisler's People's Court. Several months later, Heyme was playing outside in Bad Kissingen when a bedraggled man appeared on a bicycle. It was Fischer. Although at one point Fischer had been sentenced to death, the radio broadcast had been a hoax. According to the obituary of Fischer by Eckhard Becker in the Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung, a Gauleiter and former Nazi student leader at Heidelberg university convinced Heinrich Himmler to commute his friend's death sentence to imprisonment. Fischer was eventually freed by the American and Soviet troops who had entered the town on 25 April 1945. After the war, the Fischer family settled in Heidelberg where Fischer wrote for many magazines and newspapers, especially about film and theatre. He also began writing screenplays which included those for Liebe 47, Wer fuhr den grauen Ford?, and Bernhard Wicki's debut film '. In 1952, he became the founding director of the Mannheim Cultural and Documentary Film Week, which later became the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg and served in that capacity until 1960. During his time there he was instrumental in getting the East German film company DEFA to participate in the festival. Later in his career he made television documentaries on the theatre directors Fritz Kortner and Erwin Piscator and served as a consultant on film funding to the German Interior Ministry.

Military career  After being drafted into the Red Army in 1941 Kostoev was sent to the Krasnodar School of Pilots. The German invasion of the Soviet Union began while he was a cadet at the school, but instead of being sent to the front immediately he was sent to Saratov and the Trans-baikal territory, where he mastered piloting the Ilyushin Il-2. He was deployed to the warfront in autumn 1944 as part of the 64th Attack Aviation Regiment, which had suffered losses but received new aircraft. Having made his first sortie in October, he completed 92 sorties by the end of the war. In his short amount of time on the warfront, he rose from the rank of starshina to junior lieutenant and was made a flight commander. On the day before Nazi Germany surrendered he managed to destroy a tank and a mortar battery. His Ingush nationality was likely a factor in him not being awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union; in 1945 he visited his exiled family in Kazakhstan, who were deported along with the rest of the Chechen and Ingush civilians during 1944.

After this incident, Arjuna went back to Australia, and Dharma left his don life. Dharma surrendered himself to the government, and he was thus leading a peaceful life. Back to the present, Mani sequesters Dharma and requests Arjuna to save Radhika who was abducted by a tribe, and in return, Mani promises to release his brother. Mani is in fact following Vedagiri's instruction. Arjuna then saves Radhika, who is still in love with him, but Vedagiri cannot forget the humiliation and wants to take revenge on Dharma and Arjuna. The Chief Minister (Arun Pandian) gives free rein to the police to end rowdyism and orders to encounter all the rowdies, including the reformed don Dharma. The police shot all the rowdies, including Mani and Dharma's right-hand man Kaaka (Bala Singh). The film ends with Dharma and Vedagiri shooting each other to death.

However, like many species in the family Polygonaceae, it has been placed in different genera within this group, including in Fallopia and Reynoutria. A 2015 molecular phylogenetic study (in which the species was treated as Fallopia cilinodis) found that it was weakly supported as a sister to the \\"DAP clade\\" (see the following cladogram), although plastid data alone placed it in the \\"RMF clade\\". The presence of extra-floral nectaries in Polygonum ciliinode suggests a relationship with the RMF clade, as this is one of the characteristics of the clade.

The Federated Society took advantage of the situation by renaming itself as the Federated Society of Electrotypers, Stereotypers and Assistants, and by the end of 1915, it had more than 1,800 members, including more than 1,000 in London. In 1917, the Federated Society renamed itself as the National Society of Electrotypers, Stereotypers and Assistants in 1917, and by 1919 it was sufficiently dominant that NATSOPA agreed to transfer its Electrotypers and Stereotypers section to the National Society. By the mid-1920s, membership had risen to 3,400, growing to a peak of more than 5,000 by the early 1960s. By this point the move away from letterpress printing and a fall in print advertising was reducing the number of jobs in the industry. In response, the society advocated that the six main unions in the trade, all members of the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, should merge. The idea was not taken up until many years later, but on 30 October 1967, the union merged into the National Graphical Association. General Secretaries :1911: Walter C.

Its dimensions are 419 √ó 283 cm. History and description The work was most probably performed during the Venetian period of Giordano and the two strongest influences that the Neapolitan painter had during his life are evident in the canvas. The lower part of the painting, characterized by the presence of the demons defeated by the archangel Michael, shows a clear rebellious imprint in the chiaroscuro features of the scene; while the upper part, characterized by the figure of the saint, shows evident influences of Venetian painting. The image of Saint Michael mirrors that of classical iconography, showing its spread wings, with a sword, with a heavenly dress and a red cape; intent on expelling the demons that came from the underworld on the earth. The only differences that there are with another painting to the same subject, always performed by Giordano a few years earlier (1663) and now kept at the Gem√§ldegalerie of Berlin, is that in this work of Vienna's saint is portrayed holding a sword instead of a lance and that his head is uncovered without helmet.

(c. 1931) Ludwig Franz Friedrich Georg Heck (11 August 1860 ‚Äì 17 July 1951) was a German zoologist who served as the director of Berlin Zoo from 1888 to 1931. He was the father of the zoologists Lutz and Heinz Heck. Heck was a national socialist and on his 80th birthday he was personally awarded the Goethe Medal for Art and Science by Adolf Hitler. Heck contributed to a revision of Brehm's Tierleben and a species of monkey, Heck's macaque and a subspecies of the long-tailed finch Poephila acuticauda hecki are named after him.  Life and work  1957 stamp commemorating Heck Heck was born in Darmstadt to Georg Heck, a teacher. He studied at the gymnasium at Darmstadt before going to the University of Strasbourg in 1878 followed by summer in the technical school at Darmstadt. Following his father's wishes he studied also at the Hessian State University, Giessen and then moved to Berlin in 1880. He then went to Leipzig where he completed his doctoral studies under the parasitologist Rudolf Leuckart. He received a doctorate in 1885-86 and obtained the position of director at Cologne Zoo from 1886. In the short time that he spent there, he improved the state of the zoo and earned a reputation. In 1888 he became the director of the Berlin Zoo succeeding Maximilian Schmidt (1885‚Äì1888) who died suddenly. Heck would serve until 1931, raising funds for the survival of the zoo through many trying times. The zoo had 924 species of birds and mammals at the end of 1890 and by 1914 it had 3500 animals of 1500 species. Through his connections with colonial German officers he obtained numerous animals, often wild caught. Heck took a special interest in the mental well-being of apes. Heck was extremely popular and wrote numerous articles. He wrote pamphlets for children in which he referred to himself as \\"Papa Heck\\". He maintained ties to many of the zoologists and scientists of the period including Hermann Klaatsch, Alfred Nehring, Bernhard Altum, Otto Kleinschmidt, Wilhelm B√∂lsche and his own colleagues Oskar Heinroth and Max Hilzheimer. He was succeeded as director of Berlin zoo by his son Lutz Heck. Heck was during his time as director of the Berlin zoo responsible for its survival although he resisted moving to the Carl Hagenbeck model of avoiding cages and using moats.  Personal life  Heck married Margarete Nauwerk from Cologne and they had two daughters and their sons Lutz and Heinz. Heck was a friend of many powerful politicians. In a 1938 article on man and nature he wrote about \\"our upheaval and then rebirth, our exceptional F√ºhrer and his hardly less exceptional assistants have lifted a real weight from my shoulders, in that they have organized our state‚Äî the first in the world!‚Äî on the basis of the natural sciences, on the basis of blood and soil‚Äù and he noted further that his sons looked upon him as a \\"National Socialist\\" even before the word had been invented. His son Lutz, was a member of the National Socialist party and hunting friend of Hermann G√∂ring. A bust was made of him at the Berlin zoo in 1954 and unveiled by Katharina Heinroth despite threats from anti-Nazi protesters. He was a member of the Leopoldina Academy from 1895. His wife died in 1950 and he died in Munich on July 17, 1951, which would have been their 63rd wedding anniversary. Heck contributed to the fourth edition of the mammals volume of Brehm's Tierleben (1911).

From 1969 to 2019 Israel had issued over 1,150 military seizure orders alone to that purpose. Overview The mechanisms by which Israel seizes or expropriates West Bank land were set forth in a detailed work by B'Tselem in 2002 and many practices outlined there were confirmed in the official Israeli Sasson Report of 2005, which focused on government subsidies and support for the creation of illegal Israeli outposts in knowing contravention of Israel's own laws. This was done after the government had officially frozen new settlements, in both the Oslo Accords and an undertaking by Ariel Sharon. Mechanisms According to the analysis made by B'Tselem in 2002, there have been five mechanisms adopted to take over Palestinian land. Seizure for Military Needs According to Customary international humanitarian law the expropriation of residents' property by an occupying power is prohibited, except for temporary possession. Israel justified its initial requisitions of West Bank land as necessary for urgent military needs. Much private land was seized and expropriated nonetheless to create settlements, and justified on the grounds that even civilian settlements strengthen the security of an area. A High Court decision regarding Elon Moreh then banned this sequester of private Palestinian land for settlements. Subsequently, however expropriations continued, to build numerous bypass roads to settlements, with security needs cited, and this was endorsed by the Israeli court as legitimate. According to a 2019 study by Dror Etkes, military seizure orders, based on military and security requirements, have resulted in the expropriation of over 100,000 dunams (25,000 acres) of Palestinian land. 40% of such temporary requisitions have then been turned over to settlements. Down to 1977, 28% of the ruling Labour Government's orders were used for settlement, while after the Likud party's victory, from 1977-1979, the figure ran to 73%. Employment of the Ottoman Law Code of 1858 Israel's solution adopted in the wake of this legal precedent, which might have thwarted further settlement, was to cite the Ottoman Land Law of 1858 to justify the seizure of 40% of the West Bank on the grounds that the terrain was \\"state land\\". Israel's justification here was posited on its interpretations of articles 43 and 55 of the 1907 Hague Regulations and a 1967 order to possess and manage at the military commander's discretion \\"enemy property,\\" namely Jordan's. (Jordan had annexed the West Bank in 1950, which Israel captured from Jordan in 1967). The first seizure took over 13% of the West Bank, and then the possession of lands in Ottoman law which the Israeli authorities identified as certain varieties of miri and mawat land, which altogether amounted to 26% of the West Bank. This ensured a huge reserve for future settlement. In seeking legal redress for such expropriations, the burden of proof lay on Palestinian plaintiffs. Palestinians in practice had often avoided registering their property under the Ottomans, preferring their local collective ownership system (musha'a), thua evading Ottoman taxes and army drafts. Even if the burden of proof of ownership is met, the appeal may be denied if the Israeli custodian had in the meantime transferred the land to a settlement. The precise extent of Islamic Waqf lands ‚Äì Islamic property held in sacred trust for religious purposes ‚Äì in 1967 is unknown but in 1992 Michael Dumper calculated West Bank waqf properties extended over 600,000 dunams. By 2013 the Israeli occupation authorities were estimated to have expropriated more than 104,996 dunams of waqf holdings, mostly around Jericho. Israel seized, by declaring it state land, even non-arable hilltop land used by pastoralists. The lands of the village of Umm al-Khair were expropriated in this way. Absentee Property Palestinian property owned but abandoned before, during, or after the 1967 war is administered by the Custodian for Abandoned Property- its trustee, on behalf of the IDF, until the owner returns. In practice repatriation of absentee owners is generally prohibited.(citation needed) Even if an appellant can prove he owns this land, and is resident in the West Bank, he cannot retake possession if in the meantime the Custodian has allowed it to be settled, as in the case of Beit Horon. In the Burqan case, where the plaintiff Mohammad Burqan's legal title to his former house in the Jewish Quarter was recognized, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected his request to be allowed to return to his home on the grounds that the area it was located in had \\"special historical significance\\" for Jews. Expropriation for Public Needs Jordanian law required intended appropriations of property to be gazetted to allow land owners 15 days to appeal. Israel adopted part of this law dealing with urgent expropriations for the public weal, modifying the general thrust by cancelling the provision regarding prior notification which remained in effect for 12 years. Any appeal, in Jordanian law under the jurisdiction of a local court, was to be made before the Israeli military commander. On appeal, Israel then was obliged to notify, but did so only to the local mukhtar, not to the person(s) affected. This, with the exception of Ma'ale Adumim, has been used to expropriate land for the road network servicing settlements, which Israel justified by claiming in court they also serviced local Palestinian needs. Of 40,000 dunams redefined for allocation to 45 settlements, in one study of 73 seizure orders, less than half (43%) is actually used for built-up areas or in settlement agriculture. The remaining 57% percent, technically Palestinian land under temporary requisition for military purposes, stands empty. Since a court judgement in 1989, seized land must bear an expiration date for the appropriation. On expiry, new orders are issued to enable extensions. Acquisition of Land on the Free Market Military order no.25 placed severe restrictions on land sales in the West Bank and for a decade only the Jewish National Fund engaged in purchases. It is forbidden under Palestinian law and custom to sell land to Jews, a fact which entailed creating a variety of methods to transfer property without the sale being visible for long periods. Thereafter, changes in the law introduced by Likud created hundreds of cases of fraudulent sales, ‚Äì with numerous Palestinians finding the land they worked apparently sold only when they observed tractors at work on the properties ‚Äì a practice formally stopped in 1985. 1967 to recent times In the wake of the 1967 war, especially under the Likud governments (1977-1984), apart from expropriation, land requisitioning, zoning regulations and some purchases, Israel introduced legal definitions of what was to be regarded as \\"public\\" and what \\"private\\" land in the conquered territories. With Military Order Number 59 issued on 31 July 1967 the Israeli commander asserted that therein state land would be whatever land had belonged to the enemy (Jordan) or its judicial bodies. Sweeping restrictions were imposed requiring military authorization for any land transactions. Rather than assuming the task of being the custodian of that property until the occupation ended, Israel chose to transfer the use of unregistered land to Jewish settlers, and on that basis, from 1967 to 1984 the Israeli government requisitioned an estimated 5,500,000 dunams, or roughly half of the total area of the West Bank, setting aside much of the land for military training and camping areas. By defining such areas as \\"state land\\" its use by Palestinians was precluded. The first wave of land confiscations outside Jerusalem's walls began in January 1968, when 3,800 dunums of private Palestinian land were expropriated for Kalandia industrial park and to enable the building of 6,000 apartments in the areas of French Hill and Ramat Eshkol. By 1983 the expropriation was calculated to extend over 52% of the territory, most of its prime agricultural land and, just before the 1993 Oslo Accords, these confiscations had encompassed over three quarters of the West Bank. Many of these early expropriations took place over private Palestinian land. This led to a complaint over a settlement at Elon Moreh, and the Supreme Court ruled such practices were forbidden except for military purposes, civilians only being permitted on what Israel defined as \\"state land\\". This ruling actually enhanced the settlement project since anywhere Israelis settled automatically became a security zone requiring the military to guarantee their safety. One technique used in the Jordan Valley to gain more land is via the declaration of \\"firing zone[s]\\" (35% of the area) which require residents working the land to evacuate temporarily. From January 2013 to 2017, 140 orders were issued to have communities leave their homes, with their flocks, sometimes in mid-winter. In addition water tankers, pipelines for spring water, solar panels and farm machinery are confiscated causing upheavals in their local economy and persistent insecurity about their future. The Israeli settlements occupy no more than 0.0041% of the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea but the land allocated for their future use as municipal areas is 28 times greater, covering 11.8% of the total area. \\"State Land\\" declarations in the Gush Etzion settlement area (Bethlehem) Ariel was initially built on 462 hectares originally seized for security reasons. On the three successive occasions when security fences have been raised, they have incorporated hundreds of dunams of private Palestinian agricultural property. Land where pastoralists from Marda used to graze 10,000 animals were taken, leaving the village with land that can barely carry 100 head of livestock. Likewise at Tel Rumeida in 2015, a military closure guaranteed settlers free passage while Palestinians are denied access to visit those residents who remain. Another technique used was to offer a Palestinian proprietor a temporary swap, in which he leased his land for 3 years in exchange for a lease on absentee-owned land in the hands of the Israeli custodian. Such leases were not renewed after expiry, but, as with the case of Mehola, the Palestinian property leased became a permanent Israeli asset, while the absentee property offered in exchange technically could revert to its original owners if they returned (from Jordan) leaving the original Palestinian party to the contract landless. One innovative technique in 1999 came from settlers complaining of poor cellphone reception. They pointed out a nearby hill, which they had unsuccessfully tried to colonize earlier, as an appropriate site for antennae. It was a biblical site, moreover, they claimed, though excavations only yielded Byzantine ruins. The IDF declared the antennae would pose a security issue, and then expropriated the site from its owners, the villagers of Burqa and Ein Yabrud, who grazed sheep and cultivated figs and grapes there. Settlers then moved in and established the illegal outpost of Migron. Using the Ottoman law code regarding miri lands (only 4% of the land north of Beersheva), which held that if were not worked for 3 consecutive years without a lawful excuse they reverted to the state, Israel dispossessed, by declaring it state land, even non-arable hilltop land used by pastoralists. The lands of the village of Umm al-Khair were expropriated in this way. In the Burqan case, where the plaintiff Mohammad Burqan's legal title to his former house in the Jewish Quarter was recognized, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected his request to be allowed to return to his home on the grounds that the area it was located in had \\"special historical significance\\" for Jews. The precise extent of Islamic Waqf lands ‚Äì Islamic property held in sacred trust for religious purposes ‚Äì in 1967 is unknown but in 1992 Michael Dumper calculated West Bank waqf properties extended over 600,000 dunams. By 2013 the Israeli occupation authorities were estimated to have expropriated more than 104,996 dunams of waqf holdings, mostly around Jericho. Legal redress Legal redress for expropriated land exists, but the process can prove lengthy, and financially and mentally exhausting for villagers. Israeli human rights activists who try to encourage harassed Palestinians to resist expropriation, such as David Dean Shulman, rabbi Arik Ascherman, Amiel Vardi and Ezra Nawi have often been beaten up by settlers who regard them as \\"Nazis\\". Nawi himself has been imprisoned.

Mill is best known as the founder of the modern Bengal cat breed: Mill successfully crossed the wild Asian leopard cat with a domestic cat, and then backcrossed the offspring through five generations to create the domestic Bengal. Mill made contributions in two other cat breeds: the Himalayan and the standardized version of the Egyptian Mau. Jean and her first husband Robert Sugden were involved in a precedent-setting case about the United States government's power to monitor short wave radio communications. Jean Mill has also authored two books. Conservation efforts and breeding rationale Jean Mill was concerned about the hunting and poaching of the Asian Leopard cats to supply the fur and pet trades. Mill has said that her desire to save the Asian Leopard cat led to the creation of the Bengal cat breed. Mill claimed that she started crossing Asian Leopard cats with domestic cats to help prevent poaching. She gave two reasons for her breeding rationale: if people could purchase a cat that looked like a wild leopard, the actual Asian Leopard mothers would not be killed in the wild for fur; and the cubs would not be taken to be sold to customers. Himalayan cat contributions In 1948, Jean Mill worked to develop the Himalayan cat, a longhaired breed of mixed Persian and Siamese ancestry. She said she originated the breed by 1954 and was showing off her prizewinning cats by 1960. Creating the Bengal breed There were several other breeders involved in developing the Bengal breed, most notably Pat Warren, William Engle and Willard Centerwall. Jean Mill is considered the originator of the breed because she created a domestic Bengal past the F4 generation, and then tirelessly promoted the new breed. 1960s: Mill's first hybrid cat In 1963 Mill lived in Yuma Arizona: it was there that Mill crossed a domestic tomcat with an Asian leopard cat. This mating was thought to be the first documented mating of a Wild Asian Leopard to a Domestic cat. The leopard cat Mill used was a spotted five to twelve pound shy wild cat species from Asia. Jean Sudgen purchased a female Asian Leopard cat (named Malaysia) from a pet store in 1961. She put a black domestic tomcat in her cage. The animals mated and produced two kittens, a male and a female called KinKin. 1970s In 1970 Mill restarted her breeding program and in 1975 she received of a group of Bengal cats which had been bred for use in Loma Linda, CA by Willard Centerwall. When Centerwall concluded his studies he gifted the cats from the study to Jean Mill. Mill used these hybrids from Centerwall in her Bengal breeding program. 1982 Spotted domestic cats from India The curator of the New Delhi Zoo also gave Mill the sister of the cat in the rhinoceros cage which Mill named Tasha of New Delhi. These two Indian domestic cats Toby and Tasha contributed greatly to the Bengal breed. 1982 Spotted domestic cats from India Mill's breeding efforts began to take shape in the 1980s. In 1982 Mill obtained a spotted domestic cat from a shelter. Later in 1982, while traveling in India, Mill found another spotted domestic cat living in a zoo. The zookeepers captured the orange spotted cat (later named Toby of Delhi) and gave him to Mill. When Mill returned to the United States she used the orange spotted cat from the zoo along with the spotted cat from the pound, to breed with the hybrid cats she received. Egyptian Mau breeding Mill registered Millwood Tory of Delhi as an Egyptian Mau. Mill also imported other Egyptian Mau kittens from India. Mill also needed males to stud the F1 and F2 kittens resulting from the Asian Leopard cat since hybrid males are often sterile. Mill also used Egyptian Maus to raise her F1 Bengal kittens. Several Egyptian Mau breeders, used Millwood Tory of Delhi 'Indian Mau' genes to improve upon the weak, inbred, poor tempered, poor producing bloodlines. In 1985 Jean Mill's Egyptian Mau line was retracted by the CFA. Eventually they all reinstated and the bloodline is now used extensively in modern Egyptian Maus. Glitter in the Bengal cat, Egyptian Mau and Toyger breeds originates from a single cat: Millwood Tory of Delhi. Tory was used as a stud in the background of all three breeds. Bengal cat breeding resumed Mill combined her spotted domestic cats with the Centerwall cats and with that Mill was able to restart her Bengal breeding program: where others breeders had failed to get the Bengal breed established because of the sterility of the F1,F2, F3, and F4 early generation Bengals, Jean Mill succeeded. Mill successfully backcrossed Bengals until she achieved the F5 Bengal with a domestic cat temperament. The modern Bengal breed traces to cats bred by Jean Mill in the early 1980s. Others also began breeding Bengals ‚Äì and in 1986 The International Cat Association (TICA) accepted the Bengal cat as a new breed: Bengals gained championship status in 1991. Where other early Bengal breeders like William Engle only succeeded in creating a sterile hybrid, Jean Mill succeeded in creating a Domestic Bengal cat. Jean Mill's cattery was called Millwood. One of her earliest customers was a breeder named Gene Ducote of Gogees Bengals. Ducote has said one of her favorite Jean Mill quotes is: \\"Beauty always wins out...\\" Education Jean Mill earned a degree from Pomona College in psychology in 1945. Mill attended graduate classes in genetics at UC Davis in 1946. At U.C. Davis Mill wrote a term paper which proposed crossing the popular Persian breed of cat with the new Siamese breed to make 'Panda Bear' cats. Personal life Jean Mill was born May 14, 1926 in Des Moines. Mill moved to California to attend college and by 1948 was one of three breeders working to develop the Himalayan cat, a longhaired breed of mixed Persian and Siamese ancestry. Jean Mill married a wealthy rancher and cotton farmer named Robert Sugden and moved to his ranch in Yuma, Arizona. In 1949, she was queen of the Yuma Jaycees' fourth annual rodeo. After Robert Sugden died in 1965, she move into an apartment and put her conservation/breeding efforts on hold. The Sugden's had a daughter (Judith Alice Sugden) October 15, 1948. United States of America v. Robert V. H. Sugden and Jean S. Sugden On October 7, 1953, Jean Mill and her first husband Robert Sugden were both indicted for conspiracy to violate the immigration laws. The main government evidence was obtained by listening to the Sugdens' shortwave radio communications. The U.S. Government alleged that the Sugdens used shortwave radio broadcasts to warn their foremen to hide their illegal-alien workers. The Federal Communications Commission suspended the Sugdens' Radio Telephone Operating permit. Robert Sugden alone was indicted for concealing and shielding illegal entrants into the United States from detection. The charges revolved around allegations of employing Mexican nationals...It is alleged that the Sugdens took various steps to hide the illegal entrants and avoid being caught with them in their employ.\\" Judge Ling dismissed the charges in the spring of 1954 because the case Judge determined that short wave radio evidence was not obtained legally. The Government then appealed the dismissal of evidence to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit since they had merely monitored short wave radio broadcasts of the Sugdens (not wiretapped). In 1955 the United States was able to win their appeal to get the short wave radio evidence admitted in the case against the Sugdens. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that because the Sugdens were not licensed to operate the short wave radio at the time of the broadcasts; the FCC may make full disclosure to the Immigration service . Jean Mill got married a second time to John Krummel and together they lived in Pasadena, California until they divorced. In 1975, Mill married engineer Robert James Mill in Los Angeles County, California, and moved to his one-acre horse property in Covina Hills, California. Jean Mill and Bob Mill continued to live in California and they bred Bengal cats under the name Millwood. Bob Mill died September 21, 1999. Death and legacy Jean Mill died on June 6, 2018. Mill created a domestic Bengal cat with markings like a leopard and the temperament of a house cat in order to protect wild cats from overhunting. It is unknown what impact the Jean Mill's Bengal cat breed had on the fur industry. It is known that fur fell out of fashion in the United States. \\"More than 60% of Americans find killing animals for fur amounts to cruelty, according to an Angus Reid survey.\\" As of 2019, Bengal breeders number in the thousands. Jean Mill got the Bengal cat accepted into TICA in 1986. Since that time Bengals have been accepted into all of the cat registries: CFA, FIFe, WCF, ACF, ACFA/CAA, QCCF, and New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF). Jean Mill also inspired her daughter Judy Sugden to create a new cat breed, the Toyger.

The film stars Lily Collins, Simon Pegg, Connie Nielsen, Chace Crawford and Patrick Warburton. Inheritance was released on May 22, 2020, by Vertical Entertainment and received generally negative reviews from critics. Plot In 2008, Archer Monroe (Patrick Warburton), the patriarch of a wealthy and powerful political family in New York City, passes away suddenly. Archer's estate is divided among his family: Catherine (Connie Nielsen), his wife; William (Chace Crawford), his son, a politician running for reelection; and Lauren (Lily Collins), his daughter, a Manhattan District Attorney. Privately, the family attorney Harold Thewlis (Michael Beach) gives Lauren a message from her father that leads her to a secret bunker beneath the family property, where she finds a stranger (Simon Pegg) being held in captivity. The man identifies himself as Morgan Warner and says he's been held prisoner for thirty years. While Morgan is sleeping, Lauren takes a sample of his fingerprints and sends them for identification. Morgan claims he was once a friend and business partner of Archer's, until one night when they were driving drunk and ended up killing a pedestrian. At Archer's insistence, they covered up the crime before Archer took Morgan prisoner to stop him exposing the murder. In the intervening years, Archer treated Morgan like a confessor and admitted many of his secrets. Morgan directs Lauren to where the pedestrian's body is buried. Lauren also follows Morgan's clues and finds Archer's longtime mistress, with whom he had a son, as well as evidence that Archer paid bribes to get his children elected to public office. Lauren is eventually convinced to set Morgan free, and directs Harold to set up an offshore bank account and charter a private jet so Morgan can disappear. Lauren's fingerprints come back with a match and the file is sent to the Monroe house. Catherine finds the file and is terrified by the sight of Morgan, whom she identifies as \\"Carson\\" and calls an \\"evil man\\". Lauren also discovers that Harold has been murdered, and by the time she returns to the Monroe house, Carson has abducted Catherine and taken her to the bunker. Carson subdues Lauren and it's revealed that thirty years ago, Carson drugged and raped Catherine, and Archer was taking Carson somewhere to kill him when they ran down the pedestrian; furthermore, Carson was responsible for Archer's death, using poison Archer had intended to use on him. Lauren fights back and, in their struggle, Carson claims he is really Lauren's biological father before Catherine seizes his gun and shoots him dead. Together, Lauren and Catherine pour gasoline throughout the bunker and set it alight, destroying all evidence of Carson's captivity.

A fight breaks out, resulting in Karan getting thrown out of the house by an explosion. The video goes viral, and so does Bhavana's tweet supporting Karan. It is soon revealed to be a part of Karan's plan when he releases a video of himself challenging Buraq without disclosing his identity. When Buraq's DNA matches with that of a murder suspect, Karan and his team rush to Buraq's restaurant but find him gone. Realizing he would have gone to pick up his son from school, Karan arrives there and challenges him before the latter disappears. Back in Mumbai, the two suspects are reformed by a Muslim saint. Buraq is unwilling to let go of his son and soon finds himself exposed when Karan holds a press conference with Abeer and Zahira. While the mother and son are being escorted safely to the airport for India, Buraq's henchmen attack the vehicles. Bhavana is knocked out in the crash while Karan and Mallika fight off the henchmen. However, Zahira and Abeer are kidnapped and Mallika is informed about Buraq's surrender. Karan tries to interrogate him but ends up using force due to which he is ordered to leave London within 24 hours. Buraq is freed due to making a deal with the BI; he gives them evidence for a previous attack in exchange for his freedom. On his way to a safe house, Buraq asks the officers to stop at a mosque so that he can pray. He switches places with one of his henchmen and kills Zahira. Realizing the attack would be not on Diwali but before it, Karan decides to continue alone but is joined by his team. Through Abeer's tablet, the safe house is located and attacked by Karan and team. Following the fight that leaves all the henchmen dead, Karan injects Buraq and takes him away as he is unconscious. Bhavana and Mallika rescue Abeer, while Karan is safely picked up by his agency's helicopter and escorted to a cargo ship heading towards India. With minimal time remaining for the attacks, Karan and the police try to find the targeted cities. Decoding \\"ALLAH\\" spoken repeatedly by Buraq, Karan finds the targeted cities and releases a video requesting the Muslims of India to understand the value of religious unity. When Muslims gear up to face the terrorists, they are joined by the police officers and terrorists are arrested. Karan kills Buraq, and hands over Abeer to the dead suspect's father.

D'Addario worked as a freelance photographer from 1938, turning his hobby into his profession. He enlisted in the United States Army before it entered the Second World War; after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he was assigned to London as an army photographer. Selected to cover the Nuremberg trials along with other members of the military imaging service team, D‚ÄôAddario was the most prolific of them. He had to face the restrictions for the taking of images imposed by the court, including among others not using a flash. The thousands of images he took, both in black and white and color, were those published in all international press coverage of the 21 defendants, some of them notable for starting their own discourse. Although his work was best known for his images of the defendant's bench, he also took singular images of the prosecutors, some silent motion pictures of the court itself, and the city of Nuremberg, devastated by the allied bombings in the war.

Facing persecution under the Nazi regime she sought refuge in Britain during the Second World War before establishing herself in Austria in the 1950s. Biography Goldschmidt was born in Leipzig into a middle-class Jewish family who had several artistic connections. The family knew the writers Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann and also the painter Marianne von Werefkin and her partner Alexei Jawlensky. From 1914 to 1917, Goldschmidt studied book design at the Leipzig Academy under Hugo Steiner Prag and produced woodcuts and lithographs in an expressionist style. She also took private painting lessions with O R Bossert and dance lessions at the Leipzig Opera ballet school as well as writing poetry. In 1918 the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts began admitting women students for the first time and Goldschmidt studied painting there from 1920 to 1923 during which time she was taught by Oskar Kokoschka. Goldschmidt lived a somewhat cosmopolitan life after graduating from the Dresden Academy. Between 1923 and 1932 she spent part of each year in Paris and then spent the summer in the south of France before returning to Leipzig for the winter. She exhibited works in New York in 1923 and rented a studio in Montparnasse. Her first solo exhibition was held at the Gallery Caspari in Munich in 1932 but was closed down by the authorities. Facing increased discrimination and persecution under the Nazi regime in Germany, Goldschmidt and her mother moved to Kitzb√ºhel in the Austrian Tyrol in 1933 and both became Austrian citizens in 1936. Following the Anschluss, the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, they moved to London in 1939. Arriving in London in 1939, Goldschmidt and her mother set up a small business, the Golly Studio, making and selling gloves and mittens to give themselves an income. A short holiday in the Lake District led them to move north and settle on the Langdale Estate near Ambleside. There they found themselves among an artistic community that included several other refugees, most notably the artist Kurt Schwitters, who became a close friend and influence on her work. In the Lake District, Goldschmidt continued to run Golly Studios, gave evening classes in leatherwork and continued to paint. She painted expressionist landscapes in bright pastel colours and also portraits such as Awake and Dreaming, showing a women deep in melancholic introspection. A self-portrait from this time, in which Goldschmidt depicts herself as a sphinx, albeit one set in an English landscape, is now in the Tate collection. In 1949, Goldschmidt had a solo show in Manchester and later that year, after her mother had died, returned to Kitzb√ºhel. In Austria, Goldschmidt attempted to run a guest house for a number of years but after taking classes with her old teacher Oskar Kokoschka in 1954, she decided to concentrate full-time on her art. Her paintings became bolder and more structured often with thick black lines surrounding bold blocks of colour. Trips to Venice in the 1960s and to Israel in 1968 led to sets of silk screen prints, including Israel: Man and Country. Trips to Malta and Gozo also provided inspiration. Goldschmidt had several solo exhibitions in both Austria and England, notably at Annely Juda Fine Art in 1969 and at the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in Kendal during 1973. That exhibition subsequently toured venues in the north of England. Examples of her work featured in the exhibition Condemned, Forgotten, Rediscovered. The Fate of Expressive Art in the 20th Century held at the Cultural and Historical Museum in Osnabr√ºck in 2001 which concentrated on artists whose work was suppressed under the Nazi regime. A joint exhibition of works by Goldschmidt and Schwitters was held at the Abbot Hall Art Gallery in 2003 and both feature in Abbot Hall's 2019 exhibition Refuge: The Art of Belonging.

Consumption and monitoring of sensors is done in the userland with the help of sysctl, systat, sensorsd, ntpd, snmpd, ports/sysutils/symon and GKrellM.  Drivers  In OpenBSD, the framework is integrated with Dell's ESM, IPMI and I¬≤C, in addition to a number of popular Super I/O chips through . A major difference compared to other solutions like lm_sensors is simplicity and a works-by- default approach in the drivers, which don't require nor support any configurability; no installation or configuration actions are required by the system administrator in order to get the sensors going. This is coupled with a fine-tuned ad-hoc read-only scan procedure on the I¬≤C bus, written by Theo de Raadt in a centralised way with a cache, making it possible to leave it enabled by default at all times, unlike the competing solutions.  RAID \`drive\` sensors  Support for automatic monitoring of RAID drives is also provided through the sensors framework, this concept of sensors of \`drive\` type has been backported by NetBSD back into envsys in .  OpenNTPD \`timedelta\` sensors  OpenNTPD uses sensors of type \`timedelta\` in order to synchronise time. These are provided by NMEA and other drivers.  History  The framework was originally devised in 2003 by Alexander Yurchenko, when he was porting several envsys-based drivers from NetBSD. Instead of porting NetBSD's envsys, a simpler sysctl-based mechanism was developed. The framework received a major uptick in usage by the device drivers with the release of OpenBSD 3.9, where in a period of merely 6 months, the number of individual drivers using the framework went from 9 in OpenBSD 3.8 (released ) to 33 in OpenBSD 3.9 (released ). , the framework was used by 44 devices drivers; it is at this time that a patchset has been committed converting a simple one-level addressing scheme into a more stable multi-layer addressing. In 2007, the framework was ported to FreeBSD as part of a Google Summer of Code grant; it has been adopted by DragonFly BSD later that year. The usability of the , the sensors monitoring daemon, has been vastly improved in 2007, partly due to same GSoC grant. , the total number of drivers stood at 68 in OpenBSD 4.4; growing by 7 drivers in a 6-month release cycle. This level of growth, of one new driver per month on average, has been common throughout the history of the framework since OpenBSD 3.9. The values exported by the drivers through the framework are read-only; however, an external patch exists that implements the fan control functionality in both the framework as well as one of the drivers for the most popular family of Super I/O chips; this patchset was provided for both OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD.

She is senior research fellow in physics and senior research investigator in the Department of Physics at Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine. She was the senior tutor for women students at Imperial College, and played a leading role in starting the Imperial College Day Nursery.  Early life and education  Born Lady Anne Patricia Pery, she attended Chelsea Polytechnic, where she sat the London University Intermediate examination in Physics, Chemistry, Pure and Applied Mathematics in 1946. This qualification enabled her to join Oxford University in 1947, where she was a member of St Hugh's College, Oxford. She received a BA Hons degree in Physics and Mathematics in 1950 and stayed on for a further four years as a post-graduate.  Career  After graduating and receiving her PhD, Thorne undertook a year-long research fellowship at Harvard University, where she worked with Professor Norman Ramsey. In 1955, Thorne joined Imperial College as an assistant lecturer in the Physics department. She was promoted to lecturer in Physics in 1956 and again in 1968 to senior lecturer. During her time at Imperial College, she was first person to take up the role of senior tutor for women students and successfully argued for the implementation of the Day Nursery, which opened in 1970. In the 1970s, Thorne worked on vacuum-ultraviolet interferometry and oscillator strengths by Mach‚ÄìZehnder interferometry, and in 1974, she published the academic text book Spectrophysics, which was subsequently rewritten as Spectrophysics: Principles and Applications in 1999. During her tenure at Imperial, Thorne's main non- scientific voluntary work was to improve education. She served on the Governing Boards of 8 different schools and Colleges, both State and Independent. She was the Chairman of Governors of Ardingly College for 5 years.  Retirement and legacy  Thorne retired in 1993, becoming senior research fellow in physics, and then senior research investigator in physics. Imperial College awards a prize named for Anne Thorne each year to a student whose PhD thesis in experimental physics is concerned with the development or use of new experimental instruments or techniques.

He is the founder and CEO of Baring Vostok, a Russian investment company. Michael Calvey and five colleagues were arrested in Russia in February 2019, for allegedly defrauding Russian businessman Artem Avetisyan, who is an associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Calvey maintains the charges are baseless, supported by a BBC investigation, and the real reason for the arrest was because Calvey was suing Avetisyan in a separate business dispute in London, and winning, so Avetisyan used his connections with Putin and the FSB to have Calvey arrested on trumped up charges. If Calvey is convicted Avetisyan stands to gain 10s of millions, and Calvey faces 10 years in the notorious Matrosskaya Tishina, the same prison where Sergei Magnitsky died under mysterious circumstances. The same judge who prosecuted Magnitsky is assigned to the Calvey case. Biography Michael Calvey was born in 1967 in Oklahoma. He has a master's degree in finance and accounting from the London School of Economics. He worked for Salomon Brothers and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He is a board member on the Atlantic Council. Calvey founded the financial investment firm Baring Vostok in 1994, and since then has invested over $2.8 billion into over eighty Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) companies. Investments included in financial services, oil and gas, telecommunications, and media. According to Bloomberg, \\"Calvey became a legend in the Russian market, in part because of his reputed aversion to any kind of foul play and focus on industries and companies unlikely to attract the attention of Russia‚Äôs authorities.\\" Calvey is fluent in Russian language. Calvey was arrested on 14 February 2019, with three other Baring Vostok executives, on suspicion of allegedly embezzling 2.5 billion rubles (US$38 million) from the Russian Vostochny Bank. On 21 February, Russian state prosecutors formally charged him with fraud. The man \\"behind Calvey's arrest\\" was Russian business associate Artem Avetisyan, a Vostochny shareholder. As of February 2019, Calvey's Baring Vostok had a majority stake of 52.5% in Vostochny Bank. Avetisyan is a close friend of the son of Nikolai Patrushev, former Director of the FSB and secretary of Putin's Security Council. Calvey was suing Avetisyan in a separate court case in London, and winning, and Calvey maintains the charges against him were trumped up by Avetisyan who used his connections with Nikolai Patrushev to have Calvey arrested and thus unable to effectively defend himself in the London case; Avetisyan would also stand to gain 10s of millions of dollars. On 22 February 2019, Radio Echo of Moscow interviewed BBC Russian Service correspondent Olga Shamina, who claimed that the case against Calvey is based on two documents described in a BBC Russian Service publication on its website. One is said to be a statement by Vostochny Bank minority shareholder Sherzod Yusupov, the other an assessment by lawyers in Luxembourg commissioned by Artem Avetisyan. Calvey faces at least 10 years in jail. Calvey was held in Seaman's Silence Prison, the facility notorious for poor conditions and treatment ‚Äî it is the same prison where lawyer Sergei Magnitsky was detained and died under mysterious circumstances. Likewise, Calvey's case was assigned to Arthur Karpov, the same detective who prosecuted Magnitsky. Neither the United States Trump administration, nor the Department of Justice, have taken any action or protest beyond acknowledging the case exists. In April 2019, Calvey was released to a restricted form of house arrest, although a number of colleagues remain in prison. It is reported that Putin has personally taken the case \\"under his control\\", though Putin acknowledges \\"the law is the law\\" implying he is not in control.

She worked at the John Innes Horticultural Institution (now the John Innes Centre) for over 20 years.  Life  De Winton worked as a professional gardener from 1916 until 1919, before approaching William Bateson with an interest in studying plants in a more scientific manner. She thus became one of the 'Bateson Ladies' at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in 1920, joining Caroline Pellew, Dorothy Cayley, Alice Gairdner, Aslaug Sverdrup and Irma Andersson in the so-called 'Ladies Lab'. From 1920 until 1926, De Winton worked with Bateson on Chinese primrose (Primula sinensis), continuing the work of Reginald Gregory. During this time period, in 1923, she co-authored 'Genetics of Primula sinensis', describing linkage studies for numerous traits in Primula sinensis. While in the 'Ladies Lab', De Winton also worked on genetic linkage in Pisum with Caroline Pellew, and the two women presented their studies at the International Congress of Genetics in Berlin in 1927. Diagram of heredity in Primula sinensis from a study published by William Bateson in 1909 From 1927, De Winton worked closely with the geneticist J. B. S. Haldane. She continued her work on Primula, resulting in the discovery of 20 new mutants and further publications on primrose genetics. In 1929, De Winton was officially named a geneticist at the John Innes Horticultural Institution. In 1932 De Winton published a book on her work titled 'Leaf and Bract Forms of Primula Sinensis and their Inheritance', following that with 'The Genetics of Primula sinensis: IV. Indications as to the Ontogenetic Relationship of Leaf and Inflorescence' with Edgar Anderson in 1935. She also published a study on self-sterility and self-fertility in Nicotiana with Anderson in 1931. De Winton left the John Innes Horticultural Institution in 1941, following the appointment of Cyril Darlington as the director of the institute in 1939. Changes made by Darlington resulted in a reduction in her pay which she found unacceptable, resulting in her resignation (together with Caroline Pellew). Following this, De Winton worked at Messrs Ballard in Worcestershire as a plant breeder. Dorothea De Winton passed away in 1982.

The union was founded in 1854 as the London Association of Correctors of the Press. At first a very small organisation, it grew gradually to 174 members in 1884, and 483 in 1898. By 1903, it was able to appoint a full-time general secretary, and selected S. F. Crampin. The union dropped \\"London\\" from its name in 1905, and registered with the government in 1907. It continued to grow, peaking at 1,500 members by the late 1920s. The union long had demarcation disputes with the London Society of Compositors (LSC); the ACP argued that proofreading was a profession which required the completion of an apprenticeship and the passing of examinations which it set, while the LSC believed that proofreading was a skill which compositors could learn through informal experience. As a result, while the ACP was recognised in the majority of newspaper offices in London, a large minority recognised only the LSC. In both 1912 and 1924, the ACP organised a merger with the LSC, but on both occasions this was voted down by the ACP's members. Only in 1952 did the unions finally reach a formal agreement on their jurisdictions. In 1965, the ACP merged into the National Graphical Association. General Secretaries :1854: J. M. Philp :1855: R.

Part of almost every modern naval ship, they are also widely used on maritime patrol aircraft and naval helicopters. When mounted on an aircraft, they are sometimes known by the British terminology, Air-to-Surface Vessel radar, or ASV for short. Similar radars are also widely used on civilian ships and even small pleasure craft, in which case they are more commonly known as marine radar. As with conventional surveillance radars, these systems detect objects by listening for the reflections of a radio signal off target objects, especially metal. The range of a surface search radar is greatly increased compared to other roles due to several aspects of the sea surfaces and the objects in it. In low sea states, water makes an excellent reflector for radio signals, which helps maximize the signal strength as reflections off the water strike the targets in addition to the line-of-sight signal. Additionally, as the sides of ships generally rise vertically from the surface, they form partial corner cubes which increases the returned signal. Offsetting these advantages is the fact that in higher sea states, large waves also create the same signals, making radar clutter a significant problem. A considerable amount of research into clutter reduction was applied to the naval market. See also * ASV Mk.

This accumulation causes various lesions (e.g. polyps, thickened mucosal folds, small areas of redness, and superficial ulcerations) in the mucosal layer lining the GI tract. Individuals with ITCLD-GT commonly complain of chronic GI tract symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. Carbonnell et al. first described a case of an indolent GI tract lymphoproliferation disorder in 1994 and defined the lymphocytes involved in it to be T cells expressing the CD4 glycoprotein on their surface membranes. Subsequent studies reported on patients who had a similar indolent GI tract disorder that involved T cells which expressed either the CD4, CD8, or neither surface membrane glycoprotein. The disorder resembled certain aggressive GI tract lymphomas and was variably termed indolent lymphoma or indolent T cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the disease differed from the aggressive lymphomas which it mimicked in having a prolonged and usually non-progressive course. Furthermore, the disorder's lesions consisted of normal-appearing T cells that proliferated very slowly and usually caused little or no tissue destruction. In 2017, the World Health Organization provisionally classified ITCLD-GT as an extranodal (i.e. usually not involving lymph nodes), indolent disorder in which various subtypes of T cells proliferate in the GI tract. While usually acting like a benign disease, ITCLD-GT has malignant features: 1) its normal-appearing T cells are clonal in nature, i.e. descended from a single cell; 2) these T cells may contain genetic abnormalities that are known to occur in and contribute to the development of very aggressive lymphomas; and 3) ITCLD-GI, after many years of indolent behavior, may progress to an aggressive lymphoma. Thus, ITCLD-GT can act as a premalignat disorder. Nonetheless, most cases of it run an indolent, non-malignant course and when mistakenly treated as an aggressive lymphoma, do not responded to standard chemotherapy treatments. The disorder has also been mistaken for, and found unresponsive to therapies that treat inflammatory or autoimmune bowel diseases. Clinically, ITCLD-GT must be distinguished from the malignant, inflammatory, and autoimmune bowel diseases that it mimics in order to avoid useless and potentially harmful therapies.  Presentation  ITCLD- GT occurs more commonly in males of middle age (median age 48.4, range 15-77 years in one study). Individuals with the disease present with GI tract symptoms which often are serious and/or debilitating and may mimic those occurring in malignant lymphoproliferative, inflammatory, or autoimmune bowel diseases. These symptoms include chronic epigastric pain, abdominal pain, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, relapsing oral ulcers, relapsing colorectal ulcers, rectal bleeding, and/or night sweats. Several patients presenting with these symptoms have been diagnosed with and unsuccessfully treated for peripheral T-cell lymphoma, an inflammatory bowel disease (either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis), or the autoimmune GI tract disorder, celiac disease. It has been shown or appears very likely that these patients had ITCLD-GT rather than the cited diagnoses.  Pathophysiology  The lesions in ITCLD-GT consists of slowly growing, mature, and benign-appearing T cells. The reasons for their accumulations in the GI tract are unclear. However, these cells often carry potentially oncogenic mutations. In a recent study, the T cells in 4 of 5 patients with CD4+ T-cell disease carried a STAT3-JAK2 fusion gene. This gene consists of a fusion between the STAT3 gene at position 2.2 on the long (or \\"g\\") arm of chromosome 17 (location abbreviated 17q21.2) and the JAK2 gene at position 24.1 on the short (\\"q\\") of chromosome 9 (9p24.1). The disorder in two of the patients with this t(9;17)(p24.1;q21/2) fusion gene progressed to malignant lymphomas. Abnormalities in the expression and/or activity of STAT3 and JAK2 as well as various JAK2 fusion genes are associated with the development and progression of various myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative malignancies. These findings suggest that the STAT3-JAK2-fusion gene may contribute to the malignant progression and perhaps development of CD4+ ITCLD-GT. Numerous other genetic abnormalities occur in the T-cells of ITCLD-GT but unlike the STAT3-JAK fusion gene have been limited to single cases. These abnormalities include trisomy of chromosome 5, a t(4;16)(q26;p13) fusion between interleukin-2 and B-cell maturation antigen genes, loses in the 4p26 and 16p13 chromosomal areas involved in formation of the t(4;16)9q26;p13) fusion gene, and one or more copy-number variations in diverse areas of different chromosomes. The role(s), if any, of these abnormalities in ITCLD-GT is unclear.{{citation needed}  T cells In ITCLD-GT  The cells involved in all cases of ITCLD-GT are mature T cells that exhibit a clonal rearrangement of their T cell receptors and, therefore, are derived from a common ancestry cell. They express the Œ±Œ≤ as opposed to the Œ≥Œ¥ surface membrane T-cell receptor and therefore are Œ±Œ≤ rather than Œ≥Œ¥ T-cells. In all reported cases, these T cells express the CD3 cluster of differentiation protein complex but vary in their expression of the CD4 cluster of differentiation glycoprotein as well as the CD8 glycoprotein component of the T cell receptor. Individuals with ITCLD-GT, therefore, have pathological accumulations of either CD4+, CD8+, or, very rarely, CD4-, CD8- T cells. A single case of CD4+, CD8+ T cell disease has been reported recently. There may be differences in the presentation, course, and malignant potential of ITCLD-GT based or these different expressions of CD4 and CD8 but this requires further study. Unlike certain types of T cell lymphomas for which it has been mistaken, the T cells in ITCLD-GT do not express the neutral cell adhesion molecule, CD56, and are not infected with the Epstein-Barr virus and therefore do not express this virus's latency proteins or latency ncRNAs. The origin of these cells is unknown but it is thought that the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells derive from mucosal T helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, respectively. The CD4-, CD8- T cells that may cause rare cases of the disorder exhibit cytology and morphology features of both of the latter two mucosal cell types.  Histology  Histological analysis of tissues biopsied from the GI tract generally reveals dense infiltrates of small, mature lymphocytes in the mucosa that may displace but usually do not invade the epithelium; these cells sometimes extend through the muscularis mucosa to invade the submucosa. The lesions may contain reactive plasma cells, eosinophils, granulomas (in CD4+ disease), and lymphoid follicles. There is little or no tissue destruction. Immunohistochemistry analyses indicate that the small lymphocytes are CD4+, CD8+, CD4-/CD8-,, or CD4+/CD8+ T-cells that stain for CD3 but not CD56 or Epstein-Barr virus products. Notably, the afflicted T cells have an extremely low rate of proliferation as determined by examining their KI-67 protein using immunofluorescence analysis.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of indolent T cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the GI tract depends on identifying the presentation, clinical course, and laboratory and histological findings given in the previous four sections. (Future studies may find that the diagnosis is supported by demonstrating the presence of the STAT3-JAK2 fusion gene in the CD4+ T cells of suspicious tissues.)  Laboratory studies  Inspection of the entire GI tract by endoscopy and colonscopy generally finds mucosal redness, erosions, small superficial ulcerations, occasional small polyps, fissures, diverticula, and, rarely, tumor-like masses and deep ulcers. These lesions may be localized, occur in multiple sites, or extend throughout the GI tract; they are more common in the small intestine and colon but can also occur in the stomach, esophagus, oral cavity (e.g. palate), and rectum. Whole body computed tomography scans (i.e. CT scans) frequently find enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (i.e. lymph nodes attached to the intestinal mesentery) and may show evidence of liver, spleen, and/or other organ involvement in cases which are advancing or have advanced to a malignant lymphoma. Positron emission tomography scans (i.e. PET scans) and positron emission tomography‚Äìcomputed tomography scans (i.e. PET-CT scans) likewise often show that the mesenteric lymph nodes in ITCLD-GT exhibit modestly increased metabolic or biochemical activity and, in cases of progressing or overt malignant disease, show increased activity in other organs. Inspection of patients' peripheral blood smearss and bone marrow tissues may identify excessive numbers of ITCLD-GT's T cells and thereby likewise indicate progressing or malignant disease.  Differential diagnosis  Because of the radical differences in their prognoses and treatments, ITCLD-GT should be distinguished from the malignant, inflammatory, autoimmune, and other diseases that it can mimic. Key findings that distinguish ITCLD-GT from the following major diseases which ITCLD-GT may mimic are: * Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL-NT]: Unlike ITCLD-GT, ENKTCL-NT a) is an Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease that commonly involves midline areas of the nasal cavity, oral cavity, and pharynx but may involve the GI tract; b) is a malignant and aggressive disease when involving the GI tract in areas below pharynx; c) usually involves rapidly proliferating malignant NK rather than T cells; d) commonly causes tissue-destructive lesions that are spread through multiple layers of the GI tract; and e) has lesions consisting of rapidly proliferating lymphocytes which express Epstein-Barr virus products, CD56, and one or more of various specific genetic abnormalities (see Genetic abnormalities in ENKTCL-NT). * Monomorphic epithelieotropic intestinal lymphoma (MEITL) (formerly termed Type II enteropathy-associate T-cell lymphoma): Unlike ITCLD-GT, MEITL a) is a highly aggressive lymphoma of the GI tract that usually takes a short, lethal course; b) has lesions in which rapidly proliferating T cells accumulate in the mucosa and epithelium of the GI tract; and c) involves T cells that are CD4-, CD56-, and MAKT+, often express the Œ≥Œ¥ rather than the Œ±Œ≤ T cell receptor, and in rare cases are infected with, and express products made by, the Epstein-Barr virus. * Peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtype peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS): Unlike ITCLD-GT, PTCL-NOS a) is a heterogenous disease that typically involves peripheral lymph nodes but only rarely develops in the GI tract and b) is characterized by the rapid proliferation of CD4+ T cells that overexpress either GATA3 or TBX21, have a wide range of characteristic genetic abnormalities (see genetic abnormalities in PTCL, NOS), and in ~30% of cases are infected with, and express products made by, the Epstein-Barr virus. * Celiac disease: A high proportion of patients with CD4+ ITCLD-GT and rare cases of CD8+ ITCLD-GT have been misdiagnosed as having celiac disease. Unlike celiac disease, ITCLD-GT: a) is unresponsive to gluten-free diets: b) is negative for antigens detected in standard celiac disease serology blood tests such as anti-transglutaminase antibodies; c) has infiltrating clonal T cells which do not express HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 human leukocyte antigens; and d) have lesions populated by mature, slowly proliferating clonal T cells which are CD56- and either CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, or CD4-/CD8-. However, rare patients have been inflicted with both celiac disease and ITCLD-GT. * Crohn's disease: Crohn's disease has been diagnosed in cases which were later diagnosed as ITCLD-GT perhaps because some patients with ITCLD-GT have histopathologic features (particularly the presence of granulomas)) that are characteristic of Crohn's disease. Awareness of ITCLD-GT and the histologic, clinical, and endoscopic differences between it and Crohn's disease should point to the proper diagnosis. * Ulcerative colitis: Rare wcases of ITCLD-GT appear to have been diagnosed as ulcerative colitis. Awareness of ITCLD-GT and the histologic, clinical, and endoscopic differences between it and ulcerative colitis should point to the proper diagnosis. * Natural killer cell enteropathy (NKCE): NKCE is an indolent disease in which lymphocytes proliferate in the GI tract to cause lesions and symptoms that resemble ITCLD- GT. NKCE differs from ITCLD-GT in that it: a) involves the proliferation of non-clonal NK cell rather than T cell lymphocytes; b) does now show evidence of mesenteric lymph node or other organ involvement; and c) does not progress to a malignant disease.  Treatment  Studies indicate that patients with ITCLD-GT should be treated conservatively. Chemotherapy regimens directed at malignant lymphoma and treatment regimens used to treat celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis have had little or no beneficial effects on the course of the disease. Patients should be follow regularly with peripheral blood and bone marrow examinations, GI tract endoscopic examinations and PET scans in order to detect the progression of ITCLD-GT to a malignant phase.  Prognosis  Studies to date indicate that most patients suffer a prolonged course of persistent or recovering-relapsing GI tract symptoms. A small percentage of patients have had spontaneous and sustained recoveries or progressed to a malignant lymphoma.  Course of the disorder  Most patients with ITCLD-GT have chronic, relapsing and recurring GI tract symptoms that persist over many years. In one retrospective study, 19 of 23 patients with CD4+ ITCLD-GT had persistent disease over a follow-up period of 1-14 years (median 4.8 years), 2 of 23 patients had clinical and morphologic (i.e. negative GI tract evaluations) remissions enduring for at least 5-7 years, and 1 of 23 patients developed and died from a large-cell lymphoma of undetermined type. In the same study, 10 of 10 patients with CD8+ ITCLD-GT had persistent disease that had not progressed to a malignancy over an observation period of 1-18 years (median 2 years) although one patient had developed bone marrow involvement and therefore may have had disease which was in the process of transforming to a malignant state. Other reports have found that the disorder in one patient with CD4-, CD8- ITCLD-GT disease progressed to involve the liver and the disorder in two patients with CD4+ ITCLD-GT disease progressed to an undetermined type of large T-cell lymphoma. In another retrospective analysis, 6 of 34 (17.6%) patients with ITCLD-GT progressed to a malignant state as evidenced by its spread to the blood or bone marrow: 2 (5.6%) patients died as a direct result of this spreading.

It has narrow bracts along the inflorescence stalks on top of which are individual flower heads with an involucre of three whorls of bracts, about sixteen ray florets with about long, pale blue straps, that encircle many yellow disc florets. No fertile seeds have been found, so this species may solely reproduce vegetatively. The species is only known from one location in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg, where it grows on damp stream banks. Description  Felicia wrightii is a perennial plant, herbaceous plant, of up to high. Its leaf rosettes usually develop several, up to about long runners, at the end of which daughter rosettes appear. Most leaves are in a rosette, but smaller ones sit alternately on the stalk. The rosette leaves are elliptic to inverted egg- shaped, up to 4 cm (1 in) long and 1 cm ( in) wide, with an indistinctly pointed tip, and the surface hairless or quickly becoming so, while the leaf margins are cartilaginous and set with tough bristles. The leaves one the peduncles are line-shaped, up to about 1 mm ( in) long and 1 mm (0.06 in) wide. The flower heads sit individually at the end of unbranching stalk, that carry narrow leaves almost to the top, are hairy and are occasionally also glandular. The involucre consists of three whorls of bracts. These bracts are bristly and glandular, becoming less hairy further in. The outer bracts are about long and wide, lance-shaped, the middle bracts about long and wide, and the inner bracts inverted lance-shaped about 6 mm long and 1 mm wide. Each flower head contains about sixteen ray florets, with s pale blue straps of about long and 1 mm (0.06 in) wide. These encircle numerous disc florets with a yellow corolla of up to 3 mm (0.14 in) long. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches are slightly elongated triangular appendages. Around the base of the corolla are numerous, white, clearly toothed and persistent pappus bristles of about 4 mm (0.18 in) long. At the base of the florets sit elliptic, short- haired, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae of about long and wide, with a smooth seed-skin, possibly all of which are sterile. Felicia wrightii is a diploid having nine sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=18).  Taxonomy  South African botanist Olive Mary Hilliard and English botanist Brian Burtt described Felicia wrightii in 1971, based on a specimen collected in 1967, by Wright on the banks of a tributary of the Mooi River, KwaZulu- Natal province of South Africa.  Distribution, habitat and conservation  Felicia wrightii grows in the Kamberg Nature Reserve, that is situated in the Estcourt district of the Drakensberg Mountains in KwaZulu-Natal. It is only known from one site, where it occurs in montane grassland, growing in damp soil on the bank of a stream, at an altitude of approximately . However, its population is stable and appears not to be threatened. This is why it is considered critically rare.

It has opposite leaves and flower heads set individually on up to long stalks, that consist of an involucre of about cm ( in) diameter with two whorls of bracts, about twelve blue ray florets surrounding more yellow disc florets. It is sometimes called kingfisher daisy in English. It can be found in the Northern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental.  Description  Felicia bergeriana is an annual, moderately sturdy, upright herbaceous plant of up to high that branches regularly towards the top. Its stems are covered in perpendicular bristles and glands. The leaves are all oppositely arranged on the stems, lance-, ellipse-, spoon- or inverted lance-shaped, up to 3 cm (1.4 in) long and wide, entire or with some short teeth, without or with an indistinct stalk and covered in long hairs. The flower heads sit individually on top of up to long stalks, that may carry few small alternately set bracts. The involucre is up to cm ( in) in diameter and consists of 2 whorls of bracts. These bracts are all equal in length at about 3 mm (0.14 in) long, the outer lance-shaped, about wide, the inner inverted egg-shaped, about 1 mm wide, with a papery edge, all covered in bristles and glandular hairs. Each flower heads contains about twelve ray florets with a blue strap of about long and 1 mm (0.06 in) wide. These encircle more numerous, yellow disc florets of up to 2 mm (0.1 in) long, those next to the ray florets bisexual and those in the center male. Surrounding the base of the corolla are about ten, quickly discarded, white, protruding bristly pappus bristles of about 1‚Äì2 mm (0.06‚Äì0.10 in) long. The relatively large, eventually yellowish to reddish brown, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are about long and wide, inverted egg-shaped, the surface and the edge of the otherwise hairless marginal ridges are covered with strong, up to 1 mm (0.04 in) long hairs, while the seedskin is covered in scales. The cypselae of the innermost disc florets are hairless.  Taxonomy  The kingfisher daisy was first described by Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel in 1826, based on a specimen that had been collected by Christian Friedrich Ecklon on the Montis Dorsi Leonis (probably Signal Hill, near Cape Town), and he called it Cineraria bergeriana. In 1832, Christian Friedrich Lessing reassigned the species to the genus Elphegea, making the combination Elphegea bergeriana. One year later, followed by Nees von Esenbeck, who called it Detridium bergerianum. In 1836, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle again reassigned it, making the combination Agathaea bergeriana. William Henry Harvey, who merged several genera into Aster, created the name A. bergerianum in 1865. Harry Bolus and Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod in 1950 assign the species to the genus Felicia, creating the combination Felicia bergeriana. J√ºrke Grau in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia (Asteraceae), considered all these names synonymous, but making a spelling error, quoting F. bergerana.  Distribution and conservation  The kingfisher daisy can be found thinly scattered between Namaqualand in the north to the Cape Peninsula in the south. The continued survival of Felicia bergeriana is considered to be of least concern because its population is stable.

It was released on their 1981 album Moving Pictures, and unlike many other Rush songs it was a true studio production, with a variety of percussion instruments and overdubs, and a separate keyboard player. It is the first of four songs in what has been called the band's \\"Fear\\" series, the other three being \\"The Weapon\\" (from Signals, 1982), \\"The Enemy Within\\" (from Grace Under Pressure, 1984), and \\"Freeze\\" (from Vapor Trails, 2002). Content, lyrics, and production The song opens with the sounds of a mob, which Lifeson explained was recorded outside Le Studio on a cold December day, with the band and others shouting, warmed by a bottle of Scotch whisky; they recorded a dozen tracks of this. The lyrics describe how a vigilante mob gathers under torch light, distorting the features of the \\"twisted and grotesque\\" faces: \\"The righteous rise / With burning eyes / Of hatred and ill-will / Madmen fed on fear and lies / To beat and burn and kill\\". The lyrics do not explain what the mob intends to do, but in the second set of stanzas indicate that the mob feeds on xenophobia and religious zealotry: \\"They say there are strangers who threaten us / Our immigrants and infidels / They say there is strangeness too dangerous / In our theaters and bookstore shelves\\". Neil Peart explained later that the song was done as \\"a studio production number\\", as opposed to most other songs, which were done as a three-piece band. It features a broad array of percussive instruments: \\"gong bass drums, wind chimes, glockenspiel, tubular bells, conga, cowbell, vibraslap, various electronic effects\\", according to Peart. Cover designer Hugh Syme contributed synthesizer and in one verse the drums are double-tracked. Music critic Martin Popoff described it as \\"the most reworked and fretted-over song of the album\\". Critical evaluations The \\"foreboding\\" song's lyrics are written by Neil Peart, and they \\"criticize intolerance\\", according to Steven Horwitz, who places the song in the context of the Moral Majority of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when \\"those who know what's best for us\\" were invited to \\"rise and save us from ourselves\\". Max Mobley, writing in 2014, recognized themes from Kurt Vonnegut in the song and remarked that the \\"song seems incredibly relevant today\\", \\"given how intolerant and angry we are today\\". Live performance The song was not played live until three years later, on the tour for Grace Under Pressure. At the end of the 1980s it was dropped from the regular live setlist but returned for the Snakes & Arrows Tour, which started in 2007, where it was a good fit, according to Max Mobley, \\"in mood and message\\". By the time of the Grace Under Pressure tour, the song had acquired an additional lengthy guitar solo at the end, as can be seen on the tour video.

The lower parts of the stems have lost their leaves and the upper part has many crowded, upwardly angled and curved, alternate leaves pressed against the stem, with the edges curled inward. The flower heads form at the tips of the branches, each about 3 cm (1 in) across, with about twenty purplish blue ray florets surrounding many yellow disc florets. It is only known from a small area in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Felicia westae is a low, up to high, sparsely branched shrub. The lower parts of the stem are largely hairless, the higher parts are crowded with arched upturned leaves. The leaves are line- to lance- shaped, long and 1‚Äì1 mm (0.04-0.06 in) wide, the surfaces hairless, and the bristly serrated margins curled upward and towards each other. The flower heads are set individually on short, up to long stalks, which are set with thin white bristles. Surrounding each flower head are three to four whorls of bracts (or phyllaries) that together form the so-called involucre, which is up to in diameter. These bracts are of different length, lance-shaped, about long and approximately 1 mm (0.06 in) wide, with a bristly margin and glands. Each head contains about twenty female ray florets, each with closed, tubular part at the base that is hairy in its upper part and a purplish blue strap of about long and wide. These surround numerous bisexual disc florets with a yellow corolla of about long, hairy in the middle. In the center of each corolla are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. At the tip of both style branches is a narrowly triangular appendage. Surrounding the base of the corolla are many, yellowish white, shallowly serrated, more or less deciduous pappus bristles, all about equal in length at . The eventually yellowish brown to reddish, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are oval in outline, about long and wide, with a weak ridge along the margin. The cypselae of the ray florets are hairless, those of the disc florets short-haired.  Taxonomy  This species of Felicia was first described by Henry Georges Fourcade in 1932, based on a specimen he collected in 1928. He named it Aster westae. J√ºrke Grau in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia (Asteraceae), reassigned the species and made the combination Felicia westae. The species is considered to be part of the section Anhebecarpaea.  Distribution, habitat and conservation  Felicia westae was known from many observations near Humansdorp in the southwest of the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, where it occurred on river banks in low-lying areas near the coast. It grows in vegetation types called Tsitsikamma Sandstone Fynbos and Garden Route Shale Fynbos. It is considered to be endangered because its habitat suffered from expanding agriculture and timber plantations, while on the riverbanks it is out-competed by invasive plant species. After 1944 it was no longer found until it was rediscovered in 2015 along a few tributaries of the Tsitsikamma River.

As an umbrella organization, it currently represents more than 200 member NGOs from 90-plus countries.  History  In May 2009, the World Health Organization convened 70 NGOs from 40 countries in Brussels for the First Global Meeting of NGOs Advocating for Road Safety and Road Victims. The objective was to discuss how NGOs could collaborate to advance the global road safety agenda. The meeting generated what is now known as the ‚ÄúBrussels Declaration,‚Äù which described the concept and outline for a Decade of Action for Road Safety. In September, the WHO asked nine NGOs from the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC) to explore interest from NGOs in a platform that would facilitate information sharing. Exploratory conversations and surveys demonstrated that 89% of surveyed NGOs agreed a platform would be beneficial. In November, the Brussels Declaration was presented at the First Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety in Moscow by NGOs. In March of 2011, the WHO organized the 2nd Global Meeting of NGOs advocating for Road Safety and Victims of road trauma, which was held in Washington, D.C. More than 100 individuals, representing more NGOs from 48 different countries attended the meeting, at which the platform for an alliance of NGOs for road safety was presented. In May of that year, the Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020) was launched by the UN General Assembly. In March of 2012, the WHO formally established a steering committee of representative NGOs to launch the Global Alliance of NGOs for Road Safety, from which an advocacy guide for NGOs was co-produced with the WHO in April. A year later, the Alliance hosted the 3rd Global Meeting of NGOs for Road Safety and Road Victims in Antalya, Turkey. This time, nearly 100 individuals from organizations representing efforts from 50 different countries attended. During the first meeting hosted by the Alliance, the first General Assembly for member NGOs to vote on Alliance bylaws and elect its Board of Directors was held. In September of 2013, the Alliances introduced its 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, outlining its specific goals for membership growth and development. In September of 2014, the Alliance Board of Directors established a permanent Secretariat to serve as liaison to its member NGOs, while it became a member of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration just a month later. Lotte Brondum was made the Executive Director, as the Global Alliance's first employee. Brondum had previously worked with the Danish government as an advisor on HIV/AIDS issues in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Vietnam; with Coca- Cola Sabco implementing an employer's health program, and as the Director of International Development at AIP Foundation. In December, the #SaveKidsLives campaign, guided in part by the Alliance, was launched by the UNRSC to gather signatures for the Child Declaration for Road Safety. In March of 2015, the Alliance hosted its 4th Global Meeting of NGOs advocating for Road Safety and Road Victims in Marrakech, Morocco. Eight months later, the Alliance had coordinated the participation of more than 40 member NGOs at the 2nd Global High-Lebel Conference on Road Safety in Brasilia, Brazil. The Alliance announced its partnership with FedEx to launch the Alliance Empowerment Program for members during the Conference. In February of 2016, the Alliance launched a newly-redesigned website with the aim to improve information sharing among its members and the road safety advocate community. In April, representatives from the Alliance were in attendance for the 22nd meeting of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration taking place at the New York UNICEF headquarters. In June, the Alliance launched a Seed Program Pilot with funding from FedEx, and in August, hosted the 2016 Alliance Advocate training course in Memphis with FedEx. In April of 2017, a 5th Global meeting of NGOs was held in Malaysia, during which the Malaysia Declaration was signed by members and the kickoff event for the 4th UN Global Road Safety Week was held. The month after, members of the Alliance took part in the UN Global Road Safety Week, advocating for improved road safety measures, and reached at least six million people. That August, the second cohort of Alliance Advocates graduated at the FedEx World Headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. In October off 2017, the Alliance launched a new action brief, called ‚ÄúWalking the Talk,‚Äù at the Every Journey, Every Child Conference. In April of 2018, representatives from the Alliance were present at the launch of the UN Road Safety Trust Fund, representing civil society. In 2019, the FedEx Road Safety Awards were created to be awarded to members of the Alliance that exemplify Alliance values and have demonstrated growth and exceptional dedication to road safety. Awards are given for commitment to road safety and/or post-crash response over a period of time, active involvement with the Alliance and having contributed positively to advancing the Alliance mission, and having demonstrated a willingness to learn.  Criticism  In December of 2018, Adnan Hyder MD, PhD, MPH, a distinguished global health leader, published an article in The Lancet Public Health, criticizing the Alliance stating, ‚ÄúThe presence of a global alliance for non-governmental organisations or a victims organisation in a country, though encouraging, is not enough, nor are these organisations sufficiently scaled, to ensure a public movement for safety in the countries that need it most.‚Äù Honors and awards In December of 2017, the Alliance received the Prince Michael International Road Safety Award.

He was executed for murdering a fellow convict, while serving a life sentence for another murder. Crimes Much of Jones' life, including his date of birth, remains a mystery. It is presumed that he was a native to Alabama, and that at one point he served for the 10th Cavalry Regiment. While stationed in Monterey, California, he allegedly shot and killed one of his victims, a deputy sheriff named W. S. Moseley. Jones was given life imprisonment for a murder. He then proceeded to murder a fellow convict, most likely Cleave Waters, for which he was given the death penalty. On the day of his execution, he left a note in his cell, confessing to 13 murders and naming his victims as follows: Dated murders * 1907 - unnamed convict at Banner mines, Alabama * 1911 - unnamed convict at Banner mines, Alabama * May 22, 1911 - Cleave Waters, convict at Banner mines, Alabama Undated murders * Thomas Thompson - Crawford, Nebraska * Charles Bennett - Crawford, Nebraska * W. S. Moseley - deputy sheriff at Crawford, Nebraska * Shay White - Monterey, California * Thomas Shay - Monterey, California * Sam Lee - Chinese man at Monterey, California * Unknown - Unidentified brakeman for Mobile & Ohio Railroad at Boydwell, Kentucky * Bessie Humphrey - Huntsville, Alabama * Pattie Quiergo - Mexican woman at Fort Wingate, New Mexico * John Little John - Native American at Sheridan, Wyoming Jones also confessed to a failed murder attempt against a man named Richard Moore, putting the date as September 12, 1912. He expressed regret at this failure, as he apparently wanted to even out his kill count. Syd Jones was one of three convicts hanged on June 25, 1915 in Alabama, the other two being: * Lon Carter, hanged at Birmingham for murdering his wife * Tim Sharpe, hanged at Anniston for murdering two policemen Corroboration of claims After his execution, authorities from the Crawford Police Department contacted The Alliance Herald in order to clarify the circumstances for the Nebraska murders. While a trio of men was truly killed during a riot in the 10th Cavalry, they also noted that the official's name was not W. S. Moseley, but instead Art Moss. They further explained the events as follows - at the time, the 10th Cavalry had been stationed at Fort Robinson. Some of the troopers held a grudge against the Moss brothers, as they had won a race. A few weeks after winning said race, the Marshal of Crawford was called for some business out of town, and thus selected Art Moss to serve during his absence. On a Sunday evening, several of the soldiers got drunk near the river embankments, before returning to the town and causing a disturbance. The police were called, with Moss arriving and trying to calm down the situation. At that moment, the soldiers opened fire and killed Moss, immediately fleeing afterwards. A crowd of citizens chased after them, killing one of the fugitives near a reservation and capturing another, who was hiding in a barn loft, before dragging him to the jail. In the meantime, the rest of the soldiers had gotten firearms, with the intention of shooting up the town. Due to fears of a lynching, a guard was sent down from Fort Robinson to protect the jail, and when the soldiers arrived, they surrounded the residence. While they were on duty, a man named Phil Murphy came running along and turned towards an alley leading to the jail, which was guarded by the troopers. Unaware of their presence, they told him to halt, but Murphy became frightened and instead continued running. The soldiers, believing he was making a run for the jail, opened fire and killed him. When the following morning came and the situation had calmed down, the captured soldier was tried, found guilty and sent off to a penitentiary. The authorities from the department suggested that Jones was among the crowd of troopers who killed Moss, as a man with that name was found to have connections to the 10th Cavalry.

It is hosted and edited by the University of Rochester. History Futurity was established in 2009 by a group of thirty-five research universities, including Stanford University. The site's co-founders were Lisa Lapin, Michael Schoenfeld, and Bill Murphy, who were then affiliated with Stanford University, Duke University, and the University of Rochester, respectively. A beta version of the site was launched in March 2009, with the site officially launching on September 15 of that year. The site's founding was born out of the increasing difficulty faced by universities in publicizing their research through traditional news outlets. Murphy explained that the site would be distinct from science-oriented wire services like Eurekalert! in that its target audience would be the general public, rather than professional journalists. Founding editor Jenny Leonard, also of the University of Rochester, noted that the site is not strictly a journalism website, telling the Columbia Journalism Reviews Curtis Brainard, \\"It wasn‚Äôt meant to be a replacement for the type of reporting and analysis which is so essential to covering science and research completely.\\" By 2011, the site had set up deals with the news aggregators Flipboard and LinkedIn Pulse to share Futurity's content on their platforms. Membership Membership in Futurity was originally limited to the sixty-two members of the Association of American Universities. Member schools were also initially charged a $2,000 membership fee. Within two years, Futurity had nearly doubled its university membership from thirty-five to sixty. The site now also accepts members from the Russell Group, the Group of Eight, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. Content Futurity's articles are based on press releases and other stories submitted to the site by the universities themselves. The articles are often written by the universities' public relations departments, and they are only lightly edited to increase their appeal to the general public before publication. Reactions Earle Holland, the assistant vice president for research communications at Ohio State University, criticized Futurity in an article for the Winter 2009/2010 issue of ScienceWriters magazine. His specific criticisms of the site included that \\"The Futurity staff was allowed to alter the content of the research stories institutions submitted, based on their own discretion\\", and that \\"No one on the Futurity staff was an experienced science writer\\". Science journalist Charlie Petit told the San Jose Mercury News that although university press releases are a reliable source on which to base science stories, as Futurity does, they \\"...are completely absent any skepticism or investigative side.\\" In an article published in Seed, Evan Lerner accused Futurity of \\"...blur[ring] the line between reporting and public relations\\". He also argued that \\"Futurity‚Äôs emphasis on presentation and social networking might help get science information in front of new sets of eyes, but it‚Äôs unlikely to bridge the gulf between experts and the scientifically illiterate.\\" References External links * Category:News aggregators Category:Internet properties established in 2009 Category:American science websites Category:2009 establishments in the United States Category:Press release agencies Category:Non-profit organizations based in New York (state) ","title":"Futurity (website)"},{"id":"60134896","text":"William Henry Curry is an American conductor and composer.

Her scientific interest and main area of work relates to the interaction of neurons and immune cells in the brain. She has studied the cellular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and is the co-author of the first articles about cell death in relation to phagocytosis.  Education  Neni≈°kytƒó completed her bachelor's degree in biochemistry at the Vilnius University in June, 2006. During her bachelor's program she did an internship at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany. She carried out her bachelor thesis work on \\"Investigation of retrograde transport of heat shock protein Hsp47\\" at the Cell Biology and Biophysics Unit of the EMBL. Neni≈°kytƒó continued with her education at the Vilnius University and was awarded with a Master of Biochemistry in 2008. Her master thesis work on \\"Application of microRNAs for fluorescent microscopy-based functional analysis\\" was done at the BioQuant institute (Center for Quantitative Analysis of Molecular and Cellular Biosystems) at Heidelberg University, Germany. She completed her PhD program in biochemistry at the St John's College of the University of Cambridge, UK in July, 2012. Her doctoral thesis subject was \\"Amyloid Œ≤ and microglial phagocytosis\\". The thesis objective was to determine the role of microglial phagocytic function in neuronal loss induced by Alzheimer‚Äòs disease peptide AŒ≤. By virtue of knock-out animal cell cultures and pharmacological manipulations she demonstrated that neuronal loss induced by subneurotoxic concentrations of AŒ≤ was mediated by microglial phagocytosis.  Career  In February 2012 Neni≈°kytƒó gained a research associate position at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of Cambridge. She participated in a collaborative project with Professor Peter St George-Hyslop on the risk genes of late-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and how they modulate microglial activation. Following that, she was a short- term fellow at the Neuroscience Institute of LSMU, Kaunas. In November 2012 Neni≈°kytƒó begun to work as a scientific consultant at UAB Expertus Vilnensis. She contributed to the development of automated anatomical pathology in Lithuania. From 2013 to 2016 Neni≈°kytƒó was a trainee at the EMBL under the post-doctoral Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie programme. She investigated the role of synaptic pruning during development, in order to identify candidate molecular tags that mediate discrimination between weak and strong synapses during circuit maturation. Neni≈°kytƒó currently works as Marie Sklodowska Curie Experienced Researcher at the Department of Neurobiology and Biophysics of Life Science Center at the Vilnius University. Her group aims to define molecular signalling pathways that drive developmental pruning of unnecessary synapses, during which immune brain cells remove unnecessary connections from the developing neuron network, creating the conditions for the formation of a structurally and functionally developed network.

Early life L.C. Ringhaver was born in Cleveland, Ohio and attended Cleveland schools. Not much more is known about his life in Ohio other than that he met and married his wife Elaine Smith in that state before moving down to Florida in 1947.  Career  L.C. Ringhaver left Cleveland, Ohio for St. Augustine in 1947 at the age of 36. He was employed by Diesel Engine Sales Co. (DESCO) to boost production of shrimp boats. For transforming the shipyard into a success, President John F. Kennedy awarded Ringhaver the \\"E Award\\" for excellence and he was made general manager of the company. He began to power shrimp boats with Caterpillar engines, and in 1957, Ringhaver became the sole owner of DESCO. He was named an official engine dealer for Caterpillar and then in 1961 founded the Ring Power Corporation in St. Augustine, Florida. Throughout the 1960s Ringhaver was a director of the Atlantic National Bank, the St. Augustine National Bank, the Florida Forestry Association, the Florida Waterways Association, the Seafarer Magazine, Florida Ports and Trade Council, the Florida State Chamber of Commerce, and the Gator Bowl Association. When Ringhaver died in 1976, his oldest son Lance became the president of Ring Power. In 1986, younger son Randy Ringhaver took over as president and is the current president and CEO of Ring Power. Lance had moved to Tampa and formed the Ringhaver Equipment Company, the Caterpillar dealer for Central Florida. In 2004 Ringhaver Equipment Company and Ring Power Corporation merged. Ring Power today has twenty-six sales locations.  Family life and legacy  Oliveros House plaque L. C. Ringhaver married Elaine Smith while still living in Ohio. He and Elaine had two sons together, Lance and Randy, who both followed their father into his business. After Ringhaver died, Elaine remarried to Brigadier General Charles Riggle and became Elaine Ringhaver Riggle. Randy Ringhaver, her son and executive committee member of the Board of Trustees at Flagler College, created the Elaine Ringhaver Riggle Women's Golf Scholarship at the college in her honor. The Ringhaver Student Center at Flagler College is named after L.C. Ringhaver. Ringhaver served on Flagler's Board of Trustees from 1969‚Äì1976. Ring Power also established the L.C. Ringhaver Scholarship in his name once he had passed away. Ringhaver is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in St. Augustine. L.C. Ringhaver was a member of the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission (which later became the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board) from 1965‚Äì1969. He donated the money to restore the Oliveros House in 1965 and leased the house to the Commission for the sum of $1 per year. There is a plaque outside the house honoring his philanthropy. The property was in turn sub-leased to Jose R. Casallas who opened a cigar factory and retail store on the premises. Ringhaver Park in Jacksonville, Florida is also named for Ringhaver. His family made memorial donations for the park's initial development. Ringhaver had served as a trustee of Jacksonville University and as president of the Greater Jacksonville Open for two terms. The park has expanded to 576 acres. Ringhaver's oldest son Lance passed away following an automobile accident in 2016 at the age of 76.

He was Timur's favourite son and served as one of his military commanders as well as his heir apparent. However, Jahangir died in 1376, predeceasing his father by almost thirty years. Birth Jahangir was one of four sons of Timur who survived infancy and the only one born of a free wife. His mother Turmish Agha also gave birth to two other children; Jahanshah, who died young and a daughter, Aka Biki, who was the mother of Sultan Husayn Tayichiud. There is some disagreement regarding whether Jahangir or his brother Umar Shaikh was the eldest of Timur's sons. The Mu‚Äôizz al-Ansab (The Glorifier of Genealogies), the most important source regarding the structure of the Timurid royal family during this period, is contradictory on this point. It states that Jahangir was the eldest, but the family of Umar Shaikh is presented first in the genealogy itself, implying that the latter was born first. Narrative sources, such as the Zafarnama by Nizam-ud-din Shami, and Yazdi's book of the same name support the notion that Jahangir was younger. War with Moghulistan Following the death of Tughlugh Timur, the Khan of the Chagatai Khanate, control of the eastern half of his territory (an area termed Moghulistan) was seized by a noble named Qamar-ud-din Dughlat. Taking advantage of the disorder, Timur, who had already conquered the western half of the khanate, led an expedition against Dughlat in 1370. By 1375, Dughlat was in continual retreat from Timur and had sheltered in the K√∂k-tepe Mountains. Jahangir was sent to pursue the noble through the narrow gorges between the peaks, defeating various Mongol detachments in the region along the way. Though Dughlat himself eluded capture, Jahangir was able to capture his wife, Tuman Agha, and daughter, Dilshad Agha. The latter of the two was married to Timur soon after. Marriage In 1372, Timur launched an invasion of the former Chagatai territory of Khorasan, then under the control of the Sufi dynasty. Though initially defiant, the ruler of the kingdom, Yusuf Sufi, eventually submitted and offered his niece Khanzada Begum in marriage to Jahangir. Khanzada was the daughter of Yusuf's brother Aq Sufi by Shakar Beg, a daughter of Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde. The following year, Khanzada was sent to Timur's capital of Samarqand with a large procession carrying gifts, including gems, precious metals, silks and tapestries. She was escorted by a retinue of handmaidens and mounted soldiers, while she herself rode veiled on a white camel. Jahangir had a son and a daughter by this marriage, Muhammad Sultan Mirza and Yadigar Sultan. Death The Tomb of Jahangir in Shakhrisabz, Uzbekistan Jahangir died of illness only two years after his marriage in 1376. Timur was reportedly inconsolable by his son's death, which caused a hiatus in his otherwise continuous military campaigns. Yazdi states that \\"Everything then became melancholy and disagreeable to him and his cheeks were almost always bathed in tears; he clothed himself with mourning, and his life became uneasy to him. The whole kingdom, which used to be overjoyed at the arrival of this great emperor, was turned into a place of sorrow and weeping.\\" He was buried in a tall edifice termed the \\"Tomb of Jahangir\\", part of the Dorussaodat mausoleum complex in modern-day Shahrisabz. Presently, the tomb is the best surviving part of the structure. Family Jahangir had six children by three wives: By Khanzada Begum, daughter of Aq Sufi Qongirat *Muhammad Sultan Mirza *Yadigar Sultan By Ruqayya Khanike, daughter of Amir Kai-Khusrau Apardi *Jahan Sultan By Bakht Malik Agha, daughter of Ilyas Khwaja Tatar Yasauri *Pir Muhammad Mirza *Fatima Sultan *Payanda Sultan  References  Category:Timurid dynasty Category:1356 births Category:1376 deaths ","title":"Jahangir Mirza (Timurid prince)"},{"id":"60135674","text":"The Valley Eagle was a named streamliner passenger train of the Missouri Pacific Railroad that began in 1948.

A descendant of early Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam, he proved to be a man of both questionable ethics and allegiances. He somehow was able to retain his family fortune despite being an active Loyalist and working in the British Army's Quartermaster Corps for most of the war, keeping the accounts of various quartermasters. Later, as an investigator of war profiteering among quartermasters he received a lifetime pension and other gifts from those whom he cleared, apparently by manipulating evidence. Biography When Sir William Erskine, Quartermaster General, returned to England in 1779 to face an audit and investigation for war profiteering, he asked Dyckman to accompany him. Bribed off by Erskine with a life annuity, he remained in England ten years, profiting upon other investigations of quartermasters and only returned to the newly independent United States in 1789. While in London he associated with many wealthy members of society and acquired their tastes, particularly for the neoclassical buildings of Robert Adam. He bought many furnishings and decorative objects, such as a Wedgwood dinner service, and had them shipped back to the United States with him. With the interest on a sizable life annuity granted him by Sir William Erskine for clearing the Baronet, Dyckman intended to build an estate on 250 acres (1 km¬≤) near Montrose and named it Boscobel, perhaps after Boscobel House in Shropshire (itself named for the Italianate bosco bello, \\"pretty woodland\\"), symbolizing his Anglophilia. According to one biographer, he saw himself as a \\"conspicuously well-fixed farmer, surrounded with objects of taste...who did not farm too seriously\\". He began this process by marrying Elizabeth Corne, daughter of another Loyalist family, in 1794. But within a year he faced financial difficulties; the halt of Erskine's annuity by his heirs after his death and his own lavish tastes and generous gifts to less fortunate family members contributing to reduce his circumstances. Dyckman returned to London in 1799, expecting to mend his fortunes and return to his wife, son and daughter within a year. Instead he remained three years, finishing the remaining quartermasters' investigation under John Dalrymple, himself once one of the inquiry's targets. He restored his fortunes by persuading the Erskines to restore their annuity and negotiating an extremely generous settlement with Dalrymple and the other quartermasters whom he had helped clear, apparently by manipulating evidence. Wealthier but injured and ailing, Dyckman returned to the United States in 1803 and set about building the house he had long planned, Boscobel. It is possible that he had blueprints drawn up in England, since work began within six months of his return. The architect is not known, although surviving records show that a William Vermilye was heavily involved as construction manager. Dyckman died in 1806, before it was finished. His widow completed it, and she and their surviving son moved into it in 1808. In the mid-20th century it faced demolition, but was saved as a historic site. Relocated from Cortlandt to Garrison, New York, it is a popular tourist destination on the Hudson River.

Sensors are registered with the kernel through \`sysmon_envsys(9)\` API. Consumption and monitoring of sensors from the userland is performed with the help of \`envstat\` utility through \`proplib(3)\` through \`ioctl(2)\` against the \`/dev/sysmon\` pseudo-device file, the \`powerd\` power management daemon that responds to kernel events by running scripts from \`/etc/powerd/scripts/\`, as well as third-party tools like \`symon\` and GKrellM from pkgsrc.  Features  The framework allows the user to amend the monitoring limits specified by the driver, and for the driver to perform monitoring of the sensors in kernel space, or even to programme a hardware chip to do the monitoring for the system automatically. Two levels of limits are defined: critical and warning, both of which additionally extend to an over and an under categorisation. If limit thresholds are crossed, a kernel event may be generated, which can be caught in the userland by \`powerd\` to execute a pre-defined user script. By comparison, in OpenBSD's hw.sensors, the monitoring of user-defined values is performed in userspace by \`sensorsd\`. , the framework itself does not facilitate computer fan control, although the drivers could still implement interfacing with the fan-controlling capabilities of their chips through other means, for example, through a driver-specific sysctl interface, which is the approach taken by the \`dbcool(4)\` driver. However, the drivers for the most popular Super I/O chips like \`lm(4)\` and \`itesio(4)\` do not implement any fan control at all (in fact, historically, in all of OpenBSD, NetBSD and DragonFly, these drivers don't even report the duty cycle of the fans ‚Äî only the actual RPM values are reported).  History  The framework undergone two major revisions: the first version of \`envsys.h\` was committed on ; with \`envsys.4\` man page following on . Between 2000 and 2007, the manual page for envsys(4) in NetBSD stated that the \\"API is experimental\\", and that the \\"entire API should be replaced by a sysctl(8)\\", \\"should one be developed\\"; it can be noted that in 2003 this was the exact approach taken by OpenBSD with sysctl hw.sensors when some of the envsys(4) drivers were ported to OpenBSD. The second revision came about on . The serialisation with userland was reimplemented using property lists with the help of NetBSD's new proplib(3) library (the underlying transport layer between the kernel and userland still being done through ioctl). The envsys framework was the precursor to OpenBSD's sysctl hw.sensors framework in 2003, and many drivers, as well as some sensor types, have been ported back and forth between NetBSD and OpenBSD. Support for sensors of \`drive\` type has been added to NetBSD on , similar to \`drive\` type in OpenBSD, which was at the same time when bio(4) and bioctl were ported from OpenBSD to NetBSD.

It was published weekly in the Spanish magazine El Jueves, starting from number 772. After 1243 consecutive weeks of circulation, the series ended in 2015 in Spain. It had stopped the year before in Argentina (September 2014), where it was simultaneously published in a young persons supplement called No in the newspaper P√°gina/12. Over 1,000 episodes of the comic strip were also published in the Italian magazine Skorpio. French, German, Greek and Croatian translations were also made. The series has been compiled periodically into albums, and is considered one of the most important works of the three creators. The central character is the prostitute Clara, and the cartoon reflects her amusing adventures and misadventures as a sex worker, along with the peculiar characters that get involved with her and her son Pablito. Description Clara de noche was a humorous series of erotic cartoons. Initially it was produced in black and white but later in colour, and covered two pages. It recounts the adventures of an innocent prostitute, called Clara Fernandez, and her relationship with clients. Other characters include her very clever son Pablito and her friend Virtudes. Clara's physical appearance is clearly inspired by the famous American bondage model and pin- up, Bettie Page. Controversy Clara become one of the most well-known and loved characters of El Jueves, with a large following of fans who see in her the idealisation of a woman; a libertine, independent and attractive. Despite this success in both in the Spanish and Argentine press, the comic had been the target of strong criticism and denunciations for alleged sexist and degrading content. However, over the years, the comic's appeal was strengthened and popularised within both the mainstream and also pop culture in these countries.

She is credited with coining the term \\"slut-bashing\\" in her 1999 book Slut!: Growing Up Female With a Bad Reputation; the concept has since been mostly known as \\"slut-shaming.\\"  Career  Tanenbaum came to public attention with the publication of her 1999 book Slut!: Growing Up Female With a Bad Reputation. In it, she addresses the use of the word \\"slut\\" as a \\"perjorative, gender-specific noun\\" usually applied only to women, while words for promiscuous men (e.g. \\"Casanova\\", \\"ladies man\\", etc.) are generally more approving. The book relates the effect that this double-standard has on girls and women, from the 1950s through the 1990s. In writing it, Tanenbaum drew on her own experiences as a teenager, as well as on interviews with 50 girls and women who had all been labeled as \\"sluts\\" in their communities. She found that most of them were not sexually active, but that that such name-calling was commonly used as a form of bullying. She reports on 1993 poll that found that 42 percent of girls \\"have had sexual rumors spread about them\\" and said that school systems need to do more to combat this form of harassment. In the book, she coined the phrase \\"slut-bashing,\\" which she used to describe a \\"specific form of student-to- student verbal sexual harassment in which a... girl is bullied because of her perceived or actual sexual behavior.\\" In 2002, Tanenbaum turned to the topic of competition and aggression between women in her book Catfight: Rivalries Among Women: From Diets to Dating, From the Boardroom to the Delivery Room. The book draws on academic research, journalistic reporting, fieldwork, and personal experience. It argues that competition between women arises from and perpetuates gender inequality, and that \\"competing with other women for limited resources and advantages is one of women's few viable options.\\" Reviewer Andi Zeisler noted that the book was one of several on relational aggression between women that came out the same year, citing also Rachel Simmons' Odd Girl Out, Phyllis Chesler's Woman's Inhumanity to Woman and Emily White's Fast Girls. Tanenbaum returned to the topic of slut-shaming with her 2015 book I Am Not a Slut: Slut-Shaming in the Age of the Internet. As with Slut!, the book is based on interviews; Tanenbaum's sample for I Am Not a Slut were 55 girls and women, aged 14 to 22 who either had used the word \\"slut\\" against others, or who had been the targets of the word. In the book, she describes the tension women and girls experience so as not to be either a \\"prude\\" or a \\"slut\\", neither too sexual nor insufficiently sexual. Some women see reclaiming the word \\"slut\\" as a way of owning their own sexuality, but Tanenbaum argues that the word \\"slut\\" is \\"too dangerous to be reclaimed,\\" and fears that ‚Äúmass reclamation will trigger a terrible backlash against women.‚Äù In her 2009 book Taking Back God: American Women Rising Up for Religious Equality, Tanenbaum writes about women \\"who are deeply committed to their traditions yet unhappy with limitations placed on women within them,\\" based on interviews with 95 women from five major faith traditions. She identifies four goals shared by a majority of her respondents: for women to have leadership roles in their faith communities, for the language of the liturgy to reflect women's presence, for recognition that women's bodies are \\"normal and not aberrant\\", and for women to be recognized as created in the image of God. In 2019, Tanenbaum launched an Instagram project, @BeingDressCoded, that explores the intersection of slut-shaming and dress codes. She has said that she wanted to ‚Äúcreate a space in which we don‚Äôt just observe individual stories about dress codes but can look for patterns and learn from a larger, collective story about sexism and sexual objectification.‚Äù Tanenbaum is the editorial director in Communications at Barnard College, and has previously worked in communications for Planned Parenthood. She is also a member of the Pembroke Center Associates Council, the governing body for the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University. She has been a contributing writer for the Huffington Post.  Personal life  Tanenbaum has described herself as \\"committed to observant Judaism.\\" Although she attends an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, she does not identify as an Orthodox Jew \\"because Orthodoxy withholds equality from women and gays and lesbians.\\" She has two sons.

Early life  He was born and raised in a Punjabi Hindu family in Peshawar, British India; and married to Swarna Jaggi. He worked at a small eatery called Moti Mahal, owned by a man named Mokha Singh Lamba. In 1947, during the partition of India, he fled from Peshawar to Delhi with his family as a refugee trying his luck.  Expanded Description  However, 1947 brought the tragedy of partition, forcing among others, Kundan Lal Jaggi flee to India. Uncertainty faced him, as he had neither the money nor the resources to start afresh in life. He dropped off at Delhi to try his luck. Roaming the streets, he chanced upon an abandoned Thara in Daryaganj, which was considered a then newer part of Old Delhi. Some inner voice told him that this was the spot, which would not only rehabilitate him but also, who knows, the Delhi wallas would see merit in his Tandoori chicken. After curating 94 years of his life amongst the walls of milestones and inventing deliciousness for this world, the great man ‚Äì Kundan Lal Jaggi, bid farewell to all of us in March, 2018. Daryaganj : Restaurateur He met two of his old colleagues from the restaurant, at a Liquor store in Delhi. They talked & then decided to revive Moti Mahal in Delhi. Kundan Lal Jaggi and partners recruited some more people, they knew from Peshawar & soon, the Moti Mahal Restaurant actively swayed the town. The journey of Kundan Lal Jaggi & his partners was a series of happy coincidences. 'Luck by chance' could be the tagline for some of their biggest gastronomic inventions. \\"Dilli mein Restaurant ka koi riwaaz nahi tha\\" (Translation: There was no culture of eating out in Delhi), said Kundan Lal Jaggi, during an interview.

Work Dunn's research focuses on information based logics, particularly relevance logics and other so-called \\"substructural\\" logics. He has an algebraic approach to these under the heading of \\"gaggle theory\\" (for generalized galois logics), which he has developed in articles, his book with G. Hardgree Algebraic Methods in Philosophical Logic (Oxford, 2001) , and a book with K. Bimb√≥, Generalized Galois Logics: Relational Semantics of Nonclassical Logical Calculi. (CSLI Publications, 2008). In his work on relevance logic, he was fortunate to study as a graduate student with the two major figures in relevance logic, Alan Ross Anderson and Nuel D. Belnap, Jr. He was a contributing author to their book Entailment: The Logic of Relevance and Entailment Vol. 1, and a full co-author with them to Vol. 2. He has also worked on quantum logic and quantum computation, subjective probability in the context of incomplete and conflicting information, and with Katalin Bimbœå recently proved the decidability of Ticket Entailment (a problem open since 1960).

Biography  He graduated with a degree in business administration, specializing in taxation and tax consultancy, and he also worked at the National Institute of Social Security in the Spanish Ministry of Social Affairs. His political career began when he was appointed Councillor by the Partido Popular on April 21, 1997, succeeding Juan Manuel Moreno Bonilla who went on to serve as Deputy to the Regional Government of Andalusia. In the 1999 municipal elections, Carpena ranked number 15 in the list led by Celia Villalobos. His position as Councilman for the Partido Popular was reconfirmed as they obtained an absolute majority with 19 councillors.  Murder  He was killed at 9:40 p.m. on Saturday July 15, 2000 outside his home while travelling by official car to go to a local speech called the Proclamation of the Biznaga. Carpena was accompanied by his wife and his 17-year-old daughter, who were present during the murder. While the family was getting into the official car, the terrorist Igor Solana Matarran, who had been waiting for more than one hour for their departure, shot at him six times. Four bullets hit the politician and one struck him in the neck, fatally wounding him. Once the murder was committed, the killer escaped in another vehicle where another ETA member, Harriet Iragi Gurrutxaga, was waiting for him. Mart√≠n Carpena never received threats, which is why he did not have bodyguards with him. The next day his body was laid in state in Malaga's City Hall, and the citizens carried out a protest against violence and terrorism. After lying in state, a funeral was held in the Cathedral of Malaga, which was attended by numerous politicians, including Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, Manuel Chaves, Ana Botella, Jaime Mayor Oreja, Jes√∫s Posada, Javier Arenas and Mayor Francisco de la Torre.  Arrest of the murderers  Igor Solana and Harriet Iragi were arrested in Seville three months later after murdering Colonel Antonio Mu√±oz Cari√±anos. In 2001, they were sentenced to 30 years in prison.  Recognition  The day after his murder, he was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of the city. In September of the same year, it was decided to change the name of the Malaga City Sports Arena to the Martin Carpena Sports Arena, which it remains today. His hometown held a tribute in his honour 10 years after his death in 2010. There is also a bust in his memory in the Park of Huelin.

Location The road starts at the township of Rironi, in Kiambu County, about , northwest of the central business district of Nairobi. The road runs in a general north-easterly direction, through Naivasha and Nakuru, in Nakuru County, to end at Mau Summit, approximately away. The project also involves the resurfacing of the Rironi‚ÄìMai Mahiu‚ÄìNaivasha Road, also referred to as the Escarpment Road. This road measures approximately , in length. This brings the total project mileage to about . Overview This road is part of the Northern Corridor, that is used in the transportation of goods and passengers from the port city of Mombasa and the capital city of Nairobi, to Kenya's western counties and the land-locked countries of Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi and the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Nairobi‚ÄìNakuru‚ÄìMau Summit Highway, has also been identified by the National Transportation and Safety Authority of Kenya (NTSA), to contain the two most accident-prone stretches of road in Kenya. These are (a) the highway between Nairobi and Nakuru and (b) the section of road Sobea‚ÄìSalgaa‚ÄìMau Summit, on the road between Nakuru and Eldoret, known as the Salgaa stretch. Upgrading to dual carriageway In order to alleviate the perpetual traffic jams and the slow travel times along this stretch of highway, the government of Kenya, through the Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), decided in 2017 to expand the highway from two lanes to four lanes, with toll stations, under a public-private-partnership arrangement. Of the ten firms that expressed initial interest, only two consortia submitted written bids. The two are (a) The consortium comprising Aiim, Egis, Mota-Engil and Orascom and (b) The Rift Valley Connect Consortium comprising Vinci Highways SAS, Meridian Infrastructure Africa Fund, and Vinci Concessions SAS. One of these consortia was awarded the contract to design, finance, build, operate, maintain the four-lane toll-highway for 30 years after commissioning, and then transfer it to the government of Kenya. The budgeted construction cost was KSh180 billion (US$1.8 billion). In October 2020, the government of Kenya, represented by Kenya's Ministry of Transport, Infrastructure, Housing, Urban Development & Public Works, through KeNHA, and The Rift Valley Connect Consortium comprising Vinci Highways SAS, Meridian Infrastructure Africa Fund, and Vinci Concessions SAS, signed a ‚Ç¨1.3 billion (KES:163.8 million) contract to (a) upgrade the existing Nairobi‚ÄìMau Summit Road to a dual four-lane highway (b) upgrade and widen the Rironi‚ÄìMai Mahiu‚ÄìNaivasha Road to become a seven-metre carriageway with shoulders on both sides (c) construction of a elevated highway through Nakuru town and (d) construct and improve the of interchanges along this highway. The consortium will own, design, fund, construct, operate and maintain the toll-highway for 30 years after commercial commissioning, after which ownership will revert to the Kenyan government. Construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2021 and last at least 42 months.

A reef break is an area in the ocean where waves start to break once they reach the shallows of a reef. Lance's Right is known as one of the most perfect waves, and the crown jewel of the Mentawai Isles.  Origin of the name  It is known as a right, which means the wave breaks from right to left from the perspective of a watcher on shore. The location is named after the first person to find this wave, Lance Knight. Lance Knight came to the Mentawai Islands in 1991 in search of new waves, and eventually paid a local man in a canoe to take him upon the wave now known as Lance's Right. A group of surfers on the boat Indies Trader found Lance 2 weeks later, and the captain, Martin Daly, named the spot Lance's Right in honor of the first person to surf it. The other name, HTs, is an abbreviation for Hollow Trees, because of a hollow tree that was on the beach, but is no longer there.  Specifics of the break  The break at Lance's Right is a \\"deceivingly\\" shallow reef, with an inside section known as the \\"surgeon's table\\", for the common injuries that happen to surfers who get stuck and cut on the flat section of the reef. The end section is known as The Cage, where many photographers sit in boats and take photos of the surfers.  Competitions  In April 2016, the Rip Curl Mentawai Pro was held as a World Surf League (WSL) and Asian Surfing Championship (ASC) event at Lance's Right. Australian Chris Zaffis won the title, beating Indonesian surfer Dede Suryana in the final round.

Origins The Casamonica clan originates from the Casamonica and Di Silvio families, families of sedentary Sintis originating from Abruzzo and Molise, who came from Pescara and Venafro to the capital in the seventies. The group is therefore made up of the members of these families, with occasional relations with other Sinti families such as the Barovero (Piedmont), the Cena (Turin), the De Rosa, the Di Guglielmo, the Di Rocco, the Ciarelli, the Di Lauro, the Zini, the Spada and the Spinelli; they also rely on the Seferovic of Bosnian origin. Areas of activity The traditional cornerstones of the mafia clan are the areas located in the south-eastern outskirts of the capital: Romanina, Anagnina, Porta Furba, Tuscolano, Spinaceto and further down, towards the south, in other municipalities up to Frascati and Monte Compatri. According to the Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate (DIA), it is the most powerful and rooted criminal structure in Lazio, with an estimated assets of 90 million euros. According to a census by Vittorio Rizzi, head of the Rome mobile team, the clan is made up of a thousand affiliates.

Biography James Hilleary was a native Washingtonian. In 1942, Hilleary graduated from Gonzaga High School in Washington, D.C., after which he was immediately drafted into the Army. After his military service, he enrolled at Catholic University. Hilleary had a passion for music and art throughout his life, having spent countless hours at the Phillips Collection while his father, who was also a musician and artist, studied art there under C. Law Watkins. Accordingly, Hilleary double-majored in music and architecture, graduating in 1950 with a Bachelor's degree in architecture.The Georgetowner: \\"James Hilleary at Susan Conway Gallery\\" by Georgia Shallcross (April 10, 1997) After graduation, Hilleary went into the private practice of architecture and remained a principal at his own firm until joining Rysson Maryland Corporation in 1976. Hilleary served on the executive committee of the Potomac Valley Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, wrote extensively for local and national publications, and was the recipient of several local and national awards for design excellence. Though Hilleary had started a career as an architect, painting had been his passion since childhood. Therefore, Hilleary began creating the paintings like those that he loved but could never afford. He was married to Margaret Keirn, the daughter of Brig. Gen. Donald J. Keirn, and had children Cecily, Leslie, Sidonie, and Keirn. Critical recognition Hilleary was associated with the Washington Color School.Washington Times Magazine: \\"James Hilleary: A Colorist of Formidable Ability Plays Dual Role as Both Artist and Architect\\" review (1985)Washington Post: \\"Color School Graduate\\" by Ferdinand Protzman (1997)Washington Post: \\"Strathmore Reopens\\" (1997) (\\"A member of the Washington Color School whose abstractionists include Gene Davis, Tom Downing and Harold Mehring, Hilleary stains unprimed canvas with magna, the first oil- based acrylic paint\\") His work follows the general nature of color-field painting but is largely concerned with the manipulation of sequential stripes.Washington Star: \\"ART: Somehow, it Just Doesn't Seem Enough\\" by Benjamin Forgey (December 5, 1971)In fact, \\"Hilleary grew up a Washington Color Painter before there was such a thing.\\" He was doing the same sort of work as the seminal Washington Color School painters were doing, but he was working entirely independently and unaware of the work of those other artists. James Hilleary: Painting Retrospective at Edison Place Gallery in Washington, DC (November 1, 2003). Hilleary received critical acclaim throughout his career. Early in his career, the art critic Barbara Rose lauded Hilleary's \\"assured geometric abstractions\\" in an article in Artforum magazine, while The Washingtonian called his work \\"particularly promising\\".Potomac Current: \\"A One Man Show\\" regarding Hilleary show at Studio Gallery in Washington, DC (1971) Late in his career, the prominent art critic and professor Donald Kuspit described Hilleary as a \\"master of color\\".James Hilleary: Painting Retrospective at Edison Place Gallery in Washington, DC (November 1, 2003) And Washington Post art critic Paul Richard said that Hilleary was \\"admired enthusiastically by some of the smartest art minds in town.\\" Hilleary \\"is best known for his commitment to creating harmonious, expertly executed canvases in variations of a signature style.\\" His signature style revolved around his \\"interest[] in patterns as well as colors‚Äîpatterns not simply as decorative displays of color, but as on intricate arrangement of what the Futurists called lines of force.\\" Despite the centrality of lines and angles to his work, though, Hilleary has been described as a Lyrical Abstractionist artist. That description may reflect the evolution of his art. Washington Post art critic Benjamin Forgey observed that Hilleary \\"at first adopted the then- reigning hard-edge format utilizing relatively subdued optical color combinations\\" but over time his work evolved to show a \\"gradual release of lyrical energies, in which softer colors and thin, translucent overlays of paint have been added to the logical structure of interlocking vertical and diagonal stripes.\\"Washington Post: \\"James Hilleary\\" by Benjamin Forgey (February 12, 1978) James Hilleary in his Studio with one of his Reflections Series works Hilleary's work is found in numerous museums, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Phillips Collection, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and the Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Buenos Aires. Arts foundations and corporate collections that hold Hilleary's work include the Carl & Marilynn Thoma Art Foundation, Sallie Mae, Freddie Mac, the United States Federal Reserve Bank, IBM, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.

He was a politician and professor at the Law Faculty of San Sebastian who was assassinated by the Basque separatist group ETA.  Biography  Juan de Dios Doval Matthew was killed in San Sebastian on October 31, 1980. Seven days after the killing of Jaime Arrese. Juan de Dios Doval, 37 years old, was a Professor of the UPV/EHU Faculty of Law of San Sebastian. Also, he was a member of the Executive Committee of UCD in Guipuzcoa and occupied the second place in the list of his political party in the elections to the Basque Parliament. He was married with two children.  Murder  Minutes before 9:00 a.m. on October 31, 1980, Juan de Dios left his home and drove to the Faculty of Law, where he worked as a teacher. Once he was in his car, a blue Simca 1200, two young men without masks and armed with pistols approached Juan de Dios. One of them pulled a gun out of his anorak and shot him several times. Three shots hit Juan de Dios and they run away. An ambulance moved the victim to the health residence of the Social Security Our Lady of Aranzazu. He was dead on arrival. The Jesuit priest Antonio Beristain, Doval's companion at the University, told Gaceta Universitaria that Doval told his secretary on the eve of his death: \\"Pray for me.\\" She recommended him to abandon, but he replied: \\" I don't want to make my children think that I am a coward.\\" The day after his assassination, the activity of the Faculty of Law stopped and about 300 students and teachers silently marched from the faculty to the Provincial Council of Guipuzcoa. The killers had stolen a car at gunpoint around 8:30. Two assailants boarded the vehicle, leaving one of them in the back with its owner, who had been forced to move. The owner was chained in a field of the capital, but not before they warned him to not alert the police until three hours later. The same day the attack took place, ETA political-military claimed responsibility for it in a statement. In regards to the perpatrators, the only information known is that the two accused, Jos√© Mar√≠a Salegui Zuloaga and Luis Francisco Amezaga Mendiz√°bal, were acquitted by the National Court in 1982.

He established an important art dealing business with international connections in Europe maintained by his extended family. He originally trained as a painter and cabinet maker but built a reputation through his international art business. His children became art dealers who settled in various cities in Europe such as Venice, Paris, Vienna, Prague, Linz, Passau and Cadiz where they supplied an elite clientele with a variety of art objects. When in the 1670s Flanders suffered a severe economic downturn due mostly to an invasion by the French, Guillam Forchondt and his brother Melchior the Younger became art entrepreneurs by hiring lesser painters to create group projects such as large commissioned copies of famous works or large decorative objects. At one point, the Brothers Forchondt had 60 painters in service for export to France, Austria, Spain and Portugal.Guilliam Forchondt in the RKD * Matthijs Musson (Antwerp, 1598‚Äì3 November 1678) A painter and art dealer based in Antwerp, who helped popularize artists of the 17th century Antwerp school by marketing them throughout Europe.J. de Maere, Jennifer A.

It connected the Great Northern Railway main line with a new Hunslet goods yard, on the east side of Leeds. It opened in 1899, and was a successful expansion of goods facilities for the GNR. It closed in 1967.  History  Map of the Hunslet Railway and surrounding lines (1899)In the last two decades of the nineteenth century, Hunslet had become a thriving manufacturing suburb of Leeds. Influential local business people proposed a railway branch serving the district, and in 1892 they approached the Great Northern Railway to see if the GNR would build a line. The GNR was favourably disposed to the idea, but the issue became complicated. The East and West Yorkshire Union Railway, an independent colliery line in the Rothwell area, was negotiating with the GNR at the time with a view to selling its concern to the GNR. The GNR was sceptical, unwilling to pay the price demanded by the E&WYUR.; Possibly as a tactical ploy, the E&WYUR; said it would build its own branch from its own network to Hunslet. The discussions between the E&WYUR; and the GNR broke down, and the smaller company did not proceed with its Hunslet branch. The field was clear for the GNR and the local promoters. Carter and Ramsden among the promoters sent the GNR firm details of their proposal in December 1892, a Parliamentary Bill having been prepared; the line would leave the GNR at Beeston. The Bill passed in Parliament on 27 July 1893,Wrottesley, volume III, pages 69 and 70Grant, page 275Awdry, page 139Carter, page 480 and the Hunslet Railway was authorised, with share capital of ¬£360,000. In December 1893 the GNR agreed to construct the line, and to deposit a Bill in the next session to absorb the company. The absorption Bill passed, receiving the Royal Assent on 3 July 1894. The route would cross the Aire and Calder Navigation. There were proposals to widen and deepen the canal so as to bring ships into Leeds, and a swing bridge over the navigation was provided for the purpose. The GNR delayed construction, as it was in some financial difficulty at the time. During the period of dormancy, the North Eastern Railway announced in May 1896 that it proposed to build a Hunslet branch, approaching Hunslet from the north. The GNR and the NER investigated whether costs savings could be made by co- operation, but these could only be in the terminal area as the two railways would approach from different alignments. The GNR secured Parliamentary for an extension of time for the construction on 3 June 1897. The line was opened for goods traffic on 3 July 1899;Bairstow, page 63Article in the Engineer it never carried a passenger service. It was miles long,Some sources quote a length of miles, and refer to the line being built \\"to\\" the North Eastern Railway. These are misunderstandings. The line was built to GNR goods sheds at Hunslet. Between authorisation and construction, the NER built its own line to Hunslet, providing its own separate accommodation there. However there were exchange sidings, and the point of connection was at miles so far as the GNR was concerned. and it crossed the old Middleton Railway with a junction called Parkside. The Aire and Calder bridge had three large spans, of which the central span swung. There were exchange sidings with the NER branch from Neville Hill, which had been built in the meantime since the Hunslet Railway's own Act, but there was no through running connection.Joy, pages 58 and 59 General description Remains of the bridge across the Aire The Engineer (periodical) provided an extensive description of the works: The station and sidings covered an area of 23 acres. There was a large warehouse with ten 30 cwt hydraulic cranes as well as a 30cwt and a three ton crane. The site was provided with 8,000 yards of sidings. the North Eastern Railway had constructed a short branch line from Neville Hill. The branch line was double track. Closure End of the line in Hunslet Goods yard (Tarmac stone terminal)The section between Parkside Junction and Hunslet Goods closed on 3 January 1966,Bairstow, page 64 the remaining section from Beeston Junction to Parkside Junction closed on 3 July 1967. The swing bridge over the Aire and Calder Navigation was demolished in 1977.  Remains  Hunslet Goods yard is (2019) used as a stone terminal for the Hanson company and is served from Neville Hill. South of the canal, the route of the line has been built over, and near Hunslet Carr about of its alignment is now used by the M621 motorway.

The Fratraka rulers of Persis were local rulers subject to the Seleucid Empire since the 2nd-century BC. After the death of Antiochus III the Great in 187 BC, however, Seleucid rule weakened in its southern provinces, which allowed Persis under Wahbarz to not only declare independence, but also expand over the region of Characene, appointing Sagdodonacus as its governor. The precise date of the Persis conquest of Characene and Sagdodonacus' appointment is unknown. It may have been in the summer 184 BC, when Seleucid authority over its southern provinces seem to have been further weakened. In 164 BC, during the reign of Antiochus IV Epiphanes (), Seleucid authority was re-established over Persis and Characene. The expedition was led by the Seleucid general Noumenios, who replaced Sagdodonacus as the governor of Characene. The fate of Sagdodonacus afterwards remains unknown; he was survived by his son Hyspaosines, who served as the Seleucid governor of Characene, and later declared independence, creating a principality in the region, which would last till 222 when it was incorporated by the Sasanian Empire.

Constructed in 1849, it is the oldest remaining brick structure in Bradley County. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1976. History The Henegar House was constructed on the former site of the military headquarters of Gen. Winfield Scott at Fort Cass by Henry Benton Henegar, who served as wagonmaster and secretary under Chief John Ross during the Cherokee Removal known as the Trail of Tears. Henegar and his wife, Margaret Lea Henegar, returned to Charleston after the removal and constructed the home in 1849. The home was designed by architect William Baumann, and constructed in the Federal-style architecture. During the Civil War, the home was used as headquarters for both Union and Confederate Generals including William T. Sherman, Oliver O. Howard, Marcus J. Wright, and Samuel Bolivar Buckner. While Tennessee seceded and became part of the Confederacy, most of East Tennessee, including Bradley County, voted against secession and sympathized with the Union. Sherman spent the night at the house on Nov. 30, 1863, and it was there that he received orders to take command of a column of troops moving to relieve Knoxville. According to historic records, the back porch was the site of a tense conversation between Mrs. Henegar and Sherman, in which the general advised Mrs. Henegar, who was a supporter of the Confederacy, to leave the South for safety, claiming that \\"not even a bird would remain\\" in the south after he was finished. Mrs. Henegar rejected his advice and declared that she and her husband, who was a Unionist, would never leave. The Henegar House was listed on the NRHP on July 6, 1976. The house was added as a site to the Tennessee sites in the Civil War Trails Association's national tour in 2010. In November 2011 it was announced that painter Don Troiani had been commissioned by local businessman Allan Jones to paint the Henegar House. The painting, titled \\"Sherman Leaving the Henegar House - December 1, 1863\\", was completed in 2012, and is housed in the nearby Hiwassee River Heritage Center. The house was listed for sale in 2013.

The largest family is Colubridae, but it also includes at least six other families, at least four of which were once classified as \\"Colubridae\\" before molecular phylogenetics helped us understand their relationships. It has been found to be monophyletic. Morphological synapomorphies are defined as such from Zaher et al.

Traditionally the name \\"Colubroidea\\" was used for this clade. This was seen problematic, however, as many of the same studies that support this clade of snakes also advocated for the various subfamilies of Colubridae to be reevaluated as proper families in their own right. As the result of this, Zaher et al.

However, the film later went to American director Chuck Russell, who is known for directing The Mask (1994), Eraser (1996) and The Scorpion King (2002). Jammwal performs an animal flow style of combat for the film. His upbringing in Kerala and his background in the Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu helped him prepare for the role. As a Kalaripayattu practitioner, he grew up interacting with animals. With his prior experience as a stuntman, Jammwal performed his own stunts for the film, which impressed Russell. While talking about his first experience directing an Indian film, Russell said that he wanted to make a film \\"that is true to India, but uses the music, dance and the wonderful artists in Bollywood to tell a universal story about returning to the natural world\\". The principal photography of the film began on 5 December 2017 and was finished in the summer of 2018. Out of 100, four elephants were selected for the film after scouting in India and Sri Lanka. Junglee was shot in Thailand. The scenes involving elephants were shot in the presence of Thai crew members.

His most significant achievement was managing the construction of a canal system that transformed the Colorado Desert into a verdant agricultural development known as the Imperial Valley, CA, USA. He is also infamous for directing modifications to that same canal system which lead to the accidental creation of the Salton Sea in southern California, USA. Early life Charles R. Rockwood grew up working on his parents farm near Flint, Michigan, USA. Both parents were of Puritan descent. His mother was a direct descendant of John Robinson, one of the organizers of the Mayflower expedition which established the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, USA. From a very young age, Rockwood desired a good education. In 1878 he graduated at the top of his high school class. Immediately after graduation, he enrolled at the University of Michigan in an engineering program. Unfortunately, problems with his vision forced him to drop out. He intended to return to school and complete his degree but never did. Early career After departing the university he began working as a surveyor for the Denver and Rio Grande Railway in Colorado, USA. Over the course of the next few years he worked for several railroad companies in the capacity of a civil engineer. In 1889 he returned to survey work as an employee of the United States Geological Survey. A year later he became the chief engineer of an irrigation project in the state of Washington, USA. In 1892 he quit the position and moved to California. There he did survey work in Sonora, California, USA and the Colorado Desert, CA, USA, confirming the potential of irrigating those lands for farming. A favorable report from Rockwood on irrigating the Colorado Desert prompted his employer to create a subsidiary company named the Colorado River Irrigation Company. This company was tasked with creating a canal system that could deliver water from the Colorado River into the Colorado Desert for agricultural use. Because of the financial panic of 1893, the company failed before canal construction began.  California Development Company and the Alamo Canal  In 1895 Rockwood began promoting the irrigation project himself, eventually forming the California Development Company (CDC). It took several more years of effort to raise funding for the project. In March 1900, George Chaffey, known for several other successful irrigation projects, joined the CDC as an investor and engineer. Under Mr. Chaffey's direction, construction began on the first section of what would be known as the Alamo Canal (also known as the Imperial Canal) during December 1900. The canal was designed to bring water from the Colorado River to the soon to be named Imperial Valley for agricultural irrigation. Connection with the Salton Sea Map showing location of various channels (headings) in 1904. During the first couple years of operation, silt deposits built up in the upper section of the Alamo Canal reducing the amount of water it could deliver to the Imperial Valley. The lack of water caused great discontent among farmers and did significant harm to the ever expanding agriculture endeavors in the valley. In order to maintain adequate water supplies for farming, Rockwood was forced to dig additional channels to increase the water flow. In September 1904 Rockwood directed his engineers and workers to dig the largest of these new channels, bypassing the silt clogged section of the canal. The new channel was built without control infrastructure to manage the water flow because of delays in getting permits. The new channel solved the water flow problem, making water plentiful for all of the farms in the Imperial Valley. It also created a new problem. Since there was no method to control water flow, oftentimes the amount of water delivered to the Imperial Valley was far in excess of what could be used by farmers. The unused water was allowed to flow into the Salton Sink. This marked the birth of the modern Salton Sea. The first few months of 1905 saw several large floods from the Colorado River deepen and widen the bypass channel. Initially, Rockwood was not worried about the increased water supply and saw no need to stem the flow. Later that year fall and winter flooding of the river made the opening of the channel even wider. This caused the river to shift its course. Instead of following its usual course to the Gulf of California, the entire volume of the Colorado River flowed into the canal system and onto the Imperial Valley and Salton Sink. For almost two years the river ran unchecked into the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea. Many attempts were made to stop the flooding, but they all failed. Finally in early 1907, with help from Edward H. Harriman of the Southern Pacific Railroad, the uncontrolled flooding was stopped.  Later career  In April 1906 Rockwood resigned his position as assistant manager at the CDC and became a consulting engineer for the same company. Later that year, just before the flooding of the Salton Sink was halted, he severed his ties with the CDC and moved to Los Angeles, CA, USA. From 1906 to 1909 he worked with several different companies on various development projects in the Imperial Valley. During this time he also attempted to win compensation for assets of the CDC that the Southern Pacific Railroad had taken control of. He was not successful in his endeavors against the railroad. After 1909 Rockwood relocated to the Santa Maria Valley and oversaw the construction of several railways. In November 1914 he returned to the Imperial Valley and served as the chief engineer and general manager of the newly formed Imperial Irrigation District until 1919. Achievements, recognition, and criticisms Rockwood has been referred to as the father of the Imperial Valley. The efforts he made in creating a canal system to bring water to the Colorado Desert turned the region into productive farmland. His name is ensconced on streets, parks, structures, and other locations around the Salton Sea and Imperial Valley in recognition of his contributions. Several history books blame Rockwood for the flooding that occurred in the Salton Sink from 1905 to 1907. Some authors even going so far as to declare his actions criminal. While his actions did lead to the accidental flooding of the Salton Sink and creation of the Salton Sea, he made those decisions to preserve the existence of the farms in the Imperial Valley. His efforts to save the valley from drought would never have been necessary if the man in charge of construction for the Alamo Canal, George Chaffey, had followed the original plans. Unfortunately Mr. Chaffey changed the route of the canal, modified its design, and improperly constructed a headgate at Pilot Knob, CA, USA. If not for all of the mistakes made by Mr. Chaffey, Rockwood would never have been forced to dig the channel that lead to the flooding and creation of the Salton Sea.  Reality of the flooding in the Salton Sink and Imperial Valley  link=Special:FilePath/ColoradoDesertRegionOfCA.jpg During the flooding of the Salton Sea many newspapers focused on the threat it represented to the Imperial Valley. Many stories that were published exaggerated the extent of the flood danger. Charts that tracked the rising level of the sea were included with these stories, furthering the narrative that farms were in danger of being flooded. These stories were false. It can be considered understandable at the time, given they did not have historical perspective. While certain businesses like the New Liverpool Salt works and Southern Pacific Railroad suffered damages resulting from the flooding, the vast majority farms that existed at the time were not in any imminent danger. Based on the volume of the Salton Sink, Coachella Valley, and Imperial Valley it would take approximately 700 cubic miles of water to fill the entire basin up to sea level. Given the average flow volume of the Colorado River is about 14 cubic miles per year, it would take a long time to completely flood. When absorption and evaporation are accounted for, it would require almost a century to completely flood the region. Unknown at the time, the construction of Boulder Dam (later renamed Hoover Dam) would have arrested the flow of the river long before any flood waters reached the majority of farms that existed at that time. Personal life and death Rockwood was married twice. His first wife was Katherine Davenport of Vacaville, California, USA. They had one daughter, Estelle, who was born in 1888. His second marriage was to Mildred Cassin of Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada. He died on March 3, 1922 at his home in Los Angeles, California, USA at age 62.

He left a grim reputation for wickedness. Orme was the eldest surviving son of Robert Orme, of Woolavington, Sussex and his wife Dorothea Dawney, daughter of John Dawnay, 1st Viscount Downe. When his father died in 1711, and he succeeded to the Lavington estate, his neighbour, the Duke of Richmond took him up. He married Charlotte Hanway, daughter of Captain Jonas Hanway, RN in 1715. She died in January 1727, and on 4 March 1727 he married as his second wife Anne Lafitte, daughter of Rev. Daniel Lafitte of Bordeaux, vicar of Woolavington. Orme was appointed Gentleman Usher to the Princess of Wales on her marriage in 1736 and retained the post for the rest of his life. He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Arundel on his own interest at a by-election on 23 November 1739. He voted with the Opposition as a servant of the Prince of Wales. He was re-elected at the 1741 British general election after an expensive contest, spending money so freely that it was thought that the Prince was financing him. He consistently voted with the Leicester House party, although he was only a minor figure. At the 1747 British general election Orme was again returned for Arundel, with Theobald Taaffe, defeating candidates supported by his old patron, the Duke of Richmond. The Duke unsuccessfully tried to induce his candidates to petition ‚Äòagainst the bribery of Orme and Taaffe‚Äô. Learning of moves to turn him out at the next election, he wrote in 1748 to the Duke, suggesting that they should reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement relating to the borough. He became Gentleman in Waiting to the Prince. Soon afterwards he fell into financial difficulties. In 1750 a private Act was passed enabling him to sell or mortgage his estates and his daughter's portion to pay his debts. In 1752 he sold his East Dean estate for ¬£12,000. He did not stand in the 1754 election. Orme died on 20 October 1758 leaving one daughter by his first wife and an appalling reputation. According to tradition, he pushed his first wife down a well and when, in 1845, one of the Orme coffins was opened and found to be full of stones, the story was given some credence. It was also said that he hired a highwayman to waylay his daughter when she went to London to protest against his alienation of her patrimony. For many years it was a custom of the owners and heirs of Lavington to commemorate Orme by spitting when they reached the boundary of the East Dean estate.

It originally developed as an estate village serving Longhirst Hall, a Grade II* listed building built in 1824 by architect John Dobson for landowner William Lawson. The Lawson family became rich after the discovery of coal on their land, leading to the opening of Longhirst Colliery, which operated from 1868 to 1896. After use as a school and conference centre, Longhirst Hall has now been converted to private apartments. The village was formerly served by Longhirst railway station, on the Newcastle to Berwick line, from 1847 to 1951. Formerly part of the parish of Bothal since Norman times, Longhirst became a separate parish in 1875. The name \\"Longhirst\\" means 'Long wooded hill'.

Gutmann, also known as Gerrie Current, Gerrie von Pribosic, Gerrie Bollas (1921‚Äì1969) was an American post-surrealist painter from California. The imagery in her paintings was fantasy and often overlapped with autobiographical themes, expressing her struggles for an identity as a woman, an artist, and a mother.  Early life and education  She was born as Gerrie Current in 1921. She studied at the Stickney Memorial Art School in Pasadena in 1939 with painter Lorser Feitelson, a post-surrealist who painted in a more abstract hard-edged style. She was primarily a self taught artist. ‚Äú[H]er subscription to View and trips to Mexico and Europe...[helped to] familiarized herself with surrealist works.‚Äù Feitelson introduced her to artist Viktor von Pribosic (1909‚Äì1959), they were married and moved to Oregon however the marriage ended in divorce by 1945. The divorce caused a custody battle over their son, and in much of her work the imagery of childhood and loss are persistent.  Career  Surrealism is visible in Self Portrait (1946) where Gutmann adorns herself with biomorphic forms that suggest female genitalia symbolizing a birth, or rebirth process. By 1948, she had her first solo exhibition which traveled to multiple locations, including the Gallery Vivienne and Bonestall Gallery (both in New York), and the Harvey Weltch Gallery in Portland Oregon Gutmann was accorded solo shows at the de Young Museum in San Francisco in 1949, 1952, and 1964. In 1949 she moved to Northern California and married photographer, John Gutmann. During the 1950s, she rejected the trend among West Coast artists for abstraction over fantastic imagery and so became isolated from other artists. This is due to her having found a style that was best suited to express her inner turmoil and search for an identity as a woman, artist and mother. ‚ÄúThe work of Gutmann along with that of Dorr Bothwell, Eugene Berman and the Post-Surrealists are considered to belong to a broad sphere of illusionistic fantasy loosely termed magic realism. Those who look into her work find that she is more explicitly autobiographical and provided a release from the difficulties of her life- her abandonment by her father, the loss of her son, failed marriages, and alcoholism. Gerrie Gutmann and John Gutmann divorced in May 1964.  Death and legacy  Gutmann committed suicide in 1969, in her home on Sacramento Street in San Francisco. During her life she had thirteen art exhibitions in museums and galleries in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, New York and Portland, Oregon. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art retains in the permanent collection her painting, Death of the Bullfighter (1952) acquired in 2000 bequest by her second husband John Gutmann. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) has her painting, The Theft (1952) in their collection as gift from David and Jeanne Carlson of the Carlson Gallery.
