She and her husband George Snelson were considered the \\"father and mother of Palmerston North\\".  Biography  Louisa Buck‚Äôs parents (Elizabeth Frances and Henry Gregory Buck, a blacksmith) and siblings arrived in New Zealand in March 1842 on board the ship Birman. Louisa was born in Wellington on 29 January 1844 and grew up there. She met and married George Snelson in 1865, and the couple lived in Wellington for the first years of their marriage. They had two children: Frances Mary Halford in 1866 and George James Halford in 1868, however both died during infancy. Frances died at a few months old, and George was three years old. In 1871, Snelson relocated to Palmerston North to join her husband, who had gone there the previous year to open a general store and ironmongery. She took with her the couple's ward, Matilda Montgomery, who was 16 years old at the time. As well as working in the store, Snelson provided a letter-writing service for the newly arrived Scandinavian settlers in the district, took in boarders and cared for children in her home. As the town grew, Snelson became involved in church initiatives ‚Äì from October 1872, the Snelsons' home and store were used for Anglican church services and on 29 September 1875 Snelson laid the foundation stone for All Saints Church, the first Anglican church in the town. From 1877 Snelson was Sunday school teacher at the church, and she also developed close relationships with Christian MƒÅori at Awapuni. Snelson later led a fund- raising campaign to open a public hospital, which culminated in the opening of the facility on 21 November 1893. Around 1890 she also began a petition, and then a fundraising campaign, to erect a statue of RangitƒÅne chief Te Peeti Te Aweawe. Snelson was invited to unveil the statue in The Square in Palmerston North in 1907. After Snelson's husband died in 1901, she struggled financially and in 1903 she sold her home and moved to Sydney, Australia. When she returned to Palmerston North a few years later she earned money by selling paintings and giving art lessons. However, during World War I, she was also busy with patriotic projects such as organising donations of socks, stockings and mittens for Belgian war widows and supporting the local Patriotic Shop and the All Saint‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Home. Louisa Snelson died in Whanganui on 15 December 1919, and she was buried at Terrace End Cemetery, Palmerston North.

About the village Neganur Patti consists of small hillock called Adukkankal which is a Jain cave with prehistoric paintings, Tamil-Brahmi stone inscription and traces of the presence of Jain beds. Adukkankal Jain Beds Adukkankal Jain Beds The attractive feature of this village is the presence of hillock called Adukkankal. Since it looks as if large stones are piled up one over the other, it got its name (in Tamil \\"Adukku\\" means \\"pile up\\" and \\"kal\\" means \\"stone\\"). Just above the bottom of the hillock Tamil-Brahmi Jain inscriptions are seen. In the bottom of this hillock, two caves are located on the either side. Both the caves contains the traces of stone beds possibly used by Jain monks. Also a small pond is seen near to one of the caves. The floor of the cave were broken for construction works which needs protection.  Tamil Brahmi Jain inscriptions  Tamil- Brahmi Jain Inscription The 4th century C. E. Tamil-Brahmi letters on the adukkankal was first discovered by Archaeologist S. Rajavelu in 1992. The content of the script is \\" Perum pogazh sekkanthi thayiyuru sekkanthanni se vitha palli\\" (sekkanthanni, mother of sekkanthi of Perumpugozh village has built this abode) (). Archeologists believe that sekkanthanni to be a female Jain saint and the village Perumpogazh might be the present day perumpugai village which is near to Neganur Patti. Rock Paintings Men like images Another interesting feature of this village is the presence of 1000 B.C. rock paintings in the adukkankal cave.

General Jail Delivery, satirical engraving of the time of Lovell's first imprisonment; the publication The Statesman is shown held (back to the left) by a man talking to a barrister; towards the front William Cobbett holds The Register, and Peter Finnerty is shown in a piece of pillory. In 1811, Lovell was sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment for copying the reporting of Manchester papers on the conduct of the military at Sir Francis Burdett's arrest; in contrast the original publishers of the libel were only asked to express regret at their inadvertence. In August 1812, he was again tried and found guilty of a libel on the commissioners of the transport service; and although he pleaded that it was published without his knowledge or sanction while he was in prison, he was sentenced to pay a fine, to be imprisoned in Newgate Prison for eighteen months, and to find securities for three years, with two sureties.Charles Henry Timperley, A Dictionary of Printers and Printing (1839), p. 848; Google Books. Being unable to pay the fine or find sureties, he remained in gaol. On 23 November 1814, Samuel Whitbread and Anthony Browne, Whig Members of Parliament, took up Lovell's case.Roland G. Thorne, The House of Commons 1790-1820 (1986), p. 278; Google Books. Whitebread presented a petition from Lovell asking for a remission or reduction of his fine; and after some time the government remitted the fine and reduced the amount of security. Lovell was still unable to meet the requirement for a security, and on 17 March 1815 Whitbread again presented a petition from him, stating his utter inability to do as he had been asked, and calling the merciful consideration of the House of Commons, he having been confined nearly four years in Newgate. Lovell was ultimately released, broken in health and financially ruined. In 1817, he was again heavily fined for writing abusively about the evening paper The Courier and its editor Daniel Stuart, which closely supported the government. He further accused Stuart of dishonestly taking money belonging to the Society of the Friends of the People. Lovell died in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, on 27 December 1818.

Technique In this technique, a solid model of the component to be fabricated is made either by 3D imaging system or by designer using computer-aided design (CAD) software or by math data as an output of numerical analysis. Thus obtained model is sliced into thin layers along the vertical axis. The thin layers are converted into corresponding numerical controlled (NC) code and are sent to LRM station in suitable format (e.g. G&M; code). LRM station employs a laser beam as a heat source to melt a thin layer on the surface of the substrate/deposited material and fed material to deposit a new layer as per shape and dimensions defined in NC code. A number of such layers deposited one over another and it results in three-dimensional (3D) components directly from the solid model. Benefits LRM eliminates many manufacturing steps such as materials-machine planning, man-machine interaction, intermittent quality checks, assembly and related human errors etc. Therefore, LRM offers many advantages over conventional subtractive techniques, such as reduced production time, better process control and capability to form functionally graded parts. It is also an attractive candidate for refurbishing applications because of low heat input, limited dilution with minimal distortion and capability of adding finer near-net shaped features to the components. Similar techniques Manufacturing techniques, similar to LRM, are being developed with different names at various laboratories, such as Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENSTM) at Sandia National Laboratories (USA), Freeform Laser Consolidation at National Research Council (Canada), Selective Laser Powder Remelting (SLPR) at Fraunhofer Society (Germany), Selective Laser Cladding (SLC) at the University of Liverpool (UK), Shape deposition Manufacturing (SDM) at Stanford University (USA), Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) at Electrolux Rapid Development (Finland), Direct Metal Deposition at the University of Michigan, Automated Laser Fabrication (ALFa) at the University of Waterloo, Canada etc. References * Paul, C.

The Apology is addressed to the Roman Senate. Purpose of the writing The Second Apology was meant to expose the real reasons behind the recent persecutions of Christians under Urbicus. It also tried to expose the utter irrationality of allegations and propaganda spread against the Christians. Persecution of Christians under Urbicus Justin recounts the story of a certain woman who on hearing the teachings of Jesus and having become a Christian refused to comply with the immoral practices of her husband. Because the disagreements were severe she desired to be divorced, but not being encouraged to do so, she continued in that relationship until one day when it became ethically unlivable, and she gave him a bill of divorce. The husband retaliated by bringing accusations against her before the Emperor. But when he couldn't do anything against her, he turned against the Christian leaders whom Urbicus the prefect began to severely persecute. Demonic Control of the World According to Justin, it is the fallen angels and demons who incite such hatred and evil against the people of God - the ones who know the Son of God and have responded by faith to the Word of God. This view accords with the Book of Enoch (1 Enoch), which Justin viewed as scripture. These demons are the spirits of those offspring born through union of fallen angels and women before the Flood and who were destroyed by the Flood. They control humans through magic arts, libations, and such intimidating systems that hold people in bondage. They are exorcised by the Christians from people in the Name of Jesus. All in whom the Word dwells have been hated; Heraclitus and Musonius for example. Apology against Propaganda The Christians were being accused of cannibalism and sexual immorality. Justin asks that if that was the case, and if Christians were pleasure-mongers, then why would they be fearless of death and faithful to what they believe. Their faithfulness to Christ in face of death proves that they are not pleasure seekers. On the contrary, it was the accusers who had a system of religion in which noble men sacrificed humans to gods such as Saturn and in which sexual immorality was openly practiced without shame. He cries out: > But would that even now some one would mount a lofty rostrum, and shout with > a loud voice, \\"Be ashamed, be ashamed, ye who charge the guiltless with > those deeds which yourselves openly commit, and ascribe things which apply > to yourselves and to your gods to those who have not even the slightest > sympathy with them. Be ye converted; become wise.\\" Appeal He portrays the Christians as those who love God and His Word (Jesus Christ). He desires that this appeal be published that the world will not be superstitious about Christians and closes with the words: > And our doctrines are not shameful, according to a sober judgment, but are > indeed more lofty than all human philosophy; and if not so, they are at > least unlike the doctrines of the Sotadists and Philaenidians, and Dancers, > and Epicureans and such other teachings of the poets, which all are allowed > to acquaint themselves with, both as acted and as written. And henceforth we > shall be silent, having done as much as we could, and having added the > prayer that all men everywhere may be counted worthy of the truth. And would > that you also, in a manner becoming piety and philosophy, would for your own > sakes judge justly!

Mobley said that the close proximity to Georgia Institute of Technology, which houses the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), is the crucial aspect in regards to the commercial success to the technology center. In April 1986 the ATDC was fully leased. During that month he said the development was starting to receive spillover from the ATDC.

In 2000 LeCraw said that the land that contains the complex was likely worth $200,000 per acre. In June 2000, the complex had of vacant space. By June 2000 LeCraw & Co. had already partly owned Building 100. During that month it purchased the other four buildings and the remaining share in Building 100.

It has a total of 458 guest rooms and suites and conference facilities with 1,200 m2.  History  Construction of the InterContinental Vienna 1963 InterContinental Wien Lobby 1964 InterContinental Vienna, which opened in 1964, was the first hotel belonging to an international chain to open in Vienna. With more than 500 rooms, the ‚ÄúVienna Intercontinental‚Äù, as it was originally named, was not only one of the world's largest hotels, but also one of the most modern. InterContinental Vienna brought a completely new type of hotel with novel features to the Austrian capital: upon completion there were 504 rooms on 12 levels (until its destruction in 1945, Hotel Metropol, with 360 rooms, was by far Vienna's largest hotel). When the InterContinental Vienna opened, it was the twenty-third hotel to become part of the InterContinental Hotels Group, a hotel chain founded by the airline Pan American World Airways.  Architecture and Construction Method  Holabird and Root, an architecture firm that had played a major role in the development of the steel-frame skyscrapers in the United States, was commissioned to design the hotel, and in particular, to create a corporate identity for it. The Viennese architect Carl Appel was selected as contact architect.  Client and Architect  At the time he was commissioned to prepare and supervise the construction of the InterContinental Hotel, Carl Appel was a well established architect with a large, thriving practice. His office produced a number of buildings for the private and public sectors; these included office buildings, administrative buildings and apartment houses. Immediately following the Second World War, on account of their sound education and experience, Appel and colleagues such as Erich Boltenstern, Max Fellerer and Oswald Haerdtl played a role in the reconstruction of the city ‚Äì a task that demanded economical construction methods. In his work, Appel distinguished himself above all through his profound talent in tectonics and his willingness to employ new construction methods. The facade of the hotel's reinforced-concrete structure, for example, is clad in Tyrolean sandstone and small-format, colourful mosaic stone; the casting process employed was an innovation that made the cladding particularly robust.  Space at a Premium  The InterContinental Vienna is 39 metres high, making it one of the city's first skyscrapers. The original design of the hotel foresaw a height of 50 metres, but this was ruled out due to urban planning constraints: on the one hand, the famed view from the Belvedere Palace to Vienna's historic centre would have been lost, and on the other hand, a building of that height would have impeded the air circulation in the neighbouring park, consequently, and endangered its trees. In cooperation with the city's building authority, Appel took the context into account and reduced the building height. In order to accommodate the large program (504 hotel rooms, numerous rooms for social events, extensive building-services installations, and 240 parking spaces), he proposed a T-shaped floor plan and lowered the ceiling height to 2.45 metres. Because the hotel was fully air- conditioned from the start, the building authority approved the latter change. The reduced ceiling height was not merely an attempt to increase the hotel's floor area, but may also be considered part of a tradition dating back to the early twentieth century, when Adolf Loos developed his Raumplan: the height of a space was determined based on its use.  Today  InterContinental Wien Lobby Over the years, the interiors of the InterContinental Vienna have been renovated and revised. The present design of the lobby and conference facilities is the work of the interior architect Pierre Yves Rochon. Recent renovations include those carried out from October 2008 to June 2009: the British design firm Y2k created a new look for all twelve guest levels, the Club Lounge and the presidential suite.

Definition  Individuals experiencing religious delusions are preoccupied with religious subjects that are not within the expected beliefs for an individual's background, including culture, education, and known experiences of religion. These preoccupations are incongruous with the mood of the subject. Falling within the definition also are delusions arising in psychotic depression; however, these must present within a major depressive episode and be congruous with mood. Researchers in a 2000 study found religious delusions to be unrelated to any specific set of diagnostic criteria, but correlated with demographic criteria, primarily age. In a comparative study sampling 313 patients, those with religious delusion were found to be aged older, and had been placed on a drug regime or started a treatment programme at an earlier stage. In the context of presentation, their global functioning was found to be worse than another group of patients without religious delusions. The first group also scored higher on the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), had a greater total on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and were treated with a higher mean number of neuroleptic medications of differing types during their hospitalization. Religious delusion was found in 2007 to strongly correlate with \\"temporolimbic overactivity\\". This is a condition where irregularities in the brain's limbic system may present as symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. In a 2010 study, Swiss psychiatrists found religious delusions with themes of spiritual persecution by malevolent spirit-entities, control exerted over the person by spirit-entities, delusional experience of sin and guilt, or delusions of grandeur. Religious delusions have generally been found to be less stressful than other types of delusion. A study found adherents to new religious movements to have similar delusionary cognition, as rated by the Delusions Inventory, to a psychotic group, although the former reported feeling less distressed by their experiences than the latter. History Behaviours out of the ordinary were traditionally viewed as demonic possession. These episodes, although entirely disavowed by modern psychiatry, are evaluated by clinicians only such that they fall within the safety of a treatment programme. In 1983 propositions that religious shamans were motivated by delusions and that their behaviour resembled that of patients with schizophrenia were found to be incorrect. In a 1937 essay, Sigmund Freud stated that he considered believing in a single god to be a delusion, thus extending his 1907 comment that religion is the indication of obsessional neurosis. His thoughts defining \\"delusion\\" perhaps crystallized from the notion of the religion formulations of the common man (circa 1927) as \\"patently infantile, foreign to reality\\"; around the same year he also stated that religion \\"comprises a system of wishful illusions together with a disavowal of reality, such as we find in an isolated form nowhere else but amentia, in a state of blissful hallucinatory confusion\\". cited in: Prevalence Examples from a 295-subject study in Lithuania showed that the most common religious delusions were being a saint (in women) and being God (in men). In one study of 193 people who had previously been admitted to hospital and subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia, 24% were found to have religious delusions. A 1999 study identified that religious delusions were often present or expressed in persons with forensic committal to a psychiatric unit. Clinical examples Biblical Although many researchers have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious practices and experiences may be linked to mental illnesses of various kind (mood disorders, personality disorders, psychiatric disorders). In 2011, a team of psychiatrists, behavioral psychologists, neurologists and neuropsychiatrists from the Harvard Medical School published a research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to religious delusion and hyperreligiosity. They compared the thought and behavior of the most important figures in the Bible (Abraham, Moses, Jesus Christ and Paul) with patients affected by mental disorders related to the psychotic spectrum using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria (DSM-IV-TR), and concluded that these Biblical figures \\"may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations\\", such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, manic depression, delusional disorder, delusions of grandeur, auditory-visual hallucinations, paranoia, Geschwind syndrome (Paul especially) and abnormal experiences associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In 1998‚Äì2000 Pole Leszek Nowak (born 1962)Not to be confused with Polish philosopher and lawyer Leszek Nowak (1943‚Äì2009) also from Pozna≈Ñ. from Pozna≈Ñ authored a study in which, based on his own history of religious delusions of mission and overvalued ideas, and information communicated in the Gospels, made an attempt at reconstructing Jesus‚Ä≤ psycheLeszek Nowak, Prywatna Witryna Internetowa Leszka Nowaka at Internet Archive (Polish) with the view of Jesus as apocalyptic prophet.Analysis of fragments of the New Testament books for Jesus as apocalyptic prophet: Leszek Nowak, ‚Ä≥A great mistake and disappointment of early Christianity‚Ä≥ at Internet Archive (Polish) He does so in chapters containing, in sequence, an analysis of character traits of the ‚Ä≥savior of mankind‚Ä≥, a description of the possible course of events from the period of Jesus' public activity, a naturalistic explanation of miracles. Historical A religious experience of communication from heavenly or divine beings could be interpreted as a test of faith. An example of such is Joan of Arc, La Pucelle d'Orl√©ans, who rallied French forces late in the Hundred Years' War. Daniel Paul Schreber is an example of a supposed religious delusion occurring in a developed condition of psychosis. Schreber was a successful and highly respected German judge until middle age, when he came to believe that God was turning him into a woman. Two of his three illnesses (1884‚Äì1885 and 1893‚Äì1902) are described in his book Memoirs of My Nervous Illness (original German title Denkw√ºrdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken), which became an influential book in the history of psychiatry and psychoanalysis thanks to its interpretation by Sigmund Freud. The Harvard Medical School research also focused on social models of psychopathology, analyzing new religious movements and charismatic cult leaders such as David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidians, and Marshall Applewhite, founder of the Heaven's Gate cult. The researchers concluded that \\"If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population. This supports the idea that psychotic symptoms likely lie on a continuum.\\" Auditory hallucination and crime An individual may hear communication from heavenly or divine beings compelling one to commit acts of violence. Some cite the case of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham, who was commanded by God to sacrifice his son Isaac. However, when Abraham was prepared to act on it, God informed him that this was only a test of faith and forbade any human sacrifice. In contemporary times persons judged to have experienced auditory hallucination include those hearing voices instructing or motivating them to commit violent acts. These auditory experiences are classified by psychiatry as command hallucination. Persons acting to commit murder are reported as hearing voices of religious beings such as God, angels, or the Devil. Within the anti-psychiatry community, Professor Thomas Szasz critiques the concept of religious auditory hallucination: those who hear the voice of God talking to them are experiencing schizophrenia, while those who talk to God but hear no response are simply praying.

Founded as a monastic mission in Seoul, the community transferred to Tokwon in the 1920s to take charge of the newly created Apostolic Vicariate of Wonsan. The persecution of Christians in North Korea since 1949 made any church activity in the abbacy impossible. However the Territorial Abbacy of Tokwon is formally still kept as one of the few remaining territorial abbeys within the Catholic Church.  Foundation  In February 1909, German monks of the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien arrived in Seoul. Following the model used in their African monasteries, lay brothers established a carpentry shop and a trade school, while priests busied themselves with pastoral work and education. With the arrival of more monks from Europe, the monastery was raised to the status of an abbey on May 15, 1913. Fr Boniface Sauer, OSB, became the community's first abbot. When the Vicariate Apostolic of Seoul was divided in 1920, the monks of the Abbey of St Benedict took charge of the newly created Vicariate Apostolic of Wonsan. By 1927, the original monastery in Seoul was closed, the community of around forty monks having relocated to Tokwon. In 1927-1928, the monks built a minor and major seminary to train indigenous secular priests, while from 1929‚Äì1931 a church in the neo-Romanesque style was constructed. Around this time, the community began to cultivate local monastic vocations. In 1940, the Territorial Abbacy of Tokwon was created, covering the cities of Wonsan (where Tokwon is located) and Munchon and the counties Anbyon, Chonnae and Kowon. As Abbot of Tokwon, Boniface Sauer became the ordinary of the territorial abbacy, while at the same time he was charged with being the apostolic administrator of Hamhung apostolic vicariate. As World War II came to an end, the Abbey of Tokwon fell under the control of Soviet occupying forces. Though the monastery was for a time used to quarter soldiers, eventually monastic life was permitted to resume. By the time Soviet forces withdrew in 1949, there were around 60 monks at the Abbey of Tokwon (25 of them Korean) and around 20 sisters of the Tutzing Congregation in a monastery in nearby Wonsan.  Martyrdom  In May 1949 under the rule of Kim Il-sung the North Korean secret police occupied the monastery, arrested all monks and sisters and moved them to prisons and internment camps. In July 1950, the Abbey church of Tokwon was destroyed by American bombs. From 1949 to 1952 14 monks and two sisters were executed after harsh imprisonment and torture. During the same period, 17 monks and two sisters died of starvation, illness, hard physical labour and bad living conditions in the camps. Abbot-Bishop Boniface Sauer died on 1 February 1950, in a prison in Pyongyang, ahead of the execution of all senior monks in October 1950. In January 1954, the surviving 42 German monks and sisters were repatriated to Germany via the Trans-Siberian Railway. In May 2007 the process began for the beatification of the 36 North Korean Servants of God from the Abbey of Tokwon, martyred during the wave of anti-Christian persecution under the rule of Kim Il-sung. The process is entitled ‚Äúbeatification Abbot Bishop Boniface Sauer (O.S.B.), Fr. Benedict Kim (O.S.B.) and companions‚Äù.  Current situation  The Wonsan University of Agriculture was built on the premises of the abbey. The abbey's remaining buildings (former church and seminary and former rectory) are probably in secular use by the university. In 1952, some surviving Benedictine monks and sisters founded a new monastery in Waegwan, near the town of Daegu in South Korea. Today the abbot of Waegwan is the apostolic administrator of Tokwon Territorial Abbey, but he is not allowed to visit North Korea. Since the 1950s there are no priests or Catholic communities in Tokwon Territorial Abbacy or any other diocese in North Korea. Many Christians are imprisoned in Yodok political prison camp, just 70 km (43 mi) northwest of the abbey, and other prison camps in North Korea and subjected to torture and inhuman treatment because of their faith. Christians in North Korea can practice their faith only in secret and in constant fear of discovery and punishment.

It was followed in 1928 by the Akaflieg Darmstadt D-19 Darmstadt 2, a similar aircraft with a new profile, longer span wing. Development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. By 1927 the group were producing a range of designs traceable back to their 1923 Konsul and some of these were professionally built outside the University. The D-17, originally known simply as the Darmstadt and later as the Darmstadt 1, was one such. The D-17 was a wood framed aircraft with a high, cantilever, single spar wing with stressed plywood covering from the spar to the leading edge and fabric covered aft. Its 16 m (52 ft 6 in) was built in three parts, a 6 m (19 ft 9 in) inner section with constant chord and thickness and outer panels which tapered in both chord and thickness to elliptical tips. The D-17 had the thick, high lift to drag ratio G√∂ttingen 535 profile that Akaflieg had first used on the Konsul. Ailerons mounted on slightly angled hinges occupied the whole trailing edges of the outer panels. No flaps, airbrakes or spoilers were fitted, normal for the time. The fuselage of the Darmstadt was a plywood skinned, oval cross sectioned semi-monocoque, slightly tapered and more rounded towards the tail. The open, unscreened cockpit was placed immediately ahead of the wing leading edge with the pilot's head against the front of a low, long chord, faired pylon which supported the wing. A short undercarriage skid was attached to the fuselage underside, aided by a small tailskid. The D-17 had all moving tail surfaces with straight edges, rounded tips and tapered by forward sweep on their trailing edges. The large rudder extended to the keel, moving in a cut- out in the one piece elevator. In 1928 a close relative of the D-17, the D-19 Darmstadt 2, was flown. Designed by F. Gross, the main difference between it and the D-17 was the wing which had a 2 m (6 ft 7 in) greater span, making the D-19 an 18 m (59 ft 1 in) sailplane. The central panel span was increased to 7.62 m (25 ft). The D-19's wing area was only slightly higher, with the result that the aspect ratio was increased from 15.4 to 19.4. The D-19 used a more symmetric Joukowsky profile in place of the strongly cambered G√∂ttingen 535, so decreasing the pitching moment; over the outer panels the thickness/chord ratio reduced continuously from 15% to 8. There were also smaller refinements around the cockpit and pylon and a deeper, less rounded fuselage profile. Operational history The D-17 took part in the 1927 Rh√∂n (Wasserkuppe) gliding competitions. Piloted by Johannes Nehring, it set a new hill soaring distance record at 51.8 km (36.1 mi). In early 1928 it went to the United States where Peter Hesselbach flew it over the dunes of Cape Cod, one flight lasting four hours. The flights attracted much publicity and caught the attention of the young Schweizer brothers who later became important glider designers. The Darmstadt was damaged in a collision with a flagpole at the Cape, then was sold and rebuilt with improvements to the cockpit including its enclosure under smooth glazing which merged into the upper pylon line. Renamed the Chanute in honour of the aviation pioneer Octave Chanute, it was mostly flown by Jack O'Meara. Flight reported that a Darmstadt, as well as a Darmstadt 2, flew at the Rh√∂n meeting in August 1930. The quoted span suggests this Darmstadt, which won the junior endurance prize with a flight of 3 hr 19 min, was another Akaflieg Darmstadt model, but if It was the D-17, then two of the latter were built. The D-19 appeared at least three consecutive Rh√∂n meetings (1928‚Äì30), setting a record of 71.2 km (44.3 mi) in 1928 then bettering it with 72.3 km (44.9 mi) the following year. It appeared there for the last time in 1934, after which it was lost during a Scandinavian tour.

It's the publishing arm of the National Education service, and as such it performs editing, production and dissemination of educational and administrative resources for professional education, both for the ministry and for itself since 1992 (decree no 92-56). It contributes to the development of information and communication technologies in education (ICTs) as well as artistic and cultural education. R√©seau Canop√©'s baseline is \\"Le r√©seau de cr√©ation et d'accompagnement p√©dagogiques\\" (\\"The network of creation and learning support\\"). In 2014, it replaced the National Centre for Educational Documentation (Centre national de documentation p√©dagogique, CNDP) and its regional (CRDP) and departmental (CDDP) branches, with Directions Territoriales and Ateliers Canop√© as a unified structure under the name R√©seau Canop√© (decree 2014-1631, December 26, 2014), totalizing 102 places where teachers and people from the teaching community can borrow resources and attend training sessions. These and a few other institutions formed the Sc√©r√©n network (Services, Culture, √âditions, Ressources pour l'√âducation nationale: \\"Services, Culture, Publishing, Resources for National Education\\"). The network also includes: * the Centre pour l'√©ducation aux m√©dias et √† l'information (Cl√©mi); * the National Museum of Education (\\"Mus√©e national de l'√©ducation\\", Muna√©).  History  The name \\"National Centre for Educational Documentation\\" (Centre national de documentation p√©dagogique, CNDP) was first given in 1932 by the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. It became a public institution in 1954, following the merge of the National Museum of Education (created in 1879) with the central library, sounds archive and film library of the National Education, and the publishing service of the National Education. At that time, regional branches (CRDP) and departmental branches (CDDP) are only branches of the National Center for Educational Documentation (CNDP). In 1956, CNDP becomes the \\"National Pedagogical Institute\\" (\\"Institut p√©dagogique national\\", IPN). On September 9, 1970, two decrees separate the IPN into two distinct structures: the French Office of Modern Educational Techniques (\\"Office fran√ßais des techniques modernes d'√©ducation\\", OFRATEME) and the National Institute for Research and Educational Documentation (\\"Institut national de recherche et de documentation p√©dagogique\\", INRDP). In 1976, the OFRATEME takes the name of the CNDP, and the INRDP becomes the National Institute for Educational Research (\\"Institut national de recherche p√©dagogique\\", INRP). In 1992, the status of the structure is modified, making CRDP independent structures. Between 2002 and 2014, the documentation network of the French Ministry of Education was called Sc√©r√©n. It gathered the CNDP, the Centre de liaison de l'enseignement et des m√©dias d'information, the 30 CRDP and 86 CDDP and some local branches as well. Sc√©r√©n is also the commercial brand under which the various network branches sold their publications. On January 1, 2011, CNDP takes charge of the National Museum of Education, managed by the INRP.

He spent about four years in New Zealand, working as one of the most highly-paid officials in the colony, before moving to New South Wales to return to work as a solicitor. Early career and character Spain was born in Cowes, Hampshire, England, a son of George Spain. He worked as an attorney in London before his appointment as New Zealand Land Commissioner and was an active supporter of the Liberal Party. George Clarke Jnr, a clerk in the Native Department who served as a translator during the land claim commission hearings, described him as \\"a man of solid intelligence, but with a good deal of legal pedantry about him. He was somewhat slow in thinking, very wooden in his apprehension of ways of dealing with new emergencies, steady and rather plodding in his ways, thoroughly honest in intention, and utterly immovable in threats, though he may have been softened by flattery.\\"George Clarke Jnr, Notes on an Early Life in New Zealand, 1903, pg 47. Continued delays in resolving questions of ownership of land in many areas led to strong public criticism of Spain by mid-1843, although the delay was almost all due to stalling tactics by New Zealand Company principal agent William Wakefield. New Zealand Land Claims Commissioner  In August 1840 the New South Wales Legislative Council passed the New Zealand Land Claims Bill to establish a New Zealand Land Commission, which would investigate the validity of all purchases of land in New Zealand from MƒÅori prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, which transferred sovereignty over New Zealand to the British Crown. The inquiry, by three commissioners, was designed to determine who owned what land, in order to formalise and regulate land ownership in the new colony. In late 1840 Governor George Gipps exempted all New Zealand Company purchases from the commission's inquiry. The Colonial Office and the New Zealand Company came to an agreement in November 1840 under which the company would be given a royal charter of incorporation and also a Crown grant to land in defined areas of the country. On 3 December the British Government told the company that a commission would be set up to investigate all the company's New Zealand land titles, after which bona fide purchases would be confirmed with a Crown grant. British Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell selected Spain to fill the role of commissioner, to take effect from 20 January 1841. He intended that Spain be the sole commissioner, believing that having a British rather than a local government appointee would be seen as more impartial. Spain was given a fixed annual salary of ¬£2000, which equalled that of the Chief Justice and made the pair the second-highest paid public officials in New Zealand, behind the Governor. Spain eventually sailed from Gravesend on the Prince Rupert, an emigrant ship, in mid-April. Spain was accompanied by 13 members of his family, while the colony's new Surveyor-General, Charles Ligar, and five assistant surveyors were also on board. In early September the ship was wrecked at the Cape of Good Hope and the Governor of the Cape, Sir George Napier, chartered the brig Antilla to carry Spain and the surveyors to New Zealand. They arrived on 8 December 1841. Spain moved to Auckland, where he had bought a 110-acre block of land, and claimed superiority over the two land commissioners who remained of the original three appointed by Gipps.The original Land Claims Commissioners were Francis Fisher, Captain Mathew Richmond and Colonel Edward Godfrey; they had arrived in New Zealand in October and November 1840; Fisher, who had provisionally been appointed Attorney-General, resigned on 25 June 1841. Tonk explains (pg. 52, 53) that Lord Russell had intended that Spain replace all three commissioners but Governor William Hobson rejected the instruction, explaining the workload was far beyond that of one man. He proposed that either he remain in Auckland and hear claims from the Auckland district while the other two would travel to conduct hearings through other regions; or that he would review the work of the other commissioners, then hold hearings in Wellington with one of the other commissioners. Governor William Hobson refused the request and instructed him to proceed to Wellington immediately to investigate the New Zealand Company purchases defined in an agreement he had made with the company in September 1841. In that agreement the Crown indicated its acceptance of certain earlier land purchases at Port Nicholson, Porirua, Manawatu, Wanganui and New Plymouth, though the guarantee was conditional on the company proving it had fairly extinguished the Maori title. Spain's task, then, was to first established who had actually held the title to those lands bought by the company, a difficult task in itself, and then find whether the sales were legitimate. Assisted by interpreter and Sub-Protector of Aborigines George Clarke, then aged 19, Spain began his hearings in Wellington in May 1842. Within weeks he began encountering opposition and obstruction from the New Zealand Company's principal agent, William Wakefield, who had thought the hearings would be a mere formality. In fact Spain was determined to investigate thoroughly the background of all land purchases including whether Maori who had sold land had the right to do so. His interrogation of witnesses was exhaustive, with lengthy evidence taken and recorded in both Maori and English. Spain held further hearings in Porirua, Waikanae, Otaki, Manawatu and Wanganui and then Taranaki, where his commission opened hearings on 31 May 1844. Spain's decision at the conclusion of his Taranaki hearings became his downfall. From the outset of his Taranaki investigation he refused to accept the claims of former landowners who returned from slavery in the Waikato, a view that was strongly opposed by both his assistants, Clarke and Thomas Forsaith, a Maori interpreter and Protector of Aborigines. Spain closed his court on 6 June and announced that the company was entitled to almost all the 60,000 acres it claimed. The ruling pleased European settlers but enraged the local ƒÄti Awa Maori, who were restrained from destroying outlying settlers' property only with the assurance by Clarke that Governor FitzRoy would listen to their appeals. On 2 August FitzRoy arrived in New Plymouth and made it known that he did not agree with Spain's dismissal of the absentees' claims; in early October FitzRoy returned and confirmed that he had overturned Spain's judgment, declaring that all the awarded land would have to be repurchased from the Maori owners. The move infuriated Spain. His final inquiry, in August 1844, was into sales in the Nelson area, including the Wairau Valley, scene of the bloody Wairau Affray a year earlier. Spain's commission ended in 1845 amid great hostility between the Commissioner and the Governor, a continuation of the friction over FitzRoy's decision to overturn his ruling on the Taranaki claims. Their relationship continued to deteriorate, leading to mutual accusations to the Colonial Office and culminating in a demand by FitzRoy that Spain resign. New South Wales Spain left for New South Wales in 1845 and practised as a solicitor in Sydney until 1851. He was Inspector-General of Police from 1 January 1851, to 31 December 1851. Spain was appointed as Non- Elective Member of the first New South Wales Legislative Council on 13 October 1851, a position he held until 1 May 1852. Spain was again a member of the Council from 31 October 1856 to 20 May 1858, and built a family home at Waverley, New South Wales on retirement.

She was born in London, London, England in 1891. Her brother was the Rev. Arnold Spencer-Smith chaplain and photographer to Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Joan Elizabeth Spencer Smith was born at London, England, on 27 June 1891, the daughter of Charlotte Owen Gaze and her husband, Charles Spencer Smith, clerk and receiver of the United Westminster Schools and Grey Coat Hospital. Nothing is known of Joan's education before her three years of study at honours level for the diploma of student in theology, conferred by the archbishop of Canterbury in March 1915. She then taught divinity in a secondary school for girls, and in 1917 gained the archbishop's licence to teach theology. During the 1920s she was a tutor for the London Diocesan Board of Women's Work. She lectured church workers, including Church Army candidates, organised and gave lectures to women's fellowships in parishes, and conducted tutorials. In New Zealand at this time there was little provision for Anglican women to train for full-time church work. Campbell West-Watson, the bishop of Christchurch, hoped for the 'firmer establishment of the Diaconate for women', and in 1929 a diocesan commission argued for the setting up of a deaconess training institution in Christchurch. While in London for the Lambeth Conference in 1930, West-Watson was referred to Joan Spencer Smith, who offered to head the training school on a voluntary basis. She was formally invited in 1931 after General Synod approved the Lambeth resolutions and regulations on deaconesses and called for a wider appreciation by the church of women's ministry. This 'lady of learning, piety, and some private means' arrived in Christchurch in May 1931. There she became known as Joan Spencer-Smith. For a year the women's training house was based at the deanery, and then at Bishop Julius Hostel. The five residential students were joined at evening lectures by growing numbers of non-residential students, attracted by Spencer-Smith's lucid teaching on the Old Testament and doctrine. This wider interest reflected the name given: St Faith's House of Sacred Learning. St. Faith's was housed in premises made available by the poet Ursula Bethell Spencer-Smith and local clergy gave courses of lectures leading to one-year and two-year certificates. Students came from every diocese except Waikato, and Spencer-Smith helped isolated students by correspondence. St Faith's also offered short courses and provided spiritual and intellectual refreshment for visitors, including missionaries on furlough. The first deaconess to be trained by Spencer-Smith was ordained in April 1932, and the following year, on 1 November, she herself was ordained and licensed as head deaconess. Tall and statuesque, she wore a simple navy-blue deaconess dress with white collar and dark veil. Known for her sure vision, serene wisdom and calm confidence, she was a woman of strong convictions, yet had a twinkle in her eye. She was soon giving devotional training to lay people and teaching them subjects such as biblical criticism, which otherwise were only offered in the theological colleges. The principal of College House, Christchurch, sent male theological students to her for some of their lectures, and in the 1940s she lectured on the Old Testament at College House. In May 1935 St Faith's House opened in permanent quarters in a house in Merivale, gifted to the church by the poet Ursula Bethell. However, because of the depression, the diocese could no longer offer candidates bursaries of ¬£50 and Spencer-Smith met the expenses. By 1936 there had been 22 trainees and residents. Spencer- Smith had special leave in 1937 to be acting head deaconess of St Hilda's House in Melbourne, followed by a short holiday in England. There were few applicants for St Faith's in 1938 and then the Second World War intervened. Enrolments were also affected by the lack of openings in the Anglican church for the women who had completed their training. Spencer-Smith nonetheless started planning for her successor, preferably a New Zealand woman, to be trained in Australia. In 1943 she was invited to be the first principal of a national women's training college in Melbourne. She resigned from St Faith's, confident that the work would continue under a new head. However, her appointment was cancelled later that year, as the college opening was postponed. Although West-Watson and others reported that St Faith's had closed, Joan Spencer-Smith publicly declared that the work of training women church workers was only in abeyance until a principal and her salary were found. St Faith's never re-opened. After Bethell's death in 1945, the house was sold and, in accordance with her wishes, the interest from the proceeds was used to fund women seeking deaconess and further theological training in England. During the war Spencer-Smith pioneered (with Doreen Warren) ecumenical work among women through the newly formed National Council of Churches in New Zealand (NCC) and its Campaign for Christian Order. Joan chaired the Women's Campaign Committee from 1942 to 1944 and its successor, the Women's Committee of the NCC, from 1944 to 1947. She also instigated the publication of annual women's studies for use by home-based discussion groups exploring the relevance of Christianity. 'Faith & Pilgrimage Eight Simple Studies for Groups or Individuals', Women's Committee of the Campaign for Christian Order, Presbyterian Bookroom, Christchurch, 1943. 'Spiritual Housekeeping Short Introductory Studies in the Devotional Life', Women's Committee of the Campaign for Christian Order, Presbyterian Bookroom, Christchurch, 1945 This pioneering of group work among lonely young mothers was recognised as a major contribution by the international ecumenical movement. Joan Spencer-Smith had been a lay member of the Christchurch synod in 1941: deaconesses were ordained, but not recognised as members of the clergy. In 1944, when she took her seat at the all-male NCC annual meeting, she argued that member churches should nominate women and lay people to represent them on the council since they, as much as clergy, were the church. The churches were not yet ready for such an audacious suggestion. In preparing a report for an international ecumenical study, she was forthright in discussing not only the lack of opportunities for deaconesses to administer the sacraments, but also other disincentives to professional women's church work. In 1947, for health and family reasons, Joan Spencer-Smith returned to England where she lived with her sister in Bury St Edmunds. She left New Zealand, disappointed that the church did not fully acknowledge women's gifts of ministry. She never married, and died in London on 10 April 1965. The following year a new diocesan training house for deaconesses was established in Auckland. External links and sources More suggestions and sources Obit. Press. 3 May 1965: 2 Parr, S.

Foredunes consist of sand deposited by wind on a vegetated part of the shore. Foredunes can be classified generally as incipient or established. Formation Foredunes may begin as shadow dunes that form in the wind shadows of clumps of vegetation. Several shadow dunes may eventually join to form an incipient foredune. When an incipient foredune reaches a height of about , it has a significant wind shadow of its own. Wind-blown sand will tend to fall on this incipient dune rather than traveling further inland. When a foredune becomes high, it may trap all of the wind-blown sand from the beach. In active dune systems, the foredunes appear closest to the sea or other body of water. However, some dune systems, such as those on eroding coasts, do not have foredunes. In those systems, other kinds of dunes may be closest to the water. Landscape of Northern California parabolic dunes. A foredune ecosystem begins with the first dune ridge directly behind an active beach. The ridge of a foredune can range in height from a few meters to tens of meters tall. Foredunes are formed when sand accumulates and wind actively transforms the landscape. This results in sand sheets can consuming in-land ecosystems. United States Fish and Wildlife Service actively manages Humboldt Bay's Lanphere Dunes. Active sand sheets at Lanphere Dunes have been measured to be in excess of six hundred meters. Aerial image of how wind transforms Lanphere Dunes of Humboldt County, California.  Parabolic dunes in Northern California  Parabolic dunes are identified by vegetated dune ridges and vegetated deflated plains. Due to variable wind gusts, parabolic dunes are commonly unvegetated in troughs or dune swells where wind tunnels transport currents. Ripple alignment in association with the main dunes can also identify parabolic dunes. Ripples minuet accumulations of sand against the main dune swale. The heights of ripples are normally measured on a millimeter to centimeter scale. In Humboldt Bay, the wind is predominately blowing in from the northwest. As a result, the dune ridges are formed parallel to the wind currents while ripples are formed perpendicular to the wind.  Wind  Northern California coastal dune environments are subject to high velocity winds at all times throughout the year. This strong variable causes the morphology of the dune ecosystem to constantly change. Dunes can range in height from a meter to tens of meters tall creating elevation changes and habitat complexities. Invasive species can further armor dune ridges, creating linear dunes, and preventing naturalistic parabolic dunes from being created.  Sediment transport  Sand granules are transported in three ways: suspension, saltation, and creep. Suspended grains are fine granules that can easily be picked up by wind and carried for variable distances. Most visitors to coastal beach environments can attest to having sand blown in their face or leaving with a gritty feeling on their skin. This is due to fine sediment suspended in the moisture rich air. When suspended sediment is returned to the ground, granules physically impact the grounded grains. Due to physics principles, the grounded grains are receiving energy from the once suspended sediment. This impact leads to the dislodgement of grounded grains or creep of coarser grains. Saltation is the movement of grains being picked up by the wind and dropped in a cycling repetitive motion.  Sources of sediment  Coastal environments act as drainage outlets for freshwater river systems. As a result, sediment from tributaries and headwaters are deposited at the mouth of the river. Long shore transport is a linear current off the coastline that moves sediment. For Northern California, this current moves sediment in a northern direction. Therefore, sand and sediment constructing Humboldt Bay's thirty-four mile dune ecosystem, is a result of sediment deposition at a southern location. Sediment accumulation can also be a result of wave action. Wave currents occur in a swash and backwash motion. This continual wave action allows for the movement of sediment. The angles at which the swash and backwash occur, are associated with the off shore transport current as well as the change in winter and summer ocean currents.  Foredune ecology  The vegetation analyzed at the Mad River County Beach showed an evolutionary change in the ecosystem as a result of several thriving invasive species. Upon arrival to the beach, it became visually apparent just how abundant the Ammophila arenaria (European beach grass) species is. According to Pickart and Sawyer (1998), Ammophila arenaria is described as being foredune engineers. As Ammophila arenaria attaches and begins to grow on a relatively flat dune system, wind currents that push sand inland it allows the plant to accumulate and mound massive amounts of sand creating large foredune ridges. This shift is supporting the invasion of but not limited to, Ammophila arenaria, Tanacetum vulgare (tansy) and Bromus diandrus (ripgut brome). Since introduction of these invasive plants, scientists have recorded a severe displacement in native grasses and dune mat vegetation throughout California. A characteristic of Ammophila arenaria and Bromus diandrus entering an ecosystem, are elevated levels of nitrogen within the soil [8] . Unfortunately, the implementation of nitrogen into the soil, limits the growth and livelihood of other species such as Layia carnosa and Erysimum menziesii. Since the early 1900s, Ammophila arenaria has been introduced into the California landscape to perform as a natural re-engineering feature to transform the beach landscape. In areas without Ammophila arenaria, dune mat vegetation was relatively abundant and thriving. This data shows that with active restoration efforts to combat invasive species, land managers could sustain a healthy native vegetation population and thus transform the landscape back to its native habitat. Understanding how invasive species change and manipulate landscapes and the characteristics of specific invasive species, is the best way to reduce impacts and restore ecosystems for native species. Ammophila arenaria is an ecosystem engineer that has the ability to displace native dune mat vegetation by transforming historical dune ecology. Removal of Ammophila arenaria presents a daunting task for land managers and restoration teams. Ammophila arenaria has evolved to grow in‚Äúvigorous root and rhizome systems‚Äù. Research shows that these root systems can be in excess of ten feet. Characteristically, Ammophila arenaria invades the historically flat Californian foredunes transforming the ecology of the dune system. As wind currents push sand inland, the Ammophila arenaria begins to accumulate massive amounts of sand creating large foredune ridges. The alteration of dune morphology affects native plants and animal species that rely heavily on the dunes for nourishment and habitat.

Steele studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris before journeying to Florence. Steele returned to Paris some time before 1870, and was living in the city during the Franco-Prussian War and the time of the Paris Commune. He returned to Britain shortly afterwards, and exhibited paintings at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1872 and 1875. From 1881 to 1886, Steele showed etchings at the Academy. Steele married Marie Louise Alexandrine Piatti some time before 1871. They had two sons, Ernest Henri and Louis John Sisson Piatti (born August 1871). New Zealand career 222x222px Steele emigrated to New Zealand in around 1886, settling in Auckland; Marie Louise did not accompany him. He opened a studio in an arcade on Shortland Street. One of his early pupils was Charles Frederick Goldie, the most significant painter of MƒÅori subjects. In New Zealand, Steele painted portraits, racehorses, and scenes from history. Some of his history paintings were on a large scale, produced in collaboration with other artists. In 1898 he and Goldie collaborated on The Arrival of the Maoris in New Zealand, now considered the best-known history painting to be completed in New Zealand; it was based directly on Theodore G√©ricault's famous Raft of the Medusa. The contents of Steele's studio were auctioned on 16 August 1917; he died in Auckland on 12 December 1918.

According to The Economist, \\"PNG's governments are notorious for corruption, and ever run the risk of turning the state into a fully-fledged kleptocracy\\". Transparency International's 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 136th place out of 176 countries. Papua New Guinea is below the satisfactory levels set by the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), according to a report submitted by Transparency International Papua New Guinea (TIPNG) in 2011. TIPNG‚Äôs report found that in many cases, anti-corruption bodies in PNG were restricted by shortcomings in financial resources. Political and commercial corruption Political corruption in Papua New Guinea is largely enforced by political nepotism and the patronage system of governance. Elected leaders are inclined to seize and distribute resources amongst their electorates in order to secure and maintain popular support. This system of governance is embedded in Melanesian traditions, where the credibility and popularity of a leader amongst his electorate is defined, in part, by the wealth he is able to distribute and the power he is able to wield. This problem has been compounded, in PNG, by the model of 'politician-turned- businessman' which has dominated the post-1975 political landscape and has muddied the distinctions between business and politics, allowing politicians to divert public monies into their personal accounts. A review of medium-sized businesses in PNG showed that the majority are owned or part-owned by current or former politicians. Misappropriation by public officials was highlighted in a leaked cable by the US Embassy in Port Moresby, which observed that government revenues from industry had \\"served more to enrich the political elite than to provide social services or infrastructure. There are no large- scale local businessmen, but numerous politicians are relatively well off\\". PNG has enormous resource potential through its natural endowments in mineral deposits, petroleum, forestry, fishing and tourism. However, a 2010 report by Human Rights Watch found that in PNG national revenues from the extractive industries had been widely dissipated through official corruption, without leaving any discernible positive impact on the wider population. The conflict between Melanesian traditions of ‚Äòsharing and caring‚Äô, and anti-bribery legislation is often brought into relief during the election cycle. One candidate in the 2002 elections, Allan Bird, published an open letter documenting his experiences: \\"I was shattered by the attitude of people on my side of the river whose sole drive in life appears to be to live off government or MP freebies for the rest of their lives‚Ä¶ I have even had many individuals tell me in no uncertain terms that if I wanted to be an MP, I must pay (bribe) the voter because that ‚Äòis the way we do things around here‚Äô\\". A leaked diplomatic cable titled \\"Ponzi Politics\\" by the US Embassy in Port Moresby provided a critical forecast on the likelihood of corruption in the 2007 elections: \\"Now it‚Äôs election time (May 2007) and the politicians are dusting off their bottles of snake oil. Viewed from afar, or from a national perspective, it‚Äôs an appalling spectacle of disregard for governance.\\" In further commentary on the election process, the US Embassy in Port Moresby noted that each \\"election cycle has brought 12 months of budget imbalances and a time of seeming national fecklessness\\". In 2012, Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, when introducing in parliament a twenty-year corruption strategy, cited the following common corrupt acts by government officials and bureaucrats: * Paying bribes to acquire preferential service or treatment; * Theft of public money and illegal acquisition of assets by abusing a position of authority; * Breaching procurement processes; * Conflict of interest in decision making; * Nepotism resulting in the recruitment and retention of unqualified staff. Because of prevalent corruption, and despite a budget surplus, the national wealth has failed to flow down to the people. Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) has become \\"ineffective, corrupt and often abusive\\" according to a leaked diplomatic cable from the US Embassy in Port Moresby. One report by National Integrity Systems reported gifts and favours being offered to the police in order for cases to be ‚Äòswept under the carpet‚Äô. In 2011 the Police Commissioner took the unusual step of asking the public not to offer bribes to police officers. The Commissioner referred to the common practice of paying police officers to avoid fines for minor offences, and urged the public to let themselves be charged instead of contributing to the culture of bribery. Land and logging corruption In August 2011, the government of PNG launched a Commission of Inquiry (COI) to investigate improper leasing through Special Purpose Agricultural and Business Leases (SPABLS). The COI was launched following an early warning letter from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), sent on 11 March 2011. The findings of the COI have been delayed, but are expected to be tabled in August 2012. According to a report published by Greenpeace in 2012, over 5 million hectares of customary land had been improperly leased between 2003 and 2011 through SPABLs. The land equates to over 11% of the country and over 16% of accessible commercial forests. According to the report, 3.9 million hectares are controlled by foreign-owned companies and of these, Malaysian and Australian firms hold at least 3 million hectares. The evaluation and granting of SPABLs is managed by the Department of Lands and Physical Planning (DLPP), which is described in the Greenpeace report as \\"grossly incompetent and entirely corrupt\\". In August 2011, Transparency International responded to Prime Minister Peter O'Neill's post-election promise to \\"stamp out corruption wherever it occurs\\" by recommending that responding to the COI findings must be a priority.

Papua New Guinea: not ready for REEDMoney grows on trees The Economist June 6th 2009 Government anti-corruption efforts The National Anti-Corruption Authority The National Anti-Corruption Authority (NACA) was established in April 2004 and is chaired by the Police Commissioner. There are nine public sector agencies which work with the NACA with the objective of combating corruption in the public sector: Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, Office of the Public Prosecutor, Ombudsman Commission of Papua New Guinea, Office of the Auditor-General, Office of the Solicitor General, Department of Treasurer, Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs, Internal Revenue Commission, and the Department of Personnel Management. Though government agencies have conducted investigations into the misappropriation of public funds, little has been done to effectively address corruption. A number of commentators have stated that the police are too under-resourced to make any in-roads into fighting corruption. For example, the police‚Äôs Financial Intelligence Unit does not have sufficient staff to halt money laundering and fraud involving public funds. A US Embassy cable reported that a deficit of police resources was reflected in the lack of criminal investigations that are brought to trial. The Ombudsman Commission The Ombudsman Commission of Papua New Guinea is an independent institution mandated to provide a means of redress for citizens suffering from administrative injustice. It has the right to refer cases involving allegations of misconduct by government officials to the Public Prosecutor, who may subsequently refer the matter to the Leadership Tribunal. In 2005, the Ombudsman Commission stated that of the cases reviewed involving allegations of misconduct by public officials, 80 percent related to misappropriation of funds and 20 percent related to cases of ‚Äòpersonal benefit‚Äô. A review of the 34 cases referred to the Leadership Tribunal between 1976 and 1997 showed that 20 resulted in guilty verdicts. Of these cases, 17 resulted in the dismissal, suspension or resignation of the Leader from office. Anti-corruption strategy of O'Neill administration In 2012 the Public Service Minister Bart Philemon estimated that PGK1 billion [US$467 million] of public funds is lost every year due to corruption. Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said that PNG could no longer afford to pay for the cost of corruption. Upon his appointment as Prime Minister in August 2011 Peter O'Neill launched a much publicised anti- corruption drive. As part of this, he announced the future formation of an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) and the formation of an elite anti-corruption investigative team, called Task Force Sweep. When Task Force Sweep found there was evidence supporting allegations of corrupt behavior by Mr O'Neill, Mr O'Neill ordered the team shut down.http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2015/s4174033.htm National Anti- Corruption Strategy (NACSTF) Following his re-appointment as Prime Minister in the 2012 General Elections, O‚ÄôNeill announced the formation of another anti-corruption agency, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy Task Force (NACSTF). According to an announcement made in August 2012, the primary role of the NACSTF is to implement the National Anti-Corruption Strategy 2010 -2030, which had been ratified by the UNAC in May 2007. According to O‚ÄôNeill, the task force will draw membership from key government departments including the departments of the Prime Minister, Justice, Police, Treasury, the Ombudsman Commission, Auditor General and the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs office. The task force has been given a fund of PGK500,000 (US$146,500) for its formation. The NACSTF‚Äôs tasks will include: * Establishing a National Integrity Commission or the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC); * Developing legislation to protect whistle-blowers; * Developing a Freedom of Information (FOI) Act; and * Implement outstanding COI recommendations such as those made into SPABLs.

These functions primarily related to applications to use identifiable patient information without consent, in specific circumstances within the bounds of section 251 of the NHS Act 2006. These applications, which had been considered by PIAG before the NIGB, passed on to the Health Research Authority's Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG) on 1 April 2013. Care Record Development Board The NIGB had also replaced the Care Record Development Board (CRDB),Care Record Development Board archive page hosted by NHS Connecting for Health which had closed in September 2007. The NIGB had subsequently maintained the NHS Care Record Guarantee which was originally developed by the CRDB and developed a companion Social Care Record Guarantee. Members The NIGB had consisted of a Chair, a number of Public Members appointed by the NHS Appointments Commission, and a number of Representative Members appointed by the Secretary of State for Health from a range of stakeholder organisations. Representatives of several other stakeholder organisations had served as Corresponding Advisers to the NIGB but had not typically attended meetings. Regular observers at meetings had included representatives from the Information Commissioner's Office and the devolved UK administrations. The ECC had consisted of a Chair and a number of Members, all of whom had been appointed by the NIGB with advice from an NHS Appointments Commission approved independent assessor. The ECC Chair and two ECC Members had also been NIGB Members. Between 1 June 2011 and 31 March 2013 Dame Fiona CaldicottAppointment of Fiona Caldicott as new NIGB Chair - press release on NHS Connecting for Health website, June 2011 was Chair of the NIGB, succeeding Harry Cayton who had chaired the NIGB since its inception. Geography Members of the NIGB and ECC were widely distributed nationally but had attended meetings at the NIGB office. Since September 2011, this had been based at Skipton House, London SE1. The NIGB's staff team had been predominantly based at this office. Abolition As a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 the NIGB was abolished with effect from 1 April 2013. The functions delegated to the ECC with respect to research transferred to the Health Research Authority.Transfer of s251 function from NIGB to HRA The NHS Commissioning Board, later known as NHS England, is now responsible for providing advice and guidance to NHS bodies. Other functions were transferred to the National Information Governance Committee hosted by the Care Quality Commission.

Hazeland worked on several translations of the works of Russian scientist and anarchist, Peter A. Kropotkin. What became of his manuscripts is not known. Biography He was born at Birkrem in Rogaland, Norway. He was a son of John Hazeland (1838-1889) and his wife Serine Larsen Vigesaa (1832-1893). His father was a translator and an English language teacher. Hazeland passed his examen artium in 1876 and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.jur. degree in 1881. He was a deputy judge, junior solicitor and then attorney in Kristiania (now Oslo) from 1890 to 1907. In 1907, he settled in Strinda. He became an assessor at Trondheim in 1907, and served as district stipendiary magistrate in S√∏ndre Gudbrandsdalen from 1915 to 1919, then Supreme Court Justice from 1919 to 1929. He was also elected to Kristiania city council in 1898. In the 1909 parliamentary election he stood for his party in the constituency of Strinda. He was pitted against Liberal candidate Paul Andreas Olsen Fjermstad (1841-1921) and finished second with 1,052 against 1,096 votes. There was a second round of voting, in which the Conservative candidate, Even Larsen Loreng (1852-1942) edged out the other two with Hazeland in third. In 1912 he won the first round against both Fjermstad and Loreng, but Fjermstad prevailed in the second round. In 1915 he stood in the constituency of the Market towns of Hedmark and Oppland counties (Lillehammer, Hamar, Gj√∏vik og Kongsvinger), but Axel Thallaug (1866‚Äì1938) from Lillehammer carried the constituency already in the first round. Personal life In 1893 he married Anna Schj√∏lberg, a sister of judge Rasmus Schj√∏lberg (1860-1943). They were the parents of four children including Arnold Hazeland Jr. (1900‚Äì1977) who was a civil servant, attorney and judge. He died in November 1945 and was buried at V√•r Frelsers gravlund.

He later served as Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan. Early life Beavis was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, on 25 January 1895. He received his education at Bathurst District School and in March 1913 he entered the Royal Military College in Duntroon. Military career First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Beavis' course at the College was shortened and he graduated in June 1915, top of his class. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Assigned to the 5th Field Artillery Brigade, he shipped to the Middle East in November, serving in Egypt during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign before being transferred to the Western Front in April 1916. Initially serving in 4th Field Artillery Brigade, Beavis was promoted to captain in July. In 1917, he attended staff training in England and 2nd Division headquarters before being transferred to 14th Field Artillery Brigade as commander of 53rd Battery. Promoted to major at the time of taking his command, his unit suffered gas attacks in fighting near Ypres but his leadership skills ensured his post remained in Australian hands. The effects of the gas on his health saw him evacuated to England in November. For his actions, he was recommended for the Distinguished Service Order, which was duly gazetted on 14 June 1918. Beavis subsequently returned to his unit and on 21 April 1918, men of his unit were involved in the shooting down of Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron. The action was witnessed by Beavis, and in the ensuing investigation as to who shot down the German ace, Beavis placed credit for the kill with his Lewis gunners.Bean, 1941, pp.697‚Äì698 He was mentioned in despatches for the second time (the first was in 1917) on 28 May 1918. Interwar period Following the conclusion of the war, Beavis remained in England to undertake ordnance and artillery training and in August 1919, married Ethel May Blumer. Following a period of time at Australian High Commission in London, he and his wife returned to Australia in 1922 where he served in a number of staff and regimental positions. In 1928, he once again went to England to attend the Staff College at Camberley. Following his studies, he spent time on the Imperial General Staff, and then was subsequently posted for a second stint in London with the Australian High Commission. In 1936, Beavis was made chairman of the Defence Resources Board which was charged with providing the Australian government with advice on the mobilisation of the Australian industry for war. He repeatedly recommended encouraging development of the private sector in manufacturing prior to the outbreak of hostilities (at the time expected to occur in the Far East by 1939).Mellor, 1958, pp. 28‚Äì29 However, a counterargument that available funds should be prioritised for government factories found greater favour. Following the disbandment of the Defence Resources Board in April 1937, Beavis returned to his regular army duties. Second World War Beavis was promoted to colonel within weeks of the commencement of the Second World War and joined the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in 1940. He served in the Middle East on the staff of Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey, the commander of the AIF, holding a number of supply related positions. Promoted to brigadier in December 1940, he was successful in a new role of director of ordnance services and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1942. Promoted to temporary major general, he returned to Australia to succeed Major General Edward Milford in the position of master-general of the ordnance. He was tasked with co-ordination of private and government manufacturers and producers to provide logistic support for Australia's soldiers, both at home and overseas. As the war came to a close, he found his work becoming more difficult as Australia began to move away from a wartime footing. Later life After the war, Beavis worked in weapon and equipment development on behalf of the Department of Defence. On 1 January 1952, his rank was made permanent and he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Within a month he retired from the Australian Army. He served as the Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan from 1952 to 1954. From 1954 until 1960, he was honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps. He died on 27 September 1975 in a hospital in Heidelberg, a suburb of Melbourne. Honoured by a military funeral after which his remains were cremated, he was survived by a son and daughter.

Life He went into business at Stamford, Lincolnshire as a printer and book-seller at the beginning of the 19th century. On 15 September 1809 he started a weekly paper, the Stamford News.Dictionary of National Biography, Drakard, John (1775?‚Äì1854), newspaper proprietor and publisher, by G. F. R. Barker. Published 1888. The first editor was the topographer Thomas Blore, but he and Drakard soon fell out.The Reliquary and Illustrated Arch√¶ologist vol. III (1862‚Äì3), p. 9; archive.org. On 13 March 1811 Drakard was tried at Lincoln before Baron George Wood and a special jury on an ex officio information for libel, and was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment in Lincoln Castle, and fined ¬£200. The subject matter of the libel was an article published in Drakard's paper for 24 August 1810, entitled \\"One Thousand Lashes\\", which dealt with the question of corporal punishment in the British Army. Drakard was defended by Henry Brougham, but was convicted, even though the Hunts, proprietors of The Examiner, had been previously acquitted on the charge of libel for publishing most of the same article. Drakard was a defendant in other libel suits. He was horsewhipped by Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan for some remarks in the Stamford News. Cardigan tracked him to Northampton, and gave him a public whipping on the racecourse.Donald Thomas, Charge! Hurrah! Hurrah! A Life of Cardigan of Balaclava (1976), p. 42 and p. 57. Drakard was also the proprietor of the Stamford Champion, a weekly newspaper which first appeared on 5 January 1830, under the name of the Champion of the East. The poet John Clare wrote anonymous political satire in it.Alan D. Vardy, John Clare, Politics and Poetry (2003), p. 173; Google Books. In 1834 the publication of both his newspapers ceased, and Drakard retired to Ripley, North Yorkshire, where he lived on a meagre income. He died at Ripon on 25 January 1854, aged 79. Works The authorship of the two following works (both of which were published by him) has been attributed to Drakard, but it has also been doubted whether he had any part in their writing: * Drakard's Edition of the Public and Private Life of Colonel Wardle. ‚Ä¶ Introduced by an original Essay on Reform, &c.;, Stamford [1810?]. On Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle. * The History of Stamford, in the County of Lincoln, comprising its ancient, progressive, and modern state; with an Account of St. Martin's, Stamford Baron, and Great and Little Wothorpe, Northamptonshire, Stamford, 1822.

Garden appeal  Troops returning from the Second Boer War in Agapanthus's native range liked the plant, escalating its commonplace use in the early twentieth century. Agapanthus is often seen planted alongside fences in home gardens and framing driveway entrances. They also found lasting appeal at baches in New Zealand, for the extreme hardiness, salt-tolerance and very low maintenance.  Weed status  The plant has been listed on various weed registers since 1996, and is currently declared by the Department of Conservation to be an environmental weed. It is found on public land administered by DOC, including Kapiti Island. A. praecox has been recognised for its invasiveness in the Auckland region since the 1990s. (pamphlet) The former Auckland Regional Council (now subsumed into the Auckland Council) classed it as a surveillance plant pest in 2007. In the 2011-2016 Regional Pest Management Strategy the Bay of Plenty Regional Council classes it as a restricted pest plant. There was an attempt made at adding A. praecox to the 2006 update of the National Pest Plant Accord (NPPA) but the application was declined. The 2011-2012 update of the NPPA attracted debate when it was again recommended for addition. See also *Invasive species in New Zealand *Gardening in New Zealand References Ford, K., Dawson, M.

The editor-in-chief is Joanna Shapland (University of Sheffield) and the editors are Edna Erez (University of Illinois at Chicago), Matthew Hall (Sheffield University), Leslie Sebba (The Hebrew University) and Jo-Anne Wemmers (Universit√© de Montr√©al). It was established in 1989 and is currently published by SAGE Publications. The Journal focuses upon traditional areas of victimological research, such as offender typologies, victim-offender Relationship, victimization surveys, victim compensation, the victim in the criminal justice system, reparation and restitution by offenders and crime prevention for victims. The International Review of Victimology also looks at \\"broader theoretical issues such as definitions of victimization and the philosophy of victimology\\". This in turn opens the door to the consideration of political and human rights issues, including victims of war crimes, and contribution with a comparative perspective. Occasionally, there are special issues dealing with specific topics. Each issue contains reviews of relevant books.  History  The International Review of Victimology was first published in 1989 under the leadership of John Freeman and Leslie Sebba. The new journal was meant to reflect current developments in the field of victimology, in which leading experts in the field would have an input, not only as contributors, but also in terms of editorial policy and via the peer review process. Unfortunately, at the time of publishing the first issue, it was already clear that John Freeman would have to retire as editor due to health problems. David Miers, originally the Associate Editor, succeeded John Freeman as editor, working with Leslie Sebba, and Joanna Shapland became Associate Editor. As the number of submissions and interest in the field of victimology increased, so it was necessary to increase the numbers of editors. Joanna Shapland became Editor (subsequently Executive Editor) in 2002. The idea of creating an international journal in victimology was conceived at the Third International Symposium on Victimology, which was held in 1979 in Munster (Germany). Finding a publisher who was interested in bringing out the journal was not an easy task. Finally, John Freeman found AB Academic Publishing, a small privately owned company, which was owned by Ena Adams. ABA continued to publish the journal until 2011 when it was sold to SAGE. Since its start, the Review has been published in association with the World Society of Victimology, though it is editorially independent from the WSV.

In a career that lasted from May 1835 to October 1836 he ran ten times and won four races. In May 1835 he recorded his most important success on his racecourse debut when he won The Derby. Mundig was the first Derby winner to be trained in the North of England and the first of five trained at Malton, North Yorkshire by John Scott. Mundig was given a very hard race at Epsom and never reproduced his Derby-winning form: his subsequent successes came in relatively unimportant races. After his retirement he was exported to stand as a stallion in Prussia. Background Mundig was a powerfully-built dark chestnut horse standing 15.3 hands high with a white star and a white sock on his hind leg. He was owned and bred by John Bowes at Streatlam Castle, County Durham. Bowes had inherited a large fortune when very young. In 1835, when Mundig was foaled, Bowes reached the age of twenty-one and gained full control of his property and wealth: \\"M√ºndig\\" is German for \\"of age\\", but the Germanic umlaut was not used in spelling the name. Bowes sent his colt into training with John Scott who trained forty classic winners at his base at Whitewall stables, Malton, North Yorkshire. Mundig's dam was a mare named Emma, who went on to produce the 1843 Derby winner Cotherstone, and later gave birth to Mowerina, the dam of the Triple Crown winner West Australian. His sire Catton was a successful racehorse who once won fourteen races in succession. In addition to Mundig he sired the St Leger winner Tarrare and the stallion Mulatto. Racing career 1835: three-year-old season Mundig was unraced as a two-year- old, but his performances in home exercise gallops and private trial races made him a fancy for the Derby. He was the subject of heavy betting by the Scott family and by Bowes, although a great deal of secrecy surrounded his form, making him a very \\"dark horse\\". In April, Scott discovered that one of his stable lads had been passing information to bookmakers. Rather than expose and dismiss the lad, Scott fed him false information, to the effect that the colt would not run at Epsom. Mundig's odds lengthened and his connections were able to back him at 50/1. Bill Scott's riding of Mundig was harsh but effective. Ridden by Bill Scott, the brother of his trainer, Mundig started at odds of 6/1 in a field of fourteen runners for the Derby on 3 June. Confusingly, there were two horses in the race called \\"Ibrahim\\", one of whom, a colt owned by Lord Jersey, started 7/4 favourite. Heavy rain had made the ground soft and muddy, but did not deter the usual huge crowds who were entertained between races by \\"conjurors, learned donkies, posture masters, Punchinellos &c;\\". Several false starts saw the race beginning half an hour late, at a few minutes after three o‚Äôclock. Although the early pace was fast, almost all the leading contenders were still in contention as the field turned into the straight, and spread out across the width of the course. The closing stages saw four horses enter the final furlong almost level: Ascot and Lord Jersey's Ibrahim raced along the inside rail, while Mundig and the 100/1 outsider Pelops ran up the stands side. In an extremely close finish, Mundig was declared the winner by a neck from Ascot. The race was described as \\"one of the closest and best contested Derbys ever run\\". In addition to the winners prize of ¬£3,550, Bowes and his associates were reported to have taken up to ¬£20,000 in winning bets. Much credit for the win was given to Bill Scott, who rode a very strong finish, making extensive use of his whip and spurs. He had backed the colt heavily and was reported to have said on the eve of the race that he would win the Derby even if he had to \\"cut Mundig to pieces\\". According to the Court Journal, Mundig's win was greeted with great celebrations by his Northern supporters who waved impromptu flags and left the course crying \\"Yorkshire for ever! Mundig for ever!\\" Mail coaches passing through Yorkshire blew horns and flew flags in John Bowes black racing colour to mark Mundig's victory, leading one vicar to believe that the King must have died. Following his very hard race at Epsom, Mundig did not appear again until 15 September when he ran in the Great St Leger at Doncaster before a large and fashionable crowd which included Princess Victoria. He was not considered a serious contender on the day of the race, with his stable companion Hornsea being regarded as Scott's main hope. He was towards the rear of the field throughout the race and finished ninth of the eleven runners behind Queen of Trumps. On the following day he started 4/6 favourite for the Foal Stakes over one and a half miles and won easily by three lengths, having led from the start against weak opposition. 1836: four-year-old season On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Mundig ran in the Tradesmen's Cup, a handicap race at Liverpool in July and finished unplaced behind Birdlime. Two days later at the same course he finished second to the five-year-old General Chasse, from whom he received thirteen pounds in the two mile Stand Cup. At York on 3 August he won a King's Plate over two miles, beating Wentworth, with General Chasse unplaced. In September, Mundig was sent to Doncaster, where he finished second to the three-year-old Venison (\\"a first-rate nag\\" ) in a four- mile King's Plate. He then finished fifth of nine runners in the Gold Cup at Heaton Park, Manchester on 30 September. This appears to have been a most unusual event, with Mundig carrying 169 pounds and no horse carrying less than 136. Mundig's last two starts came at the October meeting at Nottingham. On Wednesday 12 October he finished third to Sylvan in the Cup and two days later he ran against the same horse in the two mile King's Plate. The race was decided by the first horse to win two heats. Mundig won the first heat, but appeared to have been beaten in the second by Sylvan. The judge however awarded the heat and the race to Mundig, to the astonishment of the spectators. Assessment Mundig was regarded as a useful but unexceptional horse whose form was \\"in no wise to be depended on.\\" \\"The Druid\\" (W. H. Dixon) described him as \\"a very moderate horse\\". The Sportsman magazine took a different view, describing Mundig as essentially \\"true as steel\\", but ruined as a racehorse by his excessively hard race in the Derby. There were persistent rumours in this period of four-year-old \\"ringers\\" being entered in the Derby, which is a race restricted to three-year-olds. The \\"winner\\" of the 1844 Derby was disqualified on these grounds and there were doubts about Bloomsbury and Little Wonder. Several later sources claim that Mundig, an unusually well-developed colt who arrived at Epsom surrounded in secrecy, may have been a four-year-old, the suggestion being that Emma's 1832 foal had been switched with his 1831 sibling. Stud career Following his retirement from racing Mundig stood as a stallion, with his stud fee in 1839 being 10 guineas. He reportedly became a very difficult and dangerous horse during his time at stud and was responsible for at least one death. Mundig's early progeny were disappointing runners and in 1843 he was sold for 400 guineas to Captain von Kotze, a Prussian breeder. He was exported and stood from 1844 to 1848 as a stallion at the Hauptgest√ºt Trakehnen stud in Germany. Mundig was then sold to another German breeder called van Saucken and died in 1852. One of his British foals, The Grey Prince was standing as a stallion at Badminton in 1865 as a sire of hunters.

Plot The plot of the novel surrounds Dan Starkey and his recent appointment as the editor of Belfast's trendiest magazine, Belfast Confidential; described by Bateman as \\"a cross between Private Eye and Hello\\". After the murder of his close friend Mark McBride, AKA \\"Mouse\\", Starkey is convinced by Mouse's Thai bride to take over the editorship and discover who was behind the murder. Starkey discovers that Mouse was working on a list of the 50 most powerful people in the area before his death and decides that those at the top are the most likely suspects. He sets out to discover if this is indeed the case. Reception The novel was well received by the media. In a review for the Daily Telegraph, Jake Kerridge stated that \\"the dialogue is extremely funny and Bateman obviously works hard on his easy-going prose\\". He further went on to state that he felt that \\"the wearyingly frenetic Brookmyre could learn something from Bateman's style\\". The Daily Mirror also reviewed the novel and called the series as a whole \\"compelling and darkly humorous\\", stating (given this being the second Bateman release of 2005) \\"the bard of Belfast is on a roll\\". The reviewer did state that they felt that \\"the plot takes ages to get going\\", attributing this to \\"too much introspective loafing and lager drinking by sad Starkey\\". The reviewer did temper this somewhat, however, stating that \\"Colin Bateman is clearly the right man, in the right place at the right time\\". Geoff, on-line reviewer for Opinionated Geek found that, as \\"it's written by a genuine Norn Ironer\\" it \\"gives it a bit more credibility\\". He goes on to state \\"And it's fun.

These verses may have been written by himself or by others for him, and usually had no connection with the original theme. There are several other versions of the song. One version was popular just over the border in Southern Scotland and of which Rabbie Burns, for one, knew and in 1796 wrote a satirical piece, Buy Braw Troggin, set to the tune.

History Former logo (2011-2014) BoxNation was launched as a free-to-air channel on Sky. It was soft launched on 14 July 2011, airing two hours of classic fights per day from Frank Warren Promotions. The channel fully launched on 30 September 2011, broadcasting live fights, magazine programmes and footage of classic fights from boxing legends including Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard and Mike Tyson. The channel screened its first live fight on 30 September 2011 as Liam Walsh stopped Paul Appleby in the tenth round at York Hall in Bethnal Green. BoxNation was later launched on Virgin Media on 1 December 2011. It also became a monthly subscription channel on this day. In 2012 BoxNation launched an iOS app for iPhone and iPad users as well as launching an online service via LiveSport.tv, In 2013 BoxNation made the app available to Android phone users. App users are charged ¬£10 a month to view the full BoxNation coverage regardless if they are already subscribed via Sky or Virgin Media. In January 2013, The Independent reported that BT was likely to acquire the channel and incorporate its content into their planned sports channels. Simon Green, the head of BT Sport, was a former Chief Executive at BoxNation and remains a non-executive director at the station.https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/inside-lines-green- light-as-ambitious-bt-throw-their-hat-into-the-ring-8449350.html In 2017, BT TV customers gained access to BoxNation as part of the BT Sport package. In April 2018, BoxNation extended their exclusive output deal with Bob Arum's Top Rank, meaning that the channel would broadcast the likes of Vasyl Lomachenko and Terence Crawford to British fight fans. Coverage Presenters and commentators BoxNation's programming is presented by experienced broadcasters Richard Keys, Jim Rosenthal, Paul Dempsey, John Rawling and Steve Bunce. On 15 January 2016 two new hosts, well known English presenter and sports personality Charlie Webster and Olympic Boxing Bronze medallist and Strictly Come Dancing star Anthony Ogogo launched a new weekly programme called Charlie's Web, looking at the world of social media in boxing. Programming BoxNation features live cards with domestic and international fights, classic match footage, magazine shows and interviews with current and former fighters. The channel has already broadcast over 70 live world title fights featuring Floyd Mayweather Jnr, Vitali Klitschko, Nathan Cleverly, Amir Khan, Miguel Cotto, Dereck Chisora, and Bernard Hopkins amongst many others Steve Bunce also hosts the weekly show \\"Boxing Hour\\" every Monday night. Bunce had formerly hosted a show with the same name and format on Setanta Sports where it gained popularity and acclaim amongst boxing fans leading to the launch of the \\"Bring Back Bunce\\" campaign after the collapse of Setanta Sports in Great Britain. In October 2013, BoxNation announced that they would show the entire Golden Boy on Fox Sports 1 series on a tape delay every Wednesday night at 7pm. Haye v Chisora and co-promotion On 8 May 2012, it was announced the BoxNation would co-promote and air the all-British heavyweight clash between David Haye and Dereck Chisora. The fight took place at The Boleyn Ground, more commonly known as Upton Park on 14 July 2012. Billed as Haye v Chisora: Licensed to Thrill, the fight received criticism from several quarters and was licensed by the Luxembourg Boxing Federation after the British Boxing Board of Control refused to authorise the fight. This is due, in part, to the press conference clash between Haye and Chisora in February in the aftermath of Chisora's defeat to Vitali Klitschko. During the course of the fight weekend, Chisora also slapped his opponent in the face at the weigh-in and spat water in the face of Vitali's brother, Wladimir in the ring preceding the fight. This trio of incidents led the BBBofC to withdraw Chisora's license to fight \\"indefinitely,\\" while Haye had previously retired and therefore escaped censure. As well as co-promoting the fight, BoxNation broadcast the event to UK audiences, while the fight will also be shown in over 60 foreign countries.

It is operated as a private company, but is a subsidiary of the Venerable Order of St John. Unlike other ambulance services in the United Kingdom, emergency ambulance and patient transport services are not free of charge. The service charges patients who do not have a paid annual subscription. Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service headquarters in Rohais, Saint Peter Port History The service was established in 1936, and within two years became Guernsey's only ambulance service when it took over the previous States Ambulance Service.See the official historical summary here. Initially operated by, and as a division of, the St John Ambulance, its staff wore the familiar St John Ambulance uniform, and used that organisation's white Maltese cross emblem, until the 1990s. It was the only part of the St John Ambulance Brigade to employ full-time ambulance personnel. The service was taken over by a registered private company, but with the Director of St John Ambulance (Guernsey) as an ex officio Director.See this list of Directors. The company operates as a business, but was (until July 2012) a subsidiary of the Priory of England and the Islands of the Venerable Order of St John. This is the same status as that enjoyed by St John Ambulance (England and the Islands), the organisation of which Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service was formerly a constituent part. On 1 July 2012 St John Ambulance in Guernsey ceased to be part of the Priory of England and the Isles, and was established as an autonomous Commandery of the Venerable Order of St John.See the BBC new report of this inauguration. Thus both St John Ambulance (Guernsey) and the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service (as sister organisations) remain under the umbrella of the Venerable Order of St John, but through independent local control, rather than the English Priory. Services Guernsey Operating 24 hours a day, the service provides accident and emergency cover and paramedic response, as well as a non- emergency patient transport service. Emergency cover includes the provision of in-shore search and rescue boats, and a marine ambulance. The original St John Ambulance marine ambulance launch in Guernsey was named Flying Christine. The current vessel, launched in 1994, is the third, and is named Flying Christine III. Emergency calls since March 2015 are routed through the Joint Emergency Services Control Centre, linking police, fire, ambulance and coastguard services. The service claims to be the only combined ambulance and rescue service in the British Isles.See this BBC news report]. Most British rescue services are associated with fire brigades, rather than ambulance services. Herm The service trains and supervises the small team of community first responders who provide the only emergency medical care on the island of Herm.Details stated on the island's official website here . The volunteers are trained to preserve life, including the use of oxygen, defibrillators, and other emergency equipment, during the typical 45-minute response time involved in getting professional paramedics to Herm from Guernsey. Sark The service also provides support to the small independent ambulance service on the island of Sark. This independent service operates two tractor-drawn ambulances,See the Sark Ambulance Service website]. and is able to treat casualties and transport them to the harbour for transfer onto the Guernsey marine ambulance launch.

With the far side of the river taken, the other divisions of the XXI Corps with their supporting artillery crossed and forced the Ottoman defenders to withdraw . With the Ottoman forces pushed back, Jaffa and communications between it and Jerusalem were made secure. The night crossing of the river has been regarded as one of the most remarkable feats of the Palestine campaign. Background On 16 November 1917 the British forces occupied the port of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast. However the Ottoman forces forced out of the town were still able to interdict shipping and harass troop movements from their positions on the northern bank of the Yarkon River‚Äîthe Nahr el Auja as it was called in Arabic.Tucker and Roberts 2005, p.1394 The British commander General Edmund Allenby needed to establish a defensive line running from the Mediterranean Sea which could be held with reasonable security once his right flank was secured on the Dead Sea.Hughes 2004, pp. 102‚Äì3 In order to consolidate a strong British line, it was necessary to push the 3rd and 7th Divisions, part of the XXII Corps, of the Ottoman Eighth Army away from the Nahr el Auja north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.Erickson 2001 p.173 The river was defended on the northern bank, by a trench system, from Mulebbis and Fejja to Bald Hill. From Mulebbis to the sea the river is between wide and deep except for the ford. The first attack across the Nahr el Auja, was little more than a raid, on the night of 24/25 November by two infantry battalions from the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade.Kinloch 2007, pp. 229-231Bruce 2002, pp. 158‚Äì9Moore 1920, p. 95 The outnumbered battalions, were driven back by the Ottoman defenders, as they recaptured the bridgeheads and restored the tactical situation.Erickson 2001, p. 173 British attack Build up Three infantry divisions of the British XXI Corps, under the command of Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin, began moving their units into position on the coastal plain on 7 December. The 75th Division was on the right with the 54th (East Anglian) Division in the centre and the 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left at the coast.Bruce 2002, p. 166 The 162nd (East Midland) Brigade, relieved the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade in the front line on 11 December and the mounted riflemen, who had been heavily involved in the earlier attempt to capture the Nahr el Auja, moved back to bivouac near Ayun Kara.Powles 1922, p. 170 On 14 December Major General John Hill, the commanding officer of the Lowland Division, submitted a plan for a surprise assault across the river by his division. Artillery was concentrated behind the lines, while the division's Royal Engineers, formed pontoons and canvas coracle boats, that were large enough to accommodate twenty men.Gullett, p.527 It had initially been planned for a heavy artillery bombardment to proceed the attack, however Hill suggested they instead try a surprise attack without the artillery bombardment. Then in the days preceding the attack, the artillery batteries conducted several engagements, mostly to suppress Ottoman patrol activity and registrar the guns on targets, in case they were needed in the coming assault. Over the night of 18/19 December, the 161st (Essex) Brigade from the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments, from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, moved into the front line replacing the 52nd (Lowland) Division. To cover the gap in the line left by the redeployment of the 161st Brigade the 75th Division extended its front westwards to include Ludd. The preparations for the attack were hindered by the sodden state of the low and swampy ground on the southern banks of the Nahr el Auja where the attack would be launched, made worse by three days of rain. Assault Over the night of 20/21 December in heavy rain the division carried out an assault river crossing, using pontoon bridges and boats. The 155th (South Scottish) Brigade crossed the river east of Jerisheh, and then turned right attacking the Turkish position. The 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade and the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade both crossed the river west of Jerisheh. The first unit to cross about a from the river mouth was a company of the 7th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), of the 156th Brigade.Grainger 2006, p.218 Several of the flimsy boats collapsed, and the men were forced to wade across the chest deep river. Once across they established a bridgehead on the Ottoman bank of the river. When they were secure the engineers started building a pontoon bridge, for the main force to cross.Grainger 2006, pp.218‚Äì219 By 23:00 almost three of the division's battalions had crossed the river. The 8th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and the 4th Battalion, Royal Scots, from the 156th Brigade and the 7th (Blythswood) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry, from the 157th Brigade.Grainger 2006, p.219 Pontoon bridge built by British engineers By midnight all the 156th Brigade had crossed over attacked the Ottoman position on a hill at Sheikh Muannis, which overlooked the river and all the other positions in the area. The rest of the 157th Brigade were not as fortunate, when they were crossing the river, being targeted by an Ottoman artillery barrage. However, by 01:30 two other battalions‚Äîthe 6th Highland Light Infantry and the 5th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders‚Äîhad crossed the river and secured the high ground overlooking the crossing point by 03:30.Grainger 2006, p.220 The 157th also secured the northern bank of a ford to assist the crossing. The 155th Brigade mounted two distraction attacks to cover their real attempt by the 5th Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers who, using rafts, crossed the river. By dawn the whole brigade had crossed the river and secured the heights at Khirbet Hadra. The whole division had crossed the river in darkness, and all Ottoman resistance was overcome by British troops using their bayonets and no shots were fired.Bruce 2002, p.167 The attack completely surprised the Ottoman defenders and their front line were forced back . By dawn the British held a line from Hadrah to Tel el Rekkeit, around north of the river. It had been intended for the ANZAC Mounted Division, to cross over and pursue the retreating Ottomans. However the rainfall over the preceding days and the damp boggy ground, prevented them from following the retreating Ottoman survivors, who escaped unhindered. With the northern river bank in British hands, the engineers constructed bridges to allow their artillery to cross the river. The next day, 22 December, the British position was made even more secure when the 54th (East Anglian) Division captured Bald Hill to the right of the 52nd. In doing so the Ottoman defenders lost fifty-two killed and forty-four more were taken prisoner. By dawn the 54th Division had advanced further north occupying Mulebbis and Fejja; later in the day they also captured Rantieh. The 52nd Division continued the advance on the left, supported by naval gunfire from a Royal Navy flotilla. Three destroyers Grafton, Lapwing and Lizard and three monitors M29, M30 and M32. By the end of the day they had secured Tel el Mukhmar the Wadi Ishkar and the Auja-Sheikh el Ballutah-Arsuf, on the cliffs above the sea north of Jaffa. During the battle of Jaffa the attacks by the two British divisions had forced the Ottoman forces back .Bruce 2002, p. 167‚Äì168 Aftermath Memorial to the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade, with the river in the background The battle was a success for the British, with 316 Ottoman prisoners taken and ten machine guns captured. The battle was mentioned in General Sir Edmund Allenby's despatch; > \\"The successful crossing of the Nahr el Auja reflects great credit on the > 52nd (Lowland) Division.

In March 1918, they were ordered to move to the Western Front in France.Chappell 1994, p.17 The 54th (East Anglian) Division remained in Palestine taking part in operations at Berukin in April 1918 and the battle of Sharon in September. The British units involved in the battle were awarded the distinct battle honour Jaffa.

O'Brien on Mighty Joe Young (1949), The Black Scorpion (1957) and The Giant Behemoth (1959). Biography Pete Peterson, who changed to this name in 1945, worked as a grip at RKO studios in Hollywood in the 1940s and was assigned to work on Mighty Joe Young (1949) lighting the miniature sets where technical creator Willis H. O'Brien and his first technician Ray Harryhausen were creating the stop-motion animation of the title character. Peterson became fascinated with the process and experimented at home in his spare time by placing tape on people‚Äôs arms and legs to gauge movement and filming the results to better understand the process of animation. As the production began to fall behind schedule Peterson volunteered his own services, and as second technician was responsible for several memorable scenes including the nightclub scene where Joe appears on stage for the first time and the escape in the truck. The film won the 1950 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. It was while working on this film that Peterson met and married his wife, who died three months later. Willis H. O‚ÄôBrien later asked Peterson to assist him on the production of the stop motion animation for The Black Scorpion (1957) and Peterson, who had contracted multiple sclerosis and was unable to continue working as a grip, accepted. The two spent a few months on set in Mexico before returning to California to complete such memorable scenes as the descent into the scorpion‚Äôs lair, the train wreck and the final conflict in the stadium. Peterson subsequently reused some of the sets and miniatures from this film to create his own test footage including the later-discovered Las Vegas Monster test footage. Eugene Louri√®, the original director of The Black Scorpion who had hired O‚ÄôBrien for that film, contacted O‚ÄôBrien and Peterson again regarding the effects work on The Giant Behemoth (1959), but producer David Diamond hired visual effects supervisors Jack Rabin and Irving Block, who subcontracted the stop-motion animation back to O‚ÄôBrien and Peterson on a meagre portion of the total $20,000 effects budget. O‚ÄôBrien and Peterson nevertheless came up with innovative solutions to the problems presented by the limited budget and Peterson‚Äôs physical deterioration, which required miniature sets be built close to the ground so Peterson could animate whilst seated. After the film Peterson again worked on his own test footage including the colour Beetlemen test footage. Peterson was diagnosed with kidney cancer and died whilst in surgery in February 1962, and O‚ÄôBrien died in November of that same year. Some years after the deaths of Peterson and O‚ÄôBrien a group of young animators, including Jim Danforth and Dennis Muren, discovered a trunk containing Peterson‚Äôs test footage and models, which they used on the production of Flesh Gordon (1974). Test films Las Vegas Monster test footage Las Vegas Monster is a 1958 American short black-and-white silent animated test film, animated and directed by Pete Peterson, featuring a giant mutated baboon on the rampage. The film was discovered along with the Beetlemen test footage and some of the models used in these and other productions in a trunk recovered from the wife of a former neighbour of Peterson after his death in 1962. One of the young animators who discovered the trunk was Laine Liska who used the armature of the Las Vegas Monster model to create the Great God Porno animated by David W. Allen, Jim Aupperle, and Robert Maine in Flesh Gordon (1974). Beetlemen test footage Beetlemen is a 1960 American short silent animated test film, animated and directed by Pete Peterson, featuring a group of mutated human astronauts, who were trapped in suspended animation in a pressure chamber, marching over a hill. The film was discovered along with the Las Vegas Monster test footage and some of the models used in these and other productions in a trunk recovered from the wife of a former neighbour of Peterson after his death in 1962. One of the young animators who discovered the trunk was Jim Danforth who used one of the Beetlemen models in Flesh Gordon (1974).

Lolland continued to serve with the Norwegian Navy until sold in 1847. Dano-Norwegian navy For three months from 9 June 1810, Lolland served as a training ship for naval cadets at Copenhagen naval base. At the time she was under the command of Senior Lieutenant (later Captain) Holger Johan Bahnsen.Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol 1, p.56. Also on board was Senior Lieutenant Georg Joachim Grodtschilling, a mathematics teacher at the naval academy.Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol 1, pp.481-2.Georg Grodtschilling was killed aboard Najaden at the Battle of Lyng√∏r in 1812. ;1811 On 6 March 1811, Lolland sailed to her new station as part of the naval defences of southern Norway, where she was the command ship for a division of brigs. The year would be a tumultuous one for Lolland as she would engage in three actions against British warships under her new captain, Hans Peter Holm.Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol. 1. pp. 598-601 By the 1 May 1811, Lolland had returned to the southern approaches to Egersund (SW Norway) with four other brigs,Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol 1, p.599Wandell (1915), p.368. unknown to the British.O'Bryne (1849), p.274. The British sent four boats from , and ,Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.14. into the western end of the sound, expecting to capture some shipping or do other mischief. The circumstances of locality and wind did not permit the Danish brigs to enter the sound from the further end, but Holm sent the Danish ships‚Äô boats under Lieutenant Niels Gerhardt Langemach Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol 2, p.68. to oppose the British. Some of the Danes landed to set an ambush from the cliff tops, whilst the armed boats were hidden behind a skerry. As the British rowed boldly in, they met unexpected fire from howitzers and muskets; they immediately withdrew, with the Danish boats in pursuit. The Danes captured one of the British boats and her crew of an officer and 17 men, who had come from Belette, and would have captured more but for the confusion that the explosion of a powder keg on one of the Danish boats caused. This enabled the remaining British boats to reach the protection of their squadron. On 31 July 1811, Lolland, in company with the brigs Lougen and Kiel, encountered and cruising together in Long Sound, Norway. The Danes had 54 guns and 480 men, against the British 22 guns and 107 men.The Naval Chronicle gives the Danish strength as 60 guns (all long 18-pounders), and 550 men. Outnumbered and outgunned, the British vessels took flight.Naval Chronicle Vol. 26 (Jul-Dec 1811), pp.284-6. The next day Brev Drageren unsuccessfully re-engaged first one and then two of the brigs. In the inconclusive engagement each British vessel sustained one man killed, and Brev Drageren also had three wounded. In the second day‚Äôs fight, Algerine sent a boat and sweeps to Brev Drageren, which helped her escape the Danes, though not until after her crew had rowed for 30 hours.James (1837), Vol. 5, p.346. Lolland captured two cargo ships (galleases) that Brev Drageren had been escorting.Wandell (1915), p.369. On 17 August 1811 sailed from Sheerness with a convoy for the Baltic under Lieutenant Richard William Simmonds. On 2 September 1811, off Rand√∏erne, some 30 miles SE of Arendal on the Norwegian coast in company with they encountered three Danish 18-gun- brigs: Lolland, Alsen (Senior Lieutenant M. L√ºtken), and Sams√∏ (Senior Lieutenant Ridder F. Grodtschilling). The Danish brigs were sailing westward along the coast when they sighted the two strange vessels, which by their night signals appeared to be enemy.Fra Krigens Tid - Allart and Manly The Danes set out in pursuit, with Sams√∏, which was closest, sailing for the nearer of the enemy vessels, Alsen and Lolland following. However, their quarry - the Chanticleer turned south-east, and Sams√∏ and Alsen followed. Lolland then set off after the second ship, the Manly. By 0340hrs Lolland had caught up with Manly. Combat began at 0445hrs and at 0540hrs Lolland succeeded in crossing behind her quarry, which then struck at 0555hrs. Lolland sent a prize crew over that brought back Lieutenant Simmonds, of Manly. In rough seas, neither Alsen nor Sams√∏e could catch HMS Chanticleer and so gave up the chase. Lolland had lost one man killed but had had no wounded; neither of the other two Danish vessels had sustained any casualties. Lolland had slight damage to her rigging and sails, but none to her hull; the other two Danish vessels reported negligible damage. The Danes took Manly into service, retaining her name and armament.Orlogsmusset (Naval Museum) but see note below Later that year, Captain Anthonius Krieger replaced Holm as captain of Lolland.Tops√∏e-Jensen, Vol. 2, pp. 38-9. ;1812 In 1812, the Danish-Norwegian naval forces based in Norway were utilizing a sheltered but weakly defended anchorage at Sandoya. The Dano-Norwegian force consisted of the frigate Najaden, three brigs - Lolland, Kiel (under the command of Otto Frederick Rasch),Translated from the Danish website . and Sams√∏e - as well as a number of gunboats. The British saw an opportunity to break the back of Dano- Norwegian seapower and sent the 64-gun Third Rate ship-of-the-line and three brigs, the 18-gun Cruizer class brig-sloop , 14-gun brig-sloop and the 14-gun gun brig to seek out the Danes. The encounter took place on 6 July 1812 at Lyng√∏r. The British sank Najaden and took Lolland and Kiel as prizes. However the British had to abandon their prizes after the two vessels grounded. The British did not set fire to either as they still had their crews and wounded aboard. The action cost the British nine men killed, 26 wounded, and two missing. Overall, the Danes acknowledged losing 300 men killed or wounded. ;1813 In late December 1813 Lolland, The Seagull, and Sams√∏e sailed to Frederickshavn, Jutland to escort a convoy of some 45 vessels carrying much- needed grain to Norway. They succeeded in their mission, although they lost one of the grain ships to a Swedish privateer. During the mission, a storm forced Sams√∏e to seek shelter in Danish waters; as a result, at the separation of Norway from Denmark, Sams√∏e remained with the Danish navyFra Krigens Tid - The Norwegian Navy 1814, until 1819.Record Card for Sams√∏e but see note below Norwegian Navy The separation in 1814 after the Treaty of Kiel of Norway from Denmark left Norway with a severely depleted cadre of naval officers and six active-duty brigs, of which Lolland was the largest. In May Budde took command of Lolland, which became the command ship of the Norwegian navy‚Äôs brig squadron. The brigs Lolland, Seagull, Alsen and Kiel had sailed to Frederickhavn to escort a large convoy of some 80 much-needed grain ships from Denmark to Norway. In the Skagerrak two Swedish frigates, the Eurydice (44) and the af Chapman (36), tried to capture the convoy and its escorts but the Eurydice was too far way to be effective. The four Norwegian brigs, under orders not to fire unless first fired on, boxed in the af Chapman until the convoy successfully reached Norwegian waters. Fate Lolland received a major refit in 1831.

Gameplay Furmins is a blend of physics-based \\"set-up-and-go\\" gameplay and real-time interaction. To complete each level, the player is required to herd the Furmins from the level's starting point to its end point ‚Äîin this case, a basket. This is accomplished by solving a puzzle which incorporates physical chain reactions between various items and the Furmins. Solving each puzzle is a two-step process: 1) \\"Setup Mode\\": the player strategically places items in order to create pathways and physical reactions between the Furmins and the items. The goal is to arrange the items in such a way that all of the Furmins arrive safely in the basket. 2) \\"Action Mode\\": when the player is satisfied with the setup, they engage \\"Action Mode\\", in which the physics are turned on and the Furmins and the level items interact. In addition to watching the results of their setup, the player can interact in real-time with the moving items and the Furmins via well-timed usage of bumpers and conveyor belts. A successful solution to a puzzle sees all of the Furmins reach the basket, at which point the level is passed. Iteration in both Setup Mode and Action Mode is rapid. Players can manipulate and customize each game level in Setup Mode, and can soon see if their solution worked once Action Mode is engaged. Also, there are multiple solutions to each level, providing a significant amount of creative flexibility for players. Plot Furmins tells the story of its titular main characters, a cuddly race of creatures living a happy, peaceful existence until one day when their benevolent King falls asleep and rolls over a river, thus forming an impromptu dam and blocking the flow of water. Without water from the river the Furmins' existence is threatened, and so they embark on a quest to reach their King and wake him up.

History The P√©poi is a traditional farmhouse breed of north- eastern Italy, and of Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the north-eastern part of the Veneto in particular. It is one of the few dwarf breeds in Italy, others being the Mericanel della Brianza and the Mugellese.

The project includes among its aims the conservation of local avian species of limited distribution, and the conservation of genetic resources and biodiversity, and has published a detailed description of the breed. In early 2012, the P√©poi was not officially recognised by the Federazione Italiana Associazioni Avicole, but was under consideration. Critics have suggested that the characteristics of the P√©poi are too variable for it to be considered a breed. Breed numbers remain low. A study published in 2007 used a figure of approximately 550 for the total breeding stock, of which approximately 50 were cocks. Characteristics The colouring of the P√©poi is golden (partridge). The skin and legs are yellow. Average weight is for cocks, for hens. The eggs are pinkish brown and weigh 40‚Äì45 g. Uses The P√©poi is a dual-purpose breed. Hens lay 160‚Äì180 eggs per year. In meat production, birds reach a weight of 600‚Äì700 g in four months, and are suitable as a single portion or for the spit. The meat is well-flavoured.

Strike Fighter Weapons School Pacific at NAS Lemoore is the United States Pacific Fleet equivalent. The beginning of weapons schools In 1963, a weapons training center was established to support NAS Lemoore's light attack fleet training syllabus. Part of this command was VFA-122 and VFA-125, and it evolved into a graduate level weapons school. The growth and sophistication in weapons delivery established Light Attack Weapons School, Pacific as a parallel training center within Weapons Training Center, devoted to train weapons training officers of fleet squadrons. The Chief of Naval Operations recognized the need for postgraduate weapons training and expressed a desire to create a new command and the Weapons Training Center was transferred to the program and it was redesignated to Strike Fighter Weapons School Pacific on July 1, 1988. Strike Fighter Weapons School Atlantic SFWSP is mirrored on the East Coast as Strike Fighter Weapons School Atlantic (SFWSL). In the 1960s, as new weapons were introduced to the fleet, aircrews and ordnance personnel needed training on loading and delivery of these weapons. Training was provided when Conventional Weapons School was formed as a department of Readiness Attack Carrier Air Wing (RCVW-4). Its mission was to provide training for A-4 Skyhawk/A-7 Corsair aircraft. Eventually RCVW-4 became CLAW-1, of which the weapons school became a department based at NAS Cecil Field. On May 4, 1987 Light Attack Weapons School Atlantic, (LAWSLant) was designated a shore command, providing training for navy light attack aircraft. On May 1, 1988, the name was changed to Strike Fighter Weapons School, Atlantic, in order to coincide with the transition to the F/A-18 Hornet and its dual mission capabilities. In 1999 SFWSL moved from NAS Cecil Field to NAS Oceana and is now part of Strike Fighter Wing Atlantic. On March 22, 2002, the F-14 Weapons School, Strike Weapons & Tactics School (SWATSLANT), was consolidated with SFWSL as part of the transition from the F-14 Tomcat to the F/A-18 Super Hornet. This allowed a synergistic approach to the training of the strike fighter community. Training and responsibilities Both the East and West coast Weapons Schools are responsible for Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) which is the first part of the Fighter Advanced Training Program (FTARP). Aircrews spend two weeks at their home station attending 18 lectures on aircraft weapons systems, tactics and F/A-18 employment from Strike Fighter Tactics Instructors (SFTI) assigned to the respective school. After completion of these lectures, aircrews spend another week flying the first five of 15 flights in the SFARP syllabus before heading to NAS Fallon, there they draw experience of the SFTIs and use Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center ranges and adversaries to hone their skills to be used in future combat operations. Both schools are also responsible for training of Forward Air Controllers (Airborne), after completion of the Tactical Air Control Party course, F/A-18F aircrews receive 17 lectures and nine flights provided by the FAC(A) instructors at the weapons school, after completion of the training, the FAC(A)s are able to coordinate weapons employment in support of close-air-support missions with friendly troops. SFWSP/L instructors regularly fly with local squadrons and host various conferences at their respective facilities while not at Fallon, many flights are part of Strike Fighter Weapons and Tactics (SFWT) program which is a syllabus for employing the F/A-18 in combat, all F/A-18 aircrews take part in SFWT, SFWSP/L instructors teaches safe and sound execution of section and division tactics in accordance with the latest recommendations from TOPGUN. SFWSL is staffed with 25 permanently assigned officers and 26 enlisted personnel and seven civilians.

Deok- chil perfectly resembles the prince, so Choong-nyung instantly grabs the chance to disguise himself as a slave and they exchange clothes with each other. In a terrible twist of fate, when Choong-nyung wakes up after being knocked unconscious, he is mistaken for a slave and Deok-chil gets put on the throne. As Choong-nyung ventures outside the palace walls, he begins to open his eyes to the people living in extreme poverty and experiences the life of the common man.

It is based on a Spanish song popular at that time. It lasts approximately 8‚Äì9 minutes according to the high tempo Liszt assigned, though most pianists play it slower (10‚Äì12 minutes) due to its incredible difficulty. Overview Liszt's piano piece was based on Manuel Garcia's popular aria \\"Yo que soy contrabandista\\" for soprano female singer, guitar, and castanets, from his one-act zarzuela El poeta calculista. The song was made popular by Garc√≠a's daughter, the well-known mezzo-soprano Maria Malibran. Liszt's piece is essentially a set of variations on the song, loosely organized in rondo form. As with Liszt's other piano works based on other composers' pieces, it contains a complete exploration of the elements of the theme. After each excursion the theme keeps coming back around as in a typical rondo. It has been hailed as one of the most technically challenging solo piano compositions in classical pianism. It contains a great quantity of effects and virtuoso feats, including chord tremolos with accompanying thirds, wide jumps, fast repetitive notes, and arpeggios and octaves at a breakneck tempo, keeping a deciso (decisive) attitude throughout. Compared to La campanella's infamous two-to-three octave jumps, the Rondeau's leaps are two octaves greater. Liszt initially intended this piece as a bravura finale for his recitals, but hardly ever played it.Leslie Howard on Liszt, 1997. He performed it in front of George Sand who praised it and wrote extensively about it, and Hector Berlioz hailed it as Liszt's finest work. The modern concert pianist Mikhail Pletnev was eager to play it live, but gave up, calling it \\"unplayable\\". Valentina Lisitsa has performed and recorded her interpretation on YouTube (in 2011), including an impromptu performance on a public upright piano in London's St. Pancras railway station in 2013. Leslie Howard played the piece at a festival of Spanish music in Madrid in 2015, having recorded it 19 years earlier as part of his complete survey of Liszt's works for solo piano.Liszt: Complete Piano Music, Leslie Howard (piano), Hyperion Records References External links * Category:Compositions by Franz Liszt Category:Compositions for solo piano Category:1836 compositions ","title":"Rondeau fantastique sur un th√®me espagnol"},{"id":"34420544","text":"Global Poetry was founded as a project in the year 2000 to bring together poets from common people around the world with a view to exhibiting poetry that can inspire grassroots change at individual level, and to also bring together poetry that would become a force for social change.

Career Bache was the commander of a detachment of 351 men in the Pennsylvania State Militia Volunteers which was assigned by Pennsylvania Governor Simon Snyder to defend the City of Philadelphia against the British in the War of 1812. In October 1814, Lt. Col. Bache refused to submit to federal military takeover of his Pennsylvania State Militia detachment because his soldiers originally joined the state militia pursuant to a later-disputed agreement with U.S. Brigadier General Joseph Bloomfield that Bache's soldiers would always serve under their state (and not federal) militia officers. Standing firm on principle, Bache and his five subordinate officers were arrested. Bache was court-martialed and was dismissed from U.S. military service. The military court decided not to punish Bache further because the court believed Bache's closing arguments... that he acted in good faith based upon Governor Snyder's orders, his motives were pure, and that trust was placed in him by his soldiers and the soldiers' parents who allowed their sons to volunteer only under the command of trusted state militia officers.

Plot The novel is about twins Matt and Emily (\\"Em\\") Calder who share an ability that allows them to make artwork come to life, due to their powerful imaginations. Their ability is sought after by antagonists who wish to use it in order to breach Hollow Earth‚Äîa realm in which all demons and monsters are trapped.

Part of the novel is set on the fictitious island of Auchinmurn, which is inspired by the islands of Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae off the coast of Largs. The name Auchinmurn is a tribute to Carole and John's maternal grandmother Murn Butler. Other locations which feature in the novel include Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and the \\"Pencil\\" Monument near Largs. Since Art and artwork is an important theme in the novel, many of the paintings mentioned are based on or inspired by real-life works of art from artists such as Georges Seurat, William Blake, Vincent van Gogh, Henry Fuseli and Salvador Dal√≠. The name of the female protagonist 'Emily' was chosen for being the middle name of author Carole Barrowman and also the Christian name of the Barrowmans' paternal Grandmother, Emily Barrowman. The name of male protagonist, 'Matt', was chosen because it is John Barrowman's favourite male Christian name. Reception The book has been described by Sarah Swain of The Herald as a Scottish-style version of Harry Potter.

He gained fame through his self-immolation, an act of protest against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Biography Mark David Ritscher was born in Dickinson, North Dakota on January 13, 1954. Ritscher and his family moved around the United States until 1969, when they moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he attended high school. Ritscher married at age 17, had a son named Malachi, and after almost ten years, divorced. In 1981 Ritscher moved to Chicago and adopted the name Malachi for himself. He played bass on a 1988 EP by Arsenal, a recording project of Big Black guitarist Santiago Durango. (The credit on the EP reads \\"Malachi Richter\\".) In the 1990s he became a fixture on Chicago's jazz and experimental music scenes, attending and recording many performances. Ritscher, after recording a live concert, would offer his high- quality recording to the musicians at little or no cost. Many of these recordings have seen official release.Malachi Ritscher allmusic.com Near the end of his life Ritscher traveled extensively. He also developed a strong commitment to anti-war issues; Chicago police arrested him twice at anti-war protests.  Suicide  Ritscher's self-immolation took place on the side of the Kennedy Expressway near downtown Chicago during the morning rush hour of Friday November 3, 2006. In a suicide letter published on his website, he described at length his political convictions as to the Iraq War and his choice to take his own life, writing, \\"if I am required to pay for your barbaric war, I choose not to live in your world.\\"mission statement Reaction to death Ritscher's self-immolation went unremarked by the media for nearly a week.War Protestor's Public Suicide in Chicago Went Unnoticed by Media It was condemned by Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper, who thought that his suicide was a pointless act. \\"With all great respect, if he thought setting himself on fire and ending his life in Chicago would change anyone's mind about the war in Iraq, his last gesture on this planet was his saddest and his most futile.\\"\\"Act by 'martyr' to protest war in Iraq a futile gesture\\", Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times, published November 9, 2006, accessed November 9, 2006. Ritscher's son described his father as a recovering alcoholic who fought with depression. Other members of Ritscher's family instead believed that Ritscher killed himself to shock an apathetic public into action against the war and world oppression.\\"\\"Activist's Fiery Death Prompts Questions\\" , Ashley M. Heher, Associated Press, published November 26, 2006, accessed January 17, 2011. Ritscher himself gave detailed reasons for his suicide: \\"My position is that I only get one death, I want it to be a good one. Wouldn't it be better to stand for something or make a statement, rather than a fiery collision with some drunk driver? Are not smokers choosing death by lung cancer? Where is the dignity there? Are not the people who disregard the environment killing themselves and future generations?\\" In his self-penned obituary he confessed to feeling guilty for not killing Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld when he had the chance.Gallery99 Ska-punk band Less Than Jake wrote a song about Ritscher's death titled \\"Malachi Richter's Liquor's Quicker\\" for their 2008 album GNV FLA. Ritscher's name was intentionally misspelled as Richter in reference to his credit on the 1988 Arsenal EP he'd played bass on which his name had been similarly misspelled. The opening of the song includes the reading of an excerpt from his suicide note with Morse code underneath that says \\"We may lose hope but there‚Äôs always hope.\\"\\"Interviews: Vinnie Fiorello (Less Than Jake).\\" Punknews.org. August 25, 2008. David Lester, guitarist in Mecca Normal, designed a poster of Malachi as one of his Inspired Agitator series in 2008. Mecca Normal recorded a song in 2010 called \\"Malachi\\" for a 7\\" on K Records. The song was engineered by Calvin Johnson. The section \\"Objection: 'Compositions/Improvisations'\\" in the 2011 book Howell by poet Tyrone Williams features poems whose titles are also the titles of live jazz albums recorded by Ritscher, and is dedicated to Ritscher. The section also quotes Ritscher's suicide note in full, and mentions Thich Quang Duc.

Motivation  In the complex case, algebraic geometry begins by defining the complex affine space to be \\\\Complex^n. For each U\\\\subset\\\\Complex^n, we define \\\\mathcal{O}_U, the ring of analytic functions on U to be the ring of holomorphic functions, i.e. functions on U that can be written as a convergent power series in a neighborhood of each point. We then define a local model space for f_{1}, \\\\ldots, f_{n}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O}_U to be :X:=\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in U:f_{1}(x)= \\\\cdots =f_{n}(x)=0\\\\\\\\} with \\\\mathcal{O}_X=\\\\mathcal{O}_U/(f_{1}, \\\\ldots,f_{n}). A complex analytic space is a locally ringed \\\\Complex-space (Y, \\\\mathcal{O}_Y) which is locally isomorphic to a local model space. When k is a complete non-Archimedean field, we have that k is totally disconnected. In such a case, if we continue with the same definition as in the complex case, we wouldn't get a good analytic theory. Berkovich gave a definition which gives nice analytic spaces over such k, and also gives back the usual definition over \\\\Complex. In addition to defining analytic functions over non-Archimedean fields, Berkovich spaces also have a nice underlying topological space. Berkovich spectrum A seminorm on a ring A is a non-constant function |\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!|: A \\\\to \\\\R_{\\\\geq 0} such that :\\\\begin{align} |0|&=0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ |1|&=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ |f+g&\\\\leqslant |f|+|g\\\\\\\\\\\\ |fg&\\\\leqslant |f||g\\\\end{align} for all f, g \\\\in A. It is called multiplicative if |fg=|f||gand is called a norm if |f= 0 implies f = 0. If A is a normed ring with norm \\\\|\\\\\\\\!-\\\\\\\\!\\\\then the Berkovich spectrum of A, denoted \\\\mathcal{M}(A), is the set of multiplicative seminorms on A that are bounded by the norm of A. The Berkovich spectrum is equipped with the weakest topology such that for any f \\\\in A the map :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\varphi_{f}:\\\\mathcal{M}(A)\\\\to\\\\R \\\\\\\\\\\\ |\\\\cdot\\\\mapsto |f\\\\end{cases} is continuous. The Berkovich spectrum of a normed ring A is non-empty if A is non-zero and is compact if A is complete. If x is a point of the spectrum of A then the elements f with |f|_x = 0 form a prime ideal of A. The quotient field of the quotient by this prime ideal is a normed field, whose completion is a complete field with a multiplicative norm; this field is denoted by \\\\mathcal{H}(x) and the image of an element f\\\\in A is denoted by f(x). The field \\\\mathcal{H}(x) is generated by the image of A. Conversely a bounded map from A to a complete normed field with a multiplicative norm that is generated by the image of A gives a point in the spectrum of A. The spectral radius of f, :\\\\rho(f)=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left \\\\|f^n \\\\right \\\\|^{\\\\frac{1}{n}} is equal to :\\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{M}(A)}|f|_{x}. Examples * The spectrum of a field complete with respect to a valuation is a single point corresponding to its valuation. * If A is a commutative C*-algebra then the Berkovich spectrum is the same as the Gelfand spectrum. A point of the Gelfand spectrum is essentially a homomorphism to \\\\Complex, and its absolute value is the corresponding seminorm in the Berkovich spectrum. * Ostrowski's theorem shows that the Berkovich spectrum of the integers (with the usual norm) consists of the powers f|^{\\\\varepsilon}_{p} of the usual valuation, for p a prime or \\\\infty. If p is a prime then 0\\\\leqslant\\\\varepsilon\\\\leqslant\\\\infty, and if p = \\\\infty then 0\\\\leqslant\\\\varepsilon\\\\leqslant 1. When \\\\varepsilon =0 these all coincide with the trivial valuation that is 1 on all non-zero elements. For each p (prime or infinity) we get a branch which is homeomorphic to a real interval, the branches meet at the point corresponding to the trivial valuation. The open neighborhoods of the trivial valuations are such that they contain all but finitely many branches, and their intersection with each branch is open.  Berkovich affine space  If k is a field with a valuation, then the n-dimensional Berkovich affine space over k, denoted \\\\mathbb{A}^n_k, is the set of multiplicative seminorms on k[x_1, \\\\ldots,x_n] extending the norm on k. The Berkovich affine space is equipped with the weakest topology such that for any f\\\\in k the map \\\\varphi_{f}: \\\\mathbb{A}^n \\\\to\\\\R taking |\\\\cdot|\\\\in\\\\mathbb{A}^n to fis continuous. This is not a Berkovich spectrum, but is an increasing union of the Berkovich spectrums of rings of power series that converge in some ball (so it is locally compact). We define an analytic function on an open subset U\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{A}^{n} is a map :f:U\\\\to\\\\prod_{x\\\\in U}\\\\mathcal{H}(x) with f(x)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}(x) which is a local limit of rational functions, i.e., such that every point x\\\\in U has an open neighborhood U'\\\\subset U with the following property: : \\\\forall \\\\varepsilon > 0\\\\,\\\\exist g, h \\\\in\\\\mathcal{k}[x_{1}, \\\\ldots, x_{n}]: \\\\qquad \\\\forall x' \\\\in U' \\\\left( h(x') eq 0 \\\\ \\\\,\\\\land\\\\ \\\\left|f(x')-\\\\frac{g(x')}{h(x')}\\\\right< \\\\varepsilon \\\\right). Continuing with the same definitions as in the complex case, one can define the ring of analytic functions, local model space, and analytic spaces over any field with a valuation (one can also define similar objects over normed rings). This gives reasonable objects for fields complete with respect to a nontrivial valuation and the ring of integers \\\\Z. In the case where k=\\\\Complex, this will give the same objects as described in the motivation section. These analytic spaces are not all analytic spaces over non-Archimedean fields.  Berkovich affine line  The 1-dimensional Berkovich affine space is called the Berkovich affine line. When k algebraically closed non-Archimedean field, complete with respects to its valuation, one can describe all the points of the affine line. There is a canonical embedding k\\\\hookrightarrow\\\\mathbb{A}^1_k . The space \\\\mathbb{A}^{1} is a locally compact, Hausdorff, and uniquely path- connected topological space which contains k as a dense subspace. One can also define the Berkovich projective line \\\\mathbb{P}^{1} by adjoining to \\\\mathbb{A}^{1}, in a suitable manner, a point at infinity. The resulting space is a compact, Hausdorff, and uniquely path-connected topological space which contains \\\\mathbb{P}^{1}(k) as a dense subspace.

Bristol High Cross was a monumental market cross erected in 1373 in the centre of Bristol. It was built in Decorated Gothic style on the site of an earlier Anglo-Saxon cross, to commemorate the granting of a charter by Edward III to make Bristol a county, separate from Somerset and Gloucestershire. It was moved to the Stourhead Estate in 1765. Description Black and white sketch from c.1730 looking east from alt= The cross stood in the centre of the town, at the crossroads of its four main streets (). The base was four octagonal piers with cusped ogee arches. The next tier contained alcoves with statues of English monarchs. The top tier was a pinnacle with the actual cross as a finial. The material was oolitic limestone but, as this was susceptible to frost damage, it was subsequently painted in colours of blue, gold, red and vermilion. The vermilion was the predominant colour of the statues, being used for their dresses, and aged well.The cross is shown at the centre of Robert Ricart's map of Bristol, in the ms. The Maire of Bristowe is Kalendar. He was the common clerk of the town from 1478 to 1506, and his drawing was the first such plan of an English town. The base of the cross displayed statues of monarchs in alcoves. In 1663, the cross was rebuilt to add a third tier for four more statues and the total complement of eight was then:  Events  The cross's central location made it the natural place for special events. In 1399, supporters of Richard II were beheaded there by order of Henry Bolingbroke, after a short siege of Bristol. These included Richard's Lord High Treasurer, William le Scrope, Sir John Bussy and Sir Henry Green. The following year, Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester, was beheaded there for his part in the Epiphany Rising against Bolinbroke who was now King Henry IV. In 1487, it was the scene of ceremonies to greet Henry VII when he visited the city. In 1542, Bristol was proclaimed a bishopric at the cross. In 1554, Queen Mary and King Philip were there proclaimed joint sovereigns over England. In 1603, James I was proclaimed King of England by recorder George Snigge and the city dignitaries standing at the cross in their finery. Relocation Samuel Scott in about 1750. As Bristol prospered, the cross became an obstruction to traffic. In 1733 a nearby silversmith, John Vaughan, who occupied the building later known as the Dutch House, complained that the cross threatened his life and property whenever there was a high wind, and so persuaded the magistrates to have the cross taken down. The parts were stored in the guildhall until Alderman Price and other citizens arranged for it to be erected again in spring 1736 on College Green by the cathedral. It was there admired as a quaint antiquity but it only took thirty years for it once again to be thought an obstruction. This time, the complaints came from the visitors who had come to the spa of Hotwells. They were wont to promenade on the green in line abreast, and the cross impeded the great numbers so inclined ‚Äì lines of eight or more. A fund was collected to improve the green as a promenade but this was exhausted in raising the green. The cross was again removed in August 1762 and lay disassembled in the great cloister of the cathedral. In October 1764, Dean Cutts-Barton then gave it to Henry \\"the Magnificent\\" Hoare and the materials, except the very worn lower columns, were carted away to adorn his grand estate of Stourhead in Wiltshire. It remains there now in the care of the National Trust. Plaque describing the history of the Bristol Cross erected in Stourhead, Wiltshire, UK. Replica Charles Edward Hern in 1890.|thumb|left The Victorian citizens of Bristol sought to regain their cross but the original was now too fragile to be moved again. In 1851 they commissioned architect John Norton to build a replica which would again stand upon College Green. Norton inspected the original closely to copy its design and then engaged John Thomas, the celebrated mason and stone carver who had recently worked upon the new Palace of Westminster, to construct the body of the cross. The funds for the work were exhausted after only one statue had been completed‚ÄîEdward III‚Äîand so the replica stood for many years with the other alcoves remaining empty. The remaining statues were eventually installed in 1889, when the cross was moved from the apex to the centre of the green to make way for the statue of Queen Victoria, the statues having been commissioned from a prolific craftsman of the region, Harry Hems. The cross was taken down when College Green was lowered in 1950 and the upper stage of the replica cross re-erected in nearby Berkeley Square, where they were transferred in about 1956 from College Green.

In his British career he ran three times and won two races. His most significant win came when he overcame a leg injury to win the 1837 Epsom Derby. Phosphorus was later sold and exported to Brunswick, but was unable to reproduce his English form. He was unsuccessful as a stallion. Background Phosphorus, a bay horse with three white feet. Phosphorus' dam, the Rubens mare, an unnamed daughter of Rubens, had already produced one winner of the 1000 Guineas in May-day (1834) and went on to produce another one in Firebrand (1842). She was also the dam of the outstanding racemare Camarine. Phosphorus was a lightly built, unprepossessing horse; viewing him immediately after his win at Epsom, the Farmer's Magazine praised his trainer for the colt's excellent condition, but could find little to compliment in his appearance. The Sporting Magazine was even less flattering, describing Phosphorus as a \\"weak-looking little cripple\\". Racing career 1837: three-year-old season Phosphorus was unraced as a two-year-old and made his first racecourse appearance at Newmarket in April. Ridden by John Day, he finished second in the Newmarket Stakes, beaten by a length by Rat-trap. Day was also the jockey when Phosphorus returned to Newmarket in May against ten opponents in the Rowley Mile Plate. He started at odds of 5/2 and won easily by two lengths from an unnamed colt by Mulatto. Phosphorus was reported to be \\"in physic\\" at the time of this race, meaning that he was running under some kind of medication. Phosphorus was moved to a base at Epsom to complete his preparation for the Derby, but on his first gallop after arriving he sprained a foreleg. He was lame and confined to his box for four days, after which the soreness appeared to have faded although some swelling remained. By this time, however, Day had heard of the colt's problems and rejected him in favour of a colt named Wisdom as his ride in the race. On the morning of the Derby Phosphorus was walked for four hours and, having returned sound, was cleared by his owner to run, with the ride going to George Edwards. News of Phosphorus' problems led to his price for the Derby drifting, despite the fact that he had been \\"tipped\\" as a possible winner in a poem published in Bell's Life magazine which ended: :\\"Tis over, the trick for the thousands is done, :George Edwards on Phosphorus the Derby has won!\\" On 25 May Phosphorus started at odds of 40/1 in a field of seventeen runners for the Derby, with Rat-trap being made the 6/4 favourite. The 1837 race was the first to be started by flag and the last to be held on a Thursday: the Derby was almost always run on a Wednesday for the next 150 years. After a delay as the police cleared some of the 100,000 spectators from the course and several false starts, the race got under way with a colt named Pocket Hercules taking the lead, and Phosphorus racing in third. The pace was exceptionally fast and most of the runners were struggling well before the turn into the straight, by which point Phosphorus and the second favourite Caravan had moved up to dispute the lead. The two colts pulled clear of the rest of the runners and raced side-by-side throughout the closing stages in a \\"magnificent\\" contest. Inside the final furlong the outsider, under a strong ride from Edwards, gained the advantage and won by a margin variously reported as a head, a neck or half a length from Caravan, with the pair six lengths clear of the field. Phosphorus aggravated his injury in winning the Derby and was reported to be \\"dead lame\\" after the race. He did not run again that year and there were doubts that he could ever be returned to racing condition. 1838: four-year-old season Phosphorus was kept in training as a four-year-old, but the death of Lord Berners on 28 March rendered all of his remaining race entries void under the rules of racing at the time. At Newmarket in April, the Derby winner was put up for auction and sold for 910 guineas. Later that year, Phosphorus was sold privately for 1,000 guineas to the Duke of Brunswick and exported to Germany. He is known to have raced several times in Germany without success, but details of his later career are sketchy. He is reported to have been beaten \\"very easy\\" by a mare called My Lady in a race in Brunswick. Stud career Following his retirement, Phosphorus stood as a stallion in Germany. He appears to have made no impact at stud.

The episode first aired on NBC on 18 October 1985. It featured guest star Bruce McGill as an eccentric retired police officer attempting to aid Metro-Dade detectives James \\"Sonny\\" Crockett and Ricardo \\"Rico\\" Tubbs in the search for a missing drug lord. The episode was the second of four in the series directed by Jim Johnston, and was written by John Mankiewicz and Douglas Lloyd McIntosh based on a story idea by McIntosh and Joel Surnow. \\"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\\" was well-received critically, earning a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for editor Robert A. Daniels, and appearing in TV Guide's 1997 list of the \\"100 Greatest TV Episodes of All Time\\". Plot When James \\"Sonny\\" Crockett (Don Johnson) and Ricardo Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) arrest a small-scale drug dealer, they receive a visit at the police station from a man Crockett recognises as retired Vice officer Hank Weldon (Bruce McGill). Weldon informs the pair that the man they have arrested works for a drug lord called Tony Arcaro, who disappeared five years before after narrowly avoiding a conviction. Suspicious of Weldon's motives, and his seemingly unstable mental condition, Crockett and Tubbs visit his former police partner Marty Lang (David Strathairn), who informs them that Weldon was discharged on medical grounds rather than having retired. He had painstakingly built up a case against Arcaro and suffered a breakdown when the drug lord walked free on a technicality. When the pair go to leave, they find that Weldon has followed them, and is both defensive and furious concerning their visit to his partner. However, he reveals that Arcaro's successor, Freddie Constanza, is to be shot that day on Arcaro's orders. All three reach the location of the hit in time to witness Constanza being killed, and Weldon is arrested on suspicion of involvement. Weldon is later released uncharged, and acting on information he overheard from his cell-mate, tips off Crockett and Tubbs to the location of a drug deal involving Arcaro's men. When the deal is interrupted and Arcaro found to be absent, Weldon is enraged and storms off. That night, Weldon places a call to the police station claiming he has found Arcaro. When Crockett and Tubbs arrive at the scene, an abandoned tenement building, they find a disturbed but lucid Weldon, who begins to tear down a plaster wall. Immured inside the wall is the corpse of Tony Arcaro and a newspaper from the day of his acquittal. Weldon does not admit to having killed Arcaro in response to the court trial, while Lang later confesses to helping build the wall‚Äîto help his partner, flatly stating \\"He was my partner; you understand, you understand?\\" to Crockett, who confirms \\"Yeah\\", that he does... Production \\"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\\" was the second of four in the series directed by Jim Johnston, after his d√©but for the series with the first season episode \\"Nobody Lives Forever\\".; Johnson would also direct the later episodes \\"Trust Fund Pirates\\" and \\"Honor Among Thieves?\\". The episode was written by John Mankiewicz and Douglas Lloyd McIntosh based on a story idea by McIntosh and Joel Surnow. Although this would be McIntosh's only contribution to the series, Mankiewicz would write \\"Yankee Dollar\\" later in the same season, whilst Surnow would contribute a total of nine episodes over the series' run. As was customary for Miami Vice episodes, \\"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\\" made use of popular music. The opening scene features \\"Baba O'Riley\\" by The Who, whilst \\"Brothers in Arms\\" by Dire Straits plays during the climactic scene. Incidental music by series composer Jan Hammer is used for the remainder of the episode's score. Guest star Bruce McGill was cast only days before production began, after Dennis Hopper, for whom the role was written, pulled out. McGill flew from New York to Miami during the middle of the night to arrive on time, and began reading the script without having slept for some time. He based his interpretation of the character on the idea that Weldon would use his odd behaviour as a defense mechanism when conversations did not go his way. McGill would later appear in several films directed by Miami Vice creator Michael Mann, including Collateral, The Insider, and Ali. McGill credits his \\"flamboyant\\" performance as Weldon for these roles, as well as for his casting Jack Dalton on MacGyver. Broadcast and reception \\"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\\" first aired on NBC on October 18, 1985. and has been well-received critically. The episode earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for editor Robert A. Daniels. The episode also appeared in TV Guide's 1997 list of the \\"100 Greatest TV Episodes of All Time\\". McGill's performance has also been praised as \\"virtuoso\\" and \\"disturbing\\". Emily VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, felt that the episode replaced the \\"goofiness\\" of contemporary police dramas with \\"cold, dark cynicism\\", finding that the episode's dark ending \\"set a new standard for TV direction\\". DVD Verdict's Judge Ryan Keefer reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B+ and praising McGill's acting. The episode has also been examined in Stephen Sanders' book Miami Vice. The author describes the episode as tackling \\"a nearly ubiquitous noir theme\\", namely \\"the appearance of the past in the present\\". Sanders also described McGill's character Weldon as \\"lost in a noir void, neither redeemed nor justified\\".

It is part of the Chontalapa region in the north center of the state and a major center of Tabasco's Chontal Maya population. Although the local economy is still based on agriculture and livestock, oil production, handcrafts and some tourism are important aspects as well. The environment of the area is low-lying flat land susceptible to flooding including being hard hit by the 2007 Tabasco flood and more recent flooding in 2011. The city The city of Nacajuca is located in the north of the state of Tabasco, Mexico, in the Chontalpa Region, 26 km from the state capital of Villahermosa. It is the seat for the municipality of the same name with all governmental functions thereof. It also is the location for most state and federal buildings and services as well. Its main economic activities are commerce and agriculture. It has a population of about 8,200 people. The Parque Central Miguel Hidalgo (Miguel Hidalgo Central Park) marks the historic center of the city and is the site of most of its civic, cultural and recreational events. It has a modest kiosk in the center with a monument to Miguel Hidalgo in the southwest corner. It has walkways, garden areas with fig and coconut trees. The San Antonio de Padua Temple is located facing the Hidalgo Park. The current construction dates to 1965 in mostly Gothic style. The main facade has three levels with a triangular crest. The facade is flanked by two towers with four levels and a spire decorated with doves, which support a metallic cross. The facade has pointed arches with three entrances, windows on the second level of the portal and the third and fourth levels of the towers. The third level of the portal has a rose window as well as the second level of the towers. Another is found on the north tower which the south tower has a clock. The interior has a basilica layout with the central nave higher than the side ones. This permits illumination from the windows in the center as well as the side windows. History The name comes from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúplace of pale or discolored faces.‚Äù This name was given to the area by the Aztecs, who notice the pale complexion of most of the people here due to then prevalent malaria. The municipality's seal was created in 1998. It contains images related to the area's Chontal population, its wetlands environment with a snail speaking in the center. Underneath is the world ‚ÄúYIXTUP‚Äù which is its name in the Chontal language along with a legend that reads ‚ÄúPeople first, things after.‚Äù The first culture to dominate the Nacajuca area was Mayan coming from what is now Chiapas and Guatemala, eventually establishing the main city in nearby Comalcalco. The settlements of the municipality have long histories with their names originally spelled Nacaxuxuca, T√∫cta, Mazateupa, Tapaucingo, Huatacalca, Tecoluta, Huaitalpa, Olcuatitlan and Ohicake. The first Spanish arrived to the area in 1518 making contact with the Chontales here and other parts of the state of Tabasco. In 1524 and 1525, Hern√°n Cort√©s passed through on his way to what is now Honduras and commented on the area's abundant cacao in his letters to the Spanish Crown. The area was also mentioned by contemporary historian Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, noticing that the local population had pale faces, generally due to the prevalence of malaria. In 1525, the Spanish Crown gifted a painting of the king to the village of Tucta in recognition of that community's alliance with the Spanish. Despite the early Spanish arrival, the area was not easily pacified, with Francisco de Montego trying and failing in 1528. However, the people of the village of Tucta eventually allied with the Spanish. The area was completely under Spanish control by 1550. After this year, the Spanish began to infiltrate and live in the villages of the municipality to established encomiendas and haciendas for the production of cacao and fruit. In 1579, Melchor Alfaro of Nacajuca created a map and diary of Tabasco to be sent to the Spanish Crown. The first church and first royal treasury of Tabasco was built in the town in 1614. By 1665, the community's name was modified to Nacajuca and was the governmental authority for thirteen other communities. By 1843, the town was known as San Pedro Nacajuca. In 1844, volunteer companies were created headed by Manuel Antonio Le√≥n, Francisco de Sentmanat y Sayas and Manuel Plasencia to fight off foreign invasion. In 1852, the municipality was composed of the town of Nacajuca as seat along with the communities of, Mazateupa, Tapotzingo, Guatacalca, Tecoluta, Guaytalpa, Olcuatit√°n, Oxiacaque along with the farmland among them. In 1863, Nacajuca was officially declared a town. Telephone service began in the area in 1896, with an official office in the town. In 1906, a railroad linking the town with Cunduac√°n and Comalcalco was built. In 1971, it was declared a city. Chontal Maya Nacajuca is a major center of the state's Chontal Maya population, which principally live in the north-center of Tabasco. They call themselves ‚Äúyoko yinikob‚Äù and ‚Äúyoko ixikob‚Äù which mean true men and true women respectively. The name Chontal comes from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúforeigner‚Äù originally how the Aztecs called them. Their language is of the Mayan family, which is descended from a language spoken in southeastern Mexico four thousand years ago. It belongs to the Ch‚Äôol subgroup and further divides today into several mutually intelligible dialects. There are three main dialects, North, South and Tapotzingo, with North and Tapotzingo centered on the Nacajuca area. The number of speakers of Chontal Maya have been increasing since 1980 with about 60% of the ethnic population able to speak it at least somewhat. These speakers are almost always bilingual. One reason for this is the introduction of bilingual education in the 1970s. According to the 2010 government census, there are 13,809 speakers of an indigenous language, and almost all indigenous language speakers (over 96%) are speakers of Chontal Maya. However, government census data, which only counts the number of Chontal speakers over the age of five, does not accurately reflect the size of the Chontal community. In 2000, the size of the ethnic Chontal Maya community was estimated at 36.9% of the total. Fourteen of the municipality's communities are considered to be primarily indigenous, another four predominantly indigenous and six with a large indigenous population. Those without strong indigenous presence number 38. Communities with a strong Chontal Maya presence include Tucta, Tapotzingo, Mazateupa, Guaytalpa, Tecoluta, Oxiacaque, Guatacalca, Olcuatit√°n, San Isidro, San Sim√≥n, El Sitio, Isla Guadalupe, El Tigre, Guanosolo and Saloya. Geography and environment The territory is flat with an elevation of about ten meters above sea level. There are no notable hills. Its low terrain makes it very vulnerable to flooding. During the 2007 floods, which affected 80% of the state with a million people affected, the city of Nacajuca and other communities on higher ground became affected. With roads washed out, small boats were used. This flood affected the entire municipality and destroyed or damaged many of the homes. Flooding from the Samaria River affected Chontal communities such as Gu√°cimo, Pastal, Chcozapote, Guatacalca and Oxiacaque in the municipality in October 2011. Residents here blame the flood on discharge from the Pe√±itas Dam. Twenty five percent of the state's fresh water passes through the municipality. It has a large amount of surface water in the form of rivers, streams and lakes. The most important rivers include Carrizal, Samaria, Cunduac√°n, Nacajuca, Gonz√°lez, Calzada, San Cipriano and Jahuactal, and the important lakes are Cantem√≥, La Ramada, Desag√ºe and Puct√©. The climate is hot and humid with abundant rain year round, especially in the summer. The average annual temperature is 26.4C. Highest temperatures occur in May with an average of 30.8C and low temperatures generally occur in January with an average of 22.4C. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded are 44C and 12C respectively. Average annual rainfall for the area is 1707.2mm with September accounting for most of the precipitation at an average of 735.8mm. The driest month is April with 251.2mm. Average annual relative humidity ranges from 78% in May and June to 85% in January and February. The windiest months are November and December with speeds of up to 32 km/hr. In June and July, average wind speed is 20 km/hr. The dominant ecosystem in the municipality is wetland with a wide variety of flora and fauna. However, this ecosystem has been badly degraded by overexploitation. In addition, there are some areas with lakes, grassland and forests. The little forest area has also been seriously threatened by over ‚Äìlogging for tropical hardwoods and clearing for pasture. The main fauna of the area include rabbits, opossums, armadillos, caiman crocodiles, pejelagarto, coral snakes, iguanas and more, all of which are considered threatened. Culture The municipality's culture is strongly influenced by the Chontal Maya population especially in religious traditions which are a syncretism of Catholic and indigenous rituals. The village of Olcuatitl√°n is noted for its Candlemas celebration in early February masses, dances and fireworks. Another aspect is the use of leafy tree branches used as offerings to religious images in the hope for good crops and livestock production for the coming year. Traditional dress for women consists of a long, full flowered skirt and a white cotton blouse embroidered around the neck. For men, it consists of white cotton pants and shirt with a red handkerchief around the neck with a hat called ‚Äúchontal‚Äù, carrying back and machete. Traditional foodstuffs include a plant called guao (Comocladia dentate), turtle, pejelagarto and other river fish and turkey. Traditional sweets are made from coconut, papaya, lemons, mangos, prunes and a type of yam (camote). The most traditional drink is pozol, made from chocolate and corn, along with hot chocolate and fruit drinks. The community of Saloya is known for its palapa type restaurants specializing in regional dishes and seafood. Socioeconomics Considered to have a low level of economic marginalization. As of 2010, the number of homes in the municipality was 19,670, 29,029 residences as of 2010 up from 19,670 in 2005, most of which were owned by their occupants. Most homes in the municipality (just under 90%) have cement foundations, brick or block walls and asbestos or zinc laminate roofs. Just under 72% have running water, about 83% have sewerage and about 93% have electricity. Most homes have between 2 and seven occupants with an average of about five. The municipality has a surface of 48,837 hectares. Five percent of this is used for agriculture, 43% is for livestock, 48% is forest or other wild areas and the rest is developed or not considered productive. Major crops are corn and beans both principally produced for auto-consumption. Livestock is practiced extensively in the municipality mostly cattle with some pigs, horses and domestic fowl. Since the 1970s, there have been efforts to form artificial land in lake areas for cultivation and aquaculture. The artificial land is called ‚Äúcamellones Chontales‚Äù and is similar to Aztec chinampas. One difference is that these ‚Äúcamellones‚Äù are formed to a large extent from cacao pods. Despite the fish farming which does occur among thirty cooperatives and eighteen ejido organizations, most fishing is still for auto-consumption. The main natural resource for the municipality is petroleum which is managed by the state-owned oil company PEMEX. It has twenty three wells in the area in two fields called Sen and Mecoac√°n. The two fields produce over nineteen million barrels of oil and over 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year. The arrival of oil exploration in the area in the 1980s led to a rise in construction and some service industries in the area. The Chontal Maya especially became employed in construction. Many became drawn to outside employment as agriculture no longer provided sufficient living. Most other industry is from family concerns and small workshops making furniture, piloncillo, brooms, bread and decorating clothing. Reed craft is also important making mats, hats and carrying bags. Leatherwork generally consists of belts and saddles. There are also some ceramic making. Development of the commerce sector is slow to stagnant due to the lack of infrastructure. Most establishments sell basic goods such as foodstuffs. However, there are banks, restaurants, gas stations, auto parts, and supermarkets. The municipality has three traditional public markets, one in the municipal seat, one in the Limitas Ejido and one in Bosques de Saloya. There is one tianguis market. These serve about 94% of the municipality's population. The main tourist attraction of the area is the handcraft workshops in Olcuatit√°n, Mazateupa and Tapotzingo, along with the municipality's colorful churches with Chontal influence. The Arroyo Ranch, five km from the city of Nacajuca, creates dresses, blouses, shirts, tablecloths and napkins, all with colorful embroidery mostly on the borders. These are particularly prevalent on traditional women's dress with colors such as red, green, yellow, orange, blue and brown over a black background. The borders often contain images such as flower, animals, fruit and even landscapes.

Construction Building plans and funding plans were obtained in 1924 and construction of the hotel began the same year, before a hiatus due to financing problems. Construction was completed in 1927. History The hotel operated seasonally until 1961 when it became home to Trinity College. In 1988, Trinity College moved to Pasco County. In 1991, Schiller International University purchased the property and kept it until 2005. The Tampa Bay Times called the hotel building Dunedin's \\"most historically valuable structure\\". Herman Everett Wendell, who also designed the Suwannee Hotel in St. Petersburg, Florida was the building's architect. The 110-room hotel was home to radio station WGHB, the first in Pinellas County, which began broadcasting in 1925. The station was named after developer George H. Bowes, and was the precursor to WFLA. Guests included Harley M. Kilgore, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, Stephen Early, Alfred M. Landon, Charles Kettering, Clarence Darrow, Alanson B. Houghton, James H. McGill and J.M. Donaldson. Robert A. Bartlett, an arctic explorer, stayed at the hotel and presented a talk on his journeys. As a private club in the 1950s, the hotel hosted an exclusive clientele of mostly Northerners during the winter months, changing owners in 1956 when it was bought for $300,000. Restoration Plans to restore the hotel and add two independent wings to the building, creating \\"a hotel with 132 rooms, a spa, a ballroom and a 150-seat restaurant, all surrounded by lush landscaping and a 6-foot-tall masonry wall\\", developed in 2007, raising traffic concerns from some residents. An earlier plan for a larger redevelopment was rejected. Redevelopment of the Jazz Age hotel stalled in 2010 over legal disputes and a foreclosure proceeding. On June 13, 2014, the non-profit organization, Taoist Tai Chi Society of the USA purchased the hotel for $2.8M to become its new national headquarters and a new international centre for its parent society, the Fung Loy Kok Institute of Taoism. The Society had proposed a two-phase development, renovation and restoration of the hotel building and grounds to suit the Society\`s purposes, then construction of 27 three-story town homes behind the hotel on the landward half of the 5.2 acre property, but later withdrew the town homes phase. The amended development proposal was approved by the Dunedin City Commission on March 5, 2015. Later, the Tai Chi Society decided based on public opinion that they would revise the plans of how much space they would occupy. The final decision that was made stated that over 100 rooms would be used for a public hotel under the Marriott International Autograph Collection Hotels brand to preserve the building mainly as a hotel. A rooftop terrace and bar will also be incorporated with the plans to create a lively new addition to Dunedin. Cottage Fenway cottage at sunset Fenway Cottage was built as part of the Fenway Hotel in Dunedin, Florida. Located adjacent to and south of the hotel, the cottage was built in 1938. A waterview property, the cottage faces the Saint Joseph Sound and the Intercoastal Waterway. Caledesi Island and Clearwater Beach skyline may be seen in the distance. Seasonal rental of the cottage was common. Seasonal guests include Samuel H. Kress (1944, 1945, 1946) who started the S. H. Kress & Co chain of retail stores and James H McGill (1941), founder of McGill Manufacturing Co. of Valpariso, Indiana. The cottage was acquired by Mainsail in 2016, previous owners include former Dunedin City Manager Richard A. Sexton who lived there until his death in 1969 and insurance executive Dennis Andersen. The house has 5 bedrooms and 4.5 baths. There are three bedrooms on the first floor; each bedroom has a private bath. Servants quarters were located on the second floor where there are two bedrooms and a shared bathroom. Call buttons are located in each bedroom and throughout the house which are connected to an annunciator panel in the kitchen. The call buttons would be used to summon the servants. Fenway Cottage is adjacent to the Head Office of the Taoist Tai Chi Society of the USA (housed in the old Fenway Hotel), a block from the Pinellas Trail, and two blocks from Dunedin Stadium, the Spring Training home of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team, as well as their minor league affiliate, the Dunedin Blue Jays. John Grant Hubbard Park, a linear park, runs along Edgewater Drive by the water in front of the property.

The novel tells the story of a young Pakistani-American boy growing up in the American Midwest and his struggle with his identity and religion. The novel has been published in English, Italian (La donna che mi insegn√≤ il respiro), Norwegian (Begynnelsen p√• et farvel), Dutch (De hemelverdiener),Ayad Akhtar - De hemelverdiener nu.nl/boek Het laatste nieuws het eerst op nu.nl Danish (Tavshedens smerte) and Spanish (El aroma secreto del lim√≥n y las especias). The book will be released in 17 more languages by the end of 2012. Background Author Ayad Akthar was raised in the Brookfield suburb of Milwaukee like his main character Hayat. As an adult, he often wondered how the lives of the women he had known in his childhood were affected by their faith. He decided to explore the idea through the novel: \\"My sense of the polarities at play for the Muslim women I saw in my childhood is a good part of what makes up the central story of American Dervish. In it, the brilliant and beautiful Mina Ali emigrates to America to rebuild her life after a terrible marriage and ugly divorce back in Pakistan. In America, living with her best friend‚Äôs family, she transforms the lives of all she encounters. She is imbued with a spiritual force, the book‚Äôs most powerful and inspiring agent of change. And yet she is a paradox: deeply devout, bound by her tradition, subject‚Äîin tragic ways‚Äîto a patriarchal order with which she struggles. In my novel, this is an unresolved tension, and one that I believe reflects a much larger picture, and one in which not only Muslims find themselves today.\\" Inspired by authors like Herman Melville and Toni Morrison who use biblical references in their novels, he included passages from the Quran in his text. Akhtar finished the novel in 2010 and sent it to various publishing companies. Little, Brown and Company bought the manuscript for a six-figure sum the day after they received it. Plot summary Hayat Shah, a young Pakistani American, lives in a boring suburb of Milwaukee with his unhappily married parents who are secular Muslims. His mother's best friend Mina and her son Imran come from Pakistan to stay with the family, escaping her ex-husband who threatens to take away Imran. Mina brightens the lives of the Shah family, becoming especially close with Hayat, telling him Sufi stories and teaching him the Quran. Hayat becomes obsessed with being a hafiz (someone who can recite the entire Quran from memory) after Mina tells him that the parents of hafiz are guaranteed a place in Paradise. Meanwhile, she meets Dr. Shah's best friend Nathan and falls in love with him. Nathan, who is Jewish, explores Islam and even expresses an interest in converting. Dr. Shah is an atheist and warns his best friend not to convert as he believes the local imam is only interested in money. When Hayat, Nathan and Dr. Shah go to the mosque to see the imam about Nathan converting, he preaches an anti-Semitic khutbah, devastating Nathan. Hayat is jealous when he realizes that Nathan and Mina are still planning on marrying. He sends a telegram to her ex-husband, revealing that Mina is marrying Nathan. Mina's family threatens to disown her if she marries him and Nathan moves away to Boston. Dr. Shah angrily forbids his son to read the Quran and burns Hayat's copy, although he secretly reads it at school in his effort to become a hafiz. Against the Shahs' objections, Mina decides to marry Sunil, a divorced Pakistani man from Kansas. During her wedding, Hayat discovers from Farhaz that true hafiz recite the Quran in Arabic while he has only been learning it in English. As a result, Hayat gives up on the Quran for many years. After her marriage Mina realizes that her new husband is controlling and abusive; he forces her to move back to Kansas with him. 8 years later when Mina is dying of cancer Hayat finally confesses to her that he sent the telegram. She forgives him and after she dies he sees Nathan and learns that the couple had been secretly keeping in contact. Characters * Hayat Shah, an American boy of Pakistani descent, naive and curious. * Dr. Naveed Shah, Hayat's father who is a doctor who does important MRI research. He is an atheist because of a difficult childhood with his abusive and ardently religious mother.

Major themes Identity, assimilation and Muslim life are the major themes in the novel. Hayat struggles with his identity as a Muslim while Mina, his father and his mother all have different ideas of what being Muslim means. Akhtar has spoken of his desire to write a book that would address the American religious experience, but from the point of view of a Muslim boy. Reception American Dervish received mainly positive reception from literary critics. The New York Times called it a \\"self-assured and effortlessly told\\" first novel. People called it \\"ambitious but accessible,\\" and gave it 3.5 stars out of 4, saying that the book brought \\"resonance to universal questions of belief and belonging\\" Rayyan Al-Shawaf, in The Brooklyn Rail, called the work \\"near-revolutionary,\\" characterizing it as an \\"unflinchingly conscientious examination of the fraught and much-manipulated subject of Muslim scripture.\\" However, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel compared the book unfavorably with James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Literary critics of Pakistani origin reviewed the book positively. Nazneen Sheikh, in Toronto's The Globe and Mail, called attention to the \\"faultless mimicry of the spoken language of a community of Pakistani immigrants in American suburbia.\\" Amina Elahi of Divanee called the book a \\"brutally honest account of Pakistani-American Muslim beliefs and hypocrisy.\\" References External links * Fresh Air interview with Ayad Akthar * Tavis Smiley interview with Ayad Akhtar * Time Magazine Article about American Dervish * Summary from Maclean's * Dallas Morning News review Category:American bildungsromans Category:2012 American novels Category:Novels set in the 1980s Category:Pakistani-American novels Category:Novels set in Milwaukee Category:Little, Brown and Company books Category:2012 debut novels ","title":"American Dervish"},{"id":"34421050","text":"Otsamo fell (Otsamotunturi in Finnish) is located in Inari, Finland.http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalhikingareas/inari/sights/Pages/Default.aspx The highest point of the fell is at above sea level.http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalhikingareas/inari/sights/Pages/Default.aspx The fell is situated about from the village of Inari.http://www.outdoors.fi/destinations/nationalhikingareas/inari/sights/Pages/Default.aspx There is a cabin on top of the fell that is free to use for hikers.http://www.outdoors.fi/Huts/lapland/northernlapland/otsamodaytriphut/Pages/Default.aspx Otsamo fell is popular hiking destination in Inari.

It was written by the Italian historian Carlo Ginzburg, then of the University of Bologna, and first published by the company Giulio Einaudi in 1966 under the Italian title of I Benandanti: Stregoneria e culti agrari tra Cinquecento e Seicento. It was later translated into English by John and Anne Tedeschi and published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in 1983 with a new foreword written by the historian Eric Hobsbawm. In The Night Battles, Ginzburg examines the trial accounts of those benandante who were interrogated and tried by the Roman Inquisition, using such accounts to elicit evidence for the beliefs and practices of the benandanti. These revolved around their nocturnal visionary journeys, during which they believed that their spirits traveled out of their bodies and into the countryside, where they would do battle with malevolent witches who threatened the local crops. Ginzburg goes on to examine how the Inquisition came to believe the benandanti to be witches themselves, and ultimately persecute them out of existence. Considering the benandanti to be \\"a fertility cult\\", Ginzburg draws parallels with similar visionary traditions found throughout the Alps and also from the Baltic, such as that of the Livonian werewolf, and also to the widespread folklore surrounding the Wild Hunt. He furthermore argues that these Late Medieval and Early Modern accounts represent surviving remnants of a pan-European, pre-Christian shamanistic belief concerning the fertility of the crops. Academic reviews of The Night Battles were mixed. Many reviewers argued that there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the benandanti represented a pre-Christian survival. Despite such criticism, Ginzburg would later return to the theories about a shamanistic substratum for his 1989 book Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath, and it would also be adopted by historians like √âva P√≥cs, Gab√≥r Klaniczay, Claude Lecouteux and Emma Wilby. Background The nocturnal visionary tradition of the benandanti led the Roman Inquisition to accuse them of being witches, malevolent Satanists depicted in this 1508 woodcut. In the Archepiscopal Archives of Udine, Ginzburg came across the 16th and 17th century trial records which documented the interrogation of several benandanti and other folk magicians. Historian John Martin of Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas would later characterize this lucky find as the sort of \\"discovery most historians only dream of.\\" Prior to Ginzburg's work, no scholars had investigated the benandanti, and those studies which had been made of Friulian folklore - by the likes of G. Marcotti, E. Fabris Bellavitis, V. Ostermann, A. Lazzarini and G. Vidossi - had all used the term \\"benandante\\" as if it had been synonymous with \\"witch\\". Ginzburg himself would note that this was not because of \\"neglect nor‚Ä¶ faulty analysis\\", but because in the recent oral history of the region, the two terms had become essentially synonymous.Ginzburg 1983. p. xxi. English translation The translation of The Night Battles into English was undertaken by John and Anne Tedeschi, a couple who had previously produced the English translation for Ginzburg's 1976 book The Cheese and the Worms: The Cosmos of a Sixteenth-Century Miller. In their Translator's Note to the English edition, they proclaimed that they were \\"very pleased\\" to have been given the opportunity to translate the book, opining that Ginzburg's two works \\"represent only a small part of the best of the new social, cultural and religious history being written today by a host of distinguished Italian scholars.\\" The Tedeschis went on to note that in translating The Night Battles, they had decided to adopt the Italian terms benandante and benandanti (singular and plural respectively) rather than trying to translate such terms into English. As they noted, a \\"literal translation\\" of these words would have been \\"those who go well\\" or \\"good- doers\\", terms which they felt did not capture the original resonance of benandanti. They also noted that in their translation they had used the term \\"witch\\" in the broader sense to refer to both males and females, but that when the Italian text specifically mentioned strega and stregone they rendered them as \\"witch\\" and \\"warlock\\".Tedeschi and Tedeschi 1983. pp. xi-xii. The English translation included a foreword by the prominent English historian Eric Hobsbawm (1917-2012), in which he argued that the \\"real interest in [Ginzburg's] extremely interesting book\\" lay not in its discussion of shamanistic visionary traditions, but in its study of how the Roman Catholic Church intervened in \\"traditional peasant practices\\" and warped them to fit their own ideas about witchcraft. He went on to note that The Night Battles should \\"fascinate and stimulate all historians of the popular mind.\\"Hobsbawm 1983. pp. ix-x. Synopsis The Night Battles is divided into four chapters, preceded by a preface written by Ginzburg, in which he discusses the various scholarly approaches that have been taken to studying Early Modern witchcraft, including the rationalist interpretation that emerged in the 18th century and the Witch-cult hypothesis presented by Margaret Murray. He proceeds to offer an introduction to the benandanti, and then thanks those who have helped him in producing his study.Ginzburg 1983. pp. xvii-xxii. Part I: The Night Battles The first part of The Night Battles deals primarily with the accounts of two benandante who were interrogated and sentenced for heresy by the Roman Inquisition between 1575 and 1582. These two figures, Paulo Gaspurotto of the village of Iassaco and Battista Moduco of the town of Cividale, first came under investigation from the priest Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza in 1575. Although Sgabarizza later abandoned his investigations, in 1580 the case was re-opened by the Inquisitor Fra Felice da Montefalco, who interrogated both Gaspurotto and Moduco until they admitted that they had been deceived by the Devil into going on their nocturnal spirit journeys. In 1581 they were sentenced to six months imprisonment for heresy, a punishment that was later remitted.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 1-14. Ginzburg then looks at Gaspurotto and Moduco's claims in greater detail, noting that the benandanti constituted \\"a true and proper sect\\" who were united by having been born with a caul.Ginzburg 1983. p. 15. He proceeds to examine the trances that the benandanti went into in order to go on their nocturnal spirit journeys, debating whether these visions could have been induced by the use of special psychoactive ointments or by epilepsy, ultimately arguing that neither offer a plausible explanation in light of the historical evidence at hand.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 16-20. Ginzburg looks at the agricultural elements to the benandanti's battles with their satanic opponents, arguing that their clashes represent an \\"agricultural rite\\" that symbolized the forces of famine fighting the forces of plenty. He suspected that this was a survival from an \\"older fertility rite\\" that had originated in pre-Christian Europe but which had subsequently been Christianized.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 22-26. He then goes on to examine the Early Modern accounts of aspects of popular belief across Europe that were similar to those of the benandanti. In particular he highlights the alleged cult of the goddess Diana that was recorded in late 15th century Modena and the case of the Livonian werewolf which occurred in 1692. Ginzburg ultimately argued that these scattered visionary traditions represented surviving elements of a pan-central European agrarian cult that had predated Christianization.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 27-32. Part II: The Processions of the Dead In the second part of The Night Battles, Ginzburg turns his attention toward those Early Modern Alpine traditions dealing with nocturnal processions of the dead. He initially discusses the interrogation of Anna la Rossa, a self-confessed spirit medium who was brought before the Roman Inquisition in Friuli in 1582, before detailing two similar cases that took place later that year, that of Donna Aquilina and Caterina la Guercia. The latter of these women claimed that her deceased husband had been a benandante, and that he had gone on a \\"procession with the dead\\", but none of them described themselves as being benandante.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 33-39. Ginzburg then looks at the Canon Episcopi, a 9th-century document that denounced those women who believed that they went on nocturnal processions with the goddess Diana; the Canon's author had claimed that they were deceived by the Devil, but Ginzburg argues that it reflects a genuine folk belief of the period. He connects this account with the many other European myths surrounding the Wild Hunt or Furious Horde, noting that in those in central Europe, the name of Diana was supplanted by that of Holda or Perchta. Ginzburg then highlights the 11th-century account produced by French Bishop William of Auvergne, in which he had described a folk belief surrounding a female divinity named Abundia or Satia, who in William's opinion was a disguised devil. According to William's account, this creature travelled through houses and cellars at night, accompanied by her followers, where they would eat or drink whatever they found; Ginzburg noted parallels with the benandanti belief that witches would drink all of the water in a house.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 40-41. Ginzburg highlights more evidence of the Wild Hunt folk motif in the Late Medieval accounts of the Dominican friar Johannes Nider. Nader related that certain women believed that they were transported to the conventicles of the goddess Herodias on the Ember Days, something which the monk attributed to the trickery of the Devil. Proceeding with his argument, Ginzburg describes an account by the chaplain Matthias von Kemnat, who recorded the persecution of a sect at Heidelberg circa 1475. According to Kemnat, this sect contained women who believed that they \\"travelled\\" during the Ember Days and cast non-fatal spells on men.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 42-43. Ginzburg then turns his attention to a work of the early 16th century, Die Emeis, written by the Swiss preacher Johann Geiler von Kaisersberg. In this account, Geiler refers to those people who went on nocturnal visits to see Fraw Fenus (Venus), including those women who fell into a swoon on the Ember Days, and who described a visit to Heaven after they had awoken.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 44-45. In further search of references to processions of the dead in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe, Ginzburg then highlights a 1489 trial of the weaver Giuliano Verdana held in Mantua and the 1525 trial of a woman named Wyprat Musin in Burseberg, in both of which the defendant claimed to have seen a procession of dead spirits led by a female figure.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 49-51. This is then followed by a discussion of the case of German herdsman Chonrad Stoecklin, who recounted visionary experiences in 1587 before being condemned as a witch.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 52-53. Following on from this, Ginzburg discussed the existence of clerici vagantes who were recorded as travelling around the Swabian countryside in 1544, performing folk magic and claiming that they could conjure the Furious Horde.Ginzburg 1983. p. 55. Ginzburg then discusses the case of Diel Breull, a German sorcerer who was tried in Hesse in 1630; Breull had claimed that on a visionary journey he encountered Fraw Holt, who revealed that he was a member of her nocturnal band.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 56-57. Ginzburg then makes comparisons between the benandanti and the Perchtenlaufen, an Alpine ceremony in which two masked groups of peasants battled one another with sticks, one dressed to appear ugly and the other to appear beautiful.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 57-58. Debating as to whether the traditions surrounding the processions of the dead originated in Germanic or Slavic Europe, Ginzburg then goes on to discuss the significance of the caul in benandanti belief.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 58-61. Part III: The Benandanti between Inquisitors and Witches In Part III, Ginzburg comments on how uninterested the Inquisition were in the benandanti between 1575 and 1619, noting that \\"The benandanti were ignored as long as possible. Their 'fantasies' remained enclosed within a world of material and emotional needs which inquisitors neither understood, nor even tried to understand.\\" He proceeds to discuss the few isolated incidents in which they did encounter and interact with the benandante during this period, opening with a discussion of the denunciation and arrest of self-professed benandanti Toffolo di Buri, a herdsman from the village of Pieris, that took place in 1583. This is followed by an exploration of the 1587 investigation into a midwife named Caterina Domenatta, who was accused of sorcery, and who admitted that both her father and dead husband had been benandante.Ginzburg 1983. pp. 69-73. From there, Ginzburg outlines a number of depositions and records of benandanti that were produced from 1600 to 1629, arguing that towards the latter end of this period, benandanti were becoming more open in their denunciations of witches and that inquisitors were increasingly viewing them as a public nuisance rather than as witches themselves. Part IV: The Benandanti at the Sabbat Arguments The benandanti and the Inquisitors In Ginzburg's analysis, the benandanti were a \\"fertility cult\\" whose members were \\"defenders of harvests and the fertility of fields.\\"Ginzburg 1983. p. xx. He noted that by the time of the records of the benandanti that were produced in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, the tradition was still an \\"actual living cult\\" rather than some \\"fossilized superstition\\" from preceding centuries.Ginzburg 1983. p. 84. Ginzburg noted that with the notable exception of the cases brought against Gasparutto and Moduco by Montefalco in 1581, in the period between 1575 and 1619, no case against a benandante was brought to its conclusion. He noted that this was not down to the inefficiency of the Inquisitors, because they were effective in the repression of Lutheranism at the same time, but because they were essentially indifferent to the existence of benandanti beliefs, viewing them as little threat to orthodox Catholic belief.Ginzburg 1983. p. 71. In his original Italian preface, Ginzburg noted that historians of Early Modern witchcraft had become \\"accustomed\\" to viewing the confessions of accused witches as being \\"the consequences of torture and of suggestive questioning by the judges\\".Ginzburg 1983. p. xvii. A pan-European fertility cult Ginzburg argues that the benandanti fertility cult was connected to \\"a larger complex of traditions\\" that were spread \\"from Alsace to Hesse and from Bavaria to Switzerland\\", all of which revolved around \\"the myth of nocturnal gatherings\\" presided over by a goddess figure, varyingly known as Perchta, Holda, Abundia, Satia, Herodias, Venus or Diana. He also noted that \\"almost identical\\" beliefs could be found in Livonia (modern Latvia and Estonia), and that because of this geographic spread \\"it may not be too daring to suggest that in antiquity these beliefs may once have covered much of central Europe.\\"Ginzburg 1983. pp. xx, 44. Relationship to Margaret Murray's theories In the first part of the 20th century, the English Egyptologist and anthropologist Margaret Murray (1863-1963) had published several papers and books propagating a variation of the Witch-cult hypothesis, through which she claimed that the Early Modern witch trials had been an attempt by the Christian authorities to wipe out a pre-existing, pre-Christian religion focused around the veneration of a horned god whom the Christians had demonised as the Devil. Although gaining some initial support from various historians, her theories were always controversial, coming under early criticism from experts in the Early Modern witch trials and pre-Christian religion. Eventually, her ideas came to be completely rejected within the academic historical community, although were adopted by occultists like Gerald Gardner (1884-1964) who used them as a historical basis in his creation of the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca. The definitive rejection of Murray's Witch-Cult theories among academia occurred during the 1970s, when her ideas were attacked by two British historians, Keith Thomas and Norman Cohn, who highlighted her methodological flaws. At the same time, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America - such as Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo - began to publish in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no doubt that those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion. In the original Italian preface to the book, published in 1966, Ginzburg discussed the work of Murray, claiming that although it contained \\"a kernel of truth\\", it had been \\"formulated in a wholly uncritical way\\", containing \\"serious defects\\". With the complete academic rejection of Murray's theories in the 1970s, Ginzburg attempted to clarify his work's relationship to Murray's Witch-Cult theory in his \\"Preface to the English Edition\\", written in 1982. Here, he expressly stated that \\"Murray, in fact, asserted: (a) that witchcraft had its roots in an ancient fertility cult, and (b) that the sabbat described in the witchcraft trials referred to gatherings which had actually taken place. What my work really demonstrated, even if unintentionally, was simply the first point.\\"Ginzburg 1983. p. xiii. He proceeded to accept that although he ultimately rejected her ideas, he reiterated that there was a \\"kernel of truth\\" in Murray's thesis. Some historians have described Ginzburg's ideas as being connected to those of Murray. Hungarian historian G√°bor Klaniczay asserted that \\"Ginzburg reformulated Murray's often fantastic and very inadequately documented thesis about the reality of the witches' Sabbath\\" and thus the publication of I Benandanti in 1966 \\"reopened the debate about the possible interconnections between witchcraft beliefs and the survival of pagan fertility cults\\". Similarly, Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade asserted that while Ginzburg's presentation of the benandanti \\"does not substantiate Murray's entire thesis\\", it did represent a \\"well-documented case of the processus through which a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility is transformed into a merely magical, or even black-magical practice under the pressure of the Inquisition.\\" Conversely, other scholars sought to draw a clear divide between the ideas of Murray and Ginzburg. In 1975, Cohn asserted that Ginzburg's discovery had \\"nothing to do\\" with the theories put forward by Murray. Echoing these views, in 1999 English historian Ronald Hutton asserted that Ginzburg's ideas regarding shamanistic fertility cults were actually \\"pretty much the opposite\\" of what Murray had posited. Hutton pointed out that Ginzburg's argument that \\"ancient dream-worlds, or operations on non-material planes of consciousness, helped to create a new set of fantasies at the end of the Middle Ages\\" differed strongly from Murray's argument that an organised religion of witches had survived from the pre-Christian era and that descriptions of witches' sabbaths were accounts of real events. Reception Upon publication, Ginzburg's hypothesis in The Night Battles received mixed reviews. Some scholars found his theories tantalizing, while others expressed far greater scepticism. In ensuing decades, his work was a far greater influence on scholarship in continental Europe than in the United Kingdom or United States. This is likely because since 1970, the trend for interpreting elements of Early Modern witchcraft belief as having ancient origins proved popular among scholars operating in continental Europe, but far less so than in the Anglo-American sphere, where scholars were far more interested in understanding these witchcraft beliefs in their contemporary contexts, such as their connection to gender and class relations. Continental European scholarship Ginzburg's interpretation of the benandanti tradition would be adopted by a variety of scholars based in continental Europe. It was supported by Eliade. Although the book attracted the attention of many historians studying Early Modern witchcraft beliefs, it was largely ignored by scholars studying shamanism. Anglo-American scholarship Most scholars in the English-speaking world could not read Italian, meaning that when I Benandanti was first published in 1966, the information which it contained remained out of the grasp of the majority of historians studying Early Modern witchcraft in the United States. In order to learn about the benandanti, these scholars therefore relied on the English-language book review produced by the witchcraft historian William Monter, who did read Italian. A summary of Ginzburg's findings was subsequently published in English in the History of Religions journal by Mircea Eliade in 1975. In his book, Europe's Inner Demons (1975), English historian Norman Cohn described I Benandanti as a \\"fascinating book\\". However, he proceeded to assert that there was \\"nothing whatsoever\\" in the source material to justify the idea that the benandanti were the \\"survival of an age-old fertility cult\\". Ronald Hutton asserted that Ginzburg's approach in The Night Battles was \\"heavily Frazerian\\", being based on the theories of Scottish anthropologist Sir James Frazer (1854-1941), themselves widely discredited in the field of anthropology. In The Triumph of the Moon, his 1999 work examining the development of contemporary Pagan Witchcraft, English historian Ronald Hutton of the University of Bristol asserted that Ginzburg was \\"a world-class historian\\" and a \\"brilliant maverick\\". Hutton opined that The Night Battles offered \\"an important and enduring contribution\\" to historical enquiry, but that Ginzburg's claim that the benandanti's visionary traditions were a survival from pre-Christian practices was an idea resting on \\"imperfect material and conceptual foundations.\\" Explaining his reasoning, Hutton remarked that \\"dreams do not self-evidently constitute rituals, and shared dream-imagery does not constitute a 'cult',\\" before noting that Ginzburg's \\"assumption\\" that \\"what was being dreamed about in the sixteenth century had in fact been acted out in religious ceremonies\\" dating to \\"pagan times\\", was entirely \\"an inference of his own\\". He thought that this approach was a \\"striking late application\\" of \\"the ritual theory of myth\\", a discredited anthropological idea associated particularly with Jane Ellen Harrison's 'Cambridge group' and Sir James Frazer.

It grows to a total length of and can be distinguished from other Atlantic species in the genus by the pattern of horizontal bands on its legs. It was discovered by French fishermen in 1963, and has been the subject of small-scale fishery since. It is thought to be overexploited, and is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. Description Palinurus elephas is a related species from the north-east Atlantic Ocean. The total length of Palinurus charlestoni can reach , with the average size around .Holthuis (1991) Like other spiny lobsters, it has five pairs of pereiopods (walking legs), but no chelae (claws).Forest & Postel (1964), p. 105. In life, P. charlestoni is red to violet, but quite variable in colour. The carapace is red with white spots, while the abdomen is red with sharp white stripes on either side of the midline.Forest & Postel (1964), p. 106. P. charlestoni can be distinguished from the other Atlantic species of Palinurus by overall colouration (being less brown than the other species), and more specifically by the patterns on the pereiopods; in P. mauritanicus, they are mottled and in P. elephas they are marked with longitudinal stripes, but in P. charlestoni, they are marked with narrow white bands alternating with wider red bands.Forest & Postel (1964), pp. 109‚Äì110. Distribution and ecology Palinurus charlestoni is endemic to the Cape Verde archipelago. It is found at depths of , but with the greatest densities at depths of . It prefers steep, rocky territory, where the water is at a temperature of . Life cycle Palinurus charlestoni breeds from June onwards, peaking in the period August‚ÄìNovember.Groeneveld et al. (2006), p. 389. The eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods for 4‚Äì5 months until hatching, which begins in November and peaks in December or January. From March to May, females have never been observed carrying eggs. The young animals grow through a series of moults, which have been observed in captivity in February and March.Groeneveld et al. (2006), pp. 392. Females reach sexual maturity at a carapace length of around .Groeneveld et al. (2006), p. 391. During its adult life, Palinurus charlestoni appears to undergo seasonal migrations, preferring waters at a depth of in summer, but in winter.Groeneveld et al. (2006), p. 394. Fishery and management Palinurus charlestoni first became the subject of fisheries in 1963, when three French vessels that had previously fished for P. mauritanicus off Mauritania prospected the waters of the Cape Verde islands.Groeneveld et al. (2006), p. 402. Their catch provided the type specimens for the species description.Forest & Postel (1964), p. 100. In 1966, the Portuguese government extended their territorial waters to offshore, preventing the French boats from fishing those waters. In 1975, Cape Verde declared independence from Portugal, although Portuguese vessels continued to fish there. All catches of P. charlestoni are made with lobster traps, which have evolved in Cape Verde into a distinct local design. Traditional lobster traps are barrel-shaped with a wooden frame, and are long and high. The Cape Verdian traps are half-cylindrical with a metal frame covered in wire netting, and are long, wide and high. Mackerel and horse mackerel are used to bait the traps, which are then left overnight. The size of the historical catch is not known in detail; one estimate for 1976 was 50 t, around 20‚Äì60 t was caught annually between 1982 and 1990, and production probably peaked in 1991/92, when the catch was around 85 t. Since then, the catch has generally shrunk, dropping to 14 t in 1996/97, or 35 t in 1998/99. P. charlestoni is protected by a number of laws in Cape Verde. A limited number of licences are granted (only five in 2006), and a minimum landing size of is applied.Groeneveld et al. (2006), p. 404. A ban on landing egg-bearing females was repealed, and the closed season extended from three to six months (July to November). An estimate of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of P. charlestoni using Fox's surplus production model suggested that the species is being overexploited; it found the MSY to be around 40 t, which could be caught using only 60% of the effort expended on the fishery in 1999. Because of the likely overexploitation, and the species' limited range, it is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List.Cockroft et al. (2011) Taxonomy The Notre- Dame de Rocamadour, part of the original French fishing fleet that discovered P. charlestoni Palinurus charlestoni was first described by Jacques Forest and E. Postel in 1964. The first specimens to be examined scientifically had been collected in late 1963 by the French lobster boat Charleston, operating out of Camaret-sur-Mer, and the specific epithet ' commemorates that boat.Groeneveld et al. (2006), pp. 386‚Äì387.Forest & Postel (1964), p. 101. Further specimens were obtained from other Camaret lobster boats, the Notre-Dame de Rocamadour and the Folgor, and the species was described in the '. Evolution P. charlestoni is one of six extant species in the genus Palinurus.Chan (2010), p. 159. According to analyses of the cytochrome oxidase gene, its nearest relatives are not Palinurus mauritanicus, which lives to the east, off the coast of West Africa, or Palinurus elephas of the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, but the species from the Indian Ocean ‚Äì P. barbarae, P. gilchristi and P. delagoae.Groeneveld et al. (2006), p. 396.Groeneveld et al. (2007) The genus is thought to have evolved in the Indian Ocean; from there, P. charlestoni is thought to have migrated clockwise round Africa, past the Cape of Good Hope, while its neighbour P. mauritanicus migrated anticlockwise, through the Tethys Sea.

It was created by ad agency McKinney for their pro bono client Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD), whose mission \\"is to provide food, clothing, shelter and supportive services to neighbors in need\\". Players must make the difficult decisions necessary to live for one month on $1000, often having to choose between equally disagreeable options. The dilemmas they face represent those that bring people to places like UMD: Do you make a healthy meal or keep the lights on? Cover the minimum on your credit cards or pay the rent? Hope your sick kid gets better on their own or risk your job by leaving early to take them to the doctor? Let your kid play in the after-school sports league or save the money needed for their uniform? The game ends when players either run out of money before the end of the month or make it through with money left over. Since its launch in February 2011, the interactive game Spent has been played more than 4 million times in over 218 countries.  Gameplay  Spent players are given $1,000 to live on for one month. The goal is to end the month with some money left over. Throughout the game's one-month period, players learn how quickly changes in employment, housing, medical costs, and other expenses can have disastrous consequences. Because it's hard to make it on their own, players can ask their Facebook friends for help by posting messages like, \\"I can't pay all my bills this month. Can I borrow some money?\\" and \\"My kid and I got evicted. Can we crash at your place?\\" This connection to social media also serves as organic advertising for the website and makes the experience seem more personal, less like a game. Whether Spent players make it to the end of the month with change in their pockets or whether they run out of money before the month is up, all players are invited to \\"help someone living SPENT today\\" by learning more about UMD's mission and by donating to the not-for-profit organization.  Development  McKinney‚Äôs 11-member team noted that tens of millions of people each month play games like FarmVille and Mafia Wars, harvesting virtual crops and assembling a virtual crime family. They suspected that the characteristics of these fun social network games could engage people in a powerful learning experience about the reality of poverty and homelessness lived daily by those helped by UMD. The team created a brand-integrated online game that makes it personal and visceral just how thin the line is that separates even the most successful of us from the devastation of homelessness. The team conducted focus groups with UMD caseworkers and the families and residents assisted by them in order to glean the details necessary to construct real-life situations for Spent players to negotiate. Using statistics from Durham‚Äôs fair market rent values, the McKinney team determined realistic housing costs to offer players. After deciding whether to live closer to work (where the rent is high but the transportation costs low) or to live farther from work (where the rent is less expensive but the transportation costs much higher), players are shown this message: \\"A lack of affordable housing is the number one cause of homelessness. The definition of ‚Äòaffordable‚Äô housing is 30 percent of income, but you and over 12 million other American households spend way more on housing.\\"  Release and acclaim  In just over 10 months, the game raised $45,000 from 25,000 new UMD donors, and it was praised on CNN, ABC and Fast Company for its ability to increase awareness of poverty in an immersive social media setting. In September 2011, McKinney and UMD launched a petition to the U.S. Congress to take 10 minutes to experience the challenges that more than 14 million Americans are facing on a daily basis by playing SPENT. As of December 2013, the game continued to get about 5,000 new plays each day. To allow for play on mobile devices, an HTML version was released in July 2014, when almost 2 million people had spent an average 11:46 on the site.

Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Vermont was won by incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton over Republican Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, with Clinton winning 53.35% to Dole's 31.09%, a margin of 22.26%. The Reform Party candidate, billionaire businessman Ross Perot, finished in third, with 12.00% of the popular vote. Although Clinton had carried the state comfortably in 1992, prior to that point Vermont had been one of the most reliably Republican states in the nation, voting Republican in every election from 1856 to 1988 except for the 1964 nationwide Democratic landslide. However Vermont had always favored a liberal, secular, Northeastern brand of Republicanism, and by the 1990s, the Republican Party had become increasingly dominated by conservative, Southern, and Evangelical Christian interests. Consequently, Vermont trended increasingly toward the Democratic Party, and Clinton was able to win an even bigger victory in the state in 1996 than he had in 1992, again sweeping every county in the state. Clinton's win in 1996 marked the first time in history that Vermont had voted Democratic in two consecutive presidential elections, signifying a long-term realignment of the state away from the GOP. It was also the first time since 1964 that a Democratic candidate won a majority of the popular vote (Clinton won the state four years prior, but with only a plurality of 46.11%). Since then Vermont has become regarded as one of the safest of blue states; it has remained Democratic in every election that has followed, often by landslide margins.

He was sentenced to death in Iran for allegedly designing and moderating pornographic websites. Malekpour developed an Internet photo-sharing tool that his supporters assert was used without his knowledge for pornographic purposes. Prior to his arrest in Iran in 2008, Malekpour had been living and working in Canada as a permanent resident. The Canadian government and Amnesty International have called for his immediate release. In December 2012, Malekpour's lawyer announced that the death sentence had been suspended because Malekpour had repented for his behavior. On 3 August 2019, Malekpour returned to Canada after escaping Iran through an unknown third country. Life Malekpour was born in Iran in May 1975. He is a graduate of the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, where he earned a degree in metallurgical engineering. Among the jobs he held in Iran, he worked for Iran Khodro, the country's largest automaker. In Iran, Malekpour married Fatima Eftekhari whom he met at a chess competition. In 2004, Malekpour went to Canada with his wife to pursue educational opportunities. He became a permanent resident of Canada and from 2005 worked as a website designer in the country. Malekpour and his wife resided in Richmond Hill, Ontario. Arrest and prosecution In October 2008, Malekpour visited his dying father in Iran; he was about to enroll in a master's program at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. Iranian authorities arrested Malekpour during his visit, accusing him of designing and moderating pornographic websites. Malekpour had designed photo uploading software, and according to his supporters, that software was being used without his knowledge for the creation of an adult website. Malekpour has been kept in Iran's Evin prison, and was initially placed for almost a year in solitary confinement without legal representation. A year after his arrest, Malekpour confessed to his crimes on Iranian state television. He later retracted the confession in letter sent from inside prison. Malekpour wrote, \\"A large portion of my confession was extracted under pressure, physical and psychological torture, threats to myself and my family, and false promises of immediate release upon giving a false confession to whatever the interrogators dictated ... Such mistreatment was aimed at forcing me to write what the interrogators were dictating, and to compel me to play a role in front of the camera based on their scenarios.\\" First death sentence In December 2010, Malekpour was sentenced to death after being found guilty of \\"designing and moderating adult content websites\\", \\"agitation against the regime\\", and \\"insulting the sanctity of Islam\\". In June 2011, however, the Supreme Court of Iran reportedly annulled the verdict in the face of Canadian government protests. Following the reversal, Malekpour was set to remain in jail while a judicial review into his case was held. Second death sentence Despite its earlier decision, the Supreme Court announced its verdict was inconclusive and remanded the case to the court that originally sentenced Malekpour. The death sentence was upheld, and in January 2012, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Malekpour's lawyers. The Canadian government condemned the decision and called for Malekpour's immediate release. Amnesty International also called for his release, describing the case as part of a general \\"crackdown on freedom of expression ahead of the Iranian parliamentary elections in March\\". Suspension of death sentence In December 2012, Malekpour's lawyer announced that the death sentence had been suspended because Malekpour had \\"repented for his actions\\". Community A crowdfunding campaign was created to help raise money to Free Saeed Malekpour.  Escape and Return to Canada  On 3 August 2019, Malekpour returned to Canada after being released by Iranian authorities on furlough 'a few days ago' and escaped Iran through a third country that is not being revealed.

The state park occupies surrounding Grafton Notch, the mountain pass between Old Speck Mountain and Baldpate Mountain. The park is abutted by the eastern and western sections of the Mahoosuc Public Reserved Land, which total . The park is managed by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. History In 1963, the state made its first acquisitions of the land for the park with the purchase of from Brown Company. The addition of 18 more parcels, many less than 5 acres, took place in the 1960s, mostly in 1964. The park boundaries were fixed with the addition on two one-acre parcels in 1977. Wildlife Songbirds, migratory birds and occasionally raptors (specifically eagles, falcons, and hawks) are spotted in this park by birdwatchers. Mammalian species such as black bear moose, fox, bobcat, coyote, fisher, and white-tailed deer roam on the hiking trails.http://www.exeternh.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/break_for_moose.pdf  Geology  Grafton Notch reflects the glaciation processes carved by the Laurentide Ice sheet during the Wisconsin Glaciation episode. Notable geomorphology of the park includes U-shaped valleys, gorges, and esker. Erosional processes expose the unique bedrock composed of Devonian granite with pegmatite intrusions. Poorly sorted diamicton and stratified gravel pits indicate glacial and glacio-fluvial depositional processes at work. Additionally, these processes scattered erratics over the u-shaped valley floor. Noteworthy gorges in Grafton Notch include Screw Auger Falls, Mother Walker Falls and Moose Cave. Screw Auger Falls is located within a steep gorge along the Bear River; when water levels are low enough, erratics are visible in the stream. Steep cliff faces and flat valley floor seen from Mother Walker Falls are characteristic of glacial erosion. However, responsibility for gorge formation is debated; \\"they may have formed while the ice sheet retreated north of the region and contributed a large quantity of meltwater, or more likely, they formed while the ice sheet covered the area and the subglacial water was under very high pressure\\". Whether a particular landform was created by local glacier or continental ice sheet is also still debated. Many pegmatite vein intrusions are visible around the water-eroded bedrock of the gorges. Activities and amenities The park's mountain scenery includes the Screw Auger and Mother Walker waterfalls and Moose Cave. Recreational opportunities include fishing, hunting, and picnicking. Hiking trails include a rugged stretch of the Appalachian Trail. The ice climbing in the area is extensive and offers a variety of climbing for the beginner as well as the advanced.

It is owned by the British drinks giant Diageo. The distillery was built in 1821 by Peter Brown with two stills, and started production in 1825 with a capacity of 4,500 litres per year. The distillery was operated by James Walker until Browns death in 1868, after which the distillery went under the control of his son, William Brown. Between 1872 and 1873 William Brown, the son of Peter Brown designed and built a new distillery with help of architect Methven, replacing the old one on the same location. The new distillery had a capacity of 227,000 litres per year. After William Browns death, the Linkwood-Glenlivet company was created by Browns family in 1898 and brought to the stock exchange. The distillery was then further extended to a capacity of 454,000 litres per year. In 1902 Innes Cameron joined the Linkwood-Glenlivet company and became managing director of the Linkwood distillery until his death in 1932. By that time he was the largest shareholder of the company. The company was sold to Scottish Malt Distillers, which itself was bought by United Distillers. After temporary closure between 1941 and 1945 as a result of barley shortage during World War II, the distillery reopened in 1945 under Roderick Mackenzie, who led the distillery until 1963. Mackenzie believed that all things in the distillery contributed to the final product. In 1962, Scottish Malt Distillers decided the distillery needed to be completely refurbished. Mackenzie oversaw the rebuilding of the distillery in his last year as general manager. The distillery was electrified, replacing the steam engine and water wheel that powered the distillery before, and all stills were replaced with exact replicas of the former stills. In 1971 a second distillery was built alongside the first, which became known as Linkwood B, with steam heated stills. The stills of the first distillery were converted to being heated by steam as well. With the build of Linkwood B the two distilleries reached their current combined capacity of 2.5 million litres per year. The distillery was mothballed between 1985 and 1988.

It is located between the Milan-Bergamo highway and the eastern road ring of Monza. It is away from the town center. History During the Carolingian period San Damiano was a village built around a monastery under the supervision of Saint Ambrose of Milan. In a document dating to the year 853, San Damiano housed a church dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian. During the Middle Ages the town did not host any important events. By the 14th century, the town still existed.mentioned in the statutes of the waters and roads of the countryside of Milan made in 1346 as Saint Damian Baraza In the 16th century a local parish was built by Saint Charles Borromeo, alas San Damiano did not join the parish given its population would be forced to pay a fee for the parish priest's allowance. San Damiano remained in the parish of San Gerardo in Monza. By 1751 it was a separate municipality with 75 inhabitants administered by a consul elected by the population. In 1805, with the proclamation of the napoleonic Kingdom of Italy the number of residents was 178. In 1809, the town was under the control of Napoleon and its jurisdiction was merged with Monucco's, then together merging with the one of Monza in 1811. On 12 February 1816 the Austrians re-established it as an independent municipality and it remained so for 50 years. In 1853 San Damiano had 363 inhabitants. In 1863 it was renamed San Damiano of Monza but in 1866 the commune was annexed definitively to the new town of Brugherio after a strong debate. The mayor of Baraggia (future mayor of Brugherio) convinced the citizens of San Damiano to merge with the new municipality. Religious life San Damiano is under the control of Sant'Albino's parish that is from the administrative point of view under Monza's supervision, but from the perspective of the religious community under the pastoral Epiphany of the Lord in Brugherio. The Church of Saint Anne can be found on the village's land. Education In San Damiano there are three schools that are part of the Istituto Comprensivo Via Nazario Sauro: Fratelli Grimm kindergarten, Corridoni primary school and Eduardo De Filippo secondary school. Culture and Sports In San Damiano, some holidays are celebrated: one in June that is organised by the Department for Cultural Heritage of Brugherio and takes place in a neighborhood north of the city; and another in November. The town's local musical band was formed in 1906, and still is involved in several local events. In addition, the A.S. societ√† sportiva San Damiano-Sant'Albino, whose colors are white and amaranth, is found in this town.

The shipwreck gained notoriety because the captain, Giuseppe Piccone, abandoned ship at the first opportunity. The wreck had a profound effect on communities in northern Italy and was remembered in popular songs of the era. Background Sirio was a 4,141-ton, 5,012-horsepower steamboat built in 1883 in Glasgow and owned by Navigazione Generale Italiana of Genoa. She sailed on the Raggio Line, operated by the Societa Italiana di Transporti Maritimi Raggio & Co. She left Genoa on 2 August and picked up additional passengers in Barcelona, and was en route for Cadiz, carrying eight hundred third-class passengers migrating to Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. The captain later stated that there were 645 passengers (570 embarked in Genoa, the rest were picked up in Barcelona) and 127 crew members on board. Wreck The sinking of the SS Sirio, by Benedito Calixto The ship ran aground on the Punta Hormigas, a reef off Hormigas Island, two and a half miles east of Cape Palos, Cartagena, Spain. According to an eyewitness, the captain of the French steamer Marie Louise, she was \\"taking a dangerous course\\" when he saw her stop, her bow lifting. The boilers exploded, and \\"dead bodies began to float past the French steamer, and those on board could hear the shrieks of the drowning.\\" A boat was launched that saved 29 passengers, while the Marie Louise herself saved another 25. Three-hundred passengers, most of them Italian and Spanish, lost their lives. Among the passengers were a number of Catholic officials. The Bishop of S√£o Paulo, Jos√© de Camargo Barros, \\"went down with the ship while blessing the drowning passengers.\\" The Archbishop of S√£o Pedro, Cl√°udio Gon√ßalves Ponce de Leon, survived. Boniface Natter, the first abbot of the rededicated Buckfast Abbey (a Benedictine abbey in England), drowned as well; his fellow traveler, Anscar Vonier, survived and became the next abbot. A panic broke out on the ship, with people being trampled and others throwing themselves in the sea while knife-fights broke out over the lifeboats.One Italian-American protested in a letter to The New York Times against the portrayal of Italians fighting over the lifeboats, acting \\"as savages and bloodthirsty men\\": An article in The American Marine Engineer, repeating some of the horror stories reported in the media, claimed that \\"the lower class of emigrants from Southern Europe cannot be trusted with knives and pistols at any time....The officers and crew were powerless to cope with the horde of Italians who fought for the boats.\\" Terrifying scenes of mothers grieving over their drowned children were described. One report claimed that the captain and his officers tried to restore order, but it soon emerged that he had been the first to abandon ship. Rescue efforts Local fishermen launched boats to aid in the rescue, but it was reported that some of the rescuers also drowned. Captains of two ships, Joven Miguel and Vicente Llicano (which saved 300 and 200 passengers, respectively), were singled out for their heroism. Survivors were brought ashore and put up in the local poorhouse and a circus building. Aftermath The ship broke in two after being grounded for nine days, and \\"dozens of decomposing corpses were released in the turbulence\\" including \\"the body of a very young girl still clutching her toy bucket.\\" While initial reports claimed three hundred had died, improper passenger lists made it difficult to determine the exact number, although some reports estimated that as many as four hundred died. Later accounts put the death toll in excess of one hundred and fifty. The New York Times reported that Captain Piccone died of \\"grief\\" and \\"a broken heart\\" in Genoa less than a year after the disaster. Investigation of the captain's behavior Newspaper reports quickly accused the captain and his crew of improper behavior. Days after the disaster it became known worldwide that the officers had abandoned ship immediately. The captain departed first, causing a panic among the passengers. It was soon reported, incorrectly, that he had committed suicide by shooting himself. One explanation for the ship's unusual course was given by the Spanish newspaper Espa√±a Nueva: the ship was alleged to have sailed so close because it \\"engaged in the clandestine embarkation of Spanish emigrants along the coast,\\" in exchange for \\"large sums of money.\\" This alleged \\"illicit traffic\\" was offered as one explanation for the captain's behavior, which \\"left much to be desired.\\" Legacy The wreck of Sirio had a major impact on the victims' communities. According to sociologist Chiara Bond√¨, the accident was a \\"prototypical Italian disaster.\\" The effect on the northern Italian communities from which the emigrants came was profound, and the wreck was remembered in a popular ballad, \\"Il Sirio\\", which sings of the Sirio that \\"sailed away for America, and to its misfortune,\\" \\"convey[ing] the agony of frantic parents looking for children who had gone under the waves.\\" Another ballad, \\"Mamma Mia, Dammi Cento Lire\\", possibly refers to Sirio as well‚Äîit tells the story of a young man who asks his mother for 100 lire so he can sail to America, but \\"out on the ocean wide, / The great ship sank beneath the tide.\\" The Spanish poet Santiago Delgado published a memorial \\"legend\\" about the disaster in a collection of eight pieces about the Mar Menor, the lagoon just north of Hormigas Island.

Born in Muskegon, Michigan, Donna was one of twelve children into the family of Sidney and Daisy (n√©e Johnson) Cook. She played five years of organized softball before joining the league with her hometown team, just days after graduating from Muskegon Heights High School. In 1946 Cook opened at right field for the Muskegon Lassies. She had a .156 average in 78 games. The next year she was switched to pitcher and became a proven starter, turning in a 14‚Äì8 record with a sparkling 1.42 earned run average, as the Lassies posted a 69‚Äë43 record en route to win the regular season championship in a close pennant race.

He lived in Tokyo, Japan, and travelled the world teaching the principles of Aikido. A former student of Morihei Ueshiba, Sensei Kato taught from 1986 onwards in his Dojo \\"Suginami Aikikai\\" (affiliated to Aikikai World Headquarters) located in the Ogikubo district of Tokyo and has over 55 students.  Early life and training  Kato-sensei was born in Tokyo. He began Aikido training in 1954 at Aikido World Headquarters (Hombu Dojo) under the instruction of the Founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba otherwise known as O‚ÄôSensei. Introduced to the Aikikai Hombu Dojo through his mother‚Äôs network of connections when he was 19, he trained there daily as well as spending long hours perfecting his personal practice. Working during the day as a printer, he attended classes at night, and for this reason he was unable to be an uchideshi, and does not appear in early photographs with them. He continued to train for over 52 years at the Aikikai Hombu Dojo although he later primarily taught at his Suginami Dojo, but he still attended special events at Aikikai Hombu dojo. After his first 10 years at Hombu Dojo, Kato-sensei occasionally had chances to personally serve the Founder. He pursued Aikido through the Founder‚Äôs image, as according to Kato-sensei, ‚ÄúTo me, the Founder is not dead. He is still alive in my mind and in my heart.‚Äù Kato attended Doshu‚Äôs class over three generations: the Founder, the second Doshu, and the current third Doshu. He received his first six black belts from the Founder and his next two black belts from the second Doshu. His self-training in Aikido has been ascetic. In his early years, he often used to practice weapons by himself through the night, greet sunrise the next morning, and then go to work again. Kato's Aikido had a measure of personal spirituality to it. Before every class, Kato Sensei arrived early to the dojo to meditate. Since he was young, he visited mountain shrines and stayed up all night practicing weapons and meditating. Kato regarded O‚ÄôSensei with utmost respect and considered him to be his only teacher. He said, \\"Aikido is not something to learn from others, but to learn by oneself. Ideally, the practice should be for oneself, and it should be rigorous and sternly self-disciplined, by one‚Äôs own choice.\\" Teaching and achievements In 1965, an informal practice group named Yagyu-kai was formed under his guidance and direction. Most of the members were black belt holders and he enjoyed teaching, hard training, and lively conversation after practice. In 1987, he established Suginami Aikikai (near Ogikubo Station) in Suginami-ku, as a branch dojo under Aikikai Hombu Dojo. The former Yagyu-kai was then incorporated into Suginami Aikikai. At this time, Sensei Kato continued to practice at Hombu. He retired from his work as a printer and taught Aikido full-time. In 1994, he received 8th dan and in the same year, he began to teach Aikido in the US. He traveled to the U.S. to teach Aikido at his branch dojos in California and in Texas twice a year. He also offers seminars at other Aikikai affiliated dojos as a guest instructor. From 1999 through 2001, he received commendation for his contribution of promoting Aikido in Houston from the Mayor of Houston. In October 2006, he was recognized for his Aikido contributions by a proclamation of Hiroshi Kato Day from the Mayor of Midland, Texas. In 2001, Suginami Aikikai received commendation from the Governor of Tokyo as an Excellent Organization. This year, he also began to teach Aikido at the Ogikubo Sports Center in Tokyo which is the official place of gathering for the Suginami Aikikai members. He also visited and taught Aikido in Indonesia every year at IAI (Institut Aikido Indonesia)- Suginami Aikikai. Institut Aikido Indonesia - Suginami Aikikai Reflecting its depth and maturity as a dojo, there are now quite a few high level yudansha (such as 5th and 6th dans) in Suginami Aikikai. Philosophy of Aikido For Kato Hiroshi Sensei, Aikido is a way of life not just a martial art (Budo). Sensei Kato's Aikido is a style that resembles much of the one taught at Hombu Dojo by Shihans such as Watanabe Nobuyuki and Endo Seichiro (although not as intense as these two) in a sense that he practices the no-touch throws, using the momentum of the uke but without much touching him. Strong Hip movements are applied together with slight feet pivoting movements as well. Kato Sensei derives his Taijitsu movements from his weapons teachings (Bokuto and Jo). Due to his advanced age, Kato Sensei's classes are not as vigorous as many would expect but it is the depth and breadth of the technique that his students seek to develop. Death Hiroshi Kato Sensei died on 2 December 2012.

The village uses historical re-enactments to communicate the history of rural communities in the former townships of Westminster, London, North Dorchester, Delaware, West Nissouri and Lobo in Middlesex County from 1820 to 1920 and the founding and development of the City of London up to 1840. The pioneer village is owned and operated by the London and Middlesex Heritage Museum, a not-for-profit charity, with the support of the City of London, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority, the Municipality of Thames Centre and the Municipality of Middlesex Centre. The intended purpose of the pioneer village is to involve the community in the preservation of history and tradition through living history experiences. History Fanshawe Pioneer Village was first conceived in 1955 under the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority's responsibility to conserve historic structures in the Upper Thames watershed. The Village officially opened on June 26, 1959 with support from Dr. Wilfrid Jury, Director of the University of Western Ontario's Museum of Indian Archaeology and Pioneer Life. In 1961, the site was enlarged to 2.2 acres and in 1963, the Authority set aside an additional 22 acres for future development. Wilfrid Jury had accumulated a large collection of pioneer artefacts which were exhibited at Middlesex College, University of Western Ontario. This collection was brought to the Village and formally donated to the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority in 1978. By 1980, the Village consisted of 23 buildings placed throughout the original 22 acres. Today the village consists of 33 original and replica historic structures on 46 acres. Museum and programmes Collection Fanshawe Pioneer Village contains a collection of material culture significant to the history of the city of London and Middlesex County. The collection includes over 25,000 artefacts representing furniture, decorative arts, costumes and textiles, archival materials, domestic tools, vehicles as well as agricultural and industrial tools and equipment. The collection has been assembled through donations from residents of London and Middlesex County who have donated their artefacts. Educational events As part of their attempt to encourage community involvement, Fanshawe Pioneer Village hosts a number of historically based events every year. Buildings Fanshawe Pioneer Village is the site of 33 historic buildings with origins spanning one hundred years. The Village is separated into four historical clusters to depict the development of the community. Fanshawe Settlement 1820-1850 Elgie Log House Fanshawe Settlement 1820-1850 is intended to be representative of the impact upon the land and aboriginal people by settlers who immigrated from Europe and other parts of North America to the London area in the first half of the 19th century. * Log School ‚Äì A replica building reminiscent of the first log schools built by the Talbot settlers on their concession after homes were established. Circa 1830s. * Elgie Log House -Representative of the first home of the Talbot settlers in London Township, circa 1820. * Colbert Log Barn - 1840s drive through barn built with rock elm logs. Fanshawe Corners 1850-1880 Purple Hill Lodge Representative of the first stage of urban development at a transportation crossroads. *Blacksmith Shop-Entrepreneurs, like blacksmiths, chose transportation crossroads to establish off-farm businesses. *Corbett Tavern - An 1840s tavern that provided accommodation, food and stabling for horses to the traveling public and served as the community meeting place. *Lochaber Church - This Free Presbyterian Church was constructed in 1884. *Mount Moriah Lodge - Masonic orders held their first meetings in local taverns until purpose built halls like this one could be constructed. The interior is representative of an early 19th-century London Masonic Hall. *Purple Hill Lodge - Established by the Protestant Irish immigrants who brought Orangeism with them when they came to Canada. Many settled areas in the region of what is now southwestern Ontario built meeting halls for the orange order, including townships in the London district. These buildings were also a focal point for the community, providing a place where settlers could get to know their neighbors through dances, dinners, recitals and concerts. Fanshawe Township 1880-1910 Jury Farmstead Tells the story of farming, as it becomes the economic engine that drives development in London and Middlesex County. *The Caverhill Farmstead - The Caverhill Farm represents the established farm of a first generation family after several decades of settlement. *Fanshawe School - Schools for children of the second generation were formalized by the Province with established curricula and required attendance. Even the architecture was standardized, and this 1871 example of a one-room school house is typical of many in Middlesex County. *Jury Farmstead - Boyhood home of Wilfrid Jury, the founder of Fanshawe Pioneer Village. The Jury Farmstead is representative of a second generation farm at the turn of the 20th century. The Town of Fanshawe 1910-1920 Trinity Anglican Church Tells the story of the rapid changes that marks the 20th century. *Alder's Weaving Shed- Thomas Alder's original weaving shed dating from the 1850s. *Denfield General Store - Here customers could purchase or order any supplies they could not grow or raise themselves, obtain needed credit or communicate with the world through the telegraph, telephone or mail. *Peel House- Boyhood home of London artist Paul Peel. The building is representative of an urban home at the turn of the 19th century. *Harmer Sawmill- Sawmills milled lumber for local construction. Frame construction quickly overtook log as the dominant architecture style because of the availability of local mills. *Dr. Jones House and Barn‚Äì This homestead is located on the edge of the Town. While the barns are still in use, the farm land is rented to others, indicating that the owner has another income, that of a rural doctor. *The Print Shop- Typical turn of the century print shop which produces the London Free Press and Farmers Advocate as well as printed materials made to order. *Trinity Anglican Church- 1887 Anglican church designated by the Province as an excellent example of carpenter Gothic church architecture.

CABs are especially associated with clinical research, in which case they review the clinical research ethics associated with the human subject research which a medical research institution conducts. CABs are an aspect of community-based participatory research. Purpose Community advisory boards (CABs) benefit research institutions by providing advice about the efficacy of the informed consent process and the implementation of research protocols. The CAB composition is representative of the community participating in the research being reviewed. Researchers who consult with CABs get information which they would not otherwise get about the target community demographic which they are researching. Ethics The CAB is intended to be a way to respect the rights of research participants. Research in a community has the potential for group harm, which is distinct from the individual harm which can happen to individuals who participate. See recommendation 17 Because of the risk to communities, researchers have an obligation to community stakeholders to seek community feedback about the research. Duties of CABs CABs and researchers must continually decide which powers to invest in a CAB. Here are some common questions which must be decided: #What interaction should CABs have with institutional review boards? #What education and training should the research institution give to the CAB members to enable them to perform their duties? #To what extent should CABs participate in the development of informed consent processes? #To what extent should CABs participate in developing guidelines to determine whether research participants give sufficient consent? #In emergency situations, to what extent can CABs provide consultation on what response researchers should have to the emergency? #When study participants have ethical problems with the research, to what extent should the CAB directly receive those participants' concerns? #When CABs perceive the inevitable lapses in sufficient protection for research participants which occasionally and naturally occur in any study, what power should the CAB have to direct rectification of this lapse? #To what extent should CABs direct the empowerment of their communities to more fully and beneficially participate in research? Guidelines A community advisory board has whatever duties the members invest in it, but various organizations have suggested that they have certain responsibilities. Besides not knowing what CABs should do, it is difficult to determine what CABs should not do. Some of the perennial problems with CABs are determining the following: who in a community can serve on a CAB, the extent to which the CAB directs research, and the extent to which the community directs the execution of the research. Researchers find that research is more productive and ethical when researchers train, recruit, and integrate members from the population targeted by the research into the research team. In consulting with the community, researchers have to meet with individuals who represent a common culture, have a communication network with the community they represent, and have a system for voicing the community's priorities. Overseeing genetic research In 2000 the National Institute of General Medical Sciences held a conference which defined some CAB duties. Those duties are as follows: Reproduced here verbatim. #Define community in appropriate and meaningful ways. #Understand the potential benefits and risks of research for communities and community members. #Obtain broad community input for all phases of research. #Respect communities as full partners in research. #Resolve all issues pertaining to tissue samples. #Establish appropriate review mechanisms and procedures. #Facilitate the return of benefits to communities. #Foster education and training in community-based research. #Ensure dissemination of accurate information to the media and the public. #Provide sufficient funds for research and encourage community‚Äìresearcher partnerships. Challenges in developing countries As part of international development many research institutions medical research in developing countries. When this happens, they often opt to get advice from the local community through a CAB. The process of setting up CABs in developing countries has its own problems.

Unlike typical penny-farthing bicycles, the Copeland had small wheel at the front, which was turned by the handlebar for steering, and large wheel at the back. In 1884 Copeland used an American Star bicycle, smaller steering wheel in front, to construct a new demonstration vehicle for the Maricopa County Fair that year. The \\"Star\\" was able to cover a mile in four minutes and to carry enough water to operate for an hour. Copeland set up the Northrop Manufacturing Co. in 1887 in Camden, New Jersey, to produce the a three-wheeled version, the \\"Phaeton Moto-Cycle\\", which he demonstrated at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C in 1888. The steam-powered engine produced 4 horsepower at 2600 rpm with a boiler around the steering column with the water heated by kerosene.

The aircraft had reached an altitude of no more than 500 feet when the airspeed suddenly dropped because of thermal currents it encountered during the climb out. This caused the airplane to stall less than from the airport, crash and catch fire, killing all 156 passengers and 10 crew on board. To date, it remains the deadliest aviation accident in Kazakhstan. Accident At the time of the accident Alma-Ata was experiencing a heat wave. It was around 00:39 and Flight 4225 took off from Alma-Ata Airport in Soviet Kazakhstan. Only a few seconds after take off, the flight reached 500 feet. The weather was not on the flight's side; the plane reached a zone of hot air and then the Soviet aircraft's airspeed dramatically dropped and the plane was caught in a big downdraft. The Tupolev stalled and plummeted, nose down, into a farm near the suburbs of Alma-Ata. It slid into a ravine, caught fire and disintegrated, killing everyone on board. Investigation The Soviet aviation board concluded that the crash was caused by windshear which took place while the aircraft was near its maximum takeoff weight for the local conditions which included mountains.

During the initial stages of the battle, the rebel FSA took control of the town. However, less than a month later, the Army retook control of Zabadani, forcing rebel fighters to withdraw towards the Lebanese border. Battle First phase The battle began when the city was stormed by the Syrian army on 7 January 2012. This operation followed large-scale anti-government protests in the city and in the wider Rif Dimashq Governorate. An anti-government activist group claimed that 12 civilians including three children were killed when the town was bombarded by tanks in the initial operation. Zabadani was once again stormed by the Syrian army on 13 January. However, their attack was repelled by the Free Syrian Army (FSA), which held control of large parts of the city. The Syrian army held its positions on the outskirts. Amateur video footage obtained by Reuters showed armed FSA fighters patrolling empty streets. On 18 January, both sides agreed to a ceasefire. It was also agreed that the Syrian army would leave the city and that the FSA would remove its forces from the streets. A senior opposition figure, Kamal al-Labwani, said \\"I think stiff resistance and defections among the attacking forces have forced the regime to negotiate. We will see if it will stick to the deal\\". He claimed that 30 loyalist soldiers and an unknown number of defected soldiers had been killed during the battle on 13 January. The ceasefire was temporarily broken on 30 January, when an FSA fighter was killed by Ba'athist government troops. However, by the end of the day, the situation at Zabadani still remained tense but calm. A top Iranian Revolutionary Guard official said that Hezbollah forces took part in the fighting in Zabadani in January. Second phase On 4 February, it was reported by activists that the Syrian army was shelling the area with mortars and firing on FSA troops with heavy machine guns, and had started to storm Zabadani's outskirts. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria said that 300 armored vehicles, including 100 tanks were involved in the offensive. This report could not be verified independently. The SOHR, another activist source based in London, said to the AFP that hundreds of armored vehicles assaulted the city of Zabadani on 6 February. According to activist videos Zabadani was still under shelling on 7 February. On 8 February, activists said that at least 10 residents had died from the shelling in recent days, and state media reported that four members of the special forces were killed outside of Zabadani. They claimed that a number of opposition forces were killed in the clash. It was also reported that during the fighting, a foreign jihadist, Abu Hamza al-Shami, was also killed. Two days later, several activists sources reported that the Syrian army took control of Madaya, a city located just a few kilometers south of Zabadani which was, according to the same activists, surrounded and under a renewed shelling from the army. 300px The Local Coordination Committees said that the army was heavily pounding the city for a 6th day in a row with 150 shells hitting the city, killing seven people and injuring 40. They added that the Syrian army was located as close as 300 meters south of the city entrance. The Committee estimated that 300 armored vehicles and 30,000 soldiers were involved in the battle, but it could not be confirmed and was highly unlikely. On 11 February, the Syrian army entered Zabadani after a renewed shelling and seized parts of the town. An exiled Syrian activist in Jordan said that a ceasefire had been agreed in Zabadani and that the army entered the city. It stipulates that the army would not pursue the rebels if they hand over their stolen weapons. He added that 100 people were killed in the bombardment of the city. A video was shown of a SAA tank in flames. On 13 February, activists reported that the Syrian army was conducting attacks and arrests in Zabadani and Madaya. A contact of Irish Times journalist told that the army had arrested some rebel fighters and allowed others to flee, with ongoing house to house conducted. Many residents fled to Bludan were the red cross sent an aid convoy. Footage of Zabadani was published on 13 February, on the Syrian State TV, showing interviews with residents and some of the weapons seized. A pro-rebel resident said that the Syrian army broke a deal by sending soldiers to take over the city and said that dozens of people suspected of being rebels had been captured. Journalist John Ray and his cameraman made a video report about the battle, showing footage of the fighting and the advance of the Syrian army. The Army advanced from the city toward the hillsides where rebels were hiding, progressing and trapping the rebels against the Lebanon border. The opposition-affiliated L.C.C. claimed that the Syrian army had arrested 250 members of the opposition. A Lebanese smuggler told that the Syrian army had successfully cut the rebels supply lines in the city. Aftermath Renewed fighting A month later on 12 March, clashes were reported once again in Zabadani, with many being wounded. On 27 March, the military shelled the town again, which killed four residents. Two days later on 29 March, more fighting was reported in the town. May stalemate In May, much of Zabadani was once again reportedly out of SAA control, with army checkpoints on the roads leading into and out of the city and security forces guarding government buildings in the town, but not venturing outside to such places as the central square. Around 450 FSA fighters were in the orchards outside of Zabadani, but they didn't have a presence in the town itself. Instead, opposition activists were reporting from within the city via walkie-talkies and organizing protests.

The book made a number of scandals at the time, due to the blunt language it used to describe different figures from the political leadership of Israel at the time, and especially due to a description of Shimon Peres, Rabin's political rival, as \\"an indefatigable subversive\\" (or \\"tireless schemer,\\" Hebrew: \\"◊î◊ó◊™◊®◊ü ◊î◊ë◊ú◊™◊ô ◊†◊ú◊ê◊î\\"), a nickname that stuck to the latter. The book was published in two volumes.  Overview  In the book Rabin reviews his stations in life until the time of the writing of the book, including his childhood, fighting in the Palmach, his military career, his tenure as ambassador to the United States and as Prime Minister of Israel. Among other things, Rabin wrote about controversial affairs: the expulsion of the Arabs during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the sinking of Altalena and more. However, most media attention focused on his beliefs about his partner at the labor Party ‚Äì Shimon Peres. Rabin ruled that Peres is \\"Disqualified from serving as prime minister\\". Journalist Nissim Mishal first revealed the information from reading the book in draft form, on the eve of its publication. Rabin was especially angry about the leaks from Peres and his associates to the press, at Rabin's first tenure as Prime Minister. Peres referred to the book as \\"a typo in Israeli politics\\". Rabin's critics claim, in addition to the harsh tone, that there are many inaccuracies, showing, if anything, the perception of reality by Rabin, but not historical facts. For example, historian Michael Bar-Zohar (considered a supporter of Shimon Peres) said that \\"the chapters in which [Rabin] talks about Operation Entebbe, he simply wrote things that do not correspond to the truth. [...] personal feelings are allowed to be expressed in an autobiography, but when you're not precise with the facts about an important event like Entebbe, to say the least, it's just not fair\\".

A massive program of Russian language education was imposed at the expense of the Estonian language and Russian replaced Estonian as the sole language in certain areas of the economy such as banking, mining, energy production, statistics, railways, naval and air transport. Estonians had to learn Russian in order to keep their jobs. By the 1980s, Russian was established as the official language while the Estonian language was effectively reduced to that of a de facto minority language within the country. Due to the increasing restrictions upon the public use of the Estonian language in Estonia, the extinction of the Estonian language had become a real possibility. After the restoration of independence in 1989, the Estonian language was proclaimed the sole official state language and the Language Act was promulgated as a remedy to the problem of the growth of Russian monolingualism during the Soviet period. The Language Act was based upon the principle of Russian/Estonian bilingualism which requires that the holders of certain jobs be proficient in Estonian in addition to Russian. The Act impacted those who were employed in positions that involve communication with the public or subordinates in state administration and in most cases required an elementary level of knowledge of around 800 words, impacting about 12% of the Russian speaking population. The Language Inspectorate was thus established to supervise the implementation of the Language Act. Later, new Language Acts were adopted, in 1995 and 2011.Language Act In 2006, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance has noted that \\"it appears that no system has been put in place to monitor the Language Inspectorate's implementation of the Law on Language\\" and that \\"the Language Inspectorate does not appear to take into account regional specificities when applying the Language Law\\".ECRI Third report on Estonia CRI(2006)1‚ÄîPara. 18 In 2010, ECRI has repeated the recommendation to establish a monitoring mechanism for the work of the Language Inspectorate, and recommended \\"regular consultation with representatives of Russian-speaking minorities on the work of the Language Inspectorate in order to improve the manner in which it is perceived by members of this group\\".ECRI Fourth Report on Estonia CRI(2010)3‚ÄîPara. 24 According to the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, in 2007, the Language Inspectorate was given power to recommend the dismissal of employees with insufficient language proficiency, to make people holding language certificates re-sit an exam.Commissioner for Human Rights Memorandum to the Estonian Government CommDH(2007)12‚ÄîPara. 17 According to comments of Estonian government to CoE report, that was factually incorrect as the Inspectorate has always had these powers from inception.Commissioner for Human Rights Memorandum to the Estonian Government CommDH(2007)12‚ÄîAnnex References External links * Category:Government agencies of Estonia Category:Language policy ","title":"Language Inspectorate"},{"id":"34421535","text":"The Kentucky meat shower was an incident occurring between the hours of eleven and twelve o'clock for a period of several minutes on March 3, 1876, where what appeared to be chunks of red meat measuring approximately ; with at least one being fell from the sky in a area near the settlement of Rankin in Bath County, Kentucky. There exist several explanations as to how this occurred and what the \\"meat\\" was, the most popular being the vulture theory, in which a group of vultures regurgitated their meals; and the pieces fell to earth from a reasonable height. The exact type of meat was never identified, although various reports suggested it was beef, lamb, deer, bear, horse, or even human. Incident At the time, Mrs. Crouch, a farmer‚Äôs wife, was making soap on her porch when she reported seeing the meat pieces fall from the sky. She said she was 40 steps from her house when the meat started to slap the ground. The meat looked gristly, according to Mrs. Crouch. Mrs. Crouch and her husband believed the event signified a sign from God. A similar event was later reported in Europe. The phenomenon was reported by Scientific American, The New York Times, and several other publications at the time.(21 March 1876). The Carnal Rain ‚Äì Careful Investigation of the Kentucky Marvel by a Correspondent, New York Herald, p. 4, col. 1 Most of the pieces were approximately ; at least one was . The meat appeared to be beef, but according to the first report in Scientific American, two gentlemen who tasted it judged it to be lamb or deer. B. F. Ellington, a local hunter, identified it as bear meat. Writing in the Sanitarian, Leopold Brandeis identified the substance as Nostoc, a type of cyanobacteria. Brandeis gave the meat sample to the Newark Scientific Association for further analysis, leading to a letter from Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton appearing in the Medical Record and stating the meat had been identified as lung tissue from either a horse or a human infant, \\"the structure of the organ in these two cases being almost identical.\\" The composition of this sample was backed up by further analysis, with two samples of the meat being identified as lung tissue, three as muscle, and two as cartilage. Brandeis's Nostoc theory relied on the fact that Nostoc expands into a clear jelly-like mass when rain falls on it, often giving the sense that it was falling with the rain. Charles Fort noted in his first book, The Book of the Damned, that there had been no rain. Locals favored the explanation that the meat was vomited up by buzzards, \\"who, as is their custom, seeing one of their companions disgorge himself, immediately followed suit.\\" Dr. L. D. Kastenbine presented this theory in the contemporaneous Louisville Medical News as the best explanation of the variety of meat. Vultures vomit as part of making a quick escape and also as a defensive method when threatened. Fort explained the flattened, dry appearance of the meat chunks as the result of pressure, and noted that nine days later, on March 12, 1876, red \\"corpuscles\\" with a \\"vegetable\\" appearance fell over London.Fort, pp. 288‚Äì89.

Harvard Biography Tlahuicole was regarded as the most formidable hero of his country, and commanded the Tlaxcaltec forces in the civil war in 1516 between the partisans of Cacamatzin and Ixtlilxochitl II. He was taken prisoner by stratagem and brought to the city of Mexico; but his bravery and character had made such an impression on Moctezuma II that he ordered the captive's release, an act that had no precedent in Mexican history. But Tlahuicole refused to profit by the monarch's generosity. He said to Montezuma that it would be infamous for him to return to his country after being conquered, and insisted on undergoing the fate of the other prisoners. Montezuma, wishing, at any cost, to save his life, offered him the command of an army about to be sent to drive back the Pur√©pechas, who had invaded his frontiers. Tlahuicole accepted Moctezuma's offer, hoping to meet a glorious death in the ensuing battle. He advanced at the head of the Mexican troops to the city Tangimoroa, called by the Mexicans Tlaximaloyan, cut through the Pur√©pecha army, which made a desperate resistance, and defeated them several times. He returned to Mexico, laden with spoils and accompanied by a long train of captives. Moctezuma lavished fresh honors on him, but failed to persuade him to accept the perpetual office of commander-in-chief or to return to his native country. He refused constantly, alleging that to do the first would be treason to his country, and to do the second would be a stain on his glory. At last Moctezuma consented to satisfy the desire of his general, and ordered him to be tied to the stone of the gladiators. He was armed in the usual fashion, and Moctezuma, with all his court, was present at the spectacle. Eight famous warriors of Anahuac attacked him one after the other, and were all disabled: the ninth, however, stunned him with a blow, and he was then put to death, with the customary ceremonies.

Description Looking south across the Mona Reservoir and Juab Valley, ca. 2000 The valley is in a region of dissected mountain ranges and valleys in the southern Wasatch Front, with the Wasatch Range on the northeast and the San Pitch Mountains on the southeast. The valley's north‚Äënortheast edge borders on the south of Utah Valley and another section of Utah Valley's southwest, the Goshen Valley. The eastern end of the northern border of Juab County is on the valley's north; the eastern end of the southern county is on the valley's southeast. Juab Valley is linear, mostly north-south trending, with the major city‚Äëcenter of Nephi adjacent north of the valley center. The extreme north of the valley is adjacent to Santaquin which is located between the three valleys of southwest Utah Valley, east Goshen Valley, and north Juab Valley. The valley's extreme southwest borders a hilly region on the Sevier River's northeast riverbank‚Äëshoreline and Yuba State Park-(Sevier Bridge Reservoir), a stretch of the Sevier that flows north, then northwest to west. The Juab Valley north-south center is south of Nephi, in the region of Sharp. Sage Valley Pass is located on the west in the West Hills that border the east of a small mountain valley (Sage Valley). The valley was named after the local Native Americans (Uabs, Yuabs, or Yoabs) of the Piute tribe. Creeks and reservoirs The valley has an east-west water divide, just north of Levan. The streams south of the divide are part of the Sevier River Basin and the streams north of the divide flow north out of the valley toward Utah Lake and are part of the basin of the Great Salt Lake. (Both basins are part of the Great Basin, a large endorheic watershed in the Western United States.) South valley While the southern part of the valley is part of the Sevier River basin, no streams flow directly into the Sevier River within the Juab Valley. Instead, they flow southwest out of the valley before emptying into the Sevier River. The Chicken Creek flows west out of the San Pitch Mountains (east of Levan). West of Levan it turns southwest then southerly into until it flows into the north end of the Chicken Creek Reservoir. The reservoir is located on the western edge of the valley, just north of the South Hills. The Chicken Creek flows out of the southwest corner of the reservoir and west out of the valley, by way of gap in the southern end of the West Hills. Fourmile Creek flows northwest out of the San Pitch mountains, about north of Chicken Creek, but entirely dissipates prior to reaching the Interstate 15 (I‚Äë15) corridor. About south of Levan, Little Salt Creek flows west out of San Pitch Mountains and then northwest to the Chicken Creek Reservoir. The Chriss Creek also flows west out of the San Pitch Mountains, about south-southwest of Levan, and then flows southwest across and out of the valley, south of the South Hills, on its way to the Sevier River. (In addition, Gardners Fork, Pigeon Creek, and Deep Creek, all flow west out of the San Pitch Mountains, but dissipate upon [or prior to] reaching the valley floor.) North valley The northern part of Juab Valley has Current Creek, which rises on the valley floor (rather than the adjacent mountains) and then flows north into the Mona Reservoir. Just before reaching the reservoir and just west of the Burriston Ponds, the Currant Creek receives the West Creek (which flows northerly out of the West Hills). After leaving the west side of the Mona Reservoir, the Current Creek flows northwest out of the valley, through Goshen Canyon and on to Utah Lake. In addition, the Willow, Mona, North, and Mendenhall creeks all flow west out of the Wasatch Range, but dissipate shortly after reaching the valley floor. Populated places The following communities are located within the Juab Valley: * Juab (unincorporated community) * Levan (town) * Mona (city) * Nephi (city) * Rocky Ridge (town) * Starr (unincorporated community) Transportation Airports The only airport in the valley is the Nephi Municipal Airport, which is located about northwest of the downtown area of Nephi. Being a general aviation municipal airport, no commercial passenger service is available. Railroad The Union Pacific Railroad (UP) operates a set of railroad tracks that run the length of the valley. The line enters the valley through a gap the West Hills (alongside Chicken Creek), just southwest of the Chicken Creek Reservoir. Running east of, but roughly parallel to I‚Äë15, they continue north to pass under the freeway at a point just southwest of Nephi. Continuing north, the tracks run west of, but again roughly parallel to, I‚Äë15\\\\. After passing by the western edges of both Nephi and Mona, the tracks leave the north end of the valley. There are no train stations or rail yards within the valley, but there are sidings in Juab, about north-northeast of Juab, and in Nephi. There are also two very short branch lines (spurs), one in Nephi (for UP) and the other about south-southwest of Nephi (for Intermountain Farmers Association's South Region Feed Mill). Roads Northbound on Interstate 15 near Mona, August 2012 There is one Interstate Highway and four state highways in Juab Valley. Interstate 15 (I‚Äë15) enters the southwestern edge of the valley (just southwest of the Chicken Creek Reservoir) and runs north along the foothills on western edge of the valley. Just south of Nephi, the Interstate crosses over to the east side of the valley and continues north along the eastern foothills until it leaves the valley on its northern end. Utah State Route 132 enters the valley from the West Hills and then runs easterly, through Nephi, before exiting the east side of the valley (between the Wasatch Range and the San Pitch Mountains). Utah State Route 28 enters the southern end of the valley and runs north, mostly along the eastern foothills, until it ends at an interchange with I‚Äë15, just north of Nephi. Utah State Route 78 begins at an interchange with I‚Äë15, immediately southwest of the Chicken Creek Reservoir, and then runs north‚Äënortheasterly and then east until it end ends at a junction with SR‚Äë28 in Levan. Utah State Route 54 begins at Main Street in Mona and runs easterly to end at interchange with I‚Äë15\\\\. In addition to the Interstate and state highways, the former routing of U.S. Route 91 (known now as Old Highway 91) runs north from SR‚Äë28 (north of Nephi and just southwest of the I‚Äë15/SR‚Äë28 interchange) through Mona and exits the north end of valley, immediately west of I‚Äë15\\\\. The Goshen Canyon Road runs west from Mona, past the south end of the Mona Reservoir, and then north-northwest to leave the valley through Goshen Canyon.

F. Fahroo and I. M. Ross, Pseudospectral Methods for Infinite Horizon Nonlinear Optimal Control Problems, AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference, August 15‚Äì18, 2005, San Francisco, CA. Overview The Ross‚ÄìFahroo methods are based on shifted Gaussian pseudospectral node points. The shifts are obtained by means of a linear or nonlinear transformation while the Gaussian pseudospectral points are chosen from a collection of Gauss- Lobatto or Gauss-Radau distribution arising from Legendre or Chebyshev polynomials. The Gauss-Lobatto pseudospectral points are used for finite- horizon optimal control problems while the Gauss-Radau pseudospectral points are used for infinite-horizon optimal control problems. Mathematical applications The Ross‚ÄìFahroo methods are founded on the Ross‚ÄìFahroo lemma; they can be applied to optimal control problems governed by differential equations, differential-algebraic equations, differential inclusions, and differentially-flat systems. They can also be applied to infinite-horizon optimal control problems by a simple domain transformation technique. The Ross‚ÄìFahroo pseudospectral methods also form the foundations for the Bellman pseudospectral method. Flight applications and awards The Ross‚ÄìFahroo methods have been implemented in many practical applications and laboratories around the world. In 2006, NASA used the Ross‚ÄìFahroo method to implement the \\"zero propellant maneuver\\" on board the International Space Station.N. S. Bedrossian, S. Bhatt, W. Kang, and I. M.

In recognition of all these advances, the AIAA presented Ross and Fahroo, the 2010 Mechanics and Control of Flight Award, for \\"... changing the landscape of flight mechanics.\\" Ross was also elected AAS Fellow for \\"his pioneering contributions to pseudospectral optimal control.\\" Distinctive features A remarkable feature of the Ross‚ÄìFahroo methods is that it does away with the prior notions of \\"direct\\" and \\"indirect\\" methods.

This implied that one could use their methods as simply as a \\"direct\\" method while automatically generating accurate duals as in \\"indirect\\" methods. This revolutionized solving optimal control problems leading to widespread use of the Ross‚ÄìFahroo techniques.Q. Gong, W. Kang, N. Bedrossian, F. Fahroo, P. Sekhavat and K.

Education Maria Richards Oakey, The Philosopher's Corner, 1873, High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GeorgiaMaria Oakey Dewing, A Bed of Poppies, 1909, Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, MassachusettsMaria Oakey Dewing, Portrait of Dr. Charles Carroll Lee, 1914 She first attended the Cooper Union School of Design in 1866, studying there until 1870 with William Rimmer, Edwin Forbes, Robert Swain Gifford and George Edmund Butler. There, she took classes with her friend Helena de Kay. From 1871 to 1875 she studied at the Antique School of National Academy of Fine Arts,Carol Kort; Liz Sonneborn. A to Z of American Women in the Visual Arts. Infobase Publishing; 1 January 2002. . p. 54. during which time she shared an apartment with de Kay and took painting lessons from the painter John La Farge. He specialized in Japanese aesthetics and was said by Dewing to have created paintings that were \\"the most beautiful in all the world\\" and greatly influenced her own work. As a student she had already begun to gain a reputation as a capable painter, her works attracted \\"much attention for its broad, vigorous brush work, and rich, glowing color\\" and were exhibited at the National Academy of Design. She studied with John La Farge, and her work was influenced by La Farge's fascination with Japanese aesthetics. In 1875, Oakey and other students from the academy left to establish the now renowned Art Students League of New York. The same year her works were exhibited at a show organized in New York by La Farge and she studied with landscape artist William Morris Hunt and in 1876 with Thomas Couture. Career Art Maria and her husband spent the summers from 1885 to 1905 at the Cornish Art Colony in New Hampshire. There both of the Dewings were avid gardeners, an activity that Maria believed was important to paint nature and inspired her floral paintings. She said, \\"The flower offers a removed beauty that exists only for beauty, more abstract than it can be in a human being, even more exquisite.\\" Garden in May made in 1895, Bed of Poppies made in 1909 and Iris at Dawn are among her most well-known paintings. In 1921 art critic Edwin Bye said her flower paintings were \\"absolutely unique\\" and William H. Gerdts said in 1942 that her \\"flower paintings combine a poetic sensibility derived from her teacher, John La Farge, with a thorough knowledge of botany nourished and enhanced by the cultivation of her own garden.\\" It is also possible that she changed in order to focus her artistic effort in a different direction Dewing created embroidered applique pieces that were like tapestries in the early 1880s. In 1886 Dewing and her husband worked together on the painting Hymen, which was signed by both of them, and she also painted floral portions of other paintings for him, but without her signature. Dewing exhibited her work at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois and at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, where she won bronze medals. In 1907 a solo exhibition of 22 of her flower and figure paintings was held at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She began making figure paintings again later in life. Her patrons during her career included Charles Lang Freer, Whitelaw Reid and John Gellatly. In her lifetime, her works were compared to French painters Antoine Vollon, Henri Fantin-Latour and John La Farge. Wistful that as a wife of a successful figure painter she had not realized her full potential, Dewing said in the later years of her career, \\"I have hardly touched any achievement... I dreamed of groups and figures in big landscapes and I still see them.\\" Dewing was an early convert to Modernism, and in an article published in Art and Progress in 1915 she wrote: ‚ÄúThe flower offers a removed beauty that exists only for beauty, more abstract than it can be in the human being, even more exquisite. One may begin with the human figure at the logical and realistic, but in painting the flower one must even begin at the exquisite and distinguished.‚Äù Writer Dewing wrote books and articles about keeping house, etiquette and painting, the articles about art were published in Art and Progress and the American Magazine of Art. Her works included the following, written from the perspective of an artist: * Beauty in Dress. New York, Harper & Brothers, 1881. * Beauty in the Household.

Early years  James Croak was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1951. His mother died at the age of two. At the age of 15 he was a recognized musical prodigy and studied under Andr√©s Segovia, the virtuoso Spanish classical guitarist. At the age of sixteen he gave a series of concerts as a part of the 1968 Summer Olympic Games in Mexico City. Following his high school education, Croak attended the Ecumenical Institute in Chicago studying philosophy, and studied sculpture concurrently at the University of Illinois at Chicago graduating in 1974.  Professional life  James Croak's Pegasus Some Loves, an example of his combination of taxidermy and found objects, was created in 1983. James Croak's Dirt Baby, an example of his dirt sculpture, was created in 2000. James Croak's Dirt Man with Shovel, an example of his dirt sculpture, was created in 1996. Croak received a National Endowment for the Arts artist-in-residence grant in 1976. At this point much of his work was done with the medium of aluminum in a method similar to that of Frank Stella, although Croak is believed to have developed his personal technique himself. Later that year he moved his work to the abandoned Fire Station Number 23 in Los Angeles, California, where his work became less abstract and more figural. After eight years he moved to Brooklyn, New York. Croak's work was featured in Thomas C. McEvilley's book Sculpture in the Age of Doubt, and also in a book dedicated entirely to Croak's work entitled James Croak, published by the same author. In 2011 he was featured at the Wellcome Collection in London, UK as a part of an exhibition entitled \\"Dirt\\". The work exhibited was designed to cause a strong emotional reaction in the onlooker: a review of his work at this show by The Guardian newspaper's art critic Laura Cumming stated that, \\"It would be hard to overstate the physical effect of James Croak's‚Ä¶ sculpture\\". The sculpture was an example of his \\"dirt sculpture\\" technique, which employs a mixture of binder and different kinds of dirt, dust, and soil. According to the artist, the material was developed out of necessity, stating that in 1985, \\"I wanted to cast a full-size self‚Äìportrait, but I couldn't afford bronze, so I walked down the street to an empty lot, dug up dirt, put it in a wheelbarrow, took it home, mixed it with glue, and pressed it into the plaster mold.\\" He has also been known to work with found objects and taxidermy. A twenty-year retrospective of his work was held in 1998 at the Contemporary Art Center of Virginia. The transition from aluminum to dirt as a medium gave his work a harder and rougher feel than his prior works. In each medium Croak has designed his works in a series. Some examples of his series include the Dirt Man series, the Dirt Baby series, and the Dirt Window series. Croak is also a published writer, with essays appearing in the books This Will Make You Smarter: New Scientific Concepts to Improve Your Thinking and Is the Internet Changing the Way you Think?: The Net's Impact on our Minds and Future, both edited by John Brockman. An additional essay was published in the book Afterwords, a compilation put together by Salon.com featuring the works of its contributors, which Croak has been one on occasion. He is also an online contributor and conference participant to the non-profit intellectual organization Edge.org, the membership of which is composed of highly accomplished thinkers in both the arts and sciences from different corners of the world. His works are also available at the website Artnet. According to art critic Carlos Suarez de Jesus, themes involved in Croak's work often include death, social instability, and the finite nature of human life. Another recurring theme in his work is ancient mythology. In addition, James Croak is an avid pilot and has an American commercial pilot license.  Dirt sculpture  Croak's dirt sculpture technique goes as follows. First a model is selected and photographed from many different angles. The photograph is then dressed with a grid in order to allow for accurate size referencing. Second, an armature is created from steel and aluminum that is strong enough to support two hundred pounds of clay. Third, the clay is sculpted in the presence of the model over the span of more than one hundred hours in order to replicate the model's body as precisely as possible. Fourth, smaller and more minute details like the face are refined. Fifth, the sculpture is then cut into pieces and a two layer mold (a rubber layer and a plaster layer) is made from those pieces. Sixth, Croak digs up or acquires a large amount of dirt and dries it with the aid of large fans. Seventh, Croak mixes the dirt with a binder, then pours the mixture into the mold. Eighth, once set, the pieces of the sculpture are then reassembled and glued together with the same dirt and binder mixture with which they were created. His dirt sculptures have appeared in over twenty-five published books.

Life  His father was related to the princely Starhemberg family and served as an Economic Councilor. He seems to have been an indifferent student, but he did show an interest in art so, in 1845, he was enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna for a brief stay, then studied privately with Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller and Carl Rahl. From 1847 to 1855, before completing his studies, he became an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Common Army and served as a cuirassier in the Hungarian Campaign.\\"Hans Canon\\" in the Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich, Zamarski, Vienna (1879) Vol.39 Young Woman with Parrot (1876) His later service in the artillery appears to have provided inspiration for the name \\"Canon\\" (although the word may have other meanings), which he began using after Slavic names became a handicap, due to the various separatist movements active in the Empire at that time. After his obligations and studies were over, he travelled to England, France, Italy (which, unlike most Northern Europeans of the time, he did not find attractive) and the Middle East. Upon his return, he accompanied Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek (who was not only a patron of the arts, but an explorer as well) on a trip to London to help purchase animals for the Sch√∂nbrunn Zoo. From 1860 to 1869, he lived in Karlsruhe then, after getting married, moved to Stuttgart where he stayed until 1874, when the success of his paintings at the Vienna World's Fair (one was purchased by the Emperor) induced him to return home. In 1875, his connections with Wilczek earned him a major commission to portray the men and vessels of the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition, for which task he went to Fiume, working from the original subjects and photographs. He went on to specialize in portraits, including many members of the royal family. The Circle of Life (1883-1885) In addition to his canvases, he created a series of monumental paintings in several public buildings on or near the Ringstra√üe. The best known of these is the colossal \\"Circle of Life\\", in the Vienna Natural History Museum. A further commission for the museum was cut short when he died suddenly, apparently from an aortic dissection. He is buried in the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery. In 1891, a street was named after him in the Favoriten district of Vienna. A commemorative postage stamp with his portrait was issued by the Austrian Post in 1948.

Three civilians were killed and 185 people were injured. No group ever claimed responsibility for the attacks and nobody was ever charged in connection with the bombings. The first bombing in Burgh Quay may have been carried out by former associates of the Littlejohn brothers who were Secret Intelligence Service provocateurs,Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 30‚Äì33 in a successful attempt to provoke an Irish government clampdown against the Provisional IRA, while the other three bombings were possibly perpetrated by loyalist paramilitaries, specifically the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), with British military or intelligence assistance. The UVF claimed in 1993 to have carried out the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings which incurred the greatest loss of life in a single day throughout the 30-year conflict known as the Troubles. On 1 December 1972, when two separate car bombs exploded in Eden Quay and Sackville Place, D√°il √âireann was debating a bill to amend the Offences Against the State Act which would enact stricter measures against the Provisional IRA and other paramilitary groups. As a result of the two bombings, which killed two men and wounded 131, the D√°il voted for the amendment, which introduced special emergency powers to combat the IRA. It is believed that the 26 November and 1 December bombings were executed to influence the outcome of the voting. Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron commissioned an official inquiry into the bombings. The findings were published in a report in November 2004. Background The bombings in Dublin occurred at the end of what was the bloodiest year in the entire 30-year-old religious-political conflict known as the Troubles, which had erupted at the end of the 1960s.Houses of errythe Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin Bombings of 1972 and 1972, November 2004 (The Second Barron Report 2004), p. 10 Retrieved 24 January 2012 Following the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry on 30 January 1972 when the British Army's Parachute Regiment shot dead 14 unarmed Catholic civilians during an anti-internment demonstration, a torrent of anti-British sentiment was unleashed in Ireland and beyond. An angry crowd in Dublin attacked the British embassy and burnt it to the ground. The Official IRA responded with the 1972 Aldershot Bombing in England, at the headquarters of the Parachute Regiment. This attack killed seven civilians.Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 10‚Äì11 In retaliation for the shootings in Derry, the Provisional IRA escalated its armed campaign with a series of bombings across Northern Ireland which led to a high number of civilian casualties. Four days after the Donegall Street bombing in central Belfast on 20 March which killed seven people, British Prime Minister Edward Heath announced the suspension of the 50-year-old Stormont parliament and the imposition of Direct Rule from London. This caused Ulster loyalists and unionists throughout Northern Ireland to feel profoundly angry, shocked, and betrayed; moreover, they considered it to have been another \\"sign of continuing Government weakness in the face of IRA violence\\".Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.pp.98‚Äì99 On 29 May, the Official IRA declared a ceasefire, this was followed on 27 June by the Provisional IRA also declaring a ceasefire which loyalists regarded with suspicion, fearing it would lead to the British Government doing a secret deal resulting in a united Ireland.Taylor, p.106 Representatives of the IRA and British Government held unprecedented secret talks in England, but these proved unsuccessful and the Provisional IRA's ceasefire ended in early July after a confrontation with the British Army in Belfast. When the IRA exploded 22 bombs across Belfast in what became known as Bloody Friday, many Ulster Protestants, after seeing the televised carnage of victims' remains being scraped off the street and poured into plastic bags, rushed to join paramilitary organisations such as the legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA) or the illegal Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).Taylor, pp. 106‚Äì108 The bombings also led the British Army to launch Operation Motorman, which saw the arrival of an addition 4,000 troops to assist in the recapture of the mostly IRA-controlled \\"no-go areas\\" in Belfast and Derry. The dismantling of these \\"no-go\\" areas, which had been set up by residents in certain nationalist/republican districts to prevent access by the security forces, effectively prohibited the IRA from enjoying the same operational freedom it had known prior to the implementation of Operation Motorman.The Second Barron Report 2004, p.11 The UVF was led by Gusty Spence, who was imprisoned since 1966 for a sectarian murder. In July 1972, his associates on the outside staged a fake kidnapping while Spence was on bail and he was at liberty for four months. During this period he organised the UVF into brigades, battalions, companies and platoons. These were all subordinate to the Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) based on the loyalist Shankill Road. He also managed to obtain an arsenal of sophisticated guns and ammunition after a raid on King's Park camp, an Ulster Defence Regiment/Territorial Army depot in Lurgan by an armed UVF gang. The UVF also stole twenty tons of ammonium nitrate from the Belfast Docks.Taylor, pp. 111‚Äì112 During the spring and summer of 1972, the UDA set up barricades and no-go areas in Belfast and paraded through the city centre in a massive show of strength.Taylor, p. 104. William Craig, leader of the Unionist Vanguard movement, addressed a meeting of right-wing MPs in Westminster who belonged to the Monday Club on 19 October during which he claimed he could mobilise 80,000 men who \\"are prepared to come out and shoot and kill\\". On 28 October a bomb was found in Dublin's busy Connolly Station and fire-bombs detonated inside four Dublin hotels.The Second Barron Report 2004, p.12 On 4 November Spence was recaptured in Belfast by the British Army. The Irish Government began its clampdown against the IRA in that same year. On 19 November the Provisional IRA's Chief of Staff, Sean MacStiofain was arrested in Dublin and immediately went on a hunger and thirst strike.The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 16 The same month, a controversial amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, giving the Garda S√≠och√°na special powers to deal with the IRA and other subversives was brought before D√°il √âireann.The Second Barron Report, p. 17 Keith and Kenneth Littlejohn On 12 October 1972, an armed gang executed what was at the time the biggest bank robbery in Irish history. The robbery was carried out at the Allied Irish Bank's Grafton Street branch and the gang made off with ¬£67,000. Four days later, Garda officers raided the Drumcondra residence of two Englishmen, brothers Kenneth and Keith Littlejohn where they recovered ¬£11,000 of the sum taken. The brothers were arrested in England on 19 October and were flown to Ireland in March 1973 following the issuing of an extradition warrant from Dublin. Prior to and during their trial, the brothers claimed to be MI6/Official IRA double-agents who were introduced to the British security forces by Pamela Dillon, Lady Onslow, the Anglo-Irish ex-wife of William Onslow, 6th Earl of Onslow. She had become acquainted with Keith Littlejohn through her work with the ex-Borstal organisation \\"Teamwork Associates\\" in London.The Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 12‚Äì13 Keith Littlejohn had spent time in Borstal, whilst Kenneth had served a prison sentence from 1965 to 1968 for robbery. During an encounter with Lady Onslow, Keith told her that his brother Kenneth \\"had information about arms and sources of arms for the IRA which might be of interest to Her Majesty's Government.

She passed on Keith Littlejohn's words to her friend, Lord Carrington, the Secretary of State for Defence. A meeting took place between Kenneth Littlejohn and the Under Secretary of State for Defence, Geoffrey Johnson Smith, at her London flat on 22 November 1971. After Littlejohn had told Johnson Smith what he knew about the IRA, Johnson Smith then put him in \\"touch with the appropriate authorities\\". The Littlejohns claimed they were ordered to infiltrate the Official IRA and after this was accomplished, they were instructed by the British Ministry of Defence to act as agent provocateurs by carrying out robberies and other acts of violence in the Republic of Ireland to provoke the Irish Government into taking a stronger stance against the IRA and other republican subversives. The Ministry of Defence issued a statement acknowledging to having met Kenneth Littlejohn once to discuss information he had in his possession regarding the IRA but denied that he had worked for the Ministry and denied British Government involvement in the Dublin bank robbery. The Official IRA, while admitting to having been acquainted with the Littlejohns after the brothers arrived in Newry in 1972, denied the brothers had ever been members of the OIRA. The Littlejohns were found guilty of bank robbery on 3 August 1973 and sentenced to imprisonment; Kenneth received 20 years and Keith 15 years. The brothers escaped from Dublin's Mountjoy Prison in 1974.\\"1974: 'Anti-IRA spies break out of jail'\\", BBC.

Retrieved 24 January 2012 The bombings 26 November 1972, Burgh Quay The first of the four bombs exploded on Sunday 26 November 1972 at 1.25 a.m. outside the rear exit door of the Film Centre Cinema, O'Connell Bridge House during a late night showing of a film. The bomb went off in the laneway connecting Burgh Quay with Leinster Market injuring 40 people, some very badly, including facial, leg and serious bowel wounds. There were 156 patrons and three employees inside the cinema at the time of the blast, although were no fatalities.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 23. The force of the explosion hurled customers out of their seats and onto the floor. There was much panic as people, fearing a second bomb would explode in their midst, rushed to escape from the crowded cinema. Shops and buildings in the immediate vicinity received extensive damage. The area was sealed off by the Garda and they launched an investigation; a ballistic officer determined that the explosion's epicentre had been on a doorstep outside an emergency door leading to the laneway. However, no trace of the bomb or explosives used were ever found at the scene. The Garda√≠ interviewed a number of witnesses who came forward alleging to have seen the bombers in the laneway prior to the explosion and although photofits of the suspects were drawn up, the bombers were never apprehended.Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 24‚Äì25 The Garda S√≠och√°na believed the bombing was carried out by republican subversives, including former associates of the Littlejohn brothers. The night following the bombing an eight-man IRA unit unsuccessfully tried to free MacStiofain, who had been taken to Dublin's Mater Hospital for treatment due to adverse effects of his hunger and thirst strike on his health. The ward in which he was kept was under heavy police guard. The armed IRA unit exchanged shots with two members of the Garda Special Branch; one detective, two civilians and one of the IRA gang suffered minor injuries from gunfire. 1 December 1972, Eden Quay and Sackville Place Eden Quay as it appeared in 1998 On Friday, 1 December 1972 at 19:58 a blue Hillman Avenger, registration number OGX 782 K, exploded at 29 Eden Quay close to Liberty Hall tower block.Second Barron Report, 2004. p.35 The blast blew the Avenger apart and what remained of the vehicle was catapulted 18 feet away to rest outside an optician's office. A wall of flame shot up which was visible to people across the Liffey river on the opposite Burgh Quay. Six cars parked in the vicinity of the Avenger were set on fire, and piled on top of each other; most of the windows of Liberty Hall and other nearby buildings imploded and the edifices were damaged. Although a number of people suffered injuries ‚Äì some horrific ‚Äì nobody was killed. One of the injured included a pregnant woman. Customers inside the quayside \\"Liffey Bar\\", near the explosion's epicentre, were hurt by flying glass and some had open head wounds.\\"A grim night of death and destruction by the Liffey\\". Irish Independent. Eddie Naughton. 22 November 2009 Retrieved 24 January 2010 Following the explosion, a huge crowd of people hurried to the scene where police and ambulances had already arrived.Second Barron Report, 2004. p. 36 At exactly the same time the carbomb detonated in Eden Quay, the Belfast Newsletter received a telephone call from a man using a coin box speaking with a \\"Belfast English\\" type of accent. He issued a warning that two bombs would explode in Dublin. He gave the locations as Liberty Hall and Abbey Street behind Clerys department store. The newspaper immediately phoned the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), who in turn relayed the warnings to the Garda Control Room Dublin Castle at 20:08. A team of Garda√≠ were sent to investigate the area around Sackville Place and Earl Street. A policeman ran into a CI√â company canteen in Earl Place warning the employees inside to clear the building as there was a bomb scare. Just after the building was evacuated, at 20:16 a silver-grey Ford Escort, registration number 955 1VZ, exploded in Sackville Place 40 feet away from its intersection with Marlborough Street, throwing people up in the air and in all directions, killing two CI√â employees who moments before had left the canteen. The victims were George Bradshaw (30), a bus driver and Thomas Duffy (23), a bus conductor. Both men were married with children. Bradshaw, whose body was rendered unrecognisable by the effects of the blast, died of severe head injuries and Duffy was killed by a flying metal fragment which had lacerated his aorta. Henry Kilduff, a CI√â bus driver later told Garda√≠ that he had seen Bradshaw and Duffy 10 or 20 yards away walking down Sackville Place towards Marlborough Street when the carbomb exploded beside them. Denis Gibney, another co-worker, informed police that Bradshaw had been headed in the direction of Liberty Hall after hearing that a bomb had gone off near there. Bradshaw was found lying badly mangled beside a damaged car and was carried into a ruined shop front where a priest performed last rites. As at Eden Quay, the Sackville Place bombing caused considerable damage to buildings and vehicles near the blast's epicentre. Sackville Place is a narrow street off O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare. There was further panic amongst the survivors when the petrol tank inside the burning bomb car exploded.The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 37 A total of 131 people were injured in both explosions.The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 6 The two bombings had immediate political ramifications. Just as the bombs were exploding in the city centre, D√°il √âireann was debating the controversial bill to amend the Offences Against the State Act, which would enact stricter measures against the Provisional IRA and other paramilitary groups. As a result of the two attacks, the D√°il voted for the amendment which introduced special emergency powers to combat the IRA. In particular this meant that a member of the IRA or any other paramilitary group could be sentenced on the sworn evidence of a senior Garda officer in front of three judges. Before the bombings, many commentators had actually believed the bill ‚Äì considered by some to be 'draconian' ‚Äì would be defeated.CAIN: Events: Dublin and Monaghan bombings: Chronology of Events Retrieved 23 January 2012 Thirteen days after the double-bombing, three incendiary devices were found in Dublin ‚Äì one inside Clerys department store and the other two in the toilets of the \\"Premier Bar\\" in Sackville Place. The devices had failed to explode. According to journalists Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald, the devices were planted by the same UVF bomb unit that was responsible for the Eden Quay and Sackville Place car bombs.Cusack, Jim & McDonald, Henry (1997). UVF. Poolbeg. p.121 20 January 1973, Sackville Place Sackville Place, as viewed from O'Connell Street, January 2012 On Saturday 20 January 1973 at 15:08, a male caller with an English accent rang the telephone exchange in Exchequer Street, Dublin, with the following bomb warning: \\"Listen love, there is a bomb in O'Connell Street at the Bridge\\". Although the call was placed from a coin box in the Dublin area, the exact location was never determined. The telephonist immediately contacted the Garda S√≠och√°na.The Second Barron Report 2004, p.70 The streets of central Dublin were more crowded than usual as Ireland was playing the All Blacks at an international rugby match being held that afternoon in Lansdowne Road.The Troubles: A Chronology of the Northern Ireland Conflict magazine. Issue #19, January‚ÄìFebruary 1973. Glenravel publications. p. 29. At 15:18, a man leaving Kilmartin's betting shop in Sackville Place noticed smoke or steam emanating from the boot of a red Vauxhall Victor car parked outside Egan's pub facing the direction of O'Connell Street. Its registration number was EOI 1229. About five seconds later the bomb inside the red car's boot exploded, scattering sections of the vehicle and throwing the man to his feet. The explosion was so powerful that it hurled the car's roof over adjacent Abbey Street where it landed in Harbour Place; the right hand rear hub and axle sections were blasted through a metal grill on a shop window.\\"'Nitrate bomb' caused explosion, Inquest\\". Irish News. 26 February 2005 A CI√â bus conductor, 21-year-old Thomas Douglas, originally from Stirling, Scotland, was passing the betting shop just as the bomb went off and the force of the blast hurled him through a shop front window where he died minutes later of shock and h√¶morrhage from the multiple injuries he received in the explosion. The entire shop front was devastated and spattered with blood.\\"Sackville widow: 'No rest till we get truth'\\". The Mirror (London). Stewart MacLean. 23 February 2005. Fourteen people were badly injured in the bombing which caused bedlam as hysterical Saturday afternoon shoppers sought to flee the area in panic and confusion. The carbomb detonated at almost the exact location of 1 December bomb. Later eyewitness accounts suggested it had been parked at the kerb several hours before it exploded.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 98 According to journalists Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald in their book UVF, the bomb was designed to cause widespread chaos and alarm throughout the city, and to inflict massive injuries upon shoppers and pedestrians as Saturday has traditionally been the busiest shopping day of the week for Dubliners.Cusack, Jim & McDonald, Henry (1997). UVF. Poolbeg. p. 123 Garda investigation No paramilitary organisation claimed responsibility for any of the bombings. The two bomb sites at Eden Quay and Sackville Place were carefully examined by members of the Garda Ballistics, Mapping, Fingerprint and Photographic sections. An Irish Army EOD officer was also part of the team. They first examined the wreckage of the bomb cars and craters left by the blasts. It was suggested that the explosives used in both attacks were of the Chlorate or Nitrate type. The concentration of blast damage to the rear section of both vehicles suggested that the bombs were placed in either the boots or behind the back seats. It was determined that timing devices were used in both the Eden Quay and the Sackville Place bombings.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 49 Garda Detective Sergeant Eamon √ì Fiach√°in, the head deputy of the Ballistics Section of the Garda Technical Bureau had been inside Eason's Book Shop in O'Connell Street when the bomb went off on 20 January. He immediately rushed to the scene in Sackville Place and made an examination of the area. As he measured the distance of the crater and inspected the damage done to the surrounding buildings, he discovered that the wreckage of the bomb car had been moved from the exact spot where it had detonated to allow the passage of Fire Brigade engines and ambulance workers to remove the dead and injured. Upon close inspection of the car, the section showing the greatest blast intensity led him to judge that the centre of the explosion took place on the driver's side in the rear of the vehicle, between the boot and the rear of the rear bench seat. He suggested the explosion itself was caused by a nitrate bomb. Among the debris he found a fragment of a test tube with traces of a white crystalline deposit. It was taken for analysis.The Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 73‚Äì74 The wreckage of the bomb car was also conveyed to the Garda Depot for technical examination. No conclusion was ever drawn as to the composition of the three bombs at Eden Quay and Sackville Place.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 90 The bomb cars Regarding the two bomb cars which exploded on 1 December 1972, Garda investigators in Belfast discovered that both vehicles had been hired in that city on 30 November 1972 by a man aged about 40 using the stolen driver's licence in the name of Joseph Fleming with an address in Derby, England.The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 38 It transpired that Fleming's car had been stolen from a carpark in Ballymoney, County Antrim on 11 August 1972 and his documents including the driving licence had been taken as well. The Garda S√≠och√°na was satisfied that Fleming had had nothing to do with the two bombings. Descriptions of the man who hired the Ford Escort at Moley's car hire firm in Belfast's Victoria Square at 9.00 a.m. were provided.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 39 His accent was described as having been that of a cultured Englishman or a Belfast man who had spent time in England.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 40 The same man hired the Avenger at 11:30 from Avis car rentals at Aldergrove Airport. As with Moley's, the man used the Fleming driver's licence and paid with English bank notes rather than notes issued by banks in Northern Ireland. Police also discovered that Fleming's licence had been used on other occasions to hire cars. These other vehicles may have been scouting and getaway cars for the bombing team.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 41 The Vauxhall Victor had been hired at noon on 19 January 1973 from Belfast Car Hire (Inc.) in Grovenor Road. The following morning at 08:30 as the hirer was driving along Agnes Street, off the Shankill Road, it was hijacked by two men. He was taken away by the hijackers and held hostage inside a building until 15:00 After receiving instructions by the hijackers to report the car theft to the Tennent Street RUC station, the man was deposited at the junction of Twaddell Avenue and Ballygomartin Road. At 15:20, he walked inside the RUC station as instructed where he made a statement to the police regarding the hijacking.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 71 The Garda S√≠och√°na interviewed a number of witnesses who had seen the bomb cars at various locations in the Dublin area and en route. The original Northern Ireland registration plates had been retained on all three vehicles. The eyewitnesses gave descriptions of the cars' drivers and passengers which were used to make up photofits.Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 42‚Äì45 The timing of the sightings of the cars used in the 1 December attacks indicated that the bombers had driven the vehicles down to Dublin on 30 November.The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 47 A Garda standing outside the Drogheda Garda station on 20 January had registered all the vehicles with Northern Ireland and English registration plates. He had noted down the registration number of the red Vauxhall as it passed through Drogheda heading south towards Dublin at about 12:12; although he hadn't taken notice of the driver's appearance nor observed whether there were any passengers inside. The cars preceding and following the Vauxhall were subsequently traced, but their occupants were found to have had no connection to the Dublin attacks.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 72 The suspects' photofits were circulated around hotels, guesthouses as well as bus, rail, air and train termini ‚Äì all possible places where the suspects may have been observed.The Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 47‚Äì48 A photofit of the man who hired the cars in Belfast was passed on by Garda√≠ to the British Defence Forces.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 48 The Garda enquiries did not yield results and the bombers were never apprehended. No one has ever been charged in connection with the bombings. Allegations The Ulster Volunteer Force Suspicion initially fell on the Provisional IRA and other republican groups.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 95Moloney, Ed (2010). Voices From the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland. US: Faber & Faber. p.341 Shortly afterwards, however the blame shifted to loyalist paramilitary organisations, in particular, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 99 Garda√≠ received a telephone call from a male caller in Belfast who gave the names of five men whom he claimed were responsible for 20 January carbomb. The caller said that the five men were originally from Belfast's Sailortown area but had since relocated to new housing estates in the city. It is not known what action, if any, was ever undertaken by the Garda S√≠och√°na to follow up this telephone call.The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 76 On 3 February 1973, a Garda Inspector informed the Superintendent of B District, Dublin that he had received confidential information from a reliable source confirming that 1 December and 20 January bombings had been perpetrated by the UVF.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 58 This source provided the following information specifically regarding 20 January attack: \\"A young man named from the Shankill Road area of Belfast planted the last car bomb in Sackville Place. This man should not be confused with ... who is one of the leaders of the UDA organisation in Belfast\\".The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 77 This pertinent information was passed on to the RUC. The latter sent a reply back to the Garda√≠ on 12 April 1973 claiming to have \\"no hard evidence\\" on the perpetrators of the Dublin bombings. It continued to state: \\"We do have two persons named...from the area you mention who are believed to have UVF connections. They are fairly seasoned, the younger of the two being 40 years of age and I note you describe the person as being a young man...\\" The UVF have never admitted responsibility for the bombings as they later did for the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan explosions. British Army Intelligence There were strong allegations that British Army Intelligence assisted the loyalists in carrying out the bombings, as part of a covert operation to influence the outcome of the voting in the D√°il regarding the amendment to the Offences Against the State Act. A Dublin taxi driver made a statement to the Garda√≠ on the morning of 2 December regarding a passenger he picked up in Lower Baggot Street at 2.20 a.m. The passenger had a military-style haircut and spoke with an English accent. He first asked to be driven to the bomb sites and then wished to be driven north to Derry for the sum of ¬£40. The driver agreed and they headed north. They were stopped at a Garda checkpoint at Slane and both men were questioned; when the Garda asked the passenger his name he replied \\"Major Glover\\", giving an address in London, and informed the policeman he was going to Enniskillen Barracks. During the course of the journey the man claimed he was a Major in British Intelligence and told the taxi driver that the bombings were carried out by MI5, adding that there were British soldiers in disguise in Dublin. The man also warned him that the \\"might of the British Army would cause more bombs in Dublin\\".Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 64‚Äì67 Upon reaching Enniskillen, the taxi driver was ordered down a dead-end road and the passenger told him if he wanted to get out alive he was to hand over all his money. After the frightened driver did as he was instructed he let the passenger off outside the Enniskillen RUC barracks and quickly drove back to Dublin. On 15 August 1973, at the Dundalk horse races, the taxi driver recognised the man and told a Garda Sergeant who arrested him. It emerged that the Englishman, who frequently visited Dublin, was mentally unstable with a criminal record for indecent behaviour and assaults against the police. His name was not Glover, he had never served with the British Armed Forces and there was no evidence to connect him with any of the bombings in Dublin. An anonymous letter was sent to the editor of the Irish Times on 7 December 1972, six days after the double-bombing; it claimed that > The bomb explosions in Dublin were not the result of action by the IRA, UDR, > UVF or any other farcical Irish organisation. Five members of the British > Armed Forces were involved and they left Dublin not by car or train to > Ulster but by plane to HeathrowSecond Barron Report 2004, p. 55 The sender of the letter was never traced. A copy of the letter and envelope in which it was sent was attached to the Garda investigation report. On 18 December 1972, an Englishman named John Wyman was arrested under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1963 and sent to Dublin's Bridewell Garda station for questioning. It was discovered that he was an agent working for British Intelligence services and had inveigled Detective Garda Patrick Crinnion from C3 Branch into providing him with classified Garda documents containing information on the IRA. Both men were charged with various offences under the Act and sentenced to three months imprisonment. Neither man was linked to the bombings, nor to the Littlejohns.Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 14‚Äì15 The Taoiseach at the time, Jack Lynch echoed these suspicions against British Intelligence in a televised interview he gave in 1973: > Well, my suspicions naturally are aroused more ‚Äì we have no, as I said, > indication who was responsible; and as it is now well known, a lot of people > in Ireland believe that many of these unexplained activities and actions > could well be related to British Intelligence or other activities of that > nature.Second Barron Report 2004, p. 79 These allegations of British Intelligence involvement have continued to persist even to the present day, despite the lack of evidence against British Army Intelligence or the security forces in Northern Ireland. Jim Hanna Journalist Joe Tiernan published allegations that the UVF's Belfast Brigade had carried out 1 December 1972 and 20 January 1973 bombings and that the bombing unit was led by Jim Hanna, Billy Mitchell and Ken Gibson. These men were all high-ranking UVF members, and Hanna, who had a seat on the Brigade Staff (UVF leadership) was described by Martin Dillon in his book, The Dirty War as the senior UVF commander in 1973.Dillon, Martin (1991). The Dirty War. London: Arrow Books. p. 277 Tiernan also suggested that the bombing unit was controlled and directed by officers from the British Army Intelligence community operating from Army Headquarters in Lisburn. Tiernan was told by Billy Mitchell in interviews conducted in the 1990s that Hanna was \\"run as an agent\\" by four officers from Army Intelligence based at Lisburn, naming them as two captains, one lieutenant, and an SAS officer.\\"The Dublin and Monaghan bombings: Cover-up and incompetence\\". Politico. Joe Tiernan. 3 May 2007. p. 1 Tiernan's allegations regarding Jim Hanna were published in 2004 in the Barron Report, which consisted of the findings of an official inquiry into the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 commissioned by Irish Supreme Court Justice Henry Barron. Cathal Goulding, former Chief of Staff of the Official IRA told Tiernan in an interview that Hanna had personally admitted to him his leading role in the bombings. Tiernan published the following allegations regarding Hanna in a book he wrote about the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings: > Throughout 1972/73 he [Goulding] and a number of his Official IRA colleagues > held a series of meetings with UVF men, both in Belfast and Dublin, to > discuss mutual working-class issues such as poverty, unemployment and bad > housing in August 1973 a meeting to discuss such issues was held in the > \\"West County Hotel\\" outside Dublin, attended by high-powered delegations > from both organisations ... Towards the end of the evening, according to > Goulding, Jim Hanna pulled him to one side and told him he wished to speak > to him in confidence. \\"He asked me if we, the Official IRA, would be willing > to carry out bank robberies here in the South, and they, the UVF, would > claim them. Then, if we wished, they would carry out similar robberies in > the North and we could claim them. He said Army Intelligence officers he was > in contact with in the North had asked him to put the proposition to us as > they were anxious to bring about a situation in the South where the Dublin > government would be forced to introduce internment. When I refused to accept > his proposition, as we were already on ceasefire, he put his hand on my > shoulder and said, 'Look there's no problem. You see the car bombs in Dublin > over the last year, well we planted those bombs and the Army provided us > with the cars. There's no problem'. When I asked him how the bombings were > carried out, he said the 1972 bombs were placed in false petrol tanks in > both cars. He said they travelled down the main road from Belfast to Dublin > and were stopped at a Garda checkpoint at Swords [North County Dublin] but > because the cars were not reported stolen and the Garda√≠ found nothing > suspicious in them they were allowed to proceed.\\"Second Barron Report 2004, > pp.100‚Äì102 There was no mention in the Garda files of the cars used in the 1 December bombings as having been stopped at a Garda checkpoint in Swords or anywhere in the Republic of Ireland either that day or the previous day. Physically, Hanna was tall with red hair. He was about 25 years old at the time of the bombings. None of the eyewitness accounts mention a red-haired man in his mid-twenties as either a driver or passenger of the bomb cars seen in Dublin before the explosions. Journalist Kevin Myers, who knew Hanna quite well, confirmed that Hanna was the senior military commander in the UVF during this time period with links to British Army Intelligence. However, while he acknowledged the possibility that Hanna had carried out the Dublin bombings, he suggested that he was a \\"fantasist\\" who often \\"embellished or made up stories to make himself seem more impressive\\".Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 83‚Äì84 Tiernan also alleged that Billy Mitchell was involved in the 1974 Dublin bombings, in which 26 people died.Tiernan, Joe (2010). The Dublin and Monaghan Bombings. Eaton Publications. p. 95 Jim Hanna was shot dead in April 1974 by UVF associates in an internal dispute. Mitchell, Ken Gibson and Cathal Goulding are also deceased.

Hutchinson. p. 177 Albert Baker's claims Albert Baker, known by the nickname of \\"Ginger\\", was a former British Army soldier who deserted his regiment in July 1972 to join the legal UDA. He was the ringleader of an East Belfast UDA unit known as the \\"Romper Room\\" gang which carried out a series of brutal \\"romperings\\". These were beatings and torture sessions followed by killings in UDA punishment centres called \\"Romper Rooms\\" after the children's television programme of the same name. He was convicted in 1973 of four sectarian murders and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment which he served in England rather than Northern Ireland. In 1974, at the murder trial of James McCartan (one of his victims), he testified against his former UDA colleagues, however the evidence he produced was dismissed as \\"unreliable\\" by the trial judge and the case subsequently dismissed. Whilst in prison he made a number of allegations against RUC collusion in loyalist paramilitary attacks. He also claimed that the UDA had perpetrated the 1972 and 1973 Dublin bombings, adding that one of the bombers was a member of the UDA's Inner Council, two others have since been imprisoned for other offences, and another has been shot dead.Second Barron Report 2004, pp. 79‚Äì82 Baker's brother told journalist Frank Doherty of the Sunday World, that Albert claimed he had delivered explosions for the bombings from the UDA Londonderry Brigade and drove them from Eglington, County Londonderry down to the bombing team in Belfast. This unit then drove the carbombs to Dublin. According to information given to Frank Doherty by members of Baker's family, 1 December bombings were planned by the UDA in the \\"Rangers Club\\", Chadolly Street in east Belfast's Newtownards Road area. One of the cars which had detonated in Dublin had been hired from a Belfast car firm by a \\"well-dressed Englishman\\" using a stolen driver's licence in the name of Joseph Fleming. Doherty claimed the \\"well- dressed Englishman\\" was a senior UDA member who was originally from England but was living in east Belfast in 1972. He had connections with Albert Baker. The UDA leadership had publicly threatened to launch attacks in the Republic of Ireland with the aim of forcing the Irish Government into taking a more \\"hardline stance towards the IRA\\".The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 94 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings The four bombings in Dublin were not the last. On 17 May 1974 during the evening rush hour, two units from the UVF's Belfast and Mid-Ulster Brigades exploded three no-warning carbombs in central Dublin, killing 26 civilians and injuring close to 300.Taylor, p. 125 Ninety minutes later, a fourth car bomb went off in Monaghan, killing another seven people. The Dublin bombs detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street ‚Äì all located in the city centre. The bomb in Monaghan exploded in North Street. According to Joe Tiernan, RUC Special Patrol Group officer John Weir, and British Army psychological warfare operative, Colin Wallace, the bombings were organised by the Mid-Ulster UVF brigadier, Billy Hanna, who personally led the Dublin bombing teams. Hanna (no relation to Jim), a former sergeant in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) who had won the Military Medal for gallantry in the Korean War, had founded the brigade in his hometown of Lurgan in 1972.Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report 2003), December 2003. p. 174\\"Dublin and Monaghan Bombings: Cover-up and incompetence\\".

The Inquiry concluded that it \\"seemed more likely than not\\" that the bombing of the Film Centre Cinema on 26 November 1972 was \\"carried out by Republican subversives as a response to a Government 'crackdown' on the IRA and their associates\\" and to influence the outcome of the voting in the D√°il regarding the passage of the controversial amendment to the Offences Against the State Acts.The Second Barron Report 2004, p. 87 Regarding 1 December 1972 and 20 January 1973 carbombings, the Inquiry concluded that confidential information obtained by the Garda√≠ indicated the three attacks were perpetrated by the UVF, \\"but no evidence was ever found to confirm this.

He was a favourite of both King John and his son, Henry III, and one of the most powerful royal allies in the Welsh Marches. Life He was born in Monmouth, the son of Gilbert fitzBaderon, and the great-grandson of William fitzBaderon who had been lord of Monmouth at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. John's father died in about 1189, and, being under age, he was made the ward of his uncle, William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, Sheriff of Herefordshire and a court favourite. He was still a ward of de Braose at the time of King John's accession to the throne of England in 1199, but, by 1201, he had married Cecilia de Waleran and paid the king 120 marks and two Norway hawks for his share of her father's property. Like William de Braose, he had a close relationship with the king, who visited Monmouth in 1213 on a hunting expedition. When the king died in 1216, John of Monmouth was present at his bedside, and was one of the executors of his will. He was also involved in the coronation of John's son and successor, Henry III. He was appointed as Constable of St Briavels, and as a Justice in Eyre with responsibility for the law in royal forests. He became one of the most powerful figures in the southern Marches, serving as an advisor to the king on Anglo-Welsh affairs.Monastic Wales: John of Monmouth. Accessed 19 January 2012 In 1226, he established the Abbey of Grace Dieu, a few miles outside Monmouth, but the abbey faced constant attacks from the Welsh who claimed that John had seized Welsh land unlawfully; it was forced to relocate several times. John was also one of King Henry's allies in fighting the rebellions by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ab Iorwerth and Richard Marshal, Earl of Pembroke. However, he reportedly fled the Battle of Monmouth in 1233, when Richard Marshal's forces defeated the defenders of the town led by Baldwin III, Count of Gu√Ænes, and thereafter devastated the surrounding countryside.Edward Foss, The judges of England: with sketches of their lives..., Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1848, p.411 John returned to Monmouth afterwards, and over the next few years increased the extent of his control. He was made chief bailiff of South Wales in 1242, and at one point had control of Chepstow, Usk, Caerleon, Carmarthen, Builth and Cardigan as well as Monmouth. Marriages and issue John's first marriage, in 1201, was to Cecily, the daughter of Walter de Waleran (c. 1143-1200), of Shaftesbury, Dorset. They had three daughters and a son, William. Cecily died in 1222.Thomas Wakeman, On the Priory of Monmouth, in Collectanea arch√¶ologica, British Archaeological Association, 1862, pp.285-292 His second marriage, in about 1223/24, was to Agnes, the daughter of Walter de Muscegros. They had three sons: John, who became lord of Monmouth upon his father's death, Walter and Richard. Death and aftermath He died in 1247 or 1248, and was buried at Monmouth. His tomb was destroyed in the rebuilding of the Priory Church of St Mary in 1737. His son John, who had been born in about 1225, fell heavily into debt and surrendered his estates, including the lordship of Monmouth, to the crown in 1256.

Neurath aimed his criticism at a Cartesian belief that all actions can be subject to rational analysis, saying that Neurath considered that \\"pseudo-rationalists\\", be they philosophers or scientists, made the mistake of assuming that a complete rational system could be devised for the laws of nature. He argued rather that no system could be complete, being based upon a picture of reality that could only ever be incomplete and imperfect. Pseudo-rationalism, in Neurath's view, was a refusal or simple inability to face up to the limits of rationality and reason. \\"Rationalism\\", he wrote , \\"sees its chief triumph in the clear recognition of the limits of actual insight.\\". Whereas a pseudorationalist acknowledges no such limits, but rather contents that all decisions can be subject to the rules of insight. Scientific method is, according to Neurath, pseudorationalist where it contends that the rules for the scientific method will always lead ever closer to the truth. Neurath further challenged Cartesian \\"pseudorationalism\\" by asserting that operating upon incomplete data was in fact the norm, where Cartesian thinking would have it be the rare exception. Rather than there being one, final, rational answer to any given problem, Neurath asserted that scientific endeavour required a continuing and never-ending series of choices, made so in part because of the ambiguity of language.

The peace process has been moderated by the Arab League, the UN Special Envoy on Syria, Russia and Western powers. The negotiating parties to end the conflict are typically representatives of the Syrian Ba'athist government and Syrian opposition, while the Western-backed Kurdish forces have stayed out of the negotiations framework. Radical Salafist forces and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have not engaged in any contacts on peaceful resolution to the conflict. The attempts to find a solution to the Syrian conflict and bring stability to the Middle East began in late 2011, when the Arab League launched two initiatives, but without much success. Russia in January 2012 and in November 2013 suggested talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and opposition. In March‚ÄìMay 2012, hopes were on a United Nations/Arab League plan coordinated by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In January and February 2014, the Geneva II Conference on Syria took place, organised by then-UN envoy to Syria Lakhdar Brahimi. On 30 October 2015, further talks started in Vienna involving officials from the U.S., the EU, Russia, China and various regional actors such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and, for the first time, Iran. Peace talks with rebel leadership continued in Astana, Kazakhstan in 2017. The Kazakh officials are offering Astana as a neutral venue and \\"a natural home\\" for peace negotiations on Syria. The latest major effort to bring about an end to the war started in October 2019 in Geneva with the convening of the Syrian Constitutional Committee to draft a new constitution for Syria under the auspices of the United Nations. Timeline  Arab League peace plans 2011‚Äì2012  Muslims and Christians at a meeting with Arab League monitors in Damascus on 17 January 2012 In November 2011‚ÄìJanuary 2012, the Arab League (AL) twice tried to accomplish an end to Syrian government (and opposition) violence and convince both parties to start talks instead of fighting. After agreement of the Syrian government to the AL plan of 19 December the AL sent a monitoring mission to Syria. Violence continued and Saudi Arabia on 22 January withdrew its monitors from the mission, and called on Russia, China and all other states to pressure Syria strongly to adhere to the AL peace plan. The Arab League on 28 January 2012 ended its monitoring mission.  Russian peace initiatives for Syria   2012 'informal talks' proposal  On January 30, 2012, the Russian foreign ministry suggested \\"informal\\" talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and opposition, and said the Syrian authorities had already agreed to the Russian offer. Abdel Baset Seda, a member of the Syrian National Council's executive committee, told Reuters that the SNC had not received any formal invitation for such talks, but would decline if one arrived: \\"Our position has not changed and it is that there is no dialogue with (President Bashar al-Assad)\\".  February 2012: offering the fall of Assad In February 2012 Martti Ahtisaari held talks with envoys of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. During those discussions the Russian ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, proposed a three-point plan, which would bring the Syrian government and opposition to the negotiation table and result in Assad stepping down as president. But, according to Ahtisaari, US, Britain and France rejected that proposal, being convinced that fall of Assad's government was inevitable. \\"It was an opportunity lost in 2012,\\" he said in an interview in September 2015. Other Western diplomats refute Ahtisaari's claims, with one stating, \\"I very much doubt the P3 [the US, UK and France] refused or dismissed any such strategy offer at the time. The questions were more to do with sequencing‚Äîthe beginning or end of process‚Äîand with Russia's ability to deliver‚Äîto get Assad to step down.\\"  Brokerage Proposal, 2013  On 7 November 2013, Russia again announced it was trying to broker talks in Moscow between the Syrian government and opposition, seeing that the U.S. and Russian negotiators failed to agree on whether or not Assad should be forced out of office.Canceled Syria talks may get new start in Moscow , USA Today, 7 November 2013. Retrieved 25 November 2013. Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Bogdanov said, the Moscow talks could focus on humanitarian problems as well on some political issues. Friends of Syria Group, February 2012 In February 2012, the then French President Sarkozy initiated an international \\"contact group\\" to find a solution for the Syrian conflict, after Russia and China had vetoed a 4 February 2012 UN Security Council resolution. The group held four meetings, all in the year 2012.  Kofi Annan Peace Plan, March 2012  The Kofi Annan peace plan (Joint Special Envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League), launched in March 2012, intended to commit both the Syrian government and opposition to a cease fire and commit the Syrian government to initiate deliberations with the opposition on their aspirations and concerns. After Annan on 12 April had assumed that both parties had agreed to a cease fire, the UN already on 1 May had to admit that both parties were violating it. Geneva I, June 2012 An \\"action group\\" conference (now referred to as Geneva I Conference on Syria) was held on Saturday 30 June 2012, in Geneva, initiated by the then UN peace envoy to Syria Kofi Annan, and attended by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, a representative of China, British Foreign Secretary Hague, and Kofi Annan. Mr Annan, issuing a communiqu√©, said that the conference agreed on the need for a \\"transitional government body with full executive powers\\" which could include members of the present Syrian government and of the opposition. William Hague said that all five permanent members of the UN Security Council‚Äîthe US, Russia, China, France and the UK‚Äîsupported Mr Annan's efforts. Clinton however suggested that Syrian dictator Assad could, in such transitional government, not remain in power, which immediately was contradicted by Lavrov. The Geneva talks were condemned by Ahrar al-Sham leader Hassan Abboud. 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement During the 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement held from 26 to 31 August 2012 in Tehran, Iran and attended by leaders of 120 countries, Iran intended to draw up a new peace resolution aiming to resolve the Syrian civil war. but a consensus was not reached between the leaders.  Eid al-Adha cease fire attempt, September 2012  Lakhdar Brahimi, an Algerian diplomat, appointed on September 1, 2012, as the new UN‚ÄìArab League special representative for Syria, appealed on both the Syrian government and the armed opposition to stop the killing during the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, which fell that year probably on 26 October 2012, and 3 or 4 days after it. Government and most of the opposition groups said 'yes' to his appeal. Yet, the lull in the fighting lasted very short, according to Brahimi, after which both parties accused the other of not having stopped its violence.  Geneva II, 2014  The Geneva II Middle East peace conference was a United Nations-backed international (peace) conference, aimed at bringing Syrian government and opposition together to discuss a transitional government. Lakhdar Brahimi, UN special envoy to Syria, tried to pursue the conference in close cooperation with the U.S. and Russia. It started on 22 January 2014 and ended on 31 January; no agreement was reached.  Astana Opposition conference (2015)  In early April, Randa Kassis asked the Kazakh President to host talks in Astana. The President Nursultan Nazarbayev accepted the proposal. This initiative has been criticized by some of Syrian Opposition members.

The second round of the Vienna talks held in mid-November produced an agreement on the need to convene Syrian government and opposition representatives in formal negotiations under UN auspices with a target date of 1 January 2016. A day after a meeting of anti-government factions, including Ahrar ash-Sham, held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on 10 December produced a statement of principles to guide peace talks with the Syrian government, Syrian president Bashar Assad said he would not negotiate with \\"foreign terrorists.\\" Russia also rejected the outcome of the meeting in Riyadh, which it said was unrepresentative and included terrorist groups.

On 18 December 2015, the UN Security Council, having overcome the gridlock on Syria that had persisted since October 2011,Russia and China veto draft Security Council resolution on Syria UN website, 4 October 2011. unanimously passed Resolution 2254 (2015), endorsing the ISSG's transitional plan that set out a timetable for formal talks and a unity government within six months; the resolution put UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura in charge of organising Syria talks. However, the major powers remained divided on who should represent the Syrian opposition; no mention was made of the future role of Syrian President Bashar Assad.  December 2015 Riyadh conference of Syrian opposition groups  On 10 December 2015, a two-day meeting started in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, aiming at unifying Syria's opposition groups and forming an opposition delegation for the planned negotiations with the Syrian government (see Syria peace talks in Vienna#14 November 2015 meeting).

The WAB, however, is politically unaffiliated; the board does not participate directly in the negotiations but does advise the UN mediator on all proceedings. The WAB has been criticized for the lack of transparency in member selection, with allegations that it is unrepresentative. The Syrian Women's Network went as far as to withdraw from the WAB based on these critiques.  Cessation of Hostilities, February 2016  On 12 February 2016, the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) established an ISSG ceasefire task force, under the auspices of the UN, co-chaired by Russia and the United States, and issued a joint communique saying inter alia: \\"An ISSG task force will within one week elaborate modalities for a nationwide cessation of hostilities.\\" On 22 February 2016, in Munich, foreign ministers of Russia and the U.S., as co- chairs of the ISSG, announced that they had concluded a deal to seek a nationwide cessation of hostilities in Syria to begin a week later. The deal set out the Terms for a Cessation of Hostilities in Syria. Russia and the U.S. proposed that the cessation of hostilities commence at 00:00 (Damascus time) on February 27, 2016.

On 20 December 2016, the foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, and Russia agreed, pursuant to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (Dec. 2015), to hold Syria peace talks in Astana, Kazakhstan. On 28 December 2016, Turkey and Russia agreed on a nationwide ceasefire plan for Syria to go into effect at 00:00 on 30 December 2016. The Syrian Democratic Council‚Äîrepresenting the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish, Arab and Syriac militias mostly led by YPG‚Äîwas not invited to the talks. ISIL, the al-Nusra Front, and the YPG were excluded from the ceasefire, and the following rebel groups signed up for the truce: *Sham Legion *Ahrar al-Sham *Jaysh al-Islam *Free Idlib Army *Levant Front *Jabhat Ahl al-Sham However, the Ahrar al-Sham spokesman denied having signed the deal. The political efforts by Russia and Turkey were endorsed by the UN Resolution 2336 adopted 31 December 2016. First round of Astana talks (January 2017) Russia's special envoy on Syria and lead negotiator to the Astana talks, Alexander Lavrentyev, 23 January 2017 The International Meeting on Syrian Settlement in Astana, 25 January 2017 On 23 December 2016, a Syrian opposition delegation that included twelve rebel factions, and Syria's government delegation headed by Bashar Jaafari convened in Astana for indirect talks titled the International Meeting on Syrian Settlement, sponsored by Russia, Turkey and Iran. Astana was agreed on as the venue, since it was viewed as neutral by all the parties involved. The opposition side included Mohammed Alloush, the political leader of Jaysh al-Islam,Syria conflict: War of words as peace talks open in Astana BBC, 24 January 2017. which Russia had proposed designating as a terrorist organisation. The start of talks in Astana was described as the \\"Astana-isation\\" of the Geneva talks, implying a shift towards the Syrian opposition conducting military operations and away from Syrians with only political influence. The talks are taking place on 23 and 24 January; the first day ended without the sides reaching an agreement. The \\"Astana Process\\" talks aimed to support the framework in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254, and ended on the 24th with an agreement between Iran, Russia, and Turkey to form a joint monitoring body to work to enforce the Resolution 2254 ceasefire. After the talks in January 2017, Russia offered a draft for a future constitution of Syria, which would inter alia turn the \\"Syrian Arab Republic\\" into the \\"Republic of Syria\\", introduce decentralized authorities as well as elements of federalism like \\"association areas\\", strengthen the parliament at the cost of the presidency, and realize secularism by abolishing Islamic jurisprudence as a source of legislation. Geneva IV, February‚ÄìMarch 2017 The Geneva IV peace talks on Syria were talks between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition under the auspices of the United Nations. The opposition was represented by the High Negotiations Committee, while the government delegation was led by Syria's UN ambassador, Bashar Jaafari. The talks began on 23 February 2017 and concluded on 3 March. The government delegation sought to focus on counter-terrorism while the opposition sought to focus on political transition. February 2017 Astana talks Two days of talks on strengthening the ceasefire regime (see above, Dec. 2016) in the nearly six-year-old Syrian conflict ended Feb. 16 in Astana with the adoption of a document to formalise monitoring of the December 29, 2016, ceasefire agreement (see above). The document will guide the activities of a joint operational group to be formed by Russia, Turkey and Iran that was agreed to be set up during the earlier meeting in January in Astana. The document is also meant to guide confidence-building measures among the opposing sides. March 2017 and May 2017 Astana talks: De-escalation zones The third round of meetings in Astana held between 14 and 15 March yielded further agreement by all parties to the existing ceasefire agreement. As a result of these talks, Iran joined Turkey and Russia as a guarantor state. On 4 May 2017, at the fourth round of the Astana talks, representatives of Russia, Iran, and Turkey signed a memorandum to establish four \\"de- escalation zones\\" in Syria. The largest one of those included the Idlib Governorate and adjoining districts of Hama, Aleppo and Latakia Governorates; the other three zones were set up in the northern rebel-controlled parts of the Homs Governorate, the rebel-controlled eastern Ghouta, and along the Jordan‚ÄìSyria border. In those areas, combat operations would be halted as of 6 May 2017; it also envisaged suspension of flights of military aircraft in those areas, as well as the creation of conditions for humanitarian access, medical assistance, the return of displaced civilians to their homes and the restoration of damaged infrastructure. The memorandum was concluded for six months and could be extended automatically.–†–§, –¢—É—Ä—Ü–∏—è –∏ –ò—Ä–∞–Ω –ø–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∏ –º–µ–º–æ—Ä–∞–Ω–¥—É–º –æ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –≤ –°–∏—Ä–∏–∏ –∑–æ–Ω –¥–µ—ç—Å–∫–∞–ª–∞—Ü–∏–∏ Interfax, 4 May 2017. The deal was not signed by Syrian government or rebel groups; rebel representatives rejected it because it left too many loopholes for the Syrian government to continue bombing civilian areas. The Democratic Union Party stated that the ceasefire zones were \\"dividing Syria up on a sectarian basis\\". Astana talks, July 2017 The fifth round of peace talks initially planned for 5‚Äì7 July 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan were moved to 12‚Äì15 July 2017. The Astana Process has the support of the UN's Staffan de Mistura who said the Astana talks are making \\"clear progress\\" to reducing violence in Syria. The Southern Front boycotted these talks. As a precursor to these peace talks, on 9 July 2017 at 0900 GMT, an American-Russian-Jordanian brokered ceasefire commenced, though on July 14, opposition groups participating in the Quneitra offensive rejected the ceasefire, with clashes resuming across Southern Syria. Besides minor violations from all sides involved, as of 15 July, the ceasefire has held. Astana talks, September 2017 On 14 September 2017, representatives of Iran, Russia and Turkey in Astana agreed on the implementation of a fourth \\"de-escalation zone\\", in the northern governorate of Idlib.Syria war: Turkey, Russia, Iran agree Idlib 'ceasefire' zone BBC, 15 September 2017. Kazakh Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov affirmed Kazakhstan's commitment to serving as a neutral venue for continued peace talks. Astana talks, October 2017 The seventh round of the Astana Process on Syrian peace started in Astana with support of both Russia and Iran. The talks maintained previous Astana Process agreements, addressed exchange of detainees, POWs and missing persons. The guarantor states‚ÄîRussia, Turkey, and Iran‚Äîaffirmed consensus that a political solution under UN Security Council resolution 2254 should be found. Astana talks, December 2017 The eighth round of the Astana Process on Syrian peace started in Astana. The talks aimed at ending the nearly seven-year-long conflict in the country, with the humanitarian crisis in the besieged Eastern Ghouta suburb of Damascus at the table. The head of the Syrian Arab Republic delegation called for the \\"immediate and unconditional withdrawal of foreign forces from Syrian territory\\" including Turkish and US forces. Sochi talks, January 2018 In January 2018 Russia convened the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi, in which 1,500 delegates participated. Astana talks, March 2018 The ninth round of the Astana Process on Syrian peace took place on 16 March 2018. The trilateral ministerial meeting on Syria was to include Iran, Russia and Turkey.  Idlib memorandum, September 2018  On 17 September 2018 the Russian president Vladimir Putin and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan reached an agreement to create a buffer zone in Idlib.  Northern Syria Buffer Zone agreement, August 2019  On 7 August 2019, the United States and Turkey reached a deal, which would set up a new demilitarized buffer zone in northern Syria to preempt a potential Turkish invasion of SDF-held Northern Syria. Syrian Constitutional Committee in Geneva, October 2019 In September 2019, Geir Otto Pedersen, United Nations Special Envoy for Syria since 31 October 2018, called for prisoner exchanges as a confidence-building measure between Syrian authorities, opposition groups and civil society groups to take place prior to a planned October 2019 constitution-drafting committee meeting in Geneva. The committee is planned to include 50 people each from government, opposition and civil society, with 15 from each group to work specifically on drafting proposals for a constitution. The Syrian Constitutional Committee officially convened for the first time on 30 October 2019 at the United Nations Office at Geneva. Nur-Sultan meeting, December 2019 The delegations of Turkey, Iran, and Russia arrived in Kazakhstan's capital, Nur-Sultan (renamed from Astana in March 2019), on 10 December 2019 for two days of trilateral talks known as the Astana process. The talks ended without any definitive ceasefire agreement, reportedly due to the anti‚Äìgovernment side's refusal to accept new Russian terms regarding control of the Idlib province.

Another use of the term is to \\"cause an enormous fight or flap, usually by revealing a controversial fact or secret\\", or in other words: to do something suddenly or unexpectedly which leaves the people worried or angry. History and usage The phrase originally referred to the disturbance likely to be created by putting a cat inside a dovecote (or dove house). This disturbance is caused by the cat's tendency to hunt and kill the birds, only made easier by their close proximity. Similarity in other languages and cultures In Dutch, the same meaning is expressed in the proverb \\"De knuppel in het hoenderhok gooien.\\", literally translated to \\"Throwing the bat into the chicken shed\\". Whilst being similar to other idioms such as the German-language phrase das f√ºnfte Rad am Wagen (the fifth wheel on the car), in this case there is an element of aggression, and a power differential becomes the key element in the undesirability. The Spanish-language version of the phrase is alborotar a todo el palomar. In Russian, there is a proverb similar in meaning \\"–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å –∫–æ–∑–ª–∞ –≤ –æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥\\" (let a goat into the garden). In colonial India, a popular pastime was to put a wild cat in a pen with pigeons. Bets would be made on how many birds the cat would bring down with one paw-swipe. The period of the British colonisation of India may have introduced this concept, and hence the phrase to the English language. In French-language, similar meaning is expressed as \\"Jeter un pav√© dans la mare\\" or \\"Lancer un pav√© dans la mare\\", (\\"Throwing a cobblestone in the pond\\"). It illustrates a provocation disrupting a situation that is commonly considered as calm and established (pond represents calm water) while seeking for a reaction of those considering so (who are splashed by the pond content).https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/lancer_un_pav%C3%A9_dans_la_mare In popular culture Cat Among the Pigeons (1959) is the title of a detective- fiction novel by English writer Agatha Christie.

Their music combines elements from many different corners of rock music, including hardcore, post-rock, progressive and math rock and the band strongly aspire to the DIY ethic. Caretaker are well known for their influence and longevity in the UK underground music scene, and their infrequent and informal approach towards releasing records and touring. The band have stuck to the DIY ethic despite airplay from BBC Radio 1 and Xfm, and critical acclaim from NME,Jim Alexander, NME, 18 August 2001 Kerrang!,Ben Myers, Kerrang!, 20 May 2000 Rock SoundVictoria Durham, feature \\"Music with Attitude\\" from Rock Sound, January 2001 and Terroriser.AP, Terroriser, September 2005 During their career, the band have played with well-known acts such as Biffy Clyro, Reuben, Death Cab for Cutie, Oceansize, Les Savy Fav and Hell is for Heroes, as well as having played a headlining show at the Camden Palace (now known as Koko). History Early years Formed at Alton College in 1998, Caretaker quickly became a regular fixture in the Hampshire/Surrey music scene and by the end of 1999 had recording their first EP, (Pause), named after the stage direction so frequently found in the Harold Pinter play The Caretaker, from which the band had taken their name. The EP was released on Badmusic, a label that had been set up for this specific purpose by two friends of the band. Much to the band's surprise, tracks from (Pause) received several plays on BBC Radio 1 by Mary Anne Hobbs, Steve Lamacq and John Peel despite having been recorded in guitarist Harry Goodchild's living room on a budget of ¬£80. In 2000, Caretaker recorded a follow up EP, Routine, which was also released by Badmusic. Also in 2000, Caretaker were approached by well-known London independent record label, Fierce Panda to record a track for a compilation entitled Cutting Hedge. Despite being poorly received by NME,Stevie Chick, NME, 22 April 2000 Caretaker's contribution to the compilation was subject to a positive review in Kerrang! which led to Fierce Panda asking the band to record a mini-album. The self-titled mini- album Caretaker was recorded in 2001 at Southern Studios and received positive reviews from NME, Kerrang!James Sherry, Kerrang!, 28 July 2001 and Rock Sound,Iain Moffat, Rock Sound No.28, September 2001 and led to the band performing a live set on XFM's Xposure Live show with John Kennedy. The Sign of Four and line-up changes In 2003, Caretaker recorded an EP called The Sign of Four, which showed a more aggressive sound than on previous recordings. Shortly afterward, drummer Chris Grigg left the band to pursue further education, leaving Caretaker on hiatus and the EP unreleased. After several months of uncertainty, Reuben front-man Jamie Lenman volunteered to drum for the band and The Sign of Four finally saw release through Function Records in 2005. Also during this time, the band were featured on the soundtrack to the Xbox game Project Gotham Racing 2. Having toured the UK with Reuben, Caretaker began writing their first full length album. Due to Lenman's commitments to Reuben, and Caretaker's increasingly complicated song structures, song writing was a slow process for the band, who continued to gig sporadically throughout the UK. In 2008 Lenman announced that he would leave the band (which coincided with his decision to put Reuben on hiatus) and shortly after, John Hibbird also decided that he would leave the band to travel the world. Three piece After a six month hiatus, remaining members of the band Harry Goodchild and Seb Carey started looking for a new drummer. They quickly settled on Sam Mitchell (Carey‚Äôs cousin), and by September 2008 had started playing gigs again as a three piece. In July 2009 the band recorded the single \\"Rook/Impasse\\" as a taster for the coming album. The songs were recorded by Wayne Pennell, who the band had worked with previously on Sign of Four and was released by the band with no record label involvement. The release was given single of the month in October‚Äôs edition of Rock Sound magazine. Providence In 2010 the band took to the studio again to record their second album, entitled Providence, but due to the band's desire to make the album to the high standard they wanted, and various personal commitments (including Goodchild's and Carey's respective weddings) production on the album was not finished until the latter months of 2011. In the meantime, the band recorded two tracks for a split EP with Oxford Sludgecore band Undersmile, which was released through Blindsight Records in September. Providence was made available to fans for a limited time through the band's website throughout December 2011, and was released on 12 March 2012 through We Be Records. The promotional track \\"Hellion\\" taken from the album was played by Daniel P. Carter on the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show on 16 January 2012.

It was designed by Marinus Jensen and Frank James. The Danish Renaissance elements in the building's design was important to the Danish immigrants to the United States who founded the college. Its features are identical to those found at the Belmont Seminary in Bedford, Virginia. They are reminiscent of the architectural style that was popular during the reign of King Christian IV (1596-1648). The building contained the residence for the college's president and his family as well as all its students, the cook, and other personnel. The library, classrooms, chapel, bookstore and other facilities were also housed there. In 1997 the building was renovated and it was renamed the Humphrey Center at that time.

The history of lobbying in the United States is a chronicle of the rise of paid advocacy generally by special interests seeking favor in lawmaking bodies such as the United States Congress. While lobbying has usually been understood as activity by paid professionals to try to influence key legislators and executives, it has been around since the early days of the Republic, and affects every level of government from local municipal authorities to the federal government in Washington. In the nineteenth century, lobbying was mostly conducted at the state level, but in the twentieth century, there has been a marked rise in activity, particularly at the federal level in the past thirty years. While lobbying has generally been marked by controversy, there have been numerous court rulings protecting lobbying as free speech. Beginnings When the Constitution was crafted by Framers such as James Madison, their intent was to design a governmental system in which powerful interest groups would be rendered incapable of subduing the general will. According to Madison, a faction was \\"a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\\" Madison considered factions as dangerous, since they threatened to bring about tyranny if their control became too great. Madison, writing in the Federalist Papers, suggested that factions could be thwarted by requiring them to compete with other factions, and therefore the powerful force of one faction could be counteracted by another faction or factions. Today, the term \\"special interest\\" has often been equated with Madison's sense of \\"faction\\". In addition, the Constitution sought to protect other freedoms, such as free speech. Accordingly, the ability of individuals, groups, and corporations to lobby the government is protected by the right to petition in the First Amendment. It is protected by the Constitution as free speech; one accounting was that there were three Constitutional provisions which protect the freedom of interest groups to \\"present their causes to government\\", and various decisions by the Supreme Court have upheld these freedoms over the course of two centuries. Even corporations have been considered in some court decisions to have many of the same rights as citizens, including their right to lobby officials for what they want. As a result, the legality of lobbying took \\"strong and early root\\" in the new republic. During the nineteenth century, generally, most lobbying happened within state legislatures, since the federal government, while having larger jurisdiction, did not handle many matters pertaining to the economy, and it did not do as much legislating as the state governments. When lobbying did happen in those days, it was often \\"practiced discreetly\\" with little or no public disclosure. By one account, more intense lobbying in the federal government happened from 1869 and 1877 during the administration of President GrantMargaret S. Thompson, The \\"Spider Web\\": Congress and Lobbying in the Age of Grant (1985) near the start of the so-called Gilded Age. The most influential lobbies wanted railroad subsidies and a tariff on wool. At the same time in the Reconstruction South, lobbying was intense near the state legislatures, especially regarding railroad subsidies, but it also happened in areas as diverse as gambling. For example, Charles T. Howard of the Louisiana State Lottery Company actively lobbied state legislators and the governor of Louisiana for the purpose of getting a license to sell lottery tickets.New York Times - May 27, 1895 Louisiana State Lottery Drawing 1887 Children.jpg|The Louisiana State Lottery Company lobbied the Louisiana state legislature and governor extensively to win permission to run a lottery business in New Orleans from 1866 onwards The Wasp 1891-03-14 cover.jpg|1891 cartoon about lobbying an American assemblyman Twentieth century In the Progressive Era from the 1880s to the 1920s, reformers frequently blamed lobbyists as corrupting politics.Elisabeth S. Clemens, The People's Lobby: Organizational Innovation and the Rise of Interest-Group Politics in the United States, 1890‚Äì1925 (1997) Already the idea that lobbying should become more exposed was beginning to take hold. In 1928, there was criticism of the American Tariff League's payments, in concert with the Republican National Committee, to help elect Herbert Hoover; the League was criticized for failing to report its expenditures and how it had hired two \\"Washington correspondents\\", that is, two lobbyists. During this time, Col. John Thomas Taylor was described by reporter Clarence Woodbury of The American Magazine, as \\"the most successful lobbyist in the history of the world.\\" Thomas was the chief lobbyist for the American Legion. Between 1919 and 1941, he had been able to have 630 different veterans' bills passed through Congress that benefited ex-servicemen by more than 13 billion dollars. In 1932, when President Herbert Hoover described \\"a locust swarm of lobbyists\\" that haunted the halls of Congress, Time magazine named Taylor as one of the agents who was paid $10,000 per year for their actions. When Taylor returned to the U.S. after World War II, he was not satisfied with the original version of the G.I. Bill of Rights and was able to have it amended in ten different places. In 1953, after a lawsuit involving a congressional resolution authorizing a committee to investigate \\"all lobbying activities intended to influence, encourage, promote, or retard legislation,\\" the Supreme Court narrowly construed \\"lobbying activities\\" to mean only \\"direct\\" lobbying--which the Court described as \\"representations made directly to the Congress, its members, or its committees\\". It contrasted it with indirect lobbying: efforts to influence Congress indirectly by trying to change public opinion. The Court rejected a broader interpretation of \\"lobbying\\" out of First Amendment concerns,United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41 (1953) and thereby affirmed the earlier decision of the appeals court. The Supreme Court ruling was: Several political trends emerged from an interplay of factors in the second half of the twentieth century: Creative drawing of electoral districts, called gerrymandering, can make it easier for one party's candidates to win. The electoral maps are drawn such that voters from one party are bunched together in one district -- making that district an easy win for a candidate from that party -- while the remaining districts have slight majorities for the competing party. For example, in the middle drawing, the \\"red\\" party will win three seats while the \\"blue\\" party will win only one seat. The net effect is to give the party with slight majorities in many districts more seats in Congress. * Congresspersons seeking reelection were able to win easily in most cases since rules regarding gerrymandering and franking privileges usually favored incumbents rather than challengers; several studies found that the probability of congresspersons winning reelection was consistently over 90%. Congress made the rules, including ones about free mailings. Congresspersons could give themselves generous pensions and benefits packages, and could determine the salaries of members; in 2006, salaries were $165,200.Salaries of Members of Congress (PDF). Congressional Research Service. Retrieved on August 12, 2007. * Expensive campaigns. But winning reelection meant spending huge sums on expensive media, particularly television advertising, and congresspersons seeking reelection found themselves having to spend much of their time raising money instead of governing. In 1976, the average cost of running for a House seat was $86,000; by 2006, it was $1.3 million. Running for Senate was even pricier, with an average cost in 2006 of $8.8 million. * Lobbyists, who used to focus on persuading lawmakers after election, began to assist congresspersons with reelection fundraising, often via political action committees or PACs. A lobbyist for a cooperative of many businesses could form these relatively new types of organizations to supervise the distribution of monies to the campaigns of \\"favored members of Congress\\". Corporate PACs became prominent quickly until today when they could be described as ubiquitous. There have been reports that the influence of money, in general, has \\"transformed American politics\\". * Partisanship became more prevalent, becoming particularly uncompromising and dogmatic, beginning during the 1980s. A report in The Guardian suggested that widespread gerrymandering led to the creation of many hard-to-challenge or \\"safe seats\\", so that when real contests come along, \\"party activists duke it out among hardcore supporters in primaries\\", and that this exacerbates sometimes bitter partisanship. * Complexity. This was partly a result of a continuing shift of legislative authority from state governments to Washington, and partly as a result of new technologies and systems. It became difficult for voters or watchdog groups to monitor this activity since it became harder to follow or even comprehend. Complexity encouraged more specialized lobbying, often with more than one agency affected by any one piece of legislation, and encouraging lobbyists to become familiar with the often-intricate details and history of many issues. Executive branch agencies added a new layer of rule-making to congressional legislation. The economy expanded. * Earmarks. Special provisions called earmarks could be tacked onto a law, often at the last minute and usually without much oversight, which allowed congresspersons to direct specific funding to a particular cause, often benefiting a project in their home district. Such practices increased Washington's habit of pork barrel politics. Lobbyists such as Gerald Cassidy helped congresspersons understand how to use earmarks to channel money to specific causes or interests, initially towards Cassidy's university clients. Cassidy found earmarks to be a particularly effective way to channel grant money to universities. According to one report in the Washington Post by journalist Robert G. Kaiser, Cassidy invented the idea of \\"lobbying for earmarked appropriations\\" which \\"fed a system of interdependence between lobbyists and Congress\\". * Staffers. The growth in lobbying meant that congressional aides, who normally lasted in their positions for many years or sometimes decades, now had an incentive to \\"go downtown\\", meaning become a lobbyist, and accordingly the average time spent working for a congressperson shortened considerably to perhaps a few years at most. As a result of a new political climate, lobbying activity exploded during the last few decades. Money spent on lobbying increased from \\"tens of millions to billions a year,\\" by one estimate. In 1975, total revenue of Washington lobbyists was less than $100 million; by 2006, it exceeded $2.5 billion. Lobbyists such as Cassidy became millionaires while issues multiplied, and other practitioners became similarly wealthy. One estimate was that Cassidy's net worth in 2007 exceeded $125 million. Another trend emerged: the revolving door. Before the mid 1970s, it was rare that a congressperson upon retirement would work for a lobbying firm and when it did occasionally happen, it \\"made eyebrows rise\\". Prior to the 1980s lawmakers rarely became lobbyists as the profession was generally considered 'tainted' and 'unworthy' for once-elected officials such as themselves; in addition lobbying firms and trade groups were leery of hiring former members of Congress because they were reputed to be 'lazy as lobbyists and unwilling to ask former colleagues for favors'. By 2007, there were 200 former members of the House and Senate were registered lobbyists. New higher salaries for lobbyists, increasing demand and a greater turnover in Congress and a 1994 change in the control of the House contributed to a change in attitude about the appropriateness of former elected officials becoming lobbyists. The revolving door became an established arrangement. In the new world of Washington politics, the activities of public relations and advertising mixed with lobbying and lawmaking.

The church was built in 1869 on a plot of land measuring 5.37 acres at Bejai, which was obtained from the British government on 21 November 1869. The original structure was a chapel from which Sunday masses were offered. History The area of Bejai was covered by the Cathedral parish for around two centuries. The construction of the chapel in Bejai was organised to reduce the inconvenience to Mangalorean Catholic residents of that area, who otherwise would have to travel a large distance to attend Mass. Sunday masses were offered by priests from the cathedral. On 22 March 1912, the chapel was provided with a resident chaplain, Fr. Sebastian Noronha, by Bishop Paul Perini S. J. Fr. Sebastian undertook the effort to establish a primary school for Mangalorean Catholic youth, namely the St. Francis Xavier School for Boys and Lourdes Girls School, in the year 1915. He was succeeded by Fr. Joseph Peter Fernandes, who built a portion of the presbytery in 1920. The present church was built by Fr. A. E. C. Colaco in 1928. He also completed the presbytery, constructed the school building and planned the belfry, which was completed by Fr. Leo Saldana in 1937. In 1963, a girls high school was opened by the Ursuline Franciscan sisters with the assistance of the very Rev. Mgr. F. J. M. Pinto, which provided education up to the 10th Standard. After 1963, there was a relative lack of development. 1995‚Äì2003 The church decorated for a festival Fr. Bernard L. D'Souza came to Bejai church as a parish priest in 1995, and soon commenced developmental activities. The extreme western portion of the cemetery was levelled, permanent graves were shifted to a higher area, the ground was levelled and a community hall in an area of 35 cents was raised with 52 cents parking place. The hall was built within a period of one year and was inaugurated in December 1997. Bejai Church Hall currently has a capacity of 1000 seats, a stage, a gallery of 100 seats, a veranda and in the basement a mini hall with a sound system and seating capacity of 200 seats behind the stage. The total cost of construction was 7.5 million rupees. 2003 onwards The next major development conducted by Fr. Bernard was the Bejai Church Commercial Complex in 1998, which has become a hub of economic activity in the area. In May 2003, Fr. Joseph Peter Tauro was appointed parish priest of Bejai and manager of Lourdes Central School. Shortly afterwards the school was approved for affiliation with the CBSE in New Delhi. The Bejai Church parish celebrated its centenary year in 2011. It currently serves 1,250 families, and a total of around 6000 Catholics in Bejai.

Life He was born at Twickenham; his father, Stirling Gilchrist, lieutenant and surgeon in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, had retired there. Octavius was one of a family of sixteen. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, but left the university early without a degree, in order to assist a relative, Alderman Joseph Robinson, grocer, in business at Stamford, Lincolnshire. In 1803 he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London; and in the following year he married Elizabeth, daughter of James Nowlan, a merchant, of the Hermitage, Wapping. On 30 June 1823 Gilchrist died at his house in the High Street, Stamford; he had long been tubercular. His library, which contained Elizabethan and early printed books, was sold by auction 5‚Äì11 January 1824. Works He printed in 1805, for private circulation, a short volume of Rhymes; and in 1807 he published an edition of the Poems of Richard Corbet. To his friend William Gifford he addressed in 1808 An Examination of the Charges maintained by Messrs. Malone, Chalmers, and others of Ben Jonson's enmity towards Shakespeare; and in 1811 A Letter on the late edition of Ford's Plays directed at Henry William Weber. Early in 1814 Gilchrist printed, but never circulated, proposals for publishing a large play collection; the scheme was abandoned after the appearance of Charles Wentworth Dilke's Old English Plays. Notes of Gilchrist are incorporated in the third edition, by John Payne Collier) of Robert Dodsley's Old Plays, 1825‚Äì7. Gifford, in his editions of Ben Jonson and John Ford, acknowledged the help that he received from Gilchrist's investigations. Gilchrist also probably supplied much of the material for John Drakard's History of Stamford (1822). Controversy The Quarterly Review for June 1812 contains a severe article by Gilchrist on Stephen Jones's edition of David Erskine Baker's Biographia Dramatica. Jones published a reply entitled Hypercriticism Exposed, 1812. The Quarterly Review for October 1820 had some uncomplimentary remarks on William Lisle Bowles, in a review of Spence's Anecdotes. Bowles replied in The Pamphleteer, vol. xvii., ascribing the Quarterly article to Gilchrist, who (while disclaiming the authorship) published a Letter to the Rev. William Lisle Bowles, Stamford, 1820. An acrimonious controversy ensued.

It has 111 local congregations and is represented in twelve states. The highest authority is the Church Council, which meets once a year and consists of representatives from all congregations. The Church Council elects the Executive Committee. The Church Headquarters is in Pune. Ministers are educated at Union Biblical Seminary (UBS) in Pune, which educates ministers to a number of denominations. History At the World Mission Conference in Tambaram, India, in December 1938, the Mission Covenant Church of Sweden President Axel Andersson and the missionary Gustaf Ahlbert examined the possibilities to start mission work in India. Already in 1939 the MCCS decided to start mission work among Turkish peoples and Muslims in India and the following year the first missionaries arrived in Mumbai. The mission work was registered under the name of the Swedish Hindustani Mission. Later on work was also taken up in Pune and Sholapur. The first person baptised was a refugee from Xinjiang, Noor Muhammed, a physician who was given the name Luke. He helped with the translation of the Old Testament into Uighur. On October 19, 1963, 22 delegates from the three congregations in Pune, Mumbai and Sholapur, among them 6 missionaries, assembled and founded the Hindustani Covenant Church (HCC). Rev. B. Thoma became its first moderator and remained at this post up to his retirement in 1986 when he was succeeded by the present moderator, Rev Steven David. Social work HCC has a quite large social work. This is coordinated by a body called Covenant Social Service (CSS). Social work has comprised humanitarian aid in case of catastrophic events like floodings and earth quakes, community development, health care and education. In 1981, HCC founded St. Luke's Medical Society (SLMS), in order to provide health care. SLMS has two hospitals, a smaller one in Nannaj near Sholapur and another one in Aurad, near Gulbarga in Karnataka. HCC also works with education. The Church runs three High schools, in Gulbarga, Nannaj and Sholapur and one Junior College of Science in Solapur. There are also a number of informal education projects for the poorest children. Besides, CSS offers courses leading to certain professions in order to help people to find a sustainable livelihood. See also Christianity in India References * F√§lt, H.

The film traces the lost traditions and the culture of tawaifs (courtesans of North India), particularly, through a song by Rasoolan Bai, Lagat karejwa ma chot, phool gendwa na maar and its lesser known, earlier version Lagat jobanwa ma chot, phool gendwa na maar recorded in 1935 Gramophone recording.Film screening The Hindu, 28 August 2009. The making Saba Dewan spent eight years, researching and gathering information from personal and institutional archives for making The Other Song. The movie went on to become a pioneer in a space where little or no research has been done. The film has a distinctive narrative style and captures rather poetically the story of a tradition and a community lost in history, through interviews with patrons, collectors, musicians and the last of the tawaifs themselves, interspersed with, kothis and musical instruments, galis and temples, that dot the landscape. Synopsis The film spans between personal stories as it interacts with historical events, ultimately, leading to the decline of a great art form. Weaving the past with the present, the film shows the downfall of art from and the community during the Indian Independence, as the identity of the country was being shaped more and more by the upper-caste, Hindu ideas about chastity, mother-figure, the Goddess or Bharat Mata. This new identity celebrated by the Indian bourgeois, stigmatized and punished the tawaifs and their art form for being a symbol and an expression of sexuality and eroticism. The narrative balances music and silence through Hindustani or classical Indian music, such, as thumri, dadra and folk songs, the domain of the tawaifs expertise and traces its slow suppression and disappearance by contrasting it with the silence. The silence is abruptly broken in a particular scene where a group of boys celebrating with loud Hindi-film music during an immersion procession, symbolizes the growing masochistic and chauvinistic sense of society and nation that led to the demise of the tawaif tradition as it was a digression from that identity.

The depot is situated south of Slade Green railway station. History Development The late-Victorian era hamlet of Slade Green consisted of two small farming communities until the South Eastern Railway's (SER) development of the North Kent Line from Strood and Dartford to London Bridge. After considering enlarging the existing depot at Bricklayers Arms, it was concluded that the growth in freight traffic necessitated a new depot. Land was purchased on Crayford marshes, with plans for a brick-built 10-road shed of in length, with two of these feeding a repair shed located in the north eastern corner. With a budget of ¬£55,000, construction started in April 1898, with an allowance for building 145 railway workers houses. On 1 May 1895 a triangular junction was opened with the Bexleyheath line. The shed, initially called Whitehall, Erith was completed on 27 October 1899, under the South Eastern & Chatham Railway (SE&CR;). Better equipped than major depots at Stewarts Lane or Ashford, the main building was fed by two turntables, with a water tank feeding out via a dedicated water softener. The repair shed was equipped with two 5-tonne travelling cranes, allowing full reconstruction of all allocated engines. By the time the first locomotives arrived in November 1899, an external contractor had constructed the 158 houses of the new railway village. The total cost of the project was ¬£74,500, and in scale it was only second to Stewarts Lane, able to service 100 steam locomotives. But its opening allowed closure of the smaller sheds at Woolwich Arsenal and Deptford. Slades Green railway station was opened to serve the depot and adjoining community on 1 July 1900, and by 1910 the full \\"railway village\\" of houses and ancillary community buildings had been completed. Southern Railway After grouping in 1923, the Southern Railway (SR) began the electrification of the former SE&CR; suburban lines, but using the London and South Western Railway 660 V third-rail system. It was planned that the line to Dartford would be an early conversion, so the new trains required servicing. In 1924 the SR proposed reconstruction of Slade Green into a dedicated electric maintenance and repair unit. A budget of ¬£30,000 was allocated to convert the existing shed, added to by an adjoining heavy maintenance shed facing Dartford, capable of all repairs and maintenance. Work started immediately, including conversion of the roof to a flat form, and were completed by the end of 1925, with electric services to Dartford commencing on 6 June 1926. In 1935, along with Orpington, the site became home to the first mechanical carriage washer in the UK. British Rail Southern Region With the introduction in 1952 of the BR Class 415 4EPB units, under the Southern Region of British Railways, in June 1954 the shed was extended by at its London end to fully accommodate a complete 10-carriage unit. The bricks purposefully replicated the original 1899 building, while the new roof had a hump to allow for better rain water removal. On completion, on 1 August 1953, the depot and adjacent railway station officially became Slade Green. 1990/1: Networker depot rebuild With the introduction of the Class 465 Networker and Class 466 Networker fleet, it was proposed in 1990 by British Railways to demolish the 1925 shed and build a brand new eight road structure. Allocated a budget of ¬£20million, the new maintenance depot was officially opened on 8 April 1991, with original BR green 4EPB No. 5001 and a cab mock-up of No. 465001. The new building still had the facilities to carry out heavy repairs on the 1952 slam-door 4EPB stock, a function it fulfilled until the final 4EPB withdrawals in March 1995. Present View from Slade Green railway station looking east towards Dartford from the footbridge, with Slade Green Depot visible ahead Today the site is owned by Network Rail and operated by Southeastern Trains, providing berthing for a range of different EMUs. It consists of the Networker shed to the northside, and on the other side of the Main line associated sidings to the south, which are linked by a pedestrian overbridge. EMU types that are stabled there include Class 465 Networker, Class 466 Networker, Class 375 Express Electrostar, Class 375 Outer Suburban Electrostar and Class 376 Suburban Electrostar EMUs.

Ranma ¬Ω is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. Published by Shogakukan, it was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday magazine from August 1987 to March 1996. The story revolves around a teenage boy named Ranma Saotome who has trained in martial arts since early childhood. As a result of an accident during a training journey, he is cursed to become a girl when splashed with cold water, while hot water changes him back into a boy. Throughout the series Ranma seeks out a way to rid himself of his curse, while his friends, enemies and many fianc√©es constantly hinder and interfere. Shortly after serialization began, Shogakukan began collecting the chapters into tank≈çbon format. 38 volumes were released between April 1988 and June 1996, just three months after the final chapter was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday. Between April 2002 and October 2003, Shogakukan re-released Ranma ¬Ω in a 38 volume shins≈çban edition, with new cover art. A B6-sized edition of the series was published in 20 volumes between July 2016 and January 2018. In the early 1990s, Viz Media licensed Ranma ¬Ω for English release in North America. They published the manga in a monthly comic book format that contained two chapters each issue from June 1992 to 2003; the last being Part 12, Issue 1. Their English release \\"flipped\\" the images to read left-to-right, causing the art to be mirrored. Viz also periodically published the chapters into a graphic novel format, similar to the Japanese tank≈çbon, with 21 volumes released between May 1993 and January 2003. Having earlier ceased publication of all manga in the comic book format, Viz posted a press release on March 18, 2004 announcing that they were changing their graphic novel format and would reprint all earlier volumes to match. However, the reprints of Ranma ¬Ω actually began in 2003. Starting with volume 22, the content of this \\"second edition\\" remained the same, with mirrored art, but moved to a smaller format with different covers and a price drop. The 36th and final volume was released on November 14, 2006. In 2013, Viz Media announced that they would be re-releasing Ranma ¬Ω in a \\"2-in-1 edition\\" that combines two individual volumes into a single large one. For the first time in English, this edition restores the original art and right-to-left reading order. 19 volumes were released between March 11, 2014 and March 14, 2017.

It is consistent under the assumptions of the fixed effects model. In certain situations it can be more efficient than the standard fixed effects (or \\"within\\") estimator. The estimator requires data on a dependent variable, y_{it}, and independent variables, x_{it}, for a set of individual units i = 1, \\\\dots, N and time periods t = 1, \\\\dots, T The estimator is obtained by running a pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation for a regression of \\\\Delta y_{it} on \\\\Delta x_{it}.  Derivation  The FD estimator avoids bias due to some omitted, time-invariant variable c_{i} using the repeated observations over time: :y_{it}=x_{it}\\\\beta + c_{i}+ u_{it}, t=1,...T , :y_{it-1}=x_{it-1}\\\\beta + c_{i}+u_{it-1}, t=2,...T . Differencing both equations, gives: :\\\\Delta y_{it}=y_{it}-y_{it-1}=\\\\Delta x_{it}\\\\beta + \\\\Delta u_{it}, t=2,...T , which removes the unobserved c_{i}. The FD estimator \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{FD} is then simply obtained by regressing changes on changes using OLS: :\\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{FD} = (\\\\Delta X'\\\\Delta X)^{-1}\\\\Delta X' \\\\Delta y Note that the rank condition must be met for \\\\Delta X'\\\\Delta X to be invertible (rank[\\\\Delta X'\\\\Delta X]=k). Similarly, :\\\\widehat{Avar}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{FD})=\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^{2}_{u}(\\\\Delta X'\\\\Delta X)^{-1} , where \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^{2}_{u} is given by :\\\\hat{\\\\sigma}^{2}_{u} = [n(T-1)-K]^{-1}\\\\hat{u}'\\\\hat{u} .  Properties  Under the assumption of E[u_{it}-u_{it-1}|x_{it}-x_{it-1}]=0, the FD estimator is unbiased and consistent. Note that this assumption is less restrictive than the assumption of strict exogeneity required for unbiasedness using the fixed effects (FE) estimator. If the disturbance term u_{it} follows a random walk, the usual OLS standard errors are asymptotically valid.  Relation to fixed effects estimator  For T=2, the FD and fixed effects estimators are numerically equivalent. Under the assumption of homoscedasticity and no serial correlation in u_{it}, the FE estimator is more efficient than the FD estimator. If u_{it} follows a random walk, however, the FD estimator is more efficient as \\\\Delta u_{it} are serially uncorrelated.

Monuments inside the church include one to George Milborne, who died in 1637. The entire building was heavily restored in the 1860s, and the tower is dated 1865. Further restoration was undertaken in the 1880s, through gifts by Sir John and Lady Adela Searle after they came to live at nearby Wonastow Court. They also provided a new porch in 1909, and a rood screen and reredos in 1913, as well as stained glass windows and a new altar.

It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris History Nicolas Poussin painted this work for his longtime friend and patron, Jean Pointel, who was a rich banker in Paris. Pointel also was a member of the libertines, a circle which Poussin himself frequented. It was in Pointel's collection, which had many works by Poussin, but was stored away after the political climate in Paris changed. In its place Poussin\`s landscape with snake and dying man, was hung in Pointel\`s private collection. Poussin places the story of Orpheus in the Campagna Romana (Roman countryside): the Castel Sant'Angelo and the Torre delle Milizie (\\"Tower of the Militia\\") figure in this painting, borrowed from the landscape of the Eternal City. Dense smoke pours from a fire which devastates the Castle, and darkens a sky already overcast with sombre clouds. The fall of the light divides the landscape diagonally into bright and dark areas - a division clearly seen on the Torre delle Milizie.F. Negri Arnoldi, Storia dell'Arte, Fabbri Group (1990), Vol.3, pp.260-262, . See also, Many of Poussin's pictures have darkened, mainly as a result of a red underpainting which has begun to show through the colours.

He graduated from a German secondary school (Realschule) in 1869 and continued his studies at the German Technical University in Prague, where he played an active part in the Association for Free Lectures on Mathematics - a student association and the predecessor of the Union of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists. From 1872 to 1874, while he was still a student, he acted as an assistant to Karel Koristka. He submitted his habilitation thesis on practical geometry (geodesy) to the Technical University at Prague in 1876 and obtained the right to lecture. From 1875 to 1886 he taught at the Second German Realschule in Prague. He married Johanna Liebleina in 1878 and had a daughter Berta, born in 1879. Czuber was appointed as an ordinary professor (equivalent to today's full professor) at the German Technical University in Brno in 1886. In the academic year 1890-91 he was a Rector of the university. After the end of the academic year 1890-91 he took up an appointment as an ordinary professor at the Technical University in Vienna. The position became vacant when Anton Winckler applied for retirement and, although Czuber was not the first choice to fill the chair, other people who were put forward such as Moriz All√© and then Emil Weyr were not interested in accepting it. Czuber was Rector in the academic year 1894-95 and continued to hold the position of professor at the Technical University of Vienna up to 1921 when he finally retired. Among the topics Czuber studied was probability theory and related areas, contributing in 1900 to the 'Enzyklop√§die der mathematischen Wissenschaften'. In fact, he wrote the first papers with original results on the probability theory in the Czech region. A large part of his studies, however, was devoted to questions concerning actuarial mathematics. He wrote several books (in German) such as Theorie der Beobachtungsfehler (1891), Die Entwicklung der Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und ihre Anwendungen (1898), Die Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und ihre Anwendungen auf Fehlerausgleichung. Statistik und Lebensversicherung (first edition 1903, second edition 1908, reprinted 1968), Die statistischen Forschungsmethoden (1921), Die philosophischen Grundlagen der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung (1923), and Mathematische Bev√∂lkerungstheorie (1923). For several years he was an editor of 'Technische Bl√§tter' (1876 to 1886). He also wrote some textbooks, e.g., 'Lehrbuch √ºber Differential- und Integralrechnung' (1898) and 'Einf√ºhrung in die h√∂here Mathematik' (1909). He translated a textbook 'Calcul des probabilit√©s', which had been written by Franz A Meyer. On the other hand his book Wahrscheinlichkeiten und Mittelwerte (1884) was translated into French, although the translation was not published until 1902. As an author he was active right up to the end of his life. He was honoured many times: at the age of 48 he was a \\"court advisor\\" (a special title typical for Austro- Hungarian Empire). He also received an honorary degree from the Technical University in Munich in 1918. His daughter Bertha (1879-1979) was the morganatic wife of Archduke Ferdinand Karl of Austria, the younger brother of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the heir to the Austrian throne until his death in Sarajevo in 1914.

This species can reach a length of TL. Taxonomy and evolution This fish was first described in 1960 by the Japanese ichthyologist Nobuhiko Mizuno who gave it the name Tukugobius flumineus. It was later transferred to the genus Rhinogobius, becoming Rhinogobius flumineus. The name comes from the Greek, \\"rhinos\\", meaning nose, and the Latin, \\"gobius\\", meaning gudgeon; the specific name comes from the Latin \\"flumen\\" meaning river. This fish is commonly known as the \\"lizard goby\\" or in Japanese as \\"kawa-yoshinobori\\". Rhinogobius flumineus seems to have evolved from Rhinogobius brunneus to which it is morphologically very similar. There is a trend for fish in the genus Rhinogobius to move from marine to freshwater habitats as they evolve, and R. brunneus is amphidromous (migratory) while R. flumineus inhabits land-locked river basins. Distribution and habitat R. flumineus is endemic to Japan where it is found in riffles and swiftly-flowing mountain streams and small rivers. Its range extends from Shizuoka Prefecture and Toyama Prefecture in Honshu to the westward tip of the island, and the islands of Shikoku and Kyushu. It is a benthic species. Where it coexists with the slightly larger Rhinogobius nagoyae, the latter tends to occupy the riffles that are its favoured habitat, and R. flumineus finds alternative locations. Ecology R. flumineus holds itself in a stationary position on a rock in fast-flowing water by means of a \\"sucker\\" formed from its two ventral fins. The mouth is slightly asymmetric; dextral fish tend to curve their bodies to the right as they rest while sinistral fish tend to adopt a left-curving posture. The fish are omnivorous, picking edible items of food off the river bed with the side of the mouth, but dextral and sinistral fish have no preference for which side of the mouth they use for this purpose. The breeding season is from June to August. The eggs are deposited in a nest and guarded by the male, and the newly-hatched juvenile fish live on the riverbed.

Early life Chettiar was born on 21 September 1901 in Avanipatti, a village in Tamil Nadu's Sivaganga district. He was the third of five children to PR Periannan Chettiar and Visalakshi Aachi. His passion was journalism and he was a writer for several newspapers in India. In his early 20s, he decided to leave the Sivaganga district, where his father was a wealthy local businessman, in order to explore new territories. He traveled to British Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka), where he saw the conditions of the Indian labourers for whom he decided to promote justice and equality by establishing a newspaper. Founding Virakesari Chettiar established a newspaper in 1930 and named it Virakesari, meaning \\"victorious lion\\". The first edition was published on 6 August 1930 in Colombo. He acted as the paper's editor-in-chief and guided the publication for over 20 years. After Ceylon obtained its independence from British dominance, the Parliament of Ceylon enacted the Ceylon Citizenship Act. Rather than taking up Ceylonese citizenship in order to continue running the business, Chettiar chose to return to India and sold his interests in Virakesari in 1965. Today, this newspaper is the most widely circulated and read newspaper by the entire Tamil speaking population in Sri Lanka. Business expansion Chettiar purchased assets and established businesses in Malaysia and Singapore in the 1950s. In Singapore, he set up a money lending business under the name of \\"SVSP Money Lending\\", which was a part of the Nattukottai Chettiars business houses. Chettiar invested in real estate in and around Singapore. He purchased estates in Malaysia and established the Veerakesari Rubber Estates in Gelang Patah, Malacca, which was the first asian plantation in Malacca. While a majority of the estates were owned and run by expatriate planters of British origin, Veerakesari Plantations was the first to be run by an Asian. Consolidation After running his overseas businesses for over three decades, Chettiar eventually decided to hive them off and consolidate interests in his native village in India, where he spent the latter part of his life. He planned to bring Virakesari Newspapers to India by setting up an Indian publishing operation to based in Karaikudi in Sivaganga district. However, this plan was shelved in the final stages of execution. Eventually, he established Kesari Brothers & Co, a limited holding company registered at Alagapuri, Sivaganga district, under which a multitude of companies were set up and run with operations across the southern districts. With business interests in multiple countries, Chettiar decided to embark on a six-month world tour in 1955, for business and pleasure. With the aid of a personal assistant who accompanied him, Chettiar visited most of the Asian countries including Japan, China, Hong Kong, Korea, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia and a few other Western nations. Public life and philanthropy Profile picture of PPR Subramaniam Chettiar Chettiar headed several public trusts and initiatives. As a philanthropist, he built temples and water tanks and contributed to various charities and public institutions in the Sivaganga district. His contributions include funding and managing the construction of the Sri Sundara Vinayagar Temple in Avanipatti in 1938, construction of the central water tank on Kuruvikondanpatti's main road, and setting up of the Visalakshi Padasalai School to provide free elementary school education to children. He served as the managing trustee of several temples in the Sivaganga region including the Sri Kailasanathar Nithyakalyani Amman Temple at Ilayathangudi, which is the first of the clan of nine temples of Nagarathars. Subramaniam Chettiar was an influential public figure in the Sivaganga district, hence was often requested to mediate and settle public disputes. He did this on a voluntary basis, often traveling to far-flung places in the region to help resolve familial and civic conflicts in an amicable manner. Thanks to the many neutral and successful outcomes, this service was often sought after and he helped avoid expensive litigations that could have taken years to resolve through the standard legal procedures. Family He was married to Kuppal Aachi with whom he had three children. After Kuppal Aachi's death at an early age, he married Ponnammal Aachi with whom he had eight children. He died on 23 January 1975, at the age of 73.

One copy of the mutation increases the risk of a blood clot from 1 in 1,000 per year to 2.5 in 1,000. Two copies increases the risk to up to 20 in 1,000 per year. Most people never develop a blood clot in their lifetimes. It is due to a specific gene mutation in which a guanine (G) is changed to an adenine (A) at position 20210 of the DNA of the prothrombin gene. Other blood clotting pathway mutations that increase the risk of clots include factor V Leiden. Prothrombin G20210A was identified in the 1990s. About 2% of Caucasians carry the variant, while it is less common in other populations. It is estimated to have originated in Caucasians about 20,000 years ago.Kniffin, Cassandra L. & McKusick, Victor A. (2012-06-20). Coagulation factor II; F2: .0009 thrombosis, susceptibility to OMIM. Accessed January 23, 2012. Signs and symptoms The variant causes elevated plasma prothrombin levels (hyperprothrombinemia), possibly due to increased pre-mRNA stability. Prothrombin is the precursor to thrombin, which plays a key role in causing blood to clot (blood coagulation). G20210A can thus contribute to a state of hypercoagulability, but not particularly with arterial thrombosis. A 2006 meta-analysis showed only a 1.3-fold increased risk for coronary disease.Deficiencies in the anticoagulants Protein C and Protein S further increase the risk five- to tenfold. Behind non-O blood type and factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A is one of the most common genetic risk factors for VTE.Increased production of prothrombin heightens the risk of blood clotting. Moreover, individuals who carry the mutation can pass it on to their offspring. The mutation increases the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can damage veins throughout the body, causing pain and swelling and sometimes leading to disability. Most individuals do not require treatment but do need to be cautious during periods when the possibility of blood clotting are increased; for example, during pregnancy, after surgery, or during long flights. Occasionally, blood-thinning medication may be indicated to reduce the risk of clotting. Heterozygous carriers who take combined birth control pills are at a 15-fold increased risk of VTE, while carriers also heterozygous with factor V Leiden have an approximate 20-fold higher risk. In a recommendation statement on VTE, genetic testing for G20210A in adults that developed unprovoked VTE was disadvised, as was testing in asymptomatic family members related to G20210A carriers who developed VTE. In those who develop VTE, the results of thrombophilia tests (wherein the variant can be detected) rarely play a role in the length of treatment. Cause The classical blood coagulation pathway The polymorphism is located in a noncoding region of the prothrombin gene (3' untranslated region nucleotide 20210), replacing guanine with adenine. The position is at or near where the pre-mRNA will have the poly-A tail attached. Diagnosis Diagnosis of the prothrombin G20210A mutation is straightforward because the mutation involves a single base change (point mutation) that can be detected by genetic testing, which is unaffected by intercurrent illness or anticoagulant use. Measurement of an elevated plasma prothrombin level cannot be used to screen for the prothrombin G20210A mutation, because there is too great of an overlap between the upper limit of normal and levels in affected patients. Treatment Patients with the prothrombin mutation are treated similarly to those with other types of thrombophilia, with anticoagulation for at least three to six months. Continuing anticoagulation beyond three to six months depends on the circumstances surrounding thrombosis, for example, if the patient experiences a thromboembolic event that was unprovoked, continuing anticoagulation would be recommended. The choice of anticoagulant (warfarin versus a direct oral anticoagulant) is based on a number of different factors (the severity of thrombosis, patient preference, adherence to therapy, and potential drug and dietary interactions).Kearon C, Akl EA, Ornelas J, et al. Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease: CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report. Chest 2016; 149:315. Patients with the prothrombin G20210A mutation who have not had a thromboembolic event are generally not treated with routine anticoagulation. However, counseling the patient is recommended in situations with increased thrombotic risk is recommended (pregnancy, surgery, and acute illness). Oral contraceptives should generally be avoided in women with the mutation as they increase the thrombotic risk.Bauer, K.A.(2018). Prothrombin G20210A mutation. In T.W. Post, P. Rutgeerts, & S. Grover (Eds.), UptoDate. Available from https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prothrombin-g20210a-mutation?search=prothrombin%20gene%20mutation&source;=search_result&selectedTitle;=1~103&usage;_type=default&display;_rank=1#H3703116740 Terminology Because prothrombin is also known as factor II, the mutation is also sometimes referred to as the factor II mutation or simply the prothrombin mutation; in either case, the names may appear with or without the accompanying G20210A location specifier (unhelpfully, since prothrombin mutations other than G20210A are known).

This was announced at a press conference on 19 January 2012. The purpose of the coup was to establish Islamic law in Bangladesh. A number of officers including retired ones were arrested. The coup plotters argued that they were nationalists trying to prevent Bangladesh from being turned into a puppet of India. Background In 2009 few months after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina came to power; the BDR Mutiny by border-security soldiers in Pilkhana in Dhaka led to 56 officers being killed. Some 800 Paramilitary personnel were charged for their involvement in the mutiny, and the crisis frayed ties between the civilian administration and elements of the military establishment. In 1975, mutinying soldiers had killed Hasina's father, Bangladesh's first Prime Minister ‚Äî Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The alleged conspiracy against the government comes more than a year after five military officers were sentenced to five years of imprisonment in a court-martial for their \\"involvement\\" in attempted murder of Fazle Noor Taposh, the influential nephew of Sheikh Hasina, following the 2009 mutiny by Bangladesh Rifles. Coup The Bangladesh Army reported a failed coup d'√©tat was supposed to take place on January 2012 by rogue military officers and expatriate but was stopped by the Bangladesh army on December 2011. Brigadier General Muhammad Mashud Razzaq, director of Personnel Services Directorate disclosed the plot at the Army Officers Club in Dhaka Cantonment on 19 January 2012. He also 14-16 mid ranking officers were involved, including Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haque alias Major Zia. Major Zia had called senior to midlevel army officers in different bases in the country to bring out soldiers under their command to establish Sharia law. His post on Facebook was published by the Daily Amar desh which created coup-rumors in the army. Major Zia used a UK based roaming sim to contact fellow army officers. A retired officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ehsan Yusuf was also involved in the plot. Military officials stated that the coup was instigated by hard-line Islamist military officers, while University of Dhaka political scientist Ataur Rahman and other analysts suggested it may have been caused by military unrest over a 2009 crackdown on the military. Intelligence sources quoted by The Christian Science Monitor reported that the coup was an attempt to introduce sharia law by Islamist military officers with ties to Hizbut Tahrir, an Islamist group that is outlawed in Bangladesh. The coup attempt had apparently been planned over several weeks or months with support of religious fanatics outside of Bangladesh. Military sources said that up to 16 hard-line Islamist officers were involved in the coup, with some of them being detained. Lieutenant colonel Ehsan Yusuf was arrested on 15 December 2011 and Major Zakir Hossain 31 December 2011. Brig. Gen. Muhammad Masud Razzaq, Director of the Personnel Services Directorate described the conspiracy involving a dozen active duty and retired officers that he said was intended \\"to spread disaffection in the Bangladeshi Army.\\" The Brigadier said the plot was uncovered in December following the detention of mastermind Ghulam Azam, former Ameer of the Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh. Azam, who opposed the independence of Bangladesh during and after the 1971 war, is alleged to have led the Razakar and Al-Badr formations that resisted the India-trained Mukti Bahini. A slew of arrests had taken place silently in Bangladesh through December, prompting Khaleda Zia the former Prime Minister to allege that army officers were becoming victims of \\"sudden disappearance\\". Aftermath On 28 December, a military court of inquiry was established to investigate the matter and punish those involved. Retired Major General Sayed Mohammad Ibrahim, a defense analyst, said the country and its democratic structures were reasonably immune to interference. \\"Today's news about events in the army is worrying but will not cause any damage to democracy,\\" he said. The military spokesperson also said the initial investigations found non-resident Bangladeshis (NRB) link to the plot while at least one of the officers, the fugitive Major, was linked to banned Islamist group Hizbut Tahrir. He mentioned, \\"Stringent legal measures will be taken against the persons involved in the conspiracy after proper investigation.\\" The army spokesman underlined that banking on the army in the past, \\"different evil forces availed political gains and made abortive attempts to do so but as an institution, military still has to bear the stigma\\". non-resident Bangladeshi, Ishraq Ahmed, who was involved in the coup said the coup goal was topple Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from ‚Äúletting Bangladesh be 'turned into a Bantustan' run by India‚Äù. Major Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haq and Ishraq Ahmed are on the run.

By combining physics of structures with meteorology, properties of the building, weather conditions including outdoor temperature, wind power and direction, as well as solar radiation can be taken into account. In the case of conventional heating control, only current outdoor temperature is considered. The starting point for developing the method of forecasting was the ENLOSS mathematical energy balance model developed by Prof. Roger Taesler Taesler, R.

Forecasting method began to be introduced to use in the late 1980s. Until 2010 inclusive, forecasting method has been introduced in nearly seven million square metres of floorage of residential buildings and commercial premises. Forecasting method is offered and developed by many companies and organizations. Estimated data indicate 10 - 15 kWh/m2 reduction of average annual heat energy consumption. Since forecasting method contains information about future demand and is not in conflict with other methods of increasing energy efficiency, it is always a good foreground solution.Sasic Kaligasidis, A et al. (2006) \\"Upgraded weather forecast control of building heating systems\\". p. 951 ff in Research in Building Physics and Building Engineering Paul Fazio (Editorial Staff), Forecasting in practice As far as practical use of forecasting method is concerned, usually remote control forecasting receivers are used to send and receive data by means of GPRS or GSM network. Then, the forecasting receivers manage the operation of control panels installed in buildings which adjust distribution of heat energy in the heating system of a given property. Recently, special remote control weather loggers have started to be used in combination with forecasting receivers. The weather loggers measure air temperature and humidity with high accuracy and the measurements are sent in real time to forecasting receivers to which they are connected. Such a turning point in technology indicates even higher precision of forecasting method. Notes References *Sasic Kaligasidis, A et al.

His most famous song is \\"Broom Buzzems\\". He became known later as the \\"ancient laureate of the Tyne\\" and was remembered in the songs of Robert Gilchrist (1797‚Äì1844) and Thomas Thompson (1773‚Äì1816).  Early life  William Purvis was the son of John Purvis, a waterman, and Margaret Purvis (who died in All Saints Poorhouse aged over 100). William was born early in the year of 1752 in Newcastle, and baptised at All Saints' Church on 16 February 1752. He was either blind from birth, or very shortly after, although he often made comments from which the onlooker would think he could see. Very rarely did he perform in the street, preferring to perform in ale houses, in which he would depend on the charity of the public, but as he seemed to bring trade and the public appeared to like his ditties this seemed an amicable arrangement. He was apparently hatless in all weathers and to most of the locals and to his clientele he was just \\"Blind Willie\\".  Later life  William Purvis was an inhabitant of the All Saints Poorhouse but wandered around much of the town, distinguishing every street, alley, house, or shop with astonishing exactness. Even when a tenancies changed, he soon discovered the name of the new tenant, and would, call it out the next time he passed. He was a great favourite of the local populace and few would pass him by in the street without recognition and a degree of sympathy. He died on Friday 20 July 1832 at the age of 80.  Works  His favourite appeared to be \\"Buy Broom Buzzems\\" or \\"Broom Besoms\\" which some said he composed although others disputed this fact. However, he made it his own, and added and removed extra simple verses to suit himself (and his audience)  Notes  Much of the information on Blind Willie comes from the book Northumbrian Minstrelsy. This book, edited by J. Collingwood Bruce and John Stokoe, is a collection of ballads, melodies and small-pipe tunes of Northumbria. It was first published by the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1882 and contains notes of the songs and tunes. This book quotes: Other references appear in the Newcastle Monthly Chronicle and an edition of Volume 2 (pages 517 and 518) of 1888 This gives an interesting description of Blind Willie as: There are mentions in two other articles in this same publication on Pages 80 and 517. An article on page 353 and 354 of the Monthly Chronicle of 1889 entitled \\"View near the Close Gate 1826\\" mentioned \\"Blin'd Willie\\".

The first stationary installation of Liquid Sound equipment was then inaugurated on November 9, 1993, in the therapeutic pool of the Bad Sulza Clinical Center and served as the basis for all of the subsequent installations.Website: Liquid Sound The name was not familiarized, however, until after 1993, through intensive advertising and marketing in the three so- called \\"Toscana Hot Springs\\" in Bad Sulza, Bad Schandau, and Bad Orb; there are similar facilities in Bad Nauheim and Berlin. Since then, numerous wellness hotels in Germany, Austria, South Tyrol, and on the Costa del Sol in Spain have been offering Liquid Sound pools with various sizes and forms.Sabine Kartte: \\"Wasser f√ºr die Seele (\\"Water for the Soul\\").

Live concerts are also carried out on certain dates such as nights when the moon is full.Baden wie in Bad Sulza (\\"Bathing as in Bad Sulza\\"). In: Der Tagesspiegel, March 20, 2002 The esoteric concept on which this is based is controversial. In the northern Pacific in 1985, Remann had performed communication experiments with orcas and sought methods of sharing these whale songs with human beings in search of sources of energy underwater. The result was a sophisticated technology with underwater loudspeakers, digital light sets, amplifiers, and mixing consoles in hot springs facilities, the economic success of which is documented by the rising number of visitors to the spas. For Liquid Sound, for instance, a special stereo set is necessary because one hears differently underwater than in the air: it is impossible to hear from where the tones are coming. The reason is that sound waves go through water about five times as fast as through the air. Due to its higher speed, the sound seems to be coming from everywhere.Gabriele Hellwig: \\"Liquid Sound ‚Äì Baden in Licht und Musik (Bathing in Light and Music)\\" In: Sauna & B√§derpraxis 1/2008 \\"Liquid Sound combines the knowledge of modern medicine: relaxation techniques, mind technology, balneotherapy, with art (music and architecture), and bathing pleasure (whirlpools, steambaths, sauna landscapes, inhaling, sun parlors, restaurants, etc.)\\" Marion Schneider: \\"Liquid Sound ‚Äì Eintauchen in eine andere Welt\\" (\\"Diving into a Different World\\").

He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1988 on drugs charges. Martorano was released in October 2015 after serving over 32 years. In 1984, on the advice of his attorney Robert Simone, Martorano pleaded guilty to 19 counts of drug possession and distribution. Martorano was subsequently advised by both the prosecution and the judge, John Berne Hannum, that this plea could result in a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The prosecution, however, had only recommended a sentence of from 40 to 54 months. On September 20, 1984, Martorano was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the longest prison term ever imposed on a first-time non-violent offender in American history.  Controversy  Martorano's father was reputed mobster Raymond \\"Long John\\" Martorano. Louis Pichini, a prosecutor with the U.S. Organized Crime Task Force, pressured George Martorano for information on the Philadelphia mafia. But Martorano has always denied having any detailed knowledge of his father's business dealings. Judge Hannum's excessive sentence was a part of this pressure.

The collaborators included members from Jamaat-e-Islami, Muslim League and Pakistan Democratic Party. The victims of the massacre were all Hindus. It is estimated that more than 3,000 Bengali Hindus were killed in the massacre within a few hours.  Events  On the early morning of 23 April, the Hindus from the twelve villages of Jagannathpur, Chakhaldi, Singia, Chandipur, Alampur, Basudebpur, Gauripur, Milanpur, Khamarbhopla and Sukhanpokhari set out for India. On their way, thousands of them gathered at a place called Jathibhanga for the onward journey. Soon after their arrival, the local collaborator blocked their exit routes out of Jathibhanga and informed the Pakistani Army. The Hindu men were led in a procession towards the Jathibhanga grounds. The Pakistani army who had by then arrived in two military trucks, forced the fleeing Hindus to stand in lines and burst fired them using machine guns. The killing spree started in the morning and went on till afternoon. After the military left, the collaborators moved the corpses to near the Pathraj river and covered them with earth. The estimated casualty varies between 3,000 and 3,500. However, it is generally accepted that more than 3,000 people died in the massacre. An estimated 300 to 500 women were widowed.  Memorial  In 2009, the Bangladesh government constructed a memorial at the site of the mass killing. In 2011, the survivors and the victims of the massacre brought out a mourning rally to commemorate the dead, followed by a condolence meeting.

Description The star pearlfish is a long, slim, silvery fish growing to a maximum length of . It has dark-pigmented spots, known as melanophores, scattered irregularly across its translucent, scaleless body. The dorsal and anal fins run the length of the body, with the dorsal fin rays being shorter than those of the anal fin. No pelvic fins are present. The posterior part of the upper jaw has numerous pointed, cardiform teeth arranged in rows, but no large fangs or gaps occur between groups of teeth. The eyes are well developed, although these fish mainly live in darkness. The swim bladder lies below the 9th and 10th vertebrae and has two chambers. The precaudal vertebrae are 15 to 17 in number.Carapus mourlani (Petit, 1934) FishBase. Retrieved 2012-01-18. Distribution C. mourlani is found on reefs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean down to about . Its range includes the coastlines of South and East Africa, the Seychelles, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Micronesia, northern Australia, and Hawaii. Biology The star pearlfish is a commensal of starfishes such as Culcita novaeguineae and holothurians such as Bohadschia argus and Stichopus spp. It spends most of its time in the coelomic cavity of its host, emerging, usually at night, to feed. Some species of Carapus feed on small crustaceans, other carapid fish, and possibly, polychaete worms. This species is usually found singly in its host, or sometimes as a male and female pair. The fish works its way in through the anus of the sea cucumber. When it is living in a starfish, it enters its host's body cavity through the grooves associated with the tube feet. A pair of fish may release their gametes within the body cavity of the host, and the fertilised eggs may later emerge into the water column.When Fish Live in your Cloaca & How Anal Teeth are Important! The Pearlfish-Sea Cucumber Relationship Echinoblog. Retrieved 2012-01-18. A study designed to discover whether there were genetic differences between the pearlfish living in holothurians and those living in starfish was inconclusive. During the experimental work, a large sea cucumber, Bohadschia argus, was put in a bucket of relatively cold water, which caused 14 pearlfish to emerge, with a further one remaining inside. This is believed to be the record number of carapid fish ever found in a single holothurian.

The company characterizes itself as offering services for \\"advanced compromise protection.\\" Their marketing materials describe their services as being for the detection and prevention of compromised systems on a network, and include their Nemesis Compromise Protection (Nemesis) and Harbinger Compromise Assessment (Harbinger) services. Defence Intelligence was the security company that discovered the Mariposa botnet in 2008, which consisted of 8 to 12 million individual zombie computers at the time of its dismantling in 2009.  History  Defence Intelligence was founded in 2008 by Christopher Davis, a Canadian security consultant who had previously aided in identifying an 18-year-old hacker in 2000 that stole 26,000 credit card numbers from e-commerce sites. Chris Davis collaborated along with Dan Kaminsky to inform key agencies in the Canadian government about the DNS cache poisoning flaw. Prior to founding Defence Intelligence, Davis was the director of threat analysis for the Atlanta-based security company Damballa (company). In 2008, Defence Intelligence discovered the Mariposa botnet, one of the largest known botnets to date. In 2009, the Mariposa Working Group was formed. The MWG, consisting of members from Defence Intelligence, Panda Security, Neustar, Directi, and Georgia Tech Information Security Center, worked with international law enforcement to dismantle the botnet and aid in the arrest of the suspected creator and controllers of the botnet. In 2011 Keith Murphy, founder and president of non-profit One Dollar Nation, became CEO of Defence Intelligence. While no formal press release was made stating this change, numerous news articles began referring to Keith Murphy as CEO. In that same year the company released Nemesis 2.0, the most current version of their main service and launched a new website with updated branding.  Mariposa  Mariposa, meaning \\"butterfly\\" in Spanish, was the name given to the botnet as a whole due to its usage of the malware program \\"Butterfly bot\\". The botnet was composed of millions of infected or zombie computers controlled by the same operators. The number of computers infected by Mariposa was between 8 and 12 million spread over 190 countries. Victims included more than half of the US Fortune 1000 companies as well as numerous governments and financial and educational institutions. Mariposa was used for denial of service attacks, spamming, and personal information theft. It was capable of spreading via MSN, peer to peer networks, and USB keys. The Spanish national police Civil Guard (Spain) arrested three men in February 2010 for suspected involvement with the Mariposa botnet. In July 2010 the suspected creator of the \\"Butterfly bot\\" malware was arrested by Slovenian police.

The school district covers that includes the city of Davenport, where it is based, and the western Scott County communities of Blue Grass, Buffalo and Walcott in addition to a small section of Muscatine County. Founded in 1858 it established one of the first publicly funded high schools in the United States, the third teachers‚Äô training school and hired the first female superintendent in the country. It serves nearly 16,000 students in 32 school buildings. History Phebe Sudlow The first schools in Davenport were subscription schools where students paid a fee to attend. They were held in crude surplus buildings or in private homes. Marianne Hall opened the first school in 1838 followed by the school started by the Rev. Michael Hummer the same year. The following year Moses Parmele opened a school as did the Rev. J.A.M. Pelamourges who opened a school at St. Anthony‚Äôs Church that remained open until 1968. Similar schools opened in the 1840s. As the population increased in the 1850s there was a desire to establish public supported schools. Six schools were built during the decade. Five were built around the town‚Äôs commercial and industrial core and one was built in the Village of East Davenport, which had recently been annexed to Davenport. A school was also founded for African American children at the same time. It lasted for only a short time as there were too few children to justify the expense. Davenport schools were integrated at that time. After a new state constitution and school legislation passed in Iowa the Davenport Independent School District was formed in 1858. City founder Antoine LeClaire loaned the new district $500 to get started. Abraham S. Kissell was named the first superintendent for the district as well as the state of Iowa. He had previously been a teacher in Davenport. He supported graded schools and equal pay for female teachers. The district also educated students 14 to 17 from its very beginning in what was called an ‚Äúintermediate‚Äù school. They decided to not call it a high school because a majority of taxpayers did not support funding a high school, which was seen as a way of subsidizing the education of the children from wealthy families. In 1861 Kissell was elected the president of the Iowa State Teachers Association and in 1864 he became the Iowa State Superintendent of Schools. The district‚Äôs sixth superintendent was Phebe Sudlow who held the position from 1874 to 1878. She had been a teacher and principal in Davenport since 1858. Now she was the country‚Äôs first female superintendent. Sudlow insisted and received the same salary as her predecessor. In 1877 she was elected as the president of the Iowa State Teachers Association. Once again she was the first woman to hold that position as well. She left Davenport to take a teaching position at the State University of Iowa. Other innovations the district initiated in the 19th century included adding drawing, physical education, music and German classes to the curriculum. Most other public schools did not add such courses until the early 20th century. Kindergarten was added to the elementary schools in 1913 and Intermediate schools were added in 1919 when Frank L. Smart was the superintendent. While these had been implemented in larger school districts they were unusual in smaller districts. Lincoln Elementary School The school district operated the Davenport Teacher Training School from 1859 to 1924. At that time teachers were only required to pass an exam to become a certified teacher. Davenport‚Äôs training school provided new teachers with a year of additional classes before they took the exam. The school operated out of various school basements and spare classrooms before it became part of the high school curriculum in 1915. The program ended in 1924 with the advent of state teacher‚Äôs colleges and licensing standards. The Davenport Board of Education evaluated its elementary school facilities in the 1920s and at the same time did a study of the projected growth of the city and where that growth would take place. They projected that the number of elementary-aged students would rise by almost 3,000 students between 1930 and 1950, but they did not prepare a building plan based on these projections. By 1936 the elementary school population had reached the projected number of students. The board decided at that time to close twelve of its old elementary schools and build six new ones. The plan cost the school district $2.5 million with the federal government contributing 45% of the costs that were paid for through the Public Works Administration. The new elementary schools built at that time included Jefferson, Lincoln, Madison, McKinley, Monroe and Washington.

Edwin Drood later visits Cloisterham, initially to see Rosa, before going off to his uncle's house. His arrival at the Nuns' House, the boarding school where Rosa lives, is met with much excitement by the other occupants, while Rosa appears indifferent at best. It is soon apparent that theirs is an odd relationship and Rosa shows little passion for it, something Edwin communicates to his uncle after the visit. In the same scene, the attraction Jasper seems to have for Rosa, as indicated in his earlier hallucination, is buttressed by a drawing of her enjoying pride of place on his wall, which Edwin believes he has kept because he (Edwin) was the artist. A second arrival to Cloisterham follows Edwin's, as Neville Landless and his twin sister Helena arrive from Ceylon, Neville to study with one of the minor canons, Reverend Crisparkle, and Helena will live at the Nuns' House with Rosa. Failing to engage them in conversation, Reverend Crisparkle and his mother invite Edwin and Rosa to meet them. While Jasper plays on the piano and Rosa sings along, his desire for her becomes more obvious, and is immediately noticed by Helena. At the same event, Neville becomes attracted to Rosa and takes an immediate dislike to Edwin, and Helena and Rosa strike up a friendship, after the singing exercise leaves the latter unsettled. Back at the Nuns' House, Helena makes her suspicions known to Rosa, who confides to her that she loathes and fears her music-master, Jasper. Neville and Edwin, meanwhile, have a brief scrap, and Edwin later provokes him into reacting violently, which Jasper reports to others, giving birth to Neville's reputation of having a violent temper. Meanwhile, having an interest in the cathedral crypt, Jasper seeks the company of Durdles, a man who knows more about the crypt than anyone else. Durdles takes Jasper into the cathedral crypt. Jasper provides a bottle of wine to Durdles. The wine is mysteriously potent and Durdles soon loses consciousness. Rosa, convinced she does not love Edwin, visits her guardian, Mr Grewgious. When she asks whether there would be any forfeiture to her inheritance if she does not marry Edwin, he replies that there would be none on either side. Mr Grewgious gives Edwin a ring which Rosa's father had given to her mother, with the proviso that Edwin must either give the ring to Rosa as a sign of his irrevocable commitment to her or return it to him. The next day, Rosa and Edwin amicably agree to end their betrothal. Unfortunately, Jasper, who had been given information by Mr Grewgious to indicate that the betrothal might not go through, sees his delight crushed by a misreading of their conversation, mistaking the amicable parting for a confirmation of shared affection. Reeling from his anger, he arranges a reconciliation dinner between Edwin and Neville, which proves successful. Drood and Neville leave together to go down to the cathedral, where they learn they have more in common than was previously thought. Neville is seen to depart, but the next morning Edwin is missing and Jasper spreads suspicion that Neville has killed him. Neville leaves early in the morning for a hike, but the townspeople overtake him and bring him back to the city. Mr Grewgious keeps Neville out of jail by taking responsibility for him: he will produce him any time his presence is required. Meanwhile, Deputy, Durdles' little helper, finds the ring discarded on the graveyard floor. While defending Neville's innocence against Jasper's accusations, the twins confess that they did not come to Cloisterham to further their education but to find their father, the late Edwin Drood Sr. As Edwin Jr was their brother, they argued, Neville had no cause to murder him. Jasper refutes their claims, but Mr Grewgious begins to look into it, assisted by Neville and Grewgious's clerk, Bazzard. In dream sequences it is shown that Jasper is responsible for killing Edwin, though no one is certain what he has done with the body. He visits Rosa at the Nuns' House and professes his love for her. She rejects him but he persists; he says that he will never give up on her until he is dead. In fear of Jasper, Rosa goes to Mr Grewgious in London. Jasper is informed of Rosa's disappearance and follows her, but Neville and Helena prevent him from taking her with him. As he departs, Mr Grewgious informs him that Edwin and Rosa had ended their betrothal, meaning he has murdered his nephew for no reason. Bazzard, calling himself Dick Datchery, arrives in Cloisterham. His investigations show no evidence of Edwin Drood Sr's death, so he extends his search. He asks directions from Deputy, who will not go near Jasper for fear that he will choke him again, the choirmaster having threatened to kill him earlier. At the same time, Reverend Crisparkle is given a letter which seems to confirm Helena's assertion that Jasper is obsessed with Rosa, and he stumbles upon Bazzard and Deputy, who have broken into Jasper's flat. All three begin to work together to solve the mystery of Drood Jr's disappearance and enlist the help of Durdles to search the tombs for his body. Believing also that Jasper killed Edwin, Rosa promises to leave with him if he will show her where he placed Edwin's body. He takes her to the Cathedral, where they overhear the investigative quartet down below. Rosa escapes from his clutches only to bump into Edwin, who informs her that he simply left for Egypt, where his father had a business, and discarded the ring in anger after she called their betrothal off. At the same time Jasper stumbles upon Reverend Crisparkle, Durdles, Bazzard and Deputy, who have located a recently deceased body in the Drood tomb. Jasper confirms that it is Drood Sr, who he states was his father and not his brother-in-law as previously believed, and confesses to killing him a year earlier when he showed up suddenly to look for Edwin. Edwin himself appears and Jasper, thinking him a ghost, takes his own life. In the aftermath, Edwin accepts the twins as his siblings and Neville's offer to go into business with him. A romance having been budding for the duration of the story, Helena accepts Reverend Crisparkle's unspoken proposal. Differences from Dickens' unfinished novel  In the book, Neville and Helena have arrived from Ceylon but there is no indication that they are natives, as is the case in the film. The novel has no indication that they are Edwin's siblings. In the book, Jasper threatens Deputy because he believes he was spying on him. In the film, he does so because Deputy pelted him with pebbles. Mr Tartar does not appear in the film, and it is Bazzard who pretends to be Dick Datchery. It has an original ending‚Äîthe unfinished novel ends when the opium den proprietor and Datchery turn up in Cloisterham. Filming locations Much of the filming was done in Rochester, Kent. Rochester Cathedral and its grounds feature extensively in the series. In particular, the exterior of Jasper's Gatehouse was filmed at the Cathedral Gate in Minor Cannon Row and Jasper's Gatehouse interior was filmed at Eastgate House in Rochester High Street. The scenes in the marshes were also shot in Kent, at Riverside Country Park in Gillingham.

Corwin (October 10, 1818 ‚Äì August 11, 1863) was a Democratic politician and jurist from Ohio, United States. He was elected to the Ohio Supreme Court and ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives. Biography Corwin was born in Urbana, Champaign County, Ohio on October 26, 1818. His parents were Moses B. and Margaret Corwin. Moses Corwin was the first lawyer in Champaign County and was the cousin of Thomas Corwin, Governor, Senator and Secretary of the Treasury. After he finished school, Corwin ran a newspaper called the Rattler in about 1837 and studied law under his father. He was admitted to the bar at age 21 and established a law practice with his father in Urbana. They had clients throughout central Ohio, and John A. became a highly regarded criminal defense attorney. He started like his famous relatives as a Whig but switched to the Democratic Party in about 1840. Moses Corwin had been in the Ohio House of Representatives and ran for Ohio's 4th congressional district as the Whig nominee in 1848. John A. decided to run as a Democrat against his father, and they had debates before immense crowds throughout the district. Moses won in the solidly Whig district. In 1850, John A. challenged Whig Benjamin Stanton in the same district and again lost convincingly. In 1851, Ohio adopted a new constitution that made seats on the Ohio Supreme Court elective. The first election was in October 1851. Corwin was nominated by the Democrats, and the Democrats won all five seats. The new court was seated February 9, 1852, and the judges drew lots for a length of their first term, so re-elections would be staggered. Corwin drew a four-year term. In 1854, he challenged George E. Pugh for the Democratic nomination for United States Senate but lost. He did not serve his whole term but resigned on October 28, 1854. After he resigned, Corwin returned to Urbana to practice law, spent 1857 in Cincinnati, Ohio, in practice with another former justice, Robert B. Warden, and returned to Urbana in 1858. In 1860, he supported the southern faction of the Democratic Party that nominated John C. Breckinridge but joined the 13th Ohio Infantry for three months service as a Captain on April 20, 1861, resigning before his three months were up. Corwin suffered from tuberculosis for six months before he died at his Urbana home on August 11, 1863. He was buried at the cemetery in Urbana. Corwin married Mary Vance, and they had one son.

History RTM was initially launched as Research Management (RM) in the spring of 1958;WorldCat Online Library Resource: Research Management, accessed Feb. 17, 2012. Its focus was disseminating information on the techniques of organization, administration, and operation of industrial research.Burrill, Charles. Research Management, Interscience Publishers, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1958), p. 3. According to Charles Burrill, the first chairman of the Board of Editors for RM, ‚ÄúWhy another publication? Because there has been no one place to turn for the latest ideas regarding research management discussions from the research administrator‚Äôs point of view.‚ÄùBurrill, Charles. Research Management, Interscience Publishers, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Spring 1958), p. 3. RM was published quarterly, in digest format, averaging 64 pages per issue. In 1962, the quarterly schedule was upgraded to a bimonthly publication schedule. In 1982, IRI began presenting the Maurice Holland Award for the best paper published in RM during the previous year. In 1985, RM began publishing the R&D; Trends Forecast, which summarized the data collected during IRI's annual survey of its member companies‚Äô spending expectations for the coming year. The article continues to be published in the first issue of RTM each year. In 1988, Research Management was renamed Research-Technology Management (RTM). RTM retained RM‚Äôs focus on practitioner-oriented articlesIndustrial Research Institute, Inc., accessed Feb. 17, 2012..

In a career that lasted from April 1834 to April 1835 he ran seven times and won six races. His most important win came in May 1834 when he won The Derby. His only defeat, in the St Leger at Doncaster later that year, was widely believed to be the result of foul play. After three successes as a four-year-old in 1835 he was retired to stud where his record was disappointing. Plenipotentiary was regarded by racing experts as one of the best British racehorses of his era. Background Plenipotentiary was a big, heavily built chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze standing 15.2 hands high. He was described as a horse of \\"extraordinary beauty\\" but also possessing the size and strength to work \\"between the shafts of a cabriolet\\". He was bred by his owner Stanlake Batson of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire. His sire, Emilius, won the Derby in 1823 and went on to become a successful stallion at the Riddlesworth stud which was owned and run by Thomas Thornhill. Apart from Plenipotentiary, Emilius's best winners included Priam (Derby), Riddlesworth (2000 Guineas) and Mango (St Leger) and he was British Champion sire in 1830 and 1831. Plenipotentiary was one of several good winners produced by the mare Harriet. According to one account, however, there was some doubt about Plenipotentiary's paternity: Thomas Thornhill's son-in law claimed that Harriet had actually been covered by a stallion named Merlin. Plenipotentiary's rather unwieldy name was habitually shortened to ‚ÄúPlenipo‚Äù by racing followers and writers. He was trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by George Payne. Racing career 1834: three-year-old season Plenipotentiary was unraced as a two-year-old but was not unknown to the racing world as he appeared in the betting for the 1834 Derby in October 1833 when he was offered by bookmaker at odds of 30/1 and quickly backed down to 15/1. Plenipotentiary made his first racecourse appearance at the Craven Meeting at Newmarket in April 1834. He started the 1/2 favourite and won a ¬£50 Sweepstakes from an unnamed ‚ÄúEmilus colt‚Äù, in exceptionally impressive style. Two days later, he ran against much stronger opposition in a ¬£100 Sweepstakes. His only rival was Lord Jersey's colt Glencoe, who had won the important Riddlesworth Stakes two days earlier and the race between the two impressive colts created intense interest. James ‚ÄúJemmy‚Äù Robinson on Glencoe attempted to expose any weakness in Plenipotentiary's fitness by setting an extremely testing pace. Plenipotentiary, however was able to match the leader's speed before moving easily clear to win by three or four lengths. Robinson commented that he thought that he had the race won before he saw ‚Äúthat great bullock cantering at my side‚Äù. Two weeks later, Glencoe won the 2000 Guineas. At Epsom, on 29 May Plenipotentiary started 9/4 favourite for the Derby in a field of twenty-two runners, with Shilelagh, ridden by Sam Chifney being his main rival in the betting at 3/1. The race was the most anticipated for several years and attracted a crowd which was described as being unusually large and fashionable. After five false starts the race got under way, and although he broke quickly, Plenipotentiary was restrained by Patrick Conolly and settled just behind the leading group. After moving through a gap along the inside rails, Plenipotentiary moved up to challenge Glencoe for the lead early in the straight. The two colts raced side by side until they were inside the final furlong where Conolly made his move, and the favourite quickly went clear to win very easily by two lengths from Shilelagh, with Glencoe third. Plenipotentiary and Glencoe were scheduled to meet again in the St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, but Lord Jersey withdrew his colt and Plenipotentiary was allowed to walk over for the ¬£850 prize money. One report claims that Plenipotentiary looked very unsteady on his feet when cantering over the course, but little attention was paid to this at the time. Plenipotentiary started 10/11 favourite for the St Leger at Doncaster in September against ten opponents. His first appearance in front of the crowds, however, led to alarm, as he seemed barely able to gallop and was described as looking \\"more like a pig than a racehorse\\", causing his supporters to start \\"hedging\\" their bets by wagering on other runners. In the race, Plenipotentiary ran very poorly: he struggled to match the pace of the other runners and despite being ridden hard by Conolly he dropped away to finish tenth behind the 40/1 outsider Touchstone. Various reasons were suggested for Plenipotentiary's dismal performance. Some felt that he had he was lacking fitness and that the colt's naturally bulky physique had been allowed to run to fat. Others noted that the normally lively and energetic Plenipotentiary seemed sluggish and unsteady before the race and suggested that he had been drugged by bookmakers or other \\"scoundrels\\" who stood to lose a great deal of money if the colt won. This explanation was \\"generally believed\\", and it was pointed out that the security at the racecourse stables was unacceptably lax. Conolly said that the colt seemed ‚Äúdead as a stone‚Äù. 1835: four-year-old season In the spring of 1835, Plenipotentiary returned to Newmarket for the Craven meeting at which he ran three times. He first ran against a strong field in the Craven Stakes. The pace was very strong as his opponents attempted to \\"choke off\\" the favourite, but Plenipotentiary won easily, beating Nonsense by a length with Shilelagh among the beaten horses. His next race provoked great interest as he ran over a sprint distance for the first time, being matched against the 2000 Guineas winner Clearwell in a Subscription Plate over five furlongs. He won by three lengths with his jockey declaring that he was \\"never at half his speed\\". His final ‚Äúrace‚Äù was a walkover for the Port Stakes later that afternoon when all four of his opponents were withdrawn. Plans to run Plenipotentiary in the Ascot Gold Cup were abandoned on the day before the race, despite the fact that he had been performing well in exercise. Some reports claim the colt \\"went amiss\\", while others state that Batson was unwilling to risk his horse on the prevailing hard ground. There was some anger about his late withdrawal from the race, and his trainer George Paine, was advised to leave Ascot for his own safety. Plenipotentiary never ran again and was retired to stud. Assessment The village sign at Horseheath In May 1886 the Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts asking them to name the ten best horses of the 19th century. In July of that year the results of the poll were published as a ranking list. Although his racing career had ended more than fifty years earlier, Plenipotentiary was ranked eighteenth, having been placed in the top ten by fifteen of the voters. He was the second highest-placed horse of the 1830s behind Bay Middleton. Sam Chifney was reported to have said that the Derby runner-up Shilelagh was a better horse than his 1830 winner Priam but was a stone (14 pounds) inferior to Plenipotentiary. Baily's Magazine when comparing great horses expressed the view that the field beaten by Plenipotentiary at Epsom was one of the strongest in the history of the race. The author of \\"The Cracks of the Day\\" offered the opinion that Plenipotentiary was, to his \\"humble thinking\\", the best racehorse England ever possessed. The village sign at Horseheath carries a picture of Plenipotentiary. Stud career Plenipotentiary began his career as a stallion with a fee of 25 guineas. He sired two Classic winners in Potentia (1000 Guineas) and Poison (Epsom Oaks), while the best of his colts was probably The Era, who won a Northumberland Plate and defeated Cotherstone in a private trial. Given his prowess as a racehorse however, his record as a sire was a disappointment, with the Sporting Review noting that his achievements read \\"better in the Calendar than the Stud-Book\\". In his later years he was covering half-bred mares for local farmers at a fee of 5 guineas. He died at Denham, near Uxbridge in either December 1853 or January 1854. His gravestone is in the woods at Denham Place. Pedigree *Plenipotentiary was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Sir Peter Teazle, meaning that the 1787 Derby winner appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

The top level of the bridge will carry road traffic, while the bottom will carry rail traffic. Construction is being carried out by the Kyiv City Council. The construction of the bridge has been frozen multiple times due to a lack of funding. In 2017, the bridge was reported to be 65% complete. In 2018, construction accelerated. In early 2019, authorities planned to launch vehicle traffic along the bridge before 2021. Location The bridge is located midway between the existing road Petrovskyi Railroad Bridge and the Parkovyi Pedestrian Bridge. The bridge is located just north of the entrance to Kyiv Harbour. Design The bridge is intended to connect Podil on the right bank with Voskresenka and Raiduzhnyi Masyv on the left bank. Starting in Podil the bridge will cross the Rybalskyi Peninsula, the Dnieper River, Trukhaniv Island, and the Rusanivski Sady dacha community, terminating on the left bank. The bridge is actually a combination of several bridges, ramps, and other types of viaducts with a total length of . It consists of several major components: * three bridges over Kyiv Harbour * a bridge over Dnieper (main part) * a bridge over Chortoryi * a bridge over Raiduzhne Lake * viaducts over Trukhaniv Island and Horbachykha * four multi-level road interchanges The bridge roadway is intended to have three lanes each way with a projected traffic intensity of 59,000 vehicle per day. The bridge will also carry the Podilsko‚ÄìVyhurivska line containing three metro stations on the bridge. Accidents Accident with the crane Zakhariy Construction site as of 2009, pictured from the Rybalskyi Peninsula The bridge in 2015 On November 18, 2011 a crane vessel Zakhariy that was being used in the construction fell into the river and broke apart. The accident destroyed the crane and polluted the Dnieper's waters with crane oil and construction materials. During the accident, two other barges were damaged; the Harbour Bridge was only lightly damaged. In December 2011, legal issues with the private owners of the land were settled, and the construction process was finally expanded to Trukhaniv Island. In popular culture In 2017, French rapper OrelSan produced a video-clip on this bridge for his song \\"Basique\\". Some scenes from the Diesel brand \\"Go with the Flow\\" campaign were filmed on this bridge.

It is a spicy, full-fat, raw milk cheese without holes. The cheese is manufactured exclusively with manual labour, usually on a wood fire. An extra-hard variety of Berner Alpk√§se, known as Berner Hobelk√§se (planing cheese), is aged for at least two years and it is this variety that is most widely available. Both Berner Alpk√§se and Berner Hobelk√§se are AOCs (now AOPs) in Switzerland.Translated from w:de:Berner Hobelk√§se The cheese is made exclusively from recognized Alpine farms during the Alpine season. Only milk from cows fed on pastures which have not been fertilised artificially may be used. The milk is highly flavoured from the Alpine herbs and is much richer in polyunsaturated fatty-acids than milk from the lowland regions.Christa Hauswirth, Martin Scheeder, J√ºrg Behr (2004) \\"High œâ-3 Fatty Acid Content in Alpine Cheese, The Basis for an Alpine Paradox\\", Circulation, Vol. 109 pp. 103-107 The cheese must be made no later than 18 hours after milking. As a rule, the chilled evening milk is partly skimmed to produce a fat content of at least 45% in the final product. This is then mixed with the morning milk. The milk is heated to and cultured bacteria from the region are added along with the rennet. After 30 minutes, the curds are cut with a cheese-harp into pinhead-sized grains. The curds and whey are then heated to which shrinks the curds and kills any unwanted bacteria. The curds are packed into a cheese-mould and pressed for 15 hours, after which time the cheese-loaf is soaked in brine for 24 hours. The cheeses, in rounds of at least , are aged at a humidity of over 85% and the rind is brushed regularly with brine. The initial ripening period occurs on-site and later the cheese is aged in the cellars of cheesemongers and dairies. After a maturation period of 6 to 18 months, the cheese is ready for consumption. The second ripening, of at least one year, occurs at a much lower humidity and the rind is no longer washed. The annual production is about 1000 tonnes of cheese, a third of which is further processed into Hobelk√§se. About 75% of production is marketed directly by the producers, and the remainder in the general trade. Alpk√§se is consumed mainly as sliced cheese. Hobelk√§se is too brittle to be cut with a knife and so it is planed into thin rolls or crumbled into small pieces. Berner Alpk√§se is very similar to Sbrinz but the latter is produced in the lowlands and is much saltier, undergoing a longer brining period of 15 to 20 days.

The Committee oversees working groups which examine current research on a particular topic, to identify best practices for effective management of R&D.; The working groups, under loose supervision by the Committee, meet several times a year, usually at IRI-sponsored events,. Their findings are typically published in IRI‚Äôs bimonthly journal, Research-Technology Management (RTM).\\"A Fresh Look for Research-Technology Management\\", International Association for Management of Technology, Jan. 6, 2012, accessed Feb. 21, 2012. IRI‚Äôs ROR meetings provide a forum for practitioners of R&D; management and technological innovation to share best practices, current undertakings, and planning at their respective organizations in relation to innovation management. History IRI‚Äôs Board of Directors formed an ROR Subcommittee in 1968, following an unsuccessful effort to convince the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish research-on-research centers at U.S. universities. The subcommittee concluded that the field was important enough that the idea should be developed even without NSF support \\"Former IBM exec is new director for Center for Innovation Management Studies\\" , NC State University: Poole College of Management, Sept. 13, 2005, accessed Feb. 21, 2012.). A standing committee was created in 1971 to carry out research about the process of research in industry. The first Committee had six members, plus a representative from the IRI Board of Directors. Its first action was to appoint five project subcommittees to address selected topics identified by a 1969 survey that were considered important to the IRI membership. Jason Salsbury, the first chair of the ROR Committee, explained ‚ÄúMore than any other area, R&D; is managed by policies and practices stemming from folklore rather than facts. Thus, the goal of the ROR Committee is to develop pertinent factual information on a variety of topics about the research process of interest to IRI members, working through its subcommittees.‚ÄùLarson, Charles F. \\"50 Years of Change in Industrial Research and Technology Management,\\" Research-Technology Management, Vol. 50, No. 1 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2007).

Each group brings together industry leaders in research, technology, and innovation to collaborate, share experiences, and research case studies to determine best practices in the group‚Äôs focus area. .\\"Research-On-Research Reports,\\" Research-Technology Management, Vol. 54, No. 6 (November‚ÄìDecember 2011), pp. 49-50. Organization and Purpose of ROR Committee The ROR Committee acts as a steering committee within IRI, providing guidance and oversight to the working groups, though the members are not necessarily a part of the working groups themselves. The Committee is composed of six or seven people from IRI member companies who meet with prospective co-chairs of the various working groups to draw up timelines, methodologies, and deliverables.Alan Fusfeld Bio, accessed Feb. 21, 2012. The leadership also checks to ensure continued progress on research topics. The purpose of the ROR Committee, as outlined by IRI, is to:\\"Managing High Uncertainty Innovation\\" , CSIRO, July 2008, accessed Feb. 21, 2012. * develop and communicate a galvanizing strategic plan for the ROR working groups consistent with the long-range needs of IRI's stakeholders; * create new ROR projects that address major issues of the IRI membership, including emerging IRI constituencies such as the electronics, software, and communications industries; * actively manage the ROR project portfolio to assure that projects are solidly initiated, well directed, and aggressively executed to generate high value for the IRI membership; * maintain active liaison with other IRI committees and networks, and with entities outside IRI that are engaged in key interests of the ROR; and, * utilize the ROR portion of the IRI Website as a strategic marketing tool for delivering products to the IRI membership and generating new member interest. Purpose of ROR Working Groups The ROR working groups are voluntary and temporary, with individuals working on a defined problem for a predetermined time, and then disbandingn. The purpose of the ROR working groups, according to IRI, is to:Research-on- Research Homepage * identify and promote effective techniques for the organization and management of research, development, and engineering in support of technological innovation; * encourage high standards in technological innovation; * develop methods for determining the effectiveness of technological innovation, and promote an understanding of the value of technological innovation to the economy, industry, and society; * strengthen understanding of business issues by technology leaders as well as business leaders‚Äô understanding of the technological innovation process; * foster cooperation on a worldwide basis with academia, government, and other organizations active in technological innovation; and, * provide member- company representatives a forum for building a network of contacts among their peers.

The preprocessor interprets a subset of the full PL/I language to perform source file inclusion, conditional compilation, and macro expansion. The preprocessor language has a PL/I-like syntax with preprocessor statements and preprocessor procedures prefixed with a percent symbol (\`%\`). Listing- control statements, which supply formatting commands for the compiler listing, are usually considered preprocessor statements and also begin with \`%\`. Preprocessor statements are imbedded in and operate on input text. The input text is normally a PL/I program, but is agnostic to the grammar of PL/I, so the preprocessor can also be used independently to process other kinds of text files. The preprocessor is not specified as part of standard PL/I, but most PL/I implementations accept the language of the IBM preprocessor. Including files The \`%INCLUDE\` preprocessor statement is used to include the text of another file, which may also contain preprocessor directives. The latest IBM compilers also provide an \`%XINCLUDE\` directive, which has the effect of including the specified file only if it has not already been included. \`%INSCAN\` and \`%XINSCAN\` operate similarly, except that the name of the file to be included is specified by a preprocessor expression. Listing control Listing control statements provide instructions for formatting both the listing generated by the preprocessor and the listing generated by the compiler. * causes the printing of listings of the following text to be started or resumed. * causes the printing of the listings of the following text to be suppressed. * causes a new page to be started in the listings. * causes n lines to be skipped in the listings. If n is omitted the default is one line. *, save and restore the current status of / on a pushdown stack and restore it, respectively. Preprocessor operation The preprocessor operates by scanning the input text and recognizing declared preprocessor names, also called preprocessor identifiers. The text is copied to the preprocessor output with the preprocessor names replaced with their current values. The name may represent a call to a preprocessor procedure (macro). Replacement text may be rescanned by the preprocessor for possible additional replacement. Preprocessor data types Preprocessor data may be declared to be \`CHARACTER\`, a character string with no maximum length, or \`FIXED\` an integer number of up to five decimal digits. A preprocessor builtin is a predefined procedure operating on preprocessor data. A preprocessor expression is an expression consisting only of preprocessor names, references to preprocessor procedures or builtins, and decimal or character constants. There are no \`BIT\` variables, but a \`BIT\` result may be obtained by comparison. The expression in \`%IF\` evaluates to \`BIT\`. All PL/I operators are allowed except exponentiation. Preprocessor statements * establishes an identifier as a preprocessor variable, either or . *%assignment assigns a value to a preprocessor identifier. * makes a preprocessor identifier active, that is, eligible for replacement when encountered in the input text. * makes a preprocessor ineligible for replacement. * heads a preprocessor -group, which is used to group statements and possibly specify iteration. A preprocessor -group can contain any combination of preprocessor statements and input text. * heads a preprocessor procedure, a set of preprocessor statements that functions as a macro returning a value when its name is encountered in the input text. * heads a preprocessor -group. * terminates a preprocessor -group, -group, or preprocessor procedure. * (or ) causes the preprocessor to continue its scan at the specified preprocessor label, either a preprocessor statement or an arbitrary point in the input text. * controls the flow of the preprocessor scan according to the value of a preprocessor expression. %IF preprocessor-expression %THEN preprocessor unit1 %ELSE preprocessor-unit2 The preprocessor-units can be any single preprocessor statement or a preprocessor -group. * transfers control to the of the containing preprocessor -group, ending the current iteration and beginning the next if needed. * terminates any remaining iterations of the containing preprocessor -group transfers control to the . * generates a user-specified preprocessor diagnostic message. * is a preprocessor statement consisting only of an optional statement label and a semicolon (). It does nothing, but serves as a place-holder where a required statement is not needed. * allows immediate replacement of a name by a character or fixed expression. The name does not have to be a declared preprocessor identifier. Preprocessor procedures A preprocessor procedure is a subroutine executed by the preprocessor. The procedure is delimited by \`%PROCEDURE\` and \`%END\` statements and can contain only preprocessor statements, without the leading \`%\`. It is invoked as a function reference from open code, outside of any preprocessor procedure, or from another preprocessor procedure, and returns a \`CHARACTER\` or \`FIXED\` value. When the procedure is invoked from open code the arguments are passed by name, that is they are interpreted as character strings delimited by commas or a right parenthesis, all leading, trailing, or embedded blanks are significant and considered part of the argument. Preprocessor built-ins These are the built-ins for IBM's PL/I for MVS and VM compiler. There can be considerable difference in the built-ins provided among preprocessors of various PL/I compilers. * -- returns the date and time of compilation as a character string such as \\"15 SEP 12 15:30:00\\" for September 15, 2012 3:30PM (local time). * -- returns a character string containing a number that is \\"00001\\" for the first call to and increases by one for each subsequent call. * -- same as PL/I builtin . * -- same as PL/I builtin . * -- returns if the argument was set in the current call to this preprocessor procedure, otherwise . * -- same as PL/I builtin . Example The following example for IBM PL/I for OS/2 illustrates the use of a preprocessor procedure to implement a C-like write statement for PL/I. The procedure would be called by coding the statement is optional and defaults to the length of if omitted. %uwrite: procedure keys (File, From, Count); dcl (File, From, Count, Number, Size) char; if parmset(File) & parmset(From) then; else do; note ('FILE and FROM must be specified!', 12); return; end; if parmset(Count) then Size = 'min(length(' |From |'), ' |Count |')'; else Size = 'length(' |From |')'; Number = Counter(); ans ('do;'); ans ('dcl Count' |Number |' fixed bin (15);' ) skip; ans ('Count' |Number |' = filewrite(' |File |', ptradd(addr(' |From |'), 2)' |', ' |Size |');') skip; ans ('end;') skip; %end; %act uwrite; The statement generates the following: do; dcl Count00001 fixed bin (15); Count00001 = filewrite(file_name, ptradd(addr(var_str), 2), min(length(var_str), 64)); end; Evolution A 1964 report on \\"NPL\\", as PL/I was called at the time, provided that macro procedures, identified by the keyword \`MACRO\`, could use the complete facilities of the language. The following compile-time statements were allowed in open code: * \`%DECLARE\` - both fixed-length and varying character strings were defined. * \`%assignment\` * \`%null statement\` * \`%IF compile_time_comparison THEN unit [ELSE unit]\` - this causes one or the other unit to be included in the source. * \`%GOTO\` \\"NPL\\" as defined in this manual was never implemented. In 1965 an update to IBM's PL/I Language specification defined an even less ambitious preprocessor language. All mention of preprocessor procedures was omitted. The following compile-time statements were specified: * \`%DECLARE\` * \`%assignment\` * \`%null statement\` * \`%IF compile_time_comparison THEN GOTO label\` - No \`ELSE\` clause was defined. * \`%GOTO\` This language specification was again never implemented, however a 1966 revision of this manual restored preprocessor procedures with the now- current syntax and brought the specification close to what was actually included in PL/I(F). Fixed-length character variables were gone. New statements added were: * \`%ACTIVATE\` * \`%DEACTIVATE\` * \`%DO [preprocessor_variable = preprocessor_expression TO preprocessor_expression [BY preprocessor_expression \` * \`RETURN\` in a compile-time procedure only. * \`%INCLUDE\` * \`%IF\` - the \`IF compile_time_comparison THEN unit [ELSE unit]\` was restored. A single compile-time builtin, \`SUBSTR\`, was added. Also in 1966 Robert Rosin published a pair of articles discussing development of the preprocessor. This development was based in a \\"SHARE XXVI Memo\\" from earlier the same year and a paper by Mark Elson. Rosin credits MAD as the only previous example of a macro processor in a high-level language.

His death is now commonly used as a lesson taught to members of the military about the importance of accountability and responsibility. Death Rother was assigned to Kilo Company, Third Battalion, Second Marine Regiment, Second Marine Division (K 3/2) based out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In August 1988, the unit was sent to the massive Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms (MCAGCC) for desert warfare training in the Mojave desert. First Lt Allen Lawson, a native of Flint, Michigan, was assigned the task of posting road guards on the night of August 30, 1988, along the route position of a battalion night movement exercise. Lawson disobeyed the order to place road guards in pairs, got lost, forgot where he had placed LCpl Rother, and upon the completion of the exercise failed to mention that Rother was missing, as did two sergeants responsible for LCpl Rother, Sgts Thomas Turnell, and Christopher Clyde. Over 40 hours had passed without anyone in the battalion knowing or saying that Rother was missing, when an armory weapons inventory got the chain of command's attention due to LCpl Rother's weapon not having been returned. Several searches were launched with over 1,000 Marines on foot, helicopters, and thermal imaging gear. Rother was not carrying a map or compass, had very little water, and weighed only . The first search discovered he had left behind some of his gear and made an arrow out of stones where he had originally been dropped off. That search, and several others, however, failed to locate him. LCpl Rother's remains would not be found until December 4, four months after his disappearance. All that was left were skeletal remains. It was believed that Rother likely died less than 24 hours before the first search was launched and that the temperature on the day had reached . Tracing the distance, it was found that Rother had hiked over and was only from the base. Fallout The Marine Corps commandant, General Al Gray, was highly displeased with an initial report that he thought was largely a coverup by the battalion. He ordered an outside investigation which resulted in the courts-martial of 1stLt Lawson, Sgt Turnell, and Sgt Clyde. It was revealed that Lt Lawson had four convictions for driving while intoxicated and had previously tried to resign his commission, but was denied. It was not, however, known if Lawson's problems with alcohol contributed to this situation. During the trial several Marines stated they had objected to Lawson's decision to place road guards without partners, but he overruled them as he was senior in rank. Lawson was found guilty of dereliction of duty and sentenced to discharge and four months' confinement in the brig. Sgts Turnell and Clyde were both found guilty and were demoted to LCpl, thus ending their Marine Corps careers. Additionally, the battalion commander, LtCol Robeson, and executive officer, Maj Holm, were both relieved of their duties. Robeson would die less than two years later in an accident on his North Carolina farm. Present day Lance Corporal Rother is buried in the Fort Snelling National Cemetery in his hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The death of LCpl Rother is now one that is familiar to many in the Marine Corps as it is often taught as a lesson of warning on the importance of accountability. His death is especially taught in desert survival classes that all Marines stationed at 29 Palms attend annually. There are no markers to indicate where LCpl Rother was placed by Lt Lawson, nor a memorial marker for where his remains were found.

As chief of police (Polizeipr√§sident) in Wuppertal, he oversaw Kemna concentration camp until he was removed from his post. He was later sent to the east front, where he died fighting in Bred≈´nai (also known as Bredauen or Jagodne) in the district of Gumbinƒó (Regierungsbezirk Gumbinnen, Nesterov), East Prussia, in 1941.  Life and work  Wilhelm Veller, known as Willi, was born in Witten, Province of Westphalia as the son of an independent businessman. After attending Volksschule and the Oberrealschule, he enlisted and fought at the beginning of World War I. He was wounded three times and promoted to sergeant. He was named an officer candidate in 1915. In 1916, became a prisoner of war in Russia, where he was held in prison in Siberia. He was able to flee after the Russian Revolution and return to Germany, where he returned to his old regiment. While on leave, he enrolled at the University of Bonn, where he later received a doctorate in philosophy. In August 1918, he joined the replacement pilots division in Altenburg. After the war, Veller returned home and worked in his father's business, taking it over in 1928, after his father died. He went bankrupt in 1930. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924 and became a member of the Sturmabteilung, better known by as the SA. Veller reached the rank of an SA Brigade F√ºhrer and was named the SA F√ºhrer for the D√ºsseldorf sub-district. During the later years of the Weimar Republic, Veller, then SA F√ºhrer, took part in numerous political beer hall brawls, street fights and fisticuffs, both with political opponents and rivals within the Nazi movement. Later, bragging to Gregor Strasser in a February 1933 letter, he wrote that during the Weimar era, he political activities caused him to be brought before court more than thirty times, eight for assault and battery.Hans-Ulrich Thamer: Verf√ºhrung und Gewalt. Deutschland 1933-1945. Die Deutschen und ihre Nation, (1986), p. 181 Karl Ibach described Veller in his street fighting days as a \\"ruthless cutthroat\\".Karl Ibach: Kemna. Wuppertaler Konzentrationslager 1933-1934 (1983), p. 26 In November 1929, Veller became a city councilor in Wuppertal, remaining until 1933. In the 1930 federal election, Veller was a Nazi Party candidate for election district 22 (D√ºsseldorf east) and was elected to the Reichstag and remained a member until November 1933. The most important event in which Veller took part as an elected representative was the passage of the Enabling Act of March 1933, which formed the legal basis for the establishment of the Nazi dictatorship.  Nazi era: 1933‚Äì1941  In July 1933, Veller was named Acting Chief of Police in Wuppertal. In this capacity, he organized the pursuit of local political opponents of Nazism and, using violence and terror, carried out the Gleichschaltung in the municipality. Ibach described the authority that Veller enjoyed at this provincial level, characterizing him as \\"Wuppertal's little G√∂ring\\". At the same time, Veller was appointed SA Brigade F√ºhrer and a month later, commissioned to lead Wuppertal's SA Brigade 72. As head of the local SA, Veller had the Kemna concentration camp set up in an empty textile factory in the Barmen district of Wuppertal. The Nazi Party's political opponents, including Veller's own opponents, were moved to the new camp from various locations in the region, where the mass of arrests following the Reichstag fire quickly began to overwhelm the capacity of jails and prisons. Prisoners were held in makeshift holding cells located wherever the SA could find space, in schools, churches, barracks, even the cellar where Veller's own offices were located in Schloss J√§gerhof in the middle of D√ºsseldorf, where Veller had his SA staff guards torture the prisoners. At least one person was killed, his body dumped at the Bever Dam.David Magnus Mintert, Das fr√ºhe Konzentrationslager Kemna und das sozialistische Milieu im Bergischen Land (PDF) Ruhr University Bochum, doctoral dissertation (2007), pp. 129‚Äì130. Retrieved January 14, 2012 Kemna opened in July 1933 and immediately began beating and tormenting the prisoners. Both the guards and their superiors, including Veller, drank heavily, and the worst of the beatings occurring when the guards were inebriated. Screaming emanating from the camp was clearly audible to those living and working nearby and rumors began circulating in Wuppertal about the torture of prisoners by the SA guards, which in turn led to pressure to close the camp. Directed by Adolf Hitler, on December 15, 1933, SA Gruppenf√ºhrer Heinrich Knickmann placed Veller and seven other senior Wuppertal SA leaders in \\"honorary detention\\" and on administrative leave. On February 15, 1934, he was relieved of his position as Wuppertal SA Standarte and demoted, accused of embezzling Party funds and of corruption. He was transferred to Dresden, to the staff of SA Obergruppe 4 with the rank of SA Standartenf√ºhrer. In March 1934, he was relieved of his responsibilities as Wuppertal police chief.Joachim Lilla, Martin D√∂ring: Statisten in Uniform. Die Mitglieder des Reichstags 1933‚Äì1945. Droste, D√ºsseldorf (2004), p. 683. After the Night of the Long Knives, an investigation was undertaken by the state's attorney and Veller and six other SA men were expelled from the Nazi Party for mistreatment of prisoners in protective custody. After an appeal by Veller, the decision was reversed by the Nazi Party's highest court in Munich in hearings on February 19 and 20, 1935. Instead, Veller's punishment was reduced to a warning.Helmut Heiber: Akten der Parteikanzlei der NSDAP (1983), p. 56 The case never went to trial and Gustav Winckler, the attorney who initiated the investigation, was transferred to another city. The case was closed as Winckler's superior recommended its suppression.Mintert (2007), pp. 220-224 From January to December 1936, Veller was the SA Standarte 211 in the Pommern SA group, and beginning on July 30, he was the Oberf√ºhrer. On January 1, 1937, he began leading SA Brigade 22 in K√ºstrin. In April 1938, he tried unsuccessfully to be proposed for the party list for the Reichstag. In November 1939, he became the police chief in Oberhausen. While officially continuing in this capacity, on September 3, 1940, he was sent to the eastern front, where he served as a sergeant and a platoon leader. Veller was killed in battle in Bred≈´nai (also known as Jagodne) in the district of Gumbinƒó on June 22, 1941, at the start of Operation Barbarossa.

The vehicle existed only in prototype form and was cancelled in favor of the T-10 tank. Design and production The IS-7 heavy tank design began in Leningrad in 1945 by Nikolai Fedorovich Shashmurin Weighing 68 tonnes, thickly armoured and armed with a 130 mm S-70 long-barrelled gun, it was the largest and heaviest member of the IS family and one of the most advanced heavy tank designs. The armour was engineered in a similar fashion to the IS-3, with a pike nose on the upper glacis sporting 150mm of armor sloped at 65¬∞. This armor was designed to defeat rounds from the Jagdtiger's 12.8 cm Pak 44 from as close as . The lower glacis was designed to be 100mm but a measure taken by Nicholas Moran found it to be as thick as 110-120mm depending on welding variations. The armor on the sides was also 150mm on the upper side plate and 100mm on the lower side plate. Behind the lower side plate inflatable bags could hold fuel. The turret mantlet was 350mm thick and the turret itself between 240-250mm angled at 50-60 degrees. When shot at frontally, the extreme angle that the pike nose presents results in a much higher likelihood of a ricochet. Thus, the armour protection could be enhanced without having to use excessive amounts of materials. However, if the pike nose was shot at a sideways angle, it would not have a relative thickness high enough to ricochet the shell. The tank's interior has a \\"V\\" shape seen from the front of the tank, so that the side armor was spaced. And also, it's bottom armor was Wide V shaped hull. It looks like developer wanted to protect the tank from Anti-Tank Mine this hull style also used in Obj.257 heavy tank. Obj.257's shape is little bit narrower then IS-7 but it was wide angle V-shape too. And IS-7 had 68t of weight and most of weight was caused by it's armor. In spite of its weight, it was easy to drive due to numerous hydraulic assists. The loaders noted that the IS-7 was comfortable and that the autoloader was easy to use. It was also able to achieve a top speed of 60 km/h thanks to a 1050-horsepower diesel engine based on aircraft diesel based torpedo boat engine giving it a power to weight ratio of 15.4 hp/tonne, a ratio superior to most contemporary medium tanks. Its armour was not only immune to the Jagdtiger's 12.8 cm Pak 44 but was even proof to its own 130 mm. Due to the unknown reasons, most likely because of the considerable issues arising from its mass (bridges, rail transport - no Soviet/Russian tank accepted into service afterwards exceeded 55 t), the tank never reached the production lines. The 130 mm S-70 was a conversion of a naval gun, firing a ~ armor piercing round ~ The loading mechanism for the gun was an assisted loading mechanism with a conveyor belt system. It held six ready rounds that would then have to be refilled. The rounds came in two parts: shell and propellant. The IS-7 had a massive number of machine guns (eight) and probably would have lost five of them if it had entered production, according to Nicholas Moran. However, the IS-7 was, heavy, expensive, and while an excellent break-though vehicle that was all it was good at, the T-10 was better suited for longer battles and warfare as well as being easier and cheaper to transport. Work on the IS-7 ceased in 18 February 1949 The tracks were specially made for the IS-7 (compared to closer similarities between the other IS series tanks). The track was the first Soviet track to use rubber bushings with single pins, retained in place by bolts. The IS-7 has a total of seven road wheels attached to road wheel arms on torsion bars, limited by volute spring bump stops, and hydraulic shock absorbers. The rear allowed for external fuel tanks to be carried.

A mother and child were killed in Oregon after the car they were in slid into a creek, while a man was killed in the Seattle area. About 200,000 homes were without power in the Greater Seattle area after the storm. Meteorological synopsis The storm was first noted just off the coast of British Columbia on January 16, with a central pressure of . The center of the low pressure area had then moved south to about off the Oregon Coast. At the same time, the storm had attained peak intensity of . The storm then began to move closer to the coastline, and by 2000 UTC on January 18, the storm was located about off the coast of Washington. By 0200 UTC the next day, of snow had already fallen in Stanley, Idaho. Impact United States The National Weather Service (NWS) began issuing severe weather warnings for the whole of the Pacific Northwest on January 17 and 18. A hurricane-force wind warning was issued for offshore Oregon at about 1600 UTC on January 18. A storm warning was also issued for parts of California and Oregon. Numerous flights were cancelled due to heavy snow and rain. The NWS office in Missoula, Montana, said that this storm ranked in the top seven of the top snowfall events in the area. Interstate 5 near Centralia, Washington, was closed temporarily due to powerlines brought down by snowfall; the standard detour route was also blocked by trees and powerlines. Amtrak service between Portland and Seattle was canceled due to trees and debris left on tracks. More than 12 Oregon highways were closed due to storm damage, and many more were partly closed. Oregon Route 213 near Molalla closed for several days due to an undermined roadbed beside a culvert.

It is widespread in much of Canada (from Alberta to Nova Scotia) and the northern United States (from New England to Washington, with additional populations in Colorado and New Mexico). Description Ribes americanum is a shrub growing 0.5 to 1.5 meters (20-60 inches) in height. The branches are erect and bear deciduous leaves. There are no spines. The plant may form thickets. The glandular leaves are up to long and have 3 or 5 lobes. They turn red and gold in the fall. The inflorescence is a spreading or drooping raceme of up to 15 flowers. Each flower has reflexed white or greenish sepals a few millimeters long and smaller whitish petals. The fruit is a smooth rounded black berry about a centimeter (0.4 inch) wide and edible when cooked. The plant reproduces mostly by seed. Distribution and habitat This shrub is native to the United States and Canada where grows in a variety of ecosystems. It occurs in many types of forests and in conifer bogs. In Manitoba it can be found in marshes. In the Great Lakes region it grows abundantly in sedge meadows (Carex spp.). Ribes americanum grows on plains and in mountains and sometimes in disturbed areas such as roadsides. It is also shade-tolerant, growing in the understory of closed-canopy woodlands and forests. It has also been introduced to northern China. Ecology Several bee species visit the flowers: Augochlora pura, Augochlorella aurata, Ceratina calcarata, Ceratina dupla, and Ceratina strenua. This plant is an alternate host for the white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), the vector of a pine tree disease. It is sometimes eradicated in attempts to control the rust. The cluster cup rust (Puccinia caricina) forms aecia on the leaves of Ribes americanum in the spring, later developing brown blotches of pustules. The telia are formed on sedges (Carex). Uses Native Americans made pemmican from the berries, which are also known for being made into jam and jelly.

Career Blanthorne began his career at his local side, Rock Ferry, and was there from 1900 to 1904. He then joined Birkenhead, where he attracted the interest of Liverpool. He was a regular scorer for their reserves scoring 22 goals in the 1905/06 season, and then 17 goals in the following season. He made two first team appearances against Bristol City on 13 April 1907, and Middlesbrough on 17 April 1907, scoring once. Blanthorne was criticised at Anfield because he lacked 'speed and dash'. He was transferred to Grimsby Town the following October. Blanthorne was involved in a 'giant-killing' in the FA Cup as Grimsby beat Bristol City 2‚Äì1 in a first round replay, with the Merseysider getting on the scoresheet. In the second round, Grimsby faced Carlisle United, and beat them 6‚Äì2, with Blanthorne netting five of the six goals. After dispatching Crystal Palace in the third round, the Mariners travelled up to Tyneside to face Blanthorne's future employers Newcastle United. However, Grimsby's cup run came to an end at St. James' Park, as they were thrashed 5‚Äì1. Blanthorne turned down the chance to sign for Hull City, before joining Newcastle United in May 1908, for a ¬£350 fee. However, his competitive club debut in the season opener against Bradford City, the following September ended in disaster. Blanthorne was on the ball, and Fred Farren, the opposing left back, rushed in to tackle him. The players had a severe collision, and Blanthorne fell to the ground with a broken leg. This was to be Blanthorne's only appearance for the Magpies. Returning to fitness and making a comeback for the reserves in January 1910, Blanthorne moved to Hartlepools United and scored on his debut against Carlisle United in January 1911. However, he managed just five more games, and scoring two more times, before retiring due to injury. He later returned to the Birkenhead area, and his death was recorded there during 1965.

It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. History The painting seems to be the one which was in the Cardinal Mazarin Collection in 1653. It was given to Louis XIV in 1693, together with its companion piece, A Seaport, by the French architect and gardener Andr√© Le N√¥tre. It was acquired by the Louvre in 1911.Cf. the Louvre Catalogue, and their respective webpage. The painting depicts Apollo, accompanied by infant Cupids and by one of the Muses, about to crown a poet who is writing under his inspiration. It is not known to what the painting alludes, nor what is its exact subject. Perhaps the latter was always indefinite, because the picture appears in Mazarin's inventory of 1653 as Apollo with a Muse and a Poet crowned with Laurels. Its warm colouring reveals the Titianesque strain in Poussin's work; it must have been painted during his first Roman period, at the end of the 1620s. Several other paintings of this period are related to this work: The Inspiration of Anacreon, the Parnassus, and the book frontispiece drawn by Poussin and engraved by Claude Mellan for an edition of Virgil published by the Imprimerie Royale in 1641‚Äì1642. Some critics put forward the hypothesis that the model for the Muse, often recognizable in other works of this period by Poussin, may have been Anna Dughet, whom he married in 1630 at San Lorenzo in Lucina (Rome).F.

Intended to exploit a growing understanding of thermal soaring, it was small and manoeuvrable, with a 12 m span; silk-covered for lightness, it weighed less (empty) than its pilots. It held the world straight-line distance record for a time in 1934. Design and development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their university. They began with gliders optimised for hill soaring with long span, high aspect ratio wings. By the early 1930s, partly through the experiences of the Darmstadt Musterle in the US, there was a better understanding of \\"blue\\" thermals and the Darmstadt group sought to exploit these small, weak currents with a light, manoeuvrable aircraft that could stay within their rising columns. The result was the D-28 Windspiel, combining a 12 m (39 ft 4 in) span with the lowest weight achievable with the plywood and fabric materials of the time. The D-28 was a wood-framed aircraft with a high, cantilever, single-spar wing, Akaflieg's established layout. It utilised the high-lift-to-drag ratio G√∂ttingen 535 profile that Akaflieg had used on the Konsul and Darmstadt, though thinned by 10% to reduce drag. The structure also followed Akaflieg's previous use of wooden frames and stress-bearing plywood skin on the fuselage and leading edges of flying surfaces, with fabric covering elsewhere, but with greater attention to precision, the removal of unneeded material and metering of adhesives. The wing leading edge ply was only 1 mm (0.039 in) thick, and the fuselage was constructed without longerons. Instead of the standard aircraft linen, for lightness the Windspiel was covered in silk. The empty weight of the completed Windspiel was 55.5 kg (112 lb), a good deal less than that of most of its pilots. In plan, the wing was straight-tapered with elliptical tips. The whole of the trailing edge was occupied by camber- changing flaperons, attached to selected ribs rather than to a subsidiary spar as usual, another weight-saving measure. The hinge gap was sealed with 500 Œºm (0.02 in) ply strips. The wing was mounted, as with several earlier Akaflieg sailplane, on a narrow, faired pylon, with the cockpit in front of it and under the leading edge. The upper fuselage from the nose to the front of the pylon was detachable in a single piece, together with the cellophane single curvature glazing, so the pilot could access the cockpit. The Windspiel's fuselage was slender and oval in cross section, with a short skid under the centre section and small tail bumper as an undercarriage. The horizontal tail was straight-tapered, with the tailplane fixed to the top of the fuselage and carrying elevators with a central cut-out for rudder movement. The tall, straight-edged rudder was an all-moving one, but of an unusual design, divided vertically into two sections, with the front part carrying the rear surface. When the front surface moved, the larger-area, deeper rear surface further deflected by the same amount again, presenting a cambered surface. As on the Konsul, the rudder and ailerons were interconnected to ease yaw correction in turns. The date of the first flight is uncertain, but building was planned to start over the winter of 1931‚Äì32, and the Windspiel was performing record flights by early 1934. As its careful construction was slow, taking some 7,000 hours, a 1933 date is plausible. In flight it achieved the tight turns required to stay within small thermals; a medium-level turn with a bank angle of 25¬∞ produced an 80 m (260 ft) radius circle. After its 1935 accident and rebuild, the Windspiel was a little heavier, but the only major alteration was the separation of the full-span flaperons into inboard flaps and outboard ailerons. Operational history On 16 June 1934 the Windspiel, piloted by Hans Fischer, set a new world glider straight-line distance record of 240 km (149 mi) with a flight from Griesheim, Darmstadt to Thonneheim, Montm√©dy in France. On 9 June 1935 Fischer demonstrated the manoeuvrability of the Windspiel at an aircraft display day organised by the Aero Club de Portugal at the Amadora airfield near Lisbon. Glider aerobatics were a novelty at the time. The accident which led to the rebuild as the D-28B occurred at Griesheim in 1935. The D-28 was on the ground with Fischer aboard when an aircraft landed on the glider. It was wrecked but Fischer escaped with bruising. Rebuilt about 12% heavier, it was still capable of good performance. Hans Osann flew it from Darmstadt into the Netherlands, a distance of 275 km (171 mi). At the ISTUS meeting at Salzburg in 1937, he was one of a group to fly across the Alps. Later the D-28B was one of a group of sailplanes that pioneered thermal soaring in the Sahara. Though it flew well enough, this experiment with a very light glider did not lead to a new sailplane class. Its performance was not superior to larger, long-span aircraft which were cheaper to build and more robust in the air and on the ground. Variants ;D-28: Original version. ;D-28b: Result of rebuild after ground accident. About 16 kg (35 lb) heavier, flaps and aileron separated.
