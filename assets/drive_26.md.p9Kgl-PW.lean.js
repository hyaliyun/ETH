It was launched on 2010 on the Facebook social media platform, it was the first game of the genre in Facebook. It was launched for Android and IOS in 2012. Gameplay Mystery Manor is a hidden object (sometimes known as hidden picture) game. Players are given a list of items to find within a static scene. They then receive points for each item found, and score multipliers for completing the task quickly. Players can also use compasses to highlight items that they find difficult to see, snails to add time or hourglasses to freeze time. In between many of the levels, puzzle levels require players to find and assemble the collections of the manor. Mystery Manor also has a map of the manor, in which players see the keys required to visit the rooms. Sometimes there are quest in the yard of the manor. Coins, jewels and experience are needed to unlock further rooms and floors in the game. Players must also defeat, trade with, or banish monsters in order to protect the manor. New chapters of the story are written every season (winter in the manor, summer in the manor, Christmas in the manor). Each room in the Manor cycles through multiple ‚ÄúExploration Modes.‚Äù * Word mode - Provides a list with the names of the objects that have to be found. * Silhouette mode - Provides a list with the black outlines of the objects that have to be found. * Night Mode - Provides a list with the names of the objects that have to be found and keeps most of the screen darkened, except for a player-controlled spotlight. * Comparison Mode - Provides two side by side images of the room, with the goal being to ‚Äúspot the difference‚Äù between the two images. Narrative Mystery Manor is set in the mansion of Mister X, a large and isolated house full of secrets and strange phenomena. A no-named visitor (the player) arrives to the manor and meets Katherine, Mister X¬¥s secretary, who tells him/her about the game. Characters * Mr. and Mrs. X: the mysterious owners of the manor. * Katherine: the secretary, she helps you in the quests. She wants to escape out of the manor. * Elsa: the German maid, she is almost always frightened. * Giovanni: the Italian chef, he always wants you to find some ingredient.

Niveo-aeolian or cryo-aeolian deposition is the process by which fine-grained sediments are transported by wind and deposited on or mixed with snow or ice. The wind sweeps the snow and sand grains into aeolian forms such as ripples, and further sorts the snow and ice grains into distinct layers When snow melts or sublimates, the sediments are redeposited onto the surface below., forming patterns known as denivation features. Niveo-aeolian deposition is most widespread in polar climates, but may be found anywhere that is at least seasonally below freezing. In most places, much or all of the snow in these niveo-aeolian deposits melts in the spring or summer. However, \\"perennial\\" niveo-aeolian deposits have been observed in Antarctica's Victoria Valley. Initially, after the wind has deposited it, the surface of a niveo-aeolian deposit typically consists of a rippled bedform of mixed sand and snow. Beneath the surface, the deposits commonly consist of alternating layers of snow and sediment. These layers may be up to thick. However, sometimes the sediment and snow are intermingled without distinct layers. Niveo-aeolian deposition plays an important role in soil transport in cold climates, such as the formation of loess soils in Alaska through the deposition of windblown silt. Further south, in coastal landscapes of the Laurentian Great Lakes, niveo-aeolian deposition facilitates the transport of sand into lakes and marshes, thus enhancing the sand signal. The prolonged denivation process also creates a source of fresh water, in the otherwise extremely dry dune and beach environment, for months after all surface snow has melted. Cryo-aeolian deposition has been proposed as one explanation for certain landforms on the planet Mars. In particular, denivation has been suggested as a cause of apparent meltwater fans in Kaiser Crater. Proposed terrestrial analogs for these Martian landscapes include the Victoria Valley in Antarctica and the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes in Alaska.  Denivation  A sand-covered section of Lake Michigan shelf ice, showing stress cracks and meltwater fan from denivation. During denivation, any outer snow melts first, so that the outer surface of the remaining niveo-aeolian deposit consists of sand. This surface sand exhibits tensional surface cracks due to the continued melting of the underlying snow. Denivation features may take several forms, including \\"snow ramparts\\" formed by slumping down a dune or hill slope, thermokarstic sinkholes caused by melting below the surface, hummocks caused by sediment draped over the remaining ice, spongy surfaces caused by the collapse of the sand and snow layers, and debris flows caused by meltwater. Smaller features include pellets, cracks, and dimples. Denivation features typically disrupt aeolian patterns only temporarily. After all the snow or ice has melted or sublimated, continued wind action gradually destroys them.

The municipality was established on 1 January 2017 by merger of the former communes of Saint-Lupicin (the seat) and Cuttura.Arr√™t√© pr√©fectoral 4 July 2016  Geography  Coteaux du Lizon is a little town located in the Parc naturel r√©gional du Haut-Jura in Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√©, Eastern France. The city is cut in two parts by the narrow but deep valley of the Lizon, a small river about 7 km long that cuts a little canyon in the vicinity of Coteaux du Lizon. The commune also has two vast coombs, one of which is towards the hamlet of \\"Grande-Maison\\" on the heights of the commune at the foot of the Roche d'Antre, which has climatic characteristics close to those of the coombs of la Br√©vine or Mouthe. Coteaux du Lizon is surrounded by the Roche d'Antre massif to the west and by the little mountains on which Avignon-l√®s-Saint- Claude is situated to the east. Although it is in the Haut-Jura, none of the peaks in the territory of the municipality exceeds 1000 m, but nevertheless, at 5 km to the south, there is the Cr√™t de Surmontant, which peaks at 1065 m. Note that the maximum altitude of its canton is near Lamoura at the Cr√™t Pela, culminating at 1495m. The Lizon is the main watercourse crossing the commune. There is also the Cuttura dam, a small water reserve located between Cuttura and Saint-Lupicin. There are many small mountain streams in the municipality.  Climate  Due to its altitude, Coteaux du Lizon features a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen : Dfb), bordering on an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen : Cfb). High precipitations are present all the year, which are a particularity of Coteaux du Lizon's climate. Only two seasons are long : winter and summer. Summers are very warm, with many thunderstorms, sometimes with hail and winters are moderately cold and very snowy from the altitude point of view. The rain, which is abundant and evenly distributed throughout the year, can be absent for a long time, the most recent example (which took place in 2020) is a rain-free period that lasted from March 11 to April 20 (so that's 41 days in a row without rain). This is certainly the longest period without rain ever seen in Coteaux-du-Lizon. Clairvaux-les-Lacs is the village which has the nearest climate with Coteaux du Lizon (except for the snowfall and the snow cover). The heat record is 40.1 ¬∞C, recorded on July 25, 2019. The cold record is estimated at -30.1 ¬∞C on February 10, 1956, so the difference between these two absolute records is 71 ¬∞C (a little reminder : the largest difference between two records in the world is in Verkhoyansk, Siberia and its 105 ¬∞C difference).

Paul Gilmartin's album \\"Reincarnated\\", featuring some early songs and many new ones, with lyrics by Gilmartin and scored by the band, was released in 2015. While this incarnation of the band gained momentum, extensively touring the UK and Europe, playing alongside such bands as Balaam And The Angel, Chameleons Vox, Spear Of Destiny and Theatre Of Hate, a legal battle started for the sole usage of the band name. During 2016 Brian Jay stepped aside to allow a new frontman, Jonathan \\"J\\" Cridford, to join the band. The \\"Reincarnated\\" tour continued, but as the tour drew to a close, the decision was made to change the band name, as Paul Gilmartin had lost the legal case against The Danse Society to gain the band name. See the Intellectual Property decision results for reference below for further details: https://www.ipo.gov.uk/t-challenge-decision- results/t-challenge-decision-results-bl?BL_Number=O/537/16 =The Future= At the start of 2017 \\"The Society\\" was born, in order to deliver Paul Gilmartin's legacy of the Danse Society's back catalogue of songs, as well as recording and performing new material.

Ficus carica played many important roles in history and has become a symbol in many different cultures and religions.  Origins of cultivation and domestication  The origin of the common fig is debated.Mordechai, Kislev E.; Anat Hartmann,; Ofer Bar-Yosef 2006 Early Domesticated Fig in the Jordan Valley. Science. 312(5778): 1372-1374 Some believe it to be indigenous to Western Asia and then spread by human activity throughout the Mediterranean.Siddiq, Muhammad. 2012. Tropically al and Subtropical Fruits: Postharvest Physiology, Processing and Packaging. Figs: 455-477 Despite uncertainty about its geographic origins, most archaeobotanists agree that the domestication of the fig tree occurred around 6500 years ago in the Near East. Scholars agree that the domestication of the fig tree came long before the domestication of other fruit crops like grapes, olives, and dates. Researchers have found significant evidence of fig cultivation at many different late Neolithic and Neolithic sites along with Bronze Age, Assyrian, and Egyptian sites.Janick, J. 2005. The Origins of Fruits, Fruit Growing, and Fruit Breeding: 18-20 But evidence for the first cultivation of figs has been found in the Lower Jordan Valley in an early Neolithic village known as Gilgal 1.Hooper, Rowan. 2006. Figs Came First, New Scientist 190(2555): 1 This evidence dates back to the 12th millennium BP and suggests that the widespread cultivation of figs pre-dated the domestication of cereal crops by almost one thousand years. Ficus carica specimens made ideal candidates for domestication because they are one of the most easily proliferated of all fruit trees. By simply planting a seed, or by cutting off either a limb of the fig tree or a part the fruit itself may result in an entirely new individual tree.Eisen, Gustav. 1901. The Fig: Its History, Culture, and Curing, With Descriptive Catalog of the Known Varieties of Fig The ability to produce many more plants in such a straightforward manner may have appealed to the early consumers of figs, as would the fruit's ability to withstand harsh, varying temperatures.Tous, J. and Louise Ferguson.1996. Mediterranean Fruits: 416-430 Along with their rigidity, Ficus carica trees produce 3 crops throughout the year, so the yield from these plants would be significantly worth the effort put into growing them. Figs also contain a large amount of sugar. Perhaps the sweetness of these fruits also played a role in their domestication, as it would have made them more desirable to the human palate. During the domestication of fig trees, humans compromised the characteristics of the fruit and promoted evolutionary divergence from the wild ancestor of the plant. Intuitively, those growing the figs chose to let the plants with the most desirable characteristics reproduce. In this case, plants were selected towards an increase in the size of the overall fruit. Figs with various different flesh colors were also chosen so that there are now white-, amber-, red-, and purple-colored figs. The plants that produced the sweetest fruit were also selected, increasing the sugar content of the domesticated fig versus the wild fig. Those plants that produced fruits that did not split during maturation and harvest were considered ideal because they produced a higher, usable, crop yield with more diverse uses, being less fragile and easier to handle.  Smyrna figs  Smyrna figs need to be pollinated by a fig wasp, in contrast to Ficus carica, which reproduce without pollination. Figs and fig wasps have had a symbiotic relationship throughout history.Leong, B.M. 1891. Fig Caprification or The Setting of the Fruit: 1-33 The fig wasps need the figs in order to reproduce, while the figs rely on the wasps to aid them in their pollination.Denham, Tim. 2007. Early fig domestication, or gathering of wild parthenocarpic figs? Antiquity. 81(312): 457-461. Without pollination the fig will fall off of the tree without producing fruit. To secure their crop, fig farmers around the Mediterranean help in the caprification (the process of fig pollination). They aid this process by buying male figs from different regions that are already filled with fig wasps. They then string these figs together and hang them in their trees. When the fig wasps emerge, they pollinate the figs and allow them to mature. In this way, figs are reliant on human activities, which is representative of their domestication. Without human interference, they would not likely reach maturity. In the years prior to the 1900s, a problem arose for those who grew Smyrna figs outside of the Mediterranean. Fig wasps were only found in a very small portion of the world and there was no other known way to pollinate figs. In artificial caprification, the maturation of the figs is completely reliant on humans; fig wasps are entirely absent. Male figs are broken open, releasing their pollen. Toothpicks dusted with this pollen is then poked them into female figs, thus artificially pollinating them and allowing them to reach maturity. This process of artificial caprification was vital to the culture of figs in California until fig wasps were eventually imported into the state from Turkey. In this case, without the close interaction with humans, these figs would have never succeeded in this part of the world.  Historical significance  Fig trees and fig fruits have many different historical and cultural references. In art, fig leaves have been used to cover the sexual characteristics of muse, forming a representation of modesty and vulnerability. There are also many references to figs within the Bible. One example being, when Adam and Eve dress themselves with fig leaves after eating the forbidden fruit. Perhaps this suggesting that the leaves serve as some form of protection. They are also present in different aspects of Greek mythology. They are, for example, known as the sacred tree to the god Dionysus, god of wine and fertility. They appear within a portion of the Qur'an that is titled ‚ÄúThe Fig‚Äù in Arabic. It can also be found in another section of the Qur'an, in which the fig is referred to as ‚Äúa fruit that descended from paradise.‚Äù In Rome, figs were thought to represent femininity, due to the appearance of the fleshy inside of the fruit. In this society, figs were meant as a way of presenting weakness. In the sense, they appeared in a much more negative light than in other cultural contexts.  Dispersal  As time went on, figs were spread from their indigenous region of Western Asia, and their comfortable home in the Mediterranean, throughout many other places around the world (of course, despite their increasing ability to grow in many different regions, the Mediterranean still remains the ideal location for the raising of figs). They migrated into Afghanistan and expanded to southern Germany and the Canary Islands. They made their way to England and then China, and eventually to Japan, South Africa, India, Australia, the United States (California to be more specific.), and of course many other places around the globe. Figs soon found themselves woven into the economy of many different countries. The production, import, and export of figs is vital in some regions. For example, in 2010, Turkey was the number one exporter and producer of figs in the world, producing around 24% of the world's supply and exporting around 254, 838 metric tons. Egypt was the second largest producer, producing around 184,972 metric tons. Austria trailed Turkey as the second largest exporter, exporting somewhere near 6,131 metric tons. In 2009, France, Austria, and Germany were the top 3 importers of figs, with Canada trailing as number 4. The demand for figs has remained steady for many years and it looks as though it will stay that way for a while, or perhaps even increase, which would of course be good news for the countries that lead in the fig trade.  Modern uses  There are many different ways that people continue to consume fig fruits today. The most common forms of consumption are either dried, sliced, and then eaten, or dried and then made into a sticky paste which can then be used in a variety of different products. This is mostly because it is extremely hard to keep fresh figs, as they spoil within a very short amount of time. So, more often than not, if figs are to be consumed fresh then they must be eaten in the place which they are grown because they are unable to make the journey of exportation. It is for this reason that, for most of their history, around 95% of all the figs produced in the world were destined to be dried. However, despite the difficulties that they pose, the demand for fresh figs has recently greatly increased. From 2002 to 2006, the demand for fresh figs increased four-fold. Besides dried or fresh, figs are also sometimes canned and used in pastries and, although it is not commonly known, they can even be fermented and distilled into alcohol. It many places in the world, it is common to grind up the figs that either do not meet standards, or rot before they can be consumed, in order to make a sort of animal feed.

Development and context  Oates says that the novel started as a \\"dream vision\\" describing it as \\"I saw a woman sitting at a large table wearing inappropriate, very heavy makeup that had dried, like mud, and was darker than her skin.\\" Oates wrote the novel in response to the dream, and during a period that was hard for Oates: her husband died while she was drafting the novel. Kevin Nance of the Washington Post describes these two influences as creating a deeply autobiograhical novel.  Themes and style  The novel reflects on themes of memory and mental health. Oates includes autobiographical elements like she does in other novels, using the fictional exploration of the \\"brutal world of her childhood\\" as a means of probing her fictional protagonist's psyche. The novel starts with a \\"psychotic mother abandoning her two small girls to die\\", and that scene follows M.R. Neukirchen throughout the novel.

Peace and Freedom Party Factionalism  Under the influence of Gene Berkman, Eric Garris and Elizabeth Keathley, CLA continued to build left- right coalitions, taking leadership roles in the Peace and Freedom Party (PFP). CLA arranged for libertarian candidates to run on the PFP ticket in California, and sent a large group of delegates to the 1974 PFP convention in Sacramento. In the 1974 California Primary election, Elizabeth Keathley won a contested primary as the PFP gubernatorial candidate for the governor of California. But her candidacy was marred by socialist factions in the PFP who organized their own write-in alternative candidate. Keathley acknowledged this political infighting, remarking that ‚Äúher heart belongs to the libertarian cause, exemplified by the California Libertarian Alliance, rather than to the Peace and Freedom Party.Marion Mauk, ‚ÄúRadicals racing for votes,‚Äù Independent Press-Telegram (Long Beach), (May 19, 1974) p. 164 She received 75,000 votes in her run against Jerry Brown. Two years later, the CLA libertarian faction abandoned the PFP, announcing at a July 13, 1976 press conference in Los Angeles that the PFP had become ‚Äúdominated‚Äù by a ‚Äúsocialist faction‚Äù that gave the PFP the image of a ‚Äúpro-communist organization.‚ÄùCLA press release, ‚ÄúPeace & Freedom Activists Abandon Party!

Early life  O'Toole was born in Hacketstown, County Carlow, Ireland to Nicholas O'Toole and Brigid O'Toole (n√©e O'Connor). Her father Nicholas was imprisoned in Naas Gaol in 1882 because he was a follower of Charles Stewart Parnell's no-rents campaign. O'Toole emigrated to the United States at age 16. She was the first woman to be naturalised in Steuben County, New York, in 1900, and afterwards became the first woman to be appointed official stenographer in Steuben County.  Legal career  O'Toole studied at Washington College of Law, completing her Bachelor of Laws in 1908, and Master of Laws in 1914. She was first appointed Judge of the Municipal Court of Washington, D.C. by President Harding in 1921. At the time of her appointment, there were only three woman judges in the United States. In 1924, she was a delegate at a meeting of the American Bar Association, held in London. She was re-appointed to the Municipal Court by President Coolidge in 1925. O'Toole was a member of the board of trustees of the Washington College of Law, and held the position of Acting Dean of the College while Dean Grace Hays Riley attended the American Legion Convention in Paris in September 1927. In January 1928, E. E. Dudding, national president of the Prisoner's Aid Society, wrote to the Department of Justice nominating O'Toole to fill the vacancy on the bench of the District of Columbia Supreme Court caused by the resignation of Judge Adolph Hoehling, stating, \\"There is no better lawyer in Washington or anywhere else. She knows the law. She is judicial. She would make one of the best judges to be found and would, I think, raise public opinion of Federal courts\\". O'Toole was reappointed to the Municipal Court by President Hoover in 1929. In 1930, O'Toole was named one of the 50 women who had done the most for Washington by The Washington Post. Referring to O'Toole as a \\"pioneering woman member of the bench\\" and \\"a fixture in Washington's judiciary system\\", The Washington Post in 1934 reported on how, prior to her initial appointment, \\"the very mention of her name as a prospective member of the bench made usually dignified men pace the floor and use undignified language\\". In 1931, she was elected to the executive committee of the National Association of Women Lawyers, which her colleague Dr Ellen Spencer Mussey had helped found in 1919. She spoke at the Thirty-Seventh Annual Meeting of the National Association of Women Lawyers on 5 August 1936. O'Toole was also a member of the Phi Delta Delta Women's Legal Fraternity and the District of Columbia Women's Bar Association.  Views  = Capital punishment = In September 1929, The Washington Daily News reported that O'Toole was \\"one of the most ardent anti-capital punishment workers in the District [of Columbia]\\". She is stated to have said, \\"I am convinced that experience, history, and psychology teach us that the death penalty is wrong. In any event, it does not suit our times and the upward and onward progress of our civilisation. That we constantly try to mitigate its horrors for ourselves by seeking and selecting the least painful methods of inflicting it, by limiting the number of witnesses, and so on, is the sure argument for its abolishment\\". O'Toole led a successful campaign to have the Washington Chamber of Commerce go on record as opposing capital punishment. = Divorce = An interview with O'Toole was published in The Washington Post on February 26, 1928, under the headline \\"High Divorce Rate a Sign of Progress: Some Very Frank Opinions From a Woman on the Bench, Judge Mary O'Toole, of the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia, and Why She Does Not 'View With Alarm' Recent Increase in Marriage Breaks\\". She was quoted in the interview as saying, \\"A woman seeks divorce for one of three main reasons: To protect herself from a person no longer tolerable; to be free, perhaps to acquire other bonds; or to free her husband, her economic independence lulling the fear of want and poverty, so large a factor in the life of women of an earlier day\\". = Women's suffrage = O'Toole campaigned for women's suffrage in Washington, D.C., and wrote a column for a local newspaper that started, \\"Why do I favour suffrage for the District? As well ask me why I want to eat. One seems quite as obvious as the other\\".  Other interests  O'Toole was the first president of the Women's City Club of Washington, D.C. which was founded in 1919. On the club's ethos, O'Toole said the group hoped to attract not only women in the academic and professional sphere, but housewives as well. The Club's charter called for a \\"better understanding among women, and a place for women to meet and socialise\\". She was the first woman to be chosen as director of the Washington Chamber of Commerce, and was a director in the Citizens Savings Bank of Washington, D.C. O'Toole also had membership with the Sulgrave Institution, the Columbia Historical Society, the Catholic Actors Guild, the American Catholic History Association, the American Association of University Women, and the National Women's Republican Club (New York City).  Extended family  O'Toole's great-grandniece is Lucy Mulhall, captain of the Irish Women's Rugby sevens team.

Brice√±o's passion for photography began when he was a teenager and he first exhibited his work in 1987. Between 1996 and 2002, he carried out several solo exhibitions, relating to the following topics: Veils and Turbans (1996, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi); Passengers (a series that won him First Prize in the Luis Felipe Toro Prize and which was exhibited in Caracas' Museum of Fine Arts in 1997); Devotion (a series that depicts different forms of popular religious beliefs in Venezuela, which was shown at Galer√≠a Los Talleres, Mexico in 1998; in Casa de las Am√©ricas, Havana, 1999; and at Maison Internationale, Brussels in 2000); Guadalupanos (Ateneo de Caracas, 1999); and The Shamans (Galerie Adriana Schmidt, Stuttgart, 2002). Between 2001 and 2007, he worked on the project entitled Gods of America: Natural Pantheon, in which he used digital photomontage (carried out during long-term periods of field research), creating a pantheon of deities and mythological beings from indigenous cultures across the American continent. This project covered ten cultures from six countries: Huichol (Mexico 2001), Piaroa (Venezuela 2002), Kogui and Wiwa (Colombia 2003), Wayuu (Venezuela 2005), Kuna (Panama 2005), Quero (Peru 2005), Kayap√≥ (Brazil 2006), and Ye'Kuana and Pem√≥n (Venezuela 2007). He received several grants that allowed him to carry out the project, including grants from the Programa de Intercambio de Residencias Art√≠sticas (Grupo de los Tres G3), the Estancia para Creaci√≥n Art√≠stica Grant (Government of Mexico) and the Apoyo an Artistas Grant, (Centro Nacional de las Artes, Mexico). Gods of America represented Venezuela at the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007) and have been exhibited, in either solo or group shows, in Finland, France, Hungary, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, the United States,http://gabarron.org/NewYork/Exhibitions/PastExhibitions/SavetheForestSavetheCulture/Cover/tabid/257/Default.aspx Mexico, Colombia, New Zealand and Venezuela. The artist received the Green Leaf Award for Artistic Excellence 2008, awarded by the Natural World Museum and the United Nations Environment Program for this compelling series, in addition to various other prizes and highly commented awards in his home country, Venezuela. In 2008, Brice√±o carried out a project entitled The Tree, in which he photographed the New Zealand Maori's worship of forefathers. Afterwards, in 2009, the Colombian Ministry of Culture invited him to create a series about the current situation of indigenous groups in their country, which resulted in the exhibit Look at us. Here we are in Bogot√° and other cities around Colombia. The same year he was invited by the Government of Finland and the S√°mi Parliament to carry out the project 520 Reindeer. A homage to S√†mi language, which depicts the richness and importance of the languages of the S√°mi, who are the last surviving indigenous people in Western Europe. This series has been exhibited in Venezuela and in Finland, and one of its main pieces was presented at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York during the Indigenous Peoples and Food Sovereignty exhibition. Now, the complete series belongs to the S√°mi people SIIDA Museum in Inari, Finland. In 2010, the institution Art Works for Change and the United Nations Environment Program invited him to carry out an artistic project on biodiversity in Rwanda, which he entitled Millions of pieces. One Puzzle. This series was presented during on the occasion of the World Environment Day celebrations of 2010, and it was exhibited at the Field Museum in Chicago. Two years later, in 2012, the artist presented The weepers. Our last tears (hired female mourners), a series consecrated to the repression of emotions, so characteristic of our contemporary culture, produced entirely in Northern Peru. That same year, he received the 2011 International Association of Art Critics Award for his outstanding career and commitment to the expression of a poetics of respect for the planet, its inhabitants and its cultures. Most recently, in 2014, Brice√±o presented the series Omert√† on oil. The era of silence, a video installation consisting on several video-portraits of victims of torture and other forms of disproportionate use of force by the military and paramilitary groups controlled by the government of Nicolas Maduro, during the civil protest and demonstrations that took place on February and March of that same year. Furthermore, his last series to this day, The skin of Mars, reflects precisely on the violence of war and the scars we bear as species and as individuals through the overlapping of images of planet Mars taken by NASA and pictures of as many sculptures of the homonymous god that rest in the collections of art museums around the world. Finally, in addition to his personal artistic endeavours, the artist has often collaborated with conservationist organizations: in 2007 he worked for Conservation International documenting the institution's cooperation programs for the Ye'kuana people in Venezuela, and in 2012 he photographed the Pum√© and Yopal communities, also in Venezuela, for The Nature Conservancy. Likewise, he has been invited to join the jury of the annual photography contest sponsored by PROVITA and the IUCN.

Life Deering was born in Saxony, educated at Hamburg and Leyden, and came to London in 1713 as secretary to Baron Schach, envoy to Queen Anne from Peter the Great. He remained in England as a tutor till November 1718, when he married and returned to the continent, where he took a degree at Reims, 13 December 1718. He went on to Paris, studying anatomy and botany under Bernard de Jussieu. In August 1719 he came back to England. For a time Deering worked as a medical practitioner in London. He joined the botanical society set up by Johann Jakob Dillenius and John Martyn, which existed from 1721 to 1726. In 1736, no longer married, Deering moved to Nottingham, with a letter of recommendation from Hans Sloane. At first Deering was successful in his practice, and issued a short tract on his method of treating the small-pox; but he may have been temperamentally unsuited to the work, He was made ensign in 29 October 1745, in the Nottingham infantry regiment, during the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. A sufferer from gout, in late life Deering succumbed to asthma, and declined. He died 12 April 1749, and was buried in St. Peter's churchyard, Nottingham, opposite the house he lived in. His name is commemorated by the genus Deeringia R.Br., still current in the family Amaranthaceae. Works Two years after moving to Nottingham, Deering published a list of local plants. With some of the cryptogams he had been helped by Dillenius. They collaborated in other ways, acknowledged by Dillenius in the preface to his major work Historia Muscorum. Materials collected by John Plumptre (died 1751) for a history of Nottingham were passed to Deering by friends. Edited by him for publication, they appeared posthumously as Nottinghamia Vetus et Nova (1751). It was printed by George Ayscough, and contained in particular a detailed description of the stocking frame.

Military medicine In 1909, a military manual from the Mounted Service School in Fort Riley recommended cannabis indica for treating abdominal pains in horses, or to supplement ether for treating spasms. During World War I, military doctors recommended that the American Expeditionary Force carry cannabis indica tablets to treat headaches, insomnia, and cramps. Drug use in Panama and investigations Some of the earliest reports of recreational cannabis use in the military came from the Panama Canal Zone in 1916, where troops were noted to be using the drug. Also in 1916, thousands of US troops used marijuana while in Mexico on General John Pershing's punitive expedition against Pancho Villa (1916‚Äì1917). In 1921, the commanding officer of Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, prohibited the use of cannabis on the base. A 1933 report by the U.S. Army Medical Corps published in the publication Military Surgeon, titled Marijuana Smoking in Panama, based on a study of U.S. Army personnel in the Panama Canal Zone, found that cannabis was generally not addictive and was less harmful to soldiers than alcohol.Ruth C. Stern & J. Herbie DiFonzo, The End of the Red Queen's Race: Medical Marijuana in the New Century, Quinnipiac Law Review, Vol. 27, p. 688.Marijuana Smoking in Panama, Military Surgeon, Vol. 73 (1933). The report recommended that use of cannabis on military bases should continue to be prohibited, but outside of these areas there should be no further restriction. Industrial hemp The Rens Hemp Company of Brandon, Wisconsin, closed in 1958, was the last legal hemp producer nationwide in operation following World War II. Prior to its 1957 shutdown, Rens had been the primary provider of hemp rope for the United States Navy. Edgewood Arsenal human experiments From the 1950s to the 1970s, Edgewood Arsenal conducted experiments on human subjects with cannabis and its derivatives. One study indicated \\"no loss of motivation or performance after two years of heavy (military sponsored) smoking of marihuana.\\" Vietnam War Though alcohol was the drug most commonly used by American troops in the Vietnam War, cannabis was the second-most common. Initially rates of usage among deployed soldiers were comparable to those of their stateside peers, with 29% of troops departing Vietnam in 1967 reporting having ever used marijuana in their lives. A 1976 study however showed that from 1967‚Äì1971, the proportion of troops having used marijuana peaked at 34% before stabilizing to 18%, while the number of troops who had used cannabis prior to deployment stayed around 8%. Cannabis use by troops in Vietnam was generally dealt with using Article 15 non-judicial punishment in units such as the 101st Airborne. During the Vietnam War period, cannabis use also became common among US forces in the United States and in Europe, with a 1971 article claiming that over 1,000 midshipmen at Annapolis Naval Academy used cannabis, and a survey in Germany showing that half of the soldiers in the surveyed battalion were regular cannabis users.

O'Neal's art has been exhibited widely throughout North America and internationally, with group and solo shows in Italy, France, Chile, Senegal and Nigeria. She lives and works in Oakland, California, and maintains a studio in Chile. Early life and education Mary Lovelace was born in Jackson, Mississippi, on February 10, 1942. She credits her father for nurturing her love of the arts. During her childhood and adolescence O'Neal's father, Ariel Lovelace, was choir director and professor of music at Tougaloo College and the University of Arkansas. O'Neal attended Howard University in Washington, DC, from 1960 to 1964 and studied with David Driskell, Lois Mailou Jones and James A. Porter, receiving her B.F.A. in 1964. She attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine during the summer of 1963. During her time at Howard University, O'Neal became active in the Civil Rights Movement and mentored by many influential leaders in the movement, including Stokely Carmichael, Jacob Lawrence and his wife, painter Gwendolyn Lawrence. She worked briefly at the Free Southern Theater (FST) with one of the theatre founders, her first husband John O'Neal. O'Neal continued her fine arts education at Columbia University, studying with Aja Junger, Stephen Greene, Leon Golden and Andra Rat. While at Columbia, O'Neal became involved in the Black Art Movement in New York City, which further influenced her work. She received her M.F.A. from Columbia University in 1969. Career Mary Lovelace O'Neal's paintings have progressed through different phases over her long career, beginning with loose forms and evolving to more precise patterns. O'Neal has received numerous awards and exhibited in many national and international exhibitions throughout her career. She was invited as resident artist to participate in the international arts festival in Asilah, Morocco, in 1983. O'Neal curated an exhibition for the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santiago, Chile, \\"17 Artistas Latino y Afro Americanos en USA\\" in 1991. Two years later, she received the Artist En France Award sponsored by the French government and Moet & Chandon. In 2005, she was selected to represent Mississippi in the Committees Exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. O'Neal started teaching full-time at University of California, Berkeley in 1978. In 1985 she became the first African American artist to receive tenure in the department of art, and then appointed in 1999 as the Chair of the Department of Art Practice until her retirement in 2006. She has taught at several institutions in the U.S. including the University of Texas at Austin, San Francisco Art Institute, California College of Arts and Crafts, Oakland, California. And she has taught internationally at Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Bogota, Colombia. In 1984, O'Neal worked on monotype printmaking with Robert Blackburn at the Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop in New York City. She enjoyed the process so much and she explored various other printing processes and printed over 200 prints at Blackburn's shop over the years. = Lampblack Series, 1960s-70s = O'Neal developed these paintings while earning her MFA at Columbia University. This series of monochromes, made in the late 1960s-early 70s, were monumental and made using ebony pigment that was rubbed into raw unstretched canvas using a chalkboard eraser or her hands. The deep black of the surface could, \\"absorb and silence the noise of ideology, activate space, and impact the body.\\" = Chasing Down the Image, Retrospective at Mnuchin Gallery, February 2020 = In February 2020, Mnuchin Gallery held O'Neil's first solo exhibition in New York since 1993, which surveyed over five decades of her work, from the late 1960s through 2000s. The mini retrospective, Chasing Down the Image, reveals the ways in which O'Neil has engaged abstraction and materiality exuberantly for political ends, marrying experimental black aesthetics with influences of Minimalism. She was engaged with issues taken up by Donald Judd, Joseph Stella, and Sam Gilliam while simultaneously having conversations with Amiri Baraka who pushed her to make images of the Black Power movement instead of abstraction. During the 60s and 70s O'Neal's abstraction went against the emphasis placed on figuration by the Black Arts Movement and the Black Panthers as a means for Black empowerment. O'Neal's work, \\"insists on the aesthetic integration of experiences and styles once construed to be mutually exclusive.\\" = Mary Lovelace O'Neal: Whales, A Romance... at the Museum of the African Diaspora, March 2020 = In March 2020, the Museum of the African Diaspora mounted a solo exhibition of O'Neal's Whales Fucking series from the 1970s. These expressionist abstract landscapes were made in response to her first visit to the Bay Area that decade. They are made using oil paint, glitter and tape. = Public Collections = Her work is in various permanent art collections including Oakland Museum of California, National Gallery of Art, Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian Institutions, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Oakland Museum of California, and the National Museum of Fine Arts, Santiago, Chile.  Personal life  Her first husband was John O'Neal. In 1983, O'Neal met the Chilean painter Patricio Moreno Toro, eventually she remarried.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet/priest Ezekiel, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. This chapter records a visit of some of the elders of Israel to Ezekiel, and God's response through the prophet dealing with the sins of idolatry. Text The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 23 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). The idolatrous elders (14:1‚Äì11) A group of elders approached Ezekiel (cf. Ezekiel 8:1 and 20:1) to 'enquire' of YHWH, which is a traditional practice of using the prophet as mediator to convey specific questions to YHWH (cf. ). YHWH told Ezekiel that he refuses to hear in the enquiry 'because of the seriousness of the elders' idolatry' (cf. 20:3‚Äì4) and 'the elders are not condemned simply for idolatry, but for 'lifting up' their idols 'into their hearts' (cf. the Jerusalem elders in 8:9‚Äì12, who maintained secret 'picture rooms' inside the temple itself). YHWH only responded by warning the elders 'to turn back from idolatry or suffer death at his hands' (verses 6‚Äì8), and if a prophet should deliver a response to the idolater's enquiry, YHWH would then destroy the prophet as well as the enquirer. =Verse 3= : Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, :: and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: : should I be enquired of at all by them? NKJV * \\"Son of man\\" (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ü÷æ◊ê◊ì◊ù -): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. * \\"Idols\\" (Hebrew: ◊í÷¥÷º◊ú÷º◊ï÷º◊ú÷¥ ; plural: ◊í÷¥÷º◊ú÷º◊ï÷º◊ú÷¥◊ô◊ù gillulim): found 39 times in the Book of Ezekiel and in . Originally means \\"trunks, logs, blocks,\\" that can be \\"rolled\\", it could denote \\"the primitive stone menhir or construct. * \\"Set up their idols in their heart\\": Rashi interprets this as \\"Their heart is toward their idols to worship [them].\\"Rashi's commentary on Ezekiel 14:3. *\\"The stumbling block of their iniquity\\": from Hebrew: , ,Hebrew Text Analysis: Ezekiel 14:3. Biblehub is a unique phrase of the prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel 7:19; 14:3, , ; ; ).Note [c] on Ezekiel 7:19 in NET Noah, Dan'el, and Job (14:12‚Äì23) In this section YHWH addresses the question of individual responsibility for sin, which was mentioned in chapter 9 when the righteous people in Jerusalem were 'marked so as to escape the city's destruction' (Ezekiel 9:4; cf. ), and whether a few righteous individuals might suffice to save an entire city (cf. Abraham in ) or at least members of their own family (cf. Abraham for Lot in Genesis 19:29). The number of citizens to be spared was apparently quite small, as Ezekiel protests that YHWH is destroying the last remnant of Israel (). YHWH posits that should the three 'legendary paragons of virtue': Noah, Dan'el, and Job, inhabit this land, even 'they would be helpless to save their own children from YHWH's punishment of famine, wild beasts, sword, and plague', which recalls the scenario in chapter 5 and 7 that YHWH is about to bring 'four levitically prescribed punishments against Jerusalem and Israel'. The conclusion of this chapter is clear: Jerusalem ('which is patently not inhabited by Noah, Dan'el, or Job') will not be spared, even 'for the sake of some few righteous citizens, or by the righteousness of those exiles whose children will now share in the city's doom' (). YHWH adds an ironic note that there will be survivors of the city's destruction who will be brought into exile to show the exiles of 'their obvious wickedness', so people will know that 'YHWH did not destroy the city without reason' (). =Verse 14= : Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, :: they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, : saith the Lord God. KJV * \\"Three men\\": These three men are selected as they had plead in different \\"worlds\\", according to Rashi, that is Noah witnesses the world destroyed and rebuilt, Daniel the temple destroyed and rebuilt, Job the prosperity/\\"greatness\\" destroyed and rebuilt.Rashi's Commentary on Ezekiel 14:14. These three Israel's righteous spiritual heroes \\"could not have prevailed with God in prayer to save the people\\" from the coming disasters. =Verse 20= : Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God, :: they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; : they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness. KJV * \\"They shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness\\": The city of Sodom could be saved with a minimum number of righteous people (), but the righteous people can only save one's own soul in the case of determined judgment on Jerusalem.

For certain elements such as phosphorus, the author documents his attempts to obtain samples by reproducing the original method of discovery. He also visits the site of discovery of several elements uncovered in modern times, including the famed Ytterby mine in Sweden, from which seven new elements were isolated. Reception The book received mixed but generally positive reviews from The Daily Telegraph, Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, and Science News. The Telegraph described the book as \\"a 400-page love letter to the chemical elements\\", and \\"an agreeable jumble of anecdote, reflection and information, rather than a source of understanding\\". Robert Buntrock, reviewing the book for the Journal of Chemical Education, found it to be more accurate and more enjoyable than The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean, a book with similar subject matter and audience published the year before.

She works are about Utopian ideas, the future, and alternative concepts for society. Her main instruments are drawing, interviews, the Internet, mechanics/electronics, and street art. She uses techniques from surveys to speculative fiction to explore \\"the collective production of culture, the interface of art and science, and the production and negotiation of public space\\". Her projects provide skeptical footnotes to global history. She modifies or mimics urban signs, advertisements, or services, jolting viewers out of their habitual ruts, upsetting conventional ways of seeing and of representing the world. Her interview-based drawing projects connect the streets and the Internet. Her aim is to create space for unusual thoughts and empowered communication: \\"The point is to rewrite existing structures as alterable, to change and rethink them (...) Through a collective work process (Wenzel) opens up new perspectives and visions of specific themes.\\" Wenzel often actively involves passersby in surveys or service interventions, testing machines of her own invention, or she interviews citizens as local specialists ‚Äì experimenting with forms of collective authorship and working against traditional notions of artists as \\"visionaries\\" who are supposed to possess special insights denied to the \\"average person\\". According to Wenzel, new ways of seeing, which are developing as part of the digital revolution, and of changing concepts of the urban realm are especially suitable for artistic infiltration to reflect the underlying structures of daily life. Life and works K√§the Wenzel: Bonebots, 2010In 2016, Wenzel became professor for Aesthetic Practice and Contexts at European University Flensburg. She studied in Marburg, Florence, and Berlin. In 2003 she received a PhD for her work \\"Meat as a Material in Art. Objects on the Interface of Art and Medicine\\" about oppositional artistic structures in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). She was an exchange scholar with the Fulbright Program at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2009‚Äì10. In a direct reaction to New York City she developed the Cartoonorama project, which combines drawing, interview, and cartography. Her art can be found in numerous museums and collections: the German Museum of Technology Berlin; the Sz√©nt Istv√°n Kir√°ly M√∫zeum, Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Hungary; the Koblenz Middlerhine Museum, and the Roemer- Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim.

Using Mughal miniature paintings with overlaid dialogue, Royal Existentials comments upon contemporary politics, social issues, and philosophy. Content Each strip of Aarthi Parthasarathy's Royal Existentials consists of a repeated classic Mughal miniature painting with dialogue overlaid, each panel having different dialogue. The webcomic updates weekly, and the dialogue presented in the webcomic comments on the social or political events of the time. Despite the repetitive panels, the webcomic maintains a clear rhythm by using well-placed pauses in its writing. Parthasarathy frequently comments upon the Jaipur, Kangra, and Deccan paintings she uses as well, noting the representation of women and their place in court in her dialogues. Development Parthasarathy founded The Royal Existentials in November 2014, after being inspired by David Malki's Wondermark, which injects Victorian art with humorous speech balloons. She came across Wondermark in 2010, and quickly thought that someone should do an Indian version of the same concept. The Royal Existentials is a product of Falana Dimka films, a company Parthasarathy co-founded with Chaitanya Krishnan. The lay-out of the webcomic and any additional art is provided by Krishnan, who said about the use of Mughal miniatures that their \\"opulent setting ... lends itself to talking about issues like inequality.\\" Parthasarathy found that the often anonymous subjects of these paintings lend themselves well for her scripts. Parthasarathy sits down to write a new strip every Thursday, so that she can publish it on the following day. The Royal Existentials doesn't explicitly cover whatever is in the news, but rather focuses on whatever is on its creator's mind, and can take on a philosophical perspective as well. Parthasarathy described her webcomic as a \\"diary of thoughts.\\" In an interview with The Bangalore Mirror, Parthasarathy stated that there's a \\"serious imbalance\\" in how feminists are represented in media, and that she \\"wanted to correct it with humour.\\" She noted that her goal is not to \\"manage her frustration with patriarchy\\" (a notion she finds \\"ridiculous\\"), but that she deliberately wants to change the world with humour, which she described as \\"a very powerful tool.\\" Reception Tarishi Verma of Hindustan Times stated that the webcomic uses its paintings \\"to brilliant effect\\". Parthasarathy herself stated that \\"the best part has been that there‚Äôs been a lot of discussion brought about the by Royal Existentials. People have come up to me and just had great, long conversations.\\" Bengalaru- based performing artist Avril Stormy Unger stated that The Royal Existentials allows people who are put off by more modern art styles the opportunity to understand feminism from a different perspective.

The briefcase bombing came two months after the Hafte Tir bombing, which killed over seventy senior Iranian officials, including Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti, then Iran's second-highest official. According to sources, nobody \\"knew exactly who had been in the room at the time of the detonation.\\" Eventually, there were three participants that had been unaccounted for that included Masoud Keshmiri, Rajai, and Bahonar. It was later revealed that both Rajai and Bahonar had died in the explosion. According to Albert Benliot, Ayatollah Khomeini charged the MEK with responsibility for the bombing, \\"however, there has been much speculation among academics and observers that these bombings may have actually been planned by senior IRP leaders, including later Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, to rid themselves of rivals within the IRP.\\" Afterwards, the interim presidential council announced five national days of mourning, and Iran's Parliament selected Ayatollah Mahdavi Kani as the next prime minister. Bombing Front page of Ettela'at newspaper, reporting the blast. The Iranian Prime Minister's office after the 1981 explosion. According to the survivors, the bomb exploded when one of the victims opened a briefcase brought by Masoud Keshmiri as an \\"agent of MEK\\". Ettela'at reported that the explosion destroyed the first floor and partially damaged the second floor of the Prime Minister's building, located on Pastor Street. Rajai, Bahonar, and military and security officials were killed. The injured were rescued from the rubble and transported to the hospital. Due to their severe burns, the corpses were not easily identified, and some of the victims were identified through their teeth. =Prominent officials killed= * President Mohammad Ali Rajai * Prime Minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar * Col.

Katiba'ee, representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Suspects Although no group claimed responsibility for the bombing, it was nevertheless attributed to the MEK. Ann K. Reed notes that Western observers believe the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) was \\"most likely to have been responsible for the bomb blasts of June 28 and August 30.\\" However, Van England notes that \\"the explosions were set off by insiders - the first by an accomplice working in the offices of the IRP, the second by the guard in charge of security at Prime Minister Bahonar's headquarters.\\" Mangol Bayat also expressed doubts that the MEK would be capable the attacks \\"since infiltration of the regime at the very high level would have been necessary.\\" The Islamic Republic of Iran later claimed that the attack was carried out by MEK agent Masoud Keshmiri, secretary of Bahonar's office and of the Supreme National Security Council, who used a fake passport to escape Iran after the attack. More than twenty suspects were identified in the subsequent investigation, including Masoud Keshmiri, Ali Akbar Tehrani, Mohammad Kazem Peiro Razawi, Khosro Ghanbari Tehrani, Javad Ghadiri, Mohsen Sazgara, Taghi Mohammadi, and Habibollah Dadashi. =Perpetrator= The Islamic Republic of Iran identified Masoud Keshmiri (who had served as Bahonar's office secretary for a year prior to the bombing) as the perpetrator. An official in the Prosecutor General's office said that Keshmiri had concealed his anti-government activities so well that a corpse mistaken for his was buried on 31 August with full honors as a martyr of the Islamic revolution. Abdol Hossein Daftarian was stuck in the elevator after the explosion, where he suffocated to death. The MEK bought some time for Keshmiri by spreading the rumor that the man found in the elevator was actually him. Although the Iranian authorities arrested and executed numerous MEK agents, Keshmiri fled the country using a fake passport. Aftermath Following the deaths of Rajai and Bahonar, an interim presidential council was formed, as stipulated by Article 130 of the Iranian Constitution. The interim council consisted of Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, then Parliament's speaker, and Ayatollah Mousavi Ardabili, then president of the Supreme Court. The council announced five national days of mourning and nominated Interior Minister Ayatollah Mahdavi Kani to Parliament as the next prime minister. Parliament held an election on 2 October 1981 to elect Bahonar's successor; Kani won a parliamentary vote of confidence to become prime minister, receiving 178 votes in favor, 10 votes against, and 8 abstentions (out of 196 total votes).

It has a humble beginning as a prayer group started in 1917 as Asamankesse but later got affiliation with Apostolic Church Bradford. History Peter Anim Newman began a healing ministry in 1917 under the name Faith Tabernacle as a result of healing received from acute stomach upset and guinea worms infections after he had read a magazine published by Faith Tabernacle USA called \\"Sword of Spirit\\". In 1931, Anim through a fellow Faith Tabernacle minister in Nigeria David O. Odubanjo contacted missionaries of the Apostolic Church of Bradford, to pay his team a visit. Rev George Perfect a missionary sent by Apostolic Church Bradford to Nigeria, passed by Asamankesse in Ghana and stay with the Faith Tabernacle church for two weeks. An agreement was met between George Perfect and Peter Anim. Also Peter Anim and his members fully embraced the doctrine and practices of the Apostolic Church Bradford. Hence, Anim's church became The Apostolic Church Gold Coast. A year later,a major \\"Holy Ghost Outpouring' was experienced. Healing, miracles and salvation was greatly recorded and therefore impacted the growth of the ministry numerically. They requested for an external missionary from Bradford, which was granted in 1937, James McKeown, was sent as the first Pentecostal missionary from UK to Asamankese. The church by then practices strictly divine healing. James McKeown had suffered from malaria and subsequently hospitalized in the European Hospital in Ghana. He responded to treatment successfully. However, he faced hostility from the Church which felt betrayed by their missionary had receive medical treatment against the teachings of the church. This disagreement led the church into division.

The fortresses were positioned at Semna because of the expansion of Egypt into Lower Nubia by Senusret III, and were a means of protecting and controlling access into Egypt. The Semna Despaches record the movements of people around the Semna Gorge, and reports their activity's back to an unnamed official in Thebes. Many of the Despatches deal with people who had come to the forts to trade with the Egyptians while others talk about patrols that had gone out and found people in the surrounding desert. The Semna Despatches provides the bulk of information that pertains to the administrative functions of the forts around the Semna Gorge. The Semna Despatches form one of very few records that tell us about what the forts around the Semna Gorge did, and what life was like in the forts. These Despatches are therefore very important to us historically, and give us a glimpse into the forts. The Despatches also provide a look at the Egyptians attitudes towards the people of Nubia to the south as they record the interactions between Egyptians and Nubians. These Despatches are now housed in the British Museum. The Semna Despatches are now part of the British Museums collection; after being gifted by Alan Gardiner who had acquired them around 1900 in return for his financial help with preservation and publishing the papyri. The collection is cataloged as AE10752.1, AE10752.2, AE1075.3, AE10752.4, AE10752.5, AE10771.1, AE10771.2, AE10772.2. Unfortunately, two of the Despatches suffered significant damage from the use of cellulose nitrate film with both of the papyri being seriously damaged  Semna Forts  During the reign of Senusret I the Egyptians started to push further south into lower Nubia and by the reign of Senusret III it became necessary to build forts around Semna Gorge; this area would provide a defensive position in case of attack by Nubia, who were still a powerful enemy. The forts also served a second purpose which was to control access into Egypt. The people whom they were trying to keep out were Nubians as you can clearly see in the boundary stela of Senusret III which speaks of the Nubians as a wretched vile people. To accomplish the task of keeping the Nubians out the Egyptians would send patrols into the desert to find people who may be trying to cross the border clandestinely and report those movements to the other forts as well as to officials in Thebes which is the main reason the Semna Despatches were created. Nubian's Egyptian attitudes towards Nubians was based more on stereotypes and religious feeling then actual facts. The Egyptians saw the outside world as one being of disorder which must be controlled to preserve Maat (or order) with this extending to outside country's particularly Nubia. Because the Egyptians saw Nubia as disordered its people were considered disordered and therefore it was good to destroy and control them as we see in the Boundary Stela of Senusret III. We can see in the Semna Despatches the Egyptians upholding Maat by keeping the Nubians out.  Discovery  The Semna Despatches were found in a Theban tomb which was below the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses II by J.E.Quibell in 1895-1896. The Despatches were found in a wooden box in a very poor state of decomposition with estimates that around two thirds of the Papyri having been already lost when Quibell found them. The Despatches suffered another mishap as when they were being hoisted out of the tomb they fell from the basket back down the shaft potentially damaging more of the already fragile papyri. After Quibell got them back to England they sat on a shelf in the Edwards Library at University College, London until they were given to the esteemed Egyptologist Alan Gardiner to preserve and publish around 1900  Translation  The Job of translating the Semna Despatches fell to Paul C. Smithers who worked on them in early 1940 until his death in 1943. Unfortunately, because it was war time, and because Smithers died in September 1943 from a lingering illness he was unable to consult the original plates containing the Semna Despatches so instead he worked from photographs. Because of the difficulty in working from photographs Smithers encountered some errors in translation that was fixed by Dr Bryan Kraemer and Dr Kate Liszka in 2016 Kraemer and Liszka also made a translation of two separate papyri found with the Semna Despatches which also related to the Semna Forts. Unlike the Semna Despatches which dealt with monitoring the movements of people around the Semna Gorge these papyri dealt with administration and talk about the inspection of officials in the fort of Elephantine. = Semna Despatches Despatch 1. = = Paul C.

[...]  Conservation  Given the poor state of preservation the Semna Despatches were in when they were discovered it was inevitable that they would need to be preserved. Alan Gardiner funded the preservation with Hugo Ibscher doing the actual preservation work which was begun in 1903 and lasted until around 1939. Ibscher used several different methods for preserving the papyri which included attaching them to Celluloid Nitrate film, gelatin film, and cardboard then sandwiching them between glass. Unfortunately, the use of celluloid nitrate film can be very unstable and in the case of two of the papyri burning has been caused because of its use. Fortunately, only the two damaged papyri were found to contain celluloid nitrate film with the rest being gelatin film that is far more stable. The way the preserved papyri were mounted has caused damage however. Because the papyri were mounted in-between two sheets of glass when the frame is moved the papyrus moves slightly causing damage. To stop further damage the British museum started in 2006 to remove the frames and the gelatin film then remount the papyrus to fine tissue paper to ensure their continued preservation. This recent preservation could only be carried out on some of the papyri however as the adhesive used on the others, Celluloid nitrate adhesive, is very difficult to remove and because of the papyrus‚Äô already fragile state the British museum decided to not try and remount those.

The topic of the canvas is taken from the Book of Judges, verses 4:11-22 and 5:24-31. It depicts the moment in which Jael is about to kill Sisera, a defeated Canaanite general. After his defeat he flees to a nearby settlement. There Jael takes him in, promises to feed him, and hide him from the authorities. The moment he is asleep she drives a tent peg through his temple. This subject is seldom depicted in seventeenth century art, there very few other examples contemporary to this painting. The date, 1620 can be seen at the bottom of the Artist's prominent signature, carved in to the pillar.

While living and working in Florence, Artemisia adopts this surname, which belonged to one of her uncles, rather than the Roman Gentileschi, to strengthen her ties the city among her potential patrons.

The prominence of the artist's signature indicate that this was a work she felt worthy of praise. The three-line signature reads, \\"ARETEMITA LOMI/FACIBAT/MDCXX.\\" This is the first example of Artemisia using the imperfect tense of the Latin verb Facibat, perhaps a reference to the way in which Michelangelo signed his Pieta.

It has a patchy distribution on the Pacific coast of Central and South America, occurs in places on the Atlantic coast of that continent, and has a more widespread range on the Atlantic coast of West Africa. Description Members of the genus Rhizophora are very similar to each other in morphology. They grow up to tall often with aerial stilt roots, but in more marginal habitats are shorter, more branched and scrubby. The leaves grow in opposite pairs, each pair with two interlocking stipules. The leaves are simple and entire, with elliptical hairless blades and slightly down-rolled margins. The lower surfaces have numerous tiny corky warts which appear as black spots on dried leaves. At one time considered to be a subspecies of Rhizophora mangle, R. racemosa is now accepted as a full species, most easily distinguished by the fact that the stem of the axillary flowers branches up to six times, making a maximum cluster size of 128. However, the inflorescences more usually contain 32 to 64 flowers. Other distinguishing characteristics include thick, short rounded bracteoles and rounded flower buds. Ecology Ripe propagule Flowers In West Africa, estuaries, bays and lagoons are fringed by tidal mangrove forests, dominated by Rhizophora and Avicennia. When new mudflats are formed, seagrasses are the first plants that grow on the mud, with Rhizophora racemosa, a pioneering species, being the first mangrove to appear. With time, the mud solidifies and more tree and plant species arrive. On the seaward side the trees are short but get steadily taller further inland. The nipa palm (Nypa fruticans) has been introduced to Nigeria and Cameroon and has become invasive, to the detriment of the native mangrove species. Some insect pollination takes place, but R. racemosa is largely wind- pollinated. The fruit produce propagules which may fall into the water and be dispersed by wind and currents. Uses In West Africa, Rhizophora racemosa is used for construction poles and firewood on a limited scale. The smoke has antimicrobial properties and is also used for smoking meat. In the Americas it is less likely to be harvested as it is more scarce and is not considered to be of much value.

Some of these collaborated with the Nazi regime.  ReGeDe  Before 1927, there was hundreds of deaf clubs all over Germany. Each club had its own agenda and differed by city and deaf community. In 1927 Weimar Germany, a transformation was beginning. It was to be a transformation that would change the deaf community in Germany permanently. = Beginning = The Reichsgewerkschaft der Geh√∂rlosen Deutschlands, abbreviated and stylized as ReGeDe, was known in English as The Reich Union of the Deaf of Germany, and was founded in 1927 in Weimar, Germany was a social organization. By the Easter of 1933, ReGeDe was fused into the National Socialists' public welfare program. Less than a year later, ReGeDe boasted more than 3,900 members, including deaf activist Karl Wacker who fought on behalf of the deaf community against the sterilization law. The ReGeDe union included such groups as deaf advocacy and support agencies, self-help organizations, sports clubs, and much more. \\"the division of deaf associations into church-affiliated groups, and athletic union, and others\\". was too much to Siepmann. He saw \\"just one association for the German deaf‚Ä¶a union\\" The union he envisioned was the ReGeDe. Following Siepmann's example, further efforts were made to incorporate the remaining independent organizations into ReGeDe. ReGeDe had a strong desire to crush local deaf organizations, and all of the associations that now formed ReGeDe enticed, threatened, and coerced deaf children to become members, and appeals were even made to their parents. Werner Thomas made such a plea to involve deaf children in Hitler Youth, found in the Newsletter of the Berlin Deaf Athletic Association: > \\"Of the Leipzig and Dresden Sports Associations almost one hundred percent > of the members are doing their duty with joyful hearts as Hitler Youth. It > is then all the more shameful that many Berlin athletes still oppose > membership...training in Hitler Youth and the troopers is very worthwhile > for the German people as a whole. There out youngsters will be trained in > iron discipline, comradeship and self-sacrifice...We, as deaf, will never be > called to the labor force, to the army and so on. Service in Hitler Youth > offers you the last opportunity to go through a hard school...serving the > interests of Adolf Hitler's Reich takes precedence over everything!!!...I > urge you for the last time...to report to the troop leader...otherwise, > dissociate yourselves with our fine community...Finally I appeal to the > respected parents and also to my fellow club members to give their full > understanding to the action that I have undertaken in the state's interest\\" REGEDE's recruitment methods were successful, as it grew from 3,900 on Easter in 1933, to 11,588 members by January 1, 1937. Fear of the sterilization law most likely amplified these member numbers as some deaf believed that becoming a member of ReGeDe would allow them to be protected from the sterilization law. However, the leaders never promised protection from the law, it was only assumed by the German deaf. As the Nazis gained more power, ReGeDe moved to become a more thorough Nazi organization. \\"Contributing greatly to this powerlessness [of the deaf peoples] was the unification and harmonization policy of the ReGeDe, whose Nazi leadership clique fully endorsed the ideology of Nazi eugenicists and race hygienists.\\" In 1927, shortly after ReGeDe's founding, Fritz Albreghs (1892‚Äì1945) became its chairman. ReGeDe was led by the Deaf Nazi Fritz Albreghs, the 'Fuhrer of the Deaf'. He used both sign and speech to get across the Nazi message. Albreghs organized ReGeDe by Nazi leadership standards, and supervised it strictly. All local deaf clubs and associations were taken over by district associations, and those, in turn, were under the district inspectorates. = The Downfall = Siepmann, head of the German deaf athletic club, the Deaf Union for Physical Training also supported consolidation under Nazi leadership. \\"The organization's head, Fritz Albreghs, had applied for Party membership for everyone in ReGeDe.\\" Albreghs and the administrative head Ballier, both of whom signed the ReGeDe membership card, did not hesitate to denounce their \\"hereditarily diseased\\" fellows. Albreghs even wore a brown stormtrooper uniform and swastika-eventually most leaders of REGEDE did as well. In 1942 Albreghs was removed from the leadership of ReGeDe, and Karl Brunner took leadership. However, the following year leadership was taken by Karl Engelmann who lead the Deaf Hitler Youth. The actions of the German Deaf Workers Union founded in 1918 and which joined the ReGeDe were said to \\"instead of building up [the deaf community] had destroyed everything in a fratricidal war!\\" Albreghs, Siepmann and Edmund Matz worked together to pursue a policy of unifying all organization for and of deaf Germans with the premise: \\"where resistance arises, it will gradually be eliminated\\" and \\"when necessary, harshly and ruthlessly\\" ReGeDe worked with teachers and administrators in encouraging support for the Nazi regime and its racial hygiene program. One regional association in 1937 reported that \\"collaboration with Nazi public welfare is excellent. Almost the entire body of teachers of the deaf are working effectively in our common sense of destiny.\\" Part of this \\"destiny\\" involved sterilization of deaf and other 'hereditarily diseased.' ReGeDe was a \\"strong proponent of sterilization\\", even going as far as releasing a statement that: \\"prevention is better than cure,\\" and that it is patriotic to be sterilized since \\"the deaf do not need to be soldiers but sterilization is a sacrifice like soldiering.\\" People felt threatened by the sterilization law and joined ReGeDe in hopes of avoiding being sterilized. It was said that \\"whoever refused was taken away by police.\\" Teachers, principals, nurses, and ReGeDe leaders turned in deaf people, and sometimes even personally took them to the clinics. One deaf person who experienced these events recounted: \\"despite the fact that I was a party member, I was sterilized after a 12-month long judicial process.\\" Horst Biesold, the author of Crying Hands conducted a survey and found that 5 of the 1,215 forcibly sterilized deaf respondents reported that the ReGeDe had informed on them, with Albreghs and Ballier reporting 2 of those 5. = Deaf women in Nazi society, and ReGeDe's role = Emilie Klusener-Esch founded the women's division of association of the deaf in 1911, but it was not active. Emilie was involved in the development of introducing deaf women to Nazi ideology. She joined the Nazi women's organization in 1932, and shortly thereafter, Albreghs gave her authority to establish the Reich women's union within the ReGeDe. Emilie was voluntarily sterilized even though she came from a \\"hereditarily sound\\" family. She touted that being sterilized is a sacrifice. and used that sacrifice as a model to convince other deaf women to also be voluntarily sterilized.  Deaf Union for Physical Training  The athletic club was founded by Heinrich Siepmann, a leader of the Deaf who proposed the consolidation of the separate Reich Union with the athletics division under the Nazi regime. Athletics was seen as a means by which children could be conditioned, not only physically, but socially in favor of representing Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party as a whole. It was felt that children should engage in athletic activity at least once a week. The tactics by which recruitment efforts were made included, among others, enticement, threats, and coercion.  Friends of the Deaf  Friends of the Deaf, also known as Jedide Ilmim, was a Jewish support organization for deaf people founded by Markus Reich and would be continued by his son, Felix Reich. The \\"Friends of the Deaf\\" was established in an effort to help fund the school Markus Reich had founded, the Israelite Institute for the Deaf of Germany. The efforts made by this group would aid in amassing support from the community for the Deaf cause.

Riverton was located directly on the Mississippi River, and flourished during the 1870s and 1880s. The location is today occupied by a shipping port and industrial park. North of the former settlement is Great River Road State Park. History Riverton was located along a bend in the Mississippi River called \\"Rosedale Bend\\", and nearby Rosedale was located at the top of the bend. The location was originally known as \\"Wood Yard\\" and \\"Old Pride's Point\\", and was a place where steamboats would stop during the 1840s to load fuel-wood harvested from the dense forests near the river. Riverton was one of many Mississippi settlements established on the Mississippi River opposite the mouths of the White River and Arkansas River in Arkansas. B. J. Martin built the first railroad in Bolivar County from Riverton to Bogue Phalia, approximately east. The railcars were pulled by mules. Charles T. Christmas, a former slave from Riverton, patented a bailing press in 1880 which made cotton bales more compact, and therefore cut shipping costs. In 1884, D. Reinach built one of the largest stores in the Bolivar County at Riverton, and served as postmaster of the Riverton post office. A post office operated under the name Riverton from 1873 to 1896.

Though significantly smaller than the well- known Rio Carnival or the Portuguese Carnival of Madeira, the Goa Carnival is the largest in India and one of the few traditional celebrations of the Catholic holiday in Asia. Despite falling into obscurity during the latter days of the Portuguese colonial rule of Goa, the Goa Carnival was resurrected as a minor street celebration in 1965 and has since turned into a major tourist attraction for the small state.  Origin  While the roots of the Carnival in Goa date back to the introduction of Roman Catholic traditions during the Portuguese conquest of Goa, the festival itself fell into obscurity during the later days of colonialism, as Portugal's authoritarian regime known and is celebrated on the same day as Portugal Estado Novo limited freedom of assembly and press. After the end of Portuguese rule, the festival was resurrected by Timoteo Fernandes in 1965, a Goan musician who modeled it after the famed Rio Carnival. Today, the urban parade includes floats from local villages, commercial entities, and cultural groups. It is still organised in a very traditional manner, including by the staging of streetside local plays, in the coastal taluka of Salcete. According to the Government of Goa's Department of Tourism, the carnival is \\"Goa's most famous festival and has been celebrated since the 18th century.\\" The Carnival usually starts off on Fat Saturday (known as Sabado Gordo) and concludes on Fat Tuesday (known as 'Shrove Tuesday'), just before Ash Wednesday and the first day of the Catholic season of Lent. In Panjim, the capital of Goa, the festival is complemented by \\"Grape Escapade\\", a local Wine festival, and a dance at Samba Square in the centrally-located Garden of Garcia da Orta. According to local tradition, during Carnival Goa is taken over by King Momo, usually a local resident who presides over the festival during the 4-day span. King Momo traditionally proclaims the Konkani message ‚ÄúKha, piye aani majja kar‚Äù (English: ‚ÄúEat, drink and make merry‚Äù).  Parade  The parade usually begins on Fat Saturday evening with a procession headed by King Momo. Balloons, horse-drawn carriages, decorated bullock carts and elaborate floats are the highlights of the parade. The festivities during Goa Carnival include dancing troupes, revelers wearing masks and costumes, live music, sports competitions, floats & parades, and food and drinking. = Dates = In 2018, the festival was celebrated from 9‚Äì12 February. In the urban areas, individual float parades were held in the Goan cities and towns of Panjim, Margao, Ponda, Vasco, Curchorem, Mapusa and Morjim.

Design The P 214 would have been carried as a parasite aircraft by a mother plane to an altitude above the enemy bomber fleet. Then the pilot would have put the aircraft into a steep dive in order to deliver a strong explosive charge. Once the aircraft was well-aimed at the target the pilot should have bailed out, letting the unmanned plane explode in the middle of the enemy bombers. However, even though it was theoretically feasible for the pilot to escape, in practice the chances were next to nil. Although it was not intended as such, owing to the real dangers for the pilot inherent in the operation of this dangerous aircraft, the P 214 is sometimes listed as a suicide weapon.

Either international identifier GBA (Alderney) or GBG (Guernsey) may be displayed on the vehicle, and this is seen either in the oval format required internationally by the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, or on the side of the registration plate, in a similar style to that used in the EEA under EU Regulation 2411/98. The latest numbers issued (in late Summer 2017) are in the low 3000's (e.g. \`AY 3017\`). Alderney is identified as a jurisdiction in its own right in the 1926 Convention on Motor Traffic. Before the Second World War registration were issued at the Island Hall by the Island's Government, the States of Alderney; following the 1948 Agreement driver and vehicle licensing was delegated by the States of Alderney to the Guernsey Government as one of the \\"transferred services\\"; thus motor vehicle registrations are now issued by the Guernsey Government upon application to the General Office of the States of Alderney at the Island Hall in Alderney. Registration certificates (known informally as 'log books', as in the UK) are issued by Guernsey on the States of Guernsey's Environment Department logo, but with the issuing authority stated as the States of Alderney. Because of this, the international designator for Guernsey may be displayed on the car instead of GBA, if preferred by the car's owner (this is relatively rare, however). There are no legal requirements as to how an Alderney plate is to be made up ‚Äì the Alderney Road Traffic Ordinance appears to be silent on this. Alderney plates are commonly seen as either white or silver on a black background (pre-1973 UK style), or black on the white or yellow (both pre-2001 and post-2001 UK typeface styles). One or two vehicles are to be seen with old French-style white/yellow plates,n German or American-style plates. Occasionally number plates may even be hand-drawn, or the number painted on the car.  Notable plates  \`AY 1\` is privately owned, as are all single digit registrations (although one is owned by the electricity company, a States' majority-owned company). \`AY 999\` is used for the main police car (usually a 4-wheel drive vehicle, currently a Dacia Duster). \`AY 1071\` is the registration of QUAY-FM's outside broadcast van. (QUAY-FM broadcasts on 107.1 FM) Several vehicle registrations correspond to the four-digit telephone number of their respective owners (i.e. +44 1481 82 xxxx) ‚Äì for example, the Georgian House Hotel's courtesy vehicle bears the mark \`AY 2471\`. = Sark and Herm = Sark and Herm ban motor vehicles other than tractors from their roads.

It is one of the densely populated Awo-Omamma rural settlements in the Njaba River basin. Location Umuezukwe is located strategically on the bank of Njaba River in the southern end, facing Ngbelle, Abiaziem, Awa, Ndegwu and Izombe, just across the river. Politically, Umuezukwe is in Eziawo Ward II of Awo-Omamma in Oru East.It is bordered by Isieke Community to the East, Umuezike to the West, Otulu in Oru West to the North-East, and Onitsha-Owerri Expressway to the extreme North, which cuts through Awo-Omamma Junction. Oil Palm Trade Like some other Awo-Omamma villages on the banks of Njaba River, Umuezukwe was known for its oil palm trade during the era of international oil palm business. The then government of Eastern Region operated an Oil mill factory near Njaba River waterfront in Umuezukwe. In addition to the government managed Umuezukwe Oil mill, private businesses moved in, established and operated their commercial mills within the community and its neighbours. Due to the lucrative oil palm trade and the commercial waterway in the region, the community's Eke Market held on the river beach, becoming a converging point for local and international traders, thus supporting the larger market of neighbouring Oguta. The market was renamed 'Eke Beach Umuezukwe'. The economic activities around the entire area turned Umuezukwe into one of the renowned river ports in the basin, and an economic hub for exports and evacuation of goods to and from the Eastern coast via Orashi River-Oguta Lake-Njaba River routes. Early Christian Mission Umuezukwe is a peace-loving accommodaing and friendly village. It was among the early communities in the Njaba/Orashi River region, and the first in Awo-Omamma to embrace Christianity. This was possible because of its location on Njaba River-Oguta Lake-Orashi River navigable waterways and trade route. =Parish= The Irish Christian missionaries founded St Anthony's Catholic Church, Umuezukwe, in the 1890s. On 28 March 2013, the Roman Catholic Church confirmed Umuezukwe as a parish at the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Orlu. =Education= In 1897, the foundation blocks for St Anthony's Primary School, Umuezukwe, was laid. The school was eventually completed in 1908. Following government take over of the management of the School from the church, it was renamed Umuezukwe Primary School, a public institution. Analysis of survey conducted on 16 April 2014 for combined Pre-primary and Primary Schools showed the school was understaffed and in need of modern and adequate classrooms to support effective teaching and learning. Specifically, the survey found that the school had 345 learners served by 5 teachers and 9 classrooms. That is, 185 male students and 160 female students. Tourism Umuezukwe has a number of tourism potentials capable of lifting its economy and that of the entire river basin. In addition to its Ughamiri (local name for Njaba River) waterfront, oil-palm forest, Umuezukwe is known in the region for its sacred monkeys which exist and move freely in their natural habitat within the 'Afo' sacred forest, and in the community. The ancient economic nerve, Umuezukwe, and the entire Awo-Omamma people are also rich in cultural festivals, masks, and dance. Sections of Awo-Omamma closer the river are in lowlands. Umuezukwe, other Awo-Omamma and Oguta LGA communities across the river such as Ubahaeze, Umuezike, Umuelibe, Ngbelle, Abiaziem, Ndegwu and Awa, have hilly areas and valleys with forests just before the waterfronts on both sides. In addition, the relics of the historic Umuezukwe Oil mill on the beach, the historic and asphalt-needed 'Umuezukwe Road' washing unto Njaba River, and the relics of St Anthony's Primary school building, are other attractive sites in the community. The historic network of roads in Umuezukwe aided the lucrative trade and farming relationships with neighbours and other riverine communities in Oguta LGA, Ohaji/Egbema, and Rivers State through Njaba River-Oguta Lake-Orashi River navigable waterways to the Eastern coast. There is also the Palm Beach Villa, an old holiday resort, founded by Dr BU Nzeribe, on the southwest of the community along the waterfront. Cash Crops In addition to its known cassava, yam and fish produce, Umuezukwe produced and earned income from cashew nuts from the community's cashew plantain in the hilly lowland valled region known as Aba-Umuezukwe. Economic challenges Poor and undeveloped road conditions coupled with unreliable electricity supply are some of the serious infrastructure and environmental challenges working against the restoration of the economic potentials of Umuezukwe, the entire Awo-Omamma and rural farming border communities in Oguta LGA. =Rural Access Road= The river basin's rural communities have huge economic potentials, including arable land and fishing ports for farming, that require basic infrastructure, more importantly interconnecting roads and bridge across Njaba River to link up \\"Umuezukwe Road\\" to their neighbours in Oguta LGA, in order to unlock the economic potentials and improve the lives of residents and businesses in Oru East and Oguta LGA communities. The trade and historic route to and from Orlu communities connecting Omuma, Amiri, passing through Umuezukwe over Njaba River, Oguta to the Eastern coast and other Niger Delta communities, needs to be developed, bridged and asphalted to improve economic activities - movement of goods and people in the region.

One of the 4-IPO metabolites is toxic to the lungs, liver and kidney in humans and animals. This metabolite can covalently bind to proteins, thereby interfering with normal cell processes. The toxic metabolite, an enedial, is mostly formed in the bronchiolar exocrine cells (club cells) in the lungs of rodents. Necrosis of bronchiolar cells is therefore the primary damaging effect of the toxin, due to this location of metabolism. The secondary pathological effects are edema, congestion and hemorrhage caused by the destruction of the bronchiolar exocrine cells. In humans the metabolite is mostly formed in the liver, and causes liver toxicity.  Structure and reactivity  4-Ipomeanol is a chemical compound belonging to the family of furans. It consists of a furan ring, which is substituted at the third carbon of the furan ring with a pentanone containing a hydroxyl group. A furan ring is a five-membered aromatic ring consisting of one oxygen atom and four carbon atoms; a pentanone is a ketone consisting of five carbon atoms. Other 3-substituted furans are ipomeanine (IPN), 1-ipomeanol (1-IPO) and 1,4-ipomeanol (DIOL), differing in the locations of the hydroxyl groups. 4-IPO has three functional groups which determine the molecule's reactivity. These are the furan ring, the ketone group and the alcohol group. = Reactivity of furan ring = The furan ring is aromatic according to H√ºckel‚Äôs rule, so the furan makes the compound relatively stable. Therefore, this ring will not react easily with other compounds. Furan is heterocyclic, which means that it is cyclic, but one or more of the ring atoms is not a carbon atom. In the case of furan this heteroatom is an oxygen atom. This atom is sp2 hybridized and has one lone pair in an sp2 orbital and a second lone pair in a p orbital, overlapping with the p orbitals of adjacent carbons. This results in a pi bond formation. = Reactivity of ketone = A ketone group is polar, as oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. Therefore, the carbonyl atom of the ketone group is electron deficient, thus electrophilic, and can easily react with nucleophiles. However, it does not undergo substitution reactions, as the attached molecule is a too strong base to be eliminated. As a result of this, irreversible nucleophilic addition reactions are possible: a nucleophile can add to the carbonyl carbon, but due to the lack of a good leaving group, no base is eliminated. This intermediate molecule takes up a proton, so a hydroxyl group is formed. When there is sufficient acid present, the hydroxyl group can be protonated further, making it a good leaving group. This functional group will then react as an alcohol group. As described above is the basic reaction mechanism of ketones. In this way ketones can undergo several organic reactions, reacting with compounds like grignard reagents, acetylide, cyanide, and hydride ions, amines, water, alcohols and peroxyacids. = Reactivity of alcohol = The alcohol group is a strongly basic leaving group that cannot undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions. However, it becomes a better leaving group after protonation, which converts the leaving group from OH‚àí to H2O. H2O is a weaker base than OH‚àí and can thus undergo substitution reactions with weakly basic nucleophiles. This reaction occurs following a SN2 mechanism, as 4-IPO is a secondary alcohol. Dehydration of the at the pentanone substituted alcohol group is also possible, following an E1 reaction mechanism. This reaction is acid-catalyzed and results in the loss of a water molecule. Like with the SN1 reaction, protonation of the leaving group is required first. Water then is eliminated, leaving behind a carbocation, which leads eventually to alkene formation. Furthermore, secondary alcohols can undergo oxidation reactions. This results in the formation of a ketone.  Synthesis  left 4-IPO can be isolated from sweet potatoes infected with the fungus Fusarium solani. However, it can also be synthesized from the commercially available chemical diethyl 3,4-furandicarboxylate. Partial hydrolysis of diethyl 3,4-furandicarboxylate (I) with an equimolar quantity of NaOH results in the monoester 4-(ethoxycarbonyl)furan-3-carboxylic acid (II) occurs. This is followed by decarboxylation by heating with a copper powder yielded ethyl 3-furoate (III). The Claisen condensation is used to form ethyl 3-furoylacetate (IV). By reacting with propylene oxide, lactone (V) is formed. Decarboxylation is achieved by gently heating lactone in the presence of diluted acid (VI).  Metabolism  Metabolic activation of 4-IPO occurs by one of the enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily. The oxidation of the furan ring leads to the formation of an unstable epoxide (cyclic ester with a three-atom ring), so an alkylating intermediate species, 4-IPO enedial, is formed. In rodents it is CYP4B1 that activates 4-IPO [1], an enzyme of the CYP4 family, of which the CYP4B subfamily is involved in the fatty acid metabolism. CYP4B1 is present in high levels in the lungs and its affinity for 4-IPO is greater than for liver CYP enzymes. Therefore, the activated form of 4-IPO is mainly toxic to the lungs in rodents. Schematic illustrating bioactivation versus inactivation routes for 4-IPO after either P450- or uridine 5‚Ä≤-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase-mediated metabolism However, in humans the reactivity of CYP4B1 is different and it does not activate 4-IPO. The CYP enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are active in the liver and are similar to the rodent CYP4B1. 4-IPO is thus metabolically activated by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in humans. These two enzymes are both part of several pathways involved in the drug metabolism. As both CYPs are mainly active in the liver, 4-IPO causes hepatotoxicity in humans. In both rodents and humans phase I metabolism involves the biotransformation of 4-IPO into an epoxide intermediate by CYPs. This epoxide is unstable, so it degrades into an enedial intermediate. The enedial intermediate is toxic, as it can bind to proteins. However, it can be detoxified in phase II metabolism, in which the enedial can be conjugated with either N-acetyl lysine (NAL) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). This results in a NAL/NAC-IPO adduct, which can be excreted. Furthermore, 4-IPO can directly undergo phase II metabolism, by conjugating glucuronosyl to the hydroxyl group of 4-IPO by uridine 5‚Äô-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), forming 4-IPO glucuronide. This can, like the NAL/NAC-IPO adduct, be excreted. However, the major pathway involves the enedial intermediate and the NAL/NAC-IPO adduct is the major product of biotransformation. In contrast with these findings of in vivo studies, several other pathways for biotransformation of 4-IPO are found in vitro. In vitro microsomal incubation of 4-IPO and its GSH adducts as products Next to oxidation of the furan ring of 4-IPO, so that the 4-IPO enedial is formed, the hydroxyl group of 4-IPO can be oxidized. Oxidation of this functional group leads to ketone formation, so IPN is formed. IPN can undergo oxidation of the furan ring by CYPs, like 4-IPO. After this bioactivation reaction, the product can be conjugated to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Furthermore, 4-IPO can be reduced and DIOL is the product of this biotransformation. Finally, 4-IPO can interact with NADP+, forming a molecule which contains 4-IPO and NADPH. Of these four pathways described, the oxidation to IPN and the reduction to DIOL are the major processes. Next to the difference in possible metabolic reactions 4-IPO can undergo, there is also a difference in the metabolization of the reactive 4-IPO enedial. This compound can be metabolized by either UGT or GSH. Metabolization by UGT results in NAL/NAC-IPO adducts, while multiple products can be the result of GSH metabolism. Interaction of the 4-IPO enedial with GSH leads both to a Michael adduct and a dihydrohydroxyfuran adduct. The Michael adduct is the product of a Michael addition (1,4-addition of a cysteine), of the cysteine in GSH at the 4-position of the enedial. This Michael adduct can undergo dehydration and forms, via a tricyclic 2‚Äô-pyrroline adduct (14), a mono-GSH pyrrole adduct (16). Another reaction the Michael adduct can undergo is again dehydration and conjugation with GSH. Via the formation of subsequently an imine, enamine and an iminium ion, a bis-GSH pyrrole adduct (18) is formed. Another reaction via which the Michael adduct can form a bis- GSH pyrrole adduct (20), is firstly by undergoing elimination of a ketone group, followed by again dehydration in combination with GSH conjugation. The dihydrohydroxyfuran adduct can also undergo dehydration in combination with GSH conjugation in a similar way as the Michael adduct, which results in a bis-GSH pyrrole adduct (19). Furthermore, the dihydrohydroxyfuran can dehydrate and form a mono-GSH pyrrole adduct (17).  Pharmacological use  Distribution of 4-IPO across tissues shows the same patterns for intravenous, oral and intraperitoneal injection and peak concentrations are achieved one to two hours after administration. By then most of the 4-IPO will be located in the lungs, followed by liver, kidney and blood. Apart from having the highest 4-IPO concentration, lung cells also show the highest level of covalently bound 4-IPO. This is in contrast with the gut, where the most occurring form of 4-IPO is unbound. After four hours 4-IPO levels show a plateau which persists for 24 hours. 4-IPO molecules still present at that time are mostly bound to other macromolecules. The IC50 was determined by an automated cell culture growth inhibition assay which shows IC50 ranging from 2-8 mM, depending on the cell type. The IC50 was also determined by another group which found roughly the same. Detoxification is suspected to occur primarily via glucuronidation of 4-IPO. Out of all the metabolites found in urine, the primary excretion pathway, 4-IPO glucuronide was the most abundant. Excretion of 4-IPO glucuronide can be increased when rats were treated with phenobarbital, which increases Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. Half-life varies from species to species. In mice the half-life is approximately 33 minutes after intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg 4-IPO. This is lower in rats and dogs. Rats need around six minutes to reduce the 4-IPO concentration by half and dogs around ten minutes. Both were administered a single intravenous dose of 6 mg/kg. = Preclinical trials = Several in vitro experiments were performed to explore the possible uses of 4-IPO, which showed promising results. Different lung, ovarian, breast and melanoma cancer cell lines showed apoptosis or inhibited tumor growth when exposed to high levels of 4-IPO (100 ug/uL). These results could not be replicated in conventional cancer screens, probably due to the fact that 4-IPO metabolism relies on very specific enzymes and environments which could not be replicated by conventional screens. However, 4-IPO showed effects when exposed to human lung cell lines. Four cell lines were tested and two showed inhibited tumor growth. Both cell lines were non-small cell lung carcinoma, while the two cell lines with no effects were small cell tumors. Other experiments showed that 4-IPO reduced tumor growth in a microencapsulated tumor assay at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Furthermore, covalent binding of 4-IPO intermediates was observed in fresh lung biopsies. = Phase I Trial= On the basis of this knowledge a phase I trial was performed to study the effects of 4-IPO on the human body. 34 men and 10 women with non-small cell lung cancer were tested. The trial showed no significant hematological or renal toxicity but also no effect on the tumor. Measurements with biopsies obtained from the patients showed an IC50 of 6 mM, which is around 75 times higher than the measured plasma concentrations and likely higher than the plasma concentration achievable in vivo. = Phase II Trial= An earlier phase I and pharmacological trial showed that hepatotoxicity is dose limiting in humans and not lung toxicity. Based on these results a phase II trial was conducted to test the effects of 4-IPO on patients with advanced measurable hepatocellular carcinoma. Nineteen patients were treated with 1032 mg/m2 4-IPO. One patient showed a brief reduction in metastasis in the lung, but the rest showed no significant effects. As a consequence the authors recommend that 4-IPO is not used for further testing. = Further use in cancer treatment = Recently 4-IPO has been used in experiments where it plays a role in T-cell therapy. Autologous T-cells can be altered to express tumor specific antigens. These cells will then bind to tumors and induce apoptosis. There are side-effects associated with this kind of treatment and 4-IPO can help to control those side effects. A suicide gene is needed to induce apoptosis in T-cells when needed. CYP4B1 is inactive in humans but with minor changes in the amino acid sequence it can be activated again. This would result in T-cell death when the cells are exposed to 4-IPO, because they metabolize 4-IPO efficiently. Non toxic 4-IPO analogues are also capable of inhibiting nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK) metabolism. NNK is a pre- carcinogen which is activated inside the lung. Out of the four analogues tested (4-hydroxy-lphenyl-1-pentanone (HPP); 7-hydroxy-1-phenyl-1-octanone (HPO); 4-hydroxy-1- (2-thienyl)-1-pentanone (HTP); 4-hydroxy-l-(3-pyridyl)-l-pentanone (HPYP)) HPP and HPO showed competitive and noncompetitive inhibition of NNK and it reduces tumor formation in mice.  Toxicity  4-IPO is a specific lethal toxicant which mainly targets bronchiolar exocrine cells in the smaller bronchioles of rodent and cattle lungs. With an increased dosis it is also possible to affect other cells and the airway of organisms. Covalent binding of 4-IPO to members of the CYP family (mainly CYP4B1) eventually leads to biotransformation of 4-IPO into an enedial intermediate, which is able to bind to a variety of proteins. These binding events are permanent and responsible for 4-IPO toxicity. This will result in cytotoxicity and eventually necrosis of bronchiolar exocrine cells, while ciliated bronchiolar cells and other epithelial lung cells are not affected, due to lower levels of cytochrome proteins. Necrotic patches, also called lesions or primary pathological changes, can develop into edemas, resulting in thickening of the alveolar septum, congestion, and hemorrhage (secondary and tertiary pathological changes). Lethality is probably due to pulmonary edema. Prior to death the dogs also showed rapid and shallow respiration, while in rats labored respiration and lymphocyte depletion can be observed. The LD50 dose varies between different species. In female mice 21 mg/kg/day 4-IPO are sufficient while in male mice 35 mg/kg/day were necessary. 15 mg/kg 4-IPO intravenously administered into rats is lethal and in dogs this dose is 12 mg/kg. It is possible to increase the LD50 by 2‚Äì4.5 fold when individuals are treated with multiple non-toxic doses beforehand. In humans, 4-IPO shows minimal effects in the lung because the enzymes needed for biotransformation of 4-IPO are not present. Instead the liver is affected, because human liver cells do contain enzymes to biotransform 4-IPO. Something similar can be observed in male mice. Apart from the effects seen in the lungs they also have certain enzymes in their kidney which can transform 4-IPO into its reactive intermediate. As a result, renal toxicity is observed. Female mice and immature male mice do not have these enzymes. Therefore, they are resistant to renal toxicity.  Effects on animals  4-IPO has, similar to humans, a toxic effect on animals. It is toxic to livestock and many laboratory animals. Male rabbits, mice, rats and hamsters were used to test the effect of 4-IPO on. In all four species, the lung was a major target. In the hamsters and mice additional liver necrosis and renal necrosis, respectively, was detected. 4-IPO can also threaten newborn calves. If they become exposed to 4-IPO it increases their susceptibility to bovine parainfluenza virus 3. Parainfluenza itself does not have severe health effects but together with other infections it can lead to complex enzootic pneumonia.

As a journalist in Berlin, Hirsch was involved in the infamous libel case of Kurt Soelling. Biography =Early life= Hirsch studied history at the University of Heidelberg where he graduated under German historian and political journalist, Hermann Oncken in 1924.Hirsch,1946 After university, Hirsch moved to Berlin to pursue a career in journalism at the Berliner Tagelblatt and later became the editor at the Achtuhr Abendblatt. Following the rise of Nazism, Hirsch went into exile in America, and completed a librarian degree at Columbia University in 1936. He subsequently moved to Bard College, where he would teach history and expand the library. =Kurt Soelling Controversy= On the 18th May 1932, Judge Kurt Soelling (born Seligsohn), the Chairman of the Berlin District Court, brought a libel action against Hirsch for an article he wrote in the Achtuhr Abendblatt that revealed Soelling's Jewish identity. Soelling was born into a Jewish family, but baptised a protestant in later life. He had been a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany but in 1931, declared himself a Monarchist and became a prominent supporter of the burgeoning Nazi party and Adolf Hitler. Hirsch's article not only revealed the judge's Jewish identity, but alleged that he had converted to Protestantism to further his judicial career. Hirsch denounced Soelling as a \\"dishonest politician\\". The case concluded on the 19th May 1932, with Soelling admitting that he was of Jewish descent, but that he had converted out of conviction. He explained his activities within the Nazi Party as an attempt to understand the organisation, and justified his use of the Nazi salute by the fact that everyone else at the rallies he attended had used it. Hirsch lost the libel case, and was ordered to pay damages of 500 Reichsmark. According to a dispatch issued by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency regarding the intriguing proceedings: > There was something of a sensation in court when it came out in the course > of the proceedings that Judge Soelling is the son of the lay head of the > Romberg Jewish Community, and that he had held over his baptism until after > the death of a rich uncle who was a strictly observant Jew, so that he > should not be cut out of his will, and that he had been baptised only after > he had received the legacy. Justice Soelling was eventually disbarred and forbidden to practice law in Germany as a result of the Nazis' anti-Semitic reforms of 1933. =Marriage and children= He married long-term friend, academic Elisabeth Feist in 1938, and they had two children together. Towards the end of his life, he suffered from Parkinson's disease. He died in 1982, at a retirement home in Newtown, Pennsylvania.  Notes  References * Mosse, W. E. (1965).

Built in 1982 by Burrard Yarrows Corporation in Vancouver, British Columbia, she was part of the fleet of Canadian icebreakers, drillships and support vessels operated by Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of Dome Petroleum and later Amoco Canada Petroleum Company. In 1997, the vessel was sold to China Oilfield Services and renamed Bin Hai 293. She was used to support offshore oil production in the Bohai Sea until 2016 when the 34-year-old icebreaker was sold for scrapping.  History  = Development and construction = In the mid-1970s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, began drilling for oil in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea using ice-strengthened drillships and an extensive support fleet of icebreaking vessels. Aiming for year-round operations, the company also began developing its own experimental icebreaker concepts to support exploration drilling and, eventually, production-related operations. The first vessel of this research and development program was the 1979-built Canmar Kigoriak which represented a radical departure from conventional icebreaker designs with, among other features, a single-shaft mechanical propulsion system instead of a more commonly-used diesel-electric powertrain. Following the successful demonstration of Kigoriaks icebreaking capability in the Beaufort Sea, it was agreed to continue the program with the construction of a second vessel. In addition to testing new design features such as an improved hull form and twin-shaft propulsion system, the new icebreaker would be a 4:1 scale model of a proposed Arctic tanker intended for transporting oil year-round from the Canadian Arctic to the market. The construction of new icebreaking supply vessel was awarded to Burrard Yarrows Co. in Vancouver, British Columbia, in June 1979. The keel was laid on 8 October 1981, only about one month after the construction had begun, and the hull was launched on 26 May 1982. The icebreaker was delivered to Canmar on 24 September 1982. Canmar's new icebreaker was named after Robert LeMeur (1920‚Äì1985), a French-born priest- missionary who arrived to Tuktoyaktuk in 1946. He was awarded the Membership of the Order of Canada in 1982 for his efforts to preserve and promote the Inuit culture.Robert LeMeur, C.M., o.m.i.. The Governor General of Canada. = Robert LeMeur (1982‚Äì1997) = Robert LeMeur was designed to support seasonal exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea. Her typical annual operational profile would begin in May with a warm-up that would gradually bring the vessel systems online after five months of cold lay-up. After commencing break-out, the Canmar icebreakers would first carry out one or more resupply missions to the drilling islands where exploratory activities have continued through the winter. In June, the icebreakers would return to the winter base to escort the drillships to predetermined drilling locations. Once the spread-mooring system had been deployed and drilling commenced, the icebreakers would remain on site to carry out ice management by breaking up large floes that could threaten the drilling operation. Once all ice had melted, Robert LeMeur would continue with supply missions to different Beaufort Sea drilling operations. In the autumn, the Canmar icebreakers would return to continue ice management around the drillships until ice would become too thick for the mooring systems. By the end of November, the drillships would be escorted back for winter lay-up and Robert LeMeur would carry out final supply runs to the drilling islands. Although the vessel would typically be laid up for winter in mid-December, she was capable of continuing supply operations through the winter. In some years, Robert LeMeur was involved in research and development projects during the winter months or drydocked on Canmar's floating dock for inspection and repairs. In 1982‚Äì1989, the Canmar drillships drilled only 10 wells for Dome Petroleum and other oil companies in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In addition, four more wells were drilled by the drillships in the Alaskan waters in 1985‚Äì1991. Other wells were drilled from artificial drilling islands as well as novel drilling systems such as Kulluk and the single steel drilling caisson.Beufort Sea Exploration Wells. BOEM. While a number of oil and gas discoveries were made, none of the findings were sufficient to warrant commercial production. Following the falling oil prices in the 1980s and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, hydrocarbon exploration in the Beaufort Sea and the MacKenzie Delta gradually ended.Oil and Gas Exploration & Development Activity Forecast, Canadian Beaufort Sea 2013-2028. Lin Callow, LTLC Consulting, March 2013. Robert LeMeur was reportedly laid up in 1996.

She became part of a large fleet of vessels distinguished only by number and was used to support Chinese offshore platforms in the seasonally frozen Bohai Sea.

At the time, the vessel originally built for the Canadian Arctic had spent more than half of her 34-year-long career in the Bohai Sea under the Chinese flag. The decision to scrap the old icebreaker was likely related to the large fleet renewal program, which included ice- strengthened tonnage, carried out by China Oilfield Services.Shipbreaking Bulletin of information and analysis on ship demolition #46, from October 1 to December 31, 2016.

In addition, since it was decided not to dredge the Tuktoyaktuk harbour to a greater depth, Robert LeMeur was also designed to carry as cargo as possible at a lower draught of . The displacement of the vessel at design waterline was 5,853 tonnes, corresponding to a deadweight of 2,690 tonnes.Robert LeMeur: A Supply Ship for the Arctic. Motor Ship, 63, 1983, p. 36. Robert LeMeur had a spoon- shaped icebreaking bow designed to minimize ice resistance, a further development of Canmar Kigoriaks hull form. The bow was also fitted with reamers that made it about wider than the vertical-sided midbody, breaking a wider channel that would help with turning in difficult ice conditions. The deckhouse was mounted forward of a open cargo deck and nine bulk cargo silos. The superstructure design was chosen to minimize vibrations and maximize visibility from the one-man primary conning position. She had accommodation for 14 crew members and 12 supernumeraries. Under the main deck, Robert LeMeur had a full-length double hull as per Canmar policy. = Power and propulsion = Robert LeMeur had a diesel-mechanical propulsion system with two diesel engines driving controllable pitch propellers in nozzles. The main engines were supercharged 12-cylinder MaK 12M453 medium-speed diesel engines rated at each. The engines were fitted with oversized flywheels to increase the inertia of the propulsion system against ice impact. The shaftlines were placed so close to each other that the nozzles in the stern were actually joined together. Onboard electricity was generated by four Caterpillar D399 auxiliary generating sets. For maneuvering, Robert Lemeur had twin rudders with a maximum turning angle of 45 degrees and two transverse bow thrusters. For icebreaking operations, Robert LeMeur had an extensive outfit of various \\"ice management systems\\" designed to reduce friction between ice and the hull of the vessel. A powerful hull wash system could be used to wet the snow on ice ahead of the vessel by spraying water through eighteen openings on the hull, reducing the ice resistance by 20 to 30 percent based on ice trials in various ice conditions. A secondary system could be used to pump water below the waterline between hull and ice floes. Two air bubbler systems were fitted: one in the bow to lubricate the hull and another in the stern to prevent ice from entering the nozzles. The hull was coated with an abrasion-resistant low- friction epoxy paint. Finally, a heeling system capable of rocking the vessel back and forth could be used to prevent the vessel from getting stuck and assist in turning. In ice, Robert LeMeur could achieve a speed of . The maximum icebreaking capability was predicted to be about . In open water, the vessel could reach a speed of . The bollard pull of the icebreaker was 103 tons.

History Cox was born in London, \\"within the sound of Bow Bells\\", a son of a hat-maker with an established business in the city. He was educated at St Saviour's School, a classmate of Sydney Waterlow. Cox served an apprenticeship, but left the trade to train as a schoolteacher at the Normal College, Borough Road, run by the British and Foreign Bible Society. The principal, Henry Dunn (1800‚Äì1878), author of Principles of Teaching, or The Normal School Handbook 1837, offered him a position with the projected branch of the school in Cairo, but the scheme changed with the Egyptian boys being brought to London instead, and Cox was put in charge of a school in Gloucester. While there, he served as lay preacher at the village of Longney. His next post was to a school in Croydon, then was trained as a missionary at the Congregational Home Mission College, near Bedford. He was then sent to serve as pastor at the Congregational Church at Market Weighton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and after four years received the call to Adelaide, which he accepted, perhaps influenced by his sister Martha Cox (1826 ‚Äì 25 June 1919), who married Charles Cleeve Collison (1820 ‚Äì 7 November 1884) and was mother of Charles Nicholas Collison and emigrated to South Australia in 1849 or 1850. :The Congregational (or \\"Independent\\") Church in Adelaide, founded by T. Q. Stow, from November 1840 had a chapel in Freeman Street (later part of Gawler Place). In 1851 a breakaway group led by William Peacock and I. J. Barclay founded their \\"Ebenezer Chapel\\" opened in June 1851 on land donated by Peacock near the old East Terrace Market. Cox arrived in South Australia with his widowed mother Sarah Cox (c. 1891 ‚Äì 3 December 1865) aboard Victoria in November 1857 and preached his first sermon at the Ebenezer Place (named for the chapel and not vice versa) chapel. Soon the little church (\\"obscurely situated in a dirty lane off Rundle street\\" ‚Äî Rev. W. Harcus) was full to overflowing, and a larger premises was clearly called for. :A public meeting was held at White's Assembly Rooms, with William Peacock presiding over a gathering of 1,000 people. Vigorous addresses were delivered by the Hons. J. H. Barrow, Alexander Hay and Thomas Reynolds and Revs. William Butters, William Harcus, and Silas Mead of the Flinders Street Baptist Church, and as a result plans for a new building were soon under way. :The cornerstone of the new Hindmarsh Square Church was laid by William Peacock on 21 August 1861 and new building, built to seat 450 and with its schoolroom and vestries completed a year later. Rev. Cox preached his first sermon in the new church on Sunday 7 September, assisted by Charles Manthorpe, and C. W. Evan, and was uninterruptedly associated with this church until 1897. He had a most harmonious relationship with his \\"flock\\", and resisted invitations, possibly more lucrative, to leave for Melbourne. He has been described as a tireless worker for the sick, the aged and the dispossessed, notably the Aboriginal population. He was closely connected with the London Missionary Society, the South Australian Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society and Union College. Cox was twice Chairman of the Congregational Union, and occupied the post of secretary for 17 years. He was secretary of the Fraternal Association of Congregational Ministers and chairman of the Aborigines' Friends' Association. He was, with George Taplin, largely instrumental in establishing the Point Mcleay Mission. Cox was an authority on art and frequently called upon to act as judge at art exhibitions conducted by schools and amateur art groups, but reluctantly had to relinquish this pleasant duty when faced with failing eyesight. He resigned his pastorate on 21 November 1897 and died eight years later, and was succeeded by Rev. S. Lenton, who served the Hindmarsh Square Church from 1898 to 1904.

He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. =Nature= Tsjalling Halbertsma was, according to his brother Justus, an imitator of great skill, a trait he had inherited from their father. Justus also wrote about him, \\"There was no greater lover of silliness and jokes in all of Friesland than my brother Tsjalling; but, mark this, always in the wasted hours. When it was time for business, all of the joking stopped, and then activity, policy, hard work and calculations were the order of the day from early in the morning to late in the evening.\\" One of his biographers (J. P. Wiersma) described Tsjalling Halbertsma as \\"a talented, conspicuous person, full of drollery, not without vanity, but original in thought and word, distinctive in all his doings, a trendsetter.\\"Wiersma, p. 13. A different biographer (G. A. Wumkes) wrote about him: \\"Here the pen is wielded by a man of high character.\\"Wumkes, p. 485. =Trade= When Hidde Halbertsma died, in January 1809, and was followed in death by his wife Ruerdtsje Binnerts in December of that same year, the Brothers Halbertsma became orphans at a young age. Justus, the eldest brother, was in Amsterdam at that time, studying to become a minister, while Eeltsje, the youngest, was boarding in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden, where he attended the Latin school. In consequence, it fell to Tsjalling to keep their father's bakery running with the help of their father's baker's mates, until the third brother, Binnert, was old enough to take over the business. After that, Tsjalling Halbertsma started to work for one of his uncles in Grou, who was a merchant trading in butter and cheese. At that time farmer's wives churned and made cheese at the farmstead, selling their products to merchants who traded it away, not seldom to foreign markets.Twerda, p. 296. In time, Halbertsma took over his uncle's company, which he expanded steadily over the course of many years.Terpstra, p. 320. At first he worked on commission for the Amsterdam trading house of Pijnakker, but later on, he went into business for himself, buying up dairy products in Friesland and selling them with considerable profit in London. Halbertsma became a wealthy man, who, with his brother Binnert (who had sold the bakery and had become a wood merchant) and only ten others, such as Freerk Dirks Fontein of Harlingen, Michiel Hylkes Tromp of Woudsend, Hans Klazes Wouda of Sneek and Dirk Piers Zeper of Leeuwarden was a member of the new Frisian Chamber of Commerce. Furthermore, from 1850 to his death, he had a seat in the provincial assembly of Friesland. In 1837, Halbertsma had himself a large new house built in Grou, something his brothers were rather boastful of in their letters. He also dressed himself according to the latest fashion, leading to Eeltsje complaining, in 1841, that his brother had become a dandy. But in the end Halbertsma miscalculated badly: when the shares in other businesses he had invested in dropped sharply in value in 1848, he panicked, sold out, and put all his money in rye. When subsequently the rye market also collapsed, he suffered heavy losses amounting to about half of his fortune. This was a severe blow, especially to his ego, which he never truly recovered from. =Family= In 1813, Halbertsma married Tetsje Sjollema (1793‚Äì1836). She was from Grou, and he had known her for all of his life. A year after she died, he remarried, to Reinskje van der Goot (1807‚Äì1862), who was also from Grou. When this second marriage was contracted, he ordered fifty flags to be hung out in the village, and he gave away a fat cow to the poor. One of Halbertsma's sons from his first marriage, Johannes Tsjallings Halbertsma (1827‚Äì1884), took over the dairy trade after his father's death, and moved it to the city of Sneek.Schroor, p. 1125. There Halbertsma's grandsons Hylke (1857‚Äì1932) and Herrius (1864‚Äì1920) established the dairy Normandia in 1888. =Authorship= Tsjalling Halbertsma began his career as a writer in 1817, on occasion of his brother Binnert's wedding. Afterwards, he wrote fairly regularly until 1835, with a clear peak around 1830, later followed by incidental writings until 1841. The last eleven years of his live he did not produce any new works. He ofted used the pseudonyms 'Master Jouke' and T.T., which was an abbreviation of 'Tsjalling Tsysker' (\\"Tsjalling Cheese-maker\\").Dykstra en Oldenhof, p. 42. Halbertsma's literary works were always overshadowed to a large degree by those of his brothers Justus and Eeltsje; they consist of folk literature, often with a satirical or playful motif, which, however, was very popular with the common man. His Sets en Tsjerk yn Snitser Merk (\\"Sets and Tsjerk at the Fair yn Sneek\\") was almost a match for the more famous poem De Boalserter Merk (\\"The Bolsward Fair\\"), by his brother Eeltsje. Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma. Tsjalling Halbertsma's oeuvre was fairly limited,Terpstra, o. 320. and consisted for a large part of rhymes written for the occasion of Shrove Tuesday and New Year, weigh-house notes, accompanying texts for prints, and fortune-telling notes,Terpstra, p. 321. partly in West Frisian, but to a considerable degree, especially in the early years, in Dutch. Furthermore, it is known that, even before his brothers Justus and Eeltsje published their De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar in 1822, Tsjalling Halbertsma also wrote small tales and poems for a society in Grou. It is unclear what sort of society this was, but it seems very likely it was a remnant of a so-called 'people's society' from the French period, such as were established all over Friesland from 1795 on. Halbertsma published a number of his works in almanacs, although this was limited, insofar as it can still be determined, to the period from 1829 to 1833. The first of his works he had printed in an almanac must have been Sets en Tsjerk yn Snitser Merk, which appeared in Suringar's Almanak for the year 1829. Gerard Tjaard Nicolaas Suringar himself would assert years later that De B√™ste Freed yn Ljou'ter Merke (\\"The Best Friday of the Fair in Leeuwarden\\") was the first piece by Halbertsma which he had published, but he must have been mistaken, as it can be clearly shown from Justus Hiddes Halbertsma's letters that De B√™ste Freed appeared in Suringar's Almanak of 1830. Completely apart from the rest of Halbertsma's works is De Roeker (modern spelling: De R√ªker; \\"The Bouquet\\") a magazine which was edited by himself, and which included articles concerning topical subjects, but also some of his own tales and poems. Of this publication only a few volumes were published in 1832 and 1833. =Death= Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma died on December 12, 1852, in his birthplace of Grou, when he was almost 61 years old. When he was still alive, he had been the steadfast centre of the Halbertsmas of Grou, where his brothers Binnert and Eeltsje especially were often visiting and always welcome. According to his brother Justus, the family became \\"a scattered herd\\" after his death,Wiersma, p. 12. and Eeltsje wrote to Justus: \\"I feel like a soldier who has seen his best comrade sink down next to him on the field of battle.\\" Legacy After the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.Breuker 1993, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\").Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Terpstra, p. 313. Apart from a few of his poems and his part in De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas (\\"Boss Joute's Barbershop\\"), Tsjalling Halbertsma works, however, remained outside of that collection. It was not until the fourth reprint of Rimen en Teltsjes, which was published in 1918 by publisher and bookshop owner Rinse van der Velde from Leeuwarden, that the composition of the work was thoroughly adjusted. At that time Tsjalling's contribution took a more visible form through the absorption of De Wiersizzerij fan Maaike Jakkeles (\\"The Fortune-telling of Maaike Jakkeles\\") and a number of shorter texts and poems. Today, Rimen en Teltsjes is seen as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì596. it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As of today Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.

Home energy storage devices store electricity locally, for later consumption. Electrochemical energy storage products, also known as \\"Battery Energy Storage System\\" (or \\"BESS\\" for short), at their heart are rechargeable batteries, typically based on lithium-ion or lead-acid controlled by computer with intelligent software to handle charging and dischargning cycles. Companies are also developing smaller flow battery technology for home use. As a local energy storage technologies for home use, they are smaller relatives of battery-based grid energy storage and support the concept of distributed generation. When paired with on-site generation, they can virtually eliminate blackouts in an off-the-grid lifestyle. Operating modes =On-site generation= The stored energy commonly originates from on-site solar photovoltaic panels, generated during daylight hours, and the stored electricity consumed after sundown, when domestic energy demand peaks in homes unoccupied during the day. Small wind turbine are less common but still available for home use as a complement or alternative to solar panels. Electric vehicles (EVs) used during weekdays, needing recharging overnight, are a good fit with home energy storage in homes with solar panels and low daylight-hour electrical consumption. EV manufacturers BMW, BYD, Nissan and Tesla market own-brand home energy storage devices to their customers. By 2019, such devices had not followed the price reduction of automotive batteries. The units can also be programmed to exploit a differential tariff, that provide lower priced energy during hours of low demand - seven hours from 12:30am in the case of Britain‚Äôs Economy 7 tariff - for consumption when prices are higher. Smart tariffs, stemming from the increasing prevalence of smart meters, will increasingly be paired with home energy storage devices to exploit low off-peak prices, and avoid higher-priced energy at times of peak demand. Advantages =Overcoming grid losses= Transmission of electrical power from power stations to population centres is inherently inefficient, due to transmission losses in electrical grids, particularly within power-hungry dense conurbations where power stations are harder to site. By allowing a greater proportion of on-site generated electricity to be consumed on-site, rather than exported to the energy grid, home energy storage devices can reduce the inefficiencies of grid transport. =Energy grid support= Home energy storage devices, when connected to a server via the internet, can theoretically be ordered to provide very short- term services to the energy grid:- * Reduced peak hour demand stress - provision of short-term demand response during periods of peak demand reducing the need to inefficiently standing up of short generation assets like diesel generators. * Frequency correction - the provision of ultra short-term corrections, to keep mains frequency within the tolerances required by regulators (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz +/- n%). =Reduced reliance on fossil fuels= Due to the above efficiencies, and their ability to boost the amount of solar energy consumed on-site, the devices reduce the amount of power generated using fossil fuels, namely natural gas, coal, oil and diesel. Disadvantages =Environmental impact of batteries= Lithium-ion batteries, a popular choice due to their relatively high charge cycle and lack of memory effect, are difficult to recycle. Lead-acid batteries are relatively easier to recycle and, due to the high resale value of the lead, 99% of those sold in the US get recycled. They have much shorter useful lives than a lithium-ion battery of a similar capacity, due to having a lower charge cycle, narrowing the environmental-impact gap. In addition, lead is a toxic heavy metal and the sulfuric acid in the electrolyte has a high environmental impact. Second life for EV batteries To offset the environmental impact of batteries, some manufacturers extend the useful life of used batteries taken from electric vehicles at the point where the cells won't sufficiently hold charge. Though considered end of life for electric vehicles, the batteries will function satisfactorily in home energy storage devices. Manufacturers supporting this include Nissan, BMW and Powervault. Salt water batteries Home Energy Storage devices can be paired with salt water batteries, which have a lower environmental impact due to their lack of toxic heavy metal and ease of recyclability. Unfortunately, Saltwater batteries are no longer being produced on a commercial level after the bankruptcy of Aquion Energy. Alternatives or complement Pico Hydro Using a pumped-storage system of cisterns for energy storage and small generators, pico hydro generation may also be effective for \\"closed loop\\" home energy generation systems. A storage heater or heat bank (Australia) is an electrical heater which stores thermal energy during the evening, or at night when electricity is available at lower cost, and releases the heat during the day as required. Accumulators, like a Hot water storage tank, are another type of storage heater but specifically store hot water for later use.

History  The station opened on 28 August 1841 by the Blyth, Seghill and Percy Main Railway. The station was situated on the A190 Station Road, on the south side of the level crossing. The Seghill Colliery was situated to the north, on the second of the third line that branched off the passenger line. The primary goods traffic handled at the station was bricks, clay and ganister; this was ceased on 9 December 1963. The station was closed to passengers on 27 June 1964 and closed completely on 7 June 1965. Reopening proposals There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway system since the 1990s; Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to . In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle, Ashington and possibly a new terminus to the east, at , was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The study suggested that due to the short distance between the former stations at Seghill and only one, rather than both, of them should be reopened. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. Despite this, the county council has continued to develop the project, announcing a further ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019. It is envisaged that passenger trains could be introduced as early as 2022. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. Under these plans, the reopening of Seghill station appears to have been dropped in favour of reopening Seaton Delaval station, though even that option has been excluded from the initial ¬£90 million phase and is instead proposed as part of Phase 2 of the project.

The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. The political party Venstre has been based in the building since 1971. History Carlsminde originates in an old tenant farm. Courty physician and kancellir√•d Johan Peter Homuth constructed a small country house at the land in 1751 and later expanded the estate with more land twice. The current building was built for a later owner, Peter Wasserfalls, a grocer and manufacturer, probably a few years prior to his death in 1782. Wasserfall left the estate to his son who also purchased another nearby property. Carlsminde then changed hands many times. One of the later owners was prime minister Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow who wanted a summer residence close to Copenhagen. The property was given the Carlsminde by Bolette Rudolphine Berg (1761-1836) in memory of her late husband Carl Berg. She also completed a 3.5 hectare park in English landscape style. Carlsminde was owned by hunting master Rasmus Petersen from 1855 to 1867. During this period Carlsminde changed status from tenant farm to ownership. A later owner, Valet de chambre G. F. Bentzen, changed the facade in 1894. Carlsminde was acquired by Isak Gl√ºckstadt in 1903. He expanded the estate from 10 to 25 hectares. The park was expanded by the landscape architect Erstad J√∏rgensen . It was centred on lake with pikes and tenches and was also home to two Indian elephants. In 1907 Gl√ºckstadt commissioned Carl Brummer to built a Norwegian-style cabin. It was moved to Rungsted in 1910 and to Holte in the early 1940s. Dethlef J√ºrgensen owned Carlsminde from 1913 to 1947. He sold off most of the land, creating the streets Carlsmindevej and Carlsmindeparken. J√ºrgensen was a central figure at Klampenborg Racecourses. In 1913 he constructed the side wing with stables for nine horses. A later owner, Erik M√∏ller, a CEO, established a riding ground to the rear of the stables in the 1950s. Venstre acquired the property in 1970 and has been based there since 1971. Architecture The building seen from the garden The main building fronts a large courtyard located on the southside of S√∏ller√∏dsvej. A detached side wing marks the east side of the courtyard. The side wing The main building is 11 bays long and consists of a high cellar, bel √©tage and a hipped Mansard roof with blue-glazed tiles. The three-bay median risalit was adapted in the 1893. The two windows that flanked the main entrance were replaced by niches with sandstone vases. The Rococo-style Cartouche above the main entrance and the Neclassical attica was also added at this point. The combination of decorative elements from different architectural styles is a characteristic feature of the Historicist style that dominated Danish architecture in the 1890s. The side wing contains two small apartments flanking a stable with room for nine horses. The northern gable of the side wing is integrated in the wall that partly surrounds the property. Today The secretariat of Venstre is based in the building. The garden is used for events on Constitution Day (5 June).

The henge, which has been almost completely flattened, was only discovered in the 20th century. Geophysical surveys and excavation have uncovered many of its features, which include a northeast entrance, an internal circle of postholes, and fragments of bone and pottery. Location Coneybury Henge is around 1.4 kilometres east-by-southeast of Stonehenge, which can be seen from the site. The location has extensive views southeast across the Avon valley, and west towards Normanton Down. The henge is difficult to identify on the ground, having been levelled by ploughing, but has been identified on aerial photographs, geophysical survey, and by excavation. The absence of any mention of the henge in historical records suggests that it may have been levelled in medieval times or soon after, and this theory is supported by ridge and furrow marks visible on some aerial photographs. Discovery and excavation The site was first noted from the air in the 1920s and thought to be a disc barrow. Later aerial photographs gave strong indications it was a Class I henge. The photographs show an oval ditch, around 45 metres by 55 metres in diameter. The entrance is on the longer axis on the northeast side. Traces of an external bank are said to be visible. The henge was excavated in 1980 as part of the Stonehenge Environs Project. The excavations revealed a broad oval ditch around 4 metres wide by 3 metres deep defining the henge. Excavation of internal features included a few pits and postholes, numerous stakeholes, and an arc of postholes inside the inner edge of the enclosure ditch which may have represented a post circle. Some of the internal features may pre-date the henge. Finds included pottery ranging from the early Neolithic to middle Bronze Age, as well as animal bone and a human cremation. Coneybury Anomaly Around 12 metres northwest of Coneybury Henge, evidence suggesting a unique cross-cultural feast has been found. The Anomaly is a pit containing a large amount of early Neolithic pottery together with a large quantity of animal bone, and flint tools of both Mesolithic and Neolithic types. The bones included at least ten cattle, plus several roe deer, two red deer and a pig. The material was radiocarbon dated to 3980-3708 BCE, before the henge was constructed and within three centuries of the introduction of Neolithic technology to Britain. It is interpreted as the result of a single event, not a long occupation or recurrent use. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The ceramic assemblage included bowls and cups, all of rather similar manufacture. Many of the fragments were large, indicating that they have not been trampled after they were discarded, and thus that a single, relatively short event led to the Anomaly.Richards, J. (ed.) 1990. The Stonehenge Environs Project. London: English Heritage Archaeological Reports 16/ York: Archaeology Data Service https://doi.org/ 10.5284/1028203 The cattle were not butchered in the same way as the roe deer; most limbs of the cattle are absent - possibly redistributed among participants - while the deer bones remained in the pit. Isotope ratios in the bones indicated that all the animals came from within 20km of Coneybury. They included at least three groups of cattle, each from a different place and comprising individuals of multiple ages, while the deer all came from the immediate neighbourhood. The cattle were all female and had grazed on open ground; they had not eaten straw from manured cereal plots. The primary pit Ô¨Åll includes both Neolithic and Mesolithic tool types. There is no obvious source from which residual Mesolithic material could be derived, and no evidence of differential weathering. The blades/blade-lets must therefore be part of the event that caused the Anomaly. This intimate mixture of Neolithic and Mesolithic tools is unique, and seems to indicate a single event attended by two different cultural groups. The excavators suggest that the Coneybury Anomaly represents the material remains of a gathering organized by a regional community, with participants coming from different areas. One group of attendees provided deer instead of, or in addition to, cattle. This group may have been hunter-gatherers who survived alongside farmers, engaging with them in a solidarity feast which requires equivalent contributions from participants and maintains community cohesion. If this is correct, the regional feasts that have been suggested for the later causewayed enclosures were already taking place in the earliest Neolithic phase, albeit on a smaller geographical scale.

She never married. As an adult, she was active as a music- and language teacher in Stockholm for many years. From 1847, Brooman was engaged as a teacher in the school of the actors- and ballet students at the royal theater and opera in Stockholm, the Dramatens elevskola. Except for the period of 1851-56, she kept this post until her retirement in 1884. The students of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Royal Swedish Opera and Royal Swedish Ballet during this period started as children, and though they were instructed in their future profession by experts, they were also given instruction in elementary subjects. This part of their education had previously been provided by the head of the Dramatens elevskola, and the students had been housed as boarding school students in the home of Christina Fundin (mother of Wilhelmina Fundin), but the boarding school of Fundin was closed in 1846, and Brooman was employed to provide the elementary education schooling to the students. Hanna Brooman provided instruction in Christianity, Writing, piano forte, French, German, Italian, history and geography for both male and female students, as well as sewing and needlework for the girls. Erik af Edholm described her as \\"a good teacher and person\\" (1869), and Frans Hedberg described her in his necrology: :\\"She taught with the heart as much as with her reason; with an unusually rich, patient, never undying love, as far away from all indulgence as well as from all bad tempered mastering, as warm for the greater gifts as well as for the small, yes, often more tenderly for the spiritually poor than for those, which whom the conscientious teacher could have glowed, if it had been her nature.\\"J (Hanna) A Brooman, urn:sbl:17030, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av T.

For example, they suggested that the USG should invest more in business ventures, and use the toolbox of taxes and subsidies to encourage innovation. They also suggested that the government should let entrepreneurs address social ills, as in the case of charter schools. They added educated immigrants should be given green cards to improve the rate of human capital in the United States. Moreover, they suggested that capital markets should be liberated from unnecessary regulations. They also suggested that the government should publish financial data and encourage dialogue between trade organizations, and discourage unfair competition by banning monopolies. Additionally, they noted that the government should do away with Obamacare and encourage entrepreneurship in healthcare; lower taxes; find the right balance in protecting intellectual rights to enable innovation; maintain flexible dismissals; and reduce political gridlock.

Acoustic noise and vibrations due to electromagnetic forces can be seen as the reciprocal of microphonics, which describes how a mechanical vibration or acoustic noise can induce an undesired electrical perturbation.  General explanation  Electromagnetic forces can be defined as forces arising from the presence of an electromagnetic field (electrical field only, magnetic field only, or both). Electromagnetic forces in the presence of a magnetic field include equivalent forces due to Maxwell stress tensor, magnetostriction and Lorentz force (also called Laplace force)Belahcen, A. (2004). Magnetoelasticity, magnetic forces and magnetostriction in electrical machines. PhD thesis, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland.. Maxwell forces, also called reluctances forces, are concentrated at the interface of high magnetic reluctivity changes, e.g. between air and a ferromagnetic material in electric machines; they are also responsible of the attraction or repulsion of two magnets facing each other. Magnetostriction forces are concentrated inside the ferromagnetic material itself. Lorentz or Laplace forces act on conductors plunged in an external magnetic field. Equivalent electromagnetic forces due to the presence of an electrical field can involve electrostatic, electrostrictive and reverse piezoelectric effects. These phenomena can potentially generate vibrations of the ferromagnetic, conductive parts, coils and permanent magnets of electrical, magnetic and electromechanical device, resulting in an audible sound if the frequency of vibrations lies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, and if the sound level is high enough to be heard (e.g. large surface of radiation and large vibration levels). Vibration level is increased in case of a mechanical resonance, when electromagnetic forces match with a structural mode natural frequency of the active component (magnetic circuit, electromagnetic coil or electrical circuit) or of its enclosure. The frequency of the noise depends on the nature of electromagnetic forces (quadratic or linear function of electrical field or magnetic field) and on the frequency content of the electromagnetic field (in particular if a DC component is present or not).  Electromagnetic noise and vibrations in electric machines  Electromagnetic torque, which can be calculated as the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor along the airgap, is one consequence of electromagnetic forces in electric machines. As a static force, it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force creating torsional vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitationTan Kim A.

Some tangential magnetic force harmonics can directly create magnetic vibrations and acoustic noise when applied to the stator teeth: tangential forces create a bending moment of the stator teeth, resulting in radial vibrations of the yoke Devillers E., Le Besnerais J., Regniez M. and Hecquet M., (2017).

Besides tangential force harmonics, Maxwell stress also includes radial force harmonics responsible for radial vibrations of the yoke, which in turn can radiate acoustic noise.  Electromagnetic noise and vibrations in passive components  = Inductors = In inductors, also called reactors or chokes, magnetic energy is stored in the airgap of the magnetic circuit, where large Maxwell forces apply.

Resonance effect in electrical machines  In radial flux rotating electric machines, resonance due to electromagnetic forces is particular as it occurs at two conditions: there must be a match between the exciting Maxwell force and the stator or rotor natural frequency, and between the stator or rotor modal shape and the exciting Maxwell harmonic wavenumber (periodicity of the force along the airgap)Le Besnerais, J.

Under resonance conditions, the maxima of the electromagnetic excitation along the airgap and the maxima of the modal shape displacement are in phase.  Numerical simulation  = Methodology = The simulation of electromagnetically induced noise and vibrations is a multiphysic modeling process carried in three steps: * calculation of the electromagnetic forces * calculation of the resulting magnetic vibrations * calculation of the resulting magnetic noise It is generally considered as a weakly coupled problem: the deformation of the structure under electromagnetic forces is assumed not to change significantly the electromagnetic field distribution and the resulting electromagnetic stress. = Application to electric machines = The assessment of audible magnetic noise in electrical machines can be done using three methods: * using dedicated electromagnetic and vibro-acoustic simulation software (e.g. MANATEE ) * using electromagnetic (e.g. Flux, Jmag, Maxwell, Opera), structural (e.g. Ansys Mechanical, Nastran, Optistruct) and acoustic (e.g. Actran, LMS, Sysnoise) numerical software together with dedicated coupling methods * using multiphysics numerical simulation software environment (e.g. Comsol Multiphysics, Ansys Workbench)  Examples of device subject to electromagnetic noise and vibrations  = Static devices = Static devices include electrical systems and components used in electric power storage or power conversion such as * inductors * transformersWeiser, B., Pf√ºtzner, H., & Anger, J.

Early life and education  Counts was born and raised in New York City, the son of Carolyn Counts Fox (n√©e Lawler) and Dr. Robert Milton Counts. He studied Theatre and Economics at Skidmore College from 1988 to 1993, where he created The Life and Times of Lewis Carroll, a performance that was both an abstract re-interpretation of Alice In Wonderland and a poetic performative portrait of Lewis Carroll. At Skidmore, Counts also created the \\"Failure Series\\", an open forum of experimental performance concepts that continued after he graduated under the leadership of collaborators Ian Belton http://www.skidmoretheaternews.com/people/2016/4/6/rebel-director-ian-beltons- nomadic-journey and Yehuda Duenyas.http://theascent.co/#/about The series included a wide range of performance, theatrical, operatic and scenic elements spread over several acres of Skidmore Campus which anticipated much of his later work with immersive performance installations and theater. His most notable influences from his time at Skidmore were Gautam Dasguptahttp://www.skidmoretheaternews.com/new- blog/2016/2/25/ads88xz1wgmr6b4xs6mlpen0ir8pi9 and his then wife, Bonnie Marranca, co-founders of the PAJ: Performing Arts Journal. Counts went on to study with Dasgupta off and on for the next 20 years.http://scholar.colorado.edu/thtr_gradetds/27  Career  = Theater and Performance = In his formative years, Counts was drawn to the work of theater and visual artists who forged idiosyncratic and often fiercely independent artistic paths, including Robert Wilson, Reza Abdoh, Richard Foreman, Joseph Cornell, John Cage and Merce Cunningham, Robert Rauschenberg, Marcel Duchamp, Antonin Artaud, and Gertrude Stein. A common thread is the way the work of these artists was fueled by a subconscious or non-literal dynamic generated through collisions and confluences along the intersections of visual art, literature, music, sound, and live performance. After graduating from Skidmore, Counts founded the C & Hammermill Company and Exhibition Space in a 100 ft.-long warehouse in Saratoga Springs. Counts collaborated with company members on a series of installations, site-specific performances and guerrilla artworks on the Fifth Avenue promenade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a 40-acre estate in Devon, Pennsylvania (Waterloo Mills and the Kings of Prussia), and the streets of Prague in the Czech Republic (Frontier and the Kings of Prussia, a seven-day site specific guerrilla theater production performed in 14 different outdoor locations, and Kral, an abstract re- interpretation of King Lear staged in a prewar movie theater that had been converted into a night club). When he moved back to New York City, he co- founded GAle GAtes et al. ‚Äì a name inspired by Counts‚Äô grandmother ‚ÄúShe was a brilliant woman. Spoke eight languages. Was one of the first women to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Extremely cultured. But it was her relationship to paintings that was my introduction to the visual arts as a child. She inspired me with this idea that at the most fundamental level the idea of making art is giving a gift. A celebration. It should elevate us. Even if it can be dark and cerebral, it‚Äôs still this idea of putting your hand out, this ‚Äúlet me show you something beautiful and challenging.‚Äù The core tenets of what is my aesthetic and what I think about art and my relationship with it is derived from my relationship with her, so naming the company after her was a very logical thing to do. What she thought art was, was going to be ever foundational to what the company did.‚Äù Michael Counts, 19 September 2012. ‚Äì with performer and producer Michelle Stern and scholar and Butoh performer John Oglevee, whom Counts had met in Prague and had made the introduction to Stern on their return. With the help of the LMCC, where the embryonic company had been appointed Artist-in-Residence, Counts was able to work with vast spatial ‚Äúcanvases‚Äù right away, securing temporary use of the vacant floors of skyscrapers in the financial district which provided the epic perspectives that have remained an essential aspect of his work. After creating his second work for the Metropolitan Museum of Art promenade, The Making of a Mountain, in 1995, Counts directed and designed a series of performances and installations from 1996 to 1997 in multiple indoor and outdoor locations in Manhattan and in touring residencies in Thailand and Japan, gathering a growing circle of artistic collaborators along the way. In New York, 90 Degrees from an Equinox? Where are We? And Where are We Going? was a twelve- hour performance installation that took place over the course of six days in a 65,000 sq. ft. space on the 51st floor of 55 Water Street. Texts by Gertrude Stein and John Cage were performed alongside original and found texts by actors performing in an environment made of a field of wild grass harvested from Jamaica Bay. wine-blue-open-water was a walk-through performance installation freely adapted from Homer‚Äôs Odyssey with a pre-recorded text by Ruth Margraff. Set elements were rolled in on wagons past performers stationed like statues on a vacant floor of 67 Broad Street. Counts and the company also produced Oh‚Ä¶ A Fifty-Year Dart (a series of episodes that unfolded over the course of three months), Departure, Ark, and TO SEA: Another Mountain at a range of locations including Grand Central Terminal, the SoHo Arts Festival and the Tunnel nightclub. Internationally, a nine-member company went to Thailand to collaborate with the BoiSakti Dance Theatre of Indonesia under the auspices of the Bangkok-Bali-Berlin Festival, and Counts, Stern and Oglevee were joined by composer Joseph Diebes to study Butoh at Min Tanaka‚Äôs Body Weather Farm in Japan. At the Farm, Counts directed and designed I Dug a Pit a Meter Six in Either Direction and Filled it Full of Sake. I Mixed in Honey and Milk and Poured It Over Barley and Pine Nuts and Rice and Onion and Fruit and Blood and Stopped. The performance was set halfway up a mountain, requiring the audience to make an arduous hike then descend at night, the experience of which was integrated into the performance concept. Counts described the work as occupying the territory ‚Äúwhen dance-theatre starts to bleed more into proper theater‚Äù. After completing the LMCC residency, Counts began to search for a permanent home for the company that could accommodate the cinematic perspectives that were now a constant in his work. Brooklyn Academy of Music Executive Producer Joseph V. Melillo pointed him to the Brooklyn waterfront neighborhood now known as DUMBO, where David Walentas of Two Trees Management offered him a lease for a 40,000 square foot warehouse and shopfront gallery in exchange for the company attracting a steady stream of visitors to what was then a somewhat forbidding neighborhood. Counts, Stern and Diebes were joined by resident artists Michael Anderson, Tom Fruin and Jeff Sugg to create four large-scale performance installations and mount numerous exhibitions and off- site events over the following five years. To SEA: Another Ocean, a performance installation for four performers and 500 blue umbrellas, marked the official opening of the space in September 1997. The first fully staged production Counts directed and designed in the new space was The Field of Mars, which was inspired by Tacitus‚Äô account of the burning of Rome. A one- line summary in the playbill read \\"This performance is as a dream is, or a landscape. Its meaning is more or less what you determine.\\" The pre-show began in the shopfront gallery as the audience milled around a bar and one by one noticed an actor dressed in elegant evening wear suspended high above on a wire. He descended a ladder with his hands, then led the audience up a ramp decorated with a frieze of tiny flames (a reference to the Great Fire of Rome) to the warehouse space above, where they encountered a series of episodes described in The New York Times as ‚Äúa fun house for the senses‚Ä¶ a cascade of images conjured by the conscious and subconscious, and with the question of how pictures framed in the mind's eye make their way into everything, from ancient myth to abstract paintings to commercial movies.\\" The audience was guided through multiple installations by intelligent and moving stage lights and Diebes‚Äô through-composed electronic score: a living room whose back wall disappeared to reveal a pixie in a slowly receding forest, a tryst in a public bathroom mounted on wheels and swirling around the space, a family dinner at an ornate and extravagantly long table, a tartan-skirted schoolgirl emerging from the top of a wardrobe, and more. A sequel, The Field of Mars - Chapter 1, was mounted in 2006 by Counts Media, in which groups of six people were guided through multiple locations in mid-Manhattan including Grand Central Terminal, a Park Avenue office building, a minivan, the basement of a manufacturing building in the Fashion District, and the interior of a Lincoln Continental. The Field of Mars ‚Äì Chapter 1 was produced in part as a developmental workshop for The Ride, a commercial entertainment concept developed with a group that included Broadway producers Robyn Goodman, Vivek Tiwary, Charles Flateman, Barry Tatelman and media executive Scott Carlin. The Field of Mars ‚Äì Chapter 1 also anticipated Counts' 2017 work, The Path of Beatrice, an extension of his immersive escape room Paradiso. Tilly Losch, produced later in 1998 and described by Counts as ‚Äúa dream one might have had if falling asleep after watching Casablanca‚Äù, took its inspiration from the eponymous shadow box sculpture by Joseph Cornell. It was the first of two GAle GAtes et al. productions in which the audience was seated for the duration so that the 120 feet throw of the backstage area was visible through the false proscenium of an industrial passageway. The proscenium was initially masked by a backdrop as a series of vignettes played out in front - two soldiers playing chess, a row of seated cinemagoers rolling across the stage on casters to audio from the film Casablanca, a Butoh solo. The proscenium then opened up to reveal a series of shadow box-like scenes that receded further and further back into the space as the action progressed ‚Äì a couple arguing in one window and a pensive man listening to Nina Simone in another in a recreated section of the Met Life Building Clock Tower facade and a recreation of Andrew Wyeth's painting Christina's World. Christina was portrayed as having lost the use of her legs and dragging herself into position to the sounds of birdcalls, crickets and gusts of wind. The sun set at the same pace it does in real time, and lights in the model house on the hill turned on one by one. The scene concluded after a model hot air balloon and an airplane appeared far off in the sky. In the climactic scene - a recreation of the titular Cornell work - the hot air balloon was shown in virtual close-up as a performer floated through a frame suspended on wires. The advantages of having permanent access to a warehouse space began to be fully utilized in Tilly Losch. Set elements could be tinkered with and refined over the course of months. A new mechanism was developed that could tilt a wall imperceptibly over the course of two minutes, operated by hand wrenches. The title of 1839 (1999) refers to the year photography was invented, and was conceived as a dream of Daguerre ‚Äúin which a child, in the guise of Oedipus, wanders through a landscape peopled by narcissists in love with their own photographed images.‚Äù The landscape was a kinetic collage of multi-layered, allusive imagery. There were yet more three- dimensional reproductions of artworks ‚Äì Manet‚Äôs Olympia, a large classical still life, a cat from a Balthus painting ‚Äì interwoven with invented scenarios. A hermaphrodite appeared in different guises, at one point dressed in a sailor costume identical to the ones adorning a statue of a child and worn by the Oedipus character. An armadillo puppet stood up on its hind legs to reveal a naked young woman on whose skin an image of the solar system was projected. There were multiple scenes involving a surreally distanced Oedipal coupling of two actors who recited a combination of Sophocles and invented texts. At one point, the Oedipus figure shot arrows across the full throw of the backstage area at a circle of light as the Jocasta character looked on. In 2000, Counts was invited to direct Gertrude Stein‚Äôs Listen to Me at the CalArts Center for New Performance in Valencia, California. The production featured three iterations of the same three characters: a man dressed alternately in a snowsuit and a schoolboy‚Äôs uniform; a woman also appearing in multiple incarnations including an opulent 18th century white wig topped by a silver model of a three-masted sailing ship; and an art museum guard. The stage design featured a series of sunken trenches created by rows of white cuboids that extended the width of the stage and rose to chest height, and a suspended walkway above. The choreography was by Ken Roht, who had previously worked with Reza Abdoh and became a frequent collaborator of Counts‚Äô in the years following.  A Counts Performance Installation Scene by Scene: So Long Ago I Can‚Äôt Remember  The last large-scale performance installation produced by GAle GAtes et al. in DUMBO was So Long Ago I Can‚Äôt Remember (2001) a free adaptation of Dante‚Äôs The Divine Comedy with a text by Kevin Oakes pre- recorded by the actors (who lip-synched their lines in the live performance) and choreography by Roht. So Long Ago marked a return to the walk-through format of previous performance installations. Dante‚Äôs nine circles of hell were depicted in a series of installations in which audience members alternately roamed and were seated as multiple performances unfolded around them - and, at some points, in their midst. The audience entered through the back of the warehouse for the first time and took their seats at cafe tables. A dominatrix-like mistress of ceremonies portraying Virgil - the only performer whose words were not pre-recorded - issued instructions on how to move through the space and rules for interacting with the performers. A chorus of women in elegant modern matching suits with fur collars appeared, one in the attitude of walking a statue of a greyhound sitting stiffly at attention, followed by a solitary male actor also in elegant modern clothing (Counts‚Äô Dante). He stopped in front of an opening in a large wall which then tipped over and fell to the floor around him, pushing a strong gust of wind out at the audience.A reference to a scene in Buster Keaton‚Äôs Steamboat Bill, Jr. in which the facade of a house falls on Keaton who, having been standing in the trajectory of a windowframe, was unscathed. The actor was then joined by an actress for a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers tap routine. They exited to reveal a boatful of lost souls crossing the river Styx. The audience was then guided sometimes by the dominatrix, sometimes through the gestures of the characters, sometimes by light or sound through a succession of long narrow spaces representing the rings of hell. In the next installation, members of a dysfunctional family stood on a platform that spanned the width of the space forming a kinetic frieze, their arguments abstracted through multiple distancing layers of time, space and verbal embellishment. At one end of the frieze stood a clutch of Nazi soldiers speaking German, at the other, a girl in a red dress reciting text on a swing. A hanged man in a fedora clutching a violin case appeared, and a chorus of dancers performed a Vegas floor show decked out in headdresses, shiny bikinis and high heels, first fully costumed but later either nude or bare-breasted wearing an assortment of briefs. The next space featured a floor covered with sand and a Florentine stone wall where an ailing Pope delivered a monologue as Dante and two clerics looked on. The audience was then led behind the stone wall and seated as they observed a maid, a pair of hotel guests, and two gangsters move wordlessly in and out of a hallway in the Waldorf Astoria as a mafia hit may or may not have taken place behind one of the doors. The wall was then winched up to reveal a chorus of dancers wearing the same red dress as the girl on the swing, who stepped forward to deliver a monologue while exiting. The second act began with a speech by the anarchist labor organizer Emma Goldman envisioning a bleak future for the workers. The audience was then led across a bridge spanning a pool of white fluorescent lights as Dante stood silently by in 13th century costume, head bowed. The bridge led to a small space in which the audience huddled around a quartet of seated actors lit from below in ghoulish green light delivering a string of non-sequiturs about a Pomeranian. This was followed by Purgatorio, a twenty-minute wordless opera for a seated audience by Diebes. Four sopranos wandered among ostensibly artificial tree trunks made of rags and painted black. The actor playing Dante doubled as a young man in modern dress burying an undisclosed treasure in the dirt. The performance concluded with Paradiso. The girl in the red dress was suspended over a pool of dry ice that spanned the entire floor of the shopfront gallery as the couple that had previously been seen in the hotel hallway mounted a stairway leading up to a place beyond view. The audience observed the scene while walking over an elevated walkway as Manhattan's East River skyline appeared across the water through the shopfront windows of the gallery. The walkway took the audience through the gallery entrance onto the street. There was no curtain call.  Theatre after 9/11  The events of 9/11 took place a few weeks after So Long Ago closed. In the aftermath, there was a significant shift in Counts‚Äô work back towards his original intentions for doing site- specific works outdoors for unsuspecting audiences. The only theatre production Counts has directed since was Play/Date, a site specific ‚Äúimmersive theatre experience‚Äù produced by 3 Legged Dog and installed in the three levels of the Fat Baby nightclub on the Lower East Side. Actors were initially stationed at tables throughout the space, performing scenes written by multiple playwrights portraying blind dates, late night hook-ups, star-crossed text messaging, break-ups, and unrequited love. The audience was invited to join any of a number of scenes taking place simultaneously as the amplified conversations were projected through a sound system while multiple digital screens in the seating areas displayed courtships by text. = Opera and Orchestral Music = In 2011, Director of New York City Opera (NYCO) George Steel invited Counts to direct and design a new production entitled Monodramas at Lincoln Center. Monodramas was an evening of works for solo soprano and orchestra: the world stage premiere of La Machine de l'√ätre by John Zorn, Erwartung by Arnold Schoenberg, and the US stage premiere of Neither by Morton Feldman, with a libretto by Samuel Beckett. Steel had first encountered Counts‚Äô work at GAle GAtes et al. and had been in discussions about presenting performances of John Cage in the GAle GAtes et al. space prior to 9/11. The production featured episodes that provided a through line tying all of the works together, bookended by an intro and outro performed in silence. In 2012, Counts was invited by New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert to direct and design New York Philharmonic 360, a staging of ‚Äúspatial music‚Äù for orchestra in the Park Avenue Armory‚Äôs Drill Hall presented in-the-round. Counts designed an immersive lighting and performance environment for works by Gabrieli, Boulez, Mozart, Stockhausen and Ives that included living statues costumed for their subsequent performance of the Act I finale of Mozart's \\"Don Giovanni\\" which the audience encountered in a space under the bleachers upon entering, and large luminous screens installed behind each orchestra that glowed in blue, red and yellow. There were three orchestras for Stockhausen's Gruppen, arranged in a circle, with audience sections in the center and in between. The performance was featured in a free worldwide webcast on Medici.tv. Counts returned to New York City Opera in 2013 to direct and design Rossini‚Äôs Moses in Egypt. The set design featured a backdrop of LED screens displaying imagery created in collaboration with Ada Whitney, co-founder and creative director of . Animations of night skies, deserts, and the parting of the Red Sea were interspersed with abstract shapes and video of natural forms. Through the use of an LED backdrop, Counts was able to realize on a big screen the cinematic pans and aerial shots that had been an implied element of his live stage work, while adding new effects through confronting the invented time on the LED screens with the real time of the live performance, partly through the use of a revolving stage. Moses in Egypt marked the first time New York City Opera had performed in its original home, City Center, since moving to Lincoln Center in the mid ‚Äò60s. In 2016, Counts staged the world premiere of the seven-hour The Ouroboros Trilogy, a production by Beth Morrison Projects presented by Arts Emerson at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in Boston, MA. The work united three scores by Scott Wheeler (Naga), Zhou Long (the Pulitzer Prize-winning Madame White Snake) and Paola Prestini (Gilgamesh) under the umbrella of libretti written by a single author, Cerise Lim Jacobs. Madame White Snake was presented at the Hong Kong Arts Festival in March 2019https://www.hk.artsfestival.org/en/programmes/opera-madame-white-snake-by- zhou-long-and-cerise-lim-jacobs/. = Immersive and Interactive Events and Installations = While virtually all of Counts‚Äô works prior to 2002 could be categorized as immersive events, his work in theatre, visual art and interactive installation after 9/11 developed along separate tracks. The first work Counts created after 9/11 was Looking Forward, a video homage to New York City mounted in April‚ÄìMay 2002 in the clock faces of the DUMBO clocktower. A looped series of video portraits showed the faces of volunteers who had recorded messages describing ‚ÄúNew York moments‚Äù. The audio of the voices of the New Yorkers who were interviewed, set to an original soundtrack, was simulcast by WFMU on May 3. Looking Forward was followed by (and was a prelude for) The World: An Immersive Installation Performance, a series of interactive events that returned to the format of Counts' earlier works in which an overarching, open-ended narrative would unfold in multiple episodes staged in different locations over a period of months. For the prelude, two dozen writers were invited to respond to a group of miniature cinematic vistas and environments created by Counts that situated dozens of figurines on surreal landscapes, and the resulting playtexts were presented in public readings. The first episode was a performance installation at the Whitney Museum of Art‚Äôs Annex at the Altria Atrium in Midtown Manhattan inspired by the texts. The second episode was presented by the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, NY. Multiple sets and dioramas were installed in the windows and parking spaces of a nearby restaurant, including a vintage red Ferrari dino illuminated by red stage lights and silent characters appearing one by one in the dioramas and atop an elevated outdoor platform under placards in the shape of speech bubbles on which wordless video collages were projected. After GAle GAtes et al. closed in 2003, Counts embarked on a series of interactive works situated in the public realm. In Yellow Arrow (2004), Counts collaborated with Christopher Allen, Brian House, and Jesse Shapins to create ‚ÄúMassively Authored Public Art‚Äù that was a forerunner of the geospatial web in its creation of a ‚Äúdeep map‚Äù of the world. Volunteers who submitted online requests were sent coded stickers by mail and asked to write a message, place the stickers in a location of their choice, and submit a photograph of the site by SMS. In 2005 Counts and the Yellow Arrow Mobile App/Global Public Art Project created an immersive installation and exhibition for Piaget at Art Basel Miami, and in 2006 extended the scope of the project to an augmented reality game called ICUH8ING. An estimated 7,535 Yellow Arrow stickers were placed in 467 cities and 35 countries worldwide.. In 2007/8, Counts founded Counts Media and raised financing to fully realize the conceptual blueprints for Yellow Arrow and two digital projects created, directed and designed for the Blue Man Group - Mobkastr; an early application of mobile technology to performance designed for the North American tour of How to be a Megastar); and BILL: The World‚Äôs First Live and Interactive Video Billboard in Las Vegas. 2010 saw the launch of The Ride, a custom-designed bus tour along a 4.2 mile route through Mid-Manhattan. The bus seats were turned to the side so that the audience could look directly at the sidewalks, where live performers would appear including a UPS delivery man who launched into a breakdance, a ballet duet on Columbus Circle, a rapper improvising rhymes to pedestrians on 42nd Street, and a re-enactment of Alfred Eisenstaedt‚Äôs photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square on V-J Day. Each bus was equipped with a sound system and dozens of synchronized video monitors. Two tour guides played the roles of urban researchers as they introduced each new sight and videos with historical and statistical background played on the screens. Beginning in 2014, Counts renewed his work on immersive live performance in events that crossed over into the worlds of fashion and television. As Creative Director of the Jet Set Event for Michael Kors in Shanghai, Counts utilized a large eyeliner video projection screen in an aircraft hangar (Hongquiao Airport in Shanghai, China) where a private jet plane was parked. The same year, he was creative consultant and stage director for Walking Dead Escape, an immersive theatrical adaptation of the Walking Dead Comics and AMC television show produced by Skybound EXP at the Hartford Xfinity Theatre and at Petco Park for the San Diego International Comic Con. Counts then wrote, directed and produced The Walking Dead Experience ‚Äì Chapter 1 in partnership with Walker Stalker Con. Groups of seven people were dropped into a sequence of encounters lasting 30 minutes that rendered a small town in the throes of a deadly outbreak, all set in a 10,000 square foot immersive space with special effects. In 2016, Michael Counts conceived, designed and directed a fashion show concept and presentation in collaboration with Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff for the Betty & Veronica by Rachel Antonoff brand at New York Fashion Week which combined the aesthetics of comics and pop art with high fashion in anticipation of the launch of Riverdale on the CW. Also in 2016, Counts partnered with former Jerry Bruckheimer producer and Las Vegas nightclub impresario Jennifer Worthington to create PARADISO: Chapter 1, an immersive escape room adaptated from Dante‚Äôs The Divine Comedy. Groups of ten gamers moved through a series of five interconnected chapters in which they periodically encountered live performers in interiors conceived as the premises of the Virgil Corporation. In March 2017, Counts and his Paradiso creative team launched The Path of Beatrice, an extension of PARADISO: Chapter 1 that took audience members in small groups of 1-4 people through a series of real world experiences over the course of a week, referencing the David Fincher film The Game and 2013 cult film The Institute. = Visual Art = GAle GAtes et al.‚Äôs move to a permanent home in 1995 brought with it an obligation to attract a steady flow of visitors. Initially with Stern and later with New York City gallerists including Mike Weiss, Counts co-organized a series of exhibitions from 1996 to 1999 that attracted a steady flow of visitors to the DUMBO shopfront gallery. In 2001-2, Counts collaborated with Bob Bangiola (then at New York's Brooklyn Academy of Music), and Anne Ellegood (now Executive Director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles), on organizing the Emerging Curator Series, whose unifying principle was viewing the curator as an artist. While there was resistance to this concept in New York's visual arts establishment, the series became a valued early career platform for curators and artists who soon thereafter rose to prominence in the art world. A few years later, curators in the US were widely regarded as having the capacity to be producing artists - as they already had been in Europe for some time - and scholarly articles were being written about the phenomenon. Concurrently, Counts was making small sculptures that rendered in miniature the same kinds of cinematic vistas and abstract theatrical environments he was designing for his large-scale installation and performance works. The sculptures were exhibited in solo shows in the GAle GAtes et al. gallery and at RARE Gallery and included in group shows and art fairs including Scope and Art Basel Miami) (with Step One Gallery). In 2011, Counts created a series of twelve sculptures that took key motifs from Monodramas, the evening of operas for soprano and orchestra he was directing and designing at Lincoln Center. Six of the twelve sculptures in the series, entitled Dream Sequence 3:52:29 am‚Äì3:56:12 am, were displayed in the lobby of the theatre during performances of Monodramas as visual elements integral to the experience of the evening as a whole. The other six sculptures were simultaneously exhibited at John McWhinnie at Glenn Horowitz. In 2016, Counts collaborated with Florida artist JEFR√ã and 3-Legged Dog on creating The Beacon and Code Wall, a six-story hyperbolic convex-concave tower animated by dynamic video designs commissioned by the Tavistock Development Company for the planned community of Lake Nona in Florida. = Talks and Presentations = Michael has been a featured speaker at MIT‚Äôs Media Lab, Omnicom‚Äôs Global Summit for the Radiate Group, and on panels hosted by City College and The Rockefeller Foundation. He has led workshops at several schools and other educational institutions including the California Institute of the Arts, Chiang Mai and Bangkok Universities, the Williamstown Theater Festival, and NYU‚Äôs Tisch School of the Arts. Michael‚Äôs media concepts have been presented at MIT and at Ericsson‚Äôs Innovation Lab in Stockholm. He launched A-Plan Coachinghttps://www.a-plancoaching.com/ in February 2018 and the iTunes podcast Producing Innovation in February 2019.  Style  A key inspiration for Counts‚Äô work is Wagner‚Äôs concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art in which all the various elements of drama ‚Äì music, sound, text, movement, set and costume design ‚Äì are integrated into a unified whole. Another key inspiration is the work of the American director and designer Robert Wilson, to whom Counts is often compared and was a conscious influence. Some of the titles and locations of Counts‚Äô early work paid direct homage to Wilson.The Life and Times of Alice Liddell is a nod to Wilson‚Äôs own early work The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud, and I Dug a Pit a Meter Six in Either Direction and Filled it Full of Sake. I Mixed in Honey and Milk and Poured It Over Barley and Pine Nuts and Rice and Onion and Fruit and Blood and Stopped to Wilson‚Äôs I Was Sitting On My Patio This Guy Appeared I Thought I Was Hallucinating. Like Wilson‚Äôs KA MOUNTAIN AND GUARDenia TERRACE: a story about a family and some people changing, I Dug a Pit was performed on an actual mountain. While there are clear similarities between their work, Counts emerged from Wilson's shadow and found his own voice relatively early in his career. This is arguably because Counts drew so deeply on the raw material of his own personal experiences in his work ‚Äì submerged as these were beneath multiple layers of allusion. Some have speculated that the reason his work continues to draw routine comparison with Wilson is due to the decline in the number of avant-garde artists active in performance beginning in the 1990s. In other words, the contexts in which his work could be fully understood and appreciated have narrowed considerably ‚Äì there simply aren‚Äôt many other artists to compare him to. Counts‚Äô performance installations featured stylized movement that could take many forms, often infused with an erotic charge. Although key performers he worked with had undergone intensive studies in Butoh, this was not an influence on his own directorial approach but rather one of many elements within it (except in terms of the level of concentration, discipline and physical control required throughout, which could be considerable). After 2000, he began working regularly with choreographer Ken Roht, who performed with Reza Abdoh‚Äôs company Dar-a-Luz and served as Adboh‚Äôs choreographer on many productions. = Immersive Environments = A constant thread in Counts' work is the experience of immersion. In his own words: ‚Ä≥My approach with all the things I‚Äôve ever staged was to create a world and then immerse the audience in that world‚Ä¶ Creating an alternate reality where the rules were different but it held together. It might be very abstract, but it held a certain logic that the whole world operated within. It was then a compelling experience to be a voyeur in that world on the part of the audience.‚Ä≥ Counts arguably created his most highly developed immersive environments in GAle GAtes et al.‚Äôs 40,000 square foot warehouse space, which served as a kind of laboratory in which he incubated performance concepts that grew more and more elaborate and refined over the course of the five years the company was in residence. Many consider The Field of Mars and So Long Ago I Can‚Äôt Remember as the two productions that epitomize Counts‚Äô immersive theatre aesthetic. These two performance installations ‚Äì made before digital technology became a core component of his work and cast the public more fully in the role of author, and before the immersive genre went mainstream ‚Äì were mounted in the cavernous DUMBO warehouse space through which audience members were free to wander and choose their own individual perspectives on the action unfolding around them. The feeling of moving through Counts‚Äô fantasy landscapes added a layer of visceral complicity ‚Äì the physical sensation of the body traveling through space had the effect of ‚Ä≥warming up‚Äù the individual's imagination and made it all that much easier for willing viewers to immerse themselves in the unending flow of images, sounds and movement. This feeling can be compared to walking through the galleries of an art museum, much as Counts wandered through the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a child. In some of the sequences in The Field of Mars, the experience was more like exploring different rooms in a nightclub, or, in the eyes of Peter Marks of The New York Times, ‚Äú a little bit like chasing a two year old around an apartment.‚Äù In Art and America, Douglas Davis described the Field of Mars audience as ‚Äúdazzled witnesses to a cosmic event.‚Äù. In PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art, Michael Rush describes the experience of a Counts production as \\"akin to diving into a hypertext on the internet, but he‚Äôs doing all the clicking and controlling. It‚Äôs also like cruising through a fun house at the carnival, but the creatures popping out of the darkness aren‚Äôt just screaming, they‚Äôre reciting oblique texts from classical literature, art criticism, Fellini movies, and Dada playlets.\\" = Language = Counts‚Äô use of language in his original works is another area in which there was a significant change post 9/11. In the years preceding, he worked with complete scripts that were either compilations of text fragments lifted from a variety of sources or playtexts by a single author (including two scripts he wrote himself). Then, authorship shifted to public participants prompted by live performers, pre-set tasks and texts for apps and other digital platforms which superseded theatrical scripts at the heart of his work. The most important function of language in Counts‚Äô oeuvre is as source material which is then transformed into the conceptual underpinnings of his ultimate performative frameworks. Counts‚Äô description of how a book collection of the world's great letters was a seminal influence encapsulates this process: \\"There were various accounts. Dostoyevsky writing to his brother after he was almost assassinated, to letters of obscurity. It was a portrait of human history through correspondence. And that book changed my life. I would build pieces around some of the ideas and letters and relationships and the stories that were revealed.\\"  Private life  Counts lives in Brooklyn Heights with his wife Sharon and two sons, Wilder and Dashiell.

She then studied voice at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Karlsruhe and at the Musikhochschule Wien with Helena Lazarska. She was first engaged at the Lucerne Opera from 2002 to 2008 where she learned many parts of the mezzo-soprano repertoire, including Dorabella in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte, Charlotte in Massenet's Werther, Mrs. Quickly in Verdi's Falstaff, Giulietta in Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann, and Baba the Turc in Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress. In 2008, she studied the title role of Othmar Schoeck's Penthesilea with Hans Neuenfels for the Basel Opera, a production that received the award Inszenierung des Jahres (production of the year) by Opernwelt. Baumgartner has been a member of the ensemble of the Oper Frankfurt from the 2009/10 season, where her roles included Bizet's Carmen, Mary in Wagner's Der fliegende Holl√§nder, Eboli in Verdi's Don Carlos, Lisa in Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg's The Passenger, the Nurse in Die Frau ohne Schatten by Richard Strauss, again Penthesilea and Fricka in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the second of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the first of two in two months, the next was on November 29 and covered a part of the Northern Hemisphere. It was part of solar saros 111. Description The eclipse was visible in Northern and Southern Antarctica including the South Pole, a tiny portion near the Antarctic Peninsula, a tiny part of the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. It was during the decade that Antarctica was being explored by Europeans and added to the known atlas of the time. The eclipse started at sunrise in the Indian Ocean at around the 50th meridian east, it finished at sunset not far from the Antarctic Peninsula. It showed about up to 20-25% obscuration in Antarctica. The greatest eclipse was in Antarctica at 70.6 S, 21.2 E at 1:20 UTC (2:20 AM local time). The subsolar marking was in the Coral Sea.

He moved to Victoria from Toronto in 1995, taking a BA in Humanities from the University of Victoria, and touring with a rock band. In 2000 Budd then became the audio preservationist for CBC during its campaign to digitize its audio archives, including Nisga'a First Nation heritage. In 2002 he again attended the University of Victoria, where he completed his graduate degree in History. Voices of B.C. Budd is the host of the CBC Radio series Voices of B.C., where he recounts the stories of B.C. pioneers from tapings of their voices that were recorded in the 1950s and '60s by journalist Imbert Orchard. Budd is also the author of its companion book Voices of British Columbia: Stories from our Frontier, published in 2010. That year the book was nominated for a BC Book Prize. In 2014 he then released a follow-up book entitled Echoes of British Columbia; both books were sold alongside a three-CD set of 26 original pioneer recordings. Echoes was the 2nd prize for The Lieutenant-Governor's Medal for Historical Writing 2014.

This bastion, originally called the Basti√≥n de los Moros, is located on the side of the House of the Jesuits and is the work of Crist√≥bal de Roda. When it was completed by 1630, the cannons of San Ignacio pointed towards the Bay of Las √Ånimas, the same one that today receives the traffic of cabotage, and that then it extended by all the beach. Therefore, its mission was to discourage any attempt against the pier or against the banks and to contribute to the covering of Bocagrande (another entrance to the Bay of Cartagena). However, this purpose was threatened when the Society of Jesus built its college in the contiguous curtain. In fact, the neighborhood between a religious building and a military building generated all sorts of disputes, which were finally settled by the Spanish Crown, by order to build, on behalf of the Jesuits, a curtain of new wall a few meters ahead, leaving between the new and the old one a step of round, or way to watch from the fortification. The curtains are those straight and steep stretches of a \\"square front\\" that connects two bastions, in this case between those of San Ignacio and San Francisco Javier. Once the curtain was built it became necessary to move the bastion to the vicinity of the church of San Ignacio, from where it took its current name. Later, in 1730, the engineer Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor gave the bastion of San Ignacio its present dimension and annexed a garita, while it rescues its access ramp. From the house-college of the Jesuits (now the Naval Museum) it can see this bastion in all its splendor.

It was first aired on 27 December 2016 on BBC Two. The episode was directed by Graeme Harper and written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton. Stylistically, it took heavy inspiration from classic 1970s anthology programmes, such as Beasts, Thriller, Tales of the Unexpected and Armchair Thriller, and was filmed using authentic equipment. Pemberton intended the episode to be a recreation of this kind of classic programming, with critics characterising it as a homage, pastiche or loving parody. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\", which is set in December 1977, begins with an English family (played by Pemberton, Rula Lenska, Jessica Raine and George Bedford) arriving at an Austrian Alpine chalet, where their guide (played by Shearsmith) tells them the story of the Krampus. It shortly becomes apparent, however, that viewers are watching a film, and a director (voiced by Derek Jacobi) provides commentary on the events. The critical reception of \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" was very strong, with praise directed at the writing, acting and production. As a recreation of 1970s anthology programmes, it was considered a success. The ending, critics noted, was extremely dark; though many offered considerable praise for the final twist, a minority criticised it as gratuitously unpleasant. Production Jessica Raine (pictured, 2015) starred in the episode as Kathy. The second series of Inside No. 9 aired from 26 March to 29 April 2015. In May, Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton had talked about doing a third series, and were hopeful that they would be able to, but that the BBC had not yet requested one. A third series was confirmed by the BBC in October 2015. Further information, including hints at settings and confirmed performers, was released in January 2016, when the series began filming. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\", the first episode of this third series, was released as a Christmas special in December 2016, with the remainder of the series following in 2017. The episode can be understood as a part of the tradition of Christmas ghost stories, which includes the works of Charles Dickens and the BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas series. The inspiration for the use of the Krampus myth came from Pemberton's reading, while stylistic influence, according to Pemberton, came from \\"old '70s style\\" episodes of Beasts, Thriller and Tales of the Unexpected. For Pemberton, the 1970s style of the episode was a literal representation of what, metaphorically speaking, Inside No. 9 had been doing since the first series. The episode was variously described as a recreation or re-enactment of this source material, or else as a homage, a pastiche a \\"loving, but merciless\\" parody, or spoof of it. In addition to those influences mentioned by the writers, commentators identified Acorn Antiques, Psycho, Tales from the Crypt, Dead of Night, Whistle and I'll Come to You, and Garth Marenghi's Darkplace as potential influences. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" was filmed \\"in the style of a '70s portmanteau horror episode\\". This entailed the use of non-standard methods and technologies. The whole filming process took only two days, with the cast taking minimal breaks between shoots. For the actors, it was thus more like appearing in a play than a typical 21st century television filming experience. The episode was filmed on a set constructed at Studio D in the BBC Elstree Centre, run by BBC Studioworks, and authentic 1970s costumes and props were rented for the filming. The studio was retrofitted with cameras and lighting equipment that would have been used on a 1970s set, including three Ikegami HK 323 cameras and a single Ikegami HK323P camera, all provided by a company called Golden Age Recreations. The filming of the episode thus differed from the series's usual single-camera setup approach. Adam Tandy, Inside No. 9 producer, said that \\"Studio D has the heritage and familiar atmosphere that I remember from when I worked at Elstree in the 1980s; however, a lot of modernisation has taken place since then and this has allowed us to monitor our 4:3 625-line PAL pictures in BBC Studioworks' state of the art HD production gallery.\\" For Shearsmith, the result was that \\"it looks shit, but it's brilliant\\". The episode was directed by Graeme Harper, a veteran television director known for his work on Doctor Who. As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" stars Shearsmith as Klaus, Pemberton as Julian, Rula Lenska as Celia, Jessica Raine as Kathy, George Bedford as Toby, Derek Jacobi as Dennis Fulcher, Cavan Clerkin as the unnamed interviewer, and Naz Osmanoglu as the young Dennis Fulcher. Plot The episode opens with a clapper for a film named The Devil of Christmas. Set in December 1977, the film follows Julian, his pregnant wife Kathy, his mother Celia and his son Toby as they are shown into an Austrian Alpine chalet by Klaus. The party discuss their plans until Toby is struck by an unpleasant painting of the Krampus on the wall. In a voiceover, the film's director Dennis Fulcher talks to another man about the making of the film, in the style of an audio commentary. The video is rewound so Dennis can comment on a continuity error. He continues to discuss the film over the remainder of the episode, including commenting on the way that \\"Celia\\" misses her marks and fluffs her lines, and the way \\"Julian\\" says his lines too quickly in his eagerness to get to another job. Klaus tells of the Krampus, unnerving Kathy. Before bed, Toby leaves out his boots for the Krampus, and Kathy empties a bottle of tablets. The next morning, Toby's boots are filled with switches, indicating‚Äîaccording to Klaus's story‚Äîthat he has been visited by the Krampus due to his naughtiness. Celia suspects Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby tells of the wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads to bed, and Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced. That night, both Toby and Celia are out of bed, and the figure of the Krampus is seen. The next day, scratches are found on Toby's body, and Celia leaves with the child. That night, Julian finds that Kathy has scratches on her back, and the pair discover that her boots are stuffed with switches. Julian later finds Kathy downstairs. Celia calls to say she and Toby are safely home, and Kathy admits that her child is not Julian's. The Krampus snatches her, and Julian keels over, clutching his heart. He needs his medication, but Kathy watches him die, holding his empty pill bottle for him to see. \\"The Krampus\\" is revealed to be Klaus in a costume, but Klaus then removes a fake moustache and drops his accent; he is Simon, Kathy's lover. Fulcher explains that there is a final scene. The actors ready, and the scene begins: Kathy is on a bed, and pours Champagne. She is joined by Simon, still half-costumed, who chains her to the bed. Simon claims to be Krampus, and the scene ends with Kathy screaming as \\"Krampus\\" cackles. The actor playing \\"Krampus\\" leaves, with the actress playing Kathy believing the filming is over. The cameras keep rolling as plastic is put under \\"Kathy\\" by two Stagehands for a scene she did not know about. A new actor is dressed as the Krampus, and Kathy is roughly gagged by a stagehand. The new Krampus advances, armed with a machete; the older Dennis explains that \\"Kathy\\" understands, and that we are witnessing genuine fear. The tape cuts just as the machete is about to fall. Dennis says that he is surprised the tape has surfaced again, but that it was \\"one of the better ones\\"; The Devil of Christmas, unbeknownst to \\"Kathy\\", was a snuff film. Dennis's interviewer terminates the police interrogation. Reception Derek Jacobi (pictured, 2006) provided the voice of Dennis Fulcher, but does not appear on-camera. His commentary provided much of the episode's humour. For the most part, critics responded extremely positively to \\"The Devil of Christmas\\"; it was awarded five out of five stars by Adam White of The Telegraph, four out of five stars by James Jackson of The Times, and selected as \\"pick of the day\\" by Gerard Gilbert of i. It was praised as a fitting start to the series and as an entertaining Christmas special in its own right. Critics described it as \\"sublime\\" and \\"a treat\\"; it came \\"highly recommended\\" from the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, and the writer Matt Baylis summarised it as \\"horridly clever, wickedly good\\". Ian Hyland, writing for The Mirror in 2017, called it the most memorable television over the Christmas period. For him, the episode was almost as strong as \\"The 12 Days of Christine\\", in his view the best episode of Inside No. 9. Other critics did not place it as highly in comparison; Frances Taylor, writing for RadioTimes.com, listed \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" as the seventh best of the first 13 episodes. Both the comedic and horrific elements of the episode were praised. For White, the episode was \\"a demented, finely-honed comedy\\", though for Sally Newall, of The Independent, the comedic elements were less prominent. She described it as a \\"deliciously dark ... masterclass in the twisted, unsettling stuff that the League of Gentlemen and Psychoville creators do so well\\", but claimed that \\"a growing sense of doom\\" was more prevalent than \\"belly laughs\\". Dessau, too, commented on the lack of humour, while Chris Bennion, writing for the Saturday Review (of The Times) described it as \\"laugh-out-loud hilarious\\", while nonetheless \\"the stuff of nightmares\\". For White, much of the episode's strongest humour came from Dennis Fulcher's voice-over; Jackson called this a \\"pitch-perfect parody of a DVD commentary\\". Critics praised the cast for their hamming and effective delivery of what Bennion called the \\"stilted, stagy dialogue\\"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting \\"stellar\\". The attention to detail by the cast and crew was widely praised; the \\"dated styling\\" was, for Jackson, \\"spot on\\". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that \\"from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole\\". For her, \\"the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own‚Äîthese days you have to be very good to make TV that bad\\". White, similarly, argued that \\"it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics\\". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it \\"relatively gripping\\". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, \\"both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown\\". Commentators noted that the ending was genuinely unsettling and dark. Rachel Aroesti, writing for theguardian.com, described the episode as moving \\"from a twee period piece to what has to be the most depraved half-hour of television ever to grace the festive schedules\\". For many critics, the final twist was praiseworthy; it was characterised variously as the episode's \\"secret weapon\\", \\"very fitting\\", \\"suitably macabre\\", and \\"fantastically nasty\\". For Hughes, it \\"was a lovely sting in the tale, and one of which Dahl would almost certainly have approved\\". Two reviews in The Times, however‚Äîone unsigned, and one by Matt Rudd‚Äîwere more critical. The unsigned review advised viewers to switch off before the end, as \\"the fabulous styling gives way to a gratuitously nasty conclusion, a bad misjudgment from such a talented writing team\\". For Rudd, the shocking ending served no purpose; critical of \\"shocking for the sake of shocking\\", he argued that the episode's \\"half-hour of self-satisfied 1970s pastiche followed by a frenzied knife attack is very unpleasant indeed\\". In i, an unsigned review of \\"The Bill\\"‚Äîthe second episode of the third series‚Äîsuggested that viewers may have been put off the programme by the \\"rather nasty final couple of minutes\\" of \\"The Devil of Christmas\\". Though Jackson considered the ending \\"overwrought\\", he felt that it \\"pulled the rug\\"; \\"turning on a sixpence, the screams of 'Kathy' turned truly horrifying; the tackiness suddenly real and disturbing\\". Mellor considered the ending \\"a terrific twist as long as you didn‚Äôt look at it too closely\\", arguing that the interviewer's patience and the crew's collusion were unlikely. However, she suggested, there is little to be gained by criticising these aspects of the episode. For Baylis, the ending was unexpected, revealing \\"darkness of the shabby human kind\\". In the closing seconds of the episode, he said, \\"we suddenly saw it all, without seeing anything\\".

They have been designated a scheduled ancient monument. Discovery These carvings or petroglyphs were first recorded in 1986 (although a '1751' carved date suggests an earlier discovery) when the Kingencleugh Estate decided to clear an area of vegetation along the north side of the Liddell Burn that is a minor tributary stream of the River Ayr in an area famous for its quarrying of red sandstone. The removal of vegetation exposed the carvings that are distributed across two faces of a vertical outcrop of rock and they were reported to the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock. The presence of possible medieval carvings, the extensive quarrying with numerous workmen employed in the area, especially during the construction of the Ballochmyle Viaduct, emphasises how surprising it is that these glyphs were overlooked for so long, especially as they are only about 2 km south-east of Mauchline's town centre. Description The rock here is described as being a \\"pink dessert sandstone from the Permian age showing clear signs of dune bedding\\". The cup and ring marks are composed of two 'panels' with several hundred 'cup and ring' and other glyphs or carvings in a range of styles, ranging from single shallow cups through to deeper cups with multiple rings. Less common, but unique in the Scottish context are ‚Äòsquare with cup‚Äô carvings; ‚Äòringed stars‚Äô are also present. Three deer-like carvings and some other inscriptions with Lombardic style letters were also carved into the rockface and these are thought to be medieval in date. Several feet of soil were removed from the bottom of the corner that divides the two main halves of the site and this uncovered three 'trilithon-like' carvings and others may await discovery where the soil has not been removed. The carvings were protected by the vegetation and began to deteriorate after this was removed and in addition vandalism and theft of a panel has taken place. It is likely that they were historically hidden from direct view by trees and shrubs. The Ballochmyle glyphs or motifs are carved on red sandstone, however they are found elsewhere on other sedimentary rocks such as Millstone Grits, as well as the harder igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granites and schists. File:Ballochmyle Cup and Ring marked stone - 1.JPG  Concentric circles and cups. File:Ballochmyle Cup and Ring marked stone - 5.JPG An area where 'cups' dominate. File:Cup marks at Mauchline, Scotland.JPG  It is unusual to find these glyphs on a vertical rock face. File:Concentric ring and cup carvings, Mauchline, Scotland.JPG  Some have channels running down from them. File:Cup and Ring Marks at Mauchline, Scotland.JPG  Natural fissures, etc. may have been incorporated into the design. File:Ballochmyle Quarry.JPG Extensive quarrying took place at Ballochmyle and many glyphs may have been destroyed. The basic 'cup' is the most common carving however a wide range of glyphs exist with single to multiple concentric circles that are sometimes cut through in various ways by channels, etc. Where concentric rings exist the central cup often appears to dominate in depth and size suggesting that they were subject to repeated reworking over a period of time. Some incomplete or poorly formed glyphs exist here suggesting that different persons were involved in making them and frequent overlays of existing glyphs with either 'cups' or 'cup rings' suggests that they were created over an extended period of time. Studies suggest that distinct stylistic groupings may be present with one panel area having simple cups and cups with grooves, whilst another area has predominately bold cups with multiple concentric rings. An area with an apparent Lombardic style lettering may read 'ASAID' with two or three unreadable leading letters and a likely lost section. The final element is a date '1751' that is considered authentic but did not lead to further recorded investigation. Evidence suggests that cup and ring art was created from the Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC. Creation and meaning Ballochmyle Bridge and gorge. Cup and ring mark stones are frequently found throughout Britain, with over 2500 sites in England alone, however an unusual feature of those at Ballochmyle is that they have been carved on nearly or actual vertical surfaces rather than horizontal and often 'altar-like' exposed stone outcrops. These types of carvings were created using 'hammerstones' or 'peckers', examples of these have been found elsewhere, hitting the surface of the rock repeatedly or using a grinding motion until the desired design was formed Some of the long grooves appear to be a series of cups that were then joined together. The soft nature of the stone at Ballochmyle gives insights into how the glyphs were created with many small holes that could not have been formed by a hammering action. The contrast with the original rock surface and the effect of shadow and rain usually makes the markings stand out however hints of the use of coloured pigments have been found at other sites and such things as animal fat, charcoal, plants dyes, etc. could have been used during various types of ceremonies to enhance the glyphs or as part of their cultural use. The frequency and widespread use of the same glyphs or motifs indicates that they had definite interpretive meanings and significance to the cultures that created them and these developed and then persisted over thousands of years. The locations indicate that these carvings were mostly for public display and not usually intended as part of secret practices where the fact that they were hidden was important. It may be relevant that the Ballochmyle area has both spectacular geological formations and geographical features in addition to the presence of a significant liminal zone in the form of a major watercourse, the River Ayr. Carvings into rocks can have deeper meanings such as with the carved footprint Petrosomatoglyphs at Dunadd in Argyll, linking a person literally to the land. The concept of the Anima locus is pertinent here, that is the 'soul' of a place, its essential personality as perceived in the imagination and emotions of visitors. A concept linked to the belief in supernatural spirits of nature as residing in stones, springs, mountains, islands, trees, etc. A form of religious significance linked to life and death, past and present, real and spiritual worlds, etc. has been proposed. A significant factor is that, as previously stated, they were created from Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC and they ceased when the Celtic Culture began to dominate and suppress older cultural practices. During this time smaller nomadic groups that might visit certain sites seasonally developed into sedentary communities with hierarchical leadership structures and specific communal religious practices. A facsimile of an unusual cup and ring mark stone from Dalgarven, North Ayrshire A cup and ring mark stone from Sardinia Many 'galleries' of cup and ring mark art are in prominent places within the landscape, such as river gorges, waterfalls, outcrops, caves, etc. and it has been suggested that they may have defined territorial boundaries, either for a locality or for a significant land holding. Few prehistoric track ways have been positively identified however some link with the more practical aspects of Ley lines may be indicated by the observation that cup and ring art is sometimes found overlooking natural harbours, on prominent natural landscape features, in mountain passes, along valley sides, at the entrances to inland routes, etc. It is thought that natural features of the rock faces may influence the cup and ring mark sizes, distribution and type in addition to 'framing' the carvings. Fissures, grooves, wind erosion marks, cracks, dune bedding, etc. may all have been regarded by the Cup and ring mark carvers as significant and meaningful in their own right to be copied, enhanced, removed or incorporated as possibly the work of their 'ancestors' or even the works of the gods themselves. Some cup and ring mark panels may have only been used seasonally and the varying level of complexity at sites has been interpreted as being both more and less significant in terms of the level of meaning present. The universality of cup and ring markings suggest a commonality of the origins of such glyphs that may relate to natural phenomena that are deemed significant, such as the concentricles that form on water when an object or offering is placed in it and although this may have been interpreted differently by the many cultures involved, the liminality with associated themes of thresholds and communication with the 'other side' may be one explanation for the use of cup and rings rather than the extensive use of glyphs such as ovals, boxes, triangles, star-shapes, etc. Surveys of the markings In 2015 AOC Archaeology group were employed by the Forestry Commission Scotland to carry out a survey of laser scanning and photogrammetry on the Ballochmyle cup and ring marks. Laser scanning recorded the glyphs in 3D in minute detail, taking millions of measurements. The Photogrammetry involved photographing the site from many different angles and then bringing the data together to create a 3D model. The RCAHMS carried out a survey on behalf of Historic Scotland in 1987 and a series of drawings were lodged with what is now Historic Environment Scotland.

The bastion of Santo Domingo has a particular importance, since it is the origin of the construction of the city walls of Cartagena de Indias in the early 17th century. This work of fortification was conceived around 1602 by the engineer Battista Antonelli and his nephew Crist√≥bal de Roda, also engineer, who decided to build it on the avenue through which the pirate Francis Drake had penetrated, in 1586. The city did not have stone barracks, and its few defenders, placed in an improvised trench in the strait of the isthmus that separated Bocagrande from the city, just where Avenida Santander is nowadays, could not face the invader. From this episode is a curious document written in Latin and signed by Drake, where he acknowledged receipt of the formidable rescue that the authorities were forced to pay, and a few years later, the decision to close the avenue of Bocagrande with the bastion of Santo Domingo . Therefore, the bastion protected the access to the city from the peninsula of Bocagrande, constituting itself in the first one of the great bastions of the walls of Cartagena. This bastion is model of the proportions regulated by the Italian school of fortification. In its collar the low squares are opened, that is to say, the lower parts of the esplanade of the bastion, where in the 16th and 17th centuries it was customary to locate the cannons. At the beginning of the 18th century, during the considerable reforms of Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor, the lower squares disappeared, but the vaults that served as access remained on both sides of the ramp. From that same period they must date the canals, which carry the waters from the most hidden cracks of the bastion to the public cistern. Herrera also added the large watchtower, which crowns the main angle of the bastion and which points to the sea. Don Juan de Herrera also moved the gate puerta de San Felipe from the left side to the opposite flank of the bastion, where it can still walk quietly. This bastion was also known by the name of San Felipe and Santa Mar√≠a, but it was the name of the gate puerta de Santo Domingo, also contiguous to the bastion, which gave it the name it carries until today.

A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the last of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the first of two in two months, the last was on May 4 which covered a part of the Northern Hemisphere. It was part of solar saros 150. Description The eclipse was visible in much of Antarctica with the exception of most of the northern and northeastern parts, it included most of southern South America, the South Zetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands. The edge of the eclipse included Paraguay (parts are now in Argentina) and southern Brazil. The eclipse started at sunrise in Chile south of Antofagasta and finished at sunset in Antarctica. It showed about up to 10% obscurity in the South Pole area and in Uruguay, 20 to 35% at the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia. The greatest eclipse was in Antarctica at 61.9 S, 110.5 W at 11:19 UTC (4:19 AM local time). The subsolar marking was west of Angola in Africa.

They are known for their depressive doom style.  Name  Wasara in old Finnish orthography means ‚ÄòHammer‚Äô. The modern spelling is Vasara.  History  Antti √Östr√∂m, Ipi Kiiskinen and Mikko Nevanlahti were childhood friends in the town of Lohja in Southern Finland, and in 1996 they decided to form a band. The band was formed as Ali Baba and took influences from a range of musical genres including punk and rock. In 1999 the band changed its name to Wasara and Sami Tikkanen was added on guitars. Two demos were released on CD between 2000 and 2002. The first of these; Sinulle did not create the type of sound that the band were looking for. The second, a self-titled work was more successful and secured a two album deal with Firebox Records. Their first album Kaiken Kauniin Loppu was released in 2003. Mikko Nevanlahti left shortly afterwards and was replaced by Tuukka Heikurinen on drums. Before the release of the second album Meist√§ On Maa T√§ysi in 2005 Harri-Lempinen had taken over on drums. The second album was released on Roihu Records, which was a division of Firebox. A further change with Saku Lempinen replacing Sami Tikkanen on guitars took place in 2008. The third album Hehku was released in 2011. The band reportedly split in early 2012 however by 2014 they were back together playing live gigs. They remained active until at least March 2016, but there has been no new recording.  Musical style  Lyrically Wasara focus on the subjects of despair, sorrow and pain. Suicide is a common issue in their lyrics. At times the harsh lyrical style is that of Death Metal. However the songs are produced at a mid-tempo with some folk elements and may also be described as Groove Metal. Their music has been defined as 90s Heavy Rock rather than Metal. It has also been compared with early Amorphis. Although melancholy is a common thread, their albums offer variation in style and pace, with clean and harsh vocals used. = Current lineup = * Antti √Östr√∂m ‚Äì vocals, guitar, lyricist (1996-) * Ipi Kiiskinen‚Äì Bass_guitar (1996-) * Tuomo Tolonen ‚Äì guitar (2001-) * Harri Lempinen ‚Äì drums (2004-) * Saku Lempinen ‚Äì guitar (2008-) * Tipi Vainio ‚Äì Keyboards (2014-) = Past members = * Sami Tikkanen ‚Äì guitar (1999-2008) * Mikko Nevanlahti ‚Äì drums (1996‚Äì2003) * Tuukka Heikuriseen ‚Äì drums (2003-2004)  Discography  =Demos= * Sinulle (2000) Not on label * Wasara (2002) Not on label =Albums= * Kaiken Kauniin Loppu (All in a Beautiful End) (2003) * Meist√§ On Maa T√§ysi (2005) * Hehku (The Glow) (2011) =Singles= * Kivisade (Stone Rain) - CD Single (2003) * Manan Maille - Digital (2005) * Kuollut On Kuollut - Digital (2011)  External links  * https://www.facebook.com/pg/wasaraband/about/?ref=page_internal * http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Wasara/14820 * https://www.discogs.com/artist/708822-Wasara References Finnish rock music groups ","title":"Wasara"},{"id":"53476535","text":"}}} The tangent-secant theorem describes the relation of line segments created by a secant and a tangent line with the associated circle.

He is known for his research group's work in total synthesis projects, particularly asymmetric synthesis of complex natural products. Early life and education Carreira was born in 1963 in Havana, Cuba. He received his B.S. in 1984 from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he worked with Scott E. Denmark. He then began graduate work at Harvard University as a student of David A. Evans and received his Ph.D. in 1990. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology with Peter Dervan until he joined the faculty there in 1992. Academic career Carreira began his independent research career on the Caltech faculty and became a full professor in 1997. While there, he received several awards for successful new faculty and for his skilled teaching. He has been a full professor of chemistry at ETH Z√ºrich since 1998. Carreira has coauthored and coedited several major reference works in the total synthesis field, including volume 93 of Organic Syntheses. In 2019, Carreira was appointed as the editor-in- chief of Organic Letters published by the American Chemical Society, where he had previously served as an associate editor for 18 years. In April 2020, Carreira was elected for a membership in the National Academy of Science of the United States. In September, he was appointed chief editor of the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Carreira is the first Hispanic American scientist to hold the position. Research Research in Carreira's group focuses on total synthesis, particularly asymmetric (that is, enantioselective) synthesis of complex natural products. The group also works on applications of these methods to development of catalysts and to medicinal chemistry.

The original version of \\"Shine\\" was released three years earlier on her EP Shine, although it has been re-worked for this album. It was intended to be the lead for her initially planned second album, but the plans fell through after a dispute with her label. After Nalick separated from her label, she got married and took a two year break from the music industry. In 2010, Nalick announced her return to the music business on her Facebook page. She formed her own independent label, Nyctograph, and released Broken Doll & Odds & Ends. The title track of the album, \\"Broken Doll\\", was developed after she found her old Barbie dolls discarded and broken. The song develops this as a theme of once feeling special, but then being left behind. The song was written early in the process, when Nalick was still under contract with Sony Music. One of the themes the album explores is the discomfort Nalick felt at being asked to be somebody different than herself. Initially, the album was intended to be an acoustic album, but Nalick's friends who performed on the album had talent with many instruments, so that she gave them the opportunity to explore a variety of sounds to put on the album, so that various instruments like the sitar, the mandocello, and the glockenspiel ended up on the album.

Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Verse 2 : Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, :: or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest? * \\"Son of man\\" (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ü÷æ◊ê◊ì◊ù -): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. Verse 6 : Therefore thus saith the Lord God; : As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, :: which I have given to the fire for fuel, : so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Application of the figure to Jerusalem. * \\"Fuel\\" (Hebrew: ◊ê÷∏◊õ÷∞◊ú÷∏◊î ; 'ok-lah): the Hebrew word actually means \\"food\\" as in \\"food of wild beast\\", but also used as \\"food of fire\\", that is \\"to be consumed by fire.\\" The wood of the vine is worthy only when it produces grapes, otherwise it is useless, so it is thrown to the fire ().The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version, Indexed.

It is one of the few places worldwide that share an identical name with London's famous Downing Street, where the official residence of the British prime minister is located. Created in the late 19th century, the Straits Settlements government built an administrative complex along the street. Thus, as is the case in London, Downing Street in George Town was once the seat of government in Penang.  History  The only surviving portion of the Straits Settlements-built Government Offices has since been converted into the Penang Islamic Council offices. HSBC Penang headquarters, completed in 1951, replaces the older HSBC Building which was obliterated during World War II. Originally, the area where Downing Street now runs through does not exist; the sea reached all the way up to Beach Street, making the latter the eastern coastal road of George Town. This particular area was created through a massive land reclamation project in the 1880s, which also created Weld Quay and expanded the harbour facilities required for the booming entrep√¥t trade at the time. Downing Street was envisioned as part of George Town's civic precinct, and between 1889 and 1907, the government of the Straits Settlements constructed the U-shaped Government Offices along Downing Street. The Government Offices included the Resident Councillor's Office, the Audit Office, the Public Works Department and the Marine Department, as well as the Land Office in its western wing and a post office in the eastern wing. Other than the Government Offices, the British authorities also built other administrative buildings along Downing Street, such as the Education Department, the Treasury Office and the Indian Immigration Depot. This concentration of administrative functions effectively made Downing Street the administrative centre of the Straits Settlement of Penang. In 1906, the original HSBC Building at the junction with Beach Street was completed. However, most of this colonial architecture were destroyed during World War II. Japanese and Allied bombers repeatedly attacked this particular location due to its importance as Penang's administrative heart, causing the almost total destruction of the Government Offices. The other administrative buildings and the HSBC Building were completely destroyed by the end of the war. Only one part of the Government Offices remain standing to this day. This section of the former Government Offices now houses the Penang Islamic Council offices. The present HSBC Building was also rebuilt and completed in 1951.

Lucius Afranius and Titus Quinctius Atta are known to have written fabulas togatas. It is also treated as an expression that functioned as the overall description of all Roman types of drama in accordance with a distinction between Roman toga and Greek pallium. There are recorded sources that cite how this drama could be obscene and moralistic. By mid-second century BCE the fabula togata become one of the two types of drama that constituted a bifurcated Roman comedy along with fabula palliata. The fabula togata was distinguished from the palliata primarily by its use of Roman or Italian characters, transferring the comic situations of the bourgeois palliata to the lower-class citizens of the country towns of Italy. The palliata was based on originals of Greek New Comedy, tragedies from Attic sources as well as the grand dramatization of Rome's past. There is no existing complete fabula togata but there are surviving fragments that indicate aspects of the creative practice.

In 2019-20, he was the University of Pennsylvania's Inaugural Provost's Distinguished Visiting Faculty Fellow. He is also the editor for Lexington Books' \\"Philosophy of Race\\" book series. He is known for his work in critical whiteness studies, critical philosophy of race, critical phenomenology (especially racial embodiment), and African American philosophy, and has written, edited, or co-edited more than 20 books. He has also authored over 150 scholarly articles and chapters. Yancy has also authored numerous influential essays and conducted provocative interviews at The New York Times' philosophy column \\"The Stone.\\" Yancy has been interviewed on various radio stations throughout the U.S. He has also appeared in two documentaries, Lillian Smith: Breaking the Silence, an independent documentary directed by Hal Jacobs and Henry Jacobs, with support from Georgia Humanities, 2019, and Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story, a six-episode series released on July 30, 2018 on Paramount Network. Series was directed by Jenner Furts and Julia Willoughby Nason. Executive producers: Sybrina Fulton, Tracy Martin, Jay-Z, Chachi Senior, Michael Gasparro, Jenner Furst, Julia Willoughby Nason, and Nick Sandow. Education and career Yancy received his B.A. in philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh cum laude in 1985, his M.A. in philosophy from Yale University in 1987, his M.A. in Africana studies from New York University (NYU) in 2004, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Duquesne University with distinction in 2005. He began teaching at Duquesne in 2005, progressing from assistant professor to full professor in just eight years, 2005-2013. After teaching at Duquesne for ten years, he moved to teach philosophy at Emory University in 2015. At the University of Pittsburgh, Yancy wrote his undergraduate honors thesis on Bertrand Russell's Sense Data theory. His honors thesis was directed by prominent American philosopher and epistemologist Wilfrid Sellars. Also at Pitt, he studied Kant under Nicholas Rescher, studied with Adolf Grunbaum on Freud's theory of religion, studied Martin Heidegger under John Haugeland, ancient Greek philosophy under Alexander Nehamas, and modern philosophy under Annette Baier. \\"Dear White America\\" In 2015, Yancy published an article in the New York Times' philosophy column, The Stone, entitled \\"Dear White America\\", which proved very controversial and resulted in his receiving large amounts of hate mail and harassment. This experience later helped convince the American Philosophical Association to issue a statement denouncing bullying and harassment. It also resulted in his being added to the Professor Watchlist, a website which purports to document anti-conservative college professors, in 2016. Anne Leighton was also instrumental in bringing attention and support through creating a petition in support of Yancy. Also, 68 philosophers and intellectuals wrote a letter in his defense. In response to being placed on the Professor Watchlist, Yancy wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times entitled \\"I am a Dangerous Professor.\\" Works =Books= * Across Black Spaces: Essays and Interviews from an American Philosopher.

Overview According to this law, the current decays according to a power law: : Ileft(tright) propto t^{-n}, where Ileft(tright) is the current at a given charging time, t, and n is the decay constant such that 0. Given that the dielectric has a finite conductance, the equation for current measured through a dielectric under a DC electrical field is: : Ileft(tright) = at^{b} + c, where a is a constant of proportionality, b is the decay constant (i.e., b=-n), and c is the intrinsic conductance of the dielectric. This stands in contrast to the Debye formulation, which states that the current is proportional an exponential function with a time constant, tau, according to: : Ileft(tright) propto expleft{-t/ tauright} . The Curie‚Äìvon Schweidler behavior has been observed in many instances such as those shown by Andrzej Ka Johnscher and Jameson et al. It has been interpreted as a many-body problem by Jonscher, but can also be formulated as an infinite number of resistor-capacitor circuits. This comes from the fact that the power law can be expressed as: : t^{-n} = frac{1}{Gammaleft(nright)} int_0^infty tau^{-left(n+1right)} e^{-t/ tau} dtau, where Gammaleft(nright) is the Gamma function.

Characters *Thyestis umbra (Thyestes' ghost), uncle of Agamemnon *chorus *Clytemnestra, wife of Agamemnon *nutrix (nurse) *Aegisthus, son of Thyestes, lover of Clytemnestra *Eurybates, messenger of Agamemnon. *Cassandra, Trojan princess, captive of Agamemnon *Agamemnon, king of Myceneae, and leader of the Greeks in the Trojan War. *Electra, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra *Strophius, king of Phocis, husband of Agamemnon's sister *Orestes (silent role), son of Agamemnon, brother of Electra *Pylades (silent role), son of Strophius, friend of Orestes The scene is laid partly inside and partly outside the palace of Agamemnon at Argos or Mycenae, on the day of the return of the king from his long absence at Troy, beginning in the period of darkness just preceding the dawn. Plot The blood-feud between Atreus and Thyestes was not ended with the vengeance which Atreus wreaked upon his brother. It was fated that Thyestes should live to father upon his own daughter a son, Aegisthus, who would slay Atreus and bring ruin and death upon Agamemnon. The Trojan War is done, and now the near approach of the victorious king Agamemnon, bringing his captives and treasure home to Argos, has been announced. But his wife Clytemnestra, enraged at Agamemnon because he had sacrificed her daughter Iphigenia at Aulis to appease the winds, and full of jealousy because he brings Cassandra as her rival home, estranged also by the long-continued absence of her husband, but most estranged by her own guilty affair with Aegisthus, is now plotting to slay her husband on his return, gaining both revenge and safety from his anger. =Act I= The ghost of Thyestes, arriving from the underworld, calls upon his son Aegisthus to carry out the revenge which had been promised him by the oracle. The Chorus of the Women of Argos or Mycenae complains of exalted fortune as unstable, full of anxieties and cares, and therefore gives preference to a modest life. =Act II= Clytemnestra, conscious of her own wickedness, and fearing punishment for her adultery now that her husband has just returned, meditates the destruction of Agamemnon as a remedy. The Nurse however, dissuades her from adopting such a step. Aegisthus comes on the scene and finds Clytemnestra in a hesitating mood and prepared to yield to the wise counsels of the Nurse. He succeeds in diverting Clytemnestra from her new-born resolution, and on again towards her rash purpose. The chorus of the women of Mycenae and Argos sing a triumphal hymn in honor of Apollo on account of the victory gained at Troy, but introduce laudatory addresses to Juno, Minerva and Jupiter. =Act III= Eurybates reports that Agamemnon has returned and is now approaching‚Äîthat a tempest was visited upon them by Pallas, which was made worse for them, through the treachery of Nauplius. Sacrifices are prepared for the gods, and a feast is got ready for Agamemnon. The captives are brought forward. The Chorus of Trojans bewail the fates and the misfortunes of Troy. Cassandra is seized with one of her prophesying fits, and foretells what dangers are threatening Agamemnon. =Act IV= Cassandra, when Agamemnon returns, predicts his fate, but she is not believed. The Chorus of Argos Women sing the praises of Hercules, especially as he was brought up at Argos, and they maintain that his arrows were required by the Fates, for the second downfall of Troy. =Act V= Cassandra, although she (actually) sees nothing, and is only in the proscenium, foretells what is to happen, and she narrates everything that is progressing in the banqueting hall to those outside concerning the slaughter of Agamemnon. Electra persuades her brother Orestes to take flight and luckily encounters Strophius. She hands Orestes over to Strophius to be carried away. Electra flies to the altar for protection. Clytemnestra orders Electra to be dragged away from the altar and thrown into prison. Clytemnestra orders death for Cassandra. Sources There is no earlier known play which serves as an obvious model for Seneca's Agamemnon. The play tells the roughly same story as the Agamemnon by Aeschylus. However the characterisation, structure, and themes of Seneca's play are very different from Aeschylus's play. Agamemnon has only a relatively minor role in Seneca's play, compared with Clytemnestra and Cassandra who have large parts. Other (lost) plays which might have influenced Seneca include Agamemnon by Ion of Chios, Aegithus by Livius Andronicus, and Clytemnestra by Accius.

Commanded by General Johann Pflugbeil, the unit was deployed in German-occupied areas of the Soviet Union, in the Army Group Centre Rear Area, for security and Bandenbek√§mpfung (\\"anti-bandit\\") duties. It was responsible for large-scale war crimes and atrocities including the deaths of thousands of Soviet civilians. Operational history =Formation and Operation Barbarossa= The division was formed in June 1941. Along with Wehrmacht army troops, it included Police Battalion 309 of the Orpo (uniformed police), its only motorised formation. The unit spent three months at the front and six months on rear-area security duties in the Gomel area. Its duties included ensuring the security of communications and supply lines, economic exploitation and combatting partisans in the Wehrmacht's rear areas. In September 1941, the officers of the division attended the Mogilev conference, organised by General Max von Schenckendorff, commander of Army Group Centre Rear Area. The conference, while ostensibly on \\"anti-partisan training\\", resulted in a dramatic increase in atrocities against Jews and other civilians in the last three months of 1941. The division reported shooting 1,847 \\"partisans\\" in two months alone. Hostage-taking also increased dramatically. Wehrmacht units were receiving directives that 50 to 100 \\"communists\\" were to be killed as atonement for the death of each German soldier. =Activities in 1942= In March 1942, the division embarked on large-scale Nazi security warfare operations in the Yelnya-Dorogobuzh area east of Smolensk. The so-called anti-partisan operations in \\"bandit-infested\\" areas amounted to destruction of villages, seizure of livestock, deportation of the able-bodied population for slave labour to Germany and murder of those of non-working age. The tactics included shelling villages not under German control with heavy weapons, resulting in mass civilian casualties. General Johann Pflugbeil directed his troops that the \\"goal of the operation is not to drive the enemy back, but to exterminate him\\". During the operation, the unit recorded 278 German troops killed, while 806 enemies were reported killed in action and 120 prisoners were handed over to Wehrmacht's Secret Field Police for execution. Only 200 weapons (rifles, machine-guns and pistols) were seized. =Later history= The division saw brief front-line duty in October 1943 fighting the Soviet Red Army troops at Gomel. In November, it was again transferred to rear-security duties (Bandenbek√§mpfung) in Belarus. The unit was largely destroyed during the Soviet Red Army summer offensive, Operation Bagration, in June 1944. The surviving personnel were absorbed into other security units.

In addition to its architectural beauty, the Convento de Santo Domingo holds precious sacred objects, such as the Christ of Expiration. The chroniclers say that in 1754 an epidemic of smallpox spread, which could only be stopped after praying for nine days to this image, which is why this Christ is an object of special devotion for the Cartagenians. Legend of the origin The origin of the Christ of Expiration also has its miraculous chronicle. According to tradition, the novices found a piece of wood by the sea that they gathered with the idea of carving the image of Christ. Taking advantage of the fact that in those days spent an unknown carver in the Dominican convent, they decided to propose the idea to him. Asked the pilgrim carver, he said that the log was very short for the proposed work. Then the fathers returned the log to the sea. Days later the religious returned to the beach and found the same tree, but now it measured enough to carve the image. The artisan agreed to do the work, but asked not to be interrupted and to have the food delivered through a window of the room, where he locked himself up for several days. After a couple of weeks the religious stopped listening to the craftsman carving. Worried about this unusual silence, they decided to enter the room. There they found the image of Christ at the moment of expiration, but no trace of the craftsman. This led to the legend that it was an angel sent by God to make the venerated Christian image. This image was preserved for years in a Baroque style altar, that altar dating from 1807, and is the work of the Cartagenian artist Hermenegildo Jos√© de Ayala. Cristo de la Expiraci√≥n Day The Cristo de la Expiraci√≥n, whose devotion is expressed through prayers, songs and praises, is honored with the pilgrimages that September 14 are made to the temple of Santo Domingo, from where one of the most massive processions that take place in the Historic Center of Cartagena de Indias. The event begins with a tour of the main streets of the sector.

The victorious Greeks have gathered the rich spoils of Troy upon the shore, among these the Trojan women who await their lot to be assigned to their Greek lords and taken to the cities of their foes. But now the ghost of Achilles has risen from the tomb, and demanded that Polyxena be sacrificed to him before the Greeks shall be allowed to sail away. And Calchas, also, bids that Astyanax be slain, for only then can Greece be safe from any future Trojan war. =Act I= Hecuba laments with the Chorus of Trojans the destruction of their country and the death of Hector and Priam. =Act II= Talthybius relates that the Ghost of Achilles has appeared, and reproving the Greeks for their ingratitude, demanded that Polyxena, under the pretext of marriage with whom, he was slain, should be sacrificed at his tomb as an offering to the chthonic gods. Otherwise the Greeks will not have a favourable wind for their return. Agamemnon and Pyrrhus quarrel about the sacrifice. Calchas is summoned and he asserts that not only must Polyxena be slain, but Astynax must also be hurled from the tower. The Chorus denies that Achilles appeared as a spirit, and asserts that the soul dies forever with the body. =Act III= Andromache having taken alarm at a vision in her dream, hides away her son in his father's tomb. Ulysses in his cleverness discovers where he is, and drags him forth to meet his death. Andromache mingles curses and threats with her supplications entreating Ulysses, but not prevailing upon him. The Trojans, once allotted to the Greeks, are to be conveyed to various parts of Greece‚Äîsome to Sparta, some to Mycenae, some to Ithaca, and to the country of Helen, Agamemnon and Ulysses. =Act IV= The plan is discussed as to how the sacrifices to the chthonic gods and manes of Achilles are to be conducted; and in what garments, Polyxena, who is to be sacrificed under the impression of a real marriage, is to be arrayed. Also what part shall be played by Helen, in order that she may cajole Polyxena with the vain hope of marrying Pyrrhus: she at first, keeps up the pretence, but after a time dismisses the deception, having argued with Andromache, she confesses everything and openly recommends the fulfilment of the scheme. The Chorus derives consolation from the misfortune being shared by so many; \\"as if for the wretched to have companions in sorrow were a solace,\\" and then draws attention to the fact that the solace in question will lose its efficacy, as they will be separated by the allotting that has been going on. =Act V= The Messenger informs the mothers, Hecuba and Andromache, that Astyanax has been hurled from the tower and Polyxena slain at the tomb of Achilles. Reception Translator R. Scott Smith wrote that Seneca's attempt in the work to weave two episodes together \\"means that the play is somewhat dissociated ‚Äì a 'flaw' that critics have sometimes brought to bear against it\\", but stated that \\"in the place of unity, however, there is symmetry.\\" References Further reading * Elaine Fantham, Seneca‚Äôs Troades: A literary introduction with text, translation, and commentary.

Hercules being at that time away in the underworld, where he had gone to seek out Cerberus as the final labour assigned him by Eurystheus through Juno's hatred. Here he found Theseus, who had made a descent into the regions of Pluto in company of Pirithous with the intention of carrying off Proserpine. Lycus seized his opportunity, and aided by conspirators, slayed Creon together with his two sons, and usurped the Kingdom of Thebes. =Act I= Juno vents her anger at the love affairs of Jupiter, his concubines and bastard offspring, and is very angry about the successes of Hercules, and so on his return from the underworld will be thrown by Juno into a state of mad frenzy. The Chorus of Thebans beginning with a description of the dawn of day alludes to the customs of the times, condemning the pursuits and undertakings of the nobles. They reprove Hercules for his audacity in the attempting of his various labors, and finally extol and sigh for the tranquillity which is only to be found in leading a retired life. =Act II= Megara bewails the absence of Hercules, and complains of the violence and insolence of Lycus. Amphitryon pities the despondent state of Megara's mind, and tenders his consolation. Lycus, having slain Creon and his sons, has established himself on the throne and governs the kingdom. He seeks to marry Megara, using every stratagem, and threatens violence in case she refuses. =Act III= Hercules asks for the pardon of Phoebus and the rest of the Gods, that although having been commanded, he had dragged Cerberus from the underworld to the regions above. Hercules having returned from the underworld with Theseus encounters Amphitryon who greets him and informs him about events. Hercules goes off to kill Lycus. Theseus provides Amphitryon with an account of the underworld and the deeds of Hercules. The Chorus sings of the victory of Hercules gained in the underworld, and praises the hero. =Act IV= Hercules having returned after the slaughter of Lycus, as he is about to offer sacrifices to the Gods whom he has invoked, becomes mad and under the influence of his madness, he kills his wife and children, and then falls into a deep sleep! =Act V= Hercules wakes, with his mind restored, and learns that he has killed his own children. He prepares to kill himself, but prevailed on, by the appeals of Amphitryon and Theseus, he refrains from suicide, and at the suggestion of Theseus, he starts for Athens, to undergo the ordeal of atonement for his mad acts.

In the 1960s, Rotondo did little live performing, but played frequently on radio broadcasts with Gato Barbieri, Franco D'Andrea, Pierre Favre, and Mal Waldron. He continued working with D'Andrea through the early 1970s. He was less active in the 1980s and 1990s. References *\\"Nunzio Rotondo\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed.

It tells the story of Hercules' betrayal by his jealous wife, Deianira, followed by his death and apotheosis. The general opinion is that the play is not Seneca's, but was written in close imitation. Authorship The play was first rejected by Daniel Heinsius in the 17th century, It is worth noting that Heinsius also rejected Seneca's Phoenissae, and he ascribed Hercules Furens, Thyestes, Oedipus, and Agamemnon, to Seneca's father. and the majority of modern critics agree that the play in its present form is not by Seneca. The work has many small differences in style from Seneca's other plays which \\"suggest a fundamentally different approach to playwriting\\". It is also around twice as long as Seneca's other plays, and is in fact the longest drama to survive from antiquity. Hercules Oetaeus contains numerous passages from Seneca's other plays which have been lifted out of context, reworked, and inserted into the play. The play's conclusion contains a strong Stoic theme which is not found in Seneca's other plays. However, there are still scholars who defend the play as authentic (albeit hastily written), or argue that a later hand reworked an incomplete fragment. Critics in favour of this view argue that the first third of the play (lines 1‚Äì705) could have originally been written by Seneca but that the end of the play is not his. Characters *Hercules, Son of Jupiter and Alcmena *Iole, Daughter of Eurytus, king of Oechalia *nutrix (nurse) *Deianeira, Daughter of Oeneus, king of Aetolia, and wife of Hercules *Hyllus, Son of Hercules and Deianira *Alcmena, Daughter of Electryon, king of Mycenae *Philoctetes, A prince of Thessaly, and friend of Hercules *Lichas (silent role) The messenger of Deianira to Hercules *Chorus, of Aetolian women, faithful to Deianira. *Band, of Oechalian women, suffering captivity in company with Iole. Plot The long, heroic life of Hercules has neared its end. His twelve great tasks, assigned him by Eurystheus through Juno's hatred, have been done. His latest victory was over Eurytus, king of Oechalia. Hercules slew the king and overthrew his house, because he would not give Hercules his daughter Iole in marriage. And now the hero, having overcome the world, and Pluto's realm beneath the earth, aspires to heaven. He sacrifices to Cenaean Jove, and prays at last to be received into his proper home. =Act I= The first scene, with the chorus following, is at Euboea, where Hercules, about to offer sacrifices on the promontory of Cenaeum, records his wishes for a place in the heavens, which he recounts and boasts he has deserved. (The rest of the Tragedy takes place at Trachis.) Iole joining in with the Chorus of Oechalians, bewails the destruction of her country, the slaughter of her father and kinsfolk and lastly, her own position of servitude. =Act II= Deianira, furious with jealousy having seen Iole, debates revenge with her nurse. She decides to send a garment to Hercules anointed with the blood of the centaur Nessus. She believes that it will act as love charm, but mentions how Nessus told her that the charm must be kept in darkness. The Chorus of Aetolian women bewail the lot of Deianira, they express their dislike of ambition, avarice, luxury and other frivolous pursuits of mankind, and praise the inferior conditions of life. =Act III= Deianira repents of her plan when she is acquainted with what danger the poison has brought about, and the calamity, as predicted from its exposure to the sun, has now taken place. Having learned about this from Hyllus, Deianira resolves to kill herself. The Chorus sings of everything as being subject to Death, regarding the failing strength of Hercules‚Äî \\"that nothing born or created is lasting,\\" which sentiment of Orpheus it praises, and they intersperse the Chorus with celebrating his divine art. =Act IV= Hercules complains about suffering undeservedly, and that he should be doomed to die an ignominious death, especially one arising out of a woman's treachery. Alcmena consoles Hercules, whilst lamenting his sad fate. Hyllus having returned, tells Hercules that Deianira, after she found that she had been deceived by Nessus, killed herself. The Chorus beseeches Phoebus to announce to all the world the death of Hercules: they predict the apotheosis of Hercules, and implore Jupiter, that there may be no more Tyrants, wild beasts or monsters, brought forth in the future, if so, that another Hercules may be forthcoming, as the avenger of such calamities. =Act V= Philoctetes announces the death and the last disposal of the body of Hercules. Alcmena grieves about her own downfall, arising out of the death of Hercules. Alcmena, in her grief, chants a funeral dirge. Hercules, having been raised to the companionship of the gods, consoles his grieving mother, being introduced into this scene by being lowered from the heavens above. The chorus breathes its thanks for the Apotheosis of Hercules, and is ready to worship the new Deity. Sources The first four acts follow the basic structure of Sophocles' play the Women of Trachis. However the scenes which describe Hercules's self- immolation and apotheosis at the end may be derived from Ovid's Metamorphoses (ix. 229-272).

The mosaic was originally constructed for an upscale villa in Daphne, just outside of Antioch. The mosaic was discovered during an archeological expedition which lasted between 1932 and 1939. It is currently the largest Antioch mosaic located within the United States. It measures approximately 20.5 feet x 23.3 feet.  History  Mosaics were an important form of Byzantine art and many examples were produced between the 6th and the 15th century AD.Kitzinger, Ernest. (1995) ‚ÄúByzantine Art in the Making: Main lines of Stylistic Development in Mediterranean Art, 3rd to 7th Century‚Äù Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Worcester Hunt is a well-preserved example of sixth century Byzantine mosaics. Most large-scale works of Byzantine art during this period were commissioned by the Orthodox Church or wealthy patrons of the elite upper classes.Kitzinger, Ernest. Mosaics were a significant development during the sixth century and were commonly used to adorn the interior floors and walls of church buildings as a display of religious fervor and political authority. Located in the southwestern corner of Anatolia along the Mediterranean coastline, Daphne was an ancient resort community situated in the hills overlooking the Seleucid city of Antioch, which the Byzantines had inherited from the Roman Empire. Antioch was a strategically important city and sat upon the confluences of significant trade routes.Downey, Glanville. (1961) ‚ÄúA History of Antioch in Syria: From Seleucus to the Arab Conquests‚Äù. Princeton University Press. Princeton, New Jersey. The political and cultural significance of Antioch and its surrounding areas was displayed through grand artistic works such as floor mosaics. From the 3rd century onwards, mosaics became a popular form of ornamentation among the wealthy elite. The Worcester Hunt was constructed in the early sixth century, likely during the reign of Justinian I. It is unique among other well-known Byzantine mosaics because it was not located in a place of worship, and it does not depict religious themes. Pre-Iconoclastic mosaics such as the Worcester Hunt are valuable sources of early Byzantine art because the political and social upheaval of the Iconoclasm resulted in the destruction of many artistic creations including mosaics.Von Grunebaum, G.E. (1962) Pp. 1-10 ‚ÄúByzantine Iconoclasm and the Influence of the Islamic Environment‚Äù. History of Religions. Vol. 2 No. 1, The University of Chicago The scale of the Worcester Hunt and the location in which it was constructed suggests that it was the private property of a wealthy Byzantine aristocrat. This mosaic would have been the centerpiece of a large residence, built for the purpose of leaving a lasting impression upon guests. The scale of the Worcester Hunt in comparison to other privately- owned Byzantine works of this period demonstrates the extensive time and funding that would have been required to create such a piece. The relatively well-preserved state of this large mosaic is also notable because this region experienced frequent earthquakes throughout the centuries. In 1268, the Mamluks of Egypt sacked the city of Antioch and most of the inhabitants were killed while others were enslaved.Downey, Glanville. The population of Antioch continued a gradual decline over the next few centuries until all that remained of the city were a series of uninhabited ruins. One of the dismounted hunters in the mosaic uses a spear to kill dangerous game. In 1931, the \\"Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity\\" was created by a coalition of archaeologists funded by Louvre Museum, Baltimore Museum of Art, Worcester Art Museum, Princeton University, and Harvard University. The expedition began in 1932, but archaeologists did not locate any major buildings as they had intended. They did however manage to uncover a great deal of mosaics in Antioch and the surrounding areas, including the ones found at Daphne.Cimok, Fatih. (2004) ‚ÄúAntioch Mosaics‚Äù Milet Publishing. Some of the discoveries remained in modern-day Turkey while others such as the Worcester Hunt were purchased by educational institutions. In 1936, Worcester Museum acquired the Worcester Hunt mosaic, where it remains today.  Description  The mosaic features multiple hunters, who are presumed to be members of the Byzantine aristocracy. Some are riding horses while others are stationary. At the center of the piece stands a single hunter who observes others as they use bows, spears, and swords to subdue large, dangerous game animals. The mosaic also depicts younger animals that are not the target of the hunters. This feature indicates that the hunters may have possessed an understanding of conservation and that their efforts were deliberately aimed at preventing the extinction of these animals. Some of these animals (most notably the tiger) would have been considered exotic game as they were not native to the region. This piece is an excellent example of secular Byzantine art as it lacks any significant religious iconography or allusions. Although faded to a degree, much of the vivid coloring in this piece remains easily visible.  Stylistic influences  A hunter on horseback uses a bow to subdue dangerous game. The region surrounding Antioch represented a crossroads between the Eastern and Western art forms in the late antiquity and early medieval periods. This blending of artistic styles is reflected in several ways when examining the Worcester Hunt. The figures are all arranged in a circular pattern around a central figure, which is a trademark feature of ancient Persian artwork. While the garments of the hunters appear to be of Greco-Roman origin, some of the weapons observed have a more eastern-inspired style. The mosaic contains a somewhat abstract depiction of humans while the animals appear to be more detailed, giving them a more realistic appearance. Many artists of this period sought to evoke classical elements in their work and this resulted in a tendency to incorporate classical Greco-Roman principles into Byzantine art.Mango, Cyril. (1963). ‚ÄúAntique Statuary and the Byzantine Beholder‚Äù. Vol. 17 Dumbarton Oaks Papers. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291190 The various thematic elements showcased in the mosaic demonstrate how the artist incorporated styles from multiple cultures when constructing this piece. Byzantine art fluctuated between naturalistic and abstract depictions depending on social and religious factors.Mango, Cyril (1963).

Valdambrini's professional career began in the late 1940s, when he played with Rex Stewart, and soon after co-led a small ensemble with Gianni Basso. Valdambrini's association with Basso would continue through the early 1960s. He also arranged and played as a sideman for Armando Trovajoli toward the end of the 1950s. In the 1960s he played with Gil Cuppini, Duke Ellington, and Giorgio Gaslini, and in the early 1970s worked with Maynard Ferguson. He joined forces again with Basso from 1972 to 1974, and played in the 1970s with Franco Ambrosetti, Conte Candoli, Dusko Goykovich, Freddie Hubbard, Mel Lewis, Frank Rosolino, Ernie Wilkins, and Kai Winding.

It is located between Cedar Street and Albany Street running along Washington Street, sharing a block with 90 West Street. It was built in 1931 and was designed by Renwick, Aspinwall & Guard. September 11 attacks When the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed on September 11, 2001, 130 Cedar Street was completely ravaged. Hundreds of tons of fiery debris rained down onto the building. The top of the building's northeast corner completely collapsed under the debris. A column section from WTC 2 penetrated the 10th floor roof slab. The projectile impacts also lit fires, which occurred primarily above the 9th floor. Fire damage was evident on the 11th and 12th floors in the northwest corner. The Amish Market located on the ground floor was completely destroyed and burned, later relocating further uptown. Several concrete columns were cracked, possibly from the impact. Several bays at the northeast corner were severely damaged from debris impact. After the attacks, the building was uninhabitable and lost all of its tenants.  Renovation  Like many buildings in the area, 130 Cedar Street had to be thoroughly decontaminated after the damage it sustained. In 2004, it was announced that the office building would be transformed into a hotel, despite rumors that the building would be demolished. After many years of revitalization, the building was finally reopened as a Club Quarters hotel. During the restoration process, seven new floors were added, making the building 19 stories tall.\\"Hotel Inventory Q4 2014\\" Alliance for Downtown New York References Financial District, Manhattan Skyscraper hotels in Manhattan Art Deco architecture in Manhattan Residential buildings completed in 1931 1931 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"130 Cedar Street"},{"id":"53477691","text":"Glenea oemeoides is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.
