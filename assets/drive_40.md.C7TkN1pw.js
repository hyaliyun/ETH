Kahn Term Endowed Professor of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of over eighty published scientific papers. Career Kim specializes in computational biology, genomics, and evolutionary biology. Originally from South Korea, he received his undergraduate degree in Microbiology at Seoul National University. During his undergraduate years, he became strongly interested in computer science and programming. He developed a program to fold tRNA sequences published in the Korean Journal of Biochemistry. This paper is now known as the first computational biology paper published in Korea. He received his PhD in Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University in 1992 under the supervision of Lev Ginzburg and Dan Dykhuizen. His dissertation was entitled \\"Factors influencing the growth of populations and their spatial distribution.\\" His post-doctoral research was with Margaret Kidwell at the University of Arizona working on molecular evolution of Drosophila species. In 1994, he became an assistant professor in the Department of Biology at Yale University and was promoted to a tenured position in 2000. In 2002 he moved to the University of Pennsylvania where he is currently the Edmund J. and Louise Kahn Term Endowed Professor in Biology, an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science, and the Co-Director of the Penn Genome Frontiers Institute. He has been on the Steering Committee and the Conference Chair for Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics; program chair and program committee for Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology; and he is the longest running Associate Editor for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Junhyong Kim's honors include the Sloan Foundation Young Investigator Award, Yale Faculty Award, Visiting Fellow at the Newton Institute (Cambridge University) and IHES (France), Ellison Medical Foundation Senior Scholar in Aging, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Kim has worked on a diverse set of research areas. His early works concentrated on mathematical phylogenetics, which started during his graduate school with Drs. Robert R. Sokal and F. James Rohlf who pioneered computational methods in evolutionary tree estimation. Among his works in this area, Junhyong Kim introduced the use of algebraic geometric techniques in phylogenetic estimation. In 1999, working with John Carlson at Yale, he developed a novel algorithm for computationally identifying G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCR) without using primary sequence homology, which led to the cloning of olfactory receptors in insects. After his move to Penn, his research has concentrated on comparative functional genomics, especially gene expression and RNA biology in two model systems. In one area, he is working with budding yeast to understand the mechanisms and evolution of timing control for gene expression. In the other area, he is working with Jim Eberwine to understand the RNA biology of mammalian neurons and the evolution of individual cell characteristics. With Dr. Eberwine he helped develop a novel method for using direct RNA transfer to reprogram mammalian cells and helped decipher the mechanisms of RNA localization in neurons. More recently, the Kim and Eberwine labs have been working together to understand transcriptome variability in single cells and how the variation relates to dysfunction of cells. Drs. Kim and Eberwine are currently directing a new 5-year project with a grant from the National Institutes of Health.

Through resources and media exposure, VoteRiders supports on-the- ground organizations that assist citizens to secure their voter IDs and galvanizes others to engage in these efforts. A national survey sponsored by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law in 2006 found that \\"[as] many as 11 percent of United States citizens - more than 21 million individuals [roughly 25 million based on current census data] - do not have government-issued photo identification.\\" Its work on advocacy and legal aid has been described Professor Carol Anderson, author of One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy, as one that ‚Äúmakes the difference in whether thousands of people get to vote or are disenfranchised.‚Äù Professor Joshua A. Douglas of the UK College of Law has called VoteRiders ‚Äúone of the most important democracy groups you‚Äôve probably never heard of,‚Äù VoteRiders was founded in 2012 by Kathleen Unger, an election integrity specialist since 2002, and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Activities VoteRiders, a 501(c)(3) national tax-exempt organization, has been featured extensively in local, national and international media in connection with voter ID issues. And VoteRiders' President Kathleen Unger has been asked to speak on voter ID issues at colleges and universities such as Pepperdine University, Occidental College., Stanford University and Columbia University. To promote the cause of ballot access nationwide, VoteRiders has developed its website to be a comprehensive portal for state-by-state information about voter ID requirements. The home page features a newsfeed for regular updates about upcoming state and local elections, current news stories regarding changes in voting laws, and personal testimonials from citizens who have experienced issues with registering to vote or obtaining a valid ID for the polls. VoteRiders has developed printable wallet cards that highlight the IDs specified in each state's voter ID law in English and Spanish, which are available on its website. They also established a toll free helpline that citizens can call or text for voter ID information and assistance. The non- profit's voter outreach includes holding Voter ID Clinics, which provide direct aid to local communities to assist citizens in obtaining critical documents like birth certificates and proof of citizenship. The VoteRiders volunteer team participates in outreach such as training, tabling, phone- and text-banking and partners with national organizations such as the Election Protection Coalition and Rock the Vote as well as state and local organizations.  VoteRiders on the ground  Voter ID laws vary nationwide. According to a study cited in Journalist's Resource, a reference desk established by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, the ‚Äúevidence supports the notion that strict voter identification laws prevent otherwise eligible individuals from voting, and have disproportionately negative impacts on minority citizens.‚Äù To help ensure that all eligible citizens can exercise their right to vote, VoteRiders gets involved with on-the-ground voter education initiatives and provides expertise to local, national, niche and youth-oriented media outlets to reach voters and increase awareness of potential obstacles to voting. Recent examples of these efforts include the following: * VoteRiders partnered with Facebook to integrate state-by-state guidance on voter ID laws into Facebook's early voting tool. This allows users nationwide to access ID requirements as they create their voting plans. VoteRiders' Voter ID Chatbot is available via SMS, Facebook Messenger and website chat, allowing voters across the country to get real-time guidance from VoteRiders. * VoteRiders partnered with Lyft to distribute unique state voter ID information cards to Lyft Hubs across the country for drivers to carry in their vehicles. * A 2019 documentary narrated by Jeffrey Wright, \\"Rigged: The Voter Suppression Playbook,\\" included clips that featured VoteRiders. *Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr. quoted Professor Carol Anderson in a November 8, 2019 column on voter suppression: ‚ÄúSupport civil-society organizations that are doing so much to help folks get registered to vote and get out the vote.

Those are the folks doing some heavy lifting fighting for this democracy...‚Äù * VoteRiders founder Kathleen Unger wrote a column entitled ‚ÄúEnd the voting confusion and misinformation war,‚Äù which was published in The Hill on October 30, 2018. * The New York Times referenced VoteRiders as a source of information on voter ID requirements in a November 6, 2018 article about questions voters may have about voting in the midterm elections. * VoteRiders public service announcements and contact information have been shared on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter by numerous celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Ryan Seacrest, Jonathan Van Ness and Kerry Washington. * Crooked Media‚Äôs \\"Vote Save America\\" page informs voters about upcoming elections and cites VoteRiders as a resource for citizens who need information about their state‚Äôs ID requirements. Crooked Media‚Äôs ‚ÄúSave My State‚Äù initiatives have been retweeted by numerous high-profile individuals, including President Obama. * In the run-up to the 2018 election, VoteRiders was mentioned as a resource to help voters obtain ID in a Glamour magazine article about modern attempts to disenfranchise women and people of color. * Professor Carol Anderson, author of One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy, was interviewed on \\"The Daily Show\\" on October 1, 2018, and at KQED News on October 23, 2018, where she discussed modern-day voter suppression and mentioned VoteRiders as a resource for people who need voter ID. * A VoteRiders coordinator was quoted in an Essence article published on November 1, 2018 about the importance of ensuring that black women participate in the democratic process. * In June 2020, Magnolia Pictures and Participant media company announced the release of a documentary: ‚ÄúJohn Lewis: Good Trouble.‚Äù The film celebrates the legacy of Georgia congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis. To coincide with the documentary‚Äôs release, Participant announced a Good Trouble impact campaign to provide support for disenfranchised communities and raise awareness of voting rights. VoteRiders partnered with other organizations to support the campaign and organized a virtual screening in August 2020. In a comment for a BET.com article on the film and campaign, VoteRiders COO Shannon Anderson said, ‚ÄúVoteRiders‚Äô mission is inspired by John Lewis‚Äô lifelong commitment to our democracy and our fundamental right to vote.‚Äù * In the 2020 election, 34 states will require a government-issued photo ID or an official document such as a bank statement, paystub or utility bill showing an address to vote in person. VoteRiders founder Kathleen Unger noted that in many states ‚Äúit‚Äôs not enough to register to vote.‚Äù She announced that VoteRiders is partnering with major law firms and other voter protection groups to provide assistance to voters who need information on the ID laws in their state and help them obtain the required ID. * Unger raised the alarm about the possibility that signature matching problems on mail-in ballots could become the ‚Äúhanging chad of 2020‚Äù since more voters are expected to vote by mail due to the pandemic. She noted that older voters, younger voters and voters with disabilities may be especially vulnerable to having their ballots disqualified due to signature matching issues. VoteRiders informs and helps voters as well as partners and other national organizations in addition to state and local organizations in 18 states ‚Äî including Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin ‚Äî all of which, except for Minnesota, have voter ID laws. Some of VoteRiders‚Äô on the ground efforts include: =Alabama= VoteRiders founder Kathleen Unger was quoted in an October 30, 2018 article in the Montgomery Advertiser on Alabama's photo ID law: \\"At this point, we see 25 million eligible voters nationally who do not have a current government issued photo ID, which is the primary type of ID that states require. We've discovered over time that many millions more eligible voters are so confused and intimidated by voter ID laws, which are complicated and onerous, that they won‚Äôt vote, even though they have valid ID.\\" The article noted VoteRiders‚Äô work with local groups in Alabama, including Faith in Action, to educate voters and help them secure ID, quoting Unger again: \\"It is understandable that people would feel overwhelmed by the legalities of voter ID laws. The key reason for our existence is to make it easy. ... Our goal is for people to be fully prepared and fully confident.\\" In the weeks preceding the December 2017 Roy Moore‚ÄìDoug Jones special election to the U.S. Senate in Alabama, VoteRiders actively assisted voters in obtaining the IDs that made them eligible to cast a ballot. =Florida= After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, the island experienced the largest out-migration in its history, and Florida was the top destination to resettle in the aftermath of the storm. In June 2018, VoteRiders began a campaign to assist resettled citizens who wished to cast a ballot in Florida, educating potential voters on what documents are required and helping them secure identification. =Georgia= Georgia's ‚Äúexact match‚Äù law resulted in widespread confusion about voter ID requirements and eligibility in the 2018 election. VoteRiders developed targeted digital and radio public service announcements to provide comprehensive and timely information. The public service announcements were widely shared on Facebook, including by celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, who has 16 million followers on the social media platform. Ryan Seacrest referenced VoteRiders on Twitter, reminding Georgia voters about the election and voter ID requirements. =Texas= In response to a 2012 Justice Department report that some 1.4 million Texans would be affected by the Texas Voter ID Law, VoteRiders hosted its first Voter ID Clinic in Houston on September 21, 2013, and in May 2014, the organization hired a coordinator to work with local groups on voter ID initiatives. VoteRiders also reached out to elected officials on the federal, state and local levels in Harris County and contacted precinct chairs for both the Republican and Democratic parties. Tables with information on the new law were set up at church services and other public gatherings. Partner organizations hosted presentations to explain the new law to the public. Volunteers were trained for voter outreach. It was a first step toward VoteRiders' ultimate goal: a nationwide network of partner organizations and volunteers dedicated to helping eligible citizens get the documents they need to vote. VoteRiders‚Äô partner Mi Familia Vota Texas distributed wallet-sized VoteRiders' Texas Voter ID Information Cards as part of their canvassing effort in six majority Latino precincts in Houston for the November 2016 election. While overall Houston/Harris County voter turnout decreased by 1% (compared with the 2012 presidential election), turnout in these six precincts increased cumulatively by 92% and by an average of almost 9%; and in 2018, turnout in the 13 precincts where Mi Familia Vota Texas distributed VoteRiders' Voter ID Information Cards increased by an average of 435% (compared to 2014). =Wisconsin= VoteRiders participated in on-the- ground voter ID requirement awareness and outreach campaigns in Wisconsin since 2015, forming coalitions with local leaders and engaging in education efforts via regional media. An interview with Milwaukee's alternative weekly newspaper, Shepherd Express, highlighted VoteRiders‚Äô role as the source of wallet-sized Voter ID Information Cards and voter ID clinic resources. A VoteRiders statewide coordinator was featured in a video produced by NowThis Politics, which has more than 6 million Facebook followers. VoteRiders was featured in a 2018 investigative piece about how Wisconsin voter ID laws posed challenges to the young, the elderly and people of color; the article stated that the organization's services include ‚Äúarranging transportation to local Division of Motor Vehicle offices, free legal assistance in obtaining proper documentation, and covering the costs of documents required for registering to vote such as birth certificates and Social Security cards.‚Äù It is estimated that approximately 600,000 (18%) of registered Wisconsin voters in 2016 were negatively impacted by the state's newly enforced voter ID law. This number includes more than 300,000 registered voters who did not have an acceptable voter photo ID and an additional 300,000 voters who were confused and intimidated by the state's voter ID law even though they did have the correct ID. This reality motivated VoteRiders to lead the nation's first ever \\"Voter ID Month,\\" which took place in Wisconsin in March 2016. VoteRiders‚Äô efforts in Wisconsin were spearheaded by national and state coordinators, including Anita Johnson, Wisconsin Statewide Coordinator, who worked with the organization's partners, such as the Dane County Voter ID Coalition. Reporting directly to VoteRiders founder Kathleen Unger, these coordinators' efforts included training volunteers, including throughout Dane County, interacting with thousands of voters to make sure they had valid ID and, if not, helping them obtain documents to get voter ID, and arranging transportation to the DMV, oftentimes with a member of VoteRiders' team to assist. Activities were focused especially on low-income and transient voters (including young professionals) by way of events and presentations with voters at churches, colleges, high schools, libraries, homeless shelters, food pantries, job centers, education centers, apartment buildings and corporations, etc., in downtown Madison and throughout the county. Examples include phone banks, the University of Wisconsin-Madison (with 14,000 out-of-state students), \\"Get It Free with Your Voter ID\\" pizza parties, and T-shirts with \\"Ask Me\\" (front) and \\"About Voter ID\\" (back). On March 2, 2016, VoteRiders' team was responsible for organizing a press conference at the capitol that resulted in significant media attention, including coverage by all TV network affiliates. VoteRiders played a pivotal role in the Wisconsin legislature's and governor's decision to expand approved voter IDs to include a Veterans Affairs card. Based on the results of Voter ID Month, VoteRiders created toolkits for distribution to other communities in Wisconsin and across the country. In 2020, VoteRiders became involved with Wisconsin and other states, working to measure and address the impact of COVID-19 on voter turnout for the 2020 US presidential election. Anita Johnson, Wisconsin Voter ID Coalition Coordinator at VoteRiders, was quoted in a Los Angeles Times report on the hurdles Black voters face: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad that we should have to jump through hoops just to go exercise our right to vote.‚Äù  Supporters * Foundation Supporters **Newman's Own Foundation **Five Together Foundation **The Ziering Family Foundation of the Jewish Community Foundation of Los Angeles * Corporate Supporters **AerioConnect **Galaxy Theatres **Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe  VoteRiders Partner Organizations National Partner Organizations The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is the lead partner of the non- partisan Election Protection Coalition, of which VoteRiders is a partner.

The 33.671 km long route branches in Freilassing as a single-track line from the double-track Rosenheim‚ÄìSalzburg railway. It is classified as a line as far as Bad Reichenhall and from there as branch line. The section between Bad Reichenhall-Kirchberg and Hallthurm is considered a steep section with specific operational requirements under Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs regulations. History and former sidings The Freilassing‚ÄìBad Reichenhall section was opened in 1866. In 1867, a project for a railway from Reichenhall to Berchtesgaden was approved, with assistance from the Administration of the Bavarian mountains, iron works, and salt works (). The construction of the Reichenhall‚ÄìBerchtesgaden section was completed in 1884. On 25 October 1888 a festively decorated first train ran from Reichenhall to Berchtesgaden. The travel time for the entire route was initially 90 minutes and it was later reduced to 70 minutes. In 1914 the line was electrified. The AC power was supplied by the Saalach power station in Bad Reichenhall-Kirchberg, which is fed by lake Saalachsee and still supplies power for trains. The electric train operations started in 1916 with specially designed electric locomotives of class EP 3/6. There used to be a 70-metre-long tunnel on a curve near the former Gmundbr√ºcke station at Tristram Gorge. Its profile was too restrictive to allow the introduction of 4-axle carriages, so in 1933/34 it was opened out to form a cutting. From 1909 to 1965 there was a connection at the end of the line at Berchtesgaden to the K√∂nigssee Railway (K√∂nigsseebahn) to the lake of K√∂nigssee. Another connecting line existed from 1908 to 1938, the Berchtesgaden‚ÄìHangender Stein railway, also called the Gr√ºne Elektrische (‚ÄúGreen Electric‚Äù). This line was connected in turn to the Salzburg‚ÄìHangender Stein railway, which was called the Rote Elektrische (‚ÄúRed Electric‚Äù). During the Third Reich, this rail link was closed as part of the planned duplication of the railway and the upgrading of the main road. Since then buses have run, which are dubbed the Watzmann Express. Work on the railway upgrade was begun but, due to the war, it was never completed. Even today, a tunnel without tracks near Berchtesgaden station is a reminder of that unfinished railway project. = Rolling stock = The line commenced operations using Bavarian branch line locomotives of class D VIII. Even Glaskasten (‚Äúglass box‚Äù) locomotives were occasionally seen on the line. After electrification the line was operated with electric traction. Initially, class E 36 01-04 and 21-24 E 36 locomotives were used for mixed traffic. In freight transport, and shunting operations to Hallthurm yard class 21-22 E 70 and E 79 01-02 locomotives were used. After experiments with single axle electric locomotives (class E 73 01-02), eight electric locomotives of Deutsche Reichsbahn class E 44.5 (numbered as 144502-509 under Deutsche Bundesbahn) provided the majority of traction on this route for half a century (1930s to their retirement in 1983). The machines were located in Freilassing depot. Locomotive no 144 502, the original member of the locomotive class, is set up as a memorial at Freilassing station. No 144 508 is located in the Freilassing Locomotive World museum. In addition, even no 144 507 has been preserved and is kept in the former Weimar locomotive depot by Th√ºringer Eisenbahnfreunde (\\"Thuringian railway friends\\"). Locomotives of various classes were used for shunting to the Hallthurm depot.  Long distance services  An Intercity pair of trains (2082/2083), the K√∂nigssee runs from Hamburg to Berchtesgaden and back once a day, providing a direct connection between several German cities and the holiday resorts in the Berchtesgaden area. Since the Intercity sets terminate each night in Freilassing for logistical reasons, each morning the Intercity sets return from Freilassing to Berchtesgaden and then run from there to Hamburg. In the afternoons, the procedure is similar, that is the services coming from Hamburg immediately return to Freilassing after their arrival. These four train movements each day replace regular services of the Berchtesgadener Land Bahn (BLB). Therefore, passengers with tickets for local services can use these services as if they are Regional-Express services. Traction for these services is provided by √ñBB locomotives of class 1016/1116. As the trains running from Freilassing to Berchtesgaden and return run as Regionalbahn services, the train is operated and staffed by DB Regio. Another Intercity service to Berchtesgaden, the pair of trains (2428/2429) from the Ruhr, was, however, withdrawn at the timetable change in December 2007. This service also ran between Freilassing and Berchtesgaden in both directions as a regional train.  Local services = Salzburg S-Bahn = Since 2006, the line has been part of the Salzburg S-Bahn network and is integrated as line S 3 (Salzburg Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) or Golling‚ÄìAbtenau to Bad Reichenhall) and the superimposed line S 4 (Freilassing‚ÄìBerchtesgaden) service initially ran every hour. In the city of Salzburg there are now additional stops apart from the Hauptbahnhof. From June 2006 to December 2009, these services used as rolling stock √ñBB class 4023 and 4024 (Bombardier Talent) three carriage electrical multiple units. From the timetable change of 2009, the Talents operate only on line S 3 between Salzburg and Bad Reichenhall. On the Bavarian part of the S-Bahn line, the trains are operated by German personnel. =Berchtesgadener Land Bahn (BLB)= A BLB EMU between Bayerisch Gmain and Bad Reichenhall-Kirchberg Tenders were called for Regionalbahn services in the summer of 2006, which was won by a consortium consisting of Regentalbahn and Salzburg AG (a utility company largely owned by the state of Salzburg and the city of Salzburg) in October 2006. Operations are carried out under the brand name of Berchtesgadener Land Bahn (‚ÄúBerchtesgadener Land Railway‚Äù, officially Berchtesgadener LandBahn GmbH, BLB, which was founded as a company on 4 May 2009) and commenced at the timetable change on 13 December 2009. Originally, it was intended that services would be operated from the start of the line by five three-carriage Stadler FLIRT railcars leased from Angel Trains Europa (now called Alpha Trains, but operations were delayed until 24 and 25 February 2010, by a delay in the approval of the new railcars for the movement of passengers by the Federal Railway Authority (Eisenbahn- Bundesamt, EBA). Because BLB did not have its own rolling stock at first, services between Freilassing and Bad Reichenhall were operated using various borrowed replacement rail vehicles and a temporary replacement bus services was provided between Bad Reichenhall and Berchtesgaden. Berchtesgaden was again served by rail from 23 January 2010. Following the granting of approvals by the EBA, services with FLIRT sets commenced on 24 and 25 February 2010. But on the following night of 26 February 2010, four parked FLIRT sets were damaged by vandalism in Freilassing and Berchtesgaden stations so badly that at first replacement rolling stock had to be used. The FLIRT trains have operated on the line since 1 March 2010 and some services have continued across the border to Golling‚ÄìAbtenau since 12 April 2010. Freight The only freight worth mentioning runs between Freilassing and Hammerau. The bulk of the volume of freight are semi-finished steel products from the Annah√ºtte steel works in Hammerau and containers of household waste that are collected in the district and loaded on container wagons, bound for the Freilassing- Hofham waste transfer station and onward transportation for incineration in Burgkirchen an der Alz. At the stations in Bad Reichenhall and Berchtesgaden there are tracks serving loading and unloading ramps, which are used for the shipment by rail of military vehicles of the Bundeswehr to and from locations in Bad Reichenhall and Strub (in Bischofswiesen). The Neuen Saline siding in Bad Reichenhall is no longer used.

Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. It consists of 30 species of trees, known in Latin America by the common names poui, pau d'arco, or ip√™. The latter sometimes appears as epay or simply ipe (unaccented) in English. The large timber species are sometimes called lapacho or guayacan, but these names are more properly applied to the species Handroanthus lapacho and Handroanthus guayacan, respectively. The name Handroanthus was established in 1970,Handroanthus in International Plant Names Index. (see External links below). but was not generally accepted. In 1992, its species were included in Tabebuia in the most recent revision of that genus.Alwyn H. Gentry. 1992. \\"Bignoniaceae: Part II (Tribe Tecomeae)\\". Flora Neotropica Monograph 25(part 2):1-150. Handroanthus was resurrected in 2007 when a comparison of DNA sequences by cladistic methods showed that Tabebuia, as then circumscribed, was not monophyletic.Susan O. Grose and Richard G.

Handroanthus are indigenous from Central America to northern Argentina, Paraguay and Chile, with one species, Handroanthus billbergii, native to northern South America and the Antilles. Handroanthus are frequently cultivated far from their natural range, as ornamental trees, for their large and showy flowers. They easily become naturalized where introduced because their seeds are prolifically produced and widely scattered by the wind.George W. Staples and Derral R. Herbst. 2005. \\"A Tropical Garden Flora\\" Bishop Museum Press: Honolulu, HI, USA. Several species are important timber trees of the American tropics.Alwyn H.

Grose * Handroanthus subtilis (Sprague & Sandwith) S. Grose * Handroanthus umbellatus (Sonder) J.R. Mattos * Handroanthus vellosoi (Toledo) J.R. Mattos  Description  The following description is excerpted from the paper that resurrected Handroanthus in 2007. * Trees or occasionally shrubs. * Wood is very dense. Heartwood distinct from sapwood, olive brown to black, lapachol present in large quantities. * Leaves palmately (3)5-9_foliate. * Leaflets with various types of trichomes as well as lepidote scales. * Inflorescence with dichotomous branching. * Calyx coriaceous, campanulate, 5 dentate, pubescent. * Corolla tubular, yellow or magenta with yellow throat. * Stamens didynamous; Thecae divaricate; Staminode reduced. * Ovary conical to linear, bilocular. * Ovules in 2 to 10 series in each locule. * Fruit an elongate dehiscent capsule. * Seeds thin with 2 wings. Wings thin and sharply demarcated from seed body. Handroanthus is distinguished from Tabebuia by several morphological characters. The wood is among the hardest and heaviest known. The heartwood is distinct from the sapwood and contains large quantities of lapachol. Handroanthus has the same lepidote scales as Tabebuia, but also has various types of hair. The calyx is 5-dentate and campanulate to cupular. The corolla is yellow, except in those four species where it is magenta with a yellow throat. Tabebuia has only two yellow- flowered species, Tabebuia aurea and Tabebuia nodosa. The fruit of Handroanthus is rarely glabrous like that of Tabebuia. It usually ranges from sparsely pubescent to densely tomentose.  Uses  Handroanthus is widely used as ornamental tree in the tropics in landscaping gardens, public squares, and boulevards due to its impressive and colorful flowering. Many flowers appear on still leafless stems at the end of the dry season, making the floral display more conspicuous. Handroanthus impetiginosus, Handroanthus chrysotrichus, and Handroanthus ochraceus are well-known throughout the tropics. Handroanthus chrysanthus, Handroanthus guayacan, Handroanthus serratifolius, Handroanthus umbellatus, and Handroanthus vellosoi are also planted in warm climates.Anthony Huxley, Mark Griffiths, and Margot Levy (1992). The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening. The Macmillan Press, Limited: London. The Stockton Press: New York. (set). Handroanthus heptaphyllus, Handroanthus serratifolius, Handroanthus guayacan, Handroanthus chrysanthus, and Handroanthus billbergii are important timber trees of the Neotropics. The wood of Handroanthus billbergii is valued for carving. Indigenous peoples of the Amazon made hunting bows from the wood, which is the source of the common name pau d'arco, \\"bow stick\\". Much of the lumber from Handroanthus is exported. The wood is durable outdoors, where it is usually used for furniture and decking. It is increasingly popular as a decking material due to its insect resistance and durability. Handroanthus and the unrelated Guaiacum (Zygophyllaceae) produce the hardest, heaviest, and most durable wood of the American tropics. Dead trees of Handroanthus guayacan remain standing after they were killed by flooding of their habitat during construction of the Panama Canal. The wood of Handroanthus brings a high price. The wood of other species is sometimes fraudulently sold as Handroanthus. By 2007, FSC-certified ip√™ wood had become readily available on the market, although certificates are occasionally forged.FSC Watch: SmartWood misled US local authority over FSC timber. Posted 2007-AUG-22. Retrieved 2008-JAN-27. Much of the ip√™ imported into the United States is used for decking. Starting in the late 1960s, importing companies targeted large boardwalk projects to sell ip√™, beginning with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, which maintains the city's boardwalks, including along the beach of Coney Island. The city began using ip√™ around that time and has since converted the entire boardwalk‚Äîover long‚Äîto ip√™. The ip√™ lasted about 25 years, at which time (1994) the department began replacing it with new ip√™. La Sultana, a yacht refashioned from a Soviet spy vessel, was fitted with an ip√™ deck during its restoration.La Sultana Superyacht: The Spy Ship You Can Sunbathe On. Billionaire. 14 September 2015. Tara Loader Wilkinson. 24 December 2015. In 2008-2009, Wildwood, New Jersey, rebuilt a section of its boardwalk using ip√™. The town had pledged to use domestic black locust, but it was not available in time. Given that ip√™ trees typically grow in densities of only one or two trees per , large areas of forest must be searched and cut down to create paths to harvest the trees to fill orders for boardwalks and to a lesser extent, homeowner decks. Medical claims for Handroanthus are numerous, but so far, have always originated from unreliable sources. For this reason, the extensive literature on this subject is not reviewed here. The bark of several species of Handroanthus is sold in South American markets. Similar-looking bark is often fraudulently passed off as Handroanthus. It is used in various ways to relieve certain symptoms of certain cancers. No evidence shows that it prevents the disease or slows its progression, as is often claimed. The bark is dried, shredded, and then boiled to make a bitter or sour-tasting brownish-colored tea. Tea from the inner bark of pink ip√™ (Handroanthus impetiginosus) is known as pau d'arco, lapacho, or taheebo. Its main active ingredients are lapachol, quercetin, and other flavonoids. A dehydrated tea is also available in pill form. Taheebo has been used for years in Central America and South America to Therapy treat a number of diseases including Eczema, Candidiasis, Fungal infections and even cancer. The worth and use of Taheebo extract has been related to the importance of quinine, which is taken from the bark of the South American Cinchona tree and is a medicinally accepted treatment for malaria. The herbal remedy is typically used during flu and cold season and for easing smoker's cough. It apparently works as an expectorant, by promoting the lungs to cough up and free deeply embedded mucus and contaminants. However, lapachol is rather toxic and therefore a more topical use e.g. as antibiotic or pesticide may be advisable. Other species with significant folk medical use are Handroanthus albus and Handroanthus serratifolius. Handroanthus ochraceus (synonym: Tabebuia heteropoda), Handroanthus incanus, and other species are occasionally used as an additive to the entheogenic drink Ayahuasca.Jonathan Ott. 1995. In: Ayahuasca Analogues: Pangaean Entheogens.  Ecology  The nectar of Handroanthus flowers is an important food source for several species of bees and hummingbirds. Mycosphaerella tabebuiae, a plant pathogenic sac fungus was first discovered on a Handroanthus tree, known at that time as Tabebuia. The taxonomy of Mycosphaerella is in much confusion and the recognition of this name is questionable.  Symbolism  Because of its popularity, Handroanthus has often been adopted as a symbol or emblem for nations or other political divisions. The distinction between national flower and national tree is sometimes not entirely clear. Gentry (1992) gives the following information without making that distinction. * Brazil - Handroanthus serratifolius * Ecuador - Handroanthus chrysanthus * Paraguay - Handroanthus heptaphyllus * Venezuela - Handroanthus billbergii  History  Araguaney (Handroanthus chrysanthus) tree on a Caracas street Leaves of pink ip√™ (Handroanthus impetiginosus) in detail The genus Handroanthus was erected by Jo√°o Rodrigues de Mattos in 1970.Jo√°o Rodrigues de Mattos. 1970. \\"Handroanthus, Um novo g√™nero para os \\"ip√™s\\" do Brasil\\". Loefgrenia 50: 1-4. It was named for the Brazilian botanist Oswaldo Handro. \\"Anthus\\" is derived from a Greek word for \\"flower\\". Most botanists at that time did not agree with the separation of Handroanthus from Tabebuia. Alwyn H. Gentry objected strenuously and warned against \\"succumbing to further paroxysms of unwarranted splitting\\".Alwyn H. Gentry. 1972. \\"Handroanthus (Bignoniaceae): A critique\\". Taxon 21(1):113-114. In 1992, Gentry published a full taxonomic treatment of Tabebuia, in which he described 99 species and one hybrid for the genus. These consist of the 67 species and one hybrid that remain in Tabebuia, the two species transferred to Roseodendron, and the 30 species that are now placed in Handroanthus. Gentry divided Tabebuia into 10 species groups. Handroanthus, as it is currently circumscribed, is composed of Gentry's groups 3, 4, and 5. Gentry believed group 5 to be natural, while groups 3 and 4 were artificial, designated for the sole purpose of easier identification. In 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study resolved Tabebuia as consisting of three strongly supported clades, none of which was sister to either of the others. Thus Tabebuia was shown to be polyphyletic. One of these clades consisted of the two species that constitute the genus Roseodendron. Another contained the type species for Tabebuia, and consequently retained that name. The name Handroanthus was resurrected for the third clade, which contained its type species, Handroanthus albus. Handroanthus is sister to a clade consisting of Spirotecoma, Parmentiera, Crescentia, and Amphitecna. It had for a long time been placed in the tribe Tecomeae, but that tribe has been greatly reduced to only 11 or 12 genera and no longer includes Handroanthus. Handroanthus is one of the 12 to 14 genera that make up a group informally known as the Tabebuia alliance.Richard G. Olmstead, Michelle L. Zjhra, L√∫cia G. Lohmann, Susan O. Grose, and Andrew J. Eckert. 2009. \\"A molecular phylogeny and classification of Bignoniaceae\\". American Journal of Botany 96(9): 1731‚Äì1743. This group has not been assigned to any taxonomic rank, and neither has Crescentiina, the smallest group that it is a member of. Cladistic analysis of DNA data has strongly supported Handroanthus, but sampling of taxa and DNA has not been sufficient to strongly support any relationships within the genus.

History Quad charts as a genre were developed by the United States Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an attempt to improve budgeting and planning systems, and became widely used in the Administration's National Weather Service. The genre's development was parallel to that of display boards, also an early tool used by the NWS for staff communication. In the early 2000s, software was developed to allow automated creation of quad charts as a means of saving time for technical writers who would otherwise spend long periods of time drafting them.

Because decision makers often review a large volume of both solicited and unsolicited proposals, the quad chart may be the only submission from a potential contractor which the decision maker actually reads. Due to the nature of quad charts as relatively short documents, there are opportunities for misuse. While quad charts are intended for brief overviews of a topic, they can also be misconstrued to influence public policy and budgeting decisions, as was the case with the politicization of the National Defense Strategy's 2005 edition.Nathan P.

It belongs to a noble lineage according to Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent Chronicler King of Arms of the Kingdom of Spain and the last Cronista Rey de Armas appointed by the Spanish Ministry of Justice. The Mangubat surname were members of the Spanish nobility class and Filipino native royalty class with a Spanish heraldry of Azure shield, with a gold pike or pica, put on stick and positioned vertically at the center of the shield. As a family name it predated the year 1849 Claveria's Decree, an order requiring Filipino commoners to adopt an already existing Spanish family names made available and listed in the Catalogo Alfabetico de Apellidos. Restricted and exclusively used for the male descendants of Mangubat who was the king of Mactan and successor of Lapu-Lapu in the 16th century to avoid any false claims to special rights and nobility. As the kingdom of Mactan joined the Spanish Empire, in late 1560s the mangubat left Mactan Island for the conquest of Luzon, Mindanao, Borneo, and all the other Islands to unify the archipelago originally composed of several kingdoms and dominions with peoples of different cultures, religions, languages and ethnic backgrounds into one state known as the Spanish East Indies. with the (kingdom of Castile) as the mother country, united through Spanish Empire a confederated monarchy composed of many kingdoms and colonies. The Spanish East Indies (chiefly the Philippine Archipelago) then known as the Philippine Republic as it was transferred to the U.S. and given its independence in 1946. Before the American came to the Philippines, and before the Republic of the Philippines existed as a Sovereign state in 1946, the Philippine archipelago and the Kingdom of Mactan were part of the territory of the Spanish Empire up to 1899 as Datu Mangubat and other Visayan monarchs joined the Empire. Filipino Indian monarchs became Filipino Spanish kings, and their warriors were converted into Spanish Imperial Army of the Spanish East Indies Territory, particularly those Indian kingdoms that helped the European Spanish Expeditionary team to gain foothold in the region and voluntarily set out for conquest using their own resources and people, Attacking neighboring kingdoms that refuses to be part of the Union. the term \\"Filipino\\" predated the Philippine Republic, and was used since the 1500s to denote Spanish people native to the now Philippine Archipelago. Mangubat when related to a name, it usually means marauders, pirates and warriors in the Visayas. Antonio de Morga, in his book published in 1609 Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas (Events of the Philippine Islands), mentions that the term means \\"to go to war and raid for plunder\\" and described the native as \\"a race less inclined to agriculture, skillful in navigation and eager for war and raids for pillage and booty\\". the term was also used by Francisco Baltazar (1778‚Äì1862) in his 1838 book Florante at Laura to means \\"to go for battle\\". The term is derived from two Filipino words ‚Äì the verb mang (to do) and the noun gubat (war). \\"Gubat\\" is a common word for war in the language of the Visayans,the ancient Tagalog, the Ilocano people, the Igorot people, in Mindanao, and in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.  Etymology  The term is ancient, appearing in both noun and verb forms in the books contemporaneous with the pintados age. A mangubat was a man who left his homeland, family, and people for war adventure, mainly for tattooing for honor and fame or sometimes for slave-raiding, with the implication that he planned to return home with his newly won fortune and fame. It does not include the concept of staying in the place one has conquered for in the Pintados culture for one to have a tattoo one must prove himself in battle. The word existed in both a noun form (mangubat, the person traveling for war adventure) and a verb form (mangubat, to travel for war or participate in one of these adventures).  Coat of arms  Mangubat was a Spanish Military Order formed in the 16th century. It belongs to the native conquistadores of Mactan who allied with the Spaniards as Datu Mangubat of the kingdom of Mactan was converted to Christianity (he was the son and successor of Lapu-Lapu ) The military unit have a coat of arms, or emblems to distinguish them from other military units, and was the most elite and warlike spanish military order of the Spanish East Indies and in the whole Spanish empire at the time as depicted in their Coat of arms. The coat was granted under the strict rules, and requirements of Heraldry rewarded for destroying the muslim kingdoms of Luzon and in Mindanao whose leaders at one time promised to pay tributaries to Spain and until the time it revolted in the 1600 taking advantaged of the revolutions made by Christians in Luzon and in different parts of the Country Symbolism The Azure shield Signify Blue Blooded, Royalty and Nobility. Justice, Truth, and Loyalty. The Pica(Pike) represent Honorable Warrior and Valiant Knight, emblem of gallant Military and Knightly service, The perfection of Martial affairs. In contrast to the lance that stands for, Strength and Prudence. The pike symbolizes Military Valor, Strength, and Prudence The gold Pica(pike) means noble and conquistador or Spanish Hidalgo. The stick means Jurisdiction and authority.  Brief description of the Mangubat warriors  \\"Their weapons consist of large knives curved like cutlasses (Sanggot), spears (Bancao,bangkaw) and cara√ßas (shields). They employ the same kinds of boats as the inhabitants of Luzon. They have the same occupations, products, and means of gain as the inhabitants of all the other islands (i.e. Islands of the Visayas and Mindanao). These Visayans which they call Mangubat are a race less inclined to agriculture, and are skilful in navigation, and eager for war and raids for pillage and booty. Mangubat, this means \\"to go out for plunder.\\"  Dissemination  The majority of people with the surname live in the Bantayan Island , Daanbantayan, Cavite, Batangas, Zamboanga del sur and Mactan Island  Mangubat people  Mangubat line of succession From year 1565 up to the 1780s the title of cabeza was hereditary, passing to the oldest son from the first datus who became cabezas.

Its main function is to cut DNA and thereby alter a cell's genome. The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was a significant contributor to the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 being awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna. More technically, Cas9 is a dual RNA-guided DNA endonuclease enzyme associated with the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) adaptive immune system in Streptococcus pyogenes. S. pyogenes utilizes CRISPR to memorize and Cas9 to later interrogate and cleave foreign DNA, such as invading bacteriophage DNA or plasmid DNA. Cas9 performs this interrogation by unwinding foreign DNA and checking for sites complementary to the 20 basepair spacer region of the guide RNA. If the DNA substrate is complementary to the guide RNA, Cas9 cleaves the invading DNA. In this sense, the CRISPR-Cas9 mechanism has a number of parallels with the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism in eukaryotes. Apart from its original function in bacterial immunity, the Cas9 protein has been heavily utilized as a genome engineering tool to induce site-directed double-strand breaks in DNA. These breaks can lead to gene inactivation or the introduction of heterologous genes through non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination respectively in many laboratory model organisms. Alongside zinc finger nucleases and Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (Talen) proteins, Cas9 is becoming a prominent tool in the field of genome editing. Cas9 has gained traction in recent years because it can cleave nearly any sequence complementary to the guide RNA. Because the target specificity of Cas9 stems from the guide RNA:DNA complementarity and not modifications to the protein itself (like TALENs and zinc fingers), engineering Cas9 to target new DNA is straightforward. Versions of Cas9 that bind but do not cleave cognate DNA can be used to locate transcriptional activator or repressors to specific DNA sequences in order to control transcriptional activation and repression. Native Cas9 requires a guide RNA composed of two disparate RNAs that associate ‚Äì the CRISPR RNA (crRNA), and the trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). Cas9 targeting has been simplified through the engineering of a chimeric single guide RNA (chiRNA). Scientists have suggested that Cas9-based gene drives may be capable of editing the genomes of entire populations of organisms. In 2015, Cas9 was used to modify the genome of human embryos for the first time.  CRISPR-mediated immunity  To survive in a variety of challenging, inhospitable habitats that are filled with bacteriophages, bacteria and archaea have evolved methods to evade and fend off predatory viruses. This includes the CRISPR system of adaptive immunity. In practice, CRISPR/Cas systems act as self-programmable restriction enzymes. CRISPR loci are composed of short, palindromic repeats that occur at regular intervals composed of alternate CRISPR repeats and variable CRISPR spacers between 24-48 nucleotides long. These CRISPR loci are usually accompanied by adjacent CRISPR-associated (cas) genes. In 2005, it was discovered by three separate groups that the spacer regions were homologous to foreign DNA elements, including plasmids and viruses. These reports provided the first biological evidence that CRISPRs might function as an immune system. Cas9 has been used often as a genome-editing tool. Cas9 has been used in recent developments in preventing viruses from manipulating hosts‚Äô DNA. Since the CRISPR-Cas9 was developed from bacterial genome systems, it can be used to target the genetic material in viruses. The use of the enzyme Cas9 can be a solution to many viral infections. Cas9 possesses the ability to target specific viruses by the targeting of specific strands of the viral genetic information. More specifically the Cas9 enzyme targets certain sections of the viral genome that prevents the virus from carrying out its normal function. Cas9 has also been used to disrupt the detrimental strand of DNA and RNA that cause diseases and mutated strands of DNA. Cas9 has already showed promise in disrupting the effects of HIV-1. Cas9 has been shown to suppress the expression of the long terminal repeats in HIV-1. When introduced into the HIV-1 genome Cas9 has shown the ability to mutate strands of HIV-1. Cas9 has also been used in the treatment of hepatitis b through targeting of the ends of certain of long terminal repeats in the hepatitis b viral genome. Cas9 has been used to repair the mutations causing cataracts in mice. Fig. 2: The Stages of CRISPR immunity CRISPR-Cas systems are divided into three major types (type I, type II, and type III) and twelve subtypes, which are based on their genetic content and structural differences. However, the core defining features of all CRISPR-Cas systems are the cas genes and their proteins: cas1 and cas2 are universal across types and subtypes, while cas3, cas9, and cas10 are signature genes for type I, type II, and type III, respectively. =CRISPR-Cas defence stages= Adaptation  Adaptation involves recognition and integration of spacers between two adjacent repeats in the CRISPR locus. The ‚ÄúProtospacer‚Äù refers to the sequence on the viral genome that corresponds to the spacer. A short stretch of conserved nucleotides exists proximal to the protospacer, which is called the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). The PAM is a recognition motif that is used to acquire the DNA fragment. In type II, Cas9 recognizes the PAM during adaptation in order to ensure the acquisition of functional spacers.  CRISPR processing/biogenesis  CRISPR expression includes the transcription of a primary transcript called a CRISPR RNA (pre-crRNA), which is transcribed from the CRISPR locus by RNA polymerase. Specific endoribonucleases then cleave the pre-crRNAs into small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs).  Interference/immunity  Interference involves the crRNAs within a multi-protein complex called CASCADE, which can recognize and specifically base-pair with regions of inserting complementary foreign DNA. The crRNA-foreign nucleic acid complex is then cleaved, however if there are mismatches between the spacer and the target DNA, or if there are mutations in the PAM, then cleavage will not be initiated. In the latter scenario, the foreign DNA is not targeted for attack by the cell, thus the replication of the virus proceeds and the host is not immune to viral infection. The interference stage can be mechanistically and temporally distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression, yet for complete function as a defense system, all three phases must be functional. Stage 1: CRISPR spacer integration. Protospacers and protospacer-associated motifs (shown in red) are acquired at the ‚Äúleader‚Äù end of a CRISPR array in the host DNA. The CRISPR array is composed of spacer sequences (shown in colored boxes) flanked by repeats (black diamonds). This process requires Cas1 and Cas2 (and Cas9 in type II), which are encoded in the cas locus, which are usually located near the CRISPR array. Stage 2: CRISPR expression. Pre-crRNA is transcribed starting at the leader region by the host RNA polymerase and then cleaved by Cas proteins into smaller crRNAs containing a single spacer and a partial repeat (shown as hairpin structure with colored spacers). Stage 3: CRISPR interference. crRNA with a spacer that has strong complementarity to the incoming foreign DNA begins a cleavage event (depicted with scissors), which requires Cas proteins. DNA cleavage interferes with viral replication and provides immunity to the host. The interference stage can be functionally and temporarily distinct from CRISPR acquisition and expression (depicted by white line dividing the cell). = Transcription deactivation using dCas9 = dCas9, also referred to as endonuclease deficient Cas9 can be utilized to edit gene expression when applied to the transcription binding site of the desired section of a gene. The optimal function of dCas9 is attributed to its mode of action. Gene expression is inhibited when nucleotides are no longer added to the RNA chain and therefore terminating elongation of that chain, and as a result affects the transcription process. This process occurs when dCas9 is mass-produced so it is able to affect the most amount of genes at any given time via a sequence specific guide RNA molecule. Since dCas9 appears to down regulate gene expression, this action is amplified even more when it is used in conjunction with repressive chromatin modifier domains. The dCas9 protein has other functions outside of the regulation of gene expression. A promoter can be added to the dCas9 protein which allows them to work with each other to become efficient at beginning or stopping transcription at different sequences along a strand of DNA. These two proteins are specific in where they act on a gene. This is prevalent in certain types of prokaryotes when a promoter and dCas9 align themselves together to impede the ability of elongation of polymer of nucleotides coming together to form a transcribed piece of DNA. Without the promoter, the dCas9 protein does not have the same effect by itself or with a gene body. When examining the effects of repression of transcription further, H3K27, an amino acid component of a histone, becomes methylated through the interaction of dCas9 and a peptide called FOG1. Essentially, this interaction causes gene repression on the C + N terminal section of the amino acid complex at the specific junction of the gene, and as a result, terminates transcription. dCas9 also proves to be efficient when it comes to altering certain proteins that can create diseases. When the dCas9 attaches to a form of RNA called guide-RNA, it prevents the proliferation of repeating codons and DNA sequences that might be harmful to an organism's genome. Essentially, when multiple repeat codons are produced, it elicits a response, or recruits an abundance of dCas9 to combat the overproduction of those codons and results in the shut-down of transcription. dCas9 works synergistically with gRNA and directly affects the DNA polymerase II from continuing transcription. Further explanation of how the dCas9 protein works can be found in their utilization of plant genomes by the regulation of gene production in plants to either increase or decrease certain characteristics. The CRISPR-CAS9 system has the ability to either upregulate or downregulate genes. The dCas9 proteins are a component of the CRISPR-CAS9 system and these proteins can repress certain areas of a plant gene. This happens when dCAS9 binds to repressor domains, and in the case of the plants, deactivation of a regulatory gene such as AtCSTF64, does occur. Bacteria are another focus of the usage of dCas9 proteins as well. Since eukaryotes have a larger DNA makeup and genome; the much smaller bacteria are easy to manipulate. As a result, eukaryotes use dCas9 to inhibit RNA polymerase from continuing the process of transcription of genetic material.  Structural and biochemical studies = Crystal structure = Crystal structure of CRISPR-associated protein Cas9, based on PDB 5AXW by Nishimasu et al. Cas9 features a bi-lobed architecture with the guide RNA nestled between the alpha-helical lobe (blue) and the nuclease lobe (cyan, orange, and gray). These two lobes are connected through a single bridge helix. There are two nuclease domains located in the multi-domain nuclease lobe, the RuvC (gray) which cleaves the non-target DNA strand, and the HNH nuclease domain (cyan) that cleaves the target strand of DNA. The RuvC domain is encoded by sequentially disparate sites that interact in the tertiary structure to form the RuvC cleavage domain (See right figure). Crystal structure of Cas9 in the Apo form. Structural rendition was performed using UCSF Chimera software. A key feature of the target DNA is that it must contain a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) consisting of the three-nucleotide sequence- NGG. This PAM is recognized by the PAM-interacting domain (PI domain, orange) located near the C-terminal end of Cas9. Cas9 undergoes distinct conformational changes between the apo, guide RNA bound, and guide RNA:DNA bound states. Cas9 recognizes the stem-loop architecture inherent in the CRISPR locus, which mediates the maturation of crRNA-tracrRNA ribonucleoprotein complex. Cas9 in complex with CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans- activating crRNA (tracrRNA) further recognizes and degrades the target dsDNA. In the co-crystal structure shown here, the crRNA-tracrRNA complex is replaced by a chimeric single-guide RNA (sgRNA, in red) which has been proved to have the same function as the natural RNA complex. The sgRNA base paired with target ssDNA is anchored by Cas9 as a T-shaped architecture. This crystal structure of the DNA-bound Cas9 enzyme reveals distinct conformational changes in the alpha-helical lobe with respect to the nuclease lobe, as well as the location of the HNH domain. The protein consists of a recognition lobe (REC) and a nuclease lobe (NUC). All regions except the HNH form tight interactions with each other and sgRNA-ssDNA complex, while the HNH domain forms few contacts with the rest of the protein. In another conformation of Cas9 complex observed in the crystal, the HNH domain is not visible. These structures suggest the conformational flexibility of HNH domain. To date, at least three crystal structures have been studied and published. One representing a conformation of Cas9 in the apo state, and two representing Cas9 in the DNA bound state. = Interactions with sgRNA = CRISPR/Cas9 In sgRNA-Cas9 complex, based on the crystal structure, REC1, BH and PI domains have important contacts with backbone or bases in both repeat and spacer region. Several Cas9 mutants including REC1 or REC2 domains deletion and residues mutations in BH have been tested. REC1 and BH related mutants show lower or none activity compared with wild type, which indicate these two domains are crucial for the sgRNA recognition at repeat sequence and stabilization of the whole complex. Although the interactions between spacer sequence and Cas9 as well as PI domain and repeat region need further studies, the co-crystal demonstrates clear interface between Cas9 and sgRNA. = DNA cleavage = Previous sequence analysis and biochemical studies have posited that Cas9 contains two nuclease domains: an McrA-like HNH nuclease domain and a RuvC- like nuclease domain. These HNH and RuvC-like nuclease domains are responsible for cleavage of the complementary/target and non-complementary/non-target DNA strands, respectively. Despite low sequence similarity, the sequence similar to RNase H has a RuvC fold (one member of RNase H family) and the HNH region folds as T4 Endo VII (one member of HNH endonuclease family). Wild-type S. pyogenes Cas9 requires magnesium (Mg2+) cofactors for the RNA-mediated DNA cleavage; however, Cas9 has been shown to exhibit varying levels of activity in the presence of other divalent metal ions. For instance, Cas9 in the presence of manganese (Mn2+) has been shown to be capable of RNA-independent DNA cleavage. The kinetics of DNA cleavage by Cas9 have been of great interest to the scientific community, as this data provides insight into the intricacies of the reaction. While the cleavage of DNA by RNA-bound Cas9 has been shown to be relatively rapid (k ‚â• 700 s‚àí1), the release of the cleavage products is very slow (t1/2 = ln(2)/k ‚âà 43-91 h), essentially rendering Cas9 a single-turnover enzyme. Additional studies regarding the kinetics of Cas9 have shown engineered Cas9 to be effective in reducing off-target effects by modifying the rate of the reaction. = Problems bacteria pose to Cas9 editing = Most archaea and bacteria stubbornly refuse to allow a Cas9 to edit their genome. This is because they can attach foreign DNA, that does not affect them, into their genome. Another way that these cells defy Cas9 is by process of restriction modification (RM) system. When a bacteriophage enters a bacteria or archaea cell it is targeted by the RM system. The RM system then cuts the bacteriophages DNA into separate pieces by restriction enzymes and uses endonucleases to further destroy the strands of DNA. This poses a problem to Cas9 editing because the RM system also targets the foreign genes added by the Cas9 process.  Applications of Cas9 to transcription tuning = Interference of transcription by dCas9 = Due to the unique ability of Cas9 to bind to essentially any complement sequence in any genome, researchers wanted to use this enzyme to repress transcription of various genomic loci. To accomplish this, the two crucial catalytic residues of the RuvC and HNH domain can be mutated to alanine abolishing all endonuclease activity of Cas9. The resulting protein coined ‚Äòdead‚Äô Cas9 or ‚ÄòdCas9‚Äô for short, can still tightly bind to dsDNA. This catalytically inactive Cas9 variant has been used for both mechanistic studies into Cas9 DNA interrogative binding and as a general programmable DNA binding RNA-Protein complex. The interaction of dCas9 with target dsDNA is so tight that high molarity urea protein denaturant can not fully dissociate the dCas9 RNA-protein complex from dsDNA target. dCas9 has been targeted with engineered single guide RNAs to transcription initiation sites of any loci where dCas9 can compete with RNA polymerase at promoters to halt transcription. Also, dCas9 can be targeted to the coding region of loci such that inhibition of RNA Polymerase occurs during the elongation phase of transcription. In Eukaryotes, silencing of gene expression can be extended by targeting dCas9 to enhancer sequences, where dCas9 can block assembly of transcription factors leading to silencing of specific gene expression. Moreover, the guide RNAs provided to dCas9 can be designed to include specific mismatches to its complementary cognate sequence that will quantitatively weaken the interaction of dCas9 for its programmed cognate sequence allowing a researcher to tune the extent of gene silencing applied to a gene of interest. This technology is similar in principle to RNAi such that gene expression is being modulated at the RNA level. However, the dCas9 approach has gained much traction as there exist less off-target effects and in general larger and more reproducible silencing effects through the use of dCas9 compared to RNAi screens. Furthermore, because the dCas9 approach to gene silencing can be quantitatively controlled, a researcher can now precisely control the extent to which a gene of interest is repressed allowing more questions about gene regulation and gene stoichiometry to be answered. Beyond direct binding of dCas9 to transcriptionally sensitive positions of loci, dCas9 can be fused to a variety of modulatory protein domains to carry out a myriad of functions. Recently, dCas9 has been fused to chromatin remodeling proteins (HDACs/HATs) to reorganize the chromatin structure around various loci. This is important in targeting various eukaryotic genes of interest as heterochromatin structures hinder Cas9 binding. Furthermore, because Cas9 can react to heterochromatin, it is theorized that this enzyme can be further applied to studying the chromatin structure of various loci. Additionally, dCas9 has been employed in genome wide screens of gene repression. By employing large libraries of guide RNAs capable of targeting thousands of genes, genome wide genetic screens using dCas9 have been conducted. Another method for silencing transcription with Cas9 is to directly cleave mRNA products with the catalytically active Cas9 enzyme. This approach is made possible by hybridizing ssDNA with a PAM complement sequence to ssRNA allowing for a dsDNA-RNA PAM site for Cas9 binding. This technology makes available the ability to isolate endogenous RNA transcripts in cells without the need to induce chemical modifications to RNA or RNA tagging methods. = Transcription activation by dCas9 fusion proteins = In contrast to silencing genes, dCas9 can also be used to activate genes when fused to transcription activating factors. These factors include subunits of bacterial RNA Polymerase II and traditional transcription factors in eukaryotes. Recently, genome-wide screens of transcription activation have also been accomplished using dCas9 fusions named ‚ÄòCRISPRa‚Äô for activation.

Ten were built. Design and development Pander D at Croydon When Vliegtuig Industrie Holland (VIH) (English: Aircraft Industry Holland) became insolvent in 1924, Its core staff and property were bought by H. Pander who set up Nederlandse Fabriek van Vliegtuigen H. Pander & Zonen (English:Dutch Aircraft Factory H. Pander & Sons) to produce aircraft. Their first design was a modified Holland H.2, an aircraft which VIH had derived from the Carley C.12. All were small, single-seat, shoulder wing monoplanes powered by a single three-cylinder Anzani producing about 22 kW (30 hp). The Pander D had the much more streamlined, rounded fuselage, quadrant shaped fin and faired headrest that VIH had used with the H.2; compared with the C.12, the Pander's wings were more tapered, had rounded tips and lacked the large cutouts in the trailing edge roots. The trailing edges of the elevators were unswept, not forward swept as on the C.12. The Pander D had a single piece, two spar wing which was attached to the upper fuselage longerons with pairs of yoked U-bolts. The spars were of the box type with spruce flanges and plywood webs, the front one forming a narrow chord D-box with ply covering around the wing leading edge. Aft of the front spar, the wing and ailerons, the latter mounted on false spars, were fabric covered. Similar methods were used in the tail structure. The fuselage was a monocoque structure of longerons and hoops, covered in three-ply. The fuselage was flat sided but deep and carefully made upper and lower fairings produced its overall rounded look. The high quality and lightness of the woodworking was remarked upon; Pandar had built his reputation and fortune in the furniture trade. As on the earlier versions of the Carley C.12 the cockpit was between the wing spars, faired by a coaming with a circular cutout. The fixed, conventional undercarriage was also similar to that of the C.12, with steel V-form struts hinged on the upper longerons supporting, via rubber shock absorbers, the landing wheels and outer ends of split axles, hinged to the central fuselage underside. The inverted Y-Anzani had a smooth, rounded cowling through which much of its cylinders protruded. It drove a two-bladed propeller. The Pandar D flew for the first time on 16 November 1924, with J. van Opstal at the controls. Operational history The Pander D appeared in public for the first time at the Paris Aero Show, where it was exhibited both on the Pander stand and in the air. It was offered for sale at ¬£450. The second prototype visited Croydon, UK for several days at the end of April 1925, giving demonstrations and being flown by many pilots. In August, one was in the UK again, racing at Lympne. In all ten Pander Ds were built, six as civilians and four military. Two examples were lost on test or delivery flights but two more civilians were sold in France and Spain, another was used for a time by a flying instructor in the Netherlands and a sixth went to the Dutch East Indies. Two Pander Ds were sold to the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service, though mostly used for pleasure flights, and two to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army who used them for stunt flying at airshows.

Its discovery was one of the most important landmarks in understanding tuberculosis and in molecular biology. It is regarded as the most toxic component of the bacillus. It was from this compound that DNA methylation was discovered as it was the first molecule found to contain 5-methylcytosine. In addition it contains thymine, guanine and cytosine. Discovery It was first identified by a German chemist W.G. Ruppel in 1898 while trying to isolate the bacterial toxin responsible for tuberculosis. From the crushed bacilli, specifically the protein tuberculin, he isolated two toxic substances, namely a basic compound which he called tuberculosamine, and a nucleotide he named tuberculis√§ure, later to be anglicised to tuberculinic acid. He claimed that the tuberculosamin was bound to the nucleotide. Ruppel also found that his new compound was the most toxic component of the bacillus, 2.5 to 6 times more potent than tuberculin, the proteinaceous toxin. In 1925, Treat Baldwin Johnson and Coghill were detected a minor amount of a methylated cytosine derivative as a product of hydrolysis of tuberculinic acid, from avian tubercle bacilli, with sulfuric acid. This report was seriously challenged because they failed to reproduce the result after a series of tests. But Johnson and Coghill were in fact proved correct. In 1948, Hotchkiss separated the nucleic acids of DNA from calf thymus using paper chromatography, by which he detected a unique methylated cytosine, quite distinct from cytosine and uracil.

It is found in shallow water in the tropical western Atlantic and the Caribbean Sea. Description and habitat Isophyllia sinuosa is a massive coral that forms hemispherical or dome-shaped mounds up to across. On the coral surface there are shallow, meandering valleys about wide separated by convoluted ridges topped with a central, pale-coloured line. The polyps are large and are situated in the valleys, often in groups of three. Although they are usually retracted into their corallites by day, they are unable to retract completely, giving the coral a fleshy feel when touched. The septa that radiate from the corallites are spiny. At night, when the polyps are fully extended, the coral has a fuzzy appearance. The ridges and valleys are usually made up of contrasting colours. These combinations include green/yellow, green/blue, purplish-blue/white and two shades of brown. Distribution Isophyllia sinuosa is found in the tropical west Atlantic. Its range includes the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, southern Florida, the Lesser Antilles, the Bahamas and Bermuda. It occurs on both back and fore reef slopes, on rocks, in lagoons and among seagrasses at depths down to about . Biology At night, the polyps of Isophyllia sinuosa extend their tentacles to feed on zooplankton. This coral is a zooxanthellate species, which means that it harbours symbiotic dinoflagellates (unicellular algae) in its tissues. These contain chlorophyll and can provide the coral with organic carbon compounds by photosynthesis. These are important to the coral and provide up to 50% of its nutrient requirements. A well-lit position is essential to zooxanthellate corals and Isophyllia sinuosa is one of the most aggressive corals, defending itself from the risk of being over-shadowed. It is reported to attack other corals or sponges in its close vicinity using an extracoelentric feeding mechanism in which specialised filament-like tentacles extend onto the living tissues of the neighbouring organisms, secreting enzymes which digest them in situ. Status Isophyllia sinuosa has a wide range but is generally an uncommon species. It is considered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to be of \\"Least Concern\\" as its population is believed to be stable. It is prone to bleaching, when a coral expels its zooxanthellae under stressful conditions, to black band disease, and to white plague. As a shallow water species it shares the threats posed to coral reefs in general which include a rise in sea temperatures, ocean acidification, coral diseases, storm damage, sedimentation, and human activities.

It opened in 1921, and was renamed Callister Park in 1942. After the demolition of the stadium in 1971, the area was redeveloped into a green space and retained the name Callister Park. Background Con Jones (right) with L√©o Dandurand (center) and Newsy Lalonde in 1912. In April 1885 builder and contractor John Callister arrived in Vancouver from the Isle of Man. Callister was a pioneer who built his home in a forested area covering about three blocks in 1904. Upon his death Callister, a bachelor, left his property to two nieces. One of the sisters died, and Mrs. Ada M. Stevenson inherited all of the property. On September 18, 1920, sports promoter Con Jones entered into an agreement to purchase \\"lot 5, Town of Hastings, Suburban Lands\\" for $10,000 from Stevenson. According to the Vancouver city archives only three payments of $1,000 were made. In the space of a year, Jones supervised the building of a grandstand and field and Con Jones Park opened in 1921. The park was destroyed by fire in June, 1934. Jones' sons rebuilt the stadium within weeks. Media reports stated that due to Jones' default on payment, Stevenson seized the property and offered to present the land to the city. While many focus on the lack of mortgage payments, it appears to be several years of unpaid city taxes that forced the issue. Both of Jones' sons had died, which brought this to light. The land reverted to the Callister estate, and Stevenson donated it to the city in lieu of paying the taxes on it. On March 20, 1942, Mrs. Stevenson entered into an agreement with the city to present the area for \\"municipal purposes\\". The bequest further stated that this expression...\\"be deemed to include exhibition, recreation or park purposes and the carrying on of public sports.\\" With the opening of Empire Stadium in 1954, many of the touring soccer teams from the United Kingdom shifted their friendlies to the much larger and more modern facility which was only a five minute walk away on the opposite side of the PNE grounds. Soccer at Callister Park From 1939 to 1970, the Pacific Coast League was one of the primary attractions at Callister Park. League matches were played at the stadium until January 1942, then again for every Pacific Coast League season from 1945-46 to 1969-70. British touring soccer From the time the PNE took possession of Callister Park - until the opening of Empire Stadium in 1954 - with soccer as its principal tenant Callister Park made money. The annual friendlies featuring touring British soccer teams playing against local all- star squads were the most profitable.[1] In 1921 Third Lanark played two games in Vancouver; one at Con Jones Park and the other at Brockton Oval at Stanley Park. Newcastle United visited on June 4, 1949 and played the BC All-Stars in front of an overflow crowd of 9,800. The game was played a week after a rodeo was staged on the grounds, prompting Newcastle manager George Martin to describe Callister as, \\"...a disgrace to football\\". Rangers were the final big name team to play at Callister in 1954. Baseball The Vancouver Maple Leafs brought professional baseball back to the city for the first time in 15 years in a 5-4 loss to the Tacoma Tigers before 1,500 fans in April 1937.[2] Vancouver baseball history - Stories from the Vancouver Sun and Province from April 28, 1937. The Western International League would leave Con Jones Park at the end of the 1938 season as Jones sold the team to Seattle beer baron Emil Sick. Sick renamed the team the Vancouver Capilanos (after his brewery) and moved the team crosstown to Athletic Park for the 1939 season. Other Sports There were sports other than soccer played at the facility. Field Lacrosse was popular in the Intercity Lacrosse League during the 1920s and 1930s. Rodeos, demolition derby and rugby union were also staged there from time-to-time, although in the case of rugby, Brockton Oval, Vancouver's Athletic Park and UBC's Varsity Stadium (Vancouver) were the standard facilities for the game.

He competed in track and road cycling. Since his retirement, he spends his days browsing the KMart menswear section for slightly ill-fitting cardigans.  Early life  Jennings started cycling at the age of 14 in Preston England riding for Preston Wheelers then later Ribble Valley Cycling Club.  Professional Racing Career  After finishing second in the 1990 National Junior Road Race Jennings attended the Junior Road World Championships in 1990. In 1991 Jennings won two national titles and was selected to compete for Great Britain at the Junior World Championships in the team pursuit, team time trial and individual pursuit events. In 1992, at the age of 19, Jennings was selected to the British Olympic Team and competed in the Team Pursuit Team that came 5th setting a new British record 1992 Olympic Games. In 1993 he joined the Kodak Racing Team and trained with Chris Boardman for the world hour record and competed in the 100km Team Time Trail and 50km Points Race for Great Britain at the World Championships in Norway. Jennings won seven national championships during his senior racing career and medaled in both road and track disciplines. In the early 90s he was recorded at over 100 km/h on a descent during the Isle of Man International Cycling Week, while hung over, before going on to win the race in a bunch sprint (1 lap of the TT circuit). In the 1994 Commonwealth Games he raced for the English road racing team and won a silver medal in the 100 km team time trial setting a new British record of 1hr 56m. During his career Jennings won a total of nine National Championships and represented Great Britain on numerous occasions.  Retirement  Jennings was injured in a drunken skateboard accident in 1995 causing him to retire from professional cycle racing. Jennings demonstrated the same winning mentality by transferring his skills across disciplines to BMX, dirt jumping, mountain biking and even skate boarding. While never reaching the same heights of achievement, which he is never shy of sharing, he enjoys beating friends, colleagues and anyone else slower in events such as the Coppermine Classic mountain bike race near Nelson, New Zealand in February 2013 where he picked up 5th overall and 1st in his Vets category.2013 results by class. coppermine.co.nz He shows his commitment to these disciplines through items such as Vans trainers and phrases such as 'Braaappp!', 'Yo!' and 'dog'.

The hour-long program's debut was announced via a short YouTube clip in January 2013. Following an appearance on KGW's Live at 7 newscast, the show made it into the Top 20 in iTunes listings for Comedy Podcasts. Each episode was recorded in a studio located on the second floor of the Roseway Theater in Portland until the summer of 2014. Later installments were recorded at Killingsworth Abbey in NE Portland. The first episode was posted on February 1, 2013. Beginning on July 15, 2013, the show's weekly recording session was moved to Fridays. New episodes appeared that same day on Welcome to That Whole Thing's website. In the spring of 2014, the show shifted formats. Every episode focused on an individual topic and had a guest host. Topics included dating, the creative industry and politics. Cartoonist Mike Russell, activist Jefferson Smith, and author Daniel H. Wilson were among the guest hosts featured on the podcast. On December 4th, 2014, Webber and Roberts decided to stop producing new episodes of the show, thus ending nine continuous years of co-hosting live radio and podcasts together as a team.

The unit is stationed in Pudong, Shanghai.  History  From left, Chinese military officers Gu Chunhui, Huang Zhenyu, Sun Kailiang, Wang Dong, and Wen Xinyu indicted on cyber espionage charges. =2014 Indictment= On 19 May 2014, the US Department of Justice announced that a Federal grand jury had returned an indictment of five 61398 officers on charges of theft of confidential business information and intellectual property from U.S. commercial firms and of planting malware on their computers.Finkle, J., Menn, J., Viswanatha, J. U.S. accuses China of cyber spying on American companies. Reuters, 20 Nov 2014.Clayton, M. US indicts five in China's secret 'Unit 61398' for cyber-spying. Christian Science Monitor, 19 May 2014 The five are Huang Zhenyu (ÈªÑÊåØÂÆá), Wen Xinyu (ÊñáÊñ∞ÂÆá), Sun Kailiang (Â≠ôÂáØ‰∫Æ), Gu Chunhui (È°æÊò•Êôñ), and Wang Dong (Áéã‰∏ú). Forensic evidence traces the base of operations to a 12-story building off Datong Road in a public, mixed-use area of Pudong in Shanghai. The group is also known by various other names including \\"Advanced Persistent Threat 1\\" (\\"APT1\\"), \\"the Comment group\\" and \\"Byzantine Candor\\", a codename given by US intelligence agencies since 2002. A report by the computer security firm Mandiant stated that PLA Unit 61398 is believed to operate under the 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department (GSD) Third Department (ÊÄªÂèÇ‰∏âÈÉ®‰∫åÂ±Ä) and that there is evidence that it contains, or is itself, an entity Mandiant calls APT1, part of the advanced persistent threat that has attacked a broad range of corporations and government entities around the world since at least 2006. APT1 is described as comprising four large networks in Shanghai, two of which serve the Pudong New Area. It is one of more than 20 APT groups with origins in China. The Third and Fourth Department, responsible for electronic warfare, are believed to comprise the PLA units mainly responsible for infiltrating and manipulating computer networks. The group often compromises internal software \\"comment\\" features on legitimate web pages to infiltrate target computers that access the sites, leading it to be known as \\"the Comment Crew\\" or \\"Comment Group\\". The collective has stolen trade secrets and other confidential information from numerous foreign businesses and organizations over the course of seven years such as Lockheed Martin, Telvent, and other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors. Dell SecureWorks says it believed the group includes the same group of attackers behind Operation Shady RAT, an extensive computer espionage campaign uncovered in 2011 in which more than 70 organizations over a five-year period, including the United Nations, government agencies in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, were targeted. The attacks documented in the summer of 2011 represent a fragment of the Comment group's attacks, which go back at least to 2002, according to incident reports and investigators. FireEye, Inc. alone has tracked hundreds of targets in the last three years and estimates the group has attacked more than 1,000 organizations. Most activity between malware embedded in a compromised system and the malware's controllers takes place during business hours in Beijing's time zone, suggesting that the group is professionally hired, rather than private hackers inspired by patriotic passions.  Public position of the Chinese government  Until 2013, the Government of China has consistently denied that it is involved in hacking. In response to the Mandiant Corporation report about Unit 61398, Hong Lei, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said such allegations were \\"unprofessional\\". In 2013, China changed its position and openly admitted to having secretive cyber warfare units in both the military and the civilian part of the governmenthowever, the details of their activities were left to speculation. As a show of force towards the rest of the global community the Chinese government now openly lists their abilities when it comes to digital spying and network attack capabilities.

History Mossovet Theater was created in 1923 by the theatre entrepreneur S.I.Prokofiev, first as the Theater of Moscow Provincial Council of Trade Unions (MGSPS). In 1925‚Äì1940 it was led by E.O. Lyubimov-Lanskoy and in 1938 changed its name to the Theatre of Moscow City Council (Teatr Moscovskovo soveta) later to be shortened to its present form. The theatre progressed greatly during the reign of actor and director Yury Zavadsky (the prot√©g√© of Konstantin Stanislavski) which started in 1940 and lasted up to 1977. In those years the Mossovet became home to such Soviet stage stars as Vera Maretskaya, Nikolai Mordvinov, Faina Ranevskaya, Lyubov Orlova, Rostislav Plyatt, Boris Ivanov, Georgiy Zhzhonov, Gennady Bortnikov, Mikhail Kozakov, Yury Kuzmenkov. In 1964 the theatre for its artistic achievements was given the Academic Theatre status. With the arrival of Pavel Khomsky in the mid-1970s the Mossovet Theatre started to experiment, using several scenes: In the Foyer, the Small Scene and the (120 seats-strong) Under the Roof scene ‚Äì the latter opened in 1990 with the premier of Pyotr Fomenko's Kaligula.

It was initially located at her private residence before being relocated to some rooms located behind the Remuera Library in Auckland, New Zealand. Corran School was officially established as a Primary School on 28 July 1952. In 1955 the Trust Board purchased land and a building located at 514 Remuera Road from the LDS Church. This house came to be known as \\"Corran House\\". In 1956 the co- educational portion of the private kindergarten was closed, and the school was registered as a secondary school with the New Zealand Education Board. It was officially known as Corran School for Girls until 1967, when the name was shortened to Corran School.

A mixed criticality system is a system containing computer hardware and software that can execute several applications of different criticality, such as safety- critical and non-safety critical, or of different Safety Integrity Level (SIL). Different criticality applications are engineered to different levels of assurance, with high criticality applications being the most costly to design and verify. These kinds of systems are typically embedded in a machine such as an aircraft whose safety must be ensured. Principle Traditional safety-critical systems had to be tested and certified in their entirety to show that they were safe to use. However, many such systems are composed of a mixture of safety-critical and non-critical parts, as for example when an aircraft contains a passenger entertainment system that is isolated from the safety-critical flight systems. Some issues to address in mixed criticality systems include real-time behaviour, memory isolation, data and control coupling. Computer scientists have developed techniques for handling systems which thus have mixed criticality, but there are many challenges remaining especially for multi-core hardware.  Priority and Criticality  Basically, most errors are currently committed when making confusion between priority attribution and criticality management. As priority defines an order between different tasks or messages to be transmitted inside a system, criticality define classes of messages which can have different parameters depending on the current use case. For example, in case of car crash avoidance or obstacle anticipation, camera sensors can suddenly emit messages more often, and so create an overload in the system. That is when we need to make Mixed- Criticality operate : to select messages to absolutely guarantee on the system in these overload cases.

The fuselage consists of five sections, namely the nose cone, equipment bay, fuel tank bay, air intake bay and tail cone. The material for the nose and tail cones are made up of composite material (GFRP), whereas the material of the equipment bay, air intake bay and fuel tank are made up of an aluminum steel alloy. The wings and tail plane of the Abhyas have been derived from the Lakshya by downsizing them, however the wings of the Abhyas are positioned on the upper-side of the body whereas the Lakshya has under-body wings. For propulsion it is fitted with a gas-turbine engine, having a thrust of 25 kg, with an endurance of 30‚Äì45 minutes. Abhyas is GPS-enabled, has an on-board flight control computer and a miss-distance indicator. It is also designed for autonomous flight with the help of an autopilot. Flight Profile The Abhyas is launched from a mobile launcher with the help of two 68 mm booster rockets (being manufactured at ordinance factories). At the end of its launch phase the burnout booster rockets are jettisoned. Thereafter, the main gas-turbine engine powers the vehicle during cruise phase. =Flight testing= DRDO conducted successful flight test of ABHYAS- High-speed Expendable Aerial Target (HEAT) from ITR Balasore in Odisha on 22nd September 2020. Two demonstrator vehicles were successfully test flown. The vehicle can be used as a target for evaluation of various missile systems. Transportation & storage The Abhyas drone has a dedicated box for its transportation and storage (2570 mm * 710 mm *415 mm) made of EPE (Expanded Polyethylene) and with an XLPE (Cross-linked polyethylene) foam material inside. It is weather proof, drop and vibration proof and static load-tested. Usage Abhyas's radar cross-section (RCS) as well as its visual and infrared signatures can be augmented to simulate a variety of aircraft for air-defense weapon practices. It can also function as a jammer platform and decoy. The HEAT system is utilized to do away with the post-launch recovery mode, which is time-consuming and difficult in a scenario as the sea. Development As of January 2013, the proof of concept and pre- project trials were completed. The first experimental launch (without the main engine) of the Abhyas was held at the Chitradurga Aeronautical Test Range on 23 June 2012. The gas turbine engine has been identified and integrated on the Abhyas airframe and its test run with the aircraft fuel system and s-airtake has been completed. The project was sanctioned with an initial DRDO funding of Rs 150 million and the ADE carry out 15 technology demonstrators (TDs) over the next two years. After the acceptance of the prototypes or TDs by the Indian Armed Forces, serial production will start. The Indian Defense Services have also revealed a combined global tender projecting the requirement of 225 HEAT drones.

He served as the last Chancellor of Norway, ending a tradition that had lasted for over 400 years. He was born in Bremerv√∂rde, capital of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. He was a son of Levin von Marschalck (1585-1629), Bremian prince-archiepiscopal Landdrost (1615‚Äì1626) and chancellor of the German Chancery in Copenhagen (1628‚Äì1629). He first went to Denmark when he accompanied his father in the service of King Christian IV of Denmark. He was officially naturalized as Danish nobleman in 1652.

Background QWERTY Tummy was first coined by British consumers group in the context of its study on office hygiene. A survey and chemical analysis of 33 keyboards by scientific experts found among other substances, food poisoning bugs such as e-coli and staphylococcus, comparing the results to those found on lavatory seats and door handles. The findings, according to the experts were supposedly identical to offices all over Britain with some keyboards harboring 150 times the acceptable limit that a human can endure and five times more bacteria than lavatory seats. The QWERTY addition to the term is a direct reference to the layout of a typical keyboard's alphabets which was coined in 1980, as result of the persistent use of the term despite changes in the layout. Importance Apart from the statistics pointing towards an accumulation of 150 times the acceptable level of bacteria for a human and five times the bacteria on an average toilet seat, two keyboards had ‚Äòwarning levels‚Äô of Staphylococcus aureus, and two others had ‚Äòworryingly elevated‚Äô levels of coliforms and enterobacteria, ‚Äòputting users at high risk of becoming ill from contact‚Äô, resulting in Diarrhea, and other stomach-related infections.

It is thought to be an idea inspired by the Kontinental Hockey League. Valery Gazzaev was the head of the committee in charge of the united league. History In 2012 UEFA gave the green light to the BeNe League, a top division of the women's league to include teams from both Belgium and Netherlands. Yevgeni Giner, chairman of CSKA Moscow has stated that he believes that this means that UEFA ‚Äúhas said it will allow the unification of championships‚Äù. The sponsor of the league is to be Gazprom. Gazprom are the owners of the cross-border KHL team SKA Saint Petersburg and Russian Premier League team FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. The Chief Executive Officer of Gazprom, Alexey Miller has suggested that the league could be ready to begin as early as 2014. Miller has also said that the total prize money for the competition would be circa ‚Ç¨1billion Fourteen of the sixteen clubs in the Russian Premier League and a Ukrainian club have attended meetings to discuss the formation of the new competition. The Times have reported that FC Shakhtar Donetsk and FC Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine, and FC BATE Borisov of Belarus, may be interested in the proposal. Terek Grozny did not attend meetings and their vice-president Khaidar Alkhanov described the proposal as a \\"crazy scheme\\" and suggested it is disrespectful to the teams who would be left behind by the larger clubs. FIFA's Sepp Blatter opposes the proposal referring to it as \\"impossible\\". He also said that \\"It goes against the principles of FIFA, therefore FIFA would never support such idea,\\" and \\"We will never reconsider the boundaries of national leagues\\".

It consists of an easy-to-use tool for the graphical editing of statecharts and provides validation, simulation, and source code generators for various target platforms and programming languages. YAKINDU Statechart Tools are available as a standard and as a professional edition, with no-cost licenses for non-commercial resp. academic usage. Users are coming from both industry and academia.  Concepts  YAKINDU Statechart Tools implement the concept of statecharts as invented by David Harel in 1984. Statecharts have been adopted by the UML later. The software can be used to model finite-state machines. Important theoretical models for finite-state machines are Mealy machines and Moore machines. YAKINDU Statechart Tools can be used to model both these types.  Functionality  The main features of YAKINDU Statechart Tools are: * smart combination of textual and graphical modeling * syntactic and semantic validation of the modeled state machines * executable statechart models via the simulation engine * source code generators for Java, C, and C++ (plus beta-state source code generators for Python, Swift, and TypeScript), enabling the integration of generated state machines into custom applications * testing framework SCTUnit * coverage analysis (SCov)  Extensibility  YAKINDU Statechart Tools provide open APIs, allowing for adaptions to specific requirements to a large extent. Not only are the code generators expandable; the developer can also specify his own statechart dialect. For this purpose, the concept of domain-specific statecharts is defined. This makes it possible to use statecharts as reusable language modules.  History  The first version of YAKINDU Statechart Tools was released in 2008 as part of the research project MDA for Embedded. In this research project, model-based development processes for the development of embedded systems based on the Eclipse project were developed. Since mid-2010 the YAKINDU team, consisting mainly of employees of itemis AG, a company in L√ºnen, Germany, has been working on Version 2.0. The first official version was released together with Eclipse version Juno. * Release 2.9 is compatible to Eclipse versions 4.5 (Mars) and 4.6 (Neon). Starting with this release, it is possible to run code generators from the command-line resp. in a continuous integration system. = Introduction of professional edition = In December 2016, itemis released a professional edition of the software for a fee, providing additional functionalities: * Seamless integration with the C programming language * Advanced capabilities for simulating statecharts (breakpoints, snapshots) = Change of licensing model = With release 3.0 of the standard edition in July and of the professional edition in August 2017, itemis changed licensing away from open-source to a proprietary license model. Licenses are still available at no cost for non-commercial users of the standard edition. Academic users can obtain the professional edition for free.

It amended the category of \\"preferential payments\\" for rates, taxes and wages, to take priority over a floating charge in an insolvent company's assets. The Act was passed in broad response to the decision of the House of Lords in . at paragraph 132, per Lord Walker: \\"Saloman v Saloman & Co Ltd was decided by this House on 16 November 1896. WIth remarkable promptness Parliament responded by enacting sections 2 and 3 of the Preference Payments in Bankrtupcy Amendment Act 1897\\". Section 1 of the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Act 1888 first introduced the concept. It was amended by section 2 of the Preferential Payments in Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1897. The provisions were re-enacted in the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908, the Companies Act 1929 and the Companies Act 1948. Unfortunately its provisions were largely ineffective as a floating charge would invariably crystallise into a fixed charge prior to enforcement. It was not until the Insolvency Act 1986 that the definition of floating charge was expanded to include any charge which was created as a fixed charge (ie. irrespective of subsequent crystallisation).

She was well known for her work with Indigenous peoples and for acting as a strong role model for South American girls. Pope John Paul II beatified her in 2004 and Pope Francis canonized her as a saint in mid-2013. Montoya is the first Colombian to be made a saint. Life Saint Laura as a teacher. Sanctuary with her tomb in Medellin. Mar√≠a Laura de Jes√∫s Montoya Upegui was born on 26 May 1874 in Jeric√≥ in the United States of Colombia as the second of three children to Juan de la Cruz Montoya and Dolores Upegui; she was baptized that same day. Her siblings were older sister Carmelina and younger brother Juan de la Cruz; a maternal cousin was Luisa Upegui. During the Colombian Civil War of 1876 her father was killed and the household left poor as a result of this. Therefore she was sent to live with her maternal grandmother; her grandfather was Lucio Upegui. In 1881 the precarious economic condition saw her sent to an orphanage that her maternal aunt Sister Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Upegui managed. This aunt. in 1890. enrolled her at \\"Normale de Institutoras\\" of Medell√≠n to receive training to become a school teacher as a means of having an income to support the financial difficulties her mother faced. She was educated at the Escuela de Esp√≠ritu Santo in Amalfi and then in Medell√≠n. In 1886 she went to live on a farm to care for an ill aunt and it was there that her desire to become a religious began. Montoya graduated as a teacher in 1893. In 1908 she began working with the natives in the Uraba and Sarare regions where she founded the \\"Works of the Indians\\". Montoya wanted to become a cloistered Carmelite nun but felt growing within her the desire to spread the Gospel to those who had never met Jesus Christ. Montoya wanted to eliminate the existing racial discrimination and to sacrifice herself in order to bring them Christ's love and teachings. On 14 May 1917, she started the \\"Congregation of Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Virgin Mary and Saint Catherine of Siena\\". She left Medell√≠n with four other women and went to Dabeiba to live among the native Indians. Even though this new order had the support of the Bishop of Santa Fe de Antioquia it was criticized even within Christian groups. Montoya died after a prolonged illness on 21 October 1949 in Medell√≠n in Colombia. The last nine years of her life were lived in a wheelchair due to this. Her order at present operates in a total of nineteen countries throughout the Americas as well as in Africa and Europe. Sainthood Priests venerating her relics in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Medellin. The process for sanctification opened in Medell√≠n in an informative process that Archbishop Tulio Botero Salazr opened on 24 June 1963 and later closed on 14 May 1964; theologians later collected and approved her spiritual writings on 22 June 1973 after assessing that such writings were in line with doctrine. An apostolic process was then held there from 16 August 1976 to 19 December 1977 while this and the informative process received validation from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 22 January 1982. Montoya became titled as a Servant of God under Pope Paul VI on 5 April 1976 with the formal introduction of the cause. The postulation submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 1988 which allowed for theologians to issue their assent to the cause on 12 December 1989 and for the C.C.S. to also approve it on 23 October 1990. Montoya became titled as Venerable on 22 January 1991 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that the late religious led a model life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for beatification was located and investigated in the diocese of its origin and received C.C.S. validation on 25 January 2002 in Rome while a medical board later approved this miracle on 17 October 2002; theologians followed suit on 1 April 2003 as did the C.C.S. on 3 June 2003. John Paul II approved this healing to be a credible miracle attributed to Montoya's intercession on 7 July 2003 and later beatified her on 25 April 2004 in Saint Peter's Square. The beatification miracle involved the 1994 cure of a woman (aged 86) from uterine cancer. The second miracle ‚Äì and the one required for full sanctification ‚Äì was investigated and later received validation on 7 November 2008. The medical board granted their assent to it on 14 June 2012 while theologians likewise approved it on 12 October 2012; the C.C.S. issued their own approval on 10 December 2012. Pope Benedict XVI approved this on 20 December 2012 and scheduled her canonization at a consistory on 11 February 2013 ‚Äì which included the pontiff's resignation. The retired pope's successor Pope Francis canonized her as a saint on 12 May 2013. The canonization miracle involves the healing of Doctor Carlos Eduardo Restrepo who was suffering from lupus as well as kidney damage and muscular degeneration. The doctor was said to be cured after requesting the intercession of the then-beatified Montoya. The postulator at the time of Montoya's canonization was Dr. Silvia M√≥nica Correale.

Written by Howard Irving Young, Edmund L. Hartmann, Albert J. Cohen, and Jack Harvey, the film is about an overworked advertising executive who is being pursued romantically by his former fianc√©e, a successful perfume magnate, who is also the ad agency's largest client. While visiting a new client‚Äîa psychiatrist and author‚Äîto discuss a proposed ad campaign, his life becomes further complicated when the new client turns out to be a beautiful woman, who decides to treat his nervous condition. Plot At Montgomery Advertising in New York City, Duke Crawford (Robert Cummings) is having trouble handling the account of cosmetics manufacturer Michele Bennett (Anna Sten), one of the company's most important clients‚Äîand his former fianc√©e. Still determined to win him back, Michele refuses to sign a contract until Duke reciprocates her affection. When Duke threatens to quit Michele's account, his boss James Montgomery (Harry Antrim) assigns him to do the book promotion for a new client, a nerve psychologist named J.O. Loring. While taking a taxi to the psychologist's office, Duke shaves with an electric razor he invented, but his nervousness and stress result in leaving half his mustache intact. When he arrives at the client's office, Duke discovers that J.O. Loring is in fact an attractive woman named Jo (Hedy Lamarr). Staring at the half a mustache, Jo mistakes him for one of her mentally disturbed patients. Determines to prove to himself that he is anesthetized from women, he kisses the doctor. Jo reacts by recommending that he read her book on stress relief titled Let's Live a Little. Later that night, Duke is unable to fall asleep. The next morning, after Duke makes an appointment to see Jo as her patient, Jo advises him that if he wants his former fianc√©e to sign the contract, he must wine and dine her. Following her advice, Duke arranges a date with Michele at a nightclub. Wanting to observe the encounter for scientific reasons, Jo arrives at the nightclub with her stuffy surgeon boyfriend, Dr. Richard Field (Robert Shayne). When Michele notices that Duke and Jo are falling in love, and when she is served a cake with an advertising contract inside instead of a marriage license, she throws his drink at him and storms out of the nightclub. Duke is reduced to a nerve-wracked state‚Äîrepeating ad slogans over and over. Feeling responsible for Duke's psychological condition, Jo takes him to a lakeside lodge for a rest cure. One moonlit night, while the two are on the lake in a canoe, Duke kisses Jo passionately, proving to himself that he is cured of his misogyny. Duke soon returns to New York, rejuvenated by his love for Jo, and organizes a successful radio ad campaign for her book. During one radio interview, Jo discusses one of her recent patients who suffered from a nervous breakdown brought on by a failed relationship. She describes how she helped him recover by pretending to fall in love with him to help him in a transference of his affections. When Duke hears the interview, he becomes angry at being depicted as a guinea pig in a love experiment. Duke resolves to forget Jo and pursue Michele. Soon after, Jo reads the newspaper announcement of Duke's engagement to Michele. Unable to think about anything but Duke, Jo begins to have a nervous breakdown of her own. As Michele and Duke's wedding day approaches, Jo's colleague Dr. Field takes her to the lakeside lodge in an effort to cure her of her obsession with Duke. Even after he proposes to her, however, she can see only Duke's face, and rejects him. Meanwhile, as Michele tastelessly redecorates Duke's apartment, he gets a telephone call from Field, who defiantly announces that Jo is now in his care. Duke leaves Michele and drives to the lakeside lodge, where he finds Jo, embraces her, and convinces her that his kisses are real. Cast * Hedy Lamarr as Dr. J.O. Loring * Robert Cummings as Duke Crawford * Anna Sten as Michele Bennett * Robert Shayne as Dr. Richard Field * Mary Treen as Miss Adams * Harry Antrim as James Montgomery * Norma Varden as Nurse Brady Production Let's Live a Little was the first film produced by Robert Cummings and Eugene Frenke and their company, United California Productions (UCP). Hedy Lamarr signed in December 1947. UCP originally arranged for the film to be financed and released through United Artists but this was eventually terminated and they did a deal instead with a new company, Eagle-Lion. UCP had Douglas Sirk under contract as director but because he was busy on another film they hired Richard Wallace to do Let's Live a Little. Anna Sten was married to Eugene Frenke. Filming took place in March 1948. According to an article, the film cost $1,100,000 to produce. Stanley Cortez was meant to be cinematographer but left the film during filming. It was reported in the trade press this was because Lamarr objected to the focus being given to Anna Sten over her. Hedy Lamarr said it was because she was unhappy with his work. Frencke said it was because Cortez was sick. Cummings announced a slate of independent productions to follow but was unable to obtain finance. Radio Version A radio version of the film was broadcast on Screen Directors' Playhouse on January 16, 1949 and starred Robert Cummings and Betty Lou Gerson. The film was later reissued in the United States with the title Hell Breaks Loose. Reception Let's Live a Little received mixed reviews, with most critics reserving their positive responses for Lamarr. Following the previews on October 21, 1948, the reviewer in Daily Variety wrote, \\"Lamarr is a knockout!\\"Shearer 2010, p. 241. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Philip K. Scheuer wrote, \\"Miss Lamarr is her customary self‚Äîvague, cool, and bewitching.\\" Despite earning some money, Let's Live a Little turned out to be the only film ever produced by United California Productions.Shearer 2010, p. 242. For the film itself, most of the positive responses were far more reserved.

Academic career Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mirazon Lahr graduated in Biology from the University of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. She later earned a Masters and PhD in Biological Anthropology from the University of Cambridge, following which she was elected to a Junior Research Fellowship at Clare College. She was then an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biology of University of S√£o Paulo (1995‚Äì98), before returning to Cambridge in 1999 as a lecturer in Biological Anthropology and Fellow of Clare College. Mirazon Lahr was promoted to University Reader in Human Evolutionary Biology in 2005. In 2001 Mirazon Lahr, with co-founder Robert Foley, established the Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies (LCHES) at the University of Cambridge, with funding from the Wellcome Trust and the Leverhulme Trust. The Centre was designed to provide a home for the Duckworth Collection, and up-to-date laboratories and facilities to support research in human evolution which integrated genetics, anthropology, and other fields. Mirazon Lahr was awarded the Phillip Leverhulme Prize in 2004. Research Lahr's research is in human evolution, and ranges across human and hominin morphology, prehistory and genetics. Her early work provided a test of the Multiregional Hypothesis of modern humans origins, and underlined much of the argument against models of regional continuity in traits between archaic and modern humans. This research expanded into a fuller consideration of the origins of modern human diversity, published as a book in 1996 - The Evolution of Human Diversity - by Cambridge University Press.Lahr, M. M. (1996) The evolution of modern human diversity, Cambridge: CUP. Her subsequent research continues to explore human diversity from a number of different perspectives and methodological approaches, and includes archaeology, palaeobiology, genomics and human biology. She and Robert Foley were the first to propose a ‚Äòsouthern route‚Äô for humans out of Africa, and for human diversity to be the product of multiple dispersals as well as local adaptation. She has led field projects in the Amazon, the Solomon Islands, India, the Central Sahara and Kenya, the last two focusing on issues to do with the origins and dispersals of modern humans in Africa. Mirazon Lahr is currently the director of the IN-AFRICA Project, an Advanced Investigator Award from the European Research Council (ERC) to examine the role of east Africa in modern human origins. As part of the IN-AFRICA Project, she has led the excavations at the site of Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, establishing the existence of prehistoric warfare among nomadic hunter- gatherers 10,000 years ago. She was recently interviewed alongside Richard and Meave Leakey as part of the documentary 'Bones of Turkana', a National Geographic Special about palaeoanthropology and human evolution in the Turkana Basin, Kenya.

He has represented the South West Saint Catherine constituency in the Parliament of Jamaica since 2002. Career=Overview= Warmington was first elected to Parliament in the 2002 elections. In the 2007 elections, he faced off against Dennis Jones of the People's National Party, winning by a sizeable 10,488 votes to Jones' 7,244. In February 2011, it came to light that Warmington had been a U.S. citizen at the time of his 2007 nomination, meaning that he was constitutionally ineligible to sit in Parliament; this was part of a widespread scandal in Jamaica involving MPs on both sides of the aisle, including Daryl Vaz, Michael Stern, Shahine Robinson, and Gregory Mair of the JLP and Sharon Hay-Webster and Ian Hayles of the PNP. Warmington had renounced U.S. citizenship some time after, but in light of the revelations, he submitted his letter of resignation on 8 March 2011, and a by-election for his seat was scheduled for 4 April; a truce between the PNP and the JLP meant that Warmington would run unopposed. He quickly ran into controversy soon after his resignation when he told a CVM- TV anchorwoman to \\"go to hell\\" during a live programme; the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association and the International Federation of Journalists condemned his outburst, while Jamaican women's groups called on Bruce Golding not to permit Warmington to run in the 4 April by-election. Despite the controversy, the by-election saw Warmington returned to his seat, though Golding declined to reappoint him State Minister for Water and Housing. Warmington faced a bigger challenge later that year in the general elections in December. Redistribution carried out in 2010 had been expected to harm Warmington's chances of re-election: a new seat for Saint Catherine Parish had been added, and the Sydenham division and parts of the Church Pen division, both JLP strongholds which contributed heavily to Warmington's 2007 re- election, were transferred to the new constituency. However, the PNP also faced internal tensions over the best candidate to challenge Warmington: former Senator Keste Miller or caretaker-candidate Anthony Ewbanks. In the end, Warmington faced off against Ewbanks and defeated him, though by a smaller margin than in his previous election: 9,096 to 8,184. =Contracting scandal= In 2011, a report by the Office of the Contractor-General alleged irregularities in the Government's award of millions of dollars of contracts to Strathairn Construction Company, a firm in which Warmington was allegedly a director and shareholder. Warmington responded angrily to the accusations, calling Contractor-General Greg Christie an \\"overzealous idiot\\" and a \\"mental case\\". After a protracted investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions found that two other directors of SCCL had made misrepresentations about Warmington's financial interest in the company, and on that basis announced that no charges would be filed against Warmington. When the news went public, Warmington withdrew his earlier apology to Christie and repeated his description of Christie as a \\"mental case\\" for emphasis. =Disputes with JLP= Warmington has had a number of high-profile public disputes with his party over his four decades of membership. In 2006, he resigned from his position as Chairman of the JLP's Area Council Two, accusing the JLP leadership of disregarding the party's constitution. In November 2012, he decried irregularities in the nomination of candidates for party leadership positions and went as far as to file an application for an injunction in the Supreme Court; however, he withdrew the application just hours before the case was heard. He stated in media interviews later that week that he had withdrawn the application on the strength of assurances from top party members that the election would not go forward; nevertheless, the JLP held its election as scheduled, and Warmington continued to speak out publicly about the matter. Personal life Warmington was born in Browns Hall, Saint Catherine. He did his early education at Browns Hall All-Age School and Saint Andrew Technical High School before going on to the College of Arts, Science, and Technology (CAST; today the University of Technology, Jamaica). He became involved in politics early on in his life as the Vice-President of Young Jamaica and the Vice-President of the Student Council at CAST from 1974 to 1978.

History In 1943 heavy fighting occurred between the partly communist-led EAM and the centrist/republican (EKKA, EDES) and right-wing/monarchist (PAO, ESEA) resistance groups. The main reason for this conflict was a series of activities of EAM, which attempted to put all other groups under its control. There were also ideology issues that created hostile sentiments. The EAM promoted the establishment of a socialist state, while the others preferred a state with free market and a multi-party parliament. The EAM also accused all other groups (without exception) for being traitorous and collaborating with the Germans. Local low-intensity clashes escalated to full civil war, with the ELAS (Greek People's Liberation Army, armed branch of EAM) attacking the other partisans who were supported by the Greek government-in-exile. In the Peloponnese ELAS was the strongest partisan army compared to a few nationalist groups active in Elis, Messenia and Laconia. These small organisations were, sooner or later, either absorbed by ELAS or destroyed. Several thousands of nationalist partisans and their supporters were captured, along with actual collaborators of the Germans from the Security Battalions. It was common practice for ELAS and the OPLA (communist secret police) to arrest not only the opponent partisans, but their families too. In communist-controlled mountainous regions (such as districts of Achaia, Argolis and Messenia) small concentration camps were established. One of the most notorious concentrations camps was the Monastery of Saint George, near the village of Kalivia Feneou in Corinthia. The ELAS partisans killed the 6 monks and turned the monastery cellars into a prison (March 1943). Unlike other camps, hostages did not stay for long there as after a few days they were taken to several nearby cliffs and other isolated sites, where they were executed. The executions were supervised by Vaggelis Zegos (nicknamed \\"Stathes\\" or \\"Triantafyllos\\"), representative of the Peloponesian Office of the EAM. Zegos was also in charge of all operations against anticommunists and non-communists in Argolis, Corinthia and northern Arcadia. In order to terrorise the rural populations, he used to arrest 5-10% of the inhabitants of each village. Killings in Feneos carried on until June 1944. When ELAS was defeated by joint Greek and British troops in the December 1944 clashes in Athens, all communist organisations were disarmed (though several thousands of firearms were kept hidden and used in the \\"third round\\" of the war 1946-1949) and the newly created National Guard restored government control in most of the countryside, including Feneos. Rumors before civil war Rumors spread by locals and right-wing newspapers claimed that ELAS had arrested and executed 5-7,000 or even 13,000 people. In fact, less than 4,000 bodies were found in the area (400 in the infamous \\"Hole of Feneos\\" and the rest in the ravine of Prophet Elias, Saint Nicolas in the White Rock, near the Hadrian aqueduct of Stymphalia etc.), out of whom 1,800 were recognised. The government built a monument, while the names of the recognised victims were written on the walls of the monastery. Ceremonies in memory are held every year with the presence of local authorities.

It signed off June 23, 2004 to allow WFDF/910 to increase power. WFRO's programming was at times simulcast on WFRO-FM, which continues. History For much of its existence, WFRO had been a combination AM and FM station, with FM first going on the air in 1946, and AM (at 900 kHz) going on the air three years later. Both stations simulcast each other for a portion of the broadcast day, breaking away for separate programming during the midday hours, with AM concentrating more on information and talk, and FM focusing on music. For many years, WFRO AM broadcast a full-service MOR format heavy on local news and information; WFRO-FM played beautiful music during non- simulcast dayparts. AM 900's directional signal allowed WFRO programming to be heard clearly throughout much of southeastern Michigan (including the metropolitan Detroit area) and southwestern Ontario in addition to Ohio's North Coast region. By the 1990s, WFRO and WFRO-FM were simulcasting each other for most of the broadcast day, and WFRO's music format had evolved into a more contemporary mix of AC and adult-appeal CHR hits, but the full-service emphasis remained. The station was founded by Wolfe Broadcasting Company, which controlled the station until 2001, when both stations were sold separately to two different owners. BAS Broadcasting purchased WFRO-FM, while Disney/ABC purchased the license to WFRO, but not to run it as a separate entity. ABC purchased the license as part of an initiative to move recently purchased AM 910 WFDF in Flint, Michigan to Farmington Hills (in the Detroit market).The AM Stations of Flint, Michigan The move was made to allow AM 910 to broadcast at an increased daytime power of 50,000 watts, up substantially from 5,000 watts.

It determines which member states' courts have jurisdiction. History EU member states concluded the Convention on Insolvency Proceedings in 1995, however it never entered into force as ratification by all member states was required and the United Kingdom did not sign within the timelines specified in the Convention. Content The EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 was passed on 29 May 2000 and came into effect on 31 May 2002. It replaced the substance of the 1995 Convention. The Regulation applies between all member states of the European Union, with the exception of Denmark which has an opt- out from the EU's Area of freedom, security and justice, and focuses upon creating a framework for the commencement of proceedings and for the automatic recognition and co-operation between the different member states. Unusually for a European regulation, the EC Insolvency Regulation does not seek to harmonise insolvency laws between the different member states. Like the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, the EC Regulation also employs the concept of a centre of main interest (or \\"COMI\\"). The definition of the COMI is left to member states in their implementation of the Regulation, but paragraph (13) of the preamble states: 'The \\"centre of main interests\\" should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.' If the COMI of an entity is outside of the European Union then the insolvency proceedings are not subject to the Regulation.Re the Arena Corporation Ltd [2003] EWHC 3032 (Ch.), affirmed on appeal ([2004] EWCA Civ 371). In relation to companies there is a presumption that the registered office will be the COMI of the company, but this presumption can be (and often is) rebutted.Re AIM Underwriting Agencies [2004] EWHC Civ 2114; Re TXU Europe German Finance BV [2005] BCC 90. The EC Regulation does not define insolvency, but it does define insolvency proceedings as being 'collective insolvency proceedings which entail the partial or total divestment of a debtor and the appointment of a liquidator'.Article 1(1). Article 3 divides proceedings into main proceedings and territorial proceedings. The main proceedings are accorded extraterritorial effect throughout the European Union. One of the concerns which has been expressed in relation to the EC Regulation is that (other than a reference to the European Court of Justice) there is no mechanism for determining which set of proceedings are to be regarded as the main proceedings if two or more jurisdictions claims that their own proceedings are the main proceedings.Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd (Case C-341/04), [2006] ECR 1-701 An amendment to the regulation was approved in 2015, which again applied to all EU member states except Denmark.

ATMs) comprise tissue resident macrophages present in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue apart from adipocytes is composed of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of cells including preadipocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and variety of immune cells. The latter ones are composed of mast cells, eosinophils, B cells, T cells and macrophages. The number of macrophages within adipose tissue differs depending on the metabolic status. As discovered by Rudolph Leibel and Anthony Ferrante et al. in 2003 at Columbia University, the percentage of macrophages within adipose tissue ranges from 10% in lean mice and humans up to 50% in extremely obese, leptin deficient mice and almost 40% in obese humans. Increased number of adipose tissue macrophages correlates with increased adipose tissue production of proinflammatory molecules and might therefore contribute to the pathophysiological consequences of obesity (e.g. insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes). M1/M2 macrophage polarization Macrophages are remarkably plastic cells which in order to adapt to different tissue microenvironments can assume a range of different phenotypes. Accordingly, macrophages can exhibit either pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotypes and are routinely classified into M1 (classically activated) phenotype and M2 (alternatively activated) phenotype. According to this classification, macrophages acquire M1 phenotype following in vitro stimulation with interferon gamma (IFN-Œ≥) alone or in combination with TLR ligands (e.g. lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) whereas macrophages acquire M2 phenotype after in vitro exposure to IL-4 and IL-13. M1 macrophages secrete high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Œ±), IL-6, IL-1Œ≤) and generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species such as nitric oxide via activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Conversely, M2 macrophages activate arginase 1 (Arg1) that blocks iNOS activity and therefore inhibits nitric oxide production. They also secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-10, TGF-Œ≤, IL-4) essential for inflammatory response resolution. M1 macrophages are microbicidal and tumoricidal, and stimulate adaptive immune response. M2 macrophages are associated with anti-inflammatory and homeostatic functions linked to wound healing. However, in this classification system, M1 and M2 macrophages are regarded as two extreme phenotypes. For example, macrophages stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13 are defined as M2a, whereas macrophages stimulated with LPS and apoptotic cells as M2b and macrophages stimulated with IL-10, transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) or glucocorticoids as M2c. In adipose tissue, distinction between M1 and M2 macrophage polarization can be monitored by assessing the expression of selected markers. Macrophages displaying M1 phenotype have been characterized by expression of F4/80, CD11c and iNOS whereas macrophages displaying M2 phenotype have been characterized by expression of F4/80, CD301 and Arg1. Adiopose tissue macrophage polarization was summarized in a recent review article Appari M et al., et al. Adipose tissue macrophages and obesity Leptin-deficient (ob/ob), severely obese mouse (on the left) compared to lean one (on the right) and characterized by increased number of adipose tissue macrophages associated with obesity-related conditions like insulin resistance. Increased recruitment of macrophages into adipose tissue is multifactoral. Adipocyte cell death observed within pathologically expanding adipose tissue is one of the factors. Macrophages are specialized phagocytes that remove dying or dead cells or cellular debris. Within adipose tissue, presence of dead adipocytes is a hallmark of obesity. Macrophages surrounding dying or dead adipocytes form crown-like structures (CLSs), identified by the absence of perilipin staining. In addition to increased number of macrophages within adipose tissue, obesity also induces a phenotypic switch in these cells toward the classically activated (M1) phenotype. Moreover, expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Œ± is mostly derived from macrophages rather than adipocytes. It has been proposed that their presence contributes to the development of insulin resistance and diabetes type-2. Adipose tissue macrophages isolated from obese patients express growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and proteolytic enzymes involved in the regulation of tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastatic spread, and resemble macrophages present in tumor stroma. Adipose tissue macrophages and weight loss Acute weight loss is also associated with increased, yet transient recruitment of macrophages into adipose tissue. However the recruited macrophages do not promote inflammatory response but rather regulate lipolysis. Recruited macrophages are characterized by higher expression of scavenger receptors (i.e. CD36 and macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1)) and lipid-handling genes (i.e. adipose differentiation-related protein (Adfp), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (Fabp4), ApoE and ABCA1), and increased accumulation of Oil Red O-positive lipids. In this case, release of free fatty acids (FFAs) serves as a signal for macrophage recruitment. It has been shown in mice that adipose tissue macrophages regulate the age-related reduction of adipocyte lipolysis during ageing by lowering the bioavailability of noradrenaline. Inhibition of MAOA, an enzyme known to degrade noradrenaline, reversed the reduction in noradrenaline concentration and restored lipolysis in mice. Adipose tissue macrophages and tumor growth Macrophages within tumor stroma, so called tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumor growth and metastasis. Tumor-associated macrophage infiltration correlates with poor prognosis in patients with breast, cervix, bladder and brain cancers. Pathophysiological interaction between tumor-associated macrophages and surrounding cells, such as endothelial cells promote tumor progression. In 1971, Judah Folkman proposed that angiogenesis plays essential role in tumor growth. Macrophages secrete many pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), TNF-Œ±, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-1 and IL-6. Additionally it has been shown that adipose tissue surrounding certain tumors or metastases to the lymph nodes, which are embedded in adipose tissue, fuels tumor growth by serving as a depot for adipose tissue macrophages that stimulate angiogenesis and resemble TAMs. References * Obesity Immune system Macrophages ","title":"Adipose tissue macrophages"},{"id":"38572944","text":"Mark Humphrey (born 1970) is an English interior designer and installation artist.

A carpenter by trade, Luther was renowned in his time for his oratory skills and early work to organize workers into trade unions in the New England area. He was a key player in Rhode Island's Dorr Rebellion of 1842, where the working people of Rhode Island took up arms in an ill-fated crusade to expand voting to non- property holding men. Later in life, he was arrested and institutionalized after trying to rob a bank in the name of American President James K. Polk. He died in the Brattleboro Asylum on April 29, 1863. In 2001, the Rhode Island Heritage Society inducted Luther into its Hall of Fame in recognition of his pioneering work on behalf of union organizing in Rhode Island. Early life Seth Luther was born in 1795 the son of a revolutionary war veteran Thomas Luther and his wife Rebecca. In 1815, Luther was baptized and became a member of the First Baptist Church of Providence, the same Church founded by the Founder of Providence, Roger Williams. Two years later in 1817, Luther left Rhode Island and traveled to the frontier of the young country, providing him with stories that would punctuate his speeches on the rights of working people throughout the years to come. When he returned to Providence, and in July 1824, he was voted out of membership in the First Baptist Church on a charge of \\"Disorderly Walking. \\" \\"It is the first duty of an American citizen to hate injustice in all its forms.\\" During most of the 1830s, Luther worked for a variety of emerging workingmen's trade unions in the New England area as an organizer, pamphleteer, and orator. Three notable speeches of the decade are his \\"Address on the Right of Free Suffrage\\" delivered in Providence, Rhode Island, 1833; \\"An Address on the Origins of Avarice\\" delivered at a union meeting in Charlestown, Massachusetts, 1834, and; \\"An Address before the Mechanics and Working-Men of the City of Brooklyn of the Sixtieth Anniversary of American Independence\\". His speeches were also littered with biblical references. The \\"Avarice\\" address highlights the contradictions for Luther in the emerging capitalism of the American economy and the professed Christian ideals of the country. Echoing the Gospel of Mathew, Chapter 6, verse 24, Luther says to his audience: \\"For we have seen many who profess to have their treasure in heaven, grasping with intense desire the world, the world, the world; and it seems that the nearer they get to the earth, the closer they hug it. Such persons give no evidence whatever of being what they profess to be, followers of him who has said, 'Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. \\" In his 1836 \\"Mechanics\\" address, Luther references the Old Testament prophet Micah (See Micah 6:8) when he tells his audience: \\"It is the first duty of an American citizen to hate injustice in all its forms; then he we be prepared to do justly, love mercy, and walk as he ought to walk in the sight of God and Man. \\"  \\"Peaceably if we can. Forcibly if we must!\\" The terrible working conditions of American workers were not the only thing Luther directed his organizing focus towards. The noted historian Louis Hartz described in a 1940 biographical essay on Luther how Rhode Island was \\"a place and time suitable indeed for the growth of a working-class radical\\" because \\"parallel with his attack on the social abuses of the new capitalism ran Luther's militant drive to reform the last outpost of reaction in the sphere of suffrage, his own state of Rhode Island.\\" Property ownership was still a test for voting, disqualifying masses of workers from the ballot box. This led Luther to combine his worker organizing efforts with the efforts of suffrage activists across the state of Rhode Island. In 1841, while delivering a speech in Newport, Luther is reported to have delivered his most famous slogan to assembled crowd. He told the audience that the vote would be extended \\"Peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must,\\" which the New Age Constitution and Advocate at the time reported was met with hissing from the \\"lordly landholders and noted aristocrats.\\" Participation in the Dorr Rebellion Luther's 1841 remarks foreshadowed what came to be known as the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island in 1842. Luther was part of Thomas Dorr's ill-fated attempt to seize power in Rhode Island by attacking the state arsenal. When the cannon the Dorr forces were attempting to use in the insurrection failed to fire, the forces of the uprising scattered. Luther was eventually captured and imprisoned. He made an unsuccessful escape attempt by setting his prison bedding on fire, but was eventually released in 1843 by a conservative government eager to put the insurrection behind them. \\" Last years After his release from prison, Luther embarked on a speaking tour about the rebellion and about the Ten-Hour Movement, but by 1846, his mental state was failing \\". After writing a letter to President James K. Polk offering his services in the Mexican War, Luther was arrested for robbing a bank in the words of one local newspaper \\"demanded a thousand dollars in the name of President Polk.\\" \\". He was committed to an institution in East Cambridge, moved to the Dexter Asylum in Providence, the Butler Hospital, and eventually to the Vermont Asylum (now the Brattleboro Retreat ) where he died in 1863. He was buried in an unmarked grave. See also * Stephen Simpson (writer), outspoken contemporary of Seth, also critical of labor abuses, especially in connection with monopolies and banking practices.

It is thought to have been caused by a meteor about wide which struck during the Middle Ordovician Period, circa 470 million years ago.  Description  The crater is estimated to be in diameter, covered by the Winneshiek Shale. There is no surface evidence of the impact, as the Winneshiek Shale is more than below the bottom of the Upper Iowa River. The impact event, equivalent to 1,000 megatons of TNT, did not appear to penetrate the Earth's mantle, but it did push down the underlying Ordovician and Cambrian bedrock several hundred feet. It may be one of several Middle Ordovician meteors that fell roughly simultaneously 469 million years ago, part of a proposed Ordovician meteor event, including three confirmed impact craters: Rock Elm crater in Wisconsin, Slate Islands crater in Lake Superior, and Ames crater in Oklahoma. Pentecopterus decorahensis The Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian) Winneshiek Lagerst√§tte sediments that filled in the crater contained a wide variety of unusual fauna.

It is the largest and most sensitive survey of the Galactic plane to date.  Introduction  Most of the advances in pulsar astronomy were due to the discovery of new objects. A major increase in search sensitivity has already started a new era of discovery at the Arecibo Observatory. This increase in search sensitivity is due first and foremost by the ALFA receiver and the pulsar surveys it makes possible, which are now being carried by the Pulsar Consortium using the Arecibo 305 m radio telescope. Preliminary estimates (see below) indicate that the Arecibo Galactic plane survey using ALFA could find many hundreds of new pulsars. As of November 2019, the survey had already discovered a total of 192 new pulsars. The survey is targeting low Galactic latitudes (|b|‚â§5¬∞) in the Galactic longitude ranges accessible by the Arecibo telescope (32¬∞ and the first eccentric binary millisecond pulsar in the Galactic plane, PSR J1903+0327 In addition, PALFA has produced the first pulsar discovery by volunteer computing, PSR J2007+2722, through the Einstein@Home distributed computing project. The discoveries include all known varieties of rotation- powered neutron stars: millisecond pulsars, relativistic binaries, mildly recycled, normal, and energetic young pulsars. Fourteen of the ALFA objects have been identified through their intermittent single pulses and are likely rotating radio transients (RRATs). The rest have been discovered via blind periodicity searches. Follow-up radio timing observations are carried out through a coordinated effort between Arecibo, Jodrell Bank, Greenbank, and Nan√ßay to obtain phase-connected timing solutions for these pulsars. The first fast radio burst to be discovered by a telescope other than the Parkes radio telescope was identified in a PALFA pointing in the Galactic anti-center.. This was the first repeating fast radio burst ever discovered. The PALFA survey is carried out by an international consortium of scientists from the United States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Australia, and France. The Principal Investigator of the PALFA survey is Prof. Victoria Kaspi of McGill University. Sky map in Galactic coordinates showing (in green) the portions of the Galactic plane being targeted by the PALFA survey. This region corresponds to most of the Galactic plane visible with the Arecibo telescope. The dots correspond to known pulsars, their color indicates their inferred distance.  Data acquisition  With ALFA, 47 pointings are needed to cover one square degree, compared to about 330 pointings needed to cover one square degree with similar density with a single-pixel feed. Initially, the survey used the Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processors (WAPPs) to detect the signal from ALFA's seven beams. These cover 100 MHz of band (with dual polarization capability), initially centered at 1420 MHz and now at 1440 MHz. For search purposes, 256-channel spectra are produced every 64 microseconds. In 2009, the survey transitioned to new and improved back-ends, the Mock polyphase filterbank spectrometers, which are capable of covering 300 MHz (from 1225 MHz to 1525 MHz, the bandwidth covered by ALFA) for each of the seven beams (see detailed technical specifications here). This has led to greatly increased search sensitivity and better means to deal with all the radio frequency interference.  Data processing and storage  Many of the detections to date have been made with a quick reduction package that allows us to find pulsars almost in real time. This is made possible by reducing the spectral and time resolution by a factor of 16, and using a computer cluster, the Arecibo Signal Processor to search for pulsars in the data. This is a nice and quick way of detecting slow pulsars, but the sensitivity to fast pulsars is severely degraded. Re-processing these data with full resolution is, computationally, a very challenging task but is essential for detecting many fast (both young and recycled) pulsars so far hidden by Galactic plasma. It is expected that, over the next several years, this survey will generate over 1000 Terabytes of data. The data is stored at the Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing. The full-resolution raw data is processed independently by three software pipelines. The Cornell University pipeline has conducted standard periodicity search and single-pulse search without doing an acceleration search. It has been run on all WAPP data archived at the Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing and has provided 2.5 million signal candidates. Winnowing of this vast set of candidates is currently under way. Galactic location of the new P-ALFA pulsar survey discoveries. The center of the Galaxy is indicated by the center of the coordinates, the position of the Solar System is indicated by the red dot on the left. The PALFA search areas are indicated in light blue. The dots indicate pulsars, this time colored according to their DM. The new PALFA discoveries are indicated by the larger dots. The second pipeline is based on PRESTO, a large suite of pulsar search and analysis software developed by Scott Ransom. It employs a Fourier-domain acceleration search technique, which compensates for the loss of detection sensitivity in a traditional periodicity search due to a rapidly changing frequency of the periodic pulsar signal. Such frequency modulation can occur, for instance, due to a pulsar's orbital motion in a compact binary. This approach thus significantly boosts sensitivity to binary pulsars. The PRESTO pipeline is run on dedicated clusters at several institutions that participate in the ALFA survey, producing over 3 million signal candidates. Over the past two years, the Guillimin supercomputer, managed by McGill University as part of CLUMEQ, has been processing most of the PALFA data with PRESTO. Since March 2009, part of the Einstein@Home computing power is used to analyze PALFA data. The Einstein@Home algorithm is particularly sensitive to radio pulsars in tight binary systems (as short as 11 minutes), with a phase-space coverage that is complementary to that of the PRESTO pipeline. To date, it has re-detected 123 previously known radio pulsars as well as several previously unknown pulsars. The data processed thus far has revealed that the radio frequency interference (RFI) environment at Arecibo significantly affects the detection threshold of the survey, creating unforeseen challenges in identifying the many weak pulsars that are likely lurking in the data. To address this, the PALFA consortium is actively developing novel techniques for identification, mitigation, and excision of RFI. We are also implementing a variety of heuristics as well as machine learning algorithms for identifying real pulsars among the millions of signal candidates, most of which appear to be due to RFI. The inevitable growth in the incidence and variety of man-made RFI suggests that this problem will likely be important for all future radio pulsar surveys. Sky coverage map of the PALFA survey as of July 8, 2014  Outreach efforts  The Arecibo Remote Command Center (ARCC) at the University of Texas at Brownsville, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, and Franklin & Marshall College is currently engaged in searching for radio pulsars in PALFA data. ARCC is an integrated research/education facility that allows students at the high school and undergraduate level to be directly involved with the research at the Arecibo telescope. Web based tools have been developed so that students can rank the pulsar candidates created by the PRESTO analysis.

The idea behind all University Air Squadrons is to allow potential RAF officers to experience life in service and to allow them to decide whether they are suited to it. There is no obligation to join up, unless a bursary is successfully applied for. NUAS is parented by RAF Leeming where it flies Grob Tutor aircraft. NUAS Town Headquarters (THQ) are in Newcastle upon Tyne. Training nights are held on Tuesday evenings at NUAS THQ, and are compulsory for Officer Cadets. Christmas (Freshers' Camp), Easter and Summer Training periods, each a week long, are held at RAF Leeming to further the development of members through flying, adventurous training, sport and force development.  History  NUAS began life in 1941 as Durham University Air Squadron, operating Tiger Moths from RAF Woolsington (now Newcastle International Airport). It moved to RAF Ouston in 1974 and re- equipped with Chipmunk T10s. The name was changed to Northumbrian Universities Air Squadron in 1963 when Newcastle University was established, and following a move to RAF Leeming in 1974 it converted to the Bulldog TMK1. Affiliated Units NUAS parents 11 Air Experience Flight with which it shares aircraft to allow local cadet units the chance to experience flying. Flying University Air Squadron Scottish Aviation Bulldog at RAF Cottesmore in 2000 Students follow a modified form of the Elementary Flying Syllabus covering the basics of flight up to solo navigation exercises. Students that complete this initial syllabus can then progress to the Advanced Flying Syllabus and learn formation flying, aerobatics, and low-level navigation skills. Each student is officially allocated 10 hours of flying training each year, though occasionally some flyers exceed this amount. Some individuals apply for a PPL from their flying experience on the UAS. The flying aspect of NUAS is overseen by the Commanding Officer (OC NUAS) and the Chief Flying Instructor (CFI), both of which are RAF Qualified Flying Instructors (QFIs). Additional Instructors are sometimes available on flying Training Periods. All flying is based at RAF Leeming where the Grob Tutor is used as the instructional aircraft. Previous types operated were the de Havilland Chipmunk and Scottish Aviation Bulldog. Adventurous Training NUAS participates in many forms of adventurous training (AT), including climbing, canoeing, kayaking, mountaineering, sailing, ski touring and mountain biking. The squadron's Ground Training Instructor (GTI) facilitates many of the above activities, but most activities and exercises are organised by students - either individually, or in small groups. NUAS relies heavily on student instructors for adventurous training (AT). Qualifications can be gained by attending a Joint Services Adventure Training (JSAT) course,JSAT Courses which is usually free. Students attending will be taught the necessary techniques for successful and safe instruction in their chosen discipline, and can then lead others on AT. Sports NUAS takes part in many inter-UAS and inter-service competitions, and occasionally provides an RAF presence at major sporting fixtures. Joining Students can join NUAS in any year at university, provided they have two complete years remaining on their course, and usually stay for two years, provided their attitude and commitment are good. Students from the Universities of Durham, Newcastle, Northumbria, Sunderland and Teesside may apply to join, but due to time and personnel constraints, NUAS only attends some of these universities' Freshers' Fairs. Students who are deemed an asset may be invited to continue their careers with NUAS and stay for a further year, subject to them remaining in university and remaining committed to joining the RAF. After completing the joining process a successful student would be attested and become a member of the Volunteer Reserve. =Fitness= Once attested, students have to pass a medical and a fitness test (The Royal Air Force Fitness Test). While general good fitness will improve anyone's quality of life, NUAS requires a minimum standard. Males should aim for at least a 9.10 on the bleep test, 20 press ups and 36 sit ups. While these are the minimum standards for joining, individuals who are fitter tend to benefit more from UAS membership. =Bursaries= Bursaries are available for most branches and can be applied for before joining (conferring automatic UAS membership) or after joining a UAS. The current system gives a successful candidate ¬£6,000 over the course of their degree. The application process consists of an informal chat with UAS staff or an interview at a career office, for UAS members and non-members respectively. If successful an invitation for selection at the OASC may follow. Successful applicants will be expected to be an example on their squadron and must join the RAF on completion of their degrees, or return all bursary monies. Structure The Commanding Officer (OC NUAS) has overall responsibility, supported by the Adjutant who oversees administrative tasks and is supported by office staff at the squadron's town headquarters. The student body has a Senior Student, usually an Acting Pilot Officer (APO) who essentially heads the student body, and aside from the extra commitment organising activities, he or she acts as a liaison to the permanent staff. The Senior Student is supported by a Deputy Senior Student and two Flight Commanders, again APOs, who oversee the two student flights and participate in the running of the squadron. They are assisted by an executive committee which is chosen from the student body each year.

He was executed as a rebel. He married Lady Catherine Howard (b. abt 1499 Ashwellthorpe, Norfolk, England), the daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk and his second wife Agnes Tilney. Early life Rhys was the grandson of Rhys ap Thomas, the most powerful man in Wales and close ally of Henry VII. His father, Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas, died in 1521, leaving him his grandfather's heir. In 1524 Rhys married Catherine Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk.Dictionary of Welsh Biography, National Library of Wales As his grandfather's heir, Rhys expected to inherit his estates and titles. When Rhys ap Thomas died in 1525, Henry VIII gave his most important titles and powers to Walter Devereux, Lord Ferrers, leading to a feud between Rhys and Ferrers which escalated over the next few years. Conflict with Ferrers Rhys attempted to increase his status in Wales, petitioning Cardinal Thomas Wolsey to be given various posts. Potential for conflict with Ferrers increased when both men were given the right to extend their number of retainers; this led to the emergence of competing armed gangs. The bad-blood between Rhys and Ferrers reached a crisis-point in June 1529 when Ferrers made a display of his status during preparations for the annual Court of Great Sessions in Carmarthen. Rhys, surrounded by forty armed men, threatened Ferrers with a knife. Rhys was arrested and imprisoned in Carmarthen Castle. Rhys's wife Catherine escalated the situation by collecting hundreds of her supporters and attacking the castle. She later threatened Ferrers himself with an armed gang. In the conflict between the two factions several of Ferrers's men were killed. The factions continued to cause other disruptions over the coming months, leading to deaths in street-fights and acts of piracy. Treason charges The rebellious actions of Rhys's supporters led to Rhys's transfer to prison in London by 1531. By this stage Henry was claiming that Rhys was attempting to overthrow his government in Wales. Rhys had added the title Fitz-Urien to his name, referring to Urien, the ancient Welsh ruler of Rheged, a person of mythical significance. Rhys's accusers claimed that this was an attempt to assert himself as Prince of Wales. He was supposed to be plotting with James V of Scotland to overthrow Henry in fulfilment of ancient Welsh prophesies. Rhys was convicted of treason and was executed in December 1531. The execution caused widespread dismay and he was openly said to have been innocent. Contemporary writer Ellis Gruffudd, however, argued that the arrogance of the Rhys family had caused their downfall, saying that \\"many men regarded his death as Divine retribution for the falsehoods of his ancestors, his grandfather, and great-grandfather, and for their oppressions and wrongs. They had many a deep curse from the poor people who were their neighbours, for depriving them of their homes, lands and riches.\\"Griffiths, p.72. Historian Ralph Griffith asserts that \\"Rhys's execution...was an act of judicial murder based on charges devised to suit the prevailing political and dynastic situation\\". Since it was linked to Henry's attempt to centralise power and break with the church of Rome, he argues that it \\"in retrospect made him [Rhys] one of the earliest martyrs of the English Reformation.\\"Ralph Griffith, Rhys ap Thomas and his Family, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 1993, pp.106, 110‚Äì11. Rhys was believed to be opposed to the Reformation and had spoken disparagingly of Anne Boleyn. He had also been friendly with Katherine of Aragon and Cardinal Wolsey, so ridding himself of Rhys helped Henry to prepare the ground for the Reformation.London Carmarthenshire society, A history of Carmarthenshire, Volume 1, Society by W. Lewis limited, 1935, p.263. The execution led to fears of a Welsh rebellion. One clergyman was concerned that the Welsh and Irish would join together. Family With his death Rhys' vast possessions were forfeit to the crown. His children are known by the Anglicised surname \\"Rice\\". His son, Griffith Rice (c.1530‚Äì1584), was restored to some of the family estates by Queen Mary. His daughter Agnes Rice had a celebrated affair with William Stourton, 7th Baron Stourton, and in defiance of the rights of his widow and children, she inherited much of the Stourton estates after his death in 1548. She later married Sir Edward Baynton, and had children by both William and Edward.

Type families are a feature of some type systems that allow partial functions between types to be defined by pattern matching. This is in contrast to data type constructors, which define injective functions from all types of a particular kind to a new set of types, and type synonyms (a.k.a. typedef), which define functions from all types of a particular kind to another existing set of types using a single case. Type families and type classes are closely related: normal type classes define partial functions from types to a collection of named values by pattern matching on the input types, while type families define partial functions from types to types by pattern matching on the input types. In fact, in many uses of type families there is a single type class which logically contains both values and types associated with each instance. A type family declared inside a type class is called an associated type. Programming languages with support for type families or similar features include Haskell (with a common language extension), Standard ML (through its module system), Scala (under the name \\"abstract types\\"), and C++ (through use of typedefs in templates).  Variations  The \`TypeFamilies\` extension in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler supports both type synonym families and data families. Type synonym families are the more flexible (but harder to type- check) form, permitting the types in the codomain of the type function to be any type whatsoever with the appropriate kind. Data families, on the other hand, restrict the codomain by requiring each instance to define a new type constructor for the function's result. This ensures that the function is injective, allowing clients' contexts to deconstruct the type family and obtain the original argument type.  Motivation and examples  Type families are useful in abstracting patterns where a common \\"organization\\" or \\"structure\\" of types is repeated, but with different specific types in each case. Typical use cases include describing abstract data types like generic collections, or design patterns like model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller. = Self- optimizing abstract data types = One of the original motivations for the introduction of associated types was to allow abstract data types to be parameterized by their content type such that the data structure implementing the abstract type varies in a \\"self-optimizing\\" way. Normal algebraic data type parameters can only describe data structures that behave uniformly with respect to all argument types. Associated types, however, can describe a family of data structures that have a uniform interface but vary in implementation according to one or more type parameters. For example, using Haskell's associated types notation, we can declare a type class of valid array element types, with an associated data family representing an array of that element type: class ArrayElem e where data Array e index :: Array e -> Int -> e Instances can then be defined for this class, which define both the data structure used and the operations on the data structure in a single location. For efficiency, we might use a packed bit vector representation for arrays of Boolean values, while using a normal array data structure for integer values. The data structure for arrays of ordered pairs is defined recursively as a pair of arrays of each of the element types. instance ArrayElem Bool where data Array Bool = BoolArray BitVector index (BoolArray ar) i = indexBitVector ar i instance ArrayElem Int where data Array Int = IntArray UIntArr index (IntArray ar) i = indexUIntArr ar i instance (ArrayElem a, ArrayElem b) => ArrayElem (a, b) where data Array (a, b) = PairArray (Array a) (Array b) index (PairArray ar br) = (index ar i, index br i) With these definitions, when a client refers to an \`Array (Int, Bool)\`, an implementation is automatically selected using the defined instances. = A class for collections = Inverting the previous example, we can also use type families to define a class for collection types, where the type function maps each collection type to its corresponding element type: class Collects c where type Elem c empty :: c insert :: Elem c -> c -> c toList :: c -> [Elem c] instance Collects [e] where type Elem [e] = e empty = [] insert = (:) toList = id instance Ord e => Collects (Set.Set e) where type Elem (Set.Set e) = e empty = Set.empty insert = Set.insert toList = Set.toList In this example, the use of a type synonym family instead of a data family is essential, since multiple collection types may have the same element type.  Comparison with functional dependencies  Functional dependencies are another type system feature that have similar uses to associated types. While an associated type adds a named type function mapping the enclosing type class's parameters to another type, a functional dependency lists the result type as another parameter of the type class and adds a constraint between the type parameters (e.g. \\"parameter a uniquely determines parameter b\\", written \`a -> b\`). The most common uses of functional dependencies can be directly converted to associated types and vice versa. Type families are regarded as being generally easier to type-check than functional dependencies. Another advantage of associated types over functional dependencies is that the latter requires clients using the type class to state all of the dependent types in their contexts, including ones they do not use; since associated types do not require this, adding another associated type to the class requires updating only the class's instances, while clients can remain unchanged. The main advantages of functional dependencies over type families are in their added flexibility in handling a few unusual cases.

The total area of the island is about and the castle covers most of this area. Kƒ±zkalesi, the town facing the island in the main land which shares the same name as the island is to Erdemli (district center) and to Mersin (province center). History According to Strabo, the island was used by the pirates in the ancient age. But the castle was probably built by Alexios I Komnenos of the Byzantine Empire after the First Crusade.Castles page It was extensively rebuilt in the 13th century by Leo I and at least one subsequent monarch of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.Mersin Valiliƒüi: Mersin √ñren Yerleri, . Archaeological surveys published in 1982 and 1987 found that the original Byzantine plan survives primarily at the south with the characteristic square towers. The Armenians rebuilt the north and west sides of the castle with their distinctive rusticated ashlar masonry (not spolia from the late antique city) and round towers. They also put new facing stone on most of the Greek construction. Two Armenian inscriptions reportedly mention the rebuilding of this site by King Leo I (1206) and King Het‚Äõum I (1251). The Armenians also built a barrel vaulted chapel inside the fort.Edwards, Robert W., ‚ÄúEcclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: First Report, Dumbarton Oaks Papers 36, 1982, pp.173-75, pls.38-42. The island was once connected to the mainland fort, Corycus castle, by a breakwater. The Armenians called this fortress Gorygos (‘ø’∏’º’´’Ø’∏’Ω).In the 14th century the Cilician Kingdom was on the verge of collapse and in 1360 Peter I of Cyprus captured the island at the request of the inhabitants. The castle was captured by ƒ∞brahim II of Karaman of the Karamanids, an Anatolian beylik, in 1448,Kƒ±zkalesi mayor's page and by Gedik Ahmet Pasha of the Ottoman Empire in 1471. The name Goygos was changed to Kƒ±zkalesi. Description The total length of the rampart is . The south and the west walls are perpendicular to each other. The north and east sides are surrounded by a curved rampart. The main gate is on the north side and there is a minor gate and a gallery on the west side. There are 8 bastions each with a unique shape. An extensive photographic survey with plans of the two fortress at Kƒ±zkalesi was made between 1973 and 1981.The survey was conducted under the auspices of the University of California at Berkeley. Legend of Kƒ±zkalesi According to the legend of Kƒ±zkalesi, a fortune teller informs the king that his beautiful daughter will be poisoned by a snake. He adds that even the king is unable to change her fate. Shocked by the fortune teller's words, the king tries to save the princess by building a castle on an island where no snakes live. He sends his daughter to live in the castle. But a snake hides in a grape basket sent from the mainland and poisons the princess.

It was established in April, 1963 as the Advanced Teachers Training College by the defunct Eastern Nigeria Government on the grounds of the Old Shell Camp, Owerri. It has since expanded across the Orlu Road on the Nworie River. It awards the National Certificate in Education (NCE) and the Professional Diploma in Education (PDE) and, in affiliation, with the University of Nigeria, Nsukka the Bachelor of Education (B.ed) since 1984. The Provost is Dr. Dan C. Anyanwu. He took over, in 2017, from Professor Blessing C. Ijioma, who was the first female Provost of the College. History The College was founded in 1963 as the Advanced Teachers Training College with technical assistance from UNESCO. It was charged with the responsibility of training teachers in line with the Ashby report on Higher Education in Nigeria. In 1973, via Edict No. 11 promulgated by the Administrator of East-Central State of Nigeria, Ukpabi Asika, the Teachers College became a College of Education and was named Alvan Ikoku in honour of Mr. Alvan Ikoku, a teacher and educationist, founder of the first African owned secondary school in Nigeria (Aggrey Memorial Grammar School) and President of the Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) for many years.Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education (2012). Sandwich/EWP Students Handbook. Art Publishers: Owerri. The College started with 150 students but by 2012 the student population had grown to over 13,000, with over 600 academic staff. The students include regular undergraduates, sandwich course students, evening and weekend students and post-graduates studying the Professional Diploma in Education. In 1976, a campus of the College catering to the Department of Agriculture was established in Umuahia, now the capital of Abia State. Next was the establishment of an Orlu campus in 1981, but the multi-campus system was ended in 1987 and the college reverted to a single campus institution. In 2007, the Federal Government took over the college and it metamorphosed into Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education, Owerri. The Federal Government take- over brought improved financial aid and the College has become able to renovate dilapidated structures, build large classrooms, laboratories and hostels and expanded the staff strength. On May 20, 2015, the Federal Government of Nigeria under President Goodluck Jonathan upgraded the school to a full-fledged university to be called Alvan Ikoku University of Education. However, a few months later, the Muhammadu Buhari administration put the upgrade \\"on hold.\\" =Schools= The College has seven schools which include the: # School of Vocational and Technical Education # School of Languages # School of General Education # School of Sciences # School of Arts and Social Sciences # School of General Studies #School of Early Childhood and Primary Education Principals/Provosts * Mr. A.

Anyanwu (2017 - ) Academics The establishment of the Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education, Owerri in 1963, just three years after Nigeria‚Äôs independence was a milestone in the annals of education in Nigeria, especially the South-East. As an institution solely disposed to research, teaching and training teachers for both the intermediate and higher education sectors, the College has in the past fifty years contributed to the production of quality teachers in the country. In 1984, the College became affiliated with the University of Nigeria, Nsukka to award the bachelor's degree in various subject areas. The College houses the students in hostels named alphabetically from A-G. The College has students from all over the country and several countries from West Africa, especially the Spanish speaking countries whose citizens come to study English at the International Centre for English Studies (ICES). The College has a predominantly female student population with females making up over 80%. Consequently, the female volleyball team is one of the strongest in the Collegiate games in the country, consistently winning gold or silver in the Nigerian College of Education Games (NICEGA). The Sandwich Programme caters for people pursuing a teaching career who want to improve their education. These students study during the holidays when the regular undergraduate students have dispersed and primary and secondary schools are on break. The Sandwich system has enabled many teachers to get the relevant credentials to progress in the teaching profession. The students have a Student Union Government (SUG) led by an elected President and a Students Representative Council (SRC), a body of elected student legislators. In spite of the dominant female population, the SUG Presidents have always been males. The College runs demonstration centres. They are Department of Early Childhood Care Kindergarten/Nursery School, Department of Primary Education School and the School of Education Demonstration Secondary School. The Primary School was set up in 1983 and the Secondary School started in October, 1994. The demonstration centres were established to help teachers and students carry out their teaching practice activities, a major requirement for graduation, and to solve the educational needs of the staff and general public by providing professionally run schools at the three levels.

Yansaneh accused the men of working for his landlord, Fatamata Hassan Komeh (who was a Member of Parliament for the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party), who had been trying to evict the paper from their building because of reports critical of the government. Although Komeh and two other men were arrested after Yansaneh's death, no charges were eventually brought. Newspaper editor Harry Yansaneh was a recent graduate of the journalism school from the University of Sierra Leone, when he became the acting editor of the newspaper For Di People. The managing editor of the newspaper, Paul Kamara, was sentenced to prison for seditious libel in October 2004. Attack and death For Di People and five other newspapers (The African Champion, The Independent Observer, The Pioneer, The Pool, and The Progress) had rented the building at 1 Short Street in Freetown for over a decade when the landlord died and his wife, Fatamata Hassan Komeh, inherited the building Within a few months, Hassan Komeh (who was a new MP for the SLPP) began efforts to try and evict the newspapers, reportedly for publishing reports critical of the government. The efforts came to a head on 10 May 2005 when two sons of Hassan Komeh and three other men were claimed to have entered the offices of For Di People and damaged computers and other property and assaulted Yansaneh. The same day Hassan Komeh shut off the backup power for the building which prevented all of the papers from publishing issues for a number of days. The attack left Yansaneh unconscious but he was not hospitalized. After regaining consciousness, he accused Komeh of being behind the attack and immediately filed a police report. After a week, the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists (SLAJ) filed a complaint with the Ombudsman of Sierra Leone who filed the complaint directly with the Parliament. As a result of injuries to his kidneys as a result of the attack, Yansaneh died on 28 July 2005 at a hospital in Freetown, the capital of the country. Following his death, a second complaint from SLAJ resulted in a judicial inquest into the matter which found that Yansaneh died as a result of involuntary manslaughter. As a result of this finding, arrests were made on Hassan Komeh and two men, Olu Campbell and Reginald Bull, on 26 August 2005. Extradition requests were filed for her children Ahmed Komeh, Bai Bureh Komeh, Aminata Komeh who had traveled to the United Kingdom after the incident.

On 26 August 1803, the first session was held.

This is a relatively new idiomatic expression, which has come to acquire a variety of other meanings in the process of becoming more widespread.  History = Origin = A hypothesis for the origin of the phrase was offered in an article in the journal \\"Russian speech\\" by A. V. Zelenin, who believed that it originated from films about Zorro, the hallmark of which were the letter Z, and had spread in the 1970s and 80s among college students. According to Zelenin, the letter zyu was created by replacing the last two letters of the British English name for the Latin letter Z with the letter \\"Yu (Cyrillic)\\". Zelenin believed that this change occurred under the influence of the Greek letters Mu and Nu, the phonetic form of which, in his view, bemused students. The phonetic combination of \\"zyu\\" is rather unusual in the Russian language. L. V. Uspensky in his 1973 book \\"Under the law the letter\\" cited the words zyuzya and nazyuzitsya as an example of the syllable \\"zyu.\\" = Later usage = Zelenin wrote that, initially, in 1980s, the phrase \\"the letter zyu\\" denoted the strangely bent position of the human body that was widespread among car owners in the Soviet Union who spent a lot of time repairing their cars. Later, toward the end of the 1980s, the phraseme entered into the lexicon of dacha owners and came to mean long-term work in a kneeling position on the ground. This usage, without reference to the dacha or automobiles, became widespread not only in the spoken language, but also in the press and in literary language. In the process of evolving into an idiomatic expression, the phrase became distanced from its original meaning, \\"resembling the letter Z,\\" and came to mean curvature of any kind. The expression is now used to refer to any object that is found in a curved, strange state. In the mid-1990s, the expression penetrated into journalism, undergoing bizarre semantic transformations. According to Zelenin, \\"the letter zyu\\" contained significant potential and in the near future would be widespread in phraseological textbooks and dictionaries. However, the expression \\"the letter zyu\\" can be found only in the lexicon of speakers living in large metropolitan areas in Russia and, to a lesser extent, in some countries of the former Soviet Union. Thus, the idiom (zignuty) yak letter zyu attracted the attention of the Kharkov philologist N. F. Umantseva. In Russian-speaking communities of foreign countries outside the former Soviet Union, the expression is not popular. According to A. V. Zelenin, this is due to the fact that Russian people surrounded by the Latin alphabet are less likely to discover the possibility of a different, ironic take on the letter Z.  Other meanings  Zu letter (Letter Zu), intended for the transliteration of English letters and their combinations in Russian letters The large variety of meanings taken on by the expression was due to a shift in semantic emphasis from the second word, \\"zyu,\\" to the first word, \\"letter.\\" Zelenin characterized this as the \\"actualization of the first, nominative, element of the combination.\\" By a transfer of meaning, \\"the letter zyu\\" began to denote illegible handwriting, a mysterious character, or just scribbles. In the Great dictionary of Russian proverbs of Mokienko and Nikitina, there is an alternative meaning of the expression: there, the letter zyu is described as school jargon, a playful nickname for a math teacher. A related, new slang phrase is also found there: the \\"clumsy zyu,\\" which denotes a strangely dressed man. There is a popular computer program Zu letter (Letter Zu), intended for the transliteration of English letters and their combinations in Russian letters. = Zyuganov and letter zyu = the 34th letter of the Russian alphabet ‚Äì letter Zyu The first syllable of the surname of G.A. Zyuganov is actively used as a source for his nicknames. In 1999, Dmitry Bykov published an article on the political career of G.A. Zyuganov, entitled \\"The letter zyu\\". In this article, he writes about Zyuganov as a loser politician, in particular noting that his name associates with the \\"zyu\\", a radiculitis pose\\". On Zyuganov's 65th birthday, trade unionists presented him with, among other things, a depiction of \\"the 34th letter of the Russian alphabet ‚Äì the letter Zyu\\" (see illustration).

It is primarily used for ice sports and is the home arena of Hungarian top division ice hockey club Miskolci JJSE. Construction The Municipality of Miskolc decided in the summer of 2004 to build an ice rink in the People's Garden, next to the municipal sports arena. The initial plans were to cover the ice rink with awning at an estimated cost of 310 million Hungarian Forint (approximately US$1.5 million), thus the ice season could be extended. In 2005, however, the representative body of the local government voted for the construction of a multifunctional hall. The project cost was calculated for about 480 million Hungarian Forint (US$2.3 million), which eventually rose to 1.1 billion Hungarian Forint (US$5.3 million). The building and its unique wooden roof was designed by L√°szl√≥ Rost√°s and his architect group, Arc √âp√≠t√©sz Kft. =Technical details= The arena has 1,800 m¬≤ ice surface which makes it suitable to host qualified international events. The ice surface can be covered with a moveable floor thus the multifunctional sports hall can arrange other sports and public events. The grandstand is divided to 10 sectors and has 1,304 seats and an additional 30-seats VIP box. The hall has a complete backroung service (dressing rooms, technical rooms, etc.) and is equipped with modern technical equipment.

The \\"Jewish\\" nature was first defined within the Declaration of Independence of 1948 (see Jewish state and Jewish homeland). The \\"Democratic\\" character was first officially added in the amendment to the Basic Law: the Knesset that was passed in 1985 (amendment 9, clause 7A). Numerous scholars and political observers have debated the definition, particularly whether the terms are contradictory or complementary. According to Yossi Klein Halevi, \\"Israel is based on two non-negotiable identities. The homeland of all Jews, whether or not they are citizens of Israel, and it's the state of all its citizens, whether or not they are Jews.\\" Background=Jewish State= Israeli Declaration of Independence The Israeli Declaration of Independence identifies Israel as a \\"Jewish State,\\"THE DECLARATION OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL May 14, 1948 Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, official text in the sense that Jews as an ethnicity can exercise their right for self determination. It doesn't give a Judaism any special status over other religions nor does it deny minority rights. =Democratic state= The word \\"Democratic\\" is absent throughout the Israeli Declaration of Independence. However, the declaration states the intention to: and appeals to: =Basic Law of 1985= Since no constitution had been passed by 1985, the Supreme Court ruled that the Declaration of Independence document is a guiding principle of Israeli society and its state, the need to legally define the Jewish nature and Democratic character of the State of Israel arose. During the 1984 Knesset elections, religious ideas were brought up that were aimed at canceling the democratic character of Israel, and replacing it with a theocratic Halachic state, and thus in the eleventh Knesset session, the amendment to the Basic Law: the Knesset was passed (to become effective as of the Twelfth Knesset), that stipulated that: =Later usage= Since then the definition of \\"a Jewish and democratic state\\" was used in additional Basic Laws of Israel: Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation, that were legislated in 1992, and amended in 1994. These laws specifically states that: Public debate As part of a project to draft a constitution for Israel by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) led by former Chief Justice Aharon Barak, the country's Jewish and democratic character was described as follows: > The State of Israel is a Jewish state in the following two senses: it is the > political framework in which the right of the Jewish people to self- > determination is manifested and it is a \\"Jewish nation-state.\\" A first and > necessary condition to being a Jewish and democratic state is a decisive > majority of Jews in the State. Israel's attribute as a Jewish and democratic > state is conveyed through aspects of Zionism and Jewish heritage; first and > foremost, each and every Jew has the right to immigrate to the State of > Israel. Other aspects are Hebrew being the main official language of the > State and the inextricable link to Jewish culture in public life. On the > other hand, the characterization of the State as Jewish is not intended to > bestow extra privileges on its Jewish citizens and does not obligate the > imposition of religious requirements by state law. > The State of Israel is democratic in the following sense: the sovereign is > the entire community of the nation's citizens (and it alone), irrespective > of ethnic-national origin. In the main, the character of the State as a > democratic country is manifested by two basic principles: the first being > the recognition of the dignity of man qua man, and the second, derived from > the first, is the recognition of the values of equality and tolerance. > Arrangements regarding free and equal elections, the recognition of the core > human rights, including dignity and equality, separation of powers, the rule > of law, and an independent judiciary, are all drawn from these principles. > Democracy's basic principles require equal treatment of all those included > as citizens of the State, without regard to their ethnic, religious, > cultural, and linguistic affiliations.Constitution by Consensus, proposed by > the Israel Democracy Institute. The IDI concludes that \\"the definition of Israel as a 'Jewish state' does not contradict its definition as a 'state of its citizens.' Although the State is Jewish in that, within its framework, the realization of certain interests of the Jewish people is ensured and its identity is protected and developed, nonetheless, its sovereignty lies in its community of citizens, including the non-Jewish community.\\" The boundaries of the definition of \\"a Jewish and democratic state\\" are subject to public discourse in Israel, in context of the relation between state and government. Already in 1994, the question whether Israeli Government (i.e. the Cabinet) is permitted to limit the import of Non- Kosher meat, despite the Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation arose. Initially, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the government is not permitted to limit such import of non-Kosher meat. However, after the Knesset passed some amendments to the basic laws, the limit was included. Another debate was on the issue of whether the state is permitted to limit the leasing of national land in certain areas of Israel exclusively to Jews. The Diversity of Israeli Society has produced a few main approaches to the definition of \\"a Jewish and Democratic State\\", which the current commonly accepted approach is the combination of all of them: \\"A Torah State\\" (Halachic state), \\"National- Religious State\\", \\"National Culture State\\", \\"The State of the Jewish People\\", \\"The Jewish State\\", and \\"The Jewish State and the State of all its citizens\\". According to a 2013 Israel Democracy Institute poll, three-quarters of Israeli Jews \\"believe that the State of Israel can be both Jewish and democratic\\", whereas two-thirds of Israeli Arabs do not believe that such a combination is possible.2013 Democracy Index, \\"A sizeable majority of Jews (74.8%) believe that the State of Israel can be both Jewish and democratic. Only a third of Arab respondents share this view\\"  Israeli High Court of Justice's commentary  The Fifteenth Knesset again amended the \\"Basic Law: The Knesset\\", in order to enforce the limit not only upon a party of candidates list but also upon each individual, separately: During the Elections for the 16th Knesset, the Israeli Central Elections Committee disqualified the candidacy of Azmi Bishara and of Ahmad Tibi based upon this law. The petition to disqualify right-wing activist Baruch Marzel was rejected. As a result of this rejection, petitions were submitted to the High Court of Justice against all three rulings of the Central Elections Committee. Therefore, the clause within the Basic Law: The Knesset, was now a subject to a thorough judicial examination by the High Court of Justice, and eventually the High Court of Justice had turned around the former two ruling by Central Elections Committee, and approved the latter, hence, all three candidates were permitted to participate in the elections. Regarding the meaning of the definition of \\"Jewish and democratic state\\" in this section of the law, then President of the Supreme Court of Israel, Aharon Barak, wrote that a narrow interpretation should be given to it, since it limits a basic right, in contrast to the broader interpretation that should be given to laws concerning Human rights. Concerning the minimal interpretation of \\"a Jewish State\\", Justice Aharon Barak ruled that: According to Chief Justice Barak the minimal definition of \\"a Democratic State\\" is: Therefore: Chief Justice Barak pondered whether every candidates list objecting the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state should be disqualified, or a \\"Probabilistic standard\\" should be adopted, wherein according to this standard, a candidates list may be disqualified only if there is a real chance that it will actually succeed in promoting its goals that are in contradictory to the nature of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state. Eventually, he left that question open for future judicial debate, stating that \\"it requires more review\\".

The Tabula Peutingeriana situates it in between the castella of Matilo and Nigrum Pullum.Tabula Peutingeriana, second segment (Pars II) It was part of the Lower Germanic Limes and separated the Roman Empire from tribal country to the north. History The origin of Alphen aan den Rijn can be dated back to approximately 2,000 years ago. The town that now consists of over 70,000 inhabitants was once only a fraction of that. It was a Roman colony, named a castellum. The name Castellum Albaniana means ‚Äòcolony by the white waters‚Äô. These white waters likely refer to the Old Rhine, where the army camp was situated. =Castellum= Fragment of the entrance gate, built during the reign of Septimius Severus A dendrochronological dating of the wood enables us to say that the fort was built after the state visit of Caligula to Germania Inferior in AD 40-41.Lendering, J. (2009) Albaniana (Alphen aan den Rijn). Accessed: 28-02-2017 The wooden building was meant to protect the ‚Äòlimes‚Äô; the Roman border consisting of the Rijn. Caligula built this fort with the idea of crossing over to Great Britain; this was not accomplished during his reign, although his successor Claudius succeeded. The building was an isolated outpost, few colonies were located nearby. The complex was exclusively made of wood. It had wooden outer walls and wooden watchtowers. Outside the walls canals were dug. This wall was approximately a hundred and twenty meters long and eighty meters wide. During the Revolt of the Batavi (between AD 69 and 70) the wall was demolished by the Cananefates; this was later rebuilt after the rebellion had been quelled. Around 160 AD, the wooden wall had been replaced by a brick wall. It was around this time that a new entrance gate was built, carrying an inscription referring to Emperor Septimius Severus. The reason for this was that Emperor Severus himself had given the order to repair the damages inflicted on the wall. During its glory days, the army camp consisted of approximately four hundred soldiers. All of which brought their families with them. =Vicus= Similar to the other Limes-forts, the Albaniana included a camp village known as a vicus. East of the fort merchants, craftsmen and prostitutes from inside and outside the Roman Empire offer their goods and services. For the soldiers and their families this was prime ground for shopping and entertainment. Needless to say the vicus formed a meeting ground of cultures, where it was inevitable that the Germans and Romans mutually influenced each other. =After the second century= In the middle of the third century, presumably 270 AD, the castellum and vicus were vacated. German tribes crossed the Rhine and invaded the Roman Empire. Soldiers from the different forts could no longer withstand the enemy. German tribes plundered the castella. In medieval times the forts were used as quarries, after which the remains disappeared underground. These remnants were only rediscovered in the twentieth century. By then most of the area had been built upon, causing much to remain lost. Archeology In 2001 extensive archaeological research started in the centre of Alphen aan den Rijn. Many findings were done here. Remnants of the castellum, the canabae located close by and cemeteries were discovered. Pieces of two elongated buildings that may have served as storage were found. Within the castellum barracks were found, with wooden floors. Furthermore, military and personal objects belonging to the soldiers were identified, such as writing utensils, a mirror, and over eight hundred coins dating from the reign of Roman Emperors Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero (between 14-68 AD). In addition, leftover food had been preserved, making it possible to research the farming techniques and eating habits of the soldiers. Foundations were exhumed, providing us with knowledge on building techniques used by the ancients Romans. In Albaniana stamps of the ‚ÄòClassis Germanica‚Äô, a Roman military fleet, were found. A number of these discovered artifacts can currently be found in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden. Present-day features The village of Alphen aan den Rijn has not completely forgotten its history. A great theatre and cinema, named ‚Äòcastellum‚Äô as well, can be found where the camp used to be located. A stone engraved with Roman inscriptions lies near the water on the Rijnplein in Alphen aan den Rijn. Furthermore, a historical park named Archeon can be found in Alphen aan den Rijn. There the early history of the village can be admired, as this has been recreated and re- enacted.

It describes itself as \\"a feminist organization against the occupation of Palestine and for a just peace.\\". CWP says that it is \\"committed to ending the occupation and creating a more just society, while enhancing women‚Äôs inclusion and participation in the public discourse\\". The groups that founded the Coalition of Women for Peace are Machsom Watch, Noga Feminist Journal, Women in Black, The Fifth Mother, TANDI, Bat Shalom, New Profile and NELED.CWP History The Coalition of Women for Peace came to an agreement on their principles for a solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at a conference in Nazareth in November 2000. # the struggle to end the occupation on the basis of two states for two peoples # Jerusalem as two capitals for two states # a just solution to the refugee problem based on UN resolutions # involvement of women in peace negotiations # reducing Israel‚Äôs militarism # social and economic justice for all # equal citizenship of the Palestinian citizens and integration of Israel into the Middle East In 2009 the Coalition of Women for Peace held a series of ideological and political debates to revise these principles to reflect the current positions of its activists. This includes a political solution based on historical justice and international law (recognizing the two state solution as only one possible outcome) and support for the Right of Return of Palestinian refugees. View on Palestinian Statehood Bid CWP released a statement in September 2011 saying that a \\"mere declaration of statehood in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is incapable of ending decades of occupation and racial discrimination based on legal mechanisms that match the UN definition of apartheid, to solve the refugee problem or to lead to civil equality between Jews and Palestinians citizens of Israel. These issues can only be resolved in a just agreement to end the occupation while maintaining the basic individual and collective rights of Palestinians, wherever they reside.

The first group was formed by Israeli women in Jerusalem in 1988, following the outbreak of the First Intifada. History Paris Square, Jerusalem, with the distinctive black stop signs calling \\"Stop the occupation\\" in three languages Responding to what they considered serious violations of human rights by Israeli soldiers in the Occupied Territories, the women held a vigil every Friday in central Jerusalem, wearing black clothing in mourning for all victims of the conflict. Initially the group had no name but it was quickly identified with the black clothing, which also helped create distinctive demonstrations which were hard to ignore. The initiative soon spread to various other locations in Israel, with women standing weekly in main squares of cities or at junctions on inter-city highways. As was decided early on, the movement did not adopt any formal program other than opposition to the occupation. Local groups were autonomous in deciding such issues as whether or not to open participation to men as well as women, and there were many shades of political difference from one place to another. At the peak of the Intifada there were thirty vigils in different locations throughout the country. The number dwindled sharply after the Oslo Agreement in 1993, when it seemed that peace with the Palestinians was at hand, and picked up again when violent events proved that hope to have been premature. The first vigils in other countries were started in solidarity with the Israeli group, but then embraced other social and political issues. Especially notable were the Women in Black group in former Yugoslavia, which in the 1990s confronted rampant nationalism, hatred and bloodshed, often meeting with violence from nationalists. Women in Black in India stands against Hindu Fundamentalism and the violence it inflicted upon women. Women in Black in Italy protest against war and organized crimes. In Australia, WIB stands against domestic violence. While each group is free to pursue its own goals and activities, the women maintain regular contact via e-mail and the Internet, and hold annual international conferences. Their most common tactic consists of standing together periodically in various public places, usually in complete silence unless pedestrians ask questions, which at times escalate into full-fledged arguments. The Women in Black's counter-group is called Women for Israel's Tomorrow who typically wear green hats. The 2015 WIB gathering took place in India, Bangalore with the participation of several feminist organizations.  Political position  In Israel, Women in Black belongs to the radical left. The organization supports the BDS movement. Awards In 2001, the movement was awarded the Millennium Peace Prize for Women given by the United Nations Development Fund for Women.

The first Arab woman to be elected to the legislature on an Arab party's list, she served as a member of the Knesset for the Balad party between 2009 and 2019. Biography Haneen Zoabi was born in Nazareth to a Muslim family. Zoabi studied philosophy and psychology at the University of Haifa, earning a Bachelor of Arts, and received a Master of Arts in communications from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She was the first Arab citizen of Israel to graduate in media studies, and established the first media classes in Arab schools. She also worked as a mathematics teacher and worked as a school inspector for the Israeli Ministry of Education. She is a relative of Seif el- Din el-Zoubi, a former mayor of Nazareth and member of the Knesset between 1949 and 1959, and again from 1965 until 1979, and Abd el-Aziz el-Zoubi, a Deputy Health Minister and the first Arab member of an Israeli government. Political career Zoabi joined Balad in 2001. In 2003, she co-founded the NGO I'lam ‚Äì Media Center for Arab Palestinians in Israel (pronounced e'e'lam). Zoabi was its general director until she resigned shortly before the 2009 election to focus on her political career. She ran for Knesset as a Balad candidate in 2006, but was too low on the party's electoral list to win a seat. However, prior to the 2009 elections she was placed third on the Balad list, and entered the Knesset after the party won three seats, becoming the first female Arab MK to represent an Arab party (the two previous female Arab MKs Hussniya Jabara and Nadia Hilou had represented Meretz and Labor). During the build-up to the January 2013 elections, it was announced in December 2012 that the Central Elections Committee (CEC) and a panel of Supreme Court judges would hold discussions on whether to disqualify Zoabi, as well as the Balad and United Arab List parties, from the upcoming elections. The request for her disqualificationwas submitted by MK Ofir Akunis (Likud) and had obtained the necessary number of signatures. It stated that \\"throughout her years in the Knesset, Zoabi has constantly undermined the State of Israel and has openly incited against the government, its institutions and IDF soldiers.\\" The request also claimed that Zoabi negated Israel's existence as a Jewish and democratic state, which made her eligible for disqualification. Zoabi called the sponsors of the request fascists and said that \\"for whoever does not want citizens to have free elections, I am one of many targets ...\\" She added that only \\"dark regimes\\" are proud of disqualifying election candidates. After hearing the case, the Central Elections Committee disqualified Zoabi in a 19‚Äì9 vote. The Supreme Court overturned the disqualification, with the nine-judge panel headed by Supreme Court President Asher Grunis unanimously voting to overturn the ban. Zoabi was subsequently re-elected. Following the elections, Likud MK Danny Danon initiated a bill dubbed the \\"Zoabi Law\\" in February 2019. An amendment to the Basic Law dealing with legislation, it would make it harder for the Supreme Court to overturn a decision by the Central Elections Committee. The bill failed to pass. Zoabi faced a similar situation prior to the March 2015 elections. On 12 February 2015, the CEC voted 27‚Äì6 to disqualify Zoabi from running in the elections. However, on 18 February the Supreme Court overturned the ruling in an 8‚Äì1 decision. She retired from national politics prior to the April 2019 elections, although she was given a symbolic 113th slot on the joint list of Balad and the United Arab List. Political views and opinions Zoabi views herself as a Palestinian. She considers the two-state solution unrealistic and describes as inherently racist the notion that Israel is a Jewish state. Instead she advocates a single state shared by Jews and Palestinian Arabs with full rights and equality for both national groups. She has said, \\"The reality of Israel's actions shows us that it's unrealistic to have a real sovereign state in the West Bank and Gaza with Jerusalem as the capital. The more realistic solution is one state with full national equality for both national groups.\\" Zoabi argues that rejection of the Jewish state concept is the only way to combat Avigdor Lieberman's demand that Israeli citizens take loyalty oaths. Rejecting the 'Jewish state' concept, she says, \\"is the only idea that can remove Lieberman from the circle of political and moral legitimacy... When you agree with the 'Jewish state' idea, you necessarily agree with the idea of loyalty to this state. Rejecting the 'Jewish state' concept will block the road for anyone who demands our loyalty to such a state.\\" In 2009, she met with Code Pink, and Coalition of Women for Peace. But in 2016 in Switzerland Zoabi retracted this somewhat and said: ::My vision is Justice and liberation. I don't want to formulate our position as Palestinians within the question of one state or two states. This is a procedural question for me... Even if we are talking about two states, none of them can be a Jewish state... both must be democratic. We cannot agree with the notion of a Jewish state. It's not a matter of one or two. It's a matter of justice and liberation. I think this is a terminology we must use.... ::Now! End occupation. Now! The right of return!... my party which I represent talks about two different states. One state for all citizens which is non-Zionist state, non-Jewish state, within the borders of '48. And a Palestinian state, with the right of return.... This is the program of my party. She also believes that the West should engage with rather than boycott Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip. She commented, \\"No one can tell the Palestinian people whom to choose as a government. Hamas is not a terrorist organization.... Regardless of whether I disagree [with Hamas], the international community cannot mediate neutrally if it starts to label the organizations of the Palestinians as illegitimate.\\" She has described soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces as \\"murderers.\\" Zoabi in 2009 described Lieberman, Tzipi Livni, and Benjamin Netanyahu as \\"a bunch of fascists pure and simple\\". She added, however, that [Netanyahu] is \\"much more dangerous\\" than Lieberman, because he \\"shares Lieberman's fascist views but takes care to sugarcoat his message for the international media\\". At the 18th Knesset swearing-in ceremony on 24 February 2009, she left the Knesset plenum before the singing of Hatikva, Israel's national anthem. \\"'Hatikva' doesn't represent me\\", she later said. \\"I preferred to leave the room, because I don't appreciate hypocrisy.\\" Zoabi and the Balad party reject any form of national service for Israel's Arab citizens. = Views on Iran = The Jerusalem Post reported in March 2009 that Zoabi said that she was not concerned that Iran might acquire nuclear weapons. Instead she suggested that the Middle East needed a counterweight to Israel's nuclear weaponry. She explained, \\"I am afraid of real risk rather than of potential risk.\\" An Iranian nuclear weapon, she said, is only a potential threat. \\"The real danger is the IDF.... It is more dangerous to the world, more dangerous to everyone, more dangerous to the Palestinians, to Israelis, to have Israel as the only powerful state.... The violence of the Israeli army is an outcome of Israel's convenient feeling that no one will restrict her.\\" Zoabi also claimed that Iran was a positive influence on Palestinian affairs and had played a more beneficial role in region than Jordan or Egypt because it stood more firmly \\"against occupation than a lot of the Arab countries\\". Balad's chairman at the time, Jamal Zahalka, said that Zoabi's comments represented an analysis rather than a party position, and did not constitute supporting a nuclear armed Iran. In an interview in 2010 in The New Statesmen she asked rhetorically \\"if the world doesn't prevent Israel from having nuclear weapons, why does it prevent others?\\". Participation in the Gaza flotilla On 31 May 2010, Zoabi participated in the Gaza flotilla, and was on board the MV Mavi Marmara when violence broke out as Israeli commandos boarded the ship. Zoabi was arrested and briefly held by authorities. At a news conference upon her release, Zoabi called the raid criminal, saying she witnessed two wounded passengers bleed to death after the Israelis refused to provide requested medical aid. She also stated, \\"It was clear from the size of the force that boarded the ship that the purpose was not only to stop this sail, but to cause the largest possible number of fatalities in order to stop such initiatives in the future.\\" In a speech at the Knesset a day after her release, Zoabi called the raid a \\"pirate military operation\\" and asked for an international investigation. She also demanded to know why the Israeli government had not released photos and videos it confiscated from passengers that might shed light on why nine passengers were killed and dozens wounded. During her address she also said, \\"Israel spoke of a provocation, but there was no provocation. Why does the government of Israel oppose an investigation?\\" Zoabi was repeatedly interrupted and shouted down during the speech by other lawmakers, one of whom shouted \\"Go to Gaza, traitor!\\" The chaos reached a peak when MK Anastasia Michaeli charged the podium in an attempt to prevent Zoabi from continuing. Zoabi received death threats after the speech, and two security guards were assigned for her protection. One man who offered a reward on Facebook of free groceries for killing Zoabi was arrested. Zoabi commented three years after the events, \\"I came to the Knesset two days after the Marmara events, stunned by the way a political protest had become a bloodbath. I hoped that the MKs would want to hear firsthand testimony. I was ready to be questioned. But I was so naive. I encountered hate politics.\\" For her participation in the Gaza flotilla, Israel Interior Minister Eli Yishai requested that Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein revoke Zoabi's parliamentary immunity and authorize Yishai to strip Zoabi of Israeli citizenship. Yishai accused Zoabi of engaging in a \\"premeditated act of treason\\", claiming she had assisted activists on board the Mavi Marmara and was \\"undoubtedly aware\\" of their preparations to attack IDF soldiers. Likud MK Yariv Levin also accused Zoabi of betraying the State of Israel, and called for her prosecution. A Knesset committee voted 7‚Äì1 to recommend her parliamentary immunity be revoked, which attracted concern from the international Inter-Parliamentary Union and was ultimately blocked by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin, who ignored the recommendation and declined to submit it to a vote of the full Knesset. He and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hoped that sparing Zoabi would protect Israel from further international condemnation over its Gaza blockade and its military's actions aboard the Mavi Marmara. Rivlin, known for his advocacy of Arab‚ÄìJewish coexistence, said he was stunned by the assault on Zoabi's privileges as well as the near physical attack upon her. He asked, \\"Would they do that to a Jewish member?\\" When the full Knesset met on 13 July 2010, it decided, in a 34‚Äì16 vote, to strip Zoabi of three parliamentary privileges as a penalty for her participation in the flotilla: the right to have a diplomatic passport, entitlement to financial assistance should she require legal help, and the right to visit countries with which Israel does not have diplomatic relations. She was also stripped of the right to participate in Knesset discussions and to vote in parliamentary committees. In 2011, Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein closed the case against Zoabi because of \\"significant evidentiary and legal difficulties.\\" Israeli foreign ministry tweets Partly because of an Israeli embassy's tweets about Zoabi, in August 2012, the Foreign Ministry of Israel updated its social media guidelines for its worldwide diplomats, clarifying that for practical purposes there is no difference between a tweet or on-line social media post and an official briefing, as they will be interpreted as Israel's official position. This move followed several embarrassing incidents where inappropriate tweets or posts were made by Israeli embassies. One major embarrassment occurred when Zoabi made a speaking tour of Ireland. When she criticized Israel in some of her speeches, the Dublin-based Israeli embassy in Ireland responded with three tweets critical of her, in spite of the fact that she is an elected official. 2014 kidnapping comments and Knesset suspension On 15 June 2014, five days after the kidnapping by Palestinians of three Israeli teenagers, Zoabi said, \\"Is it strange that people living under occupation and living impossible lives, in a situation where Israel kidnaps new prisoners every day, is it strange that they kidnap? They are not terrorists. Even if I do not agree with them, they are people who do not see any way to change their reality, and they are compelled to use means like these\\". Many Israeli public figures criticized Zoabi's words. Labor opposition leader Isaac Herzog said they \\"were harmful to peace and the coexistence of Jews and Arabs in Israel as well as to the families who are hopefully awaiting news regarding their missing loved ones.\\" Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said that \\"not only are the kidnappers terrorists, Hanin Zoabi is a terrorist too.\\" Echoing comments by other Israeli politicians, Knesset Interior Committee chairwoman Miri Regev said, \\"Hanin Zoabi is a traitor and should be deported to Gaza.\\" Zoabi reported receiving hundreds of death threats in the first days after her comments. She commented, \\"I was taken by surprise at the public's reaction. I was surprised since the injustice inflicted on the other side is so much greater. There are thousands of abducted Palestinians in Israeli prisons.... It's not that I want Israelis to be abducted and not released. The exact opposite is the case.\\" On 25 July Israeli attorney general Yehuda Weinstein ordered an investigation of Zoabi on charges of incitement and public disgrace. On July 29, Zoabi was suspended from the Knesset plenum for a duration of six months. During that time she was not allowed to address the Knesset or its committees. Zoabi's appeal to Israel's Supreme Court to overturn the suspension was rejected. Meeting with Palestinian attackers families In February 2016, during the 2015‚Äì2016 wave of violence in Israeli-Palestinian conflict Zoabi and two other Arab Israeli MKs met with the families of Palestinian attackers. The purpose of the meeting was to secure the release of the attackers bodies for burial. For the participation in the meeting she and the two other Arab Israeli MKs were suspended from the Knesset for four months by the Knesset's Ethics Committee.

Houston Express was founded in 1978 and is located in Houston, Texas. It employs professional coaches from around the world. Sponsored by Reliant Energy, Express tries to develop players and serve its local community.http://rochester.kidsoutandabout.com/content/houston-express-soccer- club Levels of play Houston Express runs two soccer programs: West U Rec and Houston Express. West U Rec is low level, easy paced soccer. It is available to players ages 4 to 12. The Rec league is in house. This means that West U teams only play other West U teams. West U Rec also develops players for the more competitive Houston Express program. Players are allowed to move up once they reach U8. The next step up from West U Rec is Houston Express. Houston Express is available to players ages 7 to 18. Players from U8 to U10 are part of the Express Development Academy. The Academy offers better training than the Rec league. Also, teams play other clubs. Professional coaches train Express players. Express teams play in various leagues, such as Eastern District Division One Association (EDDOA) Division 1 and Super 2, Houston Youth Soccer Association (HYSA), US Youth Soccer Region III Premier League, and State Classic League (SCL). Style of play Express maintains the same style of play across most teams and ages. Express coaches teach players to keep possession of the ball. Players are encouraged to work together with teammates and show creativity while helping the team. Coaches teach goalkeepers to quickly put the ball back in play. Winning via long balls and favoring a single player is discouraged as it slows the development of other players. The coaches and faculty at Express have created a well rounded and effective style of play. Fields Houston Express‚Äô primary fields are located at the South Campus complex. South Campus is the largest private youth sports complex in Texas, located on Stella Link and Belfort. This gives Express access to quality playing fields. In addition to the South Campus, Express is developing more fields at McGovern Campus at Stella Link and Bellaire. There will be four 8v8 fields and one 11v11 field. The 11v11 field will have lighting, a scoreboard, locker rooms, and seating for 1,000 spectators.

He writes a regular column for The National, Abu Dhabi. Background Cook was born and raised in Buckinghamshire, England, UK. He received a B.A. (Hons) in Philosophy and Politics from Southampton University in 1987, a postgraduate diploma in journalism from Cardiff University in 1989, and an M.A. in Middle Eastern studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies in 2000.Cook, Jonathan. Short biography, Jhcook.net, accessed 30 November 2009. Career=Journalism= Cook was a freelance sub-editor with several national newspapers from 1994 until 1996. He was a staff journalist at The Guardian and The Observer between 1996 and 2001. Since September 2001, Cook has been a freelance writer based in Nazareth, Israel.Catastrophe remembered: Palestine, Israel and the internal refugees, p. viii. Until 2007 he wrote columns for The Guardian,Jonathan Cook, The Guardian, accessed 30 November 2009. a publication he argued in 2011 limits the expression of dissent via its attacks on Gilad Atzmon, Julian Assange, Noam Chomsky and others. In 2011, Cook received the Martha Gellhorn special award for journalism, \\"for his work on the Middle East\\". His freelance articles have been published by a number of other publications such as The New Statesman, International Herald Tribune, Le Monde Diplomatique, Al-Ahram Weekly, Al Jazeera, The National in Abu Dhabi, CounterPunch, The Electronic Intifada, Mondoweiss, and AlterNet. =Books= Cook has written three books. In Blood and Religion (2006), published by Pluto Press, the central thesis is that, \\"Israel is beginning a long, slow process of ethnic cleansing both of Palestinian non-citizens from parts of the occupied territories that it has long coveted for its expanded Jewish state, and of Palestinian citizens from inside its internationally recognized borders.\\" Cook links this strategy to the Israeli perception of two threats: the physical threat of terrorism and the demographic threat of a Palestinian majority potentialised by high Palestinian birth rates and the continued demand for a Palestinian right of return. The Israeli leadership is also said by Cook to view the idea of a \\"state for all its citizens\\" as a threat. Rami George Khouri describes the short book as, \\"important but disturbing.\\" In 2008, Cook published Israel and the Clash of Civilizations: Iraq, Iran and the plan to remake the Middle East, published by Pluto Press. Of the book, Antony Loewenstein wrote that, \\"Cook bravely skewers the mainstream narrative of a Jewish state constantly striving for peace with the Palestinians.\\" According to Lowenstein, Cook argues that Israel \\"pursues policies that lead to civil war and partition,\\" and that this idea of dissolving many of the nations of the Middle East, shared by the neocons and the Bush administration, was developed by Israel's security establishment in the 1980s. Cook discusses an essay authored by Oded Yinon and published by the World Zionist Organisation in 1982 which advocated for Israel's transformation into a regional imperial power via the fragmentation of the Arab world, \\"into a mosaic of ethnic and confessional groupings that could be more easily manipulated\\" (p. 107). A review of the book in The Jordan Times called it, \\"well-researched and very readable.\\" Disappearing Palestine: Israel's Experiments in Human Despair was published in 2008 by Zed Books. The book is in two parts, with the second half consisting of reprints of articles written by Cook as a journalist. The first half of the book, according to a review in Electronic Intifada, explores the thesis that, \\"the goal of Israeli policy is to make Palestine and the Palestinians disappear for good.\\" Helena Cobban in the Boston Review says Cook argues that to encourage voluntary emigration, Israel has made life unbearable for Palestinians, primarily via \\"the ever more sophisticated systems of curfews, checkpoints, walls, permits and land grabs.\\" Selected works=Books= *(2006) Blood and Religion: The Unmasking of the Jewish and Democratic State.

His main contribution to science was the theory of dominant. Alexey Ukhtomsky was born 13 (25) June 1875 on the family estate of the princes Ukhtomsky (from ancient nobility, going back to the Rjurik period) in the hamlet of Vosloma, near Arefino in the Rybinsk district in the province of Yaroslavl. His parents were the retired officer Alexey Ukhtomskii (1842-1902 ), and his wife Antonina Fyodorovna, n√©e Anfimova (1847 -1913). They had five sons, Alexey, who died in infancy, Vladimir, Nicholas, and the eldest son Alexander, who later became Archbishop Andrey ( 1872-1937), and two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. In June 1876 his father's sister Anna Nikolaevna Ukhtomskaya, who lived in the town of Rybinsk, had just buried her mother, for whom she had cared for many years, and being now alone was looking for something to do with her life. Since Antonina Fedorovna was very busy and had insufficient time for her family, on September 27, 1876 Alex was sent away to be raised by his aunt Anna, and in his own words, she was his \\"principal teacher and companion until her death in 1898.\\" In 1888 Alexey, who had not finished grammar school, entered the Nizhny Novgorod Cadet Corps at the urging of his father and mother. There he started to show an interest in science. During this period, the future professor Ivan P. Dolbnya (1853-1912), a mathematics teacher who introduced his students to a wide range of subjects of natural science, had a significant influence on him. Later Ukhtomsky called him \\"someone who teaches you to think.\\" In cadet school Ukhtomsky showed interest not only in the physical and mathematical disciplines, but also in philosophy, psychology, ethics and literature. By age 18, he became acquainted with the writings of Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Feuerbach, James, Hegel, Nietzsche, Kant, and other scientists and philosophers. In 1894, under the influence of his brother Alexander, and on the advice of I.P. Dolbnya Ukhtomsky entered the philological department of the Moscow Theological Academy. He did not live in a dorm, but in an apartment, that was kept comfortable by Nadezhda Bobrovskaya, who lived with him as an assistant and housekeeper until May 1941. As a young student of the Theological Academy, Ukhtomsky spent a month and a half in the department for chronically ill of the Yaroslavl mental hospital. He considered the years spent in the academy as most happy and productive for his spiritual development. The subject of his thesis was \\"The cosmological proof of the existence of God\\". There he proposed the idea of the unlimited possibilities of the human mind, and the uniqueness of each individual. In his academy years Ukhtomsky conceived the idea to identify the natural foundations of human moral behavior, and to find the physiological mechanisms by which the human personality develops in its full diversity. Ukhtomsky became a doctoral candidate of theology. Later, in his autobiography Ukhtomsky wrote: \\"my Ph.D. thesis put closer study of the physiology of the brain, neural activity in general, as well as the physiology of behavior, firmly on the agenda.\\" Upon graduating from the academy, he chose not to pursue an ecclesiastical career. He joined the Russian Orthodox sect of the Old Believers (more precisely the Old Ritualists) (his estate Vosloma had always been inhabited by Old Believers). He wanted to become a physiologist, but since graduates of the theological academies and seminaries were not entitled to enter the university departments of natural sciences, he joined the Department of Oriental Studies instead. From 1899 Ukhtomsky was a guest student at the Oriental Department of St. Petersburg University, where he mastered the Hebrew language. The following year he was among the regular students of the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg State University, studying physiology (while he was not allowed to start in this department, transfer from another faculty was not prohibited). In 1902 he began to his specialization under Professor N.E. Vvedensky. Since 1909 he collaborated with Vvedensky in research on reflex antagonists. In 1911 he defended a thesis on the topic \\"On the dependence of motor cortical effects on the central collateral effects\\" in which he outlined the results of five years of experiments. This was the first time he formulated the principle of the dominant focus, developed later in 1921 and in subsequent years. After defending his thesis he taught for five years in the Psychoneurological institute (now the I.I. Mechnikov Northwestern State Medical University). In December 1917, after participating in the Local Council of the Orthodox Church, Ukhtomsky left for Rybinsk, where he lived in his parental home almost all of 1918. He spent the time reading religious literature and working on the land around the house. In late 1918 - early 1919, the house was nationalized. In the autumn of 1920 the Rybinsk house was searched, some things were confiscated. Ukhtomsky had arrived in Rybinsk November 25 with documents of the University and the Petrograd Soviet, in which he was elected as a member of its VIth convocation. These documents contained a request to leave him two rooms in his former home, \\"that should not be bourgeois in size and character\\" November 1930 he was arrested by \\"agents of the Rybinsk politburo\\" because, as he acknowledges, of incautious remarks in a conversations in scientific company. The documents from the Petrograd Soviet saved him from immediate execution, and Ukhtomsky was sent to the Yaroslavl political detention center, and then to Moscow in the special branch of the Cheka in the Lubyanka. While in custody, he lectured his fellow inmates on physiology. At the end of January 1921 he was released thanks to the efforts of fellow scientists and he was allowed to keep his former home and had his possessions returned. However, he did not return to Rybinsk. From 1920 he was Head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Natural Sciences. In 1922, after the death of Vvedensky he took charge of the Faculty of Human and Animal Physiology of the University of Petrograd. Since 1935 he was the founding director of the Institute of Physiology of Leningrad State University and from 1937 he was the head of the electrophysiology laboratory of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was head of the biology department at Leningrad University, from 1931 until 1938 he was president of the Leningrad Society of Naturalists. Outside the university, he taught physiology at the Lesgaft Institute, at the Psychoneurological Institute, and at the Rabfak (Workers' Faculty). In 1932 he was awarded the Lenin prize. In 1933 he was elected a corresponding member, and in 1935 a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In the early 1920s Ukhtomsky began to publish on the foundations of the principle of dominance as a new theory of brain function. At the turn of 1923‚Äì1924 years he presented a report at the Second All-Union Congress of Psychoneurologists and Neurophysiologists, in which he put forward the principle of dominance as one of the main factors of central innervation. In 1927 he wrote a monograph \\"Parabiosis and Dominant\\", in which the organic link between the dominant and the basic tenets of Vvedensky‚Äôs theory of parabiosis is explained. In subsequent years, he came to understand the role played by the variation in stability of the physiological substrate in the dominant focus, as expressed in the report of 1934, \\"Excitation, inhibition, fatigue.\\" According to Ukhtomsky, the dominant is a temporary governing center of excitation in the central nervous system, which creates a hidden readiness of the organism to a specific activity, while at the same time inhibiting other reflexes. Ukhtomsky was a monk and a priest. He was a delegate of the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church in 1917-1918, he participated actively in conferences on reunification with the Old Believers, he was an elder of the Old Believer‚Äôs church on Marat street (now the Museum of the Arctic and Antarctic on Marat Street), where he usually led worship. When across the country confiscation of church property started, and his parishioners tried to hide the valuables, Ukhtomsky was arrested, but nothing came of it and he was soon released, when he pledged to stop religious propaganda. Ukhtomsky had command of seven languages, was versed in theology, philosophy, political economy, architecture, was a painter of icons, and played the violin. In 1941 Ukhtomsky remained in besieged Leningrad, where he participated in the organization of scientific work in support of its defense, and directed research on traumatic shock that was relevant for warfare. He died August 31, 1942, without having read the proofs of a report titled \\"The system of reflexes in ascending order.\\", which he prepared a week before his death. He was buried at the Literatorskie Mostki cemetery. The theory of the dominant focus Ukhtomsky‚Äôs work on the dominant focus is generally considered his most important discovery. The theory is capable of explaining some of the fundamental aspects of behavior and mental processes of man. The Dominant principle is described in his paper ‚ÄùThe dominant as operating principle of nerve centers‚Äù and other scientific works. This principle was a development of N.E. Vvedensky‚Äôs ideas. The Ukhtomsky borrowed the term ‚Äùdominant‚Äù from Richard Avenarius book ‚ÄùCritique of Pure Experience\\". In a footnote to the paper ‚ÄùThe dominant as operating principle of nerve centers‚Äù Ukhtomsky writes: I use this term in the sense of Avenarius : \\"In the competition of dependent vital series, one of them must be regarded as the dominant for a given moment, and the overall behavior of the individual will then be determined in that direction.‚Äù By ‚Äúdominant\\" Ukhtomsky and his followers understood \\" a more or less stable focus of increased excitability, evoked in whatever way, and stimuli newly arriving at the centers of excitation serve to amplify (reinforce) excitation in this focus, while in the rest of the central nervous system inhibition spreads widely. \\" The theory of the dominant focus has outgrown the framework of physiology and became a trend in the whole Russian philosophical anthropology, and has also been applied in a psychologically oriented literary criticism. \\"I believe that real human happiness will be possible only after future man will be able to foster in himself the capability to switch to the life experience of another person, when the dominant in the face of the other is fostered in each of us\\" A.A.

It was founded in autumn 1969 by a split in the student-worker movement of Turin, which had started militant activity at the universities and factories such as Fiat. The first issue of Lotta Continuas eponymous newspaper was published in November 1969, and publication continued until 1982 after the organization disbanded in 1976. Focusing Lotta Continua focused on spreading radicalisation from students and youth to workers, and played a large role in setting up social centres. Its influence was greatest among recently immigrated, young, unqualified workers in large factories, while the \\"traditional\\" working class kept its allegiance to the Italian Communist Party and the trade union movement. Among the newspaper's enduring features was Roberto Zamarin's comic strip \\"Gasparazzo\\", which poignantly and humorously related the struggles of a worker at a Fiat plant.Nicola Pizzolato, \\"Revolution in a Comic Strip: Gasparazzo and the Identity of Southern Migrants in Turin, 1969‚Äì1975,\\" Humor and Social Protest, ed. Dennis Bos and Marjolein 't Hart (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008) The group's leadership included Adriano Sofri, Mauro Rostagno, Guido Viale, Giorgio Pietrostefani, Erri De Luca, Paolo Brogi and Marco Boato. Other notable contributors included Gad Lerner and Alexander Langer. Since Italian law required that every newspaper needed a professional journalist to act as its managing editor, for some time Pier Paolo Pasolini lent his name in order to allow Lotta Continua's publication.Pasolini in tribunale At first a loose grouping with a focus on spontaneous action, it was centralised between 1972 and 1974, with its paper becoming a daily. As opportunities became more limited, it disbanded in 1976 after a national congress characterized by a severe ideological clash between male and female militants. At that time, Sofri and others embraced electoral politics, while some militants joined terrorist organizations, including Prima Linea and the Red Brigades. The newspaper was published until 1982. During the 1980s, most of Lotta Continua 's representatives abandoned their original ideology. Marco Boato and Mimmo Pinto went to the Radical Party, others worked on TV (RAI or Fininvest) or in various newspapers. Many joined the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), supporting in particular Bettino Craxi's positions. Erri De Luca became a famous writer after joining various humanitarian organizations. Only a few of them, such as Marco Revelli and Fulvio Grimaldi, joined Rifondazione Comunista.  Controversies  * On 17 May 1972 the Milan police commissioner, Luigi Calabresi, thought by Lotta Continua to be responsible for Giuseppe Pinelli\`s death, was killed. Adriano Sofri and Giorgio Pietrostefani, former leaders of Lotta Continua, were sentenced to long prison sentences for organizing the murder, and Ovidio Bompressi and Leonardo Marino for carrying it out, after legal proceedings which were regarded by some as controversial. Ovidio Bompressi is one of the few political activists who has been pardoned (in May 2006) by Italian president Giorgio Napolitano (Democrats of the Left, DS) because of health reasons. * On 11 March 1977 Francesco Lorusso, a militant of Lotta Continua was killed in Bologna. * On 1 October 1977, during a protest march in Turin, activists allegedly attacked a bar with Molotov cocktails. Roberto Crescenzio, a 23-year-old student, died of burns sustained in this attack. Lotta Continua militants were accused of committing this attack, but were eventually cleared in court.

JIJ advances human rights and civil justice, advocates in the Courts of Israel, the Israeli Knesset, international governments, academia and mainstream media forums in Israel and across the globe. The institute assists weakened populations, such as Holocaust survivors, women, men and children that are trapped in the sex industry, IDF soldiers with no homes or families, and religious and ethnic minority groups. The Institute was founded in 2004 and since then has handled over 800 cases dealing with religious freedom in Israel. Main areas of operation=Human Rights Advocacy= JIJ has already had a sustaining impact on human rights advocacy in Israel and the region. Members of the institute have lobbied successfully before the European Parliament, the UN Human Rights Council, as well as the parliaments of Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and France, petitioning them to reconsider what was perceived by JIJ members as irresponsible policies of funding the Palestinian Authority. Furthermore, JIJ conducted research and interviews and drafted in-depth reports on human rights abuses committed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. The findings were submitted to several leading international bodies as well as different universities around the world, among which are Oxford, MIT, Toronto University, University of California Berkeley, Helsinki University, Uppsala University and many others. JIJ is a leading force in combating Anti-Semitism, with a current focus on the BDS movement, mainly through distributing the results of JIJ's research through social media campaigns, reports and public speaking events. =Weakened Populations= The Jerusalem Institute of Justice provides assistance to IDF lone soldiers. Lone soldiers are young men and women who have no family support or a place to return to over weekends; most of these soldiers stay in \\"soldier homes\\" provided by the IDF. JIJ provides weekly Shabbat meals, holiday celebrations, additional humanitarian assistance as well as leisure activities. One of the most significant achievements by JIJ in this field was securing a positive decision at the Knesset to significantly improve the living conditions of Lone Soldiers in Israel. Besides lone soldiers, JIJ offers humanitarian as well as legal assistance to Holocaust survivors, individuals of an Ethiopian descent and other populations in need. =Promoting Human Dignity and Combating Human Trafficking= The Jerusalem Institute of Justice is promoting an anti-prostitution bill based on the Nordic Model in Israel. This will criminalize the clients of the sex industry and stop the abuse of the people trapped in prostitution. JIJ is part of the \\"Coalition for Combating Prostitution and Human Trafficking\\" and has an ongoing presence in the Knesset Subcommittee for combating human trafficking and prostitution. JIJ holds extensive online campaigns to change Israeli ideas on issues regarding human dignity and prostitution, as well as working in partnerships with schools. In August 2016, JIJ was a main partner in arranging a memorial protest rally in Tel-Aviv, which called for the implementation of the Nordic Model and for the criminalization of prostitution in Israel. The rally took place in front of a well-known strip club in the city, infamous for its offering of sex services. =Ethnic and Religious Equality= The Jerusalem Institute of Justice has successfully handled over 800 legal cases to date and has won 22 petitions before the Israeli Supreme Court, handling issues of family reunification, citizenship and more. On January 14, 2012 the Jerusalem Institute of Justice petitioned the Israeli High Court of Justice to overturn Amendment 17, a law passed in 2010 granting synagogues a 100% exemption on municipal property taxes on the grounds that the exclusive application of the amendment to synagogues was undemocratic. Due to JIJ's petition, on August 2, 2012, the Knesset officially extended Amendment 17 to include all houses of worship and religious studies. =Internship and Research= The Jerusalem Institute of Justice has an active internship program with on average 40 interns a year. The interns come to Israel from different parts of the world, and engage in the institute's activity in different areas, from social media management, legal and political research to monitoring hostile activities online as well as offline.

Both nations are members of the G-20 major economies, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the United Nations.  History =1821-1860= Anonymous painting depicting the Battle of Puebla in 1862, located at the Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones. In 1821, soon after obtaining independence from Spain, Emperor Agust√≠n de Iturbide of Mexico sent his foreign minister to the court of King Louis XVIII of France to ask for recognition of the newly independent nation; however, King Louis XVIII refused to recognize Mexico because of its alliance with Spain.Bilateral relations between Mexico and France (in Spanish) On 26 November 1826, France proposed resolving the problem of recognition by establishing trade relations with a Mexican company, thus establishing unofficial relations with Mexico. It wasn't until September 1830 that France recognized and established diplomatic relations with Mexico after the forced abdication of King Charles X of France and the removal of the House of Bourbon from power. That same year, both nations opened resident diplomatic legations in each countries capitals, respectively. During the early years of their diplomatic relations, Mexico and France were not always on friendly terms, particularly with the beginning of the Pastry War (November 1838 - March 1839), known also as the First French intervention in Mexico; where France invaded Mexico in order to collect re- compensation for property damaged and or looted by Mexican forces. During the war, France (with the assistance of the United States) blockaded Mexican ports thus crippling the economy. Three months later, Mexico agreed to pay France 600,000 pesos in compensation.The Pastry War (Mexico vs. France, 1838-1839) =1861-1867= In December 1861, Emperor Napoleon III invaded Mexico on a pretext that Mexico had refused to pay its foreign debt, though in retrospect, Emperor Napoleon III wanted to expand his empire in Latin-America and this became known as the Second French intervention in Mexico. After a successful French invasion of Mexico, Napol√©on III installed his Austrian cousin, Maximilian I of Mexico of the House of Habsburg, as Emperor of Mexico in 1864.Emperor Maximilian of Mexico For several years, Mexican rebels under President Benito Ju√°rez fought against French and royalist troops. Once the Union won the American Civil War in 1865, the U.S. allowed supporters of President Ju√°rez to openly purchase weapons and ammunition and issued stronger warnings to Paris. The United States sent general William Tecumseh Sherman with 50,000 combat veterans to the Mexican border to emphasize that time had run out on the French intervention. Napoleon III had no choice but to withdraw his outnumbered army in disgrace. Emperor Maximilian refused exile and was executed by the Mexican government in 1867 in Quer√©taro thus ending the Second Mexican Empire. The events of the 1860 are commemorated in both France and Mexico to this day. In Mexico, Cinco de Mayo commemorates the Mexicans' victory over the French troops at the Battle of Puebla (5 May 1862). Another defeat of the French ‚Äì the destruction of the small, but heroic, French Foreign Legion force at the Battle of Camar√≥n (30 April 1863) ‚Äì is annually commemorated by the French Foreign Legion as the \\"Camerone Day\\". =Revolution= Sculpture of Louis Pasteur donated by the French community of Mexico City in celebration of Mexico's Centennial of Independence. In 1911, Mexican President Porfirio D√≠az, a former general who fought against the French during the Second French Intervention in Mexico and a Francophile, left Mexico for exile in Paris where he died in 1915 and is buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery. In December 1926, the Mexican government purchased property on Avenue du Pr√©sident-Wilson and on Rue de Longchamp which are now the current Residence and embassy of Mexico in Paris. During World War II, Mexico severed diplomatic relations with the government of Vichy France and instead maintained diplomatic relations with the French government in exile (also known as Free France) led by General Charles de Gaulle in London. Full diplomatic relations were restored between both nations at the end of the war in Europe in 1944. = XXI century = In December 2005, a French citizen called Florence Cassez was arrested in Mexico and charged with kidnapping, organized crime and possession of firearms. She was found guilty by a Mexican court and sentenced to 60 years imprisonment. Cassez always maintained her innocence which began a diplomatic dispute between Mexico and France. At the time, President Nicolas Sarkozy asked the Mexican government to allow Cassez to serve her sentence in France, however the requests were denied.Florence Cassez released in Mexico In 2009, Mexico cancelled its participation of 2011 \\"The Year of Mexico in France\\" (350 events, films, and symposium planned) as the French president Sarkozy declared that this year-long event was going to be dedicated to Cassez, and each individual event would have some sort of remembrance of the Frenchwoman.France's dispute with Mexico over Florence Cassez moves from diplomatic arena to cultural stage In January 2013, the Mexican Supreme Court ordered her release and Cassez was flown immediately back to France. Since her release, France pledged to assist Mexico in creating a Gendarmerie in Mexico at the request of President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.Pe√±a formaliza apoyo de Francia para crear Gendarmer√≠a Nacional (in Spanish) On 6 July 2017, Presidents Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and French President Emmanuel Macron met in Paris, before the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.

In 1996 Gingras became a regular member of Robert Wilson's creative team, developing and performing TSE, The Days Before, Prometheus, 70 Angels on the Facade and Relative Light among others, all over the world. Since 1996 he lived in Europe and the Netherlands. Gingras began his activities as a choreographer in the Netherlands in 1999. After an extensive career in dance and theatre, his desire to explore a highly physical and visual language began to manifest itself. His exploration of movement finds its inspiration in martial arts, freerunning, the physical symptoms related to specific medical conditions, and in post-modern dance and theatre. His desire is to interface dance with the visual and digital arts and to engage audiences in a dialogue based in contemporary issues.

November 1, 2013 Earliest hospitals In 1900, a smallpox epidemic struck Tulsa. Surgeon Fred S. Clinton and four Tulsa businessmen (J. H. McBirney, Sam H. McBirney, Vic Pranter and Jack Dietz) set up a hospital for contagious patients in a six room cottage near Archer Avenue and Greenwood Street. Clinton was the acknowledged leader, while the other four each invested fifty dollars to equip the facility and served as trustees. After the epidemic had passed, the facility was used for other types of patients. The facility closed after only one year of operation, apparently without even receiving a formal name.Tulsa County Medical Society. \\"A History of Tulsa Hospitals\\" Retrieved December 1, 2012. After closure of the Archer Avenue facility, Clinton recognized the need to establish a real hospital for the rapidly growing city. He called town meetings and gave speeches for five years. In 1906, he and several other doctors organized and incorporated the Tulsa Hospital Association. He was elected president, C. L. Reeder was Secretary and C. Z. Wiley was Treasurer. The association leased a two and one- half story residence on North Cheyenne, where it opened the Tulsa Hospital. In December 1906, the hospital moved to a ten-room building at the corner of West 5th Street and Lawton Avenue. The hospital had 40 beds, a private ambulance, long-distance telephone service and was located on a street car line. The first nursing school was established at the Tulsa Hospital. It was directed by Mrs. Henrietta Ziegler. The first class of four nurses graduated in 1910. Clinton remained as president until 1915, when control was sold to other interests. This hospital closed after World War I. Oklahoma Hospital In 1915, Clinton headed a new group of professional and civic leaders in establishing the Oklahoma Hospital at West 9th Street and Jackson Avenue. This was a new brick building with a capacity of 50 patients and having a three- room surgery. The hospital did not open until late in 1916, because World War I interrupted the supply of many critical materials. Mrs. Henrietta Ziegler followed Clinton from the Tulsa Hospital and created a new nursing school at Oklahoma Hospital. Tulsa Hospital declined after the construction of St. Johns Hospital in the 1920s. It was eventually converted and converted to a facility for treating nervous and mental disorders. In 1943, it was purchased by a group of osteopathic physicians and became the 200-bed Oklahoma Osteopathic Hospital. Oklahoma Osteopathic Hospital OSU writes that the first osteopathic hospital in Tulsa was opened in 1924 at 14th and Peoria Ave. by C. D. Heasley, who named it the Tulsa Clinic Hospital. Three years later, Healey moved the facility to a 25-bed converted apartment building at 1321 South Peoria. The hospital was later sold and renamed Byrne Memorial Hospital. This hospital was owned and managed by Mrs. Bessie Byrne. Clinton proposed to John W. Orman, president of the Osteopathic Hospital Founders Association, that the OHFA buy the 9th and Jackson building. In 1925, the building had been bought by the Delaware Baptist Convention and sold again later in 1933 during the depths of the depression. For several years prior to the mortgage foreclosure in 1942 it had become known as Tulsa General Hospital and West Side Hospital. The hospital became a non-profit and was renamed Tulsa Regional Medical Center. It was sold to Columbia/HCA, a for-profit company from Nashville, Tennessee in 1996, which sold it to Hillcrest Medical Center in 1999. It became part of the Oklahoma State University Medical Center in 2006. Morningside/Hillcrest complex Morningside Hospital was created in 1918 because of an influenza epidemic. This hospital began in a brick building at 512 North Boulder Avenue. After the epidemic had subsided, additional money was raised and used to remodel and better equip the hospital. It soon became one of the city‚Äôs leading institutions, attracting many younger physicians to its medical staff. An addition built in 1923-4, bringing the capacity to 80 beds. By 1925, Morningside was owned by Mr. and Mrs. William J. McNulty, who decided to build a new complex at 16th and Utica (the present site), which opened in February 1928.(Editor's Note: the hospital site was actually at 12th and Utica.) The Great Depression caused the complex to become financially strapped. The business was reorganized as a community hospital in 1939, and renamed Hillcrest Hospital. It hired Bryce Twitty as the new Administrator. Ardent Health Services, based in Nashville, Tennessee, bought the Hillcrest Health Care System in 2004 for a reported $281.2 million. In 2011, Hillcrest bought SouthCrest Hospital in Tulsa and Claremore Regional Hospital.Muchmore, Shannon. \\"Hillcrest parent company Ardent Health Systems sold to Chicago-based investment trust.\\" Tulsa World.

Ascension St. John Medical Center A Roman Catholic order, Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother, intending to build a hospital, acquired a tract of land in 1919 at 21st Street and Utica Avenue. Fund raising drives started almost immediately. The groundbreaking ceremony occurred in February 1920 and featured General John J. Pershing. The initial funds proved inadequate and construction stopped. Another fundraising drive was held in February 1921 and work resumed in 1922. Now named Ascension St. John Medical Center, it admitted its first patients in 1924, while the facility was only partially complete. Another fundraising drive was needed to complete the facility in 1926. Despite its financially troubled beginning, St. John not only survived, but grew to become the largest hospital in Tulsa. St. John Medical Center, located in an 11-story midtown center, employs nearly 700 doctors. It continues to operate until the present. A major expansion in 1957 included two more wings, a parking garage, a physical services building and a new residence for members of the order in charge of the complex. A more recent building program will replace all the pre-1945 facilities. A 10-story tower will serve most of the patient, visitor and staff personnel needs. On Monday, 10 February 2020, Ascension St. John Medical Center's parent company, Ascension, kicked off a series of celebratory events, wrapping up a three-year national rebranding effort that includes unifying all of its hospitals under one name Previously, on April 1, 2013, St. John Health System (SJHC) issued the following press release regarding its decision to join Ascension Health: \\"St. John is pleased to officially become part of the Ascension Health family.

His reputed time of rule coincides with a dramatic increase in Viking invasions that ultimately led up to the Viking Occupation of Brittany that began after his death. He is believed to have been named Count of Cornouaille by Alan I, King of Brittany near the end of his reign in 907. After Alan I's death in 907 he disputed the right of Alan's heirs to rule Brittany and fought for the control of the kingdom, albeit without claiming the title king.

Above these carbon cliffs, which comprise the ancient massif, is a plateau of sandstones from the Pliocene (5 Ma.), and in Castelejo and Cordoama, consolidated dunes from the Pleistocene (1.8 Ma). In the Triassic and Jurassic formations there are eruptions of faults from volcanic eruptions during the formative processes. The Mediterranean climate is heavily influenced by the Atlantic Ocean.

Its name was so chosen for the fact that the region had rich fertile soils, and that Bishop Sisnando, Bishop of Porto, had lived in the region during several years. A convent existed in the region, the Convent of Santa Maria de Vila Boa do Bispo, an important monastery of the Convent of the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine (the Cr√∫zios). It was founded by Moninho Viegas in 990, responding to a process made during the battle of Valboa, where he captured the castle of Monte de Arados. The convent church was consecrated by Bishop Nonego, Bishop of Porto, and its first abbey was Rosardo, a native of France. The aforementioned Sisnando, was the successor of Nonego, and, after battling the Moors for several years, he resigned his commission in Porto and escaped to the convent, in the area that would then be named for his location (from 1030 to 1035). The convent was retired/closed in 1605, but the deacon Andr√© Carneiro de Vasconcelos, known as the o Bravo (The Brave) did not accept the closure. He continued to stay on in the convent, with more liberty began to hunt, following his time in prayer and meditation. The convent continued to obtain its income from the parishes in its vicinity, including S. Louren√ßo do Douro, Paredes de Viadores, V√°rzea do Douro, S. Gens de Boelhe (Penafiel), S. Miguel de Bairros (Castelo de Paiva), S. Tiago de Pa√ßos (in the bishopric of Lamego), and, naturally, Vila Boa do Bispo. With the exception of a short period when it was under the commandery system (its last commander was Miguel de Almeida), the Canons Regular lived at the convent until 1740. After this period it was occupied by Jesuits, until the attempted murder of King Jose I, when they were expelled by the Marquess of Pombal, and their possession abrogated to the Crown. It was sold, and began to be held by property-owners. At one time, the cult of S√£o Vicent of Lisbon alleging their connection to the Canons Regular, took action to recover the convent, but their demands were dismissed in court. The parochial church of Vila do Bispo, dating to the 17th century, is part of the convent's former possessions. The former cult occupied a smaller church, in ruins on the church grounds. The new church is tall and spacious, with a chapel decorated in azulejo tile in the Renaissance style. Geography It is situated on the eastern slopes of the Rosem mountains, confronted by the civil parishes of Sande, S. Louren√ßo do Douro, Ariz, S. Paio de Fav√µes, Rosem and Avessadas. At its lowest point is the T√¢mega River, which supported several watermills and proportioned the activity along the river beaches, in particular Festa-e-L√°, in the Praia do Ribeiro de Baixo. The parish is crossed by Lourido River, springing from the Lidrais mountains, that flow into the T√¢mega, and in the high country by the Geloas River, with its spring near Mexide.

She was introduced by executive producer Frank Valentini on September 19, 2012, as the manipulative love interest for Dr. Patrick Drake. Britt is known for her \\"bitchy\\" attitude, characterized as an \\"evil\\" villainess. The term \\"Britch\\" (A combination of Britt and Bitch) has become widely popular when referring to the character, either in the show's script or social media. The role was initially viewed as being pointless and short-term. However, Britt's unfolding storyline‚Äîwhich revealed her to be the daughter of super-villain parents Cesar Faison and Dr. Liesl Obrecht‚Äîhas garnered Thiebaud praise for making her nastiness believable, with Daytime Confidential calling her a \\"natural\\". While enjoying the \\"nasty\\" sides of Britt, Thiebaud was pleased to portray the character's layers. Casting and creation Actress Kelly Thiebaud first auditioned for an unspecified contract role, but the producers of General Hospital felt that she wasn't right for the part. However, they were impressed by her and decided to give her the part of a recurring character that they were in the process of writing, who they characterized as a \\"bitchy\\" doctor. Thiebaud described the casting process as a \\"surprise\\". She debuted as Dr. Britt Westbourne on September 19, 2012. Thiebaud previously had minor acting credits on the NBC soap opera Days of Our Lives and primetime series Criminal Minds. Apart from her acting work, she also modeled and appeared in four music videos for French disc jockey David Guetta. A month into filming, Thiebaud received news that she had been placed on contract. During an interview with Star Pulse, she confessed that she was shocked, because she felt that she wasn't doing well in the role due to nerves, in addition to the fast-paced nature of the genre. In February 2013, Soap Opera Digest confirmed that the actress had been upgraded to a contract status. In early 2013, Thiebaud fractured her femur and was forced to sport crutches. Instead of resting the character, head writer Ron Carlivati wrote it into the script as Britt suffering a fall in the hospital parking lot at the possible hands of Frisco Jones (Jack Wagner), the father of Maxie Jones, whom Britt blackmailed. Thiebaud thanked Carlivati and executive producer Frank Valentini for letting her \\"crutch on TV\\". On the set of General Hospital, Thiebaud met her former real-life boyfriend Bryan Craig, who portrayed Morgan Corinthos. On November 10, 2014, it was reported that Thiebaud had been placed on recurring status following the conclusion of her two-year contract, in order to pursue other acting opportunities. However, it later appeared that Thiebaud would be exiting the series, and her last scenes aired on December 8, with Britt leaving town. Her departure was not confirmed until this date. Upon the airing of her final scenes, the actress revealed on Instagram, \\"I decided not to [re- sign] my contract because I would like to book other roles on prime time shows and film\\", and described her experience on the soap as \\"(sic) a fun and challenging adventure\\". The actress returned for a brief appearance in April 2015. She said that \\"It was just a case of getting used to that [taping] speed again\\", and is open to future appearances. In November 2017, it was revealed that Thiebaud would once again reprise the role for a limited run. She returned on December 8 and departed on December 19. In September 2018, it was reported that Thiebaud would make another return to the show. Thiebaud returned on October 29, 2018. In March 2020, it was announced that Thiebaud was back filming in the role of Britt, returning during the final moments of the March 11, 2020, episode and exited following the April 1, 2020, episode. In August of the same year, it was announced that she would again reprise the role, returning during the September 11, 2020, episode. Character development=Characterization and family= Britt's manipulative, untruthful personality has led her to be nicknamed the \\"Britch\\" or \\"Dr. Britch\\" in the show's dialogue and social media. Thiebaud has stated: \\"I love going to work and getting to play someone that I am not. It‚Äôs really fun to do.\\" She has expressed her pleasure in playing a \\"bad\\" character. Although, despite the fact that she \\"loves playing a villain\\", she stated: \\"I would really love for my character to fall in love, [and] have a romance\\", wanting Britt to \\"redeem herself\\". Thiebaud also hoped that audiences would fall for the character and understand her more. Head writer Ron Carlivati characterized Britt during an interview with Soap Opera Digest as a \\"villainous\\", while On- Air On-Soaps refers to her as an \\"evil Britch\\". Luke Kerr of the entertainment website Zap2it described her as \\"Britchtastic\\", while also acknowledging her \\"human side\\". Britt's \\"nefarious\\" behavior is attributed to her \\"manipulative mother and psycho father,\\" being the daughter of Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) and Dr. Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati); who was involved in the presumed death and kidnapping of Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough). Upon the reveal that Dr. Obrecht was Britt's mother, Thiebaud stated: \\"Recently, my mother got revealed and that was probably something that I'd been waiting for since I got on a contract [...] I wanted to show the audience something other than this kind of bitchy, mean, selfish, conniving person and I'm really glad that slowly these layers are being shown.\\" During an episode of the series, Britt ends up confiding in one of her enemies (and Sabrina's best friend) Felix DuBois (Marc Anthony Samuel), informing him that she is a caring person though has developed an \\"unlikable personality\\" due to her \\"super-villain parents\\", after he calls her a \\"Britch\\" to her face. Thiebaud did not \\"want to play this one layer of her just being a shark and a bitch\\" and was pleased that the character's back-story explained her \\"lack of love, and lack of empathy from other people, and kind of not knowing how to deal with and interact with people\\". She noted that \\"No one is just a bitch. There are always reasons behind that.\\" Upon the character's exit in December 2014, On-Air On-Soaps wrote, \\"Britt was truly a bad girl, a very bad girl, only she ended up humanized along the way.\\" =Relationships and schemes= Liesl and Britt scheme to ensure that Britt will have a relationship with Robin's husband Dr. Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson), though their short-lived romance ends and he began dating Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo), Britt's archenemy. At the 2013 Nurses Ball, she reveals that she is pregnant with Patrick's child, and begins attempting to break up Patrick and Sabrina. Speaking of the brief relationship between Britt and Patrick, Jason Thompson told TV Buzz: \\"I think Patrick and Britt had some real moments in the beginning and he hasn't seen all the things that she's done. I'm not convinced he knows she's as conniving as everyone else says she is.\\" Speaking of the direction for her character, Thiebaud hoped that Robin would return so that there could be \\"that whole showdown\\" that will \\"shake things up incredibly\\". In addition, she hoped that Britt's relationship with Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) would \\"grow closer\\". Thiebaud was a fan of Christopher's and said she was \\"star-struck\\" when she first met him. She felt that Nikolas and Britt's friendship was \\"very special\\", saying: \\"It doesn‚Äôt make any sense why this person would continue to look past her flaws and mistakes, while everyone else want to stay away from Britt. But, Nikolas is continuing to be there for Britt, like no else before has.\\" Britt later moves in with Nikolas and when she goes into labor, Sabrina delivers her baby (after it was revealed that Patrick is not the child's father). She gives birth to a son, Ben. Thiebaud described the scenes where Britt confesses to Patrick that he isn't her baby's father as \\"anxiety-filled and emotion filled\\". Britt later develops a romantic relationship with Nikolas and the couple get engaged. At their engagement party, Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst), another one of Britt's rivals, exposes who Ben's real parents are: Lulu Spencer (Emme Rylan) and Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna); with Britt having stole their embryo. Nikolas breaks up with Britt. The couple rekindle their romance after Britt proves to be a \\"solid support system\\" for Nikolas when his son Spencer (Nicolas Bechtel) goes missing. However, Britt confesses to him that she played a role in Spencer's disappearance to get him back and they break up again. Nikolas presses charges against Britt and she flees town. Head writer Ron Carlivati explained: \\"It was sad, but we had the story set up such that Britt‚Äôs life would have to blow up if Nikolas found out her latest deception. So, we had this escape hatch already when Kelly decided she was not going to sign a new contract.\\" Speaking of Britt's close bond with Spencer, Carlivati said that the relationship \\"is a loss, but it is allowing us to spin Nikolas in a new direction\\". Britt also has a friendship with Brad Cooper (Parry Shen) who had previously played a role in her baby scheme. Carlivati called this an \\"unexpected friendship\\" that the \\"audience really respond to\\", noting that \\"Here these characters started out as schemers, who were sort of using each other, and a real friendship was built.\\" Storylines Dr. Britt Westbourne first appears at General Hospital, where she develops an attraction for fellow doctor Patrick Drake (Jason Thompson), who is still grieving the death of his wife Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough). She is intent on starting a serious relationship with him following a few dates, and appoints nurse Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) to look after his daughter Emma Drake (Brooklyn Rae Silzer). Britt notices that Sabrina has a crush on Patrick, but doesn't view it as a threat, initially. Patrick and Sabrina develop feelings for each other, which strengthens once he dumps Britt for being rude and calling his daughter names. Britt manipulatively attempts to destroy Sabrina's career as a nurse by blackmailing one of her patients, Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms), into sabotaging Sabrina. The effort fails when Maxie's father Frisco Jones (Jack Wagner) threatens Britt, freeing Maxie of Britt's blackmail. Britt later sets up Sabrina to appear that she cheated on a nursing test, though she is caught and Sabrina graduates as a nurse. Britt ends up getting help from her mother, Dr. Liesl Obrecht (Kathleen Gati), who is even more intent on Britt being with Patrick, threatening to kill her own daughter if she doesn't improve her tactics. To the shock of audiences, it is learned that Britt's father is criminal and longtime GH villain Cesar Faison (Anders Hove). Britt and her mother's master plan is revealed when Britt takes the stage at the Nurse's Ball to inform Patrick, Sabrina, and Emma that she is pregnant with his child. Britt later, with the help of the sleazy lab technician Brad Cooper (Parry Shen), fakes hyperemesis gravidarum so Patrick will take her in, but she instead moves in with Sabrina and fellow nurse Felix Dubois (Marc Anthony Samuel) for her fake bed-rest, inflicting hell on them. However, Britt becomes fast friends with Felix's sister Taylor DuBois (Samantha Logan). A paternity test demanded by Sabrina and Felix seemingly proves that Patrick is the father of Britt's baby, though it is later revealed Dr. Obrecht switched the results, and the child isn't Patrick's. During the middle of this, Britt also befriends Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher), who she develops potential feelings for. When Patrick finds out who Britt's mother is, he tells Britt he's filing for sole custody of the baby. Britt finally admits that she isn't carrying Patrick's baby, and when Patrick presses, she tells him that Brad donated his sperm to her so she could get pregnant. Soon after, she goes into labor, and Sabrina and Nikolas end up delivering her son, whom she names Ben. Obrecht ends up kidnapping Ben soon after he is born, and Nikolas and Britt go to his family compound, Cassadine Island, in Greece when they get a lead on her. There, she finds Faison with her son, and eventually gets Ben back. Britt also finds out Robin is alive and being held captive by her parents. Britt is held hostage with Nikolas and Robin in Port Charles by her parents unless Robin finds a way to cure Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roch√©) of his poisoning. Britt offers to help Robin with this, and finds out Patrick and Sabrina are engaged. Robin becomes desperate to find a cure in order to stop the wedding. Britt's parents are eventually caught, and they're freed. Britt and Nikolas eventually start a relationship after the ordeal. However, Britt's newfound happiness is put in jeopardy by her mother, who blackmails Britt into helping her get released from jail. It's revealed that Britt actually stole the embryos of Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) and Lulu Spencer-Falconeri (Emme Rylan) in order to impregnate herself, and Ben is actually Dante and Lulu's son. Britt is afraid she'll lose Nikolas because Lulu is his sister. After she and Nikolas get engaged, the truth is revealed, and Nikolas dumps Britt. Obrecht steals Ben when the truth is revealed, and tries to help Britt leave town with him. Instead, Britt turns her mother into the police, and gives Ben back to Dante and Lulu. Despondent over losing Ben and Nikolas, Britt drowns her sorrows at the bar, and ends up meeting Nathan West (Ryan Paevey). She stays at his apartment for the night, though they don't sleep together. The next day, she finds out that Nathan is actually her brother, who Liesl gave to her sister and Britt's aunt, Madeline Reeves (Donna Mills), to raise. The two try to form some kind of bond. Liesl also tries to bond with her children, but Britt is not willing to forgive her mother as easily for not just lying, but for belittling her constantly. Britt decides to try and win Nikolas back with the help of his son, Spencer. Spencer disappears, making it look like he was kidnapped, so that Britt can find him and be a hero. Though Britt was not the one who found Spencer, it still drew Nikolas and Britt back together. However, Liesl blackmailed Britt, with Spencer's kidnapping, to help Faison hide from the police. Britt refused, and instead confessed the truth to Nikolas. Furious, Nikolas threatened to call the cops on Britt. She left, and met her parents at the dock, where they were planning to escape together. She decided to go with them, but Obrecht changed her mind and stayed when she found out Nathan was injured. Britt and Faison left Port Charles, going on the run together. Britt briefly returned almost a year later to watch the Nurses' Ball with Brad, and catch up with Obrecht. She also visited Spencer, who was recovering from injuries sustained during a fire, before departing Port Charles again. In 2017, Britt is located by Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), when she is questioned concerning the whereabouts of Faison; following, Britt returns to Port Charles and turns herself into the PCPD, where she is then escorted off to prison. The following year, she agrees to help Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) track down her mother, in exchange for her release from prison. With the assistance of Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton), Britt is able to convince Obrecht to return to Port Charles; following her mother's capture and her own release, Britt leaves town. In March 2020, Britt returns to Port Charles, surprising Brad at his court hearing; upon her return, she is temporarily re-hired back at General Hospital, following the re-instatement of her medical license, as an interim replacement for Kim Nero (Tamara Braun). She leaves town upon receiving and accepting a job offer in Boston. In September, Britt returns to Port Charles again where she becomes the Chief of Staff at General Hospital by Chairman of the Board Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober) from Seattle in the Pacific Northwest who bores an uncanny resemblance to her late father. Reception On-Air On-Soaps wrote that the actress \\"won fans and critics alike over with her multi- dimensional performance as Dr. Britt Westbourne\\". Speaking of the character's progression, soap journalist Michael Fairman said she went from \\"the ultimate bitch, to being pregnant, to now actually having many fans rooting for her\\". Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential was receptive of the character, and upon news of Thiebaud being placed on contract with the series, wrote: \\"I couldn't be happier about this news. While I didn't see the point of Britt or Sabrina early on, the story has hooked me over the past few weeks. [Thiebaud] is a natural at playing a bitch-goddess-in-training.\\" Brittany Frederick of Star Pulse said of Thiebaud: \\"With her positive energy and commitment to her craft, Kelly is well on her way to a long career.

In a poll conducted by About.com in regards to which General Hospital storyline viewers were most interested, the option of \\"How Robin's kidnapping ties in with Britt hooking up with Patrick\\" received the most votes, with 27%. Luke Kerr (also of Zap2it) was receptive of Britt's potential pairing with the character Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) stating that \\"A Faison and Cassadine romantic pairing could be hot\\" and they \\"could become Port Charles‚Äô next, great twisted power couple\\". The humorous side of Britt's inability to get along with Patrick's daughter Emma was demonstrated when Britt accidentally throws Emma's wet doll (named Baby Ariel) into a grill, causing it to catch fire during a 4th of July barbecue. The scene was shown on the E! television series The Soup!, which recaps popular culture television moments of the week. Presenter Tim Jennings stated: \\"Not everyone is good with kids [...] In fact, if you don‚Äôt have one and aren‚Äôt used to interacting with them, a conversation with a random child can end up feeling awkward. If this ever happens to you, don‚Äôt despair. At the very least, it will never be as bad as what happened to Britt on ‚ÄòGeneral Hospital‚Äô this week\\". Jennings jokingly stated: \\"Don‚Äôt worry, Baby Ariel. Soaps always bring characters back from the dead.\\" The scene has been described as an \\"instant classic\\". Later, Violette DeSantis of SheKnows Media compiled a poll of characters that have \\"been pulling at our heartstrings. Characters we like and dislike have shared their intimate thoughts. While watching a few confront their inner demons or confess their feelings to others we might have felt deeply moved to hug one or two of them\\", with Britt included.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Britt Westbourne at She Knows Soaps *Britt Westbourne at Soap Central General Hospital characters Fictional physicians Fictional obstetricians and gynaecologists Television characters introduced in 2012 Female characters in television Fictional female doctors ","title":"Britt Westbourne"},{"id":"38574061","text":"The Chronicle of the Saxons () is a Welsh-language chronicle running from 683 to 1197.Turner, Sharon.

Link-Systems International, Inc. (LSI) is a privately held American distance-learning software corporation based in Tampa, Florida. The company is best known for NetTutor, its online tutoring service; WorldWideTestbank, its platform for authoring online content; and its WorldWideWhiteboard education- focused online collaboration platform. History Link-Systems International was founded in 1995, then incorporated in the state of Florida on February 27, 1996. It started as an internet content authoring and repurposing service. For several years, LSI performed the conversion of scholarly content such as journals from earlier print-oriented formats to a format for Web display. Link-Systems International, Inc. ranked 3396 on the Inc. 5000 list in 2014. =WorldWideWhiteboard (formerly NetTutor): 1997= In 1997, LSI released \\"NetTutor\\", a Java-based application. The online educational interface allowed participants and a \\"leader\\" to collaborate in real time. When the leader drew or placed text, figures, or symbols, such as square-root and integral signs, on a virtual whiteboard, content would be simultaneously displayed on all users' screens. Other participants can \\"raise their hands\\" and be recognized by the leader, who can grant them access to draw or type on the whiteboard area. A secondary, instant messaging-style text area allows text-only communication. LSI leased this interface, mainly to schools and textbook publishers, renaming the platform WorldWideWhiteboard in 2001, in order to distinguish it from its online tutoring service, which retained the NetTutor name. =NetTutor: 1998= LSI launched the NetTutor online tutoring service in 1998. NetTutor uses the WorldWideWhiteboard and a proprietary queuing system. Students who log in gain access to professional tutors who provide assistance in specific subject areas. NetTutor employs its tutors on a full- time basis at LSI headquarters in Tampa. (Other online tutoring services employ part-time tutors and allow them to tutor from any physical location.) Another distinction between NetTutor and other services is that a set of written guidelines is drawn up in consultation with client institutions and amended as needed. Such guidelines reinforce tutoring best practices, such as that tutors should prefer the Socratic method and scaffolding over simply answering questions. However, they also can be used to instruct tutors to adopt special practices preferred by the client. Some examples of tutoring guidelines are available on the Web. =Content authoring and the WorldWideTestbank: 2002= LSI developed the WorldWideTestbank platform for creating a wide variety of problem-types. True-false, multiple choice, and free input are the traditional ones, but the WorldWideTestbank also supports graphical and manipulative problem-types. The interface development environment of the WorldWideTestbank supports authors' programming in the platform's own scripting language and creates a \\"template\\" for each question. Depending on how it is programmed, a single template can yield an indefinite number of problems for a user to practice by inserting randomly selected numbers and phrases in each instance of the template. The WorldWideTestbank also enables an instructor to specify how close the student has to be to an exact correct answer to be \\"correct.\\" For instance, in numerical answers, students may be required to express answers with a specific number of significant digits. =IVS and MyAcademicWorkshop: 2010= In 2010, LSI released two platforms: an educational institution analytics platform called Information Visibility Solutions‚Ñ¢ (IVS) and a homework and assessment platform that combined features of the WorldWideTestbank and WorldWidewGradebook with an optional connection to tutoring called MyAcademicWorkshop‚Ñ¢. IVS applies the alerts and notices features common in gradebook applications, but at an enterprise level and with user-definable dashboards. For IVS, which bridges different databases in which an institution may hold its data to display interrelated events about a college campus as the events are occurring, LSI collaborated with Mindshare, Inc. in nearby Clearwater, Florida, a company that already had developed analytics for the state of Florida; MyAcademicWorkshop enables schools to place students into one of a number developmental math courses and provides content for these courses aligned to state or national standards. =HTML5 and Mobile Readiness: 2012= In 2012, LSI began replacing the original, Java-based code of its platforms with HTML5 so that its various platforms are more accessible and can be used on mobile devices. As of 2015, the WorldWideWhiteboard, NetTutor, and the WorldWideTestbank have been re-released in HTML5. =Comfit and RTR: 2014= By May 2014, LSI completed acquisition of the ComFit Online Learning Center. ComFit uses an initial set of questions to try to pinpoint students' difficulties in reading and English, after which students work problems and win \\"medals\\" as they progress through learning goals. In contrasts to the adaptive placement of MyAcademicWorkshop, which assigns a student to a course and emphasizes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), ComFit focuses on specific sets of learning goals and emphasizes English and writing objectives. Also in 2014, LSI developed an automated tutoring referral system called Refer-Tutor-Report‚Ñ¢ (RTR‚Ñ¢). RTR accommodates four activities: teachers refer chosen students to tutoring for specified learning objectives, students receive notification of referrals and learn how to reach tutors, tutors find out what learning objectives students need to cover, and administrators garner reports about the tutoring referral process. LSI Clients=Educational Institutions= Use of LSI platforms is part of a general turn by higher-education institutions to online instruction and student support. The WorldWideWhiteboard went online at Pima Community College and other institutions even before 2000. NetTutor, initially offered with new editions of textbooks in deals with publishing companies, is now available in community college systems and universities like the California Community College System (through the Online Education Initiative), Mississippi's Virtual Community College System, and the Oregon State University eCampus. Many individual college campuses have adopted NetTutor or the WorldWideWhiteboard. At some schools, the collaborative whiteboard is used by campus tutors who conduct online tutoring. In a few cases, NetTutor becomes available automatically during hours when campus online tutoring is unavailable. =Publishers= LSI, through its content conversion services and conferencing and tutoring tools, became an early partner to textbook publishers. The NetTutor service was adopted as a value-added feature on new textbooks, whereby purchasers of the textbooks gained access to a certain number of hours of online tutoring. NetTutor has been packaged over the years with textbooks published by John Wiley and Sons, Pearson, Cengage Learning, and Bedford-St. Martin's, an imprint of MacMillan. LSI content authors have created material that appears in the homework systems associated with McGraw- Hill, Cengage Learning, MacMillan, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and in such tools as MyMathLab and WebAssign. Education Research and LSI Platforms Recent research compares the performance of college students who use NetTutor to those who do not, and finds evidence that both performance and persistence improve among users of the service. In other cases, schoolshttp://online.umsystem.edu/docs- policies/Report_on_Online_Tutoring_Services.pdf, July 7, 2010Chikao Tsubaki (2010). \\"A Comparison of Two Online Tutoring Modes.\\" MDLA Forums. March 3, 2010. Retrieved April 22 from http://www- apps.umuc.edu/mdla_forums/showthread.php?t=102. compared NetTutor favorably to its competitors on ground of price and flexibility of tutoring approach. A study at Hampton University concluded in 1999 that the whiteboard could effectively support such activities as online office hours. In 2004, researchers at Stony Brook University concluded that \\"...according to our research NetTutor remains the only workable math-friendly e-learning communication system.\\" A study at Utah Valley University in 2006 pointed out the role of the WorldWideWhiteboard as \\"[o]ne of the earliest synchronous models for math tutoring]\\"). An example of live interaction on the WorldWhiteWhiteboard can be found in the online journal on writing instruction Kairos. By 2007, LSI's NetTutor service had conducted one million online tutorial sessions. LSI and controversies surrounding distance learning software Online technology is shown to help develop a community of inquiry, which has been shown to improve student participation and results. In particular, schools require students enrolling in online courses to complete inventories of personal study practices, since more commitment is required to complete online courses successfully. The relative novelty of online tutoring also raises questions of tutor preparedness to support students on the internet, whether that support is delivered in real time (synchronously) or via exchange of documents (asynchronously)\\"How Do You Feel? Attitudes about Tutoring Online\\", Beth Hewett (2004). Praxis: A Writing Center Journal. 1(2). Retrieved April 29, 2011 from http://projects.uwc.utexas.edu/praxis/?q=node/104 . =User guidelines= LSI platforms are used in conjunction with online instruction, delivery of student support in the online and mobile formats, and to aggregate and notify users about events that generate online data. As such, the school needs to perform due-diligence to ascertain that the technology they intend to offer provides essentially the same academic credentials as school educators. For instance, while technology is documented to yield academic results at least comparable to those of face-to-face services, schools also need to confirm that use of a service or software complies with existing practices of their faculty. To answer this concern, LSI creates, jointly with its schools or publishers, a written set of guidelines called \\"Rules of Engagement\\" (ROE) that can be modified as needed.

History The main line of the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), between and Liverpool Brunswick, opened in 1873. This passed to the north of the growing town of Widnes, so in 1873 the Widnes Railway was projected to link that town to the CLC, at a triangular junction to the west of . A 1909 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (left) railways in the vicinity of Widnes Central In 1874 the uncompleted line was sold to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;); and in 1875 it became the joint property of the MS&LR; and the Midland Railway - two of the partners in the CLC. The third partner, the Great Northern Railway declined to take part in the project, and so it was not part of the CLC but separately administered by the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee. This line opened for goods traffic in 1877. The Widnes line was soon extended westwards to rejoin the CLC near , forming what became known as the Widnes Loop. A passenger station on the extension, known as Widnes Central, was opened on 1 August 1879. The core service at Widnes Central was provided by the trains of the CLC running between and Liverpool Central. In 1922 16 \\"Down\\" (towards Liverpool) trains called on Mondays to Saturdays. Nine ran from Warrington Central, two from Manchester Central, one from Tanhouse Lane and two started at Widnes Central itself, all headed for Liverpool Central. One ran from Tanhouse Lane to Garston but by far the most exotic was the 12:15 from to Liverpool Central which called at Widnes at 19:04. \\"Up\\" services were similar. Two trains each way called on Sundays. The station was closed by British Railways on 5 October 1964. as a result of the Beeching Axe. Services had by then declined significantly from their peak levels in pre-grouping days (15 per day each way in 1922) to just five westbound and six eastbound departures on weekdays & Saturdays only.\\"Disused Stations - Widnes Central\\" Disused Stations; Retrieved 2014-03-20 The entire loop line was closed as a through route soon afterwards, though the freight yard at Tanhouse Lane remained in use for cement traffic until 2000 - access was latterly provided by a connection from the ex-LNWR Widnes Deviation Line.

Local legend suggests the tree is cursed: those who damage or disrespect the tree (usually by urinating on it, or making disparaging remarks about it while nearby) will soon thereafter come to some sort of harm, often in the form of a car accident or major breakdown as they leave.Moran, Mark and Sceurman, Mark; Weird NJ: Your Travel Guide to New Jersey's Local Legends and Best-Kept Secrets, Barnes & Noble, 2003; 14-16.

A common claim is that Bernards Township was one of the central headquarters for the Ku Klux Klan in New Jersey and that the tree had been used to lynch African Americans and rebellious slaves since Colonial times.\\"Tales from the Devil's Tree\\", Weird NJ, May 2006. Another claim is that a farmer hanged himself from the tree after killing his family and that anyone trying to cut the tree down will \\"come to an untimely end\\". Other legends surrounding the tree allege that visitors who get too close to the tree will get chased by a black Ford pick-up truck that will then disappear at a certain point, or that anyone who touches the tree will find that their hands have turned black if they try to eat at a restaurant. In winter, the ground beneath the tree is allegedly free from snow, no matter how much has fallen or how recently.

Protection Chain-link fence around the trunk. The township's plans to develop the land where the tree is located might have required its removal, but the township decided to protect the tree and keep it intact. In 2007, a sign was posted at the site stating when it is open to the public. The Devil's Tree was surrounded by a chain-link fence following vandalism.

In September 1864, General Nathan Bedford Forrest led his force into northern Alabama and middle Tennessee to disrupt the supply of William Tecumseh Sherman's army in Georgia. The battle's site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  Athens (September 23‚Äì24)  On the afternoon of 23 September, Union forces engaged Confederate forces five miles south of Athens, near tanner, where they were destroying a railroad trestle. Forrest's Confederate forces moved towards Athens. That evening the Confederate forces gained control of the town, and the Union forces had retreated within Fort Henderson. The Confederate forces began an artillery barrage on the morning of the 24th. In a personal meeting, Forrest convinced the Union commander, Colonel Wallace Campbell, that the Confederate forces numbered 8,000-10,000. Campbell surrendered the fort and its garrison around noon. Shortly after the garrison had surrendered, reinforcements consisting of about 350 men from the 18th Michigan and 102nd Ohio, commanded by Jonas Elliott, arrived by train from Decatur. After suffering casualties of one-third their total personnel, these forces surrendered.  Sulphur Creek Trestle (September 25)  After defeating the Union forces in Athens, Forrest moved north along the railroad with the intent to destroy a strategic trestle at Sulphur Creek, six miles north of Athens. A fortification, two blockhouses, and a force of 1,000 Union soldiers defended the trestle. On the morning of the 25th, the Confederate forces began an artillery bombardment of the fort. The fortification had been built below the summits of adjacent hills, and thus provided little defense against the bombardment. 200 Union soldiers were killed, including the commander, Colonel William Hopkins Lathrop. By noon, George Spalding had surrendered the remaining 800 soldiers.Sulphur Battle There were no reported Confederate losses.  Aftermath  The Union prisoners were transferred to Confederate prisons.

She is a Louis W. Menk Professor of Psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and director of the University's Infant and Child Development Center (formerly Project on Child Development). She is known for her work on the development of language and concepts in infants and children. Education and career Waxman received her bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1976. She earned her master's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1981 and her doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1985. From 1986 to 1992 she was a faculty member of the psychology department at Harvard University. In 1992 Waxman left Harvard for Northwestern University's Department of Psychology. Along with Douglas Medin, she cofounded Northwestern's Program in Culture, Language, and Cognition in 2000. The program involves several schools and departments at the university, and supports research on the relationships between language, cultural processes, and higher cognitive processes. Waxman also holds a joint appointment in the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern. In 2013, she was elected as Fellow at Northwestern's Institute for Policy Research. Waxman is the recipient of numerous national and international awards. She was awarded a James McKeen Cattell Fellowship to support her work about how young children from different cultures come to understand the natural world, and a Guggenheim Fellowship for her exceptional scholarship. In 2008 she received the Ann L. Brown Award for Excellence in Developmental Research from the University of Illinois. In 2011 she was elected as a fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences in recognition of her contributions to the fields of developmental and cognitive psychology. Research Sandra Waxman is the director of the Infant and Child Development Center at Northwestern University (established 1992), where her research is focused on early linguistic and conceptual development. The primary focus of her work at the Infant and Child Development Center is to examine human infants‚Äô and young children‚Äôs natural ability to build complex, flexible, and creative systems ‚Äì both cognitive and linguistic - and to establish links between them. In a separate but related line of research, Waxman and colleagues investigate how preschool and school-aged children acquire concepts about the natural world. = Early linguistic and conceptual development = Waxman has focused specifically on infants‚Äô acquisition of concepts (e.g., dog, blue, or running) and the words that describe them to establish what cognitive and linguistic capacities are available to infants and young children from the very start, and how they are fine-tuned by the shaping force of their experience.Blackwell Handbook of Language Development (2009). Erika Hoff and Marilyn Shatz, Eds., Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, Ltd. (pp.196-7,225,268). Together with colleagues, she has documented that even before infants begin to speak, their cognitive and language capacities are powerfully linked, and that these early links, which set the foundation for subsequent learning, are shaped importantly by experience ‚Äì including infants' experience acquiring their particular native language. Waxman and colleague Dana Markow's 1995 \\"Words as invitations to form categories: Evidence from 12-month-old infants\\" (Cognitive Psychology, 29, 257-302.) helped establish a foundation for future exploration by other researchers.

This collaborative venture involves children from diverse linguistic and cultural communities in the US (including rural and urban children of European and Native American descent) and abroad (including children from indigenous communities in South America, Central America, and Indonesia). Waxman and her colleagues have found cultural and linguistic differences as well as commonalities in children‚Äôs understandings of the natural world. This work also underscores the vital role of experience in learning. = Implications = Waxman‚Äôs continuing research on the relation between early language and cognitive development in children from diverse linguistic and cultural communities provides a foundation for further applications, including early interventions in atypical development (e.g., language delay) and the promotion of positive developmental outcomes and optimal learning environments for all children. Her continuing work focusing on children and their understanding of the natural world provides a springboard for the development of science education curricula and policy. To design effective science curricula, especially for classrooms that include children from diverse cultural backgrounds, it is important to understand what knowledge children bring to the classrooms, and for curricula to be culturally and linguistically responsive.

Biography  Harold Wolff was born on May 26, 1898 in New York City, the only child of Louis Wolff, a catholic illustrator, and Emma Recknagel Wolff, Lutheran. He was educated at City College, from which he graduated in 1918, aged 20. After graduating, he worked in a government-supported fishery trying to improve drying fish.

The objective was to capture the Muslim city of Al-Jazeera Al-Khadra, called Algeciras by Christians. The city was the capital and the main port of the European territory of the Marinid Empire. The siege lasted for twenty one months. The population of the city, about 30,000 people including civilians and Berber soldiers, suffered from a land and sea blockade that prevented the entry of food into the city. The Emirate of Granada sent an army to relieve the city, but it was defeated beside the R√≠o Palmones. Following this, on 26 March 1344 the city surrendered and was incorporated into the Crown of Castile. This was one of the first military engagements in Europe where gunpowder was used. Sources Despite the remarkable significance of the siege and fall of Algeciras, there are few contemporary written sources that recount the events. The most important work is the Chronicle of Alfonso XI, which tells the main events of the reign of King Alfonso XI, and whose chapters describing the siege of Algeciras were written by the royal scribes in the Christian camp. This book recounts in detail the events as seen from outside the city, devoting a chapter to each month. Other Castillian works are the Poem of Alfonso Onceno, called the \\"rhyming chronicle\\", written by Rodrigo Y√°√±ez, and the Letters of Mateo Merced, Vice Admiral of Aragon, with a report to his king on the entry of the troops into the city. All of these sources tell of the siege of the city from the perspective of the besiegers. No accounts of the events as seen from inside the city have survived to modern times. There is a total absence of Muslim sources, perhaps because of the absence of good writers in the city or perhaps due to a desire not to dwell on the loss of such an important city. Translations of some of the few Arabic texts that refer indirectly to the loss of the city are all that is available to cover this aspect of the history of the siege. Background=Moorish threat to Castile= Algeciras was formerly part of the Emirate of Granada. In 1329 the city was taken over by the King of Morocco, who made it the capital of his European domains. Forces from Granada and Morocco recovered the nearby city of Gibraltar in 1333. In 1338 Abd-Al-Malik, son of the king of Morocco and ruler of Algeciras and Ronda, launched raids against the Castilian territories in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. In one of these raids he was killed by Castilian soldiers and his body taken back to Algeciras, where it was buried. Abd-Al-Malik's father Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Othman crossed the strait in 1340, defeated a Spanish fleet and landed in the city. On the grave of his son he swore to defeat the Castilian king. He first went to the town of Tarifa, to which he laid siege. King Alfonso XI of Castile, overwhelmed by the incursions of the new North African force and the possibility of losing the city of Tarifa, gathered an army with the help of King Afonso IV of Portugal. The two armies, Castilian-Portuguese and Moroccan-Granadan, clashed near Tarifa's Los Lances beach in the Battle of R√≠o Salado (30 October 1340). The defeat of the Muslims in this battle encouraged Alfonso XI and convinced him of the need to take the city of Algeciras, since it was the main port of entry of troops from Africa. =Preparations= Strait of Gibraltar during the Siege of Algeciras Torre de los Adalides (Tower of the Champions) Starting in 1341, Alfonso XI began to prepare the necessary troops to lay siege to the city. He ordered construction of several ships and secured the services of the Genoese fleet of Egidio Boccanegra and squadrons from Portugal and Aragon. On land, besides his Castilian troops and troops from Aragon, there were many European crusaders, and he was supported by the kings of England and France. The campaign was financed by extending the alcabala tax on bread, wine, fish, and clothing to include sales of all goods. The courts of Burgos, Le√≥n, √Åvila, and Zamora were called in 1342 to approve the new tax. Alfonso XI met with the Portuguese Admiral Carlos Pessanha in El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a and heard from Pero de Montada, Admiral of the Aragon squadron, that it was heading for Algeciras. He then left for Getares Cove, just from the city, to check the status of the galleys at his disposal. On his arrival at Getares, Pero de Montada informed the king that he had intercepted several ships carrying food to the city, and that the galleys of Portugal and Genoa had engaged eighty Moorish galleys in combat, captured twenty-six of them and forced the others to take refuge in African ports. According to the Castilian knights, this was the time to encircle the city, since it should have limited supplies. The king, however, felt he still had too few troops in place. Most of his forces were in Jerez de la Frontera awaiting his orders, while the troops defending Algeciras had already been warned of their arrival. The king returned to Jerez, assembled his council and informed them of the state of the city. He sent orders to the admirals at Getares to intercept any boats trying to supply the city and to try to capture some Algecire√±o who could inform them about the condition of the two towns. He also sent orders to his almogavars to do the same on land. The king's knights advised him about the best places to establish the main base where the King and nobles would live, and the vulnerable points where they could do most damage to the city's defenses. It was only needed to move troops to Algeciras, build bridges over the Barbate River and over a stream near Jerez, and send ships to the Guadalete River to carry food for the troops. On 25 July 1342 Alfonso XI left Jerez accompanied by his troops and the officials and knights who were to assist him in the siege of Algeciras. These included the Archbishop of Toledo, the Bishop of C√°diz, the Master of Santiago, Juan Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n y Coronel, Pero Ponce de Le√≥n, Joan N√∫√±ez, Master of Calatrava, Nu√±o Chamizo, Master of Alc√°ntara, Fray Alfonso Ortiz Calder√≥n, Prior of San Juan, and the councils of Seville, Cordoba, Jerez, Ja√©n, √âcija, Carmona, and Niebla. On 1 August the Castilian troops and their allies arrived at Getares, comprising a force of 1,600 mounted soldiers and 4,000 archers and lancers. The troops and squadrons of Aragon, Genoa, and Castile took their positions. On 3 August the headquarters were established on a knoll to the north of Algeciras. The king lived in the tower there in the early months of the siege surrounded by the knights and nobles who accompanied him. The Torre de los Adalides (Tower of the Champions), named for that time, gave an excellent view of the Muslim city and of the roads that communicate with Gibraltar and eastern Andalusia. =Algeciras= Location of the Algeciras Villas. North is to the right. Al-Jazeera Al-Khadra was the first city founded by Muslims when they arrived in the Iberian peninsula in 711. In the fourteenth century the city was two separate towns with their own walls and defenses. Between the two towns was the R√≠o de la Miel. The river mouth formed a wide inlet which acted as a natural harbor protected by the Isla Verde Green Island, which the Muslims called Yazirat Umm Al-Hakim. The north town, Al-Madina, called Villa Vieja (\\"old town\\") by the Spaniards, was the oldest of the two and was founded in 711. It was surrounded by a wall with towers and a deep moat protected by a barbican and a parapet. The entrance to the Villa Vieja from the Gibraltar road was protected by a massive gateway called the Fonsario, near the main city cemetery. This entrance was the weakest point of the defensive works and therefore the best defended. The south town, Al-Binya, called Villa Nueva (\\"new town\\") by the Spaniards, was built by the Marinids of Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq in 1285. It was on a plateau that had once held the industrial neighborhood of Iulia Traducta, the Roman Algeciras. The steepness of its perimeter helped its defense, so it was not necessary to build such strong defenses as those of the Villa Vieja. The Villa Nueva housed the fortress and the troops who had been established in the city. Algeciras had about eight hundred horsemen and twelve thousand crossbowmen and archers, with a total population of thirty thousand people, according to information from captives given to the King of Castile in the early days of the siege. Phases of the siege=Opening moves: August 1342 ‚Äì October 1342= Major structures and places named in the text Location of King Alfonso XI during the siege, and of his troops From 3 August 1342, after the main camp had been established, the king of Castile commanded the Royal Engineers to study the places where troops were to be positioned. The main aim was to prevent the departure of troops from the city and the entry of reinforcements from the Tarifa and Gibraltar roads. Algeciras was to fall from hunger rather than by force of arms. Seeing from the city that the siege had not yet been properly organized, the defenders decided to send three hundred men on horseback and a thousand on foot against the Master of Santiago, Juan Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n y Coronel, Pero Ponce de Le√≥n and the Seville Council in the Puerta del Fonsario. The men of the Count of Lous counterattacked. They did not wait for the other Christians, and the Count and his men died under a cloud of arrows when they came too close to the wall. After the king had seen the damage that could be done, in the next few days he had a trench dug around the Villa Vieja from the R√≠o de la Miel to the sea to prevent attacks from the city. Shelters were built next to the trenches and soldiers were posted at regular intervals to stand guard at night. The king moved his headquarters closer to the city and sent several of his men to conquer the Cartagena Tower in the city of Carteia, from where they could observe the movements of the Marinids of Gibraltar. With war between Peter IV of Aragon and the Kingdom of Majorca imminent, the Aragonese fleet left the siege in September 1342. Siege engines were sent to a position near the northwest gate of the city, where two great towers prevented attack and protected the defenders. During construction of these machines, several of the defenders attacked from the Puerta de Xerez to prevent placement of the engines. The Algecire√±os' strategy was to provoke the besiegers into coming closer to the walls. This technique, with which they had killed the Count of Lous, was not known to the Christian knights unaccustomed to the border war, and many men died during the early months of the siege. In the raid on the siege towers, the king's equerry Joan Ni√±o died, as did the Master of Santiago and other men. The siege dragged on, and the King of Castile sent several of his men to seek help in order to maintain the siege. The Archbishop of Toledo was sent to meet with the King of France while the Prior of St. Joan went to call on Pope Clement VI, who had just been installed. The besiegers had more problems than they had expected at the start of the siege. During the first days of October there was a huge storm. The camp in the northwest was sited in a traditionally flooded area, and turned into a swamp. The defenders took advantage of the confusion created by the storm to attack during the night, causing extensive damage. Floods in the camp and in the encircling lines required the headquarters and the larger part of the troops to move to the mouth of the river Palmones, where they spent the remainder of October 1342. Soon after the main Christian camp had moved, the Algecire√±os gathered all their forces in the Villa Vieja to make a desperate attack against their besiegers. The Muslim knights were able to reach the newly established Christian camp and kill many Christian knights including Gutier D√≠az de Sandoval and Lope Fern√°ndez de Villagrand, vassals of Joan N√∫√±ez and Ruy S√°nchez de Rojas, vassal of the Master of Santiago. =First winter: November 1342 ‚Äì April 1343= bola√±os, stone balls used during the 1342 siege, now in the archaeological park of the sea walls The situation deteriorated gradually in both the city and the besieging camp. Food was scarce in the Christian camp after the flooding and the crowd of troops and animals in unsanitary conditions caused the spread of diseases. In November, Peter IV of Aragon sent ten galleys commanded by Mateu Mercer to meet his treaty obligation. The Portuguese king Afonso IV sent another ten galleys under Admiral Carlos Pessanha, but they stayed for only three weeks, and their departure boosted the morale of the defenders. The Castilian forces continued to have difficulty maintaining an adequate fleet for supply and offense. However, Algeciras grew short of food due to the sea blockade. During the first months of siege the Spaniards continued to launch rocks at the walls of the city, while the defenders tried to cause losses in direct combat or with weapons such as ballistae, which could shoot large projectiles. In December 1342, troops sent by the councils of Castile and Extremadura reached the Christian camp, and with them the siege became tighter. They began to place a large number of Genoese ballistic engines around the city, while the defenders continued to shoot arrows at those installing the machines. During January 1343 the continuing struggles in the lines round the city weakened both sides. A large fortified bastida, a wooden tower commanded by I√±igo L√≥pez de Orozco, was built facing the Puerta del Fonsario, and from this tower missiles could be shot over the city wall. The first bastida was soon burned by a force that sallied from the city, but another was built and continued shooting against the city throughout the siege. Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada, was preparing to send supplies and relief to the city. With the threat of troops from Granada, the attacks escalated against the Puerta del Fonsario in the Villa Vieja, the weakest point but also the best defended. In front of it Alfonso XI ordered construction of new covered trenches, which allowed approach to the city walls to place siege engines. From Algeciras, meanwhile, the defenders fired iron projectiles from primitive gunpowder bombards, which caused extensive damage. These are said to have been the first pieces of artillery with gunpowder to be used in the peninsula. Trenches continued to be built around the city until they surrounded the entire perimeter by March 1343. Behind the trenches were earthen banks, and on these wooden walls were erected to protect the besieging soldiers, with strong towers erected at intervals. Trebuchets in the Castilian camp hurled large numbers of stone balls, or bola√±os. The trebuchets had a maximum range of , and were vulnerable to parties of besiegers that were able to cross the trenches. So many bola√±os were launched during the siege that in 1487 King Ferdinand II of Aragon sent an expedition to the ruins of Algeciras to retrieve them so they could be used again in the siege of M√°laga. Reinforcements arrived at the Christian camp from the various councils of Castile, including the knights Juan N√∫√±ez III de Lara and Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena. The fresh troops replaced the soldiers who had been injured or were weakened by hunger. Starting in February 1343, the besiegers began to extend the encircling line to block the sea approaches to the city and thus prevent the arrival of food from Gibraltar. The aim was to block the sea approach to Algeciras with logs connected by chains. The boom eventually extended from the Rodeo point to the south of the city to the Isla Verde, and from there to the Playa de Los Ladrillos to the north. However, in late March 1343 a storm broke up the boom and the logs were washed on shore, providing a useful supply of wood to the besieged. =Both sides receive reinforcements: May 1343 ‚Äì September 1343= Torre del Almirante, residence during the siege of Egidio Boccanegra In May 1343 a large army under the Sultan of Granada passed the Guadiaro River and approached the city. Alfonso XI sent for his knights to see how they could deal with this new threat. He sent letters informing Granada he would lift the siege of the city if it paid him tribute. The Sultan of Granada offered a truce, but it was not enough for the Castilians. The same month saw the arrival of numerous European knights: from England came the earls of Derby and of Salisbury; from Germany came Count Bous; from France came Gaston II, Count of Foix, and his brother Roger- Bernard, Viscount of Castelbon, and King Philip III of Navarre with supplies and troops. The troops of Granada held their position, waiting for the right moment to approach the city. During the months of June and July the situation remained unchanged. More fortified siege towers and trenches were built as fighting continued around the city. The defenders used ballistae, engines that were probably similar to catapults, and the \\"thunders\\", as the new gunpowder bombards were called by the Muslims, causing major damage to the siege forces and mainly targeting the siege towers and trenches. In August 1343, while negotiations were continuing between Castile and Granada, news arrived that in Morocco King Abu al-Hasan Ali was preparing a fleet to come to the aid of the city. Faced with the imminent entry into the struggle of forces from Granada and Morocco, it became urgent for the Christians to accelerate plans for the conquest of Algeciras. Simultaneously, Alfonso de Castilla heard that the Pope would give the kingdom 20,000 florins to defray the expenses of the campaign, and the King of France through the Archbishop of Toledo, Gil √Ålvarez Carrillo de Albornoz, would supply 50,000 florins. With this money the Spaniards could pay the Genoese mercenaries, who had long been demanding their pay. The difficulties of the Christians in the siege and the urgency of battle with Granada and Morocco were known throughout the kingdom. The King of Castile had to pawn his crown and send several of his silver belongings to be melted in Seville after a fire reduced the camp's store of flour to ashes. At the same time, Aragon provided new ships to help maintain the siege: the Vice Admiral of Valencia, Jaime Escribano, arrived in mid-August with ten Aragonese galleys. These boats and another fifteen Castilian ships commanded by Admiral Egidio Boccanegra were sent to Ceuta to do as much damage as possible to the fleet of the King of Morocco, who was waiting at this port for the arrival of the fleet from Granada to go to Algeciras' aid. In the first encounter, the Christians tried to surprise the Muslim fleet by sending into combat only the fifteen Castilian ships, while the Aragonese ships maneuvered as if preparing to go to the aid of the Moroccans. The strategy would have been expensive to the Moroccans had they not captured a Castilian sailor before the final encounter, who warned them of the ruse. The ships from Ceuta quickly returned to port and the Christian fleet had to return to the Bay of Algeciras. On his return at the siege, Egidio Boccanegra sent twenty of his ships to wait at Getares, ready to intercept the Moors if they decided to attack the encirclement. =Moroccan troops cross the strait: October 1343 ‚Äì November 1343= Access bridge to the Fonsario gate In October 1343 the Moroccan fleet crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and reached Getares. As soon as the first warning fires of the Christian beacons were seen, forty Castilian and Aragonese ships stationed themselves at the southern entrance of the city, but the boats from North Africa did not head to Algeciras, instead taking shelter in the nearby port of Gibraltar. A battle between the galleys threatened to break out. Warned of this, the Genoese squadron began to embark all that belonged to them in order to leave. With all their equipment in their ships, the Admiral Egidio Boccanegra informed the king that if they were not paid four months of arrears for service they would leave the siege. It was already known that the Genoese sailors had been dealing with the Marinids of Gibraltar and Ceuta, and the relations between them were far from hostile. It was feared in the headquarters that, not having been paid, the soldiers of Genoa would help the Muslims in the coming battle, as had happened during the time of Alfonso X. The king resolved to pay the soldiers of Genoa from his own resources, and the soldiers decided to continue the siege and remain loyal to the king. An important factor was the loans that Genoese merchants made to the King of Castile during the siege, which allowed him to quell the complaints of his soldiers. The two squadrons did not meet in the bay, but the ships commanded by the Sultan of Morocco docked in the city of Gibraltar, where they left a large number of soldiers: forty thousand infantry and twelve thousand horsemen according to some chroniclers. In November the Sultan of Granada and the Prince of Morocco advanced to the bank of the R√≠o Palmones. The movement of troops from Gibraltar to the Palmones were protected by a squadron of ships of the Emir of Morocco, which stood in the middle of the bay to prevent the Castilian-Aragonese fleet from landing troops to oppose them. The Castilian command then ordered attempts to set fire to the enemy ships by means of vessels full of flammable material and burning arrows, taking advantage of the strong east wind that was blowing. The Muslims avoided the fire by placing wet sails on deck and using long poles to fend off the enemy ships. The Castillian command had been warned of the arrival of the troops by signals to the Tower of Champions. The Islamic army sent a first expeditionary force across the river to reconnoiter the Castilians, which was observed from the tower. Alfonso XI ordered that none of his men attack the Granadans until all their troops had crossed the river. The Muslims also knew the terrain and after an initial inspection and a minor brush with a small group of Christians, returned to their side of the river waiting for news. At the Granada camp they were in no hurry to start fighting because in a few days they would receive reinforcements from their capital, and could then face the Castilians. =Battle of the River Palmones: December 1343= R√≠o Palmones marshes On 12 December 1343 the raids against the walls of the city were especially strong. The city was using \\"thunder\\" to bombard the Christian camp from cannons, while in return the Christians launched many arrows against the defenders. Shortly after dawn the Christian siege weapons made a break in the defenses, and through it an attack was launched on the city, but the besiegers were not able to penetrate. At this point the defenders of Algeciras in panic made smoke signals from the tower of the main mosque of the city indicating that the situation was untenable. At the camp of Granada they saw the signals, heard the noise, and understood that the city was being attacked. The Moorish troops from Gibraltar were quickly mobilized to join those who were in combat formation beside the R√≠o Palmones. From the Tower of the Champions, Alfonso XI directed his army to form. Don Joan N√∫√±ez was placed at the place where the river could be crossed near the mountains. Muslim troops that passed the ford had to battle the Spaniards, and were overwhelmed by the large numbers of troops that had come from the tower. Under the command of the King, all the Christian troops crossed the river and pursued the Moorish forces in their retreat. The Muslim cavalry were soon badly depleted. The Moors fled in disorder, ignoring orders to withdraw to Gibraltar. Many fled to the mountains of Algeciras, others towards the Almoraima tower, pursued by the Castilians. The allied forces of Granada and Morocco had been defeated, but R√≠o Palmones marshes contained many corpses from both sides. It was not a total defeat and there was a possibility that the Muslims would reorganize their troops. The Christians needed the city to fall soon. =Blockade and capitulation: January 1344 ‚Äì March 1344= Alfonso XI of Castile After the disastrous battle of the river Palmones, the sultan of Granada wanted to prepare a second attack on the Christian hosts, but the morale of the troops was low. The emissary of the Moroccan Sultan convinced him to try to resolve the conflict with the King of Castile by a peace treaty, and a letter was sent to the Christians at Algeciras offering a truce, but Alfonso XI did not want peace on any terms other than that the city became part of his kingdom. In January 1344 Alfonso decided to restore the naval boom, since the blockade was often violated by small boats from Gibraltar. The new barrier was formed by strong ropes supported by floating barrels, maintained in position by ship masts weighted at one end with millstones and with the other end protruding several meters from the sea surface. Installation of the barrier took two months, during which there was continued violation by small boats. In January the Muslims sent a ship loaded with provisions, but it was captured before it could reach the city. Another attempt in February was successful. On 24 February five boats reached Algeciras with provisions. The passage of boats into the city of Algeciras was definitely cut off in early March. It was now only a matter of time before hunger forced the city to capitulate or to offer a satisfactory agreement to the besiegers. By March, the situation in the city was desperate. There was no bread or any other food for its people, and only enough defenders to cover part of the wall. On Sunday 2 March Haz√°n Algarrafe, sent by the King of Granada, arrived with news for the King of Castile: the King of Granada was prepared to surrender the city. His conditions were simple: all who remained in the city should be allowed to leave under the protection of Alfonso XI with all their belongings; there would be a fifteen-year truce between Castile and the Moorish kingdoms; Granada would pay an annual tribute of twelve thousand doubloons of gold to Castile. The king's knights recommended continuing the siege, since reinforcements would soon arrive from Seville and Toledo, and the trenches around the city ensured that it would soon be starving. However, Alfonso XI did not want to continue fighting since the cost was so high in both money and lives. He accepted the proposed conditions apart from the duration of the truce, which would be for only ten years. The Treaty of Algeciras was then signed, ending twenty one months of siege. On 26 March 1344 the inhabitants of Villa Nueva passed, with their belongings, to the Villa Vieja, yielding the Villa Nueva to the prince Don Juan Manuel. The next day, the eve of Palm Sunday, the Villa Vieja was handed over to King Alfonso XI empty of its occupants. The towers of the city were decked with the banners of the king, the prince Don Pedro, Don Enrique, the Master of Santiago, Don Fernando, Don Tello and Don Juan. Accompanying the delegation were the king's main commanders, including Egidio Boccanegra, who was appointed Lord of the Estado de la Palma in appreciation for his work in the encirclement. The next day a mass was held in the mosque of the city, consecrated as a cathedral dedicated to Santa Maria de La Palma, still the patron saint of the city. An Arab historian recorded that Alfonso gave good treatment to the Moorish generals and the inhabitants who were expelled from the city. Many of them moved across the bay to Gibraltar, swelling the population of that remaining stronghold of the Sultan of Morocco. Castilian nobles who had died in the siege included Rui L√≥pez de Rivera, former Castilian ambassador in Morocco, Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga y Haro, lord of La Rioja, Gonzalo Y√°√±ez de Aguilar and Fern√°n Gonz√°lez de Aguilar, lords of Aguilar, among others. Aftermath Ruins of Algeciras in an eighteenth-century engraving. The fall of Algeciras was a decisive step in the Reconquista, giving the Crown of Castile the main port on the north coast of the Strait of Gibraltar. To ensure the prosperity of the new Castilian city, in 1345 King Alfonso XI issued a charter that provided farmland and tax benefits to anyone who wanted to settle in the city. He added \\"King of Algeciras\\" to his titles, and asked Pope Clement VI to move the Cathedral of C√°diz to Algeciras, creating the diocese of Cadiz and Algeciras and converting the main mosque of the city into a cathedral dedicated to the Virgen de la Palma. The city would thereafter be the primary basis of action of the Christian armies. After the loss of Al-Jazeera Al- Khadra, the only remaining Iberian port of Morocco was Gibraltar. All the efforts of the reconquest would now focus on taking this port. In 1349 Alfonso XI began the Fifth Siege of Gibraltar, again relying on the fleets of Aragon and Genoa, which established their main base in Algeciras, but this time the fate of the city did not depend on military actions: on 26 March of that year the king died during an epidemic of bubonic plague in the Castilian camp. This unexpected death resulted in a civil war among claimants to the throne of Castile. The consequences of the war on Algeciras were swift. In 1369, during the war between Peter the Cruel and his brother Henry II, the garrison was reduced and some of the troops sent north. Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada, took the opportunity to recapture Al-Jazeera Al-Khadra. The Muslims rebuilt the defenses and established a large force to defend the city. The fate of the city changed again with the end of the disputes in Castile. In 1379, when the Christian armies regrouped, the Moors foresaw their inability to defend the city in case of another siege, and the danger if it again fell into Castilian hands. That year they undertook the destruction of the city. They threw down the harbor walls and burned all buildings. In three days Algeciras was completely destroyed. It would remain so until the British conquest of Gibraltar in 1704, when some of the exiles from Gibraltar settled the barren fields of the former Villa Vieja.

Lockitron is made by Apigy, a start-up based in Mountain View, California. Apigy was a graduate of the Y Combinator start-up accelerator. Multiple models of Lockitron have been manufactured, including one that fits over the lock control mechanism on the inside of a door, and the door can then be unlocked via an app on the phone, or via web page control. Phones with Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0) can also automatically unlock a door when an authenticated device is nearby. A supplied NFC tag can be read to trigger a command to toggle the state of the lock. Virtual \\"keys\\" can also be created for guests or repair contractors etc., which allows access to the home. The virtual keys can be distributed over the internet on demand, and can also be revoked on demand. The door can also be locked or unlocked via an SMS \\"key\\" for those without smartphones. All models of Lockitron allow for a traditional lock which continues to work with traditional metal keys. When a metal key is used, some models of Lockitron can send a notification to a smartphone. Lockitron exposes an open, web-accessible API. Lockitron supports integration with the Ring Video Doorbell, a doorbell system that sends video and voice from the door to a smartphone. Other devices that have integrated with the Lockitron API include the Pebble Smartwatch, which allows you to directly lock and unlock a Lockitron from your wrist, and IFTTT, which connects Lockitron to platforms and devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Nest. For a period of time Apigy developed Lockitron in an office that previously housed the Byte Shop where the first Apple I computers were sold. Apigy hosted an open house at the location where several working Apple II computers were set up for attendees to play classic games like TRON and Pacman. The Chamberlain Group announced in early 2019 that they had acquired Lockitron in order to integrate door locks into their myQ platform. Crowdfunded Lockitron Apigy originally offered a full replacement door lock version of Lockitron in 2011 before announcing a version of Lockitron in 2012 which fit over preexisting deadbolt locks. The 2012 version of Lockitron incorporated a number of improvements over the 2011 Lockitron deadbolt including built-in WiFi, replacing a wired basestation, built-in auto-unlock technology through Bluetooth Low Energy, and a simplified installation by making Lockitron a device that fits over a preexisting deadbolt lock. The crowdfunded Lockitron was built around an ATMega microprocessor meaning that it is Arduino compatible for other custom behavior. The crowdfunded Lockitron was rejected from Kickstarter, after the crowdfunding changed their policies regarding hardware funding. The creators claim the rejection was due to Lockitron's status as a \\"home improvement\\" product, but this has not been confirmed by Kickstarter. After their rejection, the founders of Apigy, Cameron Robertson and Paul Gerhardt, built their own crowdfunding website in a matter of days and used it to garner over 1.5 million USD in preorders during the first week of their campaign in October 2012. Apigy subsequently open- sourced their crowdfunding software as Selfstarter, an alternative crowdfunding site. Selfstarter was used in the successful Tile crowdfunding campaign and later formed the basis of Crowdhoster and CrowdTilt Open. The crowdfunded Lockitron was significantly delayed from its originally anticipated ship date of July 2013, shipping in small numbers through the end of 2013. By February 2014, the crowdfunded Lockitron had still not yet shipped in substantial numbers prompting coverage by the blog TechCrunch. By the end of 2014 thousands of units had been shipped. In early 2015, Apigy announced its new product, Lockitron Bolt, as a replacement for the crowdfunded Lockitron and that it had ceased production of the crowdfunded Lockitron due to manufacturing and product issues. Lockitron Bolt Lockitron Bolt is priced at 99 USD and offers Bluetooth only connectivity in comparison to its predecessor which was priced at 179 USD and offered built-in WiFi; an optional 79 USD device called Bridge connects Lockitron Bolt to WiFi networks giving it the same remote capabilities as the 2012 Lockitron. In late 2015 Apigy announced that the first Lockitron Bolt devices would ship 24 November 2015 while also announcing an add-on to Lockitron Bolt, Keypad. A series of updates in late 2016 indicated that remaining Lockitron Bolt units owed to backers were produced and all remaining orders for U.S. customers had shipped to customers.

Olusola is best known as the beatboxer of the a capella band Pentatonix. After the group won NBC's The Sing-Off in 2011, they released five albums, which all charted in the top 5 of the Billboard 200 charts, have sold over 2 million records, and have amassed more than two billion views on their YouTube channel. Olusola has also been identified as developing the art of \\"celloboxing\\" (playing cello and beatboxing simultaneously). His celloboxing version of Mark Summer's \\"Julie-O\\" went viral in April 2011, which led him to become involved with Pentatonix. Olusola has performed at classical musical festivals such as the Amsterdam Cello Biennale and the Kronberg Academy Festival, opened the TED Conference in Vancouver, and was chosen by Quincy Jones to represent him in concert at the 2012 Montreux Jazz Festival on the same program as Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea. Olusola is fluent in Mandarin. Early life and education Olusola was born in Owensboro, Kentucky, to Nigerian-born Oluwole Olusola, a psychiatrist, and Grenadian-born Curline Paul, a nurse. At that time, his father had just come from medical school in Nigeria and an internship in Trinidad and Tobago to Loma Linda University, where he met his wife while she was doing her MPH. After they married, they moved to Hershey, Pennsylvania (where Kevin's sister Candace was born) for a short period of time, and then to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for his father to finish residency at Albert Einstein Medical Center (where Kevin's brother Kellon was born). Olusola started his education at Greater Philadelphia Junior Academy, but his family eventually moved to Owensboro, Kentucky, where he was raised. He attended the Triplett School, a Montessori-based school, for a short period of time before his parents transferred him to the Owensboro Public School system for their accelerated math program that allowed him to take precalculus starting in the 9th grade. He decided to enroll at Phillips Academy Andover for 11th grade (upper year). Olusola says that Andover taught him work ethic, tenacity, and discipline. He went from an average student to a high honors student in his senior year. He was involved in community service (directing a music program for elementary string students) and Spanish-speaking activities, where he led the Spanish language table and went to Costa Rica for four weeks to study Spanish. After graduating from Andover, Olusola chose to attend Yale University. At Yale, Olusola planned to pursue medicine and finished all his pre-med requirements. He started as an academic music major, but decided to switch to East Asian Studies after being introduced to China through a 10-day Chinese government sponsored trip for 100 Yale students. He lived in Beijing for 6 months through a PKU-Yale joint program during his sophomore year, and then took a leave of absence during the 2009‚Äì2010 academic school year on Yale's Light Fellowship to study intensive Chinese at the Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Study in Beijing. In school, Olusola was the Director of Communications for a Rhodes Scholar-led non-profit called College Outreach, and he worked as a book monitor in the Yale Law School library and as a practice room monitor at the Yale School of Music. He graduated from Yale in 2011. Musical career=1988‚Äì2010: Career beginnings= Olusola's parents discovered his musical talent when he was six months old and decided to put him in music lessons. He started the piano at age 4, the cello at age 6, and alto saxophone at age 10. He was heavily involved in music programs throughout grade school at Owensboro, Kentucky, in school and the community participating in jazz band, marching band, concert band, orchestra, and community youth orchestra. When Olusola was 12 years old, he was selected as the principal saxophonist of the United States Collegiate Wind Band and toured Europe during the summer for three weeks. He was also the principal cellist of the Kentucky State Youth Orchestra and received the highest honor at the Kentucky Governor's School for the Arts. He soloed and performed in a piano trio at Carnegie Hall as the winner of the American Fine Arts Festival, and soloed a second time on alto saxophone for PBS‚Äôs special \\"From the Top at Carnegie Hall\\". While at Yale, Olusola was one of the principal cellists of the Yale Symphony Orchestra and participated in chamber music. It was during his junior year when he started thinking about music as a career when, that previous summer in Beijing, he began working on \\"celloboxing\\". One of his teachers at a Harvard summer intensive Chinese program suggested that he should try combining the two abilities. He won runner-up in Yo-Yo Ma‚Äôs \\"Celebrate and Collaborate With Yo-Yo Ma\\" competition (Ma said Olusola's version of Dona Nobis Pacem was \\"inventive and unexpected\\") and opened for KRS-One at Southern Connecticut State University. Olusola says that, during that spring break, his pre-med mentor C. Brandon Ogbunu (who was an MD/PhD student at Yale at the time) helped him to make the decision to finally go into music, saying medicine would always be there. After a summer of neurobiology research at Yale, Olusola moved to Beijing for his academic year of Chinese study and continuously honed his celloboxing skills. He started uploading celloboxing covers to his YouTube channel and performed for Ambassador Jon Huntsman, Jr. at his residence, and on Beijing Television with Li Yu Gang and Chong‚Äôer (Chinese beatboxer). He also met KorElement, an American rapper in Beijing, and they did covers on YouTube, in addition to performing together at the American Pavilion for the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. =2010‚Äìpresent: Pentatonix= After Olusola's academic stint in China, he spent the summer in Beijing working on his celloboxing version of Mark Summer's \\"Julie-O\\" the summer of 2010 while living in a Chinese friend's apartment as a way to begin expanding his skills. He continued working on it throughout the year and decided to audition to music schools with it. He ultimately decided to enroll in the Berklee College of Music. During his spring semester of senior year, Olusola (along with YouTube sensation Sam Tsui) was nominated for a graduation-day prize and videotaped \\"Julie-O\\" with the help of YouTube star and Yale alum Jake Bruene. Olusola posted the video on April 14, 2011, and by the second week, the video had reached number 6 on Reddit, and had become a viral video on the Internet, garnering national and international acclaim. At the time the video was going viral, Olusola was contacted by Scott Hoying who was impressed by his musicality and beatboxing skills. Hoying was forming a group with Kirstie Maldonado, Mitch Grassi, and Avi Kaplan to compete in season three of NBC‚Äôs The Sing-Off and he wanted Olusola to join. The second weekend after Olusola graduated from college, he met the group the day before the audition, and Pentatonix was born. After the taping of the show, Olusola did a brief stint as the cellist for Gungor on the David Crowder Band \\"7\\" Tour before returning with Pentatonix for the season finale. The group won the Sing-Off title on Nov. 28th, 2011, which landed them a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment and a $200K cash prize. The band immediately moved to Los Angeles to record their first album with producer Ben Bram, whom they met on the show. Their first EP, PTX, Volume 1, was released on June 26, 2012, charting at #14 in the US Billboard 200 chart and #5 on the digital chart. It sold 20,000 copies in its first week of release. They embarked on a fall 2012 tour and released their Christmas EP, PTXmas, on November 13, 2012. After their winter‚Äìspring 2013 tour, Pentatonix returned to the studio to finish their second EP, PTX, Vol. II. Olusola became more interested in songwriting and production, especially with how stomping and clapping could be used as an effective production tool for bolstering their a cappella tracks. Olusola co- wrote four of the songs on the album, Natural Disaster, Love Again, Hey Momma/Hit the Road Jack and Run to You. The album was released on November 5, 2013 and debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Independent charts, selling 31,000 copies in the first week. The Christmas album was re-released on November 19, 2015, additionally labeled the \\"Deluxe Edition\\", and contained two additional tracks. One of these, The Little Drummer Boy, charted in several Billboard categories including peaking at number two on the \\"Streaming Songs\\" chart and number one on the \\"Holiday 100\\" chart. It became the fourth-highest charting holiday song on the Hot 100 in Billboard history. Pentatonix signed a deal with RCA Records after finishing their third US tour and their second European tour in 2014, and have finished and released their self-titled album. Olusola also released a solo EP in early 2015, titled The Renegade EP. It charted #1 on Billboard Classical Albums Chart and Apple iTunes Classical Chart. On February 8, 2015, Pentatonix won a Grammy in the \\"Best Arrangement, Instrumental or a cappella\\" category for their song \\"Daft Punk\\", a medley of songs by Daft Punk. On February 15, 2016, Pentatonix won a Grammy in the same category, this time for ‚ÄúDance of the Sugar Plum Fairy‚Äù from their ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Christmas to Me‚Äù album. On February 12, 2017, Pentatonix won a Grammy in the \\"Best Country duo/group performance\\" category for \\"Jolene\\" which featured Dolly Parton. Personal life Olusola met college admissions consultant Leigh Weissman in 2017 and they were married in Simi Valley, California in September 2019 with both a traditional Nigerian and an American-style ceremony. Olusola is a Christian.

Together with Pentatonix, Maldonado has released seven studio albums, won three Grammy Awards, and sold over six million albums. Maldonado debuted her solo career on May 19, 2017, with the song \\"Break a Little\\" under the moniker Kirstin (stylized as kƒ±rstƒ±n‚Ñ¢; the ‚Ñ¢ stands for \\"Taylor Maldonado,\\" not trademark), with her debut EP L O V E released on July 14, 2017. She also made her Broadway debut in 2018, portraying Lauren in Kinky Boots.  Early life and education  Kirstin Taylor Maldonado was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 16, 1992. Her mother is Spanish-Italian, while her father, Michael Cisneros, is Mexican. Maldonado was raised by her mother Angelica Maldonado in Arlington, Texas. Maldonado was only five years old when she first expressed her wish to become a singer. At eight years old, she sang at her mother's wedding reception, ultimately convincing her mother to enroll her in voice lessons. Maldonado also got into theater and starred in several local productions. It was through the local theater community that Maldonado met Mitch Grassi, a future fellow Pentatonix member. Maldonado attended Holy Rosary Catholic School, and later Martin High School. At Martin High School, she met Scott Hoying with whom she and Grassi would later form Pentatonix. The three friends created an a cappella trio and started getting attention around their school for their covers of popular songs. Maldonado graduated from Martin High School in 2010 and went to The University of Oklahoma where she was a Musical Theatre Performance major. She dropped out in order to form Pentatonix.  Pentatonix  In 2011, Maldonado was contacted by her high school friend Scott Hoying who wanted to put together a group for NBC's a cappella competition The Sing-Off. Maldonado agreed to join the group, which also included Mitch Grassi, another of her high school friends. Together they formed the a cappella group Pentatonix along with Avi Kaplan and Kevin Olusola. The group entered and eventually won the third season of The Sing- Off. Since then, they have released several albums and EPs, reached 13 million YouTube subscribers and over 2 billion YouTube views, and toured the world. As a member of Pentatonix, Maldonado has won three Grammy Awards. On February 8, 2015, Pentatonix won a Grammy in the \\"Best Arrangement, Instrumental or a cappella\\" category for their song \\"Daft Punk\\", a medley of songs by Daft Punk. On February 15, 2016, Pentatonix won a Grammy in the same category, this time for \\"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\\" from their \\"That‚Äôs Christmas to Me\\" album. On February 12, 2017, Pentatonix won a Grammy in the \\"Best Country duo/group performance\\" category for \\"Jolene\\" which featured Dolly Parton.  Other projects and appearances  Maldonado performed at the Hippodrome, London with the song \\"Never Neverland\\" together with Scott Alan in May 2014. In January 2016, Maldonado performed the song \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" at the World Dog Awards in honor of the dogs who have played the role of Toto from the iconic story about The Wizard of Oz. In February 2016, the a cappella group Voctave released the video \\"Disney Love Medley\\" which featured Maldonado and her fiance Jeremy Michael Lewis. In the video, Maldonado and Lewis perform the songs \\"I See the Light\\" from Tangled, \\"You'll Be in My Heart\\" from Tarzan and \\"Go the Distance\\" from Hercules with the members of Voctave providing the backing vocals. In May 2016, Maldonado, along with Grassi and Hoying, appeared in an episode of Bones titled \\"The Strike in the Chord\\". Maldonado played the role of Liz Dervan, a member of the college a capella group \\"The Gingersnaps\\". In February 2017, Maldonado stated during an interview she would be releasing a solo project sometime in the spring.

It was first used in modern times by Gottlieb Burckhardt in 1891, but only in a few isolated instances, not becoming more widely used until the 1930s following the work of Portuguese neurologist Ant√≥nio Egas Moniz. The 1940s was the decade when psychosurgery was most popular, largely due to the efforts of American neurologist Walter Freeman; its use has been declining since then. Freeman‚Äôs particular form of psychosurgery, the lobotomy, was last used in the 1970s, but other forms of psychosurgery, such as the cingulotomy and capsulotomy have survived. Early history Trepanning, the practice of drilling holes in the skull, was performed from prehistoric times to the early Middle Ages and then again during the Renaissance. There is speculation that some of these operations were carried out on people who had mental disorders or epilepsy. Trepanation was depicted in prints, woodblocks, and paintings, including the allegorical painting by Hieronymus Bosch, The Extraction of the Stone of Madness, which depicts the extraction of a \\"brain stone\\". In 1891 Gottlieb Burckhardt, the superintendent of a psychiatric hospital in Switzerland, published the results of an operation on the brains of six patients. The operation was a topectomy, in which parts of the frontal, parietal and temporal cortex were excised. Other psychiatrists were not enthusiastic about his work and he abandoned his operations. The Estonian neurosurgeon Ludvig Puusepp also operated on psychiatric patients in St Petersburg in 1910. 1930s It was the work of the Portuguese neurologist Ant√≥nio Egas Moniz in the 1930s that led to a wider use of psychosurgery. Moniz, working with neurosurgeon Pedro Almeida Lima, started operating on patients in late 1935. The first operations involved injections of alcohol into the frontal lobes of patients to destroy white matter; Moniz then devised an instrument he called a leucotome to remove small cores of white matter. He coined the terms leucotomy and psychosurgery. Moniz's methods were taken up in the United States by the neurological team headed by Walter Freeman and the neurosurgeon James Watts, who, in the words of American psychiatrist Victor Swayze, \\"did more to promote the use of psychosurgery than anyone else in the world\\". At first they used the same technique as Moniz, but then they devised their own technique which more completely severed the connections between the frontal lobes and deeper structures. They coined the term lobotomy for the operation, and it became known as the standard prefrontal lobotomy or leucotomy of Freeman and Watts.Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, retained the word leucotomy rather than lobotomy Freeman and Watts eventually performed 600 of these standard operations; in the United Kingdom neurosurgeon Wylie McKissock performed over 1,400. The two foremost promoters of psychosurgery in the 1930s, Moniz in Portugal and Freeman in the US, were both neurologists. Psychiatrists were later found amongst both the supporters and critics of psychosurgery. Jos√© de Matos Sobral Cid, who had initially allowed Moniz to operate on patients from his asylum, became a critic of the procedure.ES Valenstein 1986 Great and desperate cures : the rise and decline of psychosurgery and other radical treatments for mental illness. New York : Basic Books Freeman was at first not allowed to operate on patients at the hospital where he was director of laboratories, St. Elizabeth's, Washington, as the superintendent William Alanson White was opposed to the operation. White's successor, Winfred Overholser, cautiously allowed Freeman to operate at the hospital.M Raz 2013 The lobotomy letters: the making of American psychosurgery. University of Rochester Press: 46-48. British psychiatrist William Sargant, on a visit to Washington in 1939, met Freeman and was sufficiently impressed with the results of his operation on three patients to introduce it into the United Kingdom and to remain a lifelong advocate of psychosurgery.W Sargant 1967 The unquiet mind: the autobiography of a physician in psychological medicine. London: Heinemann Until Freeman introduced the technique of transorbital lobotomy, psychosurgery required the skills of a surgeon. The standard lobotomy/leucotomy involved drilling burr holes in the skull on the side of the head and inserting a cutting instrument; it was thus a \\"closed\\" operation, with the surgeon unable to see exactly what he was cutting. In 1937 J.G. Lyerly at the Florida State Hospital developed a similar operation but reached the brain via larger holes in the forehead and was thus able to see what he was cutting. Some neurosurgeons preferred this \\"open\\" technique to Freeman and Watts' closed technique as it was less likely to damage blood vessels; it became the most widely used standard lobotomy/leucotomy in the United States. 1940s The use of psychosurgery increased during the 1940s, and there was a proliferation of the techniques used for the operation. In 1946 Freeman developed the transorbital lobotomy, based on a technique first reported by Italian psychiatrist Amarro Fiamberti. In this operation an ice-pick like instrument was inserted through the roof of the orbit (eye socket), driven in with a mallet, and swung to and fro to cut through the white matter. Freeman used electroconvulsive therapy in the place of a normal anaesthetic and carried out the operation without the aid of a neurosurgeon. This led to a rift with Watts. Freeman performed over 4,000 of these transorbital operations. During the 1940s neurosurgeons devised other methods of psychosurgery in the hope of avoiding the undesirable effects of the standard operation that were becoming increasingly apparent as long-term follow-up studies were conducted. William Beecher Scoville, of Hartford Hospital and Yale Medical School, developed a method of cortical undercutting. Two of the techniques still in use today date from this period: Jean Talaraich in France developed the capsulotomy, while at Oxford in England Hugh Cairns performed the first cingulotomies in the late 1940s.GJ Fraenkel 1991 Hugh Cairns: first Nuffield Professor of Surgery, University of Oxford. Oxford University Press: 207-08 The 1940s also saw the introduction of the stereotactic frame, which would allow surgeons to find their bearings more accurately when doing closed operations. Many countries started to use psychosurgery during this decade. In 1939 Freeman had given a talk at the International Congress in Neurology in Copenhagen and, although initially met with scepticism by Scandinavian psychiatrists, they were soon using psychosurgery on patients, especially those diagnosed as schizophrenic. In Sweden and Denmark operations were performed in neurosurgical wards; in Norway they were more often carried out by visiting orthopaedic surgeons in psychiatric hospitals. Norway was also the only Scandinavian country to use transorbital lobotomy. In Britain, the first psychosurgical operations were carried out in Bristol in late 1940 and early 1941. By 1947 the Board of Control was able to publish a report entitled Pre-frontal leucotomy in 1,000 cases. Psychosurgery was also introduced into British East Africa. In 1946 twenty prefrontal leucotomies were performed, mostly on African women, in Bulawayo. The next year a further 70 were performed, but the number declined after that.J McCulloch 1995 Colonial psychiatry and \\"the African mind\\". Cambridge University Press: 19 In 1949 Moniz shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine because of his \\"discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses\\". He had already been nominated three times for his work on radiology. A further nomination in 1943, this time by Walter Freeman for psychosurgery, had led to an evaluation of the operation by Erik Essen-M√∂ller, a professor of psychiatry. His report to the Nobel Committee pointed out that Moniz had paid too little attention to the side-effects of psychosurgery and had not done any in-depth observations. Essen-M√∂ller also studied the published literature on psychosurgery; he found a mortality rate of about 3.5 per cent, with other patients left in the state of \\"a surgically induced childhood\\". He also noted the lack of comparison with other treatments and concluded that it was a mutilating treatment with a \\"negative side yet to be heard\\", and did not deserve the prize.C-M Stolt 2002 Moniz, lobotomy, and the 1949 Nobel Prize. In E Crawford (ed.) Historical studies in the Nobel Archives: the prizes in science and medicine. Universal Academy Press, Tokyo: 79-93 Moniz received nine nominations in 1949 (five from Lisbon, three from Brazil and one from Copenhagen) and this led to a special report by the neurosurgeon Herbert Olivecrona, who deemed that Moniz's hypothesis \\"that emotional tension could be eliminated by leucotomy\\" had been proven. He opined that the personality changes following surgery were of subordinate importance and that the death rate, which he put at one or two per cent by then, was \\"not worth mentioning\\". Accordingly, Moniz was awarded the prize. 1950s and 1960s In spite of the award of the Nobel Prize to Moniz, the popularity of psychosurgery decreased during the 1950s. This has been attributed to \\"an increased awareness of the negative changes of personality in addition to the introduction of new anti-psychotic medication\\". In the United States the use of psychosurgery probably peaked at an estimated 5,000 or so operations annually. In Britain in the mid-1950s, about three-quarters of psychosurgical operations were standard pre-frontal leucotomies. By the end of the decade, some 500 operations were carried out every year. The standard operation was on its way out, but still accounted for about one-fifth of operations. From 1940 to 1960, Scandinavia used psychosurgery at a rate of about two-and-a-half times the rate of the United States. Gaustad in Norway became a particular centre for psychosurgery in the mid-1950s, with money from the United States. In the United States in the 1960s up until the early 70s, Harvard Medical School, Neurosurgeon Vernon H. Mark at Boston City Hospital, and his associate, Professor of Psychiatry Dr Frank R. Ervin, carried out research on electroencephalographic recordings on the skull (EEG), cerebral surface, as well as deep structures of the brain. They studied patients with EEG abnormalities and overt seizure disorders associated with uncontrolled aggression and found that many of these patients had abnormalities of the brain causing their temporal lobe epilepsy or psychomotor seizures. Their treatment was stimulation or ablation of the amygdala, unilaterally or bilaterally. Approximately 20 amygdalotomies were performed, with many patients improved but not necessarily cured. This work in psychosurgery became highly controversial and as the debate on psychosurgery heated up in the 70s it was abandoned. Innovations in surgical techniques continued apace. In Britain in 1964 Geoffrey Knight developed the subcaudate tractotomy, implanting radioactive seeds in the brain to destroy tissue. This was to become the most widely used type of psychosurgery in Britain, until it was abandoned some thirty years later. In Tulane in the United States, Robert Heath and colleagues in the 1950s began experimenting with deep brain stimulation as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. The Tulane programme would continue until the 1970s. 1970s to the 1980s The 1970s was a decade of ethical debate about psychosurgery. In the United States this debate followed the publication of a book entitled Violence and the Brain, in which the authors advocated psychosurgery as a way to prevent violence, and then a landmark legal case (Kaimowitz v the Department of Mental Health) which concerned a prisoner's ability to consent to psychosurgery. As a result, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research held hearings on psychosurgery. Its report was favourable and concluded that research on psychosurgery should continue. In the United Kingdom, a survey found that in the mid-1970s about 150 people a year were undergoing psychosurgery. A few people underwent the standard pre-frontal leucotomy; the most commonly used operation was subcaudate tractotomy. Methods used to destroy tissue included thermocoagulation, suction, radioisotopes and leucotomes. By far the most common diagnosis of those undergoing psychosurgery was depression, followed by anxiety, violence, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.JM Barraclough and NA Mitchell-Heggs 1978 Use of neurosurgery for psychological disorder in British Isles during 1974-6. British Medical Journal, 9 December 1978: 1591-3 The 1983 Mental Health Act legislated for the use of psychosurgery. Section 57 stipulated that it could only be used on patients who had consented to it, and when a psychiatrist from the Mental Health Act Commission had authorised it and the psychiatrist and two non-medical people from the Commission considered that the consent was valid.The Mental Health Act Commission. 1999 Eight Biennial Report: 182 By the end of the 1980s about 20 patients a year were undergoing psychosurgery in the United Kingdom.Royal College of Psychiatrists 2000 Neurosurgery for mental disorder. London 1990s to the present There are four different psychosurgical techniques that have been in common use in recent years: anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, limbic leucotomy and anterior capsulotomy. In the United Kingdom, psychosurgery continued during the 1990s at the rate of fewer than 30 operations a year. In 1999 there were eight operations - one in London, three in Cardiff and three in Dundee, all for depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In Australia and New Zealand there were two operations a year in the 1990s, down from ten to twenty in the early 1980s. The use of psychosurgery in the United States is difficult to estimate but continues at one centre at least in Massachusetts. Other countries where it continues to be used include Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Spain, and some South American and Eastern European countries. Psychosurgery had been prohibited by the Minister of Health in the USSR. In the late 1990s the Institute of the Human Brain in St Petersburg developed a programme of cingulotomy for the treatment of addiction. Deep brain stimulation is now being used as an alternative to ablative psychosurgery. There is debate about whether or not, for legislative purposes, it should be considered as psychosurgery. Effects The purpose of psychosurgery is to reduce the symptoms of mental disorder, and it was recognised that with standard pre- frontal leucotomies this was accomplished at the expense of a person's personality and intellect. British psychiatrist Maurice Partridge, who conducted a follow-up study of 300 patients who had undergone pre-frontal leucotomy, said that the treatment achieved its effects by \\"reducing the complexity of psychic life\\". The operation left people with a restricted intellectual range; spontaneity, responsiveness, self-awareness and self- control were reduced, and activity was replaced by inertia.M Partridge 1950 Pre-frontal leucotomy. Blackwell Scientific Publications: 470-471. The degree to which people were damaged by these early operations varied greatly. A few people managed to return to responsible work, while at the other extreme people were left with severe and disabling impairments. Most people fell into an intermediate group, left with some improvement of their symptoms but also with emotional and intellectual deficits to which they had to adjust, for better or worse. On average, there was a mortality of rate of approximately 5 per cent during the 1940s.EA Valenstein 1997 History of Psychosurgery. In S Greenblatt et al., (eds.) A History of Neurosurgery. The American Association of Neurological Surgeons: 499‚Äì516. Freeman coined the term \\"surgically induced childhood\\" and used it constantly to refer the results of lobotomy. The operation left people with an \\"infantile personality\\"; a period of maturation would then, according to Freeman, lead to recovery. In an unpublished memoir he described how the \\"personality of the patient was changed in some way in the hope of rendering him more amenable to the social pressures under which he is supposed to exist\\". He described one 29-year-old woman as being, following lobotomy, a \\"smiling, lazy and satisfactory patient with the personality of an oyster\\" who couldn't remember Freeman's name and endlessly poured coffee from an empty pot. When her parents had difficulty dealing with her behaviour, Freeman advised a system of rewards (ice-cream) and punishment (smacks).M Raz 2013 The lobotomy letters: the making of American psychosurgery. University of Rochester Press: 101-113. The risks of psychosurgery have been greatly reduced by modern stereotactic techniques, where more discrete lesions are made in the brain. Adverse effects of capsulotomy and cingulotomy include seizures, fatigue and personality changes. The risk of death or vascular injury is extremely small. Success rates for anterior capsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, and limbic leucotomy in treating depression and OCD have been reported as between 25 and 70 per cent. There remain concerns however about the poor quality of studies and the lack of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Ethics Psychosurgery has always been a controversial treatment, and ethical concerns about its use were raised early in its history. Psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott wrote to The Lancet in 1943 about the \\"special objection that is easily felt to the treatment of mental disorder by any method that leaves a permanent physical deficiency or deformity of the brain\\", even if favourable results could sometimes be shown to follow.C Winnicott, R Shepherd and M Davis 1989 Psycho-Analytic Explorations. Harvard University Press: 542-553. In the 1950s, Winnicott continued to explore the ethics of psychosurgery, arguing that it altered \\"the seat of the self\\", \\"put a premium on the relief of suffering\\" and created teams of neurosurgeons with vested interests that could affect evaluation of the operation. By this time, he pointed out, there were many people in the community who had been left with distressing effects of psychosurgery, even though they may have originally been suffering from illnesses that were not without hope of remission. By the late 1970s, when modified techniques with less devastating consequences had replaced lobotomies, and the number of operations carried out had dropped considerably, ethical concerns revolved around consent. A report in 1977 by the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare highlighted the fact that psychosurgery was an irreversible procedure and that the data regarding its effects were unsatisfactory. There were concerns about consent, especially when the patients were children, prisoners, or detained. There were also concerns about particular uses of psychosurgery, for example in the treatment of aggression or violence, or as a treatment for children.Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Use of psychosurgery in practise and research: report and recommendations for public comment. Federal Register, 23 May 1977, part 3. In England in 1980 lawyer Larry Gostin called for psychosurgery to be subject to \\"the strictest legal and ethical scrutiny\\". He identified a number of problems with the newer forms of psychosurgery: the lack of any reliable theoretical position relating to psychosurgery, with different forms of surgery used in similar cases, and similar surgery used for a wide range of psychiatric conditions; the absence of controlled trials; the difficulty in assessing changes in character caused by the surgery; and the irreversible nature of surgery on brain tissue that appeared to be structurally normal. In spite of these ethical concerns, he noted, there had never been in the UK any \\"guidelines, controls, regulations or monitoring arrangements relating to its use\\". Gostin argued that psychosurgery should only be given with the consent of the patient and approval of an independent body comprising a multi- disciplinary legal and lay element. His proposals were largely incorporated into the Mental Health Act 1983, and led to a significant fall in the use of psychosurgery in England and Wales. Ethical debate relating to psychosurgery in the twenty-first century still revolves around questions about benefit, risks, consent and the lack of a rationale for the operation.G Gillet 2007 Psychosurgery and neuroimplantation: changing what is deep within a person.

Sanders was a soldier from the U.S. state of Alabama who served as a commissioned officer in both the Confederate and Union armies during the U.S. Civil War. After initially joining the 31st Georgia Infantry Regiment as a private in 1861, he was elected captain of Company C in that regiment a year later, fighting for the South until he resigned his commission in January 1864 and returned to Alabama, claiming ill health. Once he had returned home, Sanders switched sides and joined the 1st Regiment of Florida Cavalry (U.S.), where he obtained a provisional commission as a Second Lieutenant in F Company of that regiment. While it was not unprecedented for soldiers of one side to enlist in the army of the other, it was virtually unheard-of for an officer of one force to be commissioned in the other, once the war had begun. Quickly establishing a reputation as a local \\"bushwacker,\\" Sanders wreaked havoc with local 'Rebel' civilians--many of whom were his own neighbors--who accused him of stealing their horses, cattle and other possessions in contradiction of the laws of war. Sent on a recruiting mission in early 1865 into the Florida interior by his superior Brigadier General Alexander Asboth, Sanders disobeyed his orders and spent four months in the Forks of the Creek Swamp near Campbellton, Florida, from which he emerged on 14 March to attack the southern Alabama town of Newton. Defeated by local militiamen, Sanders returned to Federal lines where he managed to talk his way out of a court-martial and was permitted to resign his commission, after being characterized by Asboth as \\"grossly negligent\\" and \\"incompetent.\\"Official U.S. Military Record of Joseph G. Sanders, statement by Brigadier General Asboth, indicating that Sanders was not guilty (in his opinion) of any \\"criminality,\\" but that he was guilty of \\"gross neglect and incompetency to fill a position as a commissioned officer,\\" and recommended his discharge \\"for the good of the service.\\" After killing a citizen of Newton who was part of a posse sent to arrest him, Sanders fled to DeKalb County, Georgia, where his victim's father is alleged to have hunted him down and killed him.

Accordingly, he requested and obtained a medical furlough to return to his home in Dale County, which was granted on 9 October.Official Confederate Records of Joseph G. Sanders, Medical Directors Office register.Official Confederate Records of Joseph G. Sanders, Special Orders #269-12. =Resignation from Confederate service= Upon his return to Alabama, Sanders began work on a gristmill, which was welcomed by his neighbors as their area was described a being \\"quite destitute of mills.\\" Accordingly, they drew up a petition to Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy, to ask that Sanders be allowed to resign his commission and remain at his home. Insisting that he was \\"patriotic and loyal,\\" and that \\"only his ill health and shattered constitution keeps him away from his command,\\" the signers earnestly pleaded that Davis approve Sanders' resignation from military service. Thirty-two citizens of Dale County signed the petition, including the Probate Judge, Daniel Carmichael, whose son Jesse had served as a corporal in the 15th Alabama Infantry, losing a hand at Antietam. Ironically, Jesse Carmichael would later play a pivotal role in Sanders' defeat when Sanders attacked his own hometown in March 1865--this time, while wearing the uniform of a Federal officer. Captain Sanders' resignation was forwarded to his regimental commander, Colonel Evans, who recommended its approval: Generals Jubal Early (Sanders' division commander) and Richard S. Ewell (his corps commander) concurred, and Sanders' resignation took effect on 29 January 1864.Official Confederate Records of Joseph G.

Sanders, Muster-in Roll for 1st Florida Cavalry, pg. 2. He was granted a provisional commission as a Second Lieutenant by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks on 5 July 1864, which he received on 17 July 1864 with orders to report for duty with Company F of the First Florida Cavalry (US) on 23 August, when the regiment was mustered in for Federal service in Florida. Sanders accordingly presented himself at the U.S. outpost at Barrancas, Florida, where he enrolled for a term of three years.Official U.S. Military Record of Joseph G. Sanders, Muster Roll for 1st Florida Cavalry, pg. 1. Sanders' Federal records indicate that he was commissioned \\"from civil life;\\" no mention is made anywhere in his U.S. file of his former Confederate service. Local histories insist that prior to obtaining this new commission, Sanders was facing conscription back into the Southern army; furthermore, say they, he had already become the leader of a local gang of deserters and Unionists who had begun to terrorize the citizens of lower Alabama.The Battle of Newton, by Dale Cox.--many of whom had been his own friends and neighbors. \\"He was known to be a brave man,\\" wrote Jesse Carmichael; \\"and as a result, his incursions into the county, and they were frequent, were very much dreaded.\\" =Raid on Newton= Sanders' service with the 1st Florida Cavalry seems to have gone reasonably well until 25 February 1865, when he was ordered to take twenty men and proceed to the East Pass at Santa Rosa Island, where he was to recruit new soldiers for his regiment, as well as 'confiscate' cattle and horses belonging to 'Rebel' civilians in nearby Walton and Holmes counties.Official U.S. Military Records of Joseph G.

Sanders, Special Orders 149, Dated 16 June 1865, regarding absence of 2LT Joseph Sanders, amended by statement made 24 July 1865 by Adjutant General Theodore Markle. Sanders had performed this duty the previous September, soon after joining his regiment.Official U.S. Military Record of Joseph G. Sanders, statement of Joseph G. Sanders relative to his initial muster. But instead of obeying this directive, Sanders and his men made their way into the Forks of the Creek Swamp near Campbellton, where they hid out and waited for an opportunity to attack the small town of Newton, which was then the county seat of Dale County. Sanders knew that the courthouse there contained records of his former Confederate service (and those of other men in his unit), and he apparently wished to destroy them. He and his men accordingly set out for Newton on the evening of 14 March 1865, but their movement was detected, and the citizens of the town were given advance warning. Jesse Carmichael, the one-handed veteran whose father had attested the petition sent to Jefferson Davis on Sanders' behalf the previous Autumn, quickly organized the local Home Guard to oppose his one-time neighbor. Though Captain Joseph Breare--the Home Guard commander--attempted to take charge of the town's defense, Carmichael defied his orders to gather on the west side of the courthouse square, and instead posted himself and nine friends east of the square, where they ambushed Sanders and his troop as they rode into town. Opening up on them simultaneously in the darkness from in front and behind, the ten Newtonians managed to scare Sanders' men bad enough that they bolted for the edge of town and rode off into the night. The courthouse at Newton was saved, and though completely unimportant in the larger scheme of things, Carmichael and his men could still claim that they'd whipped a 'Yankee' outfit four times their size.

He was equally accused of having \\"become a terror to the people of west Florida\\" with his \\"armed gang of deserters.\\" Asked to explain himself, Sanders ingeniously asserted that sore feet, sickness among his troops, an alleged enemy force of \\"700 Rebels\\", lack of provider and rising floodwaters all conspired to keep him from returning to Pensacola at the time specified in his orders.Official U.S. Military Record of Joseph G.

General Asboth, in making his final recommendation for approval, made this statement: Death After the war, according to Jessie Carmichael, Joseph Sanders returned to Dale County. Several local citizens, including a man named George Echol, tried to arrest Sanders at his home, \\"doubtless underrating his courage,\\" Carmichael wrote. Having previously warned them against making any such attempts, Sanders shot and killed Echol, and the would-be posse dispersed. Fleeing to Decatur County, Georgia, Sanders built a mill and seemed to have escaped his enemies, until he was murdered there sometime after the war--allegedly, by Echol's father, another Dale County judge.

At his first session in March 1950 he recorded \\"Stack-A-Lee\\" at Cosimo Matassa's J&M; Studio under the direction of bandleader Dave Bartholomew. The song was based on a true story - the shooting of Billy Lyons by \\"Stag\\" Lee Shelton in St Louis, Missouri in 1895 - and had already been recorded by many artists including Ma Rainey, Mississippi John Hurt, and Duke Ellington, but Archibald's version was the first to achieve widespread national success.

He had to cancel a tour that year due to illness, and later recordings failed to match the commercial success of \\"Stack-A-Lee\\".

Ring manufactures home security products that incorporate outdoor motion-detecting cameras, including Ring Video Doorbell. It hosts an app, Neighbors, for online social sharing of captured footage among users. Ring also provides video footage from its cameras and data from its Neighbors app to law enforcement agencies on request. Its police partnerships have been criticized by civil rights advocacy groups as building an invasive private surveillance network.  History = Pre-acquisition (2013‚Äì2017) = In 2013, Ring was founded as Doorbot by Jamie Siminoff. Doorbot was crowdfunded via Christie Street, and raised 364,000, more than the $250,000 requested. In 2013, Siminoff and Doorbot appeared on an episode of the reality series Shark Tank to seek a $700,000 investment in the company, which he estimated was worth $7 million. Kevin O‚ÄôLeary made an offer as a potential investor but Siminoff declined it. After being on Shark Tank, Siminoff rebranded the company which received $5 million in additional sales. In 2016, Shaquille O'Neal acquired an equity stake in Ring, and subsequently became a spokesperson in the company's marketing. The company raised over $200 million in investments from Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, Qualcomm Ventures, Goldman Sachs, DFJ Growth and Sir Richard Branson‚Äîfounder of Virgin Group. = Subsidiary of Amazon (2018‚Äìpresent) = In February 2018, Ring was acquired by Amazon for an estimated value of between $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion. In January 2019, it was uncovered that employees at Ring's two offices had had access to the video recordings from all Ring devices. In addition, The Intercept reported that the video data was stored unencrypted. In June 2019, Ring faced criticism over a \\"Community Alert\\" program, under which the company has made geographically-targeted sponsored posts on social media services such as Facebook, asking readers to provide tips on suspects in verified cases, based on imagery posted on the Neighbors service by a Ring customer. Ring states that it seeks permission from the user before using their content in this manner. However, these discoveries did lead to concerns over the use of such footage in material deemed to effectively be advertising, as well as concerns over other possible uses of the footage (such as for training facial recognition) due to the wide copyright license that users must grant to in order to use Neighbors (an irrevocable, unlimited, and royalty-free license to use shared content \\"for any purpose and in any media formats in any media channels without compensation to you\\"), and Ring's partnerships with local law enforcement agencies. In July 2019, Vice publication Motherboard obtained records revealing the extent of Ring's partnership with the Lakeland (Florida) Police Department (LPD). The department was granted access to a \\"Law Enforcement Neighborhood Portal\\" for making posts on Neighbors and the ability to \\"request videos directly from Ring users,‚Äù and received a donation of 15 Ring cameras. However, the memorandum of understanding stated that the LPD would be required to participate in \\"outreach efforts on the platform to encourage adoption of the platform/app\\" (receiving $10 credits for Ring camera purchases for each new user). Ring also recommended that the LPD establish specific new positions for the partnership, including a \\"social media coordinator\\". Later in the month, Motherboard obtained public records containing an officer's notes from an April 2019 training webinar, which stated that Ring had partnered with at least 200 law enforcement partners. In early-August 2019, Motherboard also reported that Ring would match payments by cities to cover the subsidized purchase of Ring cameras, so that they can be resold to residents at a discount. Cybersecurity firm Bitdefender identified a vulnerability in the Ring Video Doorbell Pro product in July 2019, which was patched before being publicly disclosed in November 2019. Security hackers accessed a number of Ring cameras in December 2019 and used the device speakers to broadcast racial slurs, threats, and other inflammatory language to multiple households across the United States. A Motherboard investigation discovered crime forums that distributed software exploits of Ring devices that were used in the cyberattacks. NulledCast, a podcast on Discord, livestreamed some of the incidents. Ring responded to the incidents by advising its users to have strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and adopt other security measures. Ring mandated two-factor authentication for all users on February 18, 2020. The United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform launched an investigation into Ring's data-sharing partnerships with local governments and police departments on February 19, 2020.  Products and services  Ring Video Doorbell 2 = Ring Video Doorbell = The Ring Video Doorbell is the company's flagship product; it is a smart doorbell that contains a high-definition camera, a motion sensor, and a microphone and speaker for two-way audio communication. It integrates with an associated mobile app, Neighbors, which allows users to view real-time video from the camera, receive notifications when the doorbell is rung, and communicate with visitors at the door via the integrated speaker and microphone. It is also capable of operating as a surveillance camera, and can automatically trigger recordings when rung, or when its motion sensors are activated. A second- generation model, Ring Doorbell 2, was released in 2017, with updated hardware and a 1080p camera with improved low-light performance, that does not rely solely on Wi-Fi, unlike the original model. The \\"Ring Chime\\" accessory is a unit plugged into a power outlet to play the doorbell's chime. The \\"Chime Pro\\" is an extended version that also doubles as a wireless repeater for Wi-Fi networks. = Home security = In 2015, Ring first released the \\"Stick-Up Cam\\", a wireless IP camera. It was updated in 2018 with a cylindrical form factor, motion detection, two-way audio, as well as battery, wired, and solar power options. In 2017, Ring released the \\"Floodlight Cam\\", a camera integrated with a pair of motion-activated LED floodlights.A screencapture from a Ring doorbell In July 2018, Ring launched an alarm security kit, which includes a keypad, siren, and motion sensors. At CES 2019, Ring announced a peephole camera. In September 2020, Ring unveiled several new products, including the \\"Always Home Cam\\" ‚Äî an aerial indoor camera that flies a predetermined path when activated by an alarm sensor. = Automotive security = In September 2020, Ring unveiled a new line of automotive products‚Äîincluding the Ring Car Alarm and Car Cam. Car Alarm is an OBD-II car alarm that can send alerts of events such as break-ins via Ring and Amazon Alexa. It will leverage Amazon Sidewalk for connectivity. Car Cam consists of a dashcam and a rear window camera to capture the interior. It features similar car alarm functionality, as well as \\"emergency crash assist\\" to automatically notify emergency services if a \\"serious crash\\" is detected, and a \\"traffic stop\\" voice command. In addition, Ring announced Car Connect‚Äîa platform that will allow automakers to integrate existing cameras and security systems within vehicles (such as backup cameras) into the Ring platform. Tesla was announced as the first partner for Car Connect, with plans to offer an aftermarket accessory for the Model 3, Model X, Model S, and Model Y in 2021 = Subscription plans = Ring products require a \\"Ring Protect\\" subscription plan in order to store and view recordings from the cameras; without a subscription, the user is limited to real-time footage only. The \\"Ring Protect Basic\\" plan allows footage to be retained for 60 days, while the \\"Ring Protect Plus\\" subscription adds \\"unlimited\\" storage of footage, enables professional monitoring and LTE cellular backup on the Ring Alarm, and extends the warranty on the user's Ring products from one year to the life of the devices. = Neighbors app = In 2018, Ring launched Neighbors, a hyperlocal social networking app. Described as being akin to a neighborhood watch, it allows users to crowdsource information on and discuss safety and security concerns in their area. The service allows users to share footage captured from Ring products, so that others can help to identify suspects. All user posts are anonymous and do not include specific location information, and are moderated to remove off-topic content (in contrast to services such as Nextdoor, it focuses exclusively on crime and safety). Ring also has partnerships with local police departments in some cities to incorporate Neighbors into their crime monitoring processes, and they are also able to make official posts for distribution on the service. Ring has credited the service with having helped to solve crimes, and noted that activity on the service surged in California regions affected by wildfires in November 2018. Amazon disclosed Ring's criteria for accepting requests from police departments for video footage shared to the Neighbors portal in a response to Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey on November 1, 2019. Each police request must be associated with a case number and submitted individually, although no evidence is needed. Ring provides at most 12 hours of footage recorded within the previous 45 days in a maximum search area of 0.5 square miles for each request. Markey criticized Amazon's response, describing Ring as \\"an open door for privacy and civil liberty violations\\". Police departments may access user-generated footage through the Ring Neighborhoods portal by request, using a map interface. After a police officer requests video from a list of houses, Ring sends all affected users automated messages requesting permission to release the footage.  Reception = Products = TechHive gave the second-generation Ring doorbell a 4 out of 5, noting improvements in hardware and ease of installation over the first-generation model, but criticizing a lack of printed and online documentation. = Police partnerships = Digital rights advocacy group Fight for the Future criticized Ring for using its cameras and Neighbors app to build a private surveillance network via partnerships with local law enforcement agencies, which encourage them to promote the products. The group stated that these partnerships \\"undermine our democratic process and basic civil liberties\\". According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Ring used these partnerships and its marketing strategies to foster fear, which leads to a \\"vicious cycle\\" that spurs hardware sales. The organization said that Ring, as well as Neighbors and similar \\"neighborhood watch\\" apps such as Citizen and Nextdoor, \\"facilitate reporting of so-called 'suspicious' behavior that really amounts to racial profiling.\\" Matt Cagle of the American Civil Liberties Union said that the Ring Neighbors Portal \\"blurs the line between corporate and government surveillance\\" and that \\"Many people are not going to feel like they have a choice when law enforcement asks for access to their footage\\". = Security = In a December 2019 test, Motherboard found that Ring's software did not implement \\"basic security features\\", allowing the publication to access a Ring account from IP addresses based in multiple countries without warning the user. = Allegations of user tracking = On January 27, 2020, the Electronic Frontier Foundation concluded that the Ring doorbell app for Android was sending identifiable personal information‚Äì including names, IP addresses, mobile network carriers, persistent IDs and sensor data ‚Äìto four analytics and marketing companies: Facebook, Mixpanel, AppsFlyer and branch.io.

Five Points of Architecture Early in his career, Le Corbusier developed a set of architectural principles that dictated his technique, which he called \\"the Five Points of a New Architecture\\" (French: cinq points de l'architecture moderne). They are considered to be most evident in his Villa Savoye. The five points are: * Pilotis ‚Äì replacement of supporting walls by a grid of reinforced concrete columns that bears the structural load is the basis of the new aesthetic * The free designing of the ground plan ‚Äì the absence of supporting walls ‚Äì means the house is unrestrained in its internal use * The free design of the fa√ßade ‚Äì separating the exterior of the building from its structural function ‚Äì sets the fa√ßade free from structural constraints * The horizontal window, which cuts the fa√ßade along its entire length, lights rooms equally * Roof gardens on a flat roof can serve a domestic purpose while providing essential protection to the concrete roof. Villa Savoye Villa Savoye It was Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye (1929‚Äì1931) that most succinctly summed up his five points of architecture that he had elucidated in the journal L'Esprit Nouveau and his book Vers une architecture, which he had been developing throughout the 1920s. First, Le Corbusier lifted the bulk of the structure off the ground, supporting it by pilotis ‚Äì reinforced concrete stilts. These pilotis, in providing the structural support for the house, allowed him to elucidate his next two points: a free fa√ßade, meaning non- supporting walls that could be designed as the architect wished, and an open floor plan, meaning that the floor space was free to configure into rooms without concern for supporting walls. The second floor of the Villa Savoye includes long strips of ribbon windows that allow unencumbered views of the large surrounding yard, and constitute the fourth point of his system. This is a strength to enjoy panoramic scenery while complementing the climatic weakness of Western Europe, which lacked sunshine. The fifth point was the roof garden to compensate for the green area consumed by the building and replacing it on the roof. A ramp rising from ground level to the third floor roof terrace allows for a promenade architecturale through the structure. The white tubular railing recalls the industrial \\"ocean-liner\\" aesthetic that Le Corbusier much admired. The driveway around the ground floor, with its semicircular path, measures the exact turning radius of a 1927 Citro√´n automobile. Carpenter Center The Carpenter Center The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University was Le Corbusier's only building in the United States, and he aimed to incorporate his Five Points into the design of the building.

The farces were directed by Tom Walls, who co-starred in most of them with Ralph Lynn, and a supporting cast of regular Aldwych performers. The play is a spoof of detective plays and thrillers, with the two stars successfully taking on a criminal gang. Eventually, the gang is rounded up, and the jewels taken from the heroine are restored to their proper owner. The piece opened at the Aldwych Theatre on 18 February 1930 and ran until 15 November, a total of 267 performances.\\"The Theatres\\", The Times 13 November 1930, p. 12; and \\"Mr. Ralph Lynn\\", The Times, 10 August 1962, p. 11 Background A Night Like This was the seventh in the series of twelve Aldwych farces, and the sixth written by Travers. The first four in the series, It Pays to Advertise, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Rookery Nook and Thark had long runs, averaging more than 400 performances each. The next two were more modest successes: Plunder (1928) ran for 344 performances, and A Cup of Kindness (1929) for 291. Like its predecessors, the play was produced and directed by Tom Walls, who co-starred with Ralph Lynn, a specialist in playing \\"silly ass\\" characters. The regular company of supporting actors included Robertson Hare, who played a figure of put-upon respectability; Mary Brough in eccentric old lady roles; Ethel Coleridge as the severe voice of authority; Winifred Shotter as the sprightly young female lead; and the saturnine Gordon James.Trussler, p. 278 Original cast *Knee ‚Äì Gordon James *Edgar Pryor ‚Äì John R Turnbull *Mrs Decent ‚Äì Mary Brough *Cora Mellish ‚Äì Winifred Shotter *Aubrey Slot ‚Äì Kenneth Kove *Mary Deane ‚Äì Doreen Bendix *Mrs Knee ‚Äì Ethel Coleridge *PC Michael Marsden ‚Äì Tom Walls *Amy ‚Äì Margot Grahame *Clifford Tope ‚Äì Ralph Lynn *Miles Tuckett ‚Äì Robertson Hare *Craggy ‚Äì Louis Bradfield *Snake Lloyd ‚Äì Archibald Batty *Cabman ‚Äì Fred Morgan *Mrs Tuckett ‚Äì Norma Varden *Detective Inspector Curtis ‚Äì Philip Carlton\\"Aldwych Theatre\\", The Times , 19 February 1930, p. 12 Synopsis Edgar Pryor runs a shady gambling club with the aid of various henchmen, including Knee, Craggy and Lloyd.

Her boyfriend, Aubrey ‚Äì nephew of the real owner of the necklace ‚Äì is too ineffectual to help, but she gains three champions in the form of Mrs Decent, Clifford Tope and Police Constable Michael Marsden. Marsden is cornered in the gambling den by two of the gang and puts up a strong fight, which he wins with ease when Tope appears through the window armed with a poker and lays out the assailants (see picture above). Marsden and Tope go in pursuit of the rest of the gang. They requisition the only available cab, immobilising the rightful passenger, Miles Tuckett, by separating him from his trousers.

Born and raised in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, El Metro 4 initiated his criminal career by working with Los Metros, an enforcer gang of the Gulf Cartel. After several years, his position in the cartel grew, and he later became the regional leader in Reynosa, Tamaulipas and the right-hand man of the drug lord Mario Ram√≠rez Trevi√±o. Although no official reports have been released, several media outlets alleged that El Metro 4 was found dead in Reynosa on 15 January 2013. The motives behind his murder are still unknown, but the two prevailing theories suggest that he was killed by the rival gang Los Zetas or betrayed by members of his own cartel. Criminal career H√©ctor David Delgado Santiago was born and raised in the Mexican border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas on 23 December 1975. His father was a former customs broker in the area. He started his criminal career as a gang member for Los Metros, a muscle group of the drug trafficking organization known as the Gulf Cartel. As time passed, El Metro 4 became acquainted with some corrupt Mexican law enforcement officials, and his rank in the Gulf Cartel grew. Delgado Santiago, unlike other drug traffickers of his time like Gregorio Sauceda-Gamboa (Metro 2) and Samuel Flores Borrego (Metro 3), managed to keep a low-profile by working alongside corrupt law enforcement and staying out of the Mexican and U.S. authorities' radar. At some point in his career, El Metro 4 worked as the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Reynosa, Tamaulipas and as the right-hand man of the current leader Mario Ram√≠rez Trevi√±o. Between September and October 2012, El Metro 4 was riding a battered old car (to avoid detection by the military) while heading to R√≠o Bravo, Tamaulipas when he was pulled over by the transit police. The police tried to extort him, and did not believe he was a Gulf Cartel leader. \\"Feeling offended, he punished them all...\\" and forced all of the transit police in the area to do patrolling on foot for approximately six weeks for pulling him over. El Metro 4 was known by authorities on both sides of the border as a coldblooded and ruthless assassin. In 2011, the Texas Department of Public Safety indicated that he had given orders to his henchmen to fire at U.S. agents if they interfered with drug shipments of the cartel. There were also several attacks carried out in the United States that were attributed to El Metro 4, who had a reputation of disregarding \\"borders when scores needed to be settled.\\" =Cartel infighting= On 2 September 2011, the bullet-ridden body of Samuel Flores Borrego was found in the outskirts of Reynosa. Preliminary reports suggested, however, that he was abducted, tortured, and executed by members of his own cartel. With his death, the Gulf Cartel separated into two factions: one faction was known as Los Rojos, which was originally composed by members loyal to the family of the imprisoned leader Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n; the second faction was called Los Metros, and was headed by the former leader Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. In an effort to find those responsible, El Metro 4 worked with Osiel's nephew Rafael C√°rdenas Vela (El Junior) and decided that they were going to lead an investigation inside the Gulf Cartel. =Disappearance and death= Although there is not an official statement from the U.S. and Mexican authorities, several media outlets that cited \\"extra- official sources\\" alleged that El Metro 4 was killed in Reynosa, Tamaulipas on early hours of the morning on 15 January 2013. Initial reports indicated that he was wounded in a shootout and was taken to a local hospital, where he later died of complications from the gunshot wounds he received. It was later indicated, however, that the man who died in the hospital was another top criminal in the Gulf Cartel, and that El Metro 4 had actually disappeared a few days before and that his body was found dead by the Mexican authorities in Reynosa. There are two different versions surrounding the motives behind El Metro 4's death: (1) one of them is that he was killed by rival gang members of Los Zetas, who managed to make an incursion in Reynosa; (2) the other version is that he was betrayed and killed by members of his own cartel. InSight Crime believes that if Los Zetas were responsible for his death, the attack was probably a direct response to the Gulf Cartel incursions in Monterrey in 2012. In addition, Reynosa is typically regarded as a stronghold of the Gulf Cartel, but it has not been immune to incursions by Los Zetas. If El Metro 4 was betrayed, it remains unclear for whom the assassins were working, whether or not some Gulf Cartel members shifted to Los Zetas, or if it was an internal strife. ;Aftermath On the night of 10 March 2013, a three- hour gun battle broke out between alleged rival factions of the Gulf Cartel in the streets of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Government reports suggest that two innocent civilians were killed in the crossfire, but a law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the incident indicated that at least 36 people were killed; the number may even be higher, considering that Gulf Cartel gunmen managed to pick up the bodies of their fallen soldiers. Large armed convoys of over a dozen vehicles with the signs \\"M4\\" were seen throughout the city. According to Valor por Tamaulipas, the shootout was caused by a power struggle within the Gulf Cartel, which skyrocketed with the death of El Metro 4. Borderland Beat indicated that Los Metros gang of the Gulf Cartel experienced several disputes with Miguel El Gringo Villarreal and El Commandante Puma, leaders of another group within the cartel. Although no official reports exists, there are rumors that El Commandante Puma were killed in the gunfight.

Biography Burney was born in London in 1923 to the British naval officer and politician Dennistoun Burney (a Conservative Party MP for Uxbridge) and his American wife Gladys. He was educated at Eton College and then joined the Royal Navy in 1942, serving as a radar officer in the Arctic convoys. After the war he attended Trinity College, Cambridge and studied engineering, also rowing for the college. After leaving university, Burney moved to Northern Rhodesia to work for Anglo American in the Nchanga Mines in 1948. In 1951 he established a car dealership named Northern Motors, and in 1957 he married Hazel Coleman, with whom he had two sons. Between 1956 and 1959 he was President of the Northern Rhodesia Motor Traders' Association. In the 1959 general elections, Burney contested the Ndola seat in the Legislative Council as the United Federal Party candidate, and was elected with 58% of the vote.\\"Northern Rhodesian Election Results\\", East Africa and Rhodesia, 2 April 1959, p913 He subsequently became deputy to UFP leader John Roberts.Sir Cecil Burney, Bt The Telegraph, 17 May 2002 The Ndola seat was abolished prior to the 1962 general elections and Burney successfully ran for re-election in the Luanshya‚ÄìKansenji seat. The 1964 general elections saw ten 'reserved roll' seats created for the European population, with Burney running for re-election in the recreated Ndola seat as a member of the new National Progressive Party. He was re-elected to the Legislative Council, which became the National Assembly upon independence later in the year, and chaired the Public Accounts Committee. The National Progressive Party was dissolved in 1966, after which its former members sat as independents. He remained a member of the National Assembly until the 1968 elections, prior to which the reserved roll seats were abolished. Burney succeeded his father to the Burney baronetcy in 1968, and returned to England in 1970. He joined the Conservative Party and was president of the West Berkshire Conservative Association, but was told that he was too old to stand for Parliament. After giving up his chairmanship of Northern Motors in 1972, he became chair of the Hampton Trust property firm in 1975, later working with Michael Ashcroft.

The battery was built by the British in 1854, and it is connected to the earlier St. Peter & Paul Bastion of the Valletta Land Front. In World War II, the Lascaris War Rooms were dug close to the battery, and they served as Britain's secret headquarters for the defence of the island. History View of the Valletta Marina in 1848, with ƒ†nien is-Sultan on the site of Lascaris Battery When the British took over the Maltese islands in 1800, they used the fortifications built by the Order of St. John almost without alterations. Under the military theory of the time, the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean was regarded as the most reliable protection against invasion. However, during his time as governor, Sir William Reid ordered gun batteries to be added inside the Grand Harbour, in order to repel any ships which broke through the cordon of Fort St. Elmo and Fort St. Angelo and penetrated the harbour. Construction of Lascaris Battery therefore began in 1854, on the site of ƒ†nien is-Sultan, a garden that had been built by Grand Master Giovanni Paolo Lascaris. The battery was thus named after this Grand Master. During the Second World War, the Lascaris War Rooms were dug under the Upper Barrakka Gardens and the casemates of the Lascaris Battery, into rock. The network of tunnels and chambers located below the Upper Barrakka Gardens and the Saluting Battery were used as ‚ÄúThe War Rooms‚Äù of Britain‚Äôs War HQ in Malta. The facility later housed the headquarters of the Allied invasion of Sicily during mid-1943. On 24 December 1941, Lascaris Battery, along with the Upper Barrakka Gardens and the Saluting Battery, were damaged in an air raid. The damaged parts were later rebuilt. Features Saluting Battery in the foreground, with the RML 9-inch gun emplacement at Lascaris Battery in the background A high bastion was built on the harbour side of SS Peter and Paul Bastion, below the rectangular Saluting Battery. Lascaris Battery has an irregular trapezoid shape with rounded corners. A shooting platform extends from the right flank. A parade ground was located inside the new bastion. Beginning in 1868, the two-storey casemates were converted to barracks, which, as a result, have open galleries facing the parade ground. At the beginning of the 1860s, the battery was equipped with fourteen 8-inch 9-ton RML guns. In addition, four 10-inch 18-ton guns were stationed on the left flank of the battery. On an additional platform beneath the left flank of the saluting battery were three 10-inch howitzers. In 1884, the battery was armed with seven 64-pound 64-cwt RML guns in the casemates, which were protected by a wall approximately thick. Since these guns were outmoded, they had to be replaced by more modern artillery. A 9-inch 12-ton RML gun was mounted on the battery on an open barbette in a very exposed situation. The powder store, with a capacity of , was protected only by walls and roof. Overall, the construction of the battery was outdated and the installation was no longer able to defend against modern artillery.

It publishes work of a new generation of Algerian writers.Prince Claus Fund (2010) profile Barzakh within islam is the period between someone's death and his resurrection at the Last Judgment and the stay in the akhirah afterwards. Barzakh was founded by Selma Hellal and Sofiane Hadjadj in the year of 2000, during the last years of the Algerian Civil War. In these years the conflicts in the country were greatly isolated form the world outside. According to the jury of the Prince Claus Awards in 2010, the foundation of this publishing house was elemental for opening the door again between Algeria and the rest of the world. Initially it had been the purpose to publish work of writers of Algerian soil only. Hellal and Hadjadj noticed though, that the civil war had caused that a great number of writers had fled abroad. For this reason the focus changed to publish work of authors that lived in exile as well as giving a chance to authors who otherwise probably wouldn't have had a chance.European Cultural Foundation (2 January 2007) Interview with Sofiane Hadjadj, co- director of Barzakh Editions An important mainspring for the founders was the passion for books and the trust that freedom of thought and of expression are essential for development. Up to 2010 the house had published more than 110 books, varying mainly between novels and poetry. Furthermore, books have been published in areas like philosophy, photography, drama, politics, art, and more. As from the start the house has been dependent from mainly European sponsors, because the circumstances and the nature of the publications caused that the publisher wasn't viable on itself. For instance the French embassy in Algiers had mercy on the cost for establishing copyrights for the books. Furthermore, the Swiss government and a number of funds offered financial support to the publisher. In 2010 Barzakh Editions was honored with the Principal Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands. The jury praised it among other things for giving concrete form to Algeria‚Äôs voices, for opening up a much needed space for critical reflection on Algerian realities, for building a bridge connecting different languages and cultures, and for creatively breaking through the threatening cultural isolation of the country.\\"  References  Publishing companies established in 2010 Companies of Algeria Algerian culture Mass media in Algeria ","title":"Barzakh Editions"},{"id":"38575149","text":"The Huaneng Geermu Solar Park is a 50 MWp photovoltaic power station located in the Qinghai Province, in China.

The heist was accomplished without a shot being fired. Robbery The robbers hid in a construction site outside the airport prior to the robbery. They were armed with Kalashnikov-type assault rifles and dressed as police officers. Entering the airport through a hole they created in the airport security fence, the robbers drove on the property with two vehicles, a Mercedes van and an Audi, both of which were black with flashing blue police lights. They drove straight to the airplane where the gems were being transferred from a Brink's armored van, which had driven from Antwerp, onto the Fokker 100 twin engine jet Swiss Flight LX789, which was bound for Zurich. The time between the loading procedure and the moment the plane started to move to take off would only have lasted 15 minutes according to Caroline De Wolf, a spokeswoman for the Antwerp World Diamond Centre. De Wolf stated that the window for opportunity was so small that the perpetrators must have known ahead of time about the transfer procedures and timing. The robbers stopped the plane then brandished their guns, stopping the pilots and transport security. The Brussels prosecutors' office described the weapons used as \\"like Kalashnikovs\\", most likely the Galil. The robbers never dropped their weapons. The robbers loaded 130 bags into their cars and drove off, but left behind some gems in their hurry. The whole robbery took about 20 minutes. The robbery did not appear to disturb any of the passengers, who did not know that anything had happened until they were told to disembark because the flight had been cancelled. The van believed to be used in the robbery was later found abandoned and burned. In May 2013, 31 people were arrested in connection with the theft, and some of the diamonds were recovered. Charges were brought against 19 of those (16 men and 3 women). In contrast to the clockwork execution of the robbery, the arrests came as a result of mistakes made when the suspects tried to sell the stolen goods. Pascal Pont, a Swiss real estate agent, was given a large sack of diamonds from his friend Marc Bertoldi, a luxury car dealer from the French Riviera, whose car was discovered in the vicinity of the robbery. Pont was investigated for his relationship with Bertoldi, and by monitoring his phone calls, police uncovered Pont's unsuccessful attempts to fence the diamonds in Geneva, which is not a city known for its diamond trade. The trial was scheduled to begin in September 2017, but it was delayed because Bertoldi was serving a sentence in a French prison for kidnapping and could not be extradited. Bertoldi admitted to having received diamonds stolen in the robbery, but denied any involvement. In May 2018, 18 of those tried in connection to the heist were acquitted. The case against Bertoldi, the suspected mastermind, was yet to be heard, pending the outcome of his appeal over his kidnapping conviction. In June 2019, the correctional tribunal of Brussels sentenced Bertoldi to five years of imprisonment and a fine for being a co-conspirator in the heist, for being part of a criminal organisation and for money laundering. The tribunal did not consider him to be the mastermind behind the heist however, contrary to the prosecutor. Reaction Belgian prosecutor Ine Van Wymersch said the thieves \\"were very, very professional\\". French airport security consultant Doron Levy said that he was, \\"certain this was an inside job\\", adding the heist was \\"incredibly audacious and well organized\\" and that big jobs like that were often so well organized that the thieves \\"probably know the employees by name\\".

Known for the creation of the Sealyham Terrier there in the 1800s, the house served as a sanatorium and medical facility from 1923 to 1964. Since 1986 it has been a children's activity centre.  History  King Edward III granted some land at Sealyham in Pembrokeshire (Wales) to Thomas Tucker in the fourteenth century. Tucker was a captain in the King's army about 1356. From that time the Tuckers remained identified with the manor until 1777.Their monument in the church at St. Dogwells (Llan ty Dewi) is noted in Fenton 1811:339. Tucker married Ursula del Holme and they built a house at this Sealyham property, which is some southwest of Liverpool. The house was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. In 1777 the heiress to the property, Mary Tucker, married John-Owen Edwardes.Elizabeth Tucker married John Owen Edwardes, according to James Allen (Dean of St. David's), Notes on the Sheriffs of Pembrokeshire, 1541-1899, 1900, s.v. \\"1763 John Tucker\\", \\"1829 John Owen Edwardes\\". Their heir was William Edwardes (d. 1825), who was succeeded by William Edwardes-Tucker. Captain John Edwardes was a descendant of this couple. In 1840, Tucker-Edwardes was married to Anna Jane Jones of Letterston (Wales) and their only son was John Tucker-Edwardes (1845) who married Hester Phillips. He died in 1891 (at 82 years of age) and his father also died in the same year. As they had no offspring Sealyham House became the property of John Owen's brother, Owen, who also died two years later in 1893; his son Charles Gustaves Whittaker Edwardes who inherited the property died in 1902 without any children. John Edwardes bred the Sealyham Terrier rare Welsh breed dog. It turned out the last of the descendant family members to live at the Sealyham Mansion was Catherine Octavia Edwards. She married Victor James Higgon. In 1905, they moved to Treffgarne Hall. Around 1910, portions of the land were sold to the Pembrokeshire County Council. In 1920, Sealyham Mansion and its immediate associated land were sold to the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association. The estate was converted into a tuberculosis hospital with 30 beds. It continued to function as a tuberculosis hospital to 1954. In 1955, it was re-purposed for elderly patients, but was permanently closed as a medical facility in 1964. In 1970, the Sealyham Mansion was sold to Nancy Ellen Perkins. She converted it into an apartment building as rentals. In 1980, it was sold again to an investment firm that used it for an outdoor activities center. It was resold in 1986 to the Sealyham Activity Centre for young people as an educational facility. Sealyham Terrier The Tucker-Edwardes family of the 1800s were one of the leading landowners of Pembrokeshire.The family title, held by a cousin, is Baron Kensington. Headed by Captain John Edwardes (1808-91), the family had the time and the means to breed dogs, which was almost a prerogative of people of noble families or military background. The Welsh Corgi, Fox Terrier (Wire), and the now extinct English White Terrier all played a part in the make up of the Sealyham, although Edwardes did not keep records. After Edwardes' death in 1891, other breeders began to work with Sealyhams, including Fred Lewis who promoted the breed.

Set during the first stage of the Hundred Years War, the novel follows Thomas of Hookton's quest to find the Holy Grail, a relic which may grant decisive victory to the possessor. Plot summary Heretic begins with a bloody battle outside Calais in 1347, a short time before the city fell to the English. The sympathetic Thomas of Hookton is bending every sinew at the service of his master, the Earl of Northampton; after risking his life time and again, Thomas finds himself commissioned to track down the most sacred relic in Christendom, the Holy Grail. He travels to Gascony, seat of power of his nemesis, Guy Vexille. With his cunning, Thomas is able to take control of a fictional fortress town and there meets Genevieve, a local woman about to be burned at the stake for witchcraft. Thomas saves her, however the action costs him dearly for he is later excommunicated. As he realises he is losing respect and approval amongst his men, Thomas is forced to abandon the fastness and begins journeying through Gascony with Genevieve. Rejoining with his band of archers later in the plot, Thomas conducts a fierce guerrilla war against Vexille, and yearns for a face-to-face encounter.

The area has traditionally been difficult to access and therefore the traces of human influence are very limited. It even served as a refuge for local people during times of war. Oil shale mining in the vicinity, as well as intensified forestry, are today the major threats to the area's unique environment. The area is home to a number of rare or protected species. From the fauna, gray wolf and Eurasian lynx can be mentioned, as well as several birds - it is the most important nesting area in Estonia for the common greenshank and home to both white-tailed eagle and golden eagle.

The band was founded by Jeremy Bolm of Touch√© Amor√©; guitarist Neeraj Kane of The Hope Conspiracy and formerly of The Suicide File and Holy Fever; bassist Stephen LaCour of True Cross and formerly of Trap Them; and Jay Weinberg, the son of Max Weinberg (E Street Band, The Max Weinberg 7), who previously performed with Madball and Against Me!, and eventually joined Slipknot. In 2012, Bolm wanted to gather a group of musicians he was a fan of and quickly record some songs together. He recruited Kane and LaCour, who had met before but never recorded together, and Weinberg, who Bolm knew through Against Me! but had never met either of the other members. Under the name Hesitation Wounds, the group met in California and wrote three songs and an intro in about 5 hours in May of that year. The group felt that the songs were \\"awesome\\" and recorded them the following day. These songs comprised the band's self-titled 7\\" debut EP that was released nearly a year later in April 2013 through Secret Voice, an imprint of Deathwish Inc. and founded by Bolm. Hesitation Wounds only performed a small handful of live performances in support of the EP before the members grew busy with their primary bands. Hesitation Wounds reconvened years later to record their debut studio album Awake for Everything, due out on May 27, 2016 through 6131 Records. Contrasting the impulsive nature of their EP, on Awake for Everything the band went into the writing process striving to harness the aggressive sounds of the 90s hardcore band Deadguy. The album was written in three days in mid-2015, recorded \\"in segments over time\\" with Alex Estrada and mixed by Kurt Ballou of Converge. Bolm's lyrics are said to be a mixture of personal and political themes, the latter of which he feels isn't the right fit for his primary band, Touch√© Amor√©. Promotion for Awake for Everything began with an online stream of \\"Teeth\\", which Bolm said \\"reflects the musical background of each member into one short tune.\\" The band also streamed the track \\"Guthrie\\" prior to the album's release, which was inspired by the original lyrics to Woody Guthrie's folk song \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" and current media coverage of the United States' illegal immigrant population. Recorded in only a few days with Zach Tuch, Hesitation Wounds will release its second studio album Chicanery through Deathwish Inc. on August 30, 2019. For this record, Thomas Cantwell of Gouge Away replaced Weinberg on drums. Chicanery is expected to continue with the political leanings of Awake for Everything.

She practiced and preached an alternative, feminized version of Christianity in which she predicted the end of time and her own resurrection as the Holy Spirit incarnate. She is now the unofficial patron saint of Brunate. A painting from ca. 1450 depicting Guglielma blessing Abbess Maddalena Albrizzi and an unknown donor hangs in the Church of San Andrea in Brunate. Barbara Newman has attempted to identify the kneeling figures in the painting as Guglielma's followers, Sister Maifreda da Pirovano and Andrea Saramita, but this is contested. Life Guglielma arrived in Milan around 1260 with her son. Apparently a widow, she adopted the life of a pinzochera a religious woman living independently in her own home, much like the beguines of northern Europe. In Milan she soon attracted disciples from the elite classes of the city, as well as among the Umiliati, a lay urban religious movement that operated on the fringes of heresy. When she died, some time between 1279 and 1282, her body was buried in the Cistercian monastery at Chiaravalle; the burial site soon became a shrine and a cult sprang up around her. The Guglielmites were led by a sister of the Umiliati movement, Maifreda da Piovano, who was elected their pope and performed Mass over Guglielma's grave. Maifreda was the first cousin of Matteo Visconti, the Ghibelline (anti- papal party) ruler of Milan. Their creed declared that Guglielma's resurrection would herald a new church led by women. For obvious reasons, this attracted the attention of the Inquisition. In 1300, thirty Guglielmites were charged with heresy. Guglielma herself was posthumously condemned on the basis of a confession almost certainly extracted by torture from Andrea Saramita, one of Guglielma's most fervent disciples during her lifetime. Guglielma's bones were disinterred and burned, and three of her devotees, including Maifreda, were sent to the stake. Guglielma as the daughter of the King of Bohemia Since the inquisitors burned her followers' original writings, the only surviving primary source regarding Guglielma's life is the record of the trials of her followers (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana A.227), which is itself incomplete but includes four official notebooks filled with interrogations and depositions. When questioning Saramita, the inquisitors asked \\"if he knew or had heard where this Guglielma was from. He answered yes, she was a daughter of the late King of Bohemia, as it was said. Asked if he had sought out the truth concerning this, he answered yes: he, Andrea, had gone to the king of Bohemia and found the king dead, and found that it was so.\\" This cryptic testimony was confirmed by a secular priest, Mirano da Garbagnate, who had accompanied Saramita on his journey from Milan to Prague. In February 1302, long after the burning of Guglielma's bones, the lay brother Marchisio Secco testified in the mopping-up phase of the trial that she \\"had been a woman of good birth, and it was said that she was a sister of the king of Bohemia.\\" The kings in question would have been Premysl Otakar I (regn. 1198-1230), Guglielma's father, and his son and heir, Wenceslas or Vaclav I (regn. 1230-1253). If Guglielma was a daughter of Premysl Otakar I by his second wife, Queen Constance of Hungary, then she was also a first cousin of St. Elizabeth of Hungary (d. 1231); a half-sister of Dagmar of Bohemia (d. 1212/13), who married King Waldemar II of Denmark and was revered as a saint in that land; and a full sister of St. Agnes of Prague (d. 1282), a Poor Clare abbess whose canonization was first proposed in 1328, though not achieved until 1989. The only problem with this scenario is the absence of any corroborating Bohemian documents. Guglielma couldn't be her true name because she was born in Bohemia. It is the Italian translation of the name Vilelmina and in this way is proved she was the daughter of king Ottokar I Premysil. In fact king Ottokar I and his wife had a daughter with the name Vilelmina Blanchena. The reemergence of Saint Guglielma A full-length hagiographic vita, written in 1425 by Antonio Bonfadini, a friar of Ferrara (d. 1428), reveals that St. Guglielma's popular cult had not only survived the inquisition of 1300, but spread well beyond the confines of Milan. Nothing is known of this author except that he also produced a collection of sermons and one other vernacular saint's life. Bonfadini's vita did not circulate widely. In fact, it survives in a single manuscript, which remained with the Franciscan friars of Ferrara until the time of Napoleon. But either his text or one derived from it eventually reached a Florentine humanist, Antonia Pulci (1452-1501), whose version gave the tale far greater currency. Pulci was a play-wright who wrote convent dramas; after her husband's death in 1487 she lived as a pinzochera in Florence, just as Guglielma herself had done two centuries earlier in Milan. The Play of Saint Guglielma, one of seven dramas in Pulci's canon, versifies Bonfadini's legend in rhyming eight-line stanzas broken up among the dramatis personae, and wisely simplifies its plot. The Visconti Family and Saint Guglielma Manifreda da Piovano was a first cousin of Matteo Visconti, who since 1287 had been Captain General and by 1300 was lord of Milan. Barbara Newman theorizes that Matteo Visconti confiscated and ultimately preserved the inquisitorial record of the trail of Guglielma and her followers. Newman also writes: \\"Guglielma's heretication had tarnished the career of Milan's first lord, Matteo Visconti, but in compensation her sanctity would brighten the life of the last Visconti, Duchess Bianca Maria (1424-68), the wife of the military captain Francesco Sforza.\\" The Papessa card of the Visconti-Sforza tarot deck, commissioned by Duchess Bianca Maria Visconti, represents Sister Maifreda da Pirovano-an attribution first made by Gertrude Moakley in 1966, well before modern historians had rediscovered the Guglielmites. Bianca Maria was also the patron of the painting depicting Saint Guglielma that still hangs in the Church of San Andrea in Brunate. Founded by two sisters as a hermitage in 1340, the tiny church of San Andrea was a poor, struggling monastery of nuns for almost three hundred years before Maddalena Albrizzi decided to enter it around 1420. Albrizzi came of a distinguished family in Como, so her choice of the austere Brunate rather than Santa Margherita, the aristocratic Benedictine house she had first planned to enter, is quite surprising. Newman concludes her study with this: \\"Thus two women of the fifteenth century, a devout princess and a spiritually ambitious nun, joined forces to revive the good fame of two other women a devout princess and a spiritually ambitious nun who had long ago fired their friends with hope and ardor.\\" NotesBibliography * Patrizia Costa, Guglielma la Boema, l'\\"eretica\\" di Chiaravalle (Milan: NED, 1985) * Luisa Muraro, Guglielma e Maifreda: Storia di un'eresia femminista (Milan: Tartaruga, 1985) * Marina Benedetti, Io non sono Dio: Guglielma di Milano e i Figli dello Spirito santo (Milan: Edizioni Biblioteca Francescana, 1998) 13th-century births 1280s deaths People from Milan 13th-century Italian people Roman Catholic mystics Folk saints People convicted of heresy ","title":"Guglielma"},{"id":"38575608","text":"The Prince Regnant of Liechtenstein (German: F√ºrst von Liechtenstein) is the monarch and head of state of Liechtenstein.Principality of Liechtenstein Family - Die f√ºrstliche Familie (in German) The princely family of Liechtenstein, after which the sovereign principality was named in 1719, hails from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria, which the family possessed from at least 1140 to the thirteenth century, and from 1807 onward. It is the only remaining European monarchy that practises strict agnatic primogeniture, meaning only first-born males may inherit the throne. History Through the centuries, the dynasty acquired vast swathes of land, predominantly in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia, and Styria, though in all cases, these territories were held in fief under other more senior feudal lords, particularly under various lines of the Habsburg family, to whom several Liechtenstein princes served as close advisors. Without any territory held immediately from the Imperial crown, the Liechtenstein family, although noble, did not qualify for a seat in the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire. By purchase in 1699 and 1712 from the counts of Waldburg-Zeil-Hohenem of, respectively, the small lordship of Schellenberg and the county of Vaduz, the Liechtensteins acquired immediate lands within the Holy Roman Empire which made them eligible for elevation to the Imperial Diet. Thereby, on 23 January 1719 Emperor Charles VI decreed Vaduz and Schellenberg were henceforth united and raised to the status of a F√ºrstentum (principality) under the name \\"Liechtenstein\\" for \\"[his] true servant, Anton Florian of Liechtenstein\\". Although the family continued to own larger territories in various parts of central and eastern Europe, it was in right of Liechtenstein's status as an Imperial estate that the family of wealthy noble Austrian courtiers became a dynasty of imperial princes, continuing to dwell in the imperial capital of Vienna or on their larger estates elsewhere, not taking up permanent residence in their principality for more than 300 years, moving into their Alpine realm only in 1938, after dissolution of both the Holy Roman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Powers The prince of Liechtenstein has broad powers, which include the appointment of judges, the dismissal of ministers or government, veto power, and the calling of referendums. The Liechtenstein constitutional referendum, 2003 was a proposal put forth by Prince Hans-Adam II to revise parts of the Constitution of Liechtenstein, on the one hand expanding the monarch's power with the authority to veto legislation, while on the other hand securing for the citizenry the option to abolish the monarchy by vote at any time without being subject to princely veto.Liechtenstein prince wins powers BBC News Online, 16 March 2003. Retrieved 29 December 2006. The right of the parishes that make up the principality to secede was simultaneously recognised. Prince Hans-Adam had warned that he and his family would move to Austria if the referendum were rejected. Despite opposition from Mario Frick, a former Liechtenstein prime minister, the referendum was approved by the electorate in 2003. Opponents accused Hans-Adam of engaging in emotional blackmail to achieve his goal and constitutional experts from the Council of Europe branded the event as a retrograde move.The Age 18 March 2003. Theage.com.au (18 March 2003). A proposal to revoke the prince's new veto powers was rejected by 76% of voters in a 2012 referendum. On 15 August 2004 Prince Hans-Adam II formally delegated most of his sovereign authority to his son and heir, the Hereditary Prince Alois, as a way of transitioning to a new generation.

B. S. Chandrasekhar is a former international cricketer who represented the Indian cricket team between 1964 and 1979. In cricket, a five-wicket haul refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and 40 bowlers have taken at least 15 five-wicket hauls at the international level as of . Chandrasekhar played as a leg spin bowler who formed a part of the Indian spin quartet. Described by West Indies cricketer Viv Richards as the \\"most difficult\\" bowler, Chandrasekhar took 16 five-wicket hauls during his international career. He developed an interest in the game when he was a child, watching the playing styles of Australian leg spinner Richie Benaud. Chandrasekhar was affected by polio at the age of five which weakened his right arm. He started as a left-arm bowler but gradually shifted to his withered right arm as it could offer more spin. Chandrasekhar made his Test debut in 1964 against England at the Brabourne Stadium, claiming four wickets for 67 runs in the first innings. His first five-wicket haul came against West Indies two years later at the same venue. Chandrasekhar's bowling figures of six wickets for 38 runs in 1971 were instrumental in setting up India's first victory in England. It was noted as the Indian \\"Bowling Performance of the Century\\" by Wisden in 2002. His bowling performances in the previous English season led to him being named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1972. His career-best figures for an innings were eight wickets for 79 runs against England at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground in December 1972. Chandrasekhar took a pair of five-wicket hauls for the only time in his career when he took 12 wickets for 104 runs against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground; the performance was effective in ensuring India's first victory in Australia. In Tests, he was most successful against England taking eight fifers. Chandrasekhar played his only One Day International in February 1976 against New Zealand in Eden Park. He claimed three wickets for 36 runs in the match that India lost by 80 runs. Key { |- ! Symbol !

S. Chandrasekhar"},{"id":"38575751","text":"Sniffing is a perceptually-relevant behavior, defined as the active sampling of odors through the nasal cavity for the purpose of information acquisition. This behavior, displayed by all terrestrial vertebrates, is typically identified based upon changes in respiratory frequency and/or amplitude, and is often studied in the context of odor guided behaviors and olfactory perceptual tasks. Sniffing is quantified by measuring intra-nasal pressure or flow or air or, while less accurate, through a strain gauge on the chest to measure total respiratory volume. Strategies for sniffing behavior vary depending upon the animal, with small animals (rats, mice, hamsters) displaying sniffing frequencies ranging from 4 to 12 Hz but larger animals (humans) sniffing at much lower frequencies, usually less than 2 Hz. Subserving sniffing behaviors, evidence for an \\"olfactomotor\\" circuit in the brain exists, wherein perception or expectation of an odor can trigger brain respiratory center to allow for the modulation of sniffing frequency and amplitude and thus acquisition of odor information. Sniffing is analogous to other stimulus sampling behaviors, including visual saccades, active touch, and whisker movements in small animals (viz., whisking). Atypical sniffing has been reported in cases of neurological disorders, especially those disorders characterized by impaired motor function and olfactory perception.  Background and history of sniffing = Background = The behavior of sniffing incorporates changes in air flow within the nose. This can involve changes in the depth of inhalation and the frequency of inhalations. Both of these entail modulations in the manner whereby air flows within the nasal cavity and through the nostrils. As a consequence, when the air being breathed is odorized, odors can enter and leave the nasal cavity with each sniff. The same applies regardless of what gas is being inhaled, including toxins and solvents, and other industrial chemicals which may be inhaled as a form of drug or substance abuse. The act of sniffing is considered distinct from respiration on several grounds. In humans, one can assess the occurrence of a sniff based upon volitional control of air movement through the nose. In these cases, human subjects can be asked to inhale for a certain amount of time, or in a particular pattern. Some animals are obligate nasal breathers, wherein the only air for respiration must arrive into the lungs via the nose. This includes rats and mice. Thus, in these animals the distinction between a breath and a sniff is not clear and could be argued to be indistinguishable. (See sniffing in small animals.) Sniffing is observed among all terrestrial vertebrates, wherein they inhale environmental air. Sniffing may also occur in underwater environments wherein an animal may exhale air from within its lungs and nasal cavity to acquire odors within an aquatic environment and then re- inhale this air. (See sniffing in small animals.) While sniffing behavior is often observed and discussed within the context of acquiring odor information, sniffing is also displayed during the performance of motivated behaviors and upon deep brain electrical stimulation of brain reward centers. For instance, prior to obtaining a food reward, mice and rabbits increase their sniffing frequency in a manner independent of seeking odor information. Sniffing behavior is also displayed by animals upon involuntary electrical stimulation of numerous brain structures. Thus, while sniffing is often considered a critical part of olfaction, its link with motivated and reward behaviors suggests it plays a role in other behaviors. = History = Studies into the perceptual correlates of sniffing on human olfaction did not reach the mainstream scientific community until the 1950s. Frank Jones, an American psychologist, published a paper demonstrating the interplay between parameters of sniffing and odor detection thresholds. He found that deep sniffs, consisting of a large volume of air, allowed for consistent and accurate detection of odors. One of the earliest reports of exploring sniffing in non- human animals was provided by Welker in his 1964 article, Analysis of sniffing in the albino rat. In this study, Welker used video recordings of rats during presentation with odors and other stimuli to explore the chest movements as an index of sniffing. This was the first paper to report that rats can sniff at frequencies reaching 12 Hz upon detection of odors and during free exploration. This paper also provided early evidence that the rhythm of sniffing was coupled with other sensory behaviors, such as whisking, or the movement of the whiskers. While behavioral and psycho-physical studies into sniffing and its influence on odor perception began to surface, much less work was being performed to explore the influence of sniffing behaviors on the physiological processing of odors within the brain. Early recordings from the olfactory bulbs of hedgehogs by Lord Edgar Adrian, who previously won the 1932 Nobel Prize along with Sir Charles Sherrington for their work on the functions of neurons, revealed that neural oscillations within the hedgehog olfactory bulb were entrained to the respiratory cycle. Further, odor-evoked oscillations (including an exhaled puff from a pipe), were amplified along with the respiratory cycle. These data gave evidence that information processing within the brain, particularly that of odors, was linked with respiration - establishing the integral nature of sniffing for the physiological processing of odors. About 20 years later, Max Mozell published a series of studies wherein he further proposed that the flow rate and the sorption properties of odorants interplay to affect the location of odorant binding to olfactory receptor neurons in the nose and consequentially odor input to the brain. Later, evidence that single neurons in the olfactory bulb, the brain's first relay station for odor information, are entrained with respiration was presented, establishing a solid basis for the control of odor input to the brain and the processing of odors by sniffing.  Methods for quantifying sniffing  There are multiple methods available for measuring sniffing. While these methods are applicable for most animal models (mice to humans), selection of appropriate sniff measurement methods should be determined by experimental need for precision. = Video = Perhaps the simplest method for determining the moment of sniffing is video-based. High resolution video of small animals (e.g., rats) during immobile respiration enables approximations of sniffing, including identification of individual sniff events. Similar methods can be employed to identify fast, high frequency sniffing during states of arousal and stimulus investigation. This method, however, does not provide direct evidence for sniffing and is not reliable in larger animals (rabbits to humans). = Chest strain = Sensors to measure chest expansion during inhalation provide direct information of sniff cycles. These methods include mechanical and optical devices. Mechanical devices for sniffing measurements are piezo foils placed under the chests of small animals and strain gauge around the chests of larger animals. In both cases, a positive increase in signal output (voltage) can be identified and used to index inhalation events. Alternatively, a photo transducer can be placed on the opposite side of an animal's chest from a light source (e.g., a Light- emitting diode). In this design, a decrease in signal reflects inhalation (chest expansion) as the chest would interrupt the light passage to the photo transducer. = Nasal microphone = As a direct measurement of sniffing, early studies favored the use of microphones placed/secured external to the anterior nares, the external openings of the nasal cavity. This method has advantages to directly index air leaving the nares (increase in microphone output), yet is mostly non-invasive. Due to this non-invasive nature of microphone measures, these methods have been employed in dogs during odor tracking exercises and are useful for measuring sniffing on a temporary basis in other large animals. = Nasal thermocouple and nasal pressure sensor = The most precise methods to date to measure sniffing involve direct intranasal measures through use of a temperature probe, called a thermocouple, or a pressure sensor. These can be inserted temporarily into the nares or implanted surgically. The basic principles of operation are shared between the temperature and pressure devices. Inhalation of ambient air provides cool temperature into the nasal cavity, whereas exhalation of inhaled air provides warm temperature into the nasal cavity and simultaneously an increase in intranasal pressure as air from the lungs is forced out of the nostrils. Placement of these sensors close to the olfactory epithelium of animals allows measures of odorized air transients as they reach the olfactory receptors and thus are common methods for measuring sniffing in the context of sensory neuroscience and psychological studies.  Sniffing in small animals  The earliest published study of sniffing behavior in small animals was performed in laboratory rats using video-based measures. In this study robust changes in respiratory frequency were reported to occur during exploration of an open arena and novel odors. Resting respiration occurs ~2 times/second (Hz), and increases to about 12 Hz are noted during states of exploration and arousal. Similar transitions in sniffing frequency are observed in freely exploring mice, which, however, maintain generally higher sniffing frequencies than rats (3 [rest] to 15 Hz [exploration] vs 2 to 12 Hz). Transitions in sniffing frequency are observed in animals performing odor-guided tasks. Studies of recording sniffing in the context of odor-guided tasks involve implanting intranasal temperature and pressure sensors into the nasal cavity of animals and either measuring odor-orienting responses (fast sniffing) or sniffing during performance in operant odor-guided tasks. Alternatively, animals can be conditioned to insert their snouts into an air-tight chamber with a pressure transducer embedded within to access nasal transients, while simultaneously odors are presented to measure responses while nose-poking. Notably, several studies have reported that modulation in sniffing frequency may be just as great in context of anticipation of odor sampling as during sampling of odors. Similar changes in sniffing frequency are even seen in animals presented with novel auditory stimuli, suggesting a relationship between sniffing and arousal. = Sniffing in semi-aquatic animals = While sniffing is generally thought to occur solely in terrestrial animals, semi-aquatic rodents (American water shrew) also display sniffing behaviors during underwater odor-guided tasks. Shrews inhale-exhale small amounts of air in a precise and coordinated fashion while tracking an underwater odor trail. This occurs through the inhalation of air above ground, to allow air to volatize odors in an environment otherwise void of air. = Sniffing and control of odor input to the brain = Measurements of sniffing simultaneously with physiological measures from olfactory centers in the brain have provided information on how sniffing modulates the access and processing of odors at the neural level. Inhalation is necessary for odor input to the brain. Further, odor input through the brain is temporally linked to the respiratory cycle, with bouts of activity occurring with each inhalation. This linkage between sniffing frequency and odor processing provides a mechanism for the control of odor input into the brain by respiratory frequency and possibly amplitude, though this is not well established.  Sniffing in humans  The nature of sniffing regulates odor perception in humans and in fact, in humans, a single sniff is often sufficient for optimal odor perception. For instance, a deep, steady inhalation of a faint odor allows a more potent percept than a shallow inhalation. Similarly, more frequent sniffs provide a faster percept of the odor environment than only sniffing once every 3 seconds. These examples have been supported by empirical studies (see above) and have provided insights into methods whereby humans may change their sniffing strategies to modulate odor perception. Odor inhalation evokes activity throughout olfactory structures in humans. Neuroimaging studies lack resolution to determine the impacts of sniffing frequency on the structure of odor input through the brain, although imaging studies have revealed that the motor act of sniffing is anatomically independent of sniff-evoked odor perception. Implications for this include the shared but distributed pathways for odor processing in the brain.  Neural control of sniffing  Sniffing is fundamentally controlled by respiratory centers in the brainstem, including the Pre-Botzinger complex which governs inhalation/exhalation patterns. Activity from respiratory brain stem structures then modulates nervous activity to control lung contraction. To exert changes to respiration, and thereby evoke sniffing behavior, volitional centers in the cerebral cortex must stimulate brain stem structures. It is through this simple pathway that the decision to inhale or sniff may occur. The rapid modulation of sniffing upon inhalation of a novel odor or an irritating odor is evidence for an \\"olfactomotor\\" loop in the brain. In this loop, novel odor-evoked sniffing behavior can occur rapidly upon perception of a novel odor, one of interest, or an odor which is aversive.  Relation of sniffing to other stimulus sampling behaviors  Sniffing, as an active sampling behavior, is often grouped along with other behaviors utilized to acquire sensory stimuli. For instance, sniffing has been compared to rapid eye movements, or saccades, in the ability for both methods to provide rapid \\"snapshots\\" of information to the brain. This analogy, though, may be imprecise since small animals (e.g., mice) make odor-based decisions (through sniffing) while also making visual decisions, yet do not saccade. Sniffing is also fundamentally similar to active touch, including swiping ones finger along a surface to scan texture. In part due to the interrelatedness of the respiratory brain stem structures with other central pattern generators responsible for governing some other active sampling behaviors, sniffing in animals often occurs at similar frequencies (2 to 12 Hz) and in a phasic relationship to the active sampling behaviors of whisking and licking. Whisking and sniffing are tightly correlated in their occurrence, with sniff inhalations occurring during whisker protraction. Due to the metabolic need to coordinate breathing and swallowing, small animals (rats and mice) often lick at similar frequencies of sniffing (4 to 8 Hz) and swallow in between inhalations or during brief periods of apnea (cessation of breathing).  Relevance to neurological disorders  Few studies have explored the impact of neurological disorders on sniffing behavior, although numerous neurological disorders affect respiration. Humans with Parkinson's disease have abnormal sniffing capabilities (i.e., reduced volume and flow rate) which may underlie olfactory perceptual impairments in the disease. Studies into sniffing in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and also humans have not found major effects of Alzheimer's pathology on both basal respiration and odor-evoked sniffing.

It is set in 1356, nearly a decade after the original trilogy, and culminates with the Battle of Poitiers. Intertwined in the plot is the quest to find La Malice, a fabled sword of Saint Peter and Christian relic which may turn the tide of the long war for France. It was first published in 2012. It is the fiftieth novel by Bernard Cornwell. Plot summary Thomas of Hookton prefers to be known as le b√¢tard, the leader of the Hellequin, his band of mercenaries fighting in France. He and Genevieve have a son Hugh, already in training to use a yew bow. Michael, a young monk from England, walking to Montpellier for schooling, carries a message from the Earl of Northampton for le b√¢tard, gaining his education in battle while waiting for the message to be accepted. Fra Ferdinand, a Black Friar, retrieves an old sword from a tomb. Returning to the friend who asked him to get it, Fra Ferdinand is set off to wander with it, as his friend was murdered by men who said the pope at Avignon sent them. The Hellequin followed them, disturbing the local graveyard. The \\"nonsense\\" of the mystical powers of the sword, said to be the one Saint Peter sheathed in Gethsemane, has swirled up again, pushing many to seek it, in hopes a sword alone will give them the power they seek.

In a racing career which lasted from June 1831 until April 1833 he ran ten times and won six races. He was one of the leading British two-year-olds of 1831, when his three wins included the Criterion Stakes at Newmarket and he was one of the favourites for the following year's British Classic Races. He finished fourth in The Derby, allegedly being held back to allow another of his owner's horses to win. In autumn he won the St Leger and the Grand Duke Michael Stakes but ran poorly on his only race as a four-year-old the following spring. He was then retired to stud where he had some success as a sire of winners in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Background Margrave was bred by Alexander Nowell at Underley Hall near Kirkby Lonsdale in Westmoreland where his sire Muley was based. Muley was a son of the Derby-winning mare Eleanor and won two races as a five-year-old at Newmarket in 1815. His early stud career was disappointing and he had been covering half-bred mares for some time before being bought by Nowell and relocated to Underley where he had considerable success. In addition to Margrave, he sired the Classic winners Little Wonder (Epsom Derby) and Vespa (Epsom Oaks). Margrave was a very dark-coated chestnut with no white markings. He was a large, powerful colt, standing 16 hands high, but not an attractive individual, being described as \\"a great, ugly horse... with lopping ears\\". As a three-year-old, he was trained by John Scott, who sent out the winners of 41 classics, from his Whitewall Stables at Malton in North Yorkshire. Racing career=1831: two-year-old season= Margrave racing career began at Stockbridge in Hampshire on 8 June 1831 when he raced in the colours of Mr Wreford. In a six furlong sweepstake he started 2/1 second favourite in a field of four and won by a length after \\"a good race\\" from Mr Sadler's filly Eleanor. After this race Margrave was sold and entered into the ownership of Mr Dilly. The colt did not run again until 24 August when he appeared for a half-mile sweepstakes at Winchester. He did not have to race for the prize, as his three opponents were withdrawn, allowing him to walk over. By late September, Margrave was being regarded as a potential winner of the following year's Derby, being offered at odds of 13/1. In October, Margrave was sent to Newmarket Racecourse where he contested the five furlong Clearwell Stakes, one of the season's most important races for two-year-olds. He started at odds of 7/1 against twelve opponents. He started very poorly but made ground in the closing stages and finished second by half a length to the favourite Emiliana, a filly owned and trained by William Chifney. At the Newmarket Houghton meeting two weeks later, Margrave was one of nine runners for the equally important Criterion Stakes. Ridden by George Edwards, he started the 2/1 favourite and won from Colonel Peel's colt Archibald, who went on to win the 2000 Guineas. =1832: three-year-old season= Before his first run in 1832, Margrave was bought for 2,500 guineas by John Gully a former champion prize-fighter who had built a second career as a professional gambler and bookmaker. Gully, in association with Robert Ridsdale, also owned a colt named St Giles, who had shown little ability as a two-year-old, but showed improved form in early 1832. From the time he was purchased by Gully, Margrave's odds for the Derby lengthened, while St Giles was heavily supported, leading to speculation that the result of the race being arranged to bring off a betting coup. On 7 June, having survived an objection from a Mr Wheeler who claimed that he was actually a four-year-old, Margrave started at odds of 7/1 for the Derby at Epsom Downs Racecourse in a field of 22 runners. The race was won by St Giles, the 3/1 favourite, with Margrave, who was not given a hard race by his jockey, finishing in fourth place. The Sporting Magazine's correspondent was convinced that Margrave (\\"by far the best horse in the race\\") had been deliberately held back to facilitate the success of his stable companion. Margrave did not run again until 18 September when he was sent to Doncaster Racecourse for the St Leger Stakes. Ridden by Jem Robinson, he was made the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting in a field of seventeen colts and fillies, his odds having lengthened in the week before the race after reports that he had injured a leg and was unlikely to take part. Robinson restrained the colt and he was not among the early leaders but began to make steady progress when the pace quickened in the straight. In the final furlong Margrave produced a strong late challenge on the outside to overtake the leader Birdcatcher (not to be confused with the similarly named Irish horse) and won by three quarters of a length. The Sporting Magazine criticised the very slow early pace and described Margrave as a \\"coarse, heavy looking horse\\", but admitted that he won the race very easily. Two days later, over the same course and distance, Margrave started at odds of 1/5 for the Gascoigne Stakes and won from his only opponent, a colt named Julius. Margrave ended his season with two runs at Newmarket's First October meeting, having walked the one hundred and thirty miles from Doncaster in less than two weeks. On the opening day of the meeting he won the Grand Duke Michael Stakes over ten furlongs, beating Lord Exeter's previously undefeated Oaks winner Galata. Two days later, Margrave started odd-on favourite for the Newmarket St Leger over the two-mile \\"Ditch-In\\". After a slow early pace, the race ended with a strongly contested sprint finish in which Margrave was beaten a head by the locally trained Archibald who had been rested for several weeks with the race as his objective. There was some criticism of Jem Robinson's tactics on the runner-up, as it was felt that he should have made use of Margrave's stamina by setting a stronger pace. At the Houghton meeting four weeks later, Margrave was withdrawn from a scheduled match race against the four-year-old filly Camarine, with Gully paying a ¬£150 forfeit. =1833: four-year-old season= Margrave reappeared as a four-year-old at the Newmarket Craven meeting in April. In the two mile Claret Stakes he had little support in the betting and finished last of the four runners behind the Duke of Cleveland's colt Trustee. Later in the month he had been scheduled to run a match race over Newmarket's Abington Mile against Lord Conyngham's horse Bassetlaw. As Bassetlaw had died some time before, Gully was able to claim a prize of ¬£200 without having to run his colt. Stud career After standing at Bishop Burton, near Beverley in Yorkshire for two seasons he was sold to Merritt & Company and exported to Virginia in 1835. He later stood in Tennessee before being sold to Major Gee and moved to Alabama where he died in 1852. During his brief British stud career Margrave sired several good winners, as well as an unnamed mare who produced the 2000 Guineas and St Leger winner Sir Tatton Sykes. In the United States he was never a popular stallion, but sired several successful runners including Blue Dick, Brown Dick and Doubloon, as well as several influential broodmares including the female-line ancestors of Tom Ochiltree, Aristides, Apollo, Stone Street, Peter McCue and Mata Hari. Pedigree * Margrave was inbred 4 x 4 to King Herod, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Early life Becks was born in Montreal, but lived in New York City in the first four years of his life. He is French Canadian on his father's side and American on his mother's side. His parents are both artists, which is why they've supported his desire to be a musician since the beginning. In an interview during one of his visits to Kiev he told the story of, \\"When I was 5 years old, I was obsessed with The Beatles. I made myself a cardboard guitar, sat everyone around and pretended that I was one of The Beatles. I had my first real guitar at the age of 7. I sang and played, and I never stopped\\",. At 8 years old, besides the guitar, he already played bass, drums and the piano. As a teenager, Becksne played in many garage bands but he left them eventually. Being a fan of raves, he used things like Nintendo gloves and pants from the bubble polyethylen, and went to the clubs, whose music he always felt in his heart.Interview for Rolling Stone Russia Career=Acting= At 12 years old Becks started on a Canadian TV series called Le Retour and a teen drama called ZAP and a cameo appearance in the Canadian court show Les grands proc√®s. At the age of 20 after he got his first record deal with Vandit records, Antoine gave up acting to focus on his electronic live act Second Sun. =Second Sun= Adam White (L) & Antoine Becks (R) as the live act Second sun In early 2000, Becks met Adam White, who worked at a music store at the time. \\"I came in the store to buy something and it all ended up with me asking Adam to join me\\", he recalls. They later became known as Second Sun. Antoine was new to producing electronic dance music so it was a learning process, but after six months of trying to create his first track, Antoine gave a CD to Paul Van Dyk, asking him what he thought about it. A week later, Paul offered to sign Second Sun to Vandit Records and they took the chance. From then on, the requests for Second Sun shows went off the scale..Antoine Becks Rocks Loss Angeless Their debut album Inside Out was expected to be trance, but the duet surprised everyone with a variety of sounds and acoustic instruments. \\"We love the airy feeling of trance music, but at the same time we wanted to be more varied and incorporate proper songs, not just dancefloor bangers. At the time it was rare to hear a rock-driven male vocal on a dance track\\", said Antoine, and it was ultimately reflected in their single \\"Doing It Well\\" with Paul Harris of Dirty Vegas. Second Sun also collaborated with Paul Van Dyk on the hit single \\"Crush\\", which was on Paul Van Dyk's Grammy-nominated album Reflections. Second Sun also collaborated with Grammy-winner Cedric Gervais on a number of house singles (including a remix of Queen's \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" (appearing as \\"The Miami Project\\") and Antoine's voice was featured on Sharam's hit single \\"P.A.T.T.

They met at a party in Miami at the end of 2009. In spring 2010, Shannon mentioned CB7 for the first time in an interview: . Together with his cousin and drummer Matt Becks, bass player Noah Luger and guitarist Adam White, who was also a member of Second Sun, the band released four demo-tracks and toured as the opening band for Thirty Seconds to Mars in the North American leg of their \\"Closer to the Edge\\" tour. In January 2011, Becks announced that the current group members were his cousin Matt and himself. Later Chelsea Davis, Frankie Sizr and Jamie Reed joined the group, after meeting them in L.A. and Montreal through friends, as live members. Chelsea has her own band called Annabelle vs the Villain and Jamie is a friend of Jared Leto, Shannon's younger brother and singer of Thirty Seconds to Mars. After Shannon and Antoine broke up their live act, Shannon said via Twitter he will no longer manage CB7. On March 15, 2014 Antoine stated he will no longer pursue working on CB7 due to him working on his own solo music.

He is the son of former Lakers owner Jerry Buss. Buss was president of the Los Angeles Lazers professional indoor soccer team from 1985‚Äì1989. He later trained thoroughbred race horses for nine years before joining the Lakers in 1998 as an assistant general manager. He was promoted to vice president of basketball operations in 2005. After his father Jerry died in 2013, his controlling ownership of the Lakers passed to his children via a family trust, with each child receiving an equal interest. Early life Buss was born the second of four children to Jo Ann and Jerry Buss. He grew up with older brother Johnny and sisters Jeanie and Janie. Their parents divorced in 1972. Buss attended college at University of Southern California (USC), majoring in math before he dropped out. He spent much of his youth at race tracks. Although he stood , Buss attended jockey school when he was 20. Professional career Buss invested in a small business with his best friend, but the friend died in a car accident in 1981. The death left Buss devastated and lost, and the business was left to fade. In 1985, Buss became president of his father's indoor soccer team, the Los Angeles Lazers, after his brother Johnny had quit. Buss brought annual losses down from $1 million to $500,000, but the team folded in 1989. He next became a horse trainer, receiving from his father the half-dozen thoroughbreds he owned. In 1997, Jerry divested himself of his horse racing stock that was increasingly unprofitable. Shortly after, he invited his son to join the Lakers, a basketball team he acquired in 1979 and built into one of the most lucrative and popular franchises in all of sports. Buss started with the Lakers in 1998 as an apprentice to general manager Jerry West and his assistant, Mitch Kupchak. During an interview with Sports Illustrated for its November 1998 issue, Jim shared his thoughts on scouting, saying: \\"Evaluating basketball talent is not too difficult. If you grabbed 10 fans out of a bar and asked them to rate prospects, their opinions would be pretty much identical to those of the pro scouts.\\" He later said he was trying to compliment Lakers scouts, who faced a challenge with the team usually picking late in the NBA Draft compared to the consensus that he believed existed with lottery picks, but the quote became controversial nevertheless. Buss continued to learn the basketball business from his father as well as West and then Kupchak, who was promoted to general manager in 2000. After the Lakers lost in the 2004 NBA Finals, Buss decided that the Lakers would sign Rudy Tomjanovich to replace the outgoing Phil Jackson. That summer, Tomjanovich was signed to a five-year, $30 million contract. Tomjanovich resigned after a half season, citing mental and physical exhaustion. The Lakers paid him a $10 million settlement, leading to speculation that the Lakers had instead terminated his contract. In 2005, Buss was promoted to vice president of player personnel. His father's plan was to have Buss handle the basketball decisions for the team, while his sister Jeanie, the vice president of business operations, handled the business side of the Lakers. Buss persuaded the Lakers to draft Andrew Bynum. In the 2005 draft, Buss was a key proponent of selecting 17-year old high school center Andrew Bynum, a decision that his father needed to approve. Buss said, \\"I just absolutely fell in love with [Bynum] in five minutes [watching his workout].\\" He was also involved in rehiring Jackson as Lakers coach. Buss was the only family member present at Jackson's welcome-back news conference, which the Los Angeles Daily News wrote \\"was viewed as significant\\". Buss stuck with Bynum as he struggled with immaturity and injuries, and he withstood demands from Bryant that Bynum be traded. After Jackson retired in 2011, Buss explicitly told coaching candidates Brian Shaw and Mike Brown that Bynum needed to receive the ball inside. Shaw was passed over as Jackson's replacement although the Lakers assistant was openly supported by players. Buss instead hired Brown without consulting their star player, Kobe Bryant. He later said it was a mistake to not involve Bryant. Shaw was not bitter that the Lakers went with Brown, but he was disappointed that after 12 years of service, they did not contact him until three weeks after their decision. The well-respected Shaw atypically criticized Buss in a radio interview over his treatment during the hiring cycle. The offseason also included the NBA player lockout, during which the Lakers let go of nearly two dozen employees with a combined 100 years of experience from the basketball operations staff. Assistant General Manager Ronnie Lester, whose contract was not renewed after 24 years with the team, said \\"great organizations don't treat their personnel like they've done.\\" CBSSports.com wrote that NBA executives are typically discreet, and Lester's public criticism \\"shows how strongly he feels the Lakers were in the wrong here\\". Buss feared the season would be cancelled, and said that \\"we had to do what we had to do. It‚Äôs not fun; there‚Äôs no question about that.\\" The lockout ended in the winter of 2011. Prior to the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Buss had a deal in place to acquire Chris Paul from the New Orleans Hornets for Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom, but NBA commissioner David Stern blocked the trade. That season, Brown expanded Bynum's role. The next season, the Lakers acquired Steve Nash and upgraded at center, trading Bynum for Dwight Howard. The acquisition of Howard appeared to be the start of a new dynasty for the Lakers. With their $100 million payroll, the Lakers were expected to be title contenders. Instead, Brown was fired after a 1‚Äì4 start; his dismissal after five games was the third-fastest coaching change in NBA history. In a unanimous decision by Buss, his father, and Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers decided against re-hiring Jackson and signed Mike D'Antoni instead. According to NBA.com, Jerry by that time was no longer involved in the Lakers' day-to-day affairs, and rarely exercised his veto powers. Buss, however, said his father continued to be \\"involved in every decision\\" in the final months of his life, and he chose D'Antoni. After being passed over in favor of Brown in 2011, Shaw said he was informed by Jerry that \\"his son is in control now, and he has to let him make whatever decisions that he makes.\\" The 2012‚Äì13 season ended up being a disappointment, with Buss saying \\"we didn't get to realize the dream of four Hall of Famers on the same team.\\" After Jerry Buss died in 2013, his 66% controlling ownership of the Lakers passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote. Jerry's succession plan had Jeanie assume his previous title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings. After the season, the Lakers were unable to re-sign the free agent Howard, who joined the Houston Rockets while accepting $30 million less than the Lakers offer. Sister Jeanie commented that she \\"would be more comfortable [with her business relationship with Buss] if I understood what the [basketball] decision process was, and I‚Äôm not always involved in it.\\" In 2013‚Äì14, Jeanie became Lakers president, and her role included overseeing the team's basketball operations while working with Buss, who continued as Lakers executive VP of basketball operations. Former Lakers player and part owner Magic Johnson, who was also close to Buss' father, believed that Buss needed to put aside his ego and seek assistance to help the Lakers recruit against rival teams for free agent players. That season, Buss signed Bryant to a two-year extension worth $48.5 million, even before Bryant had recovered from an Achilles tendon tear. The Los Angeles Times called the deal \\"one of many terrible Lakers moves\\" that year. In January 2014, Buss pledged to his siblings that he would step down if the Lakers were not contending for the Western Conference championship in three to four years. According to Jeanie, she was holding him to his self-imposed deadline, and was expecting him to lead the Lakers to at least the second round of the playoffs by 2016‚Äì17. On February 21, 2017, Buss was fired as head of basketball operations of the Lakers, though he would continue to be a part owner of the team. After a dispute with Jeanie over ownership of the team, Buss was removed as a trustee of the Buss family trust and lost his position on the Lakers board of directors. Public image Buss is introverted and avoids the spotlight, and has never joined any on-court public ceremony for the Lakers. He rarely spoke in public as a Lakers executive, while general manager Mitch Kupchak usually handled the speaking responsibilities regarding player personnel. Buss is sometimes portrayed in the Los Angeles media as a slacker with his father's tastes but without his business savvy. In 2013, Buss said the playboy image stemmed from his clubbing with his dad 30 years earlier, but stated that he became a \\"stay-at-home guy. That's where I like to work.\\" Public perception is that Buss was instrumental in distancing the team from Jackson, including discounting his assistant Shaw from succeeding him as Lakers head coach. During his interview for the position, Shaw said he had to defend Jackson when Buss spoke negatively of their former coach. In a May 2011 interview, Jackson said \\"there's really not a relationship\\" with him and Buss. However, Buss in 2013 denied the perception of his relationship with Jackson. \\"I have zero problem with Phil, and Phil has zero problem with me.\\" Buss said he would be fine if Jackson, who is engaged to Buss' sister Jeanie, was on the Lakers' payroll, but only as a consultant. According to Jeanie, Jackson served as an unofficial consultant: \\"Phil is a part of the organization because of me ... Jim and Mitch know Phil is a phone call away.\\" Kupchak confirmed that he had interacted with Jackson on unspecified team issues. However, Jackson did not envision a role on the team unless there was \\"some seismic shift\\" in the organization. Jeanie also said the Lakers were \\"in good hands\\" with Buss and Kupchak in their current roles. The Orange County Register, though, wrote that \\"many fans would love to imagine\\" Jackson returning to the Lakers to replace Buss as the leader of basketball operations, and teaming with Jeanie to build a championship team. In 2014, public pressure mounted on the Buss family to hire Jackson, as he was discussing a front office position with the New York Knicks. However, the Lakers did not have a suitable front office role to offer him, and Jackson joined the Knicks as their president of basketball operations. Personal life Buss married in 1983, and the couple adopted a son, Jager. Buss and his wife separated months later, but continued living together for six months while a social worker was monitoring the adoption. They divorced in late 1985 with Buss gaining sole custody of their son.

It is located in the Wensleydale hamlet of Gayle, England, south of the market town of Hawes. It lies within the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The mill is owned by the North of England Civic Trust (NECT); it has been operated by a local volunteer group, the Gayle Mill Trust, which paid a modest rent to the owner. The property was closed in March 2018 because major repairs were required to make it safe. History The Grade II* listed mill was built by local hosiers and land owners Oswald and Thomas Routh as a water- powered cotton mill, and was powered by a diameter overshot waterwheel. It was turned over to flax and wool spinning by 1813 for the local knitting industry. For a period in the 19th century, it was used for domestic accommodation. It was converted to a sawmill around 1879. The waterwheel was removed and replaced with a Thomson double-vortex turbine, built by Williamsons (now Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon Ltd) of Kendal. This is thought to be the only remaining working variety of its type. In its heydey, the 10 hp (7.46 kW) created by the turbine drove a range of woodworking machinery ‚Äì a rack sawbench, circular saw, thicknesser (planer), and lathes ‚Äì by a series of belts and pulleys off a central line shaft. In 1919, part of the mill was hired to provide electricity to the area using turbines for the generator.http://www.gaylemill.org.uk/our-heritage The mill provided electricity for the village until 1948. Restoration and current status Gayle Mill closed in 1988, after over a century of operation as a sawmill, and it seemed likely it would be converted into luxury flats. In 2004 its plight came to national attention when it featured in the second series of BBC2's Restoration programme. It won the regional heat and came in the top three in the national finals. Restoration of the mill started in the same year and works to bring the site to operational standard took four years and cost over ¬£1 million. Funding for the renovation came from several sources including the Heritage Lottery Fund, English Heritage and Yorkshire Forward. Gayle Mill re- opened to the public in 2008. Restorations host Griff Rhys Jones returned to Gayle Mill in 2009 to film an update on the restoration work. In 2012 Gayle Mill was featured on Channel 4's How Britain Worked, presented by Guy Martin. The mill was open for tours and heritage skills training courses, with fully restored machines and turbines being demonstrated by the Gayle Mill Trust. The Gayle Mill Trust was advised by NECT in early 2018 that the mill would need to be closed for repairs. NECT would need to remedy problems, including some that were created during the restoration, in order to ensure safety and to comply with insurance regulations. The site was vacated on 31 March 2018. The Gayle Mill Trust was hoping that the work could be completed in time to reopen it at Easter 2019. NECT told the news media that it did intend to repair the mill, contrary to rumours that other uses were being considered for the property. Fund raising was under way in summer 2018. The timber and woodworking services division of the mill continued to operate from another site using wood that had been previously processed.

It consists of a complex including walls with entrances, small mosques and funerary monuments. The mausoleum, located inside the mosque, bears the grave of one of the sons of Imam Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam of Shi'a Muslims.  History  The mausoleum The construction of the Imamzadeh Mausoleum in the city of Ganja in Azerbaijan was implemented in the 8th century. According to the inscription found inside of the mausoleum, the sons of Mohammad al-Baqir, who is considered one of the most sacred personalities of Shiite Islam, left their motherland and moved to Azerbaijan and ƒ∞ran in order to escape from the ruling circles of the Umayyad Caliphate (661-750), who carried out the persecution against the representatives of the Prophet of Islam. ƒ∞mam Ibrahim and Ismail came to the cities of Azerbaijan - Barda and Ganja, but here they were killed by their enemies. Mausoleums were erected on the graves of Imam Ismail in Barda, and Imam Ibrahim in Ganja. The inscription is composed of a small marble plaque on the first floor of the Imamzadeh Tomb. In the middle ages, restoration and reconstruction work was carried out in the territory of the Imamzadeh Mausoleum. In the 15th and 16th centuries, as a result of the strengthening of the Shiite, special attention was paid to the construction of large structures, the use of religious attributes, as well as new craftsmanship in the repair and restoration of the mausoleum. Basic information on the restoration of Ganja's ancient monuments, historical buildings, and religious sites dates back to the 18th-19th centuries. This is due to the fact that the restoration work is carried out at the official level, directly by the privileged persons. During the reign of Javad Khan (1786-1804), major renovations were carried out in the mausoleum and the palace architects Karbalai Sadiq led the work. Between 1878 and 1879, Nizami Ganjavi mausoleum and Imamzadeh complex were again reconstructed by the chief of the Second Muslim Riders Regiment of the Tsar Russian Army Major-General Israfil bey Yadigarzadeh. Imamzadeh in Ganja In 2010-2016, major reconstruction and restoration works were carried out in the Imamzadeh complex, as well as on the Ganja-Zazali road laying to the complex. Totally 31 million manats for restoration of Imamzadeh Mausoleum and 17 million manats for road reconstruction have been sent. 10,000 square meters of asphalt cover was laid on the territory of the complex, decorated with ornamental stones, lighting system was installed, infrastructure was created. There are 2 minarets, namazgah (place for prayer) and visitor hall with a height of 42 meters, as well as 2 parking for 500 cars in the area. The first floor of the three-storey main building of the mausoleum is used as a wardrobe. The second floor consists of administrative rooms and the third floor is used as a hotel.  Architectural features  Imamzadeh was originally a grave in early middle ages. Then the grave gradually turned into a large complex as a result of construction a mausoleum on it. Regarding with the increased importance of the mausoleum as a sanctuary, new craftsmanship and architectural elements were added. The mausoleum is the major monument of the complex. This mausoleum shows how many mausoleums acquired cultic architectural features, losing their features of memorial monuments in the 16th-19th centuries. The mausoleum belongs to tower-cupola types of buildings. A two-storeyed arch shaped the extension of the mausoleum, surrounding the central kernel from three sides, with a portal from the eastern part. This arch dates from the 17th century. A margin of lancet arches with rectangular frames is a peculiar feature of the extension. The mausoleum is built of square bricks. Inside the mausoleum there is a zarih. The main parts of the complex are the tomb building and cemetery. Besides, seven domes, mosque, caravanserai houses, the dome on the entrance gate to the monument (ninth dome), ornaments and inscriptions on the gravestones, pool and other auxiliary buildings along with the main tomb dome, shapes the architectural structure of Imamzadeh mausoleum. A large and tall mosque building with 3 minarets was built over the Imamzadeh tomb. The central dome of the mosque is decorated with floral elements and decorated with symbolic characteristic peacock drawings. The central dome differs significantly from others in terms of its structure and dimensions. Its height is 14.7 meters. From the point of view of architectures, this dome is distinguished by its elegant design features. The central dome, which is called ‚ÄúImam Ibrahim dome‚Äù, is in the shape of ancient helmet (t…ôskul…ô). The diameter of the dome is 4,4 meters. Imam Ibrahim dome The mausoleum was constructed using red bricks and features specific to the Arran Architectural School were used. Small dome cells on the right and left sides of the central dome are later added to the monument in the 13th-16th centuries. The most prominent part of the Imamzadeh tomb in terms of appearance is the dome and its cylindrical body decorated with colorful blue and green tiles. In the decorating of facades, mainly blue tiles have been used. The baklava-shaped and other figure ornaments are dark purple. At the same time, it is also possible to find individual greenish tiles. These decorative elements have been added to the monuments in the XIV-XVII centuries. The first floor of the southeastern fa√ßade consists of three arches.  Research  The first researches on Imamzadeh Mausoleum located in Ganja city of Azerbaijan were carried out by L. S. Bretanitski and the author's book \\"Azerbaijan Architecture\\" (1952) contains some information about ancient monument in Ganja. However, the investigator considers the Imamzadeh Mausoleum as a XVIII century monument by mistake (without reading the inscriptions in the mausoleum). For the first time researcher-architect Niyazi Rzayev in his article titled \\"Ganja Imamzadeh Mausoleum\\" not only provides architectural and artistic features of the monument, but also gives detailed information about its history. In 1947 N. Rzayev began researches from the scientific point of view of Imamzadeh Mausoleum. After ten years, in 1957 his article was published in the second volume of the collection of the Azerbaijan History Museum. One of the scientific sources reflecting the history of the Ganja Imamzadeh is the monograph \\"History of Azerbaijani Architecture\\" published in 1963 in Russian. In this book, published by M.Huseynov, L.Bretanitski, and A.Salamzadeh, more general information has been given about the Ganja Imamzade. In A. Salamzade's monograph \\"Architecture of Azerbaijan (XVI-XIX centuries)\\", published in Baku in 1964, the architectural features of the monument are thoroughly explored. Archeologist Isaac Jafarzadeh\`s researches, who carried out archeological investigations for many years in ancient Ganja territory and published the results under the name \\"Ancient Ganja's historical-archeological essay\\" in 1949 in Baku, is one of the important sources for studying the history of the Imamzadeh mausoelum. The series of scientific works by Meshadykhanim Nemet in terms of detailed investigation of the history of the Ganja Imamzadeh are also important. Her works \\"Sacred places in Baku\\" (Baku, 1992) and \\"Epigraphic Monuments in Ganja\\" (Baku, 1991) illustrate the history and some aspects of the Imamzadeh Mausoleum.

It was the primary microarchitecture used in the GeForce 400 series and GeForce 500 series. It was followed by Kepler, and used alongside Kepler in the GeForce 600 series, GeForce 700 series, and GeForce 800 series, in the latter two only in mobile GPUs. In the workstation market, Fermi found use in the Quadro x000 series, Quadro NVS models, as well as in Nvidia Tesla computing modules. All desktop Fermi GPUs were manufactured in 40 nm, mobile Fermi GPUs in 40 nm and 28 nm. Fermi is the oldest microarchitecture from NVIDIA that received support for the Microsoft's rendering API Direct3D 12 feature_level 11. The architecture is named after Enrico Fermi, an Italian physicist.  Overview  Fig. 1. NVIDIA Fermi architecture Convention in figures: orange - scheduling and dispatch; green - execution; light blue -registers and caches. Fermi Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) feature 3.0 billion transistors and a schematic is sketched in Fig. 1. *Streaming Multiprocessor (SM): composed of 32 CUDA cores (see Streaming Multiprocessor and CUDA core sections). *GigaThread global scheduler: distributes thread blocks to SM thread schedulers and manages the context switches between threads during execution (see Warp Scheduling section). *Host interface: connects the GPU to the CPU via a PCI-Express v2 bus (peak transfer rate of 8GB/s). *DRAM: supported up to 6GB of GDDR5 DRAM memory thanks to the 64-bit addressing capability (see Memory Architecture section). *Clock frequency: 1.5 GHz (not released by NVIDIA, but estimated by Insight 64). *Peak performance: 1.5 TFlops. *Global memory clock: 2 GHz. *DRAM bandwidth: 192GB/s.  Streaming multiprocessor  Each SM features 32 single-precision CUDA cores, 16 load/store units, four Special Function Units (SFUs), a 64KB block of high speed on-chip memory (see L1+Shared Memory subsection) and an interface to the L2 cache (see L2 Cache subsection). =Load/Store Units= Allow source and destination addresses to be calculated for 16 threads per clock. Load and store the data from/to cache or DRAM. =Special Functions Units (SFUs)= Execute transcendental instructions such as sin, cosine, reciprocal, and square root. Each SFU executes one instruction per thread, per clock; a warp executes over eight clocks. The SFU pipeline is decoupled from the dispatch unit, allowing the dispatch unit to issue to other execution units while the SFU is occupied.  CUDA core  Integer Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Supports full 32-bit precision for all instructions, consistent with standard programming language requirements. It is also optimized to efficiently support 64-bit and extended precision operations. =Floating Point Unit (FPU)= Implements the new IEEE 754-2008 floating-point standard, providing the fused multiply-add (FMA) instruction for both single and double precision arithmetic. Up to 16 double precision fused multiply-add operations can be performed per SM, per clock.  Polymorph-Engine  Fused multiply- add  Fused multiply-add (FMA) perform multiplication and addition (i.e., A*B+C) with a single final rounding step, with no loss of precision in the addition. FMA is more accurate than performing the operations separately.  Warp scheduling  The Fermi architecture uses a two-level, distributed thread scheduler. Each SM can issue instructions consuming any two of the four green execution columns shown in the schematic Fig. 1. For example, the SM can mix 16 operations from the 16 first column cores with 16 operations from the 16 second column cores, or 16 operations from the load/store units with four from SFUs, or any other combinations the program specifies. Note that 64-bit floating point operations consumes both the first two execution columns. This implies that an SM can issue up to 32 single-precision (32-bit) floating point operations or 16 double-precision (64-bit) floating point operations at a time. =GigaThread Engine= The GigaThread engine schedules thread blocks to various SMs =Dual Warp Scheduler= At the SM level, each warp scheduler distributes warps of 32 threads to its execution units. Threads are scheduled in groups of 32 threads called warps. Each SM features two warp schedulers and two instruction dispatch units, allowing two warps to be issued and executed concurrently. The dual warp scheduler selects two warps, and issues one instruction from each warp to a group of 16 cores, 16 load/store units, or 4 SFUs. Most instructions can be dual issued; two integer instructions, two floating instructions, or a mix of integer, floating point, load, store, and SFU instructions can be issued concurrently. Double precision instructions do not support dual dispatch with any other operation.  Performance  The theoretical single-precision processing power of a Fermi GPU in GFLOPS is computed as 2 (operations per FMA instruction per CUDA core per cycle) √ó number of CUDA cores √ó shader clock speed (in GHz). Note that the previous generation Tesla could dual-issue MAD+MUL to CUDA cores and SFUs in parallel, but Fermi lost this ability as it can only issue 32 instructions per cycle per SM which keeps just its 32 CUDA cores fully utilized. Therefore, it is not possible to leverage the SFUs to reach more than 2 operations per CUDA core per cycle. The theoretical double-precision processing power of a Fermi GPU is 1/2 of the single precision performance on GF100/110. However, in practice this double-precision power is only available on professional Quadro and Tesla cards, while consumer GeForce cards are capped to 1/8.  Memory  L1 cache per SM and unified L2 cache that services all operations (load, store and texture). =Registers= Each SM has 32K of 32-bit registers. Each thread has access to its own registers and not those of other threads. The maximum number of registers that can be used by a CUDA kernel is 63. The number of available registers degrades gracefully from 63 to 21 as the workload (and hence resource requirements) increases by number of threads. Registers have a very high bandwidth: about 8,000 GB/s. =L1+Shared Memory= On-chip memory that can be used either to cache data for individual threads (register spilling/L1 cache) and/or to share data among several threads (shared memory). This 64 KB memory can be configured as either 48 KB of shared memory with 16 KB of L1 cache, or 16 KB of shared memory with 48 KB of L1 cache. Shared memory enables threads within the same thread block to cooperate, facilitates extensive reuse of on-chip data, and greatly reduces off-chip traffic. Shared memory is accessible by the threads in the same thread block. It provides low-latency access (10-20 cycles) and very high bandwidth (1,600 GB/s) to moderate amounts of data (such as intermediate results in a series of calculations, one row or column of data for matrix operations, a line of video, etc.). David Patterson says that this Shared Memory uses idea of local scratchpad =Local Memory= Local memory is meant as a memory location used to hold \\"spilled\\" registers. Register spilling occurs when a thread block requires more register storage than is available on an SM. Local memory is used only for some automatic variables (which are declared in the device code without any of the __device__, __shared__, or __constant__ qualifiers). Generally, an automatic variable resides in a register except for the following: (1) Arrays that the compiler cannot determine are indexed with constant quantities; (2) Large structures or arrays that would consume too much register space; Any variable the compiler decides to spill to local memory when a kernel uses more registers than are available on the SM. =L2 Cache= 768 KB unified L2 cache, shared among the 16 SMs, that services all load and store from/to global memory, including copies to/from CPU host, and also texture requests. The L2 cache subsystem also implements atomic operations, used for managing access to data that must be shared across thread blocks or even kernels. =Global memory= Accessible by all threads as well as host (CPU). High latency (400-800 cycles).  Video decompression/compression  See Nvidia NVDEC (formerly called NVCUVID) as well as Nvidia PureVideo and Nvidia NVENC.

Judge From 1687 onward a determined effort was made by the English Crown to replace Protestant judges with Catholics, and O'Neill was appointed a judge largely on account of his religion: Ball noted that he had only about fifteen years practice at the Bar.Ball p.304 He became a justice of assize in Ulster in 1687 and the following year was appointed justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). He served for barely a year before the Glorious Revolution; but no action seems to have been taken against him. He was acting as a judge of assize in 1689 and 1690.Ball p.394 He probably died in 1694Betham p.9 (Ball gives the date as 1697) and was buried in his wife's family vault at Dunsany Castle. His son Henry succeeded as 3rd Baronet; he also had a daughter Elinor, who married Edward Evers. The title became dormant in 1799. Reputation All of James II's Catholic judges were subjected to much criticism during and especially after their brief careers on the Bench, being accused of a lack of legal knowledge and integrity.Ball p.306 In particular the Jacobite writer Thomas Sheridan described them all as creatures of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell: \\"poor, indigent and scandalously ignorant of the law\\".Ball p.305 In judging this assessment of O'Neill, allowance must be made for Sheridan's deep hatred of his former employer Tyrconnell, which no doubt extended to those whom Tyrconnell favoured. Elrington Ball by contrast notes that most of these men, including O'Neill, survived the Revolution with their reputations and estates intact.Ball pp.306-7 References Baronets in the Baronetage of Ireland Members of Gray's Inn 1694 deaths People from County Down Irish Roman Catholics Year of birth missing Justices of the Irish King's Bench ","title":"Sir Brian O'Neill, 2nd Baronet"},{"id":"38576484","text":"Muir, Wood and Company was the premier Scottish piano manufacturer in the early 19th century. History In 1798, after the failure of his brother's retail music business, John Muir took over management of the firm and entered into a partnership with Andrew Wood to form the piano manufacturing and music publishing firm of Muir, Wood and Company. In 1799 the company won a royal warrant as the \\"Musical Instrument Makers of His Majesty.\\" The firm at this time was located at 16 George Street in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1804, George Small joined the firm to run the retail end of the business. The company also relocated at this time to 7 Leith Street in Edinburgh, with that location being renumbered to 13 Leith Street in 1811. The firm's manufacturing facility was located at Calton Hill. In addition to pianos, the firm made organs (church, chamber and barrel), harps, violins, cellos, tambourines, triangles, drums and serpents. The firm continued until John Muir's death in 1818. Andrew Wood and George Small continued in business, but on a reduced scale, under the name Wood, Small and Company, until Andrew Wood's death in 1829. In 1822, the firm moved to Waterloo Place, Edinburgh. Successive companies were Wood and Company, J. Muir Wood and Company, and Small, Bruce and Company.

Its administration is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Judicial Council, the Committee on District Courts, the Judicial Conferences, the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission, and various other offices and officers.  Courts = Supreme Court = Richmond. The Supreme Court of Virginia is the highest court in the Commonwealth of Virginia and is made up of seven justices. It primarily hears appeals from the trial- level city and county Circuit Courts. Although the Supreme Court of Virginia possesses both original and appellate jurisdiction, its primary function is to review decisions of lower courts, including the Court of Appeals, from which appeals have been allowed. Virginia does not allow an appeal to the Supreme Court as a matter of right except in cases involving the State Corporation Commission, attorney disciplinary actions including the disbarment of an attorney, and review of the death penalty. The court's original jurisdiction is limited to cases of habeas corpus (ordering one holding custody to produce the detained person before the court for the purpose of determining whether such custody is proper), mandamus (ordering the holder of an office to perform his duty), prohibition (ordering an action stopped in a lower court), and writs of actual innocence pursuant to Virginia's Code ¬ß 19.2‚Äì327.2. It also has original jurisdiction for challenges to decisions of the State Corporation Commission pursuant to Article IX of the Constitution of Virginia. The Supreme Court also has original jurisdiction in matters filed by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission relating to judicial censure, retirement, and removal of judges. = Court of Appeals = The Court of Appeals of Virginia hears appeals from decisions of Virginia's circuit courts and the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission. It is composed of eleven judges, and sits in panels of at least three judges, and sometimes hears cases en banc. Appeals from the Court of Appeals go to the Supreme Court of Virginia. The Court of Appeals has authority to hear appeals as a matter of right from: * any final judgment, order, or decree of a circuit court involving affirmance or annulment of a marriage, divorce, custody, spousal or child support, or control or disposition of a child, as well as other domestic relations cases; * any final decision of the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission (a state agency responsible for handling workers' compensation claims); * any final decision of a circuit court on appeal from a decision of an administrative agency (example: the Department of Health); and * any interlocutory order granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction or adjudicating the principles of a cause in any of the cases listed above. The Court of Appeals has authority to consider petitions for appeal from: * final orders of conviction in criminal and traffic matters except where a death penalty is imposed; * final decisions of a circuit court on an application for a concealed weapons permit; and * certain preliminary rulings in felony cases when requested by the Commonwealth. The Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibition and habeas corpus in any case over which the Court would have appellate jurisdiction. In addition, the Court of Appeals has original jurisdiction to issue a writ of actual innocence upon petition of a person who has been convicted of a felony upon a plea of not guilty. = Circuit Courts = The Virginia Circuit Courts are the state trial courts of general jurisdiction. The state has 120 Circuit Courts divided among 31 judicial circuits. The Circuit Courts have jurisdiction to hear civil and criminal cases. For civil cases, the courts have authority to try cases with an amount in controversy of more than $4,500 and have exclusive original jurisdiction over claims for more than $25,000. In criminal matters, the Circuit Courts are the trial courts for all felony charges and for misdemeanors originally charged there. The Circuit Courts also have appellate jurisdiction for any case from the Virginia General District Courts (the trial courts of limited jurisdiction in Virginia) claiming more than $50, which are tried de novo in the Circuit Courts. = District Courts = The Virginia General District Court (GDC) is the lowest level of the Virginia court system, and is the court that most Virginians have contact with. There are 32 General District Court districts, each having at least one judge. The jurisdiction of the GDC is generally limited to traffic cases and other misdemeanors, civil cases involving amounts of under $25,000. The GDCs are not courts of record, meaning that they do not keep detailed records of their proceedings and their decisions provide no precedent to be cited in other proceedings. Proceedings before the GDC are less formal than those brought before higher courts in the state. They do not conduct jury trials; cases are heard and decided by the judge. In civil cases, they are only empowered to award legal damages, and generally cannot provide remedies in equity, such as injunctions or declaratory judgments.  Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court  The Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (J&DR; court) is the low level court dealing with domestic matters, with each case being heard by a single judge. It handles all cases involving juvenile crime, child abuse or child neglect, disputes involving custody and visitation, and other family- related matters, as well as cases in which a child or family member is an alleged victim (it can try misdemeanors, but only preliminary hearings in adult felonies). The court also has authority to allow minors, under certain circumstances, to seek abortions. It may also emancipate a child.  Administration  The administration of the courts is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Uniform Rules and Practices are promulgated by the Supreme Court and govern the practice and procedures to be used in the courts. By statute, the Chief Justice is chosen by a majority vote of the seven justices of the Supreme Court. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals is elected by a vote of the eleven Court of Appeals judges for a term of four years. The state has 120 Circuit Courts divided among 31 judicial circuits. The clerk of the Circuit Court is a constitutional officer and chief administrator of the Circuit Court. There are 32 General District Court districts, each having at least one judge, and each having a clerk of the court and a courthouse. Each district has a chief general district court judge and a chief juvenile and domestic relations district court judge elected by peer vote for a two-year term. The decisions of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and circuit courts are published in the Virginia Reports, Virginia Court of Appeals Reports, and Virginia Circuit Court Opinions, respectively. Most circuit court decisions are not published. The decisions of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals are also published in the unofficial South Eastern Reporter. The Committee on District Courts (CDC) recommends new judgeships, certifies the need to fill district court vacancies, authorizes the number of clerks, magistrates and personnel in each district, establishes guidelines and policies for court system personnel, and fixes salary classification schedules for district court personnel and magistrates. It is composed of the Majority Leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, the Chairmen of the Committees for Courts of Justice in the Senate and House of Delegates, two members of each of the Courts of Justice Committees appointed by the respective Chairman, one circuit court judge, two general district court judges, and two juvenile and domestic relations district court judges. The Judicial Conference of Virginia and the Judicial Conference of Virginia for District Courts discuss and consider means and methods of improving the administration of justice in Virginia. The Judicial Council of Virginia is charged with the responsibility of making a continuous study of the organization, rules, and methods of procedure and practice of the judiciary. The council is composed of the Chief Justice as president, one Court of Appeals judge, six circuit court judges, one general district court judge, one juvenile and domestic relations district court judge, two attorneys qualified to practice in the Supreme Court of Virginia, and the Chairmen of the Committees for Courts of Justice in the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates. The Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) of the Supreme Court provides administrative support for the courts and magistrate offices.  Officers = Judges = The seven justices of the Supreme Court are elected by a majority vote of both houses of the General Assembly for a term of twelve years. To be eligible for election, a candidate must be a resident of Virginia and must have been a member of the Virginia Bar for at least five years. Vacancies on the court occurring between sessions of the General Assembly may be filled by the Governor for a term expiring thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the General Assembly. The eleven Court of Appeals judges are elected by a majority vote of each house of the General Assembly for eight-year terms with interim appointments made by the Governor. The judges of the Circuit Courts are elected by a majority vote of each house of the General Assembly for eight-year terms with interim appointments made by the Governor. The judges of the District Courts are elected by a majority vote of each house of the General Assembly for terms of six years, and interim vacancy appointments when the General Assembly is not in session are made by the Circuit Court of the corresponding circuit.  Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission  The Judicial Inquiry and Review Commission investigates allegations of judicial misconduct or the serious mental or physical disability of a judge. The commission has jurisdiction to investigate the justices of the Supreme Court and all judges of the Commonwealth, as well as members of the State Corporation Commission, the Virginia Workers' Compensation Commission, special justices, substitute judges, and retired judges who have been recalled to service. The Commission may file a formal complaint with the Supreme Court against judges for violations of any canon of judicial ethics, misconduct in office, or failure to perform their judicial duties. The commission has seven members, elected by the General Assembly for four-year terms. Membership includes one circuit court judge, one general district court judge, one juvenile and domestic relations district court judge, two lawyers, and two members of the public who are not lawyers. Commission staff receive and investigate allegations of misconduct and present the findings to the commission. = Magistrates = Magistrates are judicial officers, appointed by the executive secretary of the Supreme Court. Magistrates have the authority to issue adult arrest process, search warrants, emergency protective orders, emergency medical and mental health orders, and certain civil processes. Magistrates also have authority to determine bail for recently arrested individuals. = Special Justices = Special justices are judicial officers with authority to issue civil mental health commitment orders, in Virginia district courts. = Private attorneys = The common law of Virginia permits private attorneys to participate with the government in the prosecution of criminal cases. = Clerks = The clerk of the circuit court is an elected, constitutional officer and chief administrator of the circuit court. The clerks of other courts are appointed by the office of the executive secretary.

The life of Wisigard is slightly known by Gregory of Tours's Historia Francorum.Gregor of Tours, Historiae III,20, III,27. She was daughter of Wacho, king of the Lombards and grew up in the middle Danube region. After an abnormally long term of engagement of seven years, Wisigard married Theudebert I, Merovingian king of Austrasia. Around 531 Theuderich I, father of Theudebert I, had arranged the engagement for political reasons. But because of a liaison Theudebert had with a Roman woman named Deuteria, the union with Wisigard fell through. Anew for political reasons Theudebert abandoned Deoteria and finally married Wisigard in 537 or 538. Shortly after their wedding, she died. Posited burial site in Cologne Cathedral In 1959 a very rich decorated grave of a Frankish woman was found by Otto Doppelfeld in the Cologne Cathedral. The woman had been buried with her precious jewelry and in a traditional costume that indicated her as a Lombardish princess. Based on the dating and the grave furniture, Doppelfeld, at that time director of the Romano-Germanic Museum, interpreted the dead woman as Wisigard. However, this interpretation is not proved by an inscription or other sources. Sources *Gregory of Tours, Historiarum III, 20, 27. References *Christian Bouyer: Dictionnaire des Reines de France.

The documentary covers the period from September 2008 until the end of the war in 2009 in which thousands of Tamil people were killed by shelling and extrajudicial executions by the Sri Lankan Army including Balachandran Prabhakaran, the 12-year-old son of the slain Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) Chief Velupillai Prabhakaran.Joseph, Manu. \\"Revisiting the Horror in Sri Lanka.\\" The New York Times. 3 March 2013 The Sri Lankan army has denied the allegations in the documentary. However, on 21 October 2015 the BBC reported that Maxwell Paranagama, a government-appointed Sri Lankan judge, says allegations the army committed war crimes during the long conflict with Tamil Tiger rebels are \\"credible\\". He went on to say there was evidence to suggest that footage obtained by the Channel 4 documentary No Fire Zone - showing prisoners naked, blindfolded, with arms tied and shot dead by soldiers - was genuine. Synopsis This feature documentary is the product of a three-year investigation and tells the story of the final awful months of the 26-year- long Sri Lankan civil war: This sometimes harrowing story is told by the people who lived through the war - and through some of the most dramatic and disturbing video evidence ever seen. This footage - direct evidence of war crimes, summary execution, torture and sexual violence - was recorded by both the victims and perpetrators on mobile phones and small cameras during the final 138 days of hell which form the central narrative of the film. No Fire Zone is directed by the Nobel Peace Prize nominee Callum Macrae, a Peabody and Colombia Dupont Broadcast Journalism Award winner and Greirson and BAFTA nominee. It has already won many awards and is a nominee for an International Emmy Award 2014. No Fire Zone has been described as something of an international phenomenon. Not just an agenda setting investigation, but a cinematic tour de force ‚Äì a stunning and disturbing film in its own right. It was described as \\"beautifully crafted and heart wrenching‚Äù by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting in Washington, \\"utterly convincing\\" by the Globe and Mail in Toronto - and in the UK, Empire noted: \\"It is vitally important that this feature reaches the widest possible audience‚Äù. One critic in Australia described it as ‚Äúthe most devastating film I have seen‚Äù, whilst the London Film Review says \\"No Fire Zone shocks on every level. It shocks, it educates, and it convinces\\" It has been widely praised by personalities as disparate as the rapper M.I.A and the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, who said: ‚ÄùNo Fire Zone is one of the most chilling documentaries I‚Äôve watched‚Ä¶‚Äù Film In March 2013, the documentary was screened by its director, Callum Macrae, at the 22nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. The film was not released in theatres in India as Central Board of Film Certification did not approved it. In response to this attempt at censorship No fire Zone was released online for free in India and Malaysia as well as Sri Lanka and Nepal. In November 2014 the Musician M.I.A described No Fire Zone as ‚Äúthe only film that gives me faith in journalism. It's not only the most important account of what happened to the Tamils, it's actually become part of the fabric of their history.\\" Awards and Festival Screenings Festival des Libertes 2013 - Winner of FIDH Best Film Award.

Sheffield Documentary Festival 2013 No Fire Zone (TV version) was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2014 International Emmy Awards and was awarded the Britdoc Impact Award as well as being shortlisted for a Grierson award Controversy Despite the painstaking checking and independent verification of the footage contained within the film, the Sri Lankan government continue to maintain that the footage contained within the film is faked. However, as more and more evidence continues to emerge this position becomes ever more untenable. In March 2014 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights voted to establish an independent international inquiry into the events covered in the film and subsequent and ongoing human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. Despite the international mandate for this inquiry the government of Sri Lanka has refused to cooperate and has denied the UNCHR investigators entry to Sri Lanka. The Government of Sri Lanka have also been active in trying to prevent the film being seen. Just prior to No Fire Zone being screened at the Film south Asia festival in Nepal, the Nepalese government were pressurised by the Government of Sri Lanka into trying to have the advertised screening stopped. The organisers of the festival bravely ignored the ban and held two screenings rather than the single advertised screening. Again in Malaysia, despite the film having already been screened at the Malaysian parliament, a private human rights organisation screening of the film in Kuala Lumpur was raided and the organisers arrested. Just prior to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting held in Colombo in November 2013, a book entitled Corrupted Journalism appeared. This book is published and written by a mysterious group called \\"Engage Sri Lanka\\" but is widely believed to be a product of the Sri Lankan government and is widely believed to be an attempt to propagate the Sri Lankan government line that the allegations made in the film and the previous two documentaries shown on UK television by Channel 4 are false. This book was widely distributed and was even included in the delegate pack at the conference until removed at the insistence of the Commonwealth secretariat. Links to the publication also appeared on the Home pages of Sri Lankan Embassy websites around the World. In response to the allegations made within this book Channel 4 published a detailed rebuttal written by the film's director Callum Macrae entitled The Uncorrupted Truth  Updated Versions  In November 2014 the producers released an updated version of the film containing new evidence, including footage showing the capture, alive, of the LTTE TV presenter Isaipriya. Previously the Sri Lankan government had claimed she had died in battle. This update also included an interview with one of the Tamil doctors who had been trapped in the No Fire Zone. During the war the doctors told the world of the terrible conditions in the no Fire Zone, but after the war they were arrested and he held by the Sri Lankan Criminal Investigation Department. While in captivity they were forced to appear at a stage managed government press conference and deny everything they said from the war zone. In this interview - a longer version of which appeared on Channel 4 news in the UK - the most senior of the doctors revealed that he and the other doctors had been forced by Sri Lankan military intelligence to change their story - and confirmed that what they had said from the war zone was indeed accurate. In January 2015 it was announced that the producers were working on a Sinhala language version of the film to be released later that month. Also in January 2015, following the defeat of President Rajapaksa in Sri Lanka's presidential election, the film was re-released with a further update in time for a US campus tour organized by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting starting in February 2015.

Design and development Walter NZ-60 and Pander EC First prototype with Anzani engine Pander followed their first aircraft, the small, single-seat monoplane Pander D with a two-seat, low-powered biplane for club and training use. The Pander E was a true sesquiplane, with a lower wingspan exactly half that of the upper span; in plan, though not in detailed construction the lower wing was almost a half scale copy of the upper wing, the two maximum chords being in the ratio of 0.52 and the area ratio 0.23. The wings were entirely of wooden construction, apart from part of their covering. The upper plane was built around two box spars with spruce flanges and plywood webs. From the leading edge to behind the forward spar the covering was three-ply, with fabric aft. There were ailerons only on this upper wing. The narrower lower wings were of similar construction but used only a single box spar, though this was extended into a larger D-box by ply skinning forward around the leading edge. The wings were arranged so that the rear spar of the upper one was vertically above the single lower wing spar and the aft member of the V-form interplane struts was correspondingly vertical, with the forward member reaching forward to the forward upper spar. These Vs leaned outwards, their base on the lower wing strengthened with a further single strut to the upper fuselage longeron. The upper wing, built in two pieces, was held high above the fuselage by four cabane struts to the front spar and two more to the aft; the wings were pin-jointed to them. The fuselage of the early Pander Es was of mixed construction, the forward structure from welded steel tubes with aluminium sheet skinning and the rear wood-framed and plywood-covered. From the seventh aircraft onward, the fuselage became an all-metal structure. The fin and tailplane were wood framed and ply covered but the rudder and elevators had steel tube leading edges and sheet steel ribs. The open, tandem cockpits were fitted with dual control. The first Pander Es had a 45 hp (33 kW) Anzani 6-cylinder radial engine, cowled but with the cylinder heads exposed for cooling; later models used several different engines including members of the Walter NZ radial family engine as well as the de Havilland Gipsy inline. The fixed, conventional undercarriage was a steel tube structure with a single axle supported by V-form stuts on each side, one leg to the upper fuselage longeron and one to the lower, braced laterally by short struts to the lower centre fuselage. The first Pander E flew on 18 February 1926. Operational history One of the first public appearances of the Pander E first prototype was at the Coupe Zenith, held on 4 July 1926, where it was placed fourth. It was destroyed in a fatal crash less than a month later. Nonetheless, the Rotterdam Aero Club (RAC) placed an initial order for two, received in 1927, and another the following year; these were the first Dutch aircraft used for training. For financial reasons they set up the National Aviation School (NLS) and in 1929 transferred their three aircraft, all ECs with the 60 hp (33 kW) five-cylinder engine, to the NLS. Between then and 1932 the NLS received four more new aircraft from Pander, all 85 hp (63 kW), seven- cylinder powered EFs. In 1930 they acquired a previously privately owned EC and in 1932 a privately owned Gipsy-powered EG. The Dutch East Indies Flying Club bought two EGs, and there were five other individually owned examples, one EF and three EGs.

It is a Grade II* listed building. The church became the property of Montacute Priory and then part of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. It still contains some fabric and fittings from the 14th and 15th centuries but underwent a major restoration in the Victorian era. The church fell into disrepair in the 20th century but has been taken over and restored as the Fleet Air Arm‚Äôs Memorial Church following links since World War II with the nearby airbase RNAS Yeovilton. History The original Norman church was built of local lias stone with Hamstone dressings. It was granted by Sir William of Yeovilton to Montacute Priory between 1272 and 1282, who then sold it to Robert Burnell the Bishop of Bath and Wells and it eventually became part of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. From 1642 Richard Sterne held the rectory of Yeovilton before going on to become Archbishop of York. The rector between 1762 and 1805 was Daniel Dumaresq after his period as an educational consultant to Russian and Polish monarchs. The chancel contains a 14th-century piscina and some 15th-century stained glass. The nave has a 15th-century font. The vestry was added in 1872, when a major Victorian restoration was undertaken, and the wagon roof replaced. Tower and bells The three stage tower was built in 1486. The money for this was donated by Richard Swan, the rector at the time. It contains six bells, the oldest of which dates from around 1430 and was cast at the Exeter Bell foundry. The most recent was added in 1993 and was cast at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. Fleet Air Arm Memorial Church In the first half of the 20th century the church was falling into disrepair until after World War II an association developed with the staff from the nearby RNAS Yeovilton. The churchyard contains 15 graves of British and Commonwealth forces during World War II mostly from the airbase. By 1988 the fabric of the building was considered unsafe and the church declared redundant, and was sold to the Royal Navy for ¬£1. Restoration work was carried out funded by public donation and, in 1993, the church was reopened as the Fleet Air Arm‚Äôs Memorial Church. The church holds the Fleet Air Arm‚Äôs Roll of Honour. New porch gates, which were made at HMS Daedalus and carry the emblem of the Fleet Air Arm, have been installed. Within the Fleet Air Arm Memorial Chapel modern stained glass has been installed with the badges of RNAS stations Gannet, Osprey, Heron, Seahawk and Deadalus.

History The station was established in 1998 by Theuns Cloete, one of three members of the Transvaal Separatists think tank. The mission of the station was to broadcast Afrikaans music and talk shows about Boer identity and culture, but also as mouthpiece for the Transvaal Separatists. It supports Afrikaans music from independent artists, as noted by Wildhorse Entertainment where songs are made freely available to listeners of Boervolk Radio. The primary perspective of the Transvaal Separatists was that all individual tribes which were forcibly included first in the Union of South Africa and later the Republic of South Africa, should have the opportunity for self-determination within the southern African region. This view of devolution of power from the National Party (South Africa) controlled apartheid government was shared by the federalist solution proposed at the Kwazulu/Natal Indaba. At the Natal Indaba the traditional Zulu leaders acknowledged the interest of the Boer people in the northern part of Kwazulu-Natal. The Zulu people was and remain the majority people of the KwaZulu-Natal region. The station has not supported any political parties or religious groups from its founding. This perspective remains unchanged to this day. The station prides itself in always urging listeners to research political, national and international affairs themselves as opposed to blindly following activist groups and political parties. It is known for speaking out against movements supporting violent protests and actions, specifically from right-wing groups. For this reason it has endured scorn from the right, contrary to some media reports that the think tank was a right-wing organisation itself. The Transvaal Separatists strongly opposed violent protest prior to the 1994 elections in South Africa. It held meetings with various political parties to the right of the political spectrum in the 1980s and early 1990s in an attempt to convince these groups that joining open discussions with all relevant role players in South Africa was the only viable route towards transition from minority rule. The Transvaal Separatists had specific discussions with Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging to convince him of the importance to join CODESA negotiations. These talks culminated in a meeting with the then State President of South Africa, FW de Klerk in 1989. Boervolk Radio, represented by Theuns Cloete, was interviewed on 6 January 2007 by The Right Perspective, a talk show based in New York City, on the 150th anniversary of the Vierkleur flag. The interview was recorded and is available here together with a synopsis of the podcast.

The portrait is by the Swedish artist Per S√∂dermark Hakon Jarl (Op. 16) is a symphonic poem in C minor composed by Bed≈ôich Smetana between 1860 and 1861. It is based on the historical tragedy of the same name by the Danish poet and playwright Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. The play's protagonist and namesake is H√•kon Jarl who ruled Norway in the late 10th century. Background and performance history Hakon Jarl is the third and last of Smetana's so- called \\"Swedish\\" symphonic poems, composed during the years he spent in Gothenburg (1857‚Äì1861). His visit to Franz Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard Liszt's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music and suggested to him a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights are reflected in Hakon Jarl and the first two symphonic poems he wrote in Gothenburg: Richard III (1858), and Wallenstein's Camp (1859).Ottlov√°, Marta. \\"Smetana, Bedrich\\" (Section 1). Grove Music Online, ed. Laura Macy. Retrieved 12 May 2009 . The subject matter of Hakon Jarl, which was based on Oehlenschl√§ger's 1804 play about a legendary Norse ruler and the triumph of Christianity over paganism in Scandinavia, was possibly chosen to appeal to Smetana's intended audience in Gothenburg. However, according to musicologist Richard Taruskin, the work's poetic and musical themes show no particular Scandinavian colour and are \\"universally heroic and religious\\" in nature.Taruskin, Richard (2009). Music in the Nineteenth Century: The Oxford History of Western Music, p. 446. Oxford University Press In the end, Hakon Jarl and Smetana's previous two symphonic poems premiered in his Czech homeland instead of Sweden. Smetana finished the first sketch of Hakon Jarl on 6 January 1860 and completed the work on 24 March 1861. Shortly thereafter he returned permanently to Prague where it was performed for the first time on 24 February 1864.DeLong, Kenneth (1998). \\"Hearing His Master's Voice: Smetana's 'Swedish' Symphonic Poems and their Lisztian Models\\" in Michael Saffle (ed.), Liszt and His World, pp. 295‚Äì334.
