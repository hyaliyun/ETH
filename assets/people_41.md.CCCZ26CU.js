Administratively this range is part of the Northeast Greenland National Park zone. The range was named by Eigil Nielsen during the 1938‚Äì39 M√∏rkefjord Expedition after Princess Elisabeth of Denmark (1935‚Äì2018), daughter of Prince Knud. Geography The Princess Elizabeth Alps run roughly from north to south across the western half of the large Crown Prince Christian Land peninsula with an average elevation of . The range begins abruptly at the Ingolf Fjord in the south, with the mountains rising steeply from the shore. Towards the northern end the elevations decrease until the range becomes a chain of small nunataks barely rising above the surrounding ice sheet.Google Earth The area of the range is bounded in the north by the Flade Isblink, a massive ice sheet, to the west by the Nunataami Elv valley, to the south by the Ingolf Fjord, and to the east by the Tobias Glacier, beyond which lies Amdrup Land. The Princess Caroline-Mathilde Alps located to the south in Holm Land across the fjord display a similar structure. The Princess Elizabeth Alps lie in a desolate and uninhabited part of Greenland.

Cai also teaches as the Lee Wing Tat Chair Professor of Chinese Literature at Lingnan University (Hong Kong). Widely published in both English and Chinese, Prof. Cai puts equal emphasis on individual research, collective contributions and the development of a mutually beneficial East-West literary academic culture. Cai edits the Columbia University Press series How to Read Chinese Literature as well as the Brill book series Chinese Texts in the World, the Journal of Chinese Literature and Culture (Duke UP), Prism: Theory and Modern Chinese Literature (Duke UP), and Lingnan Journal of Chinese Studies.  Early focus on Six Dynasties period  Zong-qi Cai's revised doctoral dissertation published in 1996 as The Matrix of Lyric Transformation: Poetic Modes and Self-Presentation in Early Chinese Pentasyllabic Poetry is foundational for the studies of the birth and evolution of one of the most important Chinese poetic genres. His committee at Princeton University included Chinese poetry mentor Yu-kung Kao and Andrew H. Plaks. This lyric genre emerged from the Han dynasty Music Bureau or Yuefu tradition, cultivated a distinct literati ancient style in the Nineteen Old Poems, and developed diverse modes of self- presentation in the poetry of Cao Zhi and Ruan Ji. The continuity from the earliest specimens of Chinese poetry through its subsequent developments can be experienced with unique intensity due to Cai's emphasis on close readings of the original. While the grandeur might be taken for granted in these early works, as well as selective use of folksiness, Cai traces many distinct emerging themes and emphasizes that of transience because of its centrality to subsequent Six Dynasties concerns. Liu Xie (ca. 465 - ca. 521) enjoys paramount status among ancient Chinese literary critics in part because his major work survived, The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons. In 2001, Cai edited and published A Chinese Literary Mind: Culture, Creativity, and Rhetoric in Wenxin Diaolong, a thorough treatment of this masterwork. Notable contributors included Kang-i Sun Chang, Wai-yee Li, Shuen-fu Lin, Richard John Lynn, Victor H. Mair, Stephen Owen, and Andrew H. Plaks, among others. Stephen Owen explains how Liu Xie's formal exposition embodies a \\"discourse machine\\" with a logic that contends with Liu's authorial discretion. Owen's Readings in Chinese Literary Thought explains and translates portions of Wenxin diaolong (183-298) but A Chinese Literary Mind is noteworthy in contrast for its comprehensive treatment by multiple contributors. Chinese Aesthetics: The Ordering of Literature, the Arts, & the Universe in the Six Dynasties, edited by Cai in 2004, includes contributions by Kang-i Sun Chang, Ronald Egan, Wai- yee Li, Shuen-fu Lin, Victor H. Mair, and others. The Six Dynasties were an important gestational period for traditional Chinese culture when the roots of many later developments first took hold, influenced both by the contending political entities of the period and by the widespread assimilation of Indian Buddhist outlooks. Essay topics include the philosophical conversations of A New Account of the Tales of the World that contributed to the emergence of aesthetic self-consciousness and also the artistic significance of Shen, the Chinese word for \\"spirit.\\" During these formative years for Chinese traditional culture, activities such as literature, music, painting, calligraphy, and gardening began to take on their associations with metaphysics and higher meaning.  Expanding contributions to Chinese literary studies and outreach  Cai‚Äôs monograph Configurations of Comparative Poetics: Three Perspectives on Western and Chinese Literary Criticism (2002) emphasizes the need for \\"transcultural\\" studies as a step beyond cross-cultural assimilation. Juxtaposing the Chinese and Western traditions of literary criticism, Cai offers detailed comparative studies of William Wordsworth's analysis of the creative process and Liu Xie‚Äôs, between Plato and Confucius, between Ernest Fenollosa and Ezra Pound's views of the Chinese written character and the aesthetics of the dynamic force embodied in Chinese calligraphy, as well as between the philosophies of Jacques Derrida and Madhyamaka Buddhism. This bicultural or transcultural approach presages Cai's later endeavors to bring the communities of Chinese and American academics together, promoting the investigation of traditional Chinese culture by increased international sharing of perspectives.  The How to Read Chinese Literature series  How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology (2008) was edited by Cai and features contributors including Ronald Egan, Grace S. Fong, David R. Knechtges, Xinda Lian, Shuen-fu Lin, William H. Nienhauser Jr., and Xiaofei Tian. Featuring 143 poems and addressing the full scope of the Chinese poetic tradition, this book reflects a bold, collective effort to render that tradition more accessible. For example, the Tang dynasty chapters feature close readings of poems by the famous poets Bai Juyi, Du Fu, Li Bai, and Wang Wei, and just this small group represents a mountain of high accomplishment known to most Chinese schoolkids. Every poetic period and format has its own special high points and the presentation makes clear how exploring Chinese poetry can become a never-ending journey. With the Chinese characters and pinyin transcriptions side-by-side as well as audio files available online, the format provides an integrated experience of the source material intended to increase enrichment and appreciation, deepened by the accompanying literary criticism. In 2012 the How to Read Chinese Poetry Workbook appeared, by Jie Cui and Cai, using easy-to-read layout to present 100 representative poems with extensive annotations and exercises. The workbook is organized around themes such as \\"Love: the Voice of Men,\\" \\"Parting,\\" and \\"Meditation on History: Rise and Fall of Dynasties.\\" In 2018 How to Read Chinese Poetry in Context: Poetic Culture from Antiquity Through the Tang was published by Columbia University Press, followed by the three \\"How to Read Chinese Poetry\\" books being repackaged within the \\"How to Read Chinese Literature\\" series. Encompassing drama, prose, fiction, and literary theory, as well as poetry, these volumes provide unique access to original texts and commentary, breaking down barriers in support of innovative language and literary study.  Journal of Chinese Literature and Culture  The 2014 inaugural issue of the Journal of Chinese Literature and Culture by Duke University Press initiated a successful series of collaborations by academics on both sides of the Pacific Ocean to share ideas and research. As Yuan Xingpei of Peking University and Zong-qi Cai wrote together in its foreword, \\"we hope to usher in a new kind of Chinese literary scholarship that will transcend traditional national and cultural boundaries. In-depth collaboration between Chinese and Western scholars is only a first step toward achieving our ideal of 'scholarly traditions around the world form one family'.\\" The U.S. side of JCLC editing is based at the Forum on Chinese Poetic Culture while the China-based team collaborates with national and international scholars from the hub of Peking University. A special issue, Sound and Sense of Chinese Poetry (November 2015), edited by Cai, features a study by him of monosyllabic sound as the basis of Chinese poetic art, parsing the ways monosyllabic meanings punctuate and encourage lyrical flow in Chinese poetry's densely referential and enjoyably prosodic short lines.  Lingnan Journal of Chinese Studies  In tandem with the launch of Journal of Chinese Literature and Culture in 2014, Cai presided over the relaunch of the Lingnan Journal of Chinese Studies (Â∂∫ÂçóÂ≠∏Â†±). The old LJCS (1929-1952) was a renowned venue of publication for leading 20th century Chinese scholars including Rong Geng, Wang Li, Wu Mi and others. Through a close partnership with JCLC, the new LJCS strives to build a Chinese-language platform of in-depth international collaboration for promoting cutting edge research in traditional Chinese humanities.  Prism: Theory and Modern Chinese Literature  The Forum on Chinese Poetic Culture and Lingnan University co-host Prism as 2019's new incarnation of Lingnan's Centre for Humanities Research's 1997 Journal of Modern Literature in Chinese. Through research articles, book reviews, and special issues, JMLC strives to provide a bilingual platform for broad studies including scholars from both the American and Chinese academic traditions as well as material drawn from across the broader Sinophone world.  Forum on Chinese Poetic Culture  The mission of this Forum, Cai explains, \\"is to establish an open platform for promoting the learning and teaching of Chinese poetry and poetic culture. The Forum strives to provide a broad range of services for students, scholars, and all Chinese poetry lovers.\\" In 2012 the Forum held its inaugural conference, \\"Stories of Chinese Poetic Culture: Earliest Times through the Tang,\\" with presentations by Robert Ashmore, Jack Chen, Wai-yee Li, Stephen Owen, Maija Bell Samei, and Paula Varsano, among others. This conference presented the contributions which appear in the 2018 Columbia University Press volume How to Read Chinese Poetry in Context: Poetic Culture from Antiquity Through the Tang. Another major development for the Forum was the publication of the inaugural issue of JCLC. The Forum co-hosts JCLC with the International Academy for Chinese Studies, Peking University, and co-hosts Prism with Lingnan University.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, through the Chinese Canton System (Canton Port) and also after that, the opium war, the Treaty of Nanking and Treaty of Tientsin, Chinese Qing Dynasty became a major exporter for fine Chinese goods such as tea, spices and porcelain etc. to Europe, Germany, France, Russia and America. Treaty trading ports were further extended throughout the entire Qing Dynasty's land. Historically, silver had been more valuable in China than Europe, relative to gold and other commodities, and European traders had for centuries paid for their purchases of Chinese goods with silver. Now for the first time price levels made the importation of silver objects made for export to Europe attractive. Though the Chinese government had for centuries been content to see renewable or inexhaustible luxury products such as silk or ceramics leave China as trade goods or diplomatic gifts, they had tried to retain as much silver as possible in China. Now they were unable to do this. Just as the Chinese potters produced Chinese export porcelain for Western consumers, Chinese silversmiths also created elaborately-decorated objects for international clients. Early works of Chinese Export Silver was intended to reproduce or copy objects in European styles. However, in copying the European style or model objects, the Chinese artisans later managed to add to new decorations such Chinese motifs as the dragon, flowers, bamboo and scenes of life at the Chinese court. Blending Western forms with Asian decoration including dragons, bamboo, and Chinese landscapes, these pieces reflect the long-standing cultural and commercial exchange between East and West. History Most of them were loaded at Shanghai and Tientsin. At the end of the 16th century, regular trade with the West had indeed been going on since the time of the Roman Empire when China was known as Seres - the land of Silk. The Portuguese had established the first \\"modern\\" trading station in China as early as 1514. In the 18th century western artists started to make up decorative items and whole interiors in a mock Chinese or Japanese style. These Western \\"Chinoiserie\\" designs became an important element of the arts and styles of the mid 18th century. From the late 18th century to the first quarter of the 19th, as the export trade increased, so did the demand from Europe for familiar, utilitarian forms. European forms such as mugs, ewers, tazza, and candlesticks were unknown in China so models were sent to the Chinese silversmith to be copied. Chinese silversmiths basically made these objects completely based on prototypes from England and America. Common items were tea and coffee sets, spoon, forks, trays and other flat wares. From the second quarter of the 19th century onward, Chinese forms and decoration became popular. In late 19th century, Chinese silversmiths added Chinese motifs such as the dragon and phoenix and scenes of life at the Chinese court. Chinese Silver \\"Hallmarks\\" During the early Chinese Export Silver Period, silversmiths faithfully copied functional British or American items like flatware, tankards, and tea sets. Since they did not understand the significance of British silver hallmarks, they often unwittingly copied them as well, but with crude symbols or altered lettering. Some of the earlier known Chinese Export Silver makers' chopped mark are: We We WC and Cutshing. Because of the way it often was marked, most Chinese Export silver is not easy for the average collector to identify, and can be confused with silver made in England or early 19th-century America. The small chopped or marks found on items of Chinese Export Silver are not hallmarks. Hallmarks are small markings stamped on the object that indicates that an official (usually a local assayer) in a particular country guarantees that the item is made from a certain percentage of silver. There is actually no assay system in Chinese China. We can only describe these small marking as marker's mark. It represents the firm producing the Silver. Some are in Chinese character while others are in alphabets.

She is known for formulating the umbral moonshine conjectures and for her work on the connections between K3 surfaces and string theory.. Early life Cheng grew up in Taiwan, where she was first interested in literature. At around twelve years old, she was interested in music, including pop music, rock, and punk. Because the material at her school was too easy, she skipped two years and got moved to a special class. The competitiveness and stress that came from school caused her to drop out and leave her parents' home to work at a record store and play in a punk rock band at the age of 16. Despite not completing high school, she was able to enter university through a program for gifted science students that she had gone through.  Education  After graduating from the Department of Physics at National Taiwan University in 2001, she moved to the Netherlands to continue her studies, and earned a master's degree in theoretical physics in 2003 from Utrecht University, under the supervision of Nobel laureate Gerard 't Hooft. She completed her Ph.D. in 2008 from the University of Amsterdam under the joint supervision of Erik Verlinde and Kostas Skenderis. After postdoctoral study at Harvard University and working as a researcher at CNRS, she returned to Amsterdam in 2014, with a joint position in the Institute of Physics and Korteweg‚Äìde Vries Institute for Mathematics.  Work with the Umbral Moonshine Conjecture  Cheng, along with John Duncan of Case Western Reserve University and Jeffrey Harvey of the University of Chicago, formulated the Umbral Moonshine Conjecture in 2012, providing evidence of 23 new moonshines. They postulated that for each of these moonshines, there is a string theory, in which the string states are counted by the mock modular forms and the finite group captures the model's symmetry. In reference to the string theory underlying umbral moonshine, Cheng said that ‚Äúit suggests that there‚Äôs a special symmetry acting on the physical theory of K3 surfaces.‚Äù References External links *Home page  * 1979 births Living people 21st-century Dutch mathematicians 21st-century Dutch scientists Dutch women mathematicians Dutch physicists Dutch women physicists Taiwanese mathematicians Taiwanese physicists Taiwanese women physicists Scientists from Taipei Utrecht University alumni University of Amsterdam alumni University of Amsterdam faculty Taiwanese emigrants to the Netherlands 21st-century women mathematicians ","title":"Miranda Cheng"},{"id":"51249784","text":"Karl Gotthelf Lehmann (ca. 1855) Karl Gotthelf Lehmann (7 March 1812 in Leipzig - 6 January 1863 in Jena) was a German physiological chemist.

The courthouse was constructed between 1910-1911 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) has also designated the building as a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark since 2000 and, along with the surrounding courthouse square, as a State Antiquities Landmark since 2003. The surrounding county and county seat, along with the nearby historic frontier fort at Fort Davis National Historic Site, are named after Jefferson Davis, who served as U.S. war secretary at the time of the establishment of the fort and the town, and who would later become president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. The courthouse is located in the town's traditionally commercial district and holds the distinction of having the highest elevation of any of the state's courthouses due to Fort Davis' altitude in the state's western Davis Mountains. The building was constructed in a Classic Revival style with recessed columned porticoes on two sides with a Beaux-Arts clock tower atop. The ground floor primarily hosts county offices while the second floor is dominated by the district courtroom. A previous facility located on the same square from 1880 to 1911 served as the original courthouse for both Jeff Davis County and also for Presidio County from which Jeff Davis County was partitioned and of which Fort Davis also formerly served as the county seat. The older courthouse was an adobe facility that required constant maintenance and never held sufficient space to serve the needs of either county government. The current building has also suffered over its history with poor construction requiring constant repair as well as the need for upgrades to modern infrastructure and technical standards. The courthouse underwent major renovations in the 1950s, many of which disrespected the building's original architectural design, and again in this century with THC funding that further modernized the structure while rectifying many of the previous renovation's design deficiencies bringing the building closer to its original glory. The courthouse grounds are planted mostly with native species, and continues to serve as a focal point for holiday celebrations and community observations. Description SH 17 / SH 118) in Fort Davis The courthouse is located in the center of Fort Davis' courthouse square on a block bounded by Court Avenue to the north, South State Street to the east, Woodward Avenue to the south, and South Front Street on the west. State St., along the square's eastern boundary, is the town's main thoroughfare conveying both State Highway 17 (SH 17) and SH 118 which merge just south of the square's southeastern corner at Woodward Ave. The building's official address is 100 Court Avenue along the northern face of the courthouse. The two-story Classic Revival edifice features an exterior with alternating layers of concrete and rusticated pink native stone. Six doric columns enclose recessed pedimented porticoes on each of the northern and southern faces of the building. From the building's slab-on-grade foundation to the sill of the first-story windows is a base composed of a poured-in-place water table. Above that is the layered concrete and volcanic stone exterior walls most of which is slightly recessed from concrete block quoins. Above the second story windows begins a painted, decorative sheet metal entablature capped with a prominent cornice. Above the central portion of each of the building's four sides is a wood-framed, low- pitched, cross-gabled roof with pediments at each end covered with asphalt shingles. The four corner sections have low-pitched roofs with external gutters. Atop the structure is a Beaux-Arts octagonal clock tower enclosing a Seth Thomas timepiece. This cupola, including its dome and rectangular base, are covered in painted, decorative sheet metal. A U.S. Geological Survey benchmark at the east side of the courthouse indicates an elevation of at that location, while the building itself is the highest courthouse in Texas at . THC documentation describes the building as resembling a smaller version of the Mason County Courthouse in Mason. In addition to the building, a cylindrical concrete block cistern constructed around 1900 located on the southwest corner of the courthouse square is included as a contributing structure to the site's National Register designation. The courthouse's base floor, elevated above the ground of the surrounding square and accessible from steps on each side of the building except the wheelchair-accessible west side, holds space for several county offices arranged around central crossing corridors connecting the entrances in the middle of each side of the building in each cardinal direction. The base floor also includes the county judge's courtroom, a vault for storage of county records, restrooms, and storage space. On the east side of the building, two flights of stairs lead to the second floor. The first flight consists of two separate stairways that combine around the base of a wider central flight ending at the second floor facing the entrance to the main courtroom. A second stairway is located south of the west end of the building's main central corridor and is used to provide access to offices and other facilities behind the upper courtroom and as use as a secondary fire escape. An elevator on the southeast side of the building also adjoins the two main floors. The second floor of the structure is dominated by the main courtroom occupying all of the space between the north and south porticoes with windows shaded by the porticoes. The judge's podium, witness stand, and position for court officials are located beyond the west end of the courtroom which includes stained glass fixtures, including a fan-shaped ornament behind the judge's podium, filtering outside light from windows behind. The jury box is along the south wall to the right of the podium while a table for additional officials is along the north wall to the left of the podium. Tables for trial adversaries and their counsel face the podium and are separated by a central aisle. The spectator section comprises the central and eastern portions of the room and is separated by a golden oak railing from the parties of the proceedings. Above the spectator section is a balcony, often called the \\"buzzard's roost\\", providing additional spectator seating. The courtroom features a ornamental tin pressed ceiling. East of the courtroom on both sides of the landing of the central staircase from the first floor are additional county offices, the elevator shaft, and storage space. Stairways on both sides of the central stairway from below lead upward one flight combining to a central flight to the courtroom balcony and the east end of the third floor. The west wing of the second floor behind the judge's podium includes the judge's chamber, the jury room, additional office and storage space, and a single-toilet restroom. The fire stairway from the first floor continues upward to the third. The east and west wings of the third floor of the courthouse are separated and unconnected due to the high ceiling of the main courtroom on the second floor beyond the courtroom's balcony. The east wing on both sides of the central stairway from the second floor leading to the courtroom balcony are storage and mechanical spaces. The small stairway on the west wing from the second floor opens into a storage area with potential office usage. This area has an additional stairway leading into the building's attic and clock house tower. The floor is narrower than the courtroom on each end of the building and above the rooftop in all of the courthouse's corner quadrants. The surrounding courthouse square supports an arboretum featuring predominantly native tree species. Located around the courthouse grounds are several state historical markers and monuments including one recognizing the courthouse itself. Other state historical markers include one recognizing local namesake Jefferson Davis and a pink granite monument recounting the Confederate occupation and abandonment of the town and its military fort during the Civil War. An additional monument recognizes local hero Sgt. Manuel Gonzales for his valiant accomplishments during World War II. Both the Confederate and Gonzales monuments, on the northeast grounds of the square, are recognized resources as non-contributing objects as part of the site's National Register status. At the entrance of each side of the building are semicircular landings equal in width to the steps thereby making the landings at the principal north and south entrance much larger. From each landing are straight sidewalks, first constructed in 1918, leading directly toward the streets. A fence constructed of steel pipes around 1915 lines the perimeter of the property. The fence includes turnstiles installed where the entrance sidewalks at the center of each side of the property. For greater accessibility, the west turnstile has been removed, and a larger gate has been installed on the south side. History View of the east and north faces of the present Jeff Davis County Courthouse during construction between 1910-1911. To the right is the original courthouse no longer extant. The U.S. Army garrison of Fort Davis was commissioned in 1854 enabling the settlement of the nearby supporting civilian town site under the fort's protection from hostile Native Americans. At the time, Fort Davis belonged to a much larger Presidio County, created by the Texas Legislature in 1850, that encompassed most of the present region of Texas west of the Pecos River. After several fruitless attempts, the county was successfully organized in 1875 then comprising present-day Brewster, Jeff Davis, and Presidio counties. That year, the county accepted the gift of a land parcel in Fort Davis for the site of a future courthouse and county jail from local merchant Whittaker Keesey. Nevertheless, the county initially needed to rent office and court space, first in a dance hall, and then from space provided by another townsman while an additional local merchant rented furniture. Jail space was rented from Keesey at his family's store. =Original courthouse= Original courthouse in Fort Davis; the handwritten description on the back of the photo may be viewed here In 1879, the Presidio County Commissioners Court assessed a 50-cent tax per $100 valuation to finance the construction of what would become the original Presidio County Courthouse and jail on the previously donated Keesey property on the northwestern portion of the present courthouse square in Fort Davis. The Commissioners Court accepted a bid of $2,400 from William Jenkins to design and build the courthouse and jail. The new facility, on the street corner at the northwest corner of the parcel, was completed in 1880. It was of adobe construction and fashioned into a U-shape surrounding an open courtyard. The courtyard included a well and was enclosed with a to adobe wall with a massive gate and a smaller entrance door within the gate. The building probably contained only three rooms and featured an by jail cell below the sheriff's office and guard room accessible through a trap door. The dungeon cell was poorly lit and ventilated with narrow slits of heavily barred windows along the top of the walls. This jail configuration was common among Southwestern courthouses at the time, including contemporary facilities in El Paso and San Antonio, and often referenced as \\"Batcaves\\". Prisoners were chained to six iron bull rings fastened into the walls with wrought iron pickets located from the floor. The guard room above included an iron cell for drunks and less dangerous prisoners including women. Due to the courthouse's small size, the county needed to rent additional office space nearly immediately after completion. The building's inadequate space combined with a leaking roof would cause repairs and improvements to consume the majority of commissioners' time after 1982. In 1883, county commissioners denounced the building as too small and badly in need of repairs. After publishing an invitation for bids to construct a new, two-floor facility, they accepted one offered by Keesey due to his original land donation. One month later, after political infighting that resulted in the resignation of the county judge, all bids were then rejected. In the aftermath, the next meeting of the Commissioners Court called for a new tax levy to provide additional rooms for the jail and county clerk's office and five iron cages for upper jail cell. Although the cages were indeed installed, there is little proof that the building underwent any further expansion. In 1884, glass was installed in the windows of the clerk's office, and the sheriff was ordered to remove the water closet and fill the well in the courtyard. The facility would serve as the seat of Presidio County until 1885 when the town of Marfa, one of several newly emergent communities in the county along the recently constructed Southern Pacific Railroad, would take advantage of its growing political clout and force an election on whether to move the seat of government to Marfa. The election resulted in a victory by Marfa's supporters in a tally of 391-302 for a margin of 89 votes out of 693 cast. The following Commissioners Court meeting was held in Marfa and, despite many absent commissioners, ordered the transfer of county records from Fort Davis to Marfa. Despite the intransigence of some Fort Davis officeholders, the seat was effectively moved to Marfa housed in rented spaces there. Litigation would continue into the following year when the Texas Supreme Court would ultimately decide that, while the relocation of the county seat to Marfa did not carry the two-thirds majority required by state law, recommended that the Legislature divide the county recognizing increasing agitation to do so both in Fort Davis and in Murphyville, now known as Alpine. The Legislature dutifully complied with the court's recommendation and carved Presidio County into several new ones including Jeff Davis in 1887. The newly created counties, however, were immediately saddled with their pro rata share of their parent county's debt. Furthermore, Presidio County insisted that the new counties were responsible for paying for their share of the debt on its new Presidio County Courthouse. To add insult to injury, the new Jeff Davis County found the Fort Davis courthouse, which had sat dormant for two years since the removal of the previous county seat to Marfa, to be a shell of its former self with the building's fixtures and furniture also carried off along with its former official records. The courthouse retained its iron jail cells, but remained as inadequately small and in need of reparation as it had before. By 1910, the need for a new courthouse had become eminent. Numerous repairs, including repeated patching of the roof, had been regularly necessary. Two windows, heavily barred, had been added to the west wall of the upper cell housing women and less threatening prisoners for light and ventilation. Eventually jail facilities became so intolerable that all prisoners required transport to the Presidio County jail for detention, and the building as a whole was seen as being beyond further repair. After completion of construction on the replacement courthouse and the new separate jail building in 1911, the steel cell from the original courthouse was salvaged for use in the new jail, while dirt from the demolition of the old adobe courthouse was used for leveling the grounds of the new courthouse and jail yard. =Present courthouse= In May 1910, county securities at six percent interest were issued to pay for the new courthouse and separate county jail to be paid with a 25-cent per $100 property tax. The architectural firm L.L. Thurman & Co. of Dallas, who would soon after design the current Henderson County Courthouse in Athens, was selected to design the courthouse and jail facilities at a cost not to exceed $6,000. Strips of land adjoining the south and east sides of the previous courthouse property were purchased from W. Keesey to extend the courthouse square to the entire block of the street grid. By August, the county would accept a $47,000 bid from Falls City Construction Co. of Louisville, Kentucky to construct the courthouse at the center of the newly expanded square immediately southeast of the previous facility. The new jail was built concurrently directly south across Woodward Ave. from the square. The jail, no longer used for that purpose but since serving in recent years for county offices, is itself a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. Construction of both the courthouse and jail were finished in early March 1911, and their completion was celebrated with a community dance in the courtroom on March 13. Once county offices had vacated the previous courthouse and jail, bids were accepted for the demolition of the previous facility. After construction debts were paid, the special tax was rescinded in May 1920. Currently, State St., which conveys both state highways passing through Fort Davis and which runs along the east of the square, serves as the town's principal street. In earlier years, however, Front St. along the west side of the square performed that role as that street was historically the route of the Butterfield Overland Mail through town. The ground floor of the new courthouse featured six offices each of which was heated with its own fireplace, a large room for Commissioners Court meetings, and a fire-proof vault for archiving county records. The second floor held the courtroom, more offices, a jury room, and a barred detention cell. A many-cupped chandelier lighted the courtroom from its high ceiling. At that time, the judge's bench was merely a flat-topped desk and chair. The half-story third floor served as little more than an attic with stairs leading to the clock tower. The 1910-model Seth Thomas clock with faces at each of the building's four sides was a pendulum-driven device constituted of metal-coated wooden gears and two rock-filled wooden boxes acting as weights. Maintenance required someone to climb three flights of steps plus two ladders weekly for winding. A bell for striking the hours was also used as a fire signal and designated as an alert, if necessary, during the Mexican Revolution and World War II. The clock resulted in a $1,700 additional expense to the building despite problems with accuracy or even displaying the same time on its four faces. Installed shortly after the building was completed were hail screens to protect the windows and acetylene gas lights utilizing a pressurizing machine in the new jail yard. Although a water well was drilled in the jail yard, the courthouse did not have running water, toilets, or a septic tank until May 1914. Subsequently, a men's restroom was installed on the ground floor while a single women's toilet was placed in the second floor as women were not widely seen as participants in county government before passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. Over the years, most changes to the courthouse amounted to mere maintenance such as adopting to new technological and public utility standards including electrical lighting, telephone, water, and sewer service. Fireplaces had been replaced by distillate stoves requiring the building's dozen chimneys to be raised by to properly draw air, but these caused soot-stained rainwater to discolor interior walls. In a throwback to the problems plaguing the previous courthouse, the county was constantly needing to replace leaking roofs in the new building. Between 1939 and 1941, an arboretum containing mostly native flora was planted on the square. The arboretum landscaping was authorized in 1938 as a Works Progress Administration program. It was not until the 1950s that the courthouse undertook major renovations. In 1955, the distillate stoves were replaced with butane heaters allowing the chimneys to be reduced to roof level while the roof was also replaced. In 1956, the roof would be replaced again for the fifth or sixth time since the building's completion in 1911. New flooring was installed in the courtroom and some offices, and the courtroom ceiling was lowered for acoustics and heating. In the courtroom, theater-style seating was installed while the upper gallery was removed. A new plywood bench for the judge and a jury box with matching railing were built. The stained glass window behind the judge's bench was boarded and plastered. Downstairs, exterior steel doors were installed, and a counter shelf was built for the office of the sheriff and tax-assessor collector along with five fire extinguishers provided for the premises. In 1957, two gas heaters with electric blowers were installed in the space formerly occupied by the courtroom's upper gallery to heat the courtroom. The building's roof would require replacement in 1974 and again 1975. Between 2002 and 2003, the courthouse underwent a major restoration that involved, not only electrical, mechanical and plumbing improvements as well as necessary accessibility enhancements such as the installation of an elevator, but also the correction of many architecturally insensitive modifications undergone previously. These included restoring the balcony and original furnishings in the courtroom and faux wood and metal ceiling finishes throughout the building. Exterior improvements included repairs to doors, windows and masonry, a new metal shingle roof, sheet metal repairs to cornices, and renovation of the clock tower. These renovations were performed at a cost of $2.8 million supported by a THC grant of $2.3 million with the remainder supported by local funding. The grant was administered as part of the THC's Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program, created to support counties preserve their current and former historic courthouses after the state's historic courthouses were included in the 1998 listing of most endangered historic places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

They were constructed in 1923 on the site of Watkin's Tower in Wembley, and came to be recognised as one of the iconic symbols of English football in general and of Wembley Stadium in particular. They became grade II listed buildings in 1976, but they were demolished in 2003 to make way for the new Wembley Stadium.  Construction  The towers were designed by Sir Robert McAlpine for the construction of Empire Stadium (later known as Wembley Stadium) in time for the British Empire Exhibition on the site of the demolished Watkin's Tower. They were high and built out of ferro-concrete with concrete flagpoles topped with concrete crowns constructed above them. Initially they were only intended to be a temporary construction, and the plan was to demolish them after the exhibition, but the chairman of the exhibition committee Sir James Stevenson requested that they be preserved. The towers continued to remain a part of Wembley Stadium and they became a distinctive symbol of Wembley, framing the approach to the stadium from Wembley Park tube station to the north. They were world-famous as the landmark symbols of Wembley Stadium. The Twin Towers were granted Grade II listed status in 1976. As they were originally built as temporary structures, and were \\"treated to resemble masonry\\", several alterations were required over the years to preserve the Twin Towers.  Demolition  In 1994, there were rumours that Wembley Stadium would be redeveloped to build a new English national stadium. English Heritage responded critically to the reports, writing to Brent London Borough Council stating that they expected the Twin Towers to be preserved but would not object to the rest of the stadium being demolished. In 1998, the Football Association considered plans on how to update Wembley and replacement was considered the best option, despite an offer from Arsenal F.C. to buy the stadium and restore it. When the new designs were unveiled, it was announced that the Twin Towers would be demolished to make way for the new 90,000 capacity stadium. The reasons given to English Heritage were that they would be in the middle of the pitch of the new stadium plans and served no practical purpose. The Minister for Sport, Tony Banks described them dismissively as \\"concrete blocks\\". It was also claimed that it would be impractical to move the towers elsewhere because the ferro-concrete would crumble easily and unevenly, making it impossible for them to be dismantled and reassembled somewhere else in any solid form. English Heritage opposed the demolition and Brent London Borough Council stated that they would not approve any new stadium that did not include the Twin Towers. Brent Council later granted planning permission on the understanding that the Twin Towers would be preserved, however the final designs for the new stadium reverted to the originals without the Twin Towers in place. English Heritage also withdrew their objections, thus paving the way for the Twin Towers to be demolished. Proposals in early 2000 to move the towers to Widnes, to become part of a new national rugby league museum, were not realised. The Twin Towers were the last structure of Wembley to be demolished. Preliminary demolition work started in December 2002 with the concrete crowns being removed from the top of the flagpoles. The towers were demolished in 2003 by a large Liebherr 974 crawler excavator referred to as \\"Goliath\\", made in Germany specifically for the task. The original foundations of Watkin's Tower were rediscovered during the demolition. The top of one of the towers was moved to be installed as a memorial at St Raphael's Estate, Neasden, and the \\"iconic\\" tower flagpoles are now located at the late Sir William McAlpine's Fawley Hill estate.

Plot Opening quote: \\"He sang a sweet song in tones so full and soft that no human ear could resist them nor fathom their origin...\\" (Source: The quotation is inspired by, but not actually from \\"The Garden of Paradise\\".)) In a flashback 6 months ago, a L√∂wen named Don Nidaria (Phillip Keiman) kills his Mauzhertz wife, Katherine (Erica Sullivan) in an attack of rage. In the present, Don's lawyer, Barry Kellogg (Brian T. Finney) uses his powers to spread a dust into the jury, which includes Rosalee (Bree Turner) and causes them to agree with his statements. Nick (David Giuntoli) gives Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) his permission to show Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) the trailer. In the trailer, Juliette is confused by the books and weapons found. Suddenly, she begins seeing Nick's flashes to when he was trying to show her the Grimm world. Monroe finds Rosalee sick for the events in the court and decides to find out what's happening. He attends the trial and witnesses a witness change her testimony. He then follows Kellogg to the bathroom and watches him eat a toad and discovers he is a Ziegevolk. Nick, Hank (Russell Hornsby), and Monroe attend the next hearing. They see Wu (Reggie Lee) change his testimony after persuasion from Kellogg. In the spice shop, Rosalee seems to have found a cure but the antidote requires Kellogg's sweat. Along with Bud (Danny Bruno), Nick, Hank and Monroe make a facade to get his sweat by having Monroe chase after Kellogg, who is \\"saved\\" by Bud and then given a handkerchief to get his sweat and finding where he is staying. The next day, Nick and Hank distract Kellogg while Monroe sneaks into his hotel room to inject his toad the antidote. However, he finds two toads and is forced to choose which one of them to inject. Meanwhile, in Vienna, Adalind (Claire Coffee) meets with Eric (James Frain) to discuss Renard's (Sasha Roiz) failure to get the key, prompting Eric to decide to visit his brother. In the court, the jury finds Don guilty, shocking Kellogg. That night, while celebrating their victory, Monroe is visited by Kellogg in the spice shop, looking for an antidote for his condition.

Bojani dedicated her life to strict austerities as an act of repentance and devotion to God and was known to have visions of angels and demons. The confirmation of the late Bojani's local 'cultus' (or popular devotion) allowed for Pope Clement XIV to approve her beatification in 1763. Life Benvenuta Bojani was born in the Republic of Venice in 1254 as the last of seven daughters. The midwife declared she was a girl to her father's disappointment - who wanted a son - but instead said with part cheer: \\"She too shall be welcome!\\" Bojani was baptized in her name for it meant 'welcome' due to her father's words at her birth. Bojani refused to participate in childhood games that dabbled in worldliness or vainness for she remained a pious child devoted to the service of God rather than to the secular world. But one vain older sister tried and failed to teach her to dress in rich clothing and indulge in pleasures that her sister refused to do. In 1266 she began to wear a hair net and a rope girdle as signs of austerities she began to undertake but as she grew the girdle began to cut into her and had to be removed. The girdle could not be removed because it was far too embedded for it to be untied but after turning to God the rope fell to her feet. In her adolescence she became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic and lived her entire life at home to continue practicing her austerities. Bojani became ill due to long periods of fasting and lack of sleep and was confined to her bed for five years and had to be carried to Mass; one kind older sister carried her to church at least once a week for the celebration of compline. During the celebration of Mass on the eve of the feast of Saint Dominic near the tomb of the saint in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna the saint himself - alongside Saint Peter - appeared to her and she was healed during the Mass. Bojani saw the saint's face take the place of the prior's face when compline commenced; the saint then went to his tomb and disappeared while the Madonna came down the aisle with the Infant Jesus and blessed all priests present. This moment of apparitions was when she was healed of her ailment. Bojani received angelic and demonic visions and could banish the demons after mentioning the name of the Madonna. Bojani died on 30 October 1292 and was interred in the church of Saint Dominic in her hometown. Beatification Her beatification received approval from Pope Clement XIV - on 6 February 1763 - after the pontiff confirmed the longstanding local 'cultus' (or popular devotion) to the late religious.

It was first released on August 2, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux, and was later released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on March 22, 2017, and for Nintendo Switch on October 24, 2017. In the game, the player controls the protagonist Jack Boyd, who is being forced into early retirement by the corrupt mayor. The game takes place in the fictional city of \\"Freeburg\\" in 1985, during Boyd's final one hundred and eighty days on the force. The game received mixed reviews. The game was followed up by a sequel - This Is the Police 2 - for the same platforms in 2018.https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/31/this-is-the-police-2-delves-into-the- morals-and-politics-of-law-enforcement/ A mobile version of the series is made by HandyGames with the same gameplay in 2019, with the sequel in March 2020. A spinoff, Rebel Cops was released on mobile in August, 2020. Gameplay The isometric map of Freeburg, which helps the player solve crimes This Is the Police is a real-time management video game where the player controls protagonist Jack Boyd, a police chief in the game's location of Freeburg set to retire in one hundred and eighty days. The gameplay is presented via imagery and text on an isometric map. The player is tasked to make $500,000 in his final six months on the force, through various ways which the player chooses; one of the options include utilizing the local mafia. The mafia may ask the player to turn a blind eye towards some of the crimes and be rewarded with money, or if they wish to stay alive. The player receives calls and they are tasked to prioritize certain ones while dealing with staffing. Depending on the severity of the calls, the number of police sent varies. If it's a case of assault, only two police need to go, but if it's an armed robbery, ten may need to go. As the game progresses, the player is able to send SWAT Teams and reinforcements. The player must strategize about how many officers they send to each crime, because if there are no spare officers, some crimes cannot be stopped. Failure to stop crimes results in the player's squad and pay being reduced. Later on during the game, the department's officers will start taking sides between the two main political figures, Mayor Rogers and Robespierre. The political views of the player's officers are unknown unless they make one of them a rat, which increases the likelihood of mistrust and the death of the officer while docking some of said player's pay in order to recompense that officer for his information. Sending out squads of officers with differing political opinions degrades unit cohesion, causing more failures unless groups of officers with similar morals and values are sent to the scene of the crime. The game also features crime investigation gameplay, where the player must piece together what happened leading up to a crime and capture the criminal. The endgame features an assault on their political ally's rival and involves strategical placement of units. Story Jack Boyd, the 60-year-old police commissioner for the city of Freeburg, is being forcibly retired by corrupt Mayor Rogers after Francis Kendrick, Boyd's deputy, was accused of corruption charges that in spite of being dropped have irrepairably damaged their reputation. Boyd gives himself 180 days to build a retirement fund of $500,000, but suspects he can't make the money legitimately. Later Kendrick asks him to become an inside man for the mafia and depending on Jack's accepting the offer, Kendrick either escapes or is murdered along with his family. Boyd becomes Sands' new inside man, and weighs the risk of openly defying the mob while remaining true to his personal morals. A new gang calling themselves the Vargas soon arrives in Freeburg, defying Sands' dominance, and both Sands and Vargas ask for Boyd's support in the conflict. Eventually either the Vargas or Sands take control of the criminal underbelly of Freeburg, with the help of the player. Meanwhile, Boyd's wife has disappeared, running off with a younger man. Her mother helps Boyd track her down, and a personal investigator helps to find her lover. However, on the day of the meeting, Jack is struck by an unknown assailant and enters a coma. He then suffers a nightmare about being corrupt. Shortly after the gang war and Jack waking up from his coma, Robespierre gives out vital information about the surviving crime family and gives Jack a limited time window to bring them to justice; otherwise he will kill the head of the reigning gang personally as a favor to Freeburg. He reveals himself to be Eugene Chaffee, a wealthy businessman who wants Jack's assistance. In turn he offers to be an informant for Jack in gauging the opinions of the city. Later, a serial killing case arises, where several victims of sexual assault by Mayor Rogers are found to have been killed by the Dentist, an infamous serial killer who eluded Freeburg's authorities, with Jack being forced to work behind the backs of law enforcement to find the killer. Jack deduces that Chaffee was responsible for creating a copycat killer as a means of exposing Mayor Rogers' connection to the victims, as they are unwilling to speak out. Chaffee takes Jack to his slaughterhouse and threatens Jack not to betray him. Jack then turns to his relationship with Lana Berman, a prosecutor who was raped by Rogers who wants to prosecute Jack on corruption charges. Despite Jack's attempts to explain things to her, he fails and they sever their relationship. Jack overdoses and is hospitalized from the stress of the events. His return to the police department reveals that an election has been going on and Chaffee plans on running for Mayor despite the likelihood of the results being rigged, as political tensions break Freeburg. Near the end of the 180 days, Boyd faces City Hall and must support one of two candidates to become the city's mayor - the incumbent Rogers, or campaigner Eugene \\"Robespierre\\" Chaffee. Rogers intends to rig the election, but Chaffee wants to overthrow him, creating a progressive Freeburg. However, Rogers promises Jack a chance to keep his career if he chooses to kill Chaffee instead. With few options left and wanting to keep his job, Jack works with one of them. On the day of the raid, Jack received news that his wife has passed away and he attempts to process the grief of being alone. If sided with Rogers, Boyd storms Chaffee's restaurant and kills him. Boyd is still fired, but keeps all the money he earned over the course of the game. If sided with Chaffee, Boyd storms City Hall and Mayor Rogers is killed. Boyd will still be fired from his position, but receives money from Chaffee to last \\"the rest of your life\\" - one dollar. Going to his local club, he learns that his membership was permanently revoked and with no one left in the city who he trusts, Jack laments on the bitter defeat he has suffered. Development and release A Kickstarter page for This Is the Police was created in January 2015. The initial goal of $25,000 was surpassed, with a total of $35,508 being raised. Jon St. John, the voice actor behind Duke Nukem, portrays Jack Boyd, the protagonist of the game. This Is the Police was shown at the 2016 PAX East gaming convention. The game was planned for release on July 28, 2016, but was delayed five days due to a publisher error. THQ Nordic's European distributor Koch Media later confirmed that a port of This Is the Police would be coming to the Nintendo Switch. The Nintendo Switch version became available for download from the Nintendo eShop on October 24, 2017, and became available for retail on December 5, 2017. Reception This Is the Police received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to the review aggregator website Metacritic, based on 35 critic reviews. Reviewers praised the game's plot and design. Alex Gilyadov (GameSpot) said the plot was gripping, as well as praising the game's design. Juan Garcia (IGN) praised Jon St. John's voice acting, the visual styles and said it had a good plot. Caitlin Cooke commended the gameplay mechanics and the game's design. Kate Gray (PC Gamer) said the game looks and sounds \\"gorgeous\\". Reviewers disliked the repetition of the game and the narrative. Jeff Cork (Game Informer) found himself bored of it halfway through. Caitlin Cooke said that after the first 20 in-game days, she \\"felt dragged along with little direction or thought\\". Brent Ables (Kill Screen) mentioned that by day 100, he started to lose sight of the game's goal. Kate Gray said the game became dull and boring after the first couple of hours of playing. Juan Garcia disliked how the game was too focused on the narrative and how that impacted the rest of the experience. Edward Smith of the International Business Times said that \\"This Is The Police is simultaneously a rich video game and a poor depiction of its subject matter\\". He noted how due to the various controversies surrounding police in the United States that happened around the release date, he believed the game was bound to be criticized.

Athletics career  Seaward originally started running for St Malachy's Athletics Club. When he moved to England, he started to run for Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club in Wales. He represented Ireland at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the marathon but finished 64th. In 2018, Seaward represented Northern Ireland at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. He finished fourth in the marathon with a time of 2:19:54. In 2019, Seaward ran the fastest time for an athlete representing Ireland since 2002 with a 2:13:39 in the Berlin Marathon. This time was outside the Olympic qualifying time, which led to suggestions Seaward might have to rely upon his IAAF ranking in order to qualify. However in 2020, he ran a 2:10:10 at the Seville Marathon. This broke the record for Northern Irish marathon runners and gave Seaward an Olympic qualifying time. Seaward attributed his time to the Nike Vaporfly trainers he had been wearing for the marathon compared with the Adidas Boosts he had on his feet for the Berlin marathon, despite admitting he hated the feel of them the first time he wore them. As his time made him the second fastest marathon runner representing Ireland in history, it was speculated that he would be selected to represent Ireland at the 2020 Summer Olympics in one of their three marathon places. However the COVID-19 pandemic led to the postponement of the Olympics.  Personal life  Seaward attended St Malachy's College in Belfast. Away from athletics, Seaward is a PE teacher and assistant headteacher at Martin High School in Anstey, Leicestershire, England. When he was at the 2016 Olympics, one of his pupils also went to the Olympics, as a part of the Great Britain team as a Team GB youth archery ambassador.

Giglia came to note as a cyclist during the 2016 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships where she won gold medals in the Individual Pursuit and Time Trial events becoming double world champion and setting new world records in both. Personal history Giglia was born in 1985 in Kent, England and spent her early life in Stratford-upon-Avon before moving to Manchester. In 2013 Giglia worked as a multi-sport coach, specialising in teaching rugby and gymnastics. After suffering from several fainting spells at work she sought medical advice that revealed blood in her spinal fluid. Further tests showed a bleed on her brain which required surgery. Initially attempts were made to insert fine coils into her brain, but when this failed she underwent a craniotomy. She awoke from the surgery after a two-week induced coma with the loss of function the right side of her body, reduced speech and memory loss. A month after her operation Giglia was admitted to an intensive rehab facility. Although feeling positive at the unit, Giglia discovered the extent of her disability on returning home, as she found simple everyday tasks difficult to complete independently. A few months later she was diagnosed with epilepsy, she and her partner split up and Giglia fell into a depression. She left her home and spent three weeks sleeping on her friends couch, before a talk with her friend's mother, who had terminal cancer, placed her life into perspective. In a 2015 interview, Giglia stated that \\"She made me rethink things. I had to do something for me. She gave me back that focus. She told me she wanted me to find a sport and be the best I can be.\\" Cycling career After deciding to turn her life around, Giglia researched several sports to join and attended a para-cycling selection camp for women. A year on from her stroke she was classified as a C3 athlete and was accepted on to the British Cycling Paralympic Development Programme. Over the next six months she progressed through the Great Britain talent scheme until she progressed to the Academy in October 2014. Giglia was selected for the Great Britain team at the 2015 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Apeldoorn. She finished just outside the medal positions in both the C3 500m time-trial (4th) and the C3 individual pursuit (4th). She was then selected for the 2015 UCI Para-cycling Road World Championships in Nottwil in Switzerland; but again failed to medal with two fourth places in the time trial and the road race. The year ended with a major break-through for Giglia when she beat the reigning world champion, Denise Schindler, in the C3 individual pursuit. In 2016, in the buildup to the Summer Paralympics in Rio, Giglia entered her second World Championships. There, at Montichiari in Italy, she won gold in both the C3 500m time-trial and the individual pursuit setting new world records in both events. On the first day of the 2016 Rio Paralympics, Giglia won the women's 3000 m individual pursuit (C3), Great Britain's first medal of the Games. Giglia was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to cycling.

The episode revolves about an attack of a burglar but discover that he is in fact Roy Harper (Colton Haynes), who is being extorted by a man named The Calculator, who is assembling devices to develop a bomb. Meanwhile, Thea continues to fall under the effects of the Lazarus Pit and her bloodlust, but Nyssa may have found an answer for her problem. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising Roy's return and The Calculator's performance in the episode. Plot On Lian Yu, Reiter tortures Oliver to know about the maps while Taiana is forced to watch. Suddenly, everyone in the room is shot down by someone with a bow and arrow, revealed to be Shado. She frees him but they both acknowledge that they're in Oliver's hallucination for his injuries. She tells him that he needs to forgive himself for what he has done by freeing the darkness inside him and to tell Taiana about killing Vlad. When he regains consciousness, he confesses to Taiana that he did in fact killed his brother. This causes Taiana to suffer a breakdown. Five years later, Nyssa escapes from her confinement in Nanda Parbat with the help from Mesi Natifah and escapes with some loyalists to her. In Starling City, the team goes after a burglar. However, when Thea catches to him, she falls unconscious and the burglar escapes. In the hideout, the team deduce that this is a side effect of her bloodlust for not having killed anyone on a long time. Meanwhile, Felicity needs to make a presentation in Palmer Tech but fails to get the recognition from the board committee. Malcolm visits Thea and tells Oliver that Thea needs to kill her killer, but as Ra's is dead, Thea needs to kill someone else or she will die. The burglar appears again and this time, Oliver catches him but discovers to his shock that the burglar is Roy. With his surprise, Roy escapes, the team convinced he is somehow brainwashed. Meanwhile, Oliver is notified by Alex that Ruv√© Adams is running for mayor, causing Oliver to confront her as the Green Arrow. The team discovers Roy's next move is to steal a device from Palmer Tech. Roy shows up in Palmer Tech and attacks Curtis until Oliver knocks him out with an arrow. In the hideout, they find a camera len in his eye and remove it. Roy wakes up and states that in Hub City, he was being extorted by someone called \\"The Calculator\\" to commit crimes for him or he would reveal his identity to the world. In Kyushu, Nyssa goes to retrieve the lotus from Tatsu, who was assigned to protect it. They engage in a sword fight but as they're equally skilled, Tatsu gives up and gives her the lotus, stating there's something concerning Oliver. Roy visits Thea but then, she begins to cough and Ra's wound begins to emerge from her chest. Malcolm manages to avoid the extension of the wound. Felicity attempts to decode the identity of Roy's extortionist but the Calculator is aware of their intention and using a voice cover, expels them from the system. However, Felicity and Oliver discover that he was hired to download a nuke throughout the network and kill people and is the main reason for coercing Roy to get the devices needed. Finding the location of the placement of the bomb, Oliver, Roy, Diggle and Laurel infiltrate and take down the terrorists. However, the bomb needs to be activated so the damage is collateral, otherwise, it will affect the city. Roy decides to stay behind and activate the bomb while the rest escape. Using an arrow, Roy escapes in time just as the explosion takes place. Felicity also manages to send a virus to the Calculator's computer, erasing Roy's history. Felicity manages to make the presentation in Palmer Tech, receiving an ovation from the public. One of the attendees is the Calculator, who speaks with Oliver, unaware of his identity. The Calculator later appears to Felicity, who calls him her father. Thea slips into a coma and Oliver is told by the doctor that Thea may never recover. He is then visited by Nyssa, who explains that she has the Lotus, an elixir that can reverse the side effects of the Pit and she offers to give it to him for Thea, on the condition that he kills Malcolm. Production On November 20, 2015, Marc Guggenheim revealed that the 12th episode for the fourth season would be titled \\"Unchained\\" and was to be directed by Kevin Fair and written by Speed Weed and Beth Schwartz. Preparation ran from November 10 until November 19, 2015. Shooting ran from November 20 until December 3, 2015. Reception =Ratings= The episode was watched by 2.48 million viewers with a 0.9/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. =Critical response= \\"Unchained\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode an \\"amazing\\" 9.4 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"While the prospect of Roy Harper returning to Star City was exciting, it was impossible to predict just how well this week's Arrow would turn out. 'Unchained' fired on all cylinders, offering a healthy blend of banter, action and dark character drama. Haynes delivered a great performance as he helped give his character more closure, but he was far from the only actor to shine this week.\\" The A.V. Club's Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Unchained' is a grand cavalcade of returning guest stars, with one very addition to the show's mythos. Roy is the star attraction here, considering he was once a series regular and all. The episode recaptures precisely what Roy represented for Arrow during his tenure, all of which boils down to three key elements. First, there's the parkour, now and forever, and I deeply appreciate Arrow going to the trouble of giving us the most Roy Harper- ish reintroduction possible with his various chase sequences. Second, there's his relationship with Thea, which was one of the show's strongest elements when it was still finding itself back in the first season and gave both Willa Holland and Colton Haynes space to define their performances and create a compelling subplot that had little to do with Oliver's activities.\\" Andy Behbakht of TV Overmind gave the episode a 3.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"Despite that many of my favorites, including Roy, returned for this episode, 'Unchained' felt it was a little all over the place, despite how smoothly a lot of things came together in the end. But despite of that, it was fun to see so many old faces, especially with Roy who, despite the trouble he had gotten into thanks to Calculator, felt a lot more mature and grown-up this time around.\\" Jonathon Dornbush of EW stated: \\"Oliver Queen has a tendency to hang onto things. He lets the weight of the world rest on his shoulders so often it's amazing he still has such great posture. And 'Unchained,' both in its present-day and flashback scenes, is about Oliver coming to terms with the idea that he can't control everyone else's life. Try as he might, they're still people in their own right, who are allowed to make their own decisions instead of letting the Green Arrow to decree the course of their lives.\\" Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.25 star rating out of 5.0, stating: \\"That could have been much better. From fan reactions online, I don't expect this to be the popular opinion. Which isn't a surprise. But as a storytelling device, Arrow Season 4 Episode 12 was all over the place. It was an hour of moments rather than a truly good episode of television. And, yes, there were a lot of moments during 'Unchained.' Some of them very good, thankfully.\\" Noel Kirkpatrick of TV.com wrote positive about the episode, stating \\"The pleasure in 'Unchained,' at least in contrast to 'A.W.O.L.,' was that it wasn't about setting up and then delaying gratification. Instead, it ended up an entertaining first installment of a stealth two-parter, which, by the way, is the best way to do two-parters. It prevents the first part from being boring exposition delivery and deck chair arranging for the fun stuff in the next part.\\" References External links  2016 American television episodes Arrow (TV series) episodes Television episodes set on fictional islands ","title":"Unchained (Arrow)"},{"id":"51250291","text":"Vadim Vladimirovich Anokhin (, born 2 January 1992) is a Russian male √©p√©e fencer.

Falcone had a rough call to religious life after several entries and exits into the order and he later served as a noted preacher across southern Italian cities such as Catanzaro and Salerno after his first few sermons attracted little following. He became titled as both the \\"Angel of Peace\\" and the \\"Apostle of the South\\". Falcone became known for ecstasies during the celebration of Mass and was known for converting the hearts of thousands when he went about preaching. The friar possessed the gifts of visions and bilocation and was invited to start preaching in the Neapolitan region at the behest of Cardinal Francesco Pignatelli. He received beatification from Pope Leo XII on 18 December 1825 after being titled as a Servant of God in 1778 under Pope Pius VI and Venerable under Pope Pius VII on 17 June 1821. He is a patron of Acri and of missionaries. Pope Francis approved his canonization and it was determined at a gathering of cardinals on 20 April 2017 that Falcone would be named as a saint; the canonization was celebrated in Saint Peter's Square on 15 October 2017. Life Luca Antonio Falcone was born in Cosenza on 19 October 1669 to Francesco Falcone and Diana Enrico ‚Äì poor parents of humble and pious stock. He had an uncle who was a priest. Falcone received the sacrament of Confirmation on 24 June 1674. In 1684 he met a charismatic friar ‚Äì Antonio da Olivadi ‚Äì from the Franciscans proved to be decisive for him in realizing and pursuing his call to the religious life. He was admitted into the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in 1687 and was clothed in the habit in 1688 but a few months later returned home after the rigorous life frightened him. He believed at this time that he was being called to settle down and enter into the sacrament of marriage rather than pursue the religious life; his priest uncle encouraged this belief. He decided this was not for him and re-entered on 8 November 1689 but ‚Äì after being scared once more ‚Äì fled back home. On his knees before a Crucifix he begged: \\"Assist me with Your grace!\\" He requested for readmission for the third and final time on 12 November 1690 and began his novitiate. His theological studies spanned from 1695 until 1700. He completed his novitiate on 12 November 1691 at 6:00pm and made his profession to the novice master Giovanni d'Orsomarso while being elevated into the diaconate on 18 December 1694. He was ordained to the priesthood in the Cassano all'Jonio Cathedral on 10 April 1700. He consecrated each hour as a priest to some aspect of the Passion of Jesus Christ. He led a Lenten sermon in 1702 in the town of San Giorgio Morgeto at the behest of his provincial and began to address his people but could not remember what he was to continue with and so was forced to leave the pulpit confused. The Cardinal Archbishop of Naples Francesco Pignatelli soon learned of Falcone's prowess in 1711 and called him to preach in Naples and the surrounding areas that composed the archdiocese. He struggled with his first three sermons ‚Äì which all turned out to be miserable ‚Äì with people laughing at him at the first and almost no one at the following two. The worried parish priest begged Pignatelli to find another but the cardinal refused and put his trust in Falcone. At the fourth sermon more people turned up and at the end he asked the people to turn their hearts and minds to one who would soon die among them; as the people left a well-known man died of a stroke ‚Äì who led opposition to his preaching ‚Äì leading to his sermons gathering greater numbers. Overcoming this challenge led to him becoming a famous and sought after preacher. People requested him from all over in southern Italian cities and was known for the conversion of the hearts of thousands of people; he preached in places such as Taranto and Montecassino. His preaching earned him the two monikers of the \\"Angel of Peace\\" and the \\"Apostle of the South\\". He served as provincial father from 1717 until 1720 and was made general visitor in 1735; he served as novice master several times. Falcone possessed prophetic gifts as well as being able to receive visions while he possessed bilocation and could see into men's souls in the sacrament of confession. In 1724 he began construction of the convent of Cappuccinelle which opened on 17 June 1726. Falcone died on 30 October 1739 at the convent he was stationed at in Cosenza; he had become blind six months prior but regained his sight enough to continue to recite the Divine Office and celebrate Mass. His remains were relocated in the 1890s to the Basilica del Beato Angelo d'Acri ‚Äì a church constructed in his honor. Canonization The beatification process commenced in the local diocese on 10 October 1744 while the formal introduction for the cause came under Pope Pius VI on 22 May 1778. The process culminated on 17 June 1821 when Pope Pius VII named Falcone as being Venerable after confirming that the late friar had indeed lived a model life of heroic virtue. The recognition of three miracles attributed to his intercession on 20 November 1825 allowed for Pope Leo XII to preside over his beatification on 18 December 1825. The miracles involved: * the cure of Marianna Bernaudo from Bisignano * the cure of Pietro Sacco from Bisignano * the cure of Francesco Sirimarco from Sant'Agata d'Esaro The fourth miracle ‚Äì the one that would be definitive for full sainthood ‚Äì was investigated in a diocesan process from 14 March 2014 until 15 December 2014 before it later received validation from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints sometime later. Medical experts advising the C.C.S. met to discuss this miracle (after five previous sessions of other doctors examining it) approved the miracle on 15 December 2016. Theologians likewise approved this sometime later as did the C.C.S. before it was taken to the pope for his approval. Pope Francis approved this miracle on 23 March 2017 thus confirming that Falcone will be canonized in 2017; the date was formalized at a gathering of cardinals on 20 April. Falcone was proclaimed as a saint on 15 October 2017 in Saint Peter's Square.

It was one of two indigenously developed tank designs, the other being the cruiser Sentinel tank. While the LP1 Chassis 160 was only developed as a light tank prototype, the Sentinel and Thunderbolt were put into production. None of the two Australian developed tanks saw combat.  Background  Australia in 1941 saw the need to produce its own military vehicles, as their normal source, the United Kingdom, could not spare the vehicles because of their own war effort needs. This saw Australia produce a number of armoured cars, and both a light tank and several cruiser tanks. The first effort to create a tank in Australia was the assembly of a light tank, in 1941. 160 Carrier, MG (Aust) No.1 or LP1 were built with the last two, number 159 and 160, being experimental vehicles for developing the LP2 carriers. Number 160 being formally identified as \\"MG Carrier LP1 Track Displacement-Closed Front\\". Chassis 160 was subsequently rebuilt into a light tank with new suspension and a rudimentary cylindrical turret on top of the body for testing. The tank as constructed, however, was found to be completely unmanoeuvrable and a total failure. The project was promptly terminated.Melbourne Tank Museum exhibit information plaque Plans were drawn up for the AELT to be armed with a 2 pounder gun, a 6 pounder gun, and later, when it was started to be produced in Australia, the 25 pounder gun-howitzer much like the AC3 Thunderbolt. The tank would have been able to achieve a speed of about 48 km/h. The tank was of welded construction, with the envisaged turret of a similar polygonal shape to the Crusader tank and the Rhino Heavy Armoured Car. Like the Rhino, the armour thickness was 30mm. Little else is known about the tank. With increased tank production overseas Australia was able to get access to US-built tanks, and British Matilda II tanks became available after being replaced in British service by later tanks, such as the Churchill. Visually, the light tank is based on local pattern carrier components, with four wheels per side individually sprung on a Watt's linkage. The upper hull and cylindrical turret are of indigenous design.  Surviving example  There is only one example of the Australian experimental light tank. It was previously on display at The Melbourne Tank Museum, owned by John Belfield. The Museum was closed down and the contents were sold off, the tank was for sold for $6215. Its whereabouts are now unknown.

He previously performed under the name Talvihorros. He has released two albums, under his own name and five as Talvihorros. His most recent, Heat & Entropy (2016) appeared on Ba Da Bing Records while his previous outings appeared on Denovali and Hibernate Records. He has performed live globally. Besides his own work, Chatwin does bespoke music for adverts such as Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton, Tate Modern and Volkswagen. Career Chatwin was born in Portsmouth and began to explore music as a teenager. He moved to Brighton in his late teens to study Digital Music, while recording the self-released \\"It's Already on Fire\\" demo . Upon completion of his studies in 2004 he relocated to London. After playing in a number of bands, he began to use the name Talvihorros (meaning hibernation in Finnish) for his music in 2008. In 2009 the album Some Ambulance was released on Benbecula Records and featured Chris Howarth on bass. I was recorded in the winter of 2007‚Äì2008 using a modest budget in Hackney. After signing with the German label Denovali, Chatwin released And It Was So in 2012 with the help of Christoph Berg (violin), Oliver Barrett (cello), Jordan Chatwin (percussion) and Anais Lalange (viola). The album used the Book of Genesis as inspiration, resulting in \\"a near-perfect and wholly unique album\\" according to brainwashed.com. In January 2014, Chatwin released the fifth and last album under the Talvihorros name. A collaboration with Daniel Crossley of Fluid Audio, Eaten Alive chronicles Crossley's drug addiction. It was described as \\"restrained\\" with \\"muted melancholia\\" in comparison with previous albums. During the summer of 2014, Chatwin performed at a number of festivals, including Incubate and the Denovali. Towards the end of 2014, Chatwin moved to Edinburgh and began to record under his own name, noting that the \\"change coincided with a big life change in that I moved from London to Scotland\\". A year later, he released the album The Sleeper Awakes, inspired by the H. G Wells novel of the same name, on Village Green Recordings. It featured contributions by William Ryan Fritch (vocals, strings), Maarten Vos (cello), Joel Hanson (dulcimer) and Sarah Kemp (violin). It was described as \\"skilled at crafting a mood that continually evolves and shifts focus across the album's ten pieces\\". Chatwin lives in South Queensferry. He works closely with his brother, London-based percussionist and graphic designer Jordan Chatwin. Together with his brother he was briefly a member of the rock band Inca Gold. Style Chatwin's work is instrumental. He draws inspiration from the Radiohead release OK Computer, the work by Mogwai and electronica of Autechre. He uses unusual musical instruments such as a dulctione and a 3-string diddley-bow. Other influences include Steve Reich.

ETO manage a key role in Senior Management Team and reports directly to Chief Engineer. Unlike other marine engineers, the ETO does not carry out an assigned Engine room \\"watch\\" instead they are normally on call 24 hours a day and generally work a daily shift carrying out electrical and electronic maintenance, repairs, diagnosis, installations and testing. Some shipping companies do not carry Electrical Engineer Officers / ETO on their ship to cut down the manning cost, and the electrical duties are carried by a Marine Engineer - usually the Third Engineer. However, this situation has changed a lot and many companies have realized that modern electrical and electronic systems require an extra attention and therefore require an expert to attend them. This is especially true on diesel-electric ships or vessels equipped with sophisticated systems such as dynamic positioning. As the technology advances, more automation and electronic circuits are replacing conventional and electrical systems. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) amended STCW 95 (also known as the Manila Amendment) on June 25, 2010, to introduce the certified position of Electro-technical officer in place of Electrical officers in order to make modern Electrical Engineers competent to understand complex and sophisticated electrical systems. On larger vessels such as cruise ships or specialized offshore DP vessels, Electro-Technical Officers can have ranks within their profession, such position names include, lead ETO, 1st Electrician, chief electrical officer or chief electrical engineer. In this situation, the highest ranked Electro Technical officer will report directly to the chief engineer. On special class ships such as FPSOs the Electro Technical officer can sometimes earn top dollar due to the complexity of systems on board, however generally this person is also expected to have additional qualifications which specialise in process engineering, instrumentation and control.

Its entrance was formed by the collapse of the long cave's ceiling, carved out by the waters of the Pivka River. The first excavations were carried out by Franco Anelli from 1933 to 1939. He excavated both in the cave and in front of it and found many Palaeolithic artifacts and numerous faunal remains, although this work remained mainly unpublished. Systematic recording of the archaeological sequence was begun anew by Sreƒçko Brodar from 1947 to 1953.

However, much of the material in the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene sediments found by Anelli is of limited value for scientific research and cannot be put into its correct stratigraphic context because the excavation records of these layers have been lost. The oldest strata are attributed to the warm Mindel-Riss interglacial period followed by the Riss glaciation period, that consisted of rock debris mixed with loam and pieces of sinter. In it proto-Mousterian stone tools and the fossilized bones of a Deninger's bear have been found, dated to an age of 300,000 years. The next strata of red loam and debris contained faunal bone fossils from cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), wolf, the Alpine marmot, Merck's rhinoceros, the cave hyena, wild boar, and elk. The stone tool assemblage discovered in this stratum has been assigned to the Homo neanderthalensis Mousterian culture. The following strata also held Pleistocene faunal remains, particularly those of the Alpine marmot, of reindeer and cave bear. The presence of these fossils points to a deposition during the last glacial period, the W√ºrm glaciation, which lasted from 110,000 to 11,700 years ago. This layer included numerous tool flakes created through flint knapping by Neanderthal occupants and modern humans, who account for the few tools of the Gravettian culture. The uppermost stratum includes Neolithic tools and the fossilized bones of wild boar, wolf, and beaver, whose presence suggests the establishment of the most recent Holocene climate. The top coat of this stratum carried Bronze Age and Iron Age tools, artifacts, pottery shards, and the skeletal remains of domesticated animals. Betal Rock Shelter has been declared a monument of local importance of Slovenia and was added to the national Register of Immovable Cultural Heritage under number 859 on December 22, 1984.

These approaches have been incorporated by many healthcare providers, including Partnerships in Care , St Andrew's Healthcare and the UK National Health Service (NHS). In his early career he was known for being the first psychologist professionally employed in top flight English football, and one of a handful of psychologists involved in the aftermath of the Piper Alpha disaster. William Davies, along with John Gardner, also became the first professional psychologists in English top flight football when Sir Bobby Robson employed them as consultants in 1981 at Ipswich Town F.C.. They then went on to work with Graham Taylor during his successful spell at Watford F.C.. (At the time both teams included England internationals in Mick Mills, Terry Butcher and Paul Mariner for Ipswich, and John Barnes and Luther Blissett for Watford.) In the late 1980s Davies was one of a handful of psychologists and psychiatrists heavily involved over a two-year period in seeing many of the survivors of the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster, mainly for assessing and quantifying any posttraumatic stress disorder. Davies has written various books, articles and textbook chapters. One of his books is Overcoming Anger and Irritability which has been selected to be included in Reading Well Books on Prescription, a series of books managing a variety of mental health conditions which are endorsed by health professionals and supported by public libraries throughout the UK. Davies studied Psychology at University College London (graduating in 1972) and obtained his Doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the University of Birmingham in 1982.

Plot The story starts with Padre who tells his boy Pablo about how donkeys aren't stubborn after Pablo is frustrated with the attitude of his donkey Cupido, who is doing nothing to work for him. So Padre tells the story that happened many miles from where they live in El Camino Del Notre Old Mexico. Small One was an old donkey who belonged to a woodcutter, whose son was kinder to him. One day the boy's father tells him to sell Small One to the tanner as he feels there is no use for him, as he is too old to work. The boy insists not to take him to the tanner's, but his father tells him not to cry over a donkey. The boy realizes there's no use arguing, so he goes off to town to sell Small One, but doesn't tell his father that he will sell him elsewhere. The first place he sees is an auction, where the bidder is selling horses. The boy asks the bidder to sell his donkey, but the bidder refuses and he and the crowd make fun of Small One which upsets the boy; the boy then sets off to see who else would buy him. The boy and Small One both feel hopeless by sundown, and decide to go to the tanner's after all. Just then, the boy meets a nice man, who asks him if he can buy Small One, as he and his wife have a long way to go and she isn't very well. The boy sells the man Small One for one piece of silver and hurries to the gates before the guards close it. The boy promises Small One that when he grows up, he will buy him again and keep him. The man explains to the guards at the gate that his name is Joseph, his wife's name is Mary and they are heading to Bethlehem, so they make their way into the distance. In the end the boy says his last goodbyes to his friend, and Small One, as told by Padre, made it all the way to Bethlehem with Joseph and Mary and saw the king being born; despite how he was made fun of, he became part of the Christmas miracle. In the end, Pablo and Padre listen, wondering whether it was a donkey's hooves or to the sound of the church bells rehearsing the chimes for Christmas morning, but only Cupido knew what it really was.

She was the first to publish a detailed description of autistic symptoms in 1925. The original paper was in Russian and published in German a year later. Sula Wolff translated it in 1996 for the English-speaking world. She initially used the term \\"schizoid psychopathy\\", \\"schizoid\\" meaning \\"eccentric\\" at the time, but later replaced it with \\"autistic (pathological avoidant) psychopathy\\" to describe the clinical picture of autism. The article was created almost two decades before the case reports of Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner, which were published while Sukhareva's pioneering work remained unnoticed. This is possibly because of various political and language barriers at the time. Her name was transliterated as \\"Ssucharewa\\" when her papers appeared in Germany, and the autism researcher Hans Asperger likely chose not to cite her work, due to his affiliation with the Nazi Party and her Jewish heritage. Biography Sukhareva was born in Kiev to the Jewish family of Chaim Faitelevich and Rachil Iosifovna Sukhareva. Between 1917 and 1921, she worked in a psychiatric hospital in Kiev. From 1921, she worked in Moscow, and from 1933 to 1935 she was leading the department of Psychiatry in Kharkov University (Kharkov Psychoneurological Institute). Sukhareva studied autistic children, and described them in a way which has been compared to the modern description of autism in the DSM V. She helped open schools for autistic children where they participated in multiple activities, such as gymnastics, drawing, and woodwork. In 1935, Sukhareva founded a Faculty of Pediatric Psychiatry in the Central Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education. In 1938, she led a clinic of childhood psychosis under the Russian SFSR Ministry of Agriculture and Food. For many years, she worked as a councillor and leader of the Psychiatric Hospital of Kashchenko in Moscow. Sukhareva believed that for personality disorders to appear in children and teenagers, a significant social factor was required. Some of the factors she discussed for personality disorders were a poor family environment and societal structure. She was a pioneer in using the method of suggestion, and fought for children's rights, stating that difficult children should not be sent to labor camps, but to medical institutions. She also studied PTSD from war injuries sustained by children. By order of the Moscow Department of Health, the Moscow Scientific and Practical Center for Mental Health of Children and Adolescents was named after Sukhareva, with the prefix G. E. Sukhareva appended to the front. The center is the leading specialized medical institution for the treatment of suicidal states in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

Their sister or half-sister, Agnese Ghisi, married Othon de Cicon, who became the lord of Karystos on Euboea. In ca. 1239 Geremia, aided by his brother Andrea, expelled another Venetian nobleman, Marino Dandolo, from his fief of Andros. Dandolo died soon after, but his widow and sister brought a complaint before the Great Council of Venice, which in August 1243 ordered Geremia to restore Andros to the Dandolo heirs on pain of banishment from Venice and the sequestration of his and Andrea's properties there. Despite this decree, Geremia retained control of Andros until he died some years later. The island then reverted to the Duke of Naxos, Angelo Sanudo, but the affair continued to be a cause of dispute in the courts of Venice between Andrea Ghisi, the Sanudi, and the Querini claimants of the Dandolo inheritance, until the early 1290s, when Duke Marco II Sanudo bought out the claims of Niccol√≤ Querini on Andros. After Geremia's death, his relative Filippo Ghisi (married to Geremia's daughter Isabetta) seized control of Geremia's original fiefs until the Byzantines under Licario reconquered them in 1277 and took Filippo prisoner. Another daughter of Geremia, Marchesina, married the son of Doge Jacopo Tiepolo and future Doge (1268‚Äì75), Lorenzo Tiepolo.

History A parish church likely dedicated to the Virgin was present at the site before it was elevated to the dignity of a collegiate church in 1530. It was assigned to the Oratory of St Phillip in 1664. This medieval church was razed and led to the construction of this Baroque edifice in 1671 under the direction of Giovanni Battista Contini, who had trained in Rome. The fa√ßade dates to the earlier building. The interior has an elliptical layout, recalling some of Borromini's projects in Rome. The sacristy also has a centralized octagonal plan. Instead of chapels, there are two side altars. The ceiling is frescoed with two medallions depicting scenes from the life of the titular saint: a St Philip in Adoration of the Virgin and a Glory of St Philip. The nave also has allegorical depictions of the Theological Virtues, and depictions of the Doctors of the Church and Evangelists. Paolo Marini painted Old Testament Stories, and the Fathers of the church. He also painted the altarpiece depicting the Madonna, the Trinity and the Guardian Angel on the first altar on the right. The altarpiece of the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa of Avila (1688) was painted by Carlo Cignani.Tourism office of Macerata, by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Provincia di Macerata, entry on the church.

The same year he took part in the inaugural edition of the Summer Youth Olympics. In the individual event he won the gold medal after being led 9‚Äì14 in the final by Germany's Nikolaus Bodoczi.

In the 2013‚Äì14 World Cup he climbed his first World Cup podium with a bronze medal in the Vancouver Grand Prix. He was then called up into the senior Italian national team for the 2014 European Championships. In 2015 he took part in the inaugural edition of the European Games in Baku. In the team event, Italy lost to France in the semifinals and met Switzerland for the bronze medal. Fichera was chosen to close the match against Switzerland's Fabian Kauter. At 38-38 the match went into extra time. After Kauter struck a hit, the referee erroneously gave the match to Switzerland. The Italian delegation appealed, pointing out the correct rule.

The name \\"Kushim\\" is found on the Kushim Tablet, an Uruk Period (c. 3400‚Äì3000 BC) clay tablet used to record transactions of barley. It is uncertain if the name refers to an individual, a generic title of an officeholder, or an institution. Uruk Period tablets Writing in the ancient Sumerian city Uruk was time-consuming and literacy was likely limited at the time. Therefore, writing was mainly used for essential record-keeping. The \\"Kushim Tablet\\" is a clay tablet detailing a trade transaction and one of the first examples of rebus writing. It reads \\"29,086 measures barley 37 months Kushim.\\" This may be interpreted as having been signed by \\"Kushim.\\" Kushim's name appears in 18 separate clay tablets from the period. Another Uruk Period clay tablet that featured names dating back to around 3100 B.C. includes the names of a slave owner (Gal-Sal) and their two slaves (En-pap X and Sukkalgir). This tablet was likely produced one or two generations after the Kushim Tablet. Identity Kushim is believed to have been either an individual or a generic title of an officeholder. The cuneiform characters \\"KU\\" and \\"≈†IM\\" were not presented with much context, and therefore it is difficult to determine whether such sign combinations denote an individual, their office, or an entire institution. Kushim was responsible for the production and storage of beer. Some of the tablets charge the distribution of barley to several officials as various debits, with the summation on the reverse as a single credit for the discharge of Kushim's liability. One relatively simple account shows the charging of various amounts of barley to three officials on the obverse, while Kushim was credited for the total amount distributed to the officials on the reverse. However, the reverse could also be interpreted as Kushim's account. Other tablets are more intricate, showing the input of various ingredients on the obverse (malt, etc), while showing different kinds of beer as output on the reverse side. One tablet shows Kushim providing 14,712 liters of barley to four officials, for which he was properly discharged.

Opened in 1921 as Camp Wyoda, its property was acquired by the Aloha Foundation in 1997, and is now operated by that organization as a day camp for local children and vacationers staying in the area. Camp is divided into three two-week sessions; activities include water sports, land sports, and arts and crafts. The camp property, organized around a former farmstead, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 for its well-kept collection of surviving early camp architecture. Facilities Aloha Horizons Camp is located on the northern shore of Lake Fairlee, near the mouth of Middle Brook. The camp's are divided by both Vermont Route 244 which parallels the lakeshore, and Middlebrook Road, which follows the stream uphill. Most of the camp buildings are located west of Middlebrook Road and north of VT 244, with athletic facilities east of Middlebrook and the waterfront area south of VT 244. Its main buildings, including the Main Building, Infirmary, Arts & Crafts Building, and Nature Building, date from the camp's first two decades, and are built in the Adirondack Rustic style. The waterfront includes a boathouse and a bleachers for watching events. with Camp Wyoda was founded in 1916 by Harvey and Margaret McLean Newcomer, and was first located in leased facilities on Passumpsic Point, east of the present location. In 1921, the Newcomers purchased the 19th-century Thompson farmstead, as the camp had outgrown the first facilities. Traces of the Thompson farm buildings exist in the Main Building and Arts & Crafts Building, both of which were extensively rebuilt in 1947.

Bagnesi remained confided to her bed for most of her life after falling ill upon receiving news that her father arranged a marriage for her - she escaped this fate but remained in her room where people flocked to seek her counsel. Due to her devotion to Bartholomew the Apostle she assumed the name of \\"Bartolomea\\" and added it to her name as a sort of middle name. The confirmation of the late Bagnesi's longstanding local 'cultus' (or popular devotion) allowed for Pope Pius VII to approve her beatification in 1804. Life Maria Bagnesi was born in Florence on 15 August 1514 - the Feast of the Assumption - to Carlo Bagnesi and Alessandra Orlandini. Bagnesi was a neglected child and her mother often left her in the care of others which included one of Bagnesi's sisters who was a nun from the Order of Preachers so she spent most of her childhood in her sister's convent. Four of her sisters would end up in the religious life. Her father organized a marriage for her when she turned seventeen and she fainted in horror upon learning this. The thought made Bagnesi so ill she could not walk and was thus confined to her bed. Her father turned to con men and charlatans - for he could be manipulated with ease - and put his daughter through over three decades of non-stop \\"treatment\\". Being bedridden meant that she could not follow her sisters into the religious life but she nevertheless became a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in 1544 and made her profession in 1545; she made her profession into the hands of and received the habit from Vittorio di Mattheo who allowed for this to take place in Bagnesi's room. After she professed she found that she could get out of her bed for brief periods of time. The combination of asthma and these quack treatments immobilized her just as she began to heal and she started to have visions and converse with angels and demons alike. Neighbors began to believe she was under demonic possession and summoned a local priest - who became her spiritual advisor who assured the locals she was not possessed or in need of an exorcism. People also claim to have seen her levitate. She was also granted the special privilege of having Mass celebrated in her room at times. Her room soon became a place for pilgrims to go to in order to seek her wisdom and counsel and her room became a place for cats to roam - some remained with her and even slept on her bed while guarding her pet songbirds. Bagnesi developed a deep devotion to Saint Bartholomew the Apostle and she assumed the name of \\"Bartolomea\\" as part of her actual name as a sort of middle name. She also came to know Saint Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi and shared her visions with her; the saint would herself be cured due to Bagnesi's intercession on 16 June 1584. Bagnesi received the Eucharist three to six times a week and prepared beforehand with docile care and spent the time following her reception of it in deep reflection. Her confessors were the priests Alessandro Capocchi and Agostino Campi. Bagnesi died in Florence in 1577 and at the end of her life five priests present at her deathbed read to her one of the Gospel accounts of the Passion of Jesus Christ. Her remains were taken in procession for her funeral from Santa Maria Novella to Santa Maria degli Angeli where she was interred. Her remains are incorrupt. Beatification Painting depicting her funeral. Her local 'cultus' (or popular devotion) received confirmation on 11 July 1804 allowed for Pope Pius VII to approve her beatification. Her liturgical feast is celebrated on an annual basis on the date of her death - or her 'dies natalis' (birth into heaven).

It was listed as one of eight films that could be the German submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards, but it was not selected. Plot A Yenish boy named Ernst Lossa is transferred to a mental institution, where he labors under the watch of Dr. Veithausen. Ernst, initially identified as a troublemaker, lives up to his role and frequently rebels in minor ways. He does not plan to stay in the institution long, but expects to be taken home (and eventually to America) by his father, Christian Lossa, but is denied discharge based on the fact that his father has no permanent address after being released from a concentration camp. Initially, certain patients in the hospital are marked to be sent to the Hadamar Euthanasia Centre, where they are euthanized, but central authorities dictate that the euthanasia operation and decisions be transferred to individual institutions, leaving Dr. Veithausen to direct his nurses to execute patients under their care. The newly hired nurse, Sister Kiefer, has transferred from Hadamar and is willing to exterminate child patients using barbiturates. Meanwhile Sister Sophia tries to protect the children from being poisoned. Ernst befriends Nandl, a fellow patient, and over time they become aware of Dr. Veithausen's plans to execute the patients in the institution. He attempts to work out an escape plan to save Nandl and himself. The doctor, following the logic of racial hygiene, devises a plan to starve patients slowly by feeding them boiled vegetable soup with all nutrients removed, which satisfies his Nazi superiors. Not long after, Ernst plans his escape during an air raid, but he fails when a bomb drops nearby and the falling debris injures Nandl and kills Sister Sophia. After the nurse's funeral, Ernst accuses Veithausen of being a murderer. Dr. Veithausen calls for Ernst's death, which is carried out by either Paul Hechtle or Sister Kiefer (both deny being the killer). Nandl breaks the news to the other patients by claiming that Ernst has finally made it to America.

It includes more than , including the entire bowl-shaped valley where the village is located. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The village itself, now a Vermont state park, was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1965. Description and history The Plymouth Notch village is located in a small bowl in the Green Mountains of central Vermont, just east of the junction of Vermont Routes 100 and 100A. The bowl is bounded on the north by Wood Peak, the east by East Mountain, the south by Blueberry Hill and Soltudus Mountain, and the west by Mount Tom. with It is traversed primarily by the waters of Pinney Hollow Brook, which rises from the hills surrounding the village and is a tributary of the Ottauquechee River. The eponymous notch is just west of the village, separating it from the valley carrying the Black River. The hills surrounding the lowlands of the bowl are all wooded, while the bottomlands are now a combination of open fields and woods. The village of Plymouth Notch is located at a bend in Vermont Route 100A, which passes to its south and east, roughly paralleling Pinney Hollow Brook. The village of Plymouth Notch was settled by members of the Coolidge family early in its history, and is where Calvin Coolidge was born in 1872. It retained its rural 19th-century character well into the 20th century, and in the 1960s efforts were made to preserve this environment, resulting in the creation of a state park dedicated to Coolidge and the village environment. The park includes Coolidge's birthplace, adult home, and the church where he worshipped.

Some of the historic relics of NTA are: # Pandavan Para (believed to be having 5,000-year-old human inscriptions) # Vizhinjam Cave Temple (constructed by the rulers of the Ay kingdom) # Anantha Victoria Marthandan Canal (constructed during the British rule) # Neyyattinkara's first library Njanapradayini  Times of Travancore Dynasty  Sreekrishna Swami Temple, Neyyattinkara Town founded by Marthanda Varma in 1775Sree Krishna Swami Temple in the town-centre stands as a rare example of merger between legend and reality. According to the legend it was here the Travancore king Marthanda Varma once hid inside the hollow trunk of a Jackfruit tree to escape from his enemies during his war against the 'ettuveetil pillamar' (the eight nair chieftains). The King prayed to Lord Krishna for helping him as he was being surrounded by the enemies. At that time, a mysterious child asked the King to hide himself inside the hollow trunk of a large jack tree standing there. The jack tree popularly known as 'Ammachiplavu' (Grandmother Jack Tree) since then, could still be seen preserved in the Shri Krishna Swamy Temple located in the heart of the town. This temple was built by Marthanda Varma in the year 1755, as a thanksgiving to the Lord Krishna, who helped him to win the ordeal.  Independence struggle  Neyyattinkara is the birthplace of renowned revolutionaries like Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai, Athazhamangalam VeeraRaghavan who fought for Indian independence and against the dictatorial rule of Travancore Diwans. Neyyattinkara is the land of many uprisings against British rule in India. The brutal crackdown by British military resulted in death of many freedom fighters including Veeraraghavan. A monument reminding the new generations of these struggles could be seen in the heart of the town, in front of the Town Police Station. The Father of Nation of India, Mahatma Gandhi, had spent a day at Madhavi Mandiram (name of a house) in Neyyattinkara.

FORREC's clients include Universal Studios, LEGOLAND, Nickelodeon, BBC Worldwide and Six Flags as well as international companies like China's Wanda Group and Chimelong Group, Dubai Holdings, Dubai Parks & Resorts, Meraas Leisure and Entertainment LLC, Singapore Tourism Board and Khazanah Nasional Berhad. FORREC began as a landscape architecture firm in Canada in 1984 and has since added architecture, interior design and graphics disciplines.  Company history  = Pre-FORREC =  1961-1965: Sasaki, Strong & Associates  Japanese-American landscape architect, Hideo Sasaki partnered with Richard Strong to form the Toronto-based firm Sasaki, Stong and Associates in 1961. Working mainly in Canada, they master planned Toronto's Queen's Park Complex and designed Nathan Philips Square.  1965-1970: Richard Strong Associates Ltd.  Richard Strong founded Richard Strong Associates in 1965, but continued to partner with Hideo Sasaki on numerous projects. Together they designed La Ronde, the amusement park for Expo 67 in Montreal.  1970-1973: Merged to form Strong Moorhead Sigsby, Ltd.  Merging with Australian landscape architecture professor, Donald Guy Sigsby, and Toronto-based landscape architect Steven Moorhead, Richard Strong became president of Strong Moorhead Sigsby, Ltd. The firm expanded, with offices in Toronto and Sydney, Australia. As Strong Moorhead Sigsby Limited the group published numerous academic articles and studies, as well as the following books: * Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland, Atlantic Region (1971) * Fathom Five Provincial Park (1973)  1973-1977: Name Change to Richard Strong - Steven Moorhead  Upon Sigsby's departure to start his own firm in Australia, a partnership formed between Strong and Moorhead. Most of the work from these 5 years was based in Ontario. During this time the company focused on urban renewal, recreational land planning, and landscape design for urban parks, like Devonian Square in downtown Toronto. One of their largest projects was The Thunder Bay Waterfront Park Study plan. This 28-page report was well received and was used as the basis of development for years to come. The pair continued to produce industry related books and articles, including: * Ryerson Polytechnical Institute: Landscape Development (1975)  1977-1984: Moorhead Fleming Corban Inc. then Moorhead, Fleming, Corban, and McCarthy  Strong moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1977 and established his practice there as Richard Strong Associates. A series of employee promotions and company mergers adjusted the name and management make-up of the company for almost a decade. In 1978, the firm designed Canada's Wonderland, the country's first major theme park and later, in 1981, the World Water Park at West Edmonton Mall. = As FORREC = The increase of theme park and water park focused work led to the company's final name change in 1985 to FORREC, a shortened version of \\"For recreation\\". The company's business model also became a private limited with share capital. To keep ownership fluid, a policy was created that required shareholders to begin selling their shares at age 60.  1985-1992: A North- American focus  FORREC were hired by USAA Real Estate Company, a subsidiary of the USAA insurance company, and Gaylord Entertainment Company, a company which owned Opryland USA, to assist in the design of a theme park in San Antonio, at the time known as Fiesta Texas. Soon after, Universal Studios hired FORREC to design their theme park in Florida, which opened in 1990.  1992-2013: Global projects  FORREC began doing more international work. They were hired to transform the Beijing National Aquatics Center from the 2008 summer Olympics into a family water park called the Happy Magic Watercube. BBC Worldwide asked FORREC to create a series of prototypes for four of their most famous brands ‚Äì Top Gear, CBeebies, BBC Earth and Walking with Dinosaurs.  2013-Present: Continued growth and mergers  In 2013, Tim Scott and Nolan Natale of Natale and Scott Architects (NASA), joined FORREC, along with their entire team.

It is choreographed as an annual Vaishnavism tradition in Melattur and nearby regions, and celebrated as a dance-drama performance art. The dance art has roots in a historic migration of practitioners of Kuchipudi, another Indian classical dance art, from Andhra Pradesh to the kingdom of Tanjavur. The term Bhagavata, state Brandon and Banham, refers to the Hindu text Bhagavata Purana. Mela is a Sanskrit word that means \\"gathering, meeting of a group\\" and connotes a folk festival. The traditional Bhagavata Mela performance acts out the legends of Hinduism, set to the Carnatic style music. History The origins of the Bhagavata Mela are in Kuchipudi, another more ancient classical Indian dance, found in Andhra Pradesh. The invasion of the region by Islamic armies led to the fall of a Hindu empire, which triggered the mass migration of Hindu performance artist families to Tamil Nadu in 16th century, where the dance evolved into modern Bhagavata Mela. Prior to its fall, the court records of the Deccan region based Vijayanagara Empire ‚Äì known for its patronage of the Indian religions and arts ‚Äì indicate that drama-dance troupes of Bhagavatas from Kuchipudi village performed at the royal court. The region saw wars and political turmoil, ending in the formation of Deccan Sultanates in 16th century. With the fall of Vijayanagara Empire and the destruction of temples and Deccan cities by the Muslim army around 1565, musicians and dance-drama artists migrated south, and Tanjore kingdom records indicate that some 500 such Kuchipudi artist families arrived from Andhra, were welcomed and granted land by the Telugu Hindu king Achuthappa Nayak, a settlement that grew to become modern Melattur near Tanjore (also called Thanjavur). These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela. Kuchipudi declined and was a dying art in 17th-century Andhra, but in 1678, the last Shia Muslim Nawab of Golkonda, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, saw a Kuchipudi performance and was so pleased that he granted the dancers lands around the Kuchipudi village, with the stipulation that they continue the dance-drama. The Shia Sultanate was overthrown in 1687 by the Sunni Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In order to regulate public and private morals, as well as end un-Islamic practices, Aurangzeb banned public performances of all music and dance arts, along with ordering the confiscation and destruction of musical instruments in Indian subcontinent under control of his Mughal Empire. The Deccan region saw wars and political turmoil with Mughal imperial expansion ending the Deccan Sultanates by the end of the 17th century. During this period, more Bhagavatar community families moved south, invited by the newly established Maratha rajas in the Kaveri delta, to settle in and around Kumbakonam. These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela. Repertoire The Bhagavata Mela is traditionally celebrated in Hindu temple grounds or next to a temple, starting after dusk and through the night, and like the original Kuchipudi artists, male Brahmins were the artists who played the role of men and women characters in the underlying story. Modern productions include both male and female artists, and has evolved to show influences of both Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam ‚Äì the main classical dance of Tamil Nadu. Like all classical dances of India, the Bhagavata Mela incorporates sophisticated gestures as sign language combined with intricate footwork and acting (abhinaya) to communicate a religious story with spiritual message. These aspects of the Bhagavata Mela have roots in the Natya Shastra, the ancient Hindu text on performance arts. The performance includes Nritta, Nritya and Natya. The Nritta performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of pure dance. The Nritya is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes. The Natya is a play performed by a team of artists. The roots of abhinaya are also found in the Natyashastra text which describes basic units of dance, the gestures and movements that connect with the audience and aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, and transports the individual into a super sensual inner state of being. The communication in Bhagavata Mela is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) synchronized to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ras (sentiment, emotional taste) and bhava (mood) of the underlying story. Like other Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: Angika (gestures and body language), Vachika (song, recitation, music and rhythm), Aharya (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and Sattvika (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates). Abhinaya draws out the bhava (mood, psychological states). The Bhagavata Mela stories are typically from the Hindu Epics or the Puranas, with Prahlada Charitram being particularly popular. The music is Carnatic style, and most of the underlying story is sung to the rhythm of the music while the dance artists perform. The repertoire is aided by an orchestra of musical instruments, with mridangam (drum) and cymbals providing the beat, and flute, string instruments and harmonium completing the ensemble.

Covering 37 acres surrounding Coventry railway station, once complete Friargate will be made up of 25 new buildings, including 14 Grade A office buildings, two hotels and new homes. The project is scheduled to take 15 years to complete and is thought to be providing 15,000 new jobs at a cost of ¬£100 million. It has been described by the Coventry Telegraph as one of the twelve new developments that will change Coventry forever. The former leader of Coventry City Council, Cllr Ann Lucas, has stated that developments such as Friargate will help the city achieve its aim of being a top 10 UK city. On 10 March 2016 Station Square, the new public thoroughfare created as part of the development, was opened by Cllr Lucas. The space features more than 200 trees, stone benches and seats and was heralded as proof that Friargate is already changing the area. Ownership Two Friargate CGI, with One Friargate in the background Friargate Coventry LLP is the organisation that has been formed to bring forward the development of Friargate. This organisation is the development vehicle for Cannon Cannon Kirk, a Dublin-based property group. Location Friargate surrounds Coventry railway station, covering 37 acres. The new business district will be located to the south of the city, in close proximity to Junction 6 of the Coventry ring road, Central 6 Retail Park and the King Henry VIII School. The extensive, reliable, transport connections have been cited as a key factor in locating development of this scale at the Friargate site. History The modern station has been located on this site since 1962, after it was rebuilt following heavy bombing during the Blitz in 1940, it is now a Grade-II listed building. However, a station has been located on the site since 1838. Office buildings and retail units have also been located on this site since the 1960s, the most prominent of which was Station Tower. This was demolished in October 2015 to make way for the Friargate development, after being deemed no longer fit for purpose and outdated. One Friargate under construction and Station Square, May 2016 Retail outlets located on the site included Shimla Spice, which relocated to new premises in The Butts, Spon End once demolition commenced. A time capsule has also been buried underneath the development, and will be unearthed in 50 years‚Äô time to show future generations what life was like when Friargate was being constructed. The items inside the capsule were chosen by people in Coventry and were buried by pupils from St Osburg‚Äôs, Spon Gate and All Saints C of E primary schools. Coventry City Council Coventry City Council is working in partnership with Friargate Coventry LLP to promote the development, and has agreed to become tenants in the first building in the Friargate Masterplan. The 13-storey, ¬£40 million, building will accommodate Council workers ‚Äì with the existing Council House remaining as a base for councillors and council meetings. Leading councillors praised the design and look of the building, and were reportedly extremely pleased with it. Coventry Council‚Äôs then leader ‚Äì Cllr Ann Lucas ‚Äì commented: \\"For me, this new council house has the wow factor. I like the colour of the building as I feel it is incredibly important that we tie in some of the historical parts of the city to this new development. It obviously needs to be functional, but you also want the new building to be attractive. And as other buildings come along, they will complement each other but be different in design.\\" Completion The Friargate development is a 15-year project. However, the first building was ready for occupation by Coventry City Council in October 2017 https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/news/2010144-construction- completes-inaugural-friargate-building and a planning application for the second building, designed by architects Allies & Morrison, was granted permission on 22 June 2016.

A special double-length episode featuring guest star Uzo Aduba, it was advertised as the 100th episode of the series. (although the very next episode, \\"Beta\\", is the actual 100th episode) It was written and storyboarded by Lamar Abrams, Colin Howard, Jeff Liu and Katie Mitroff. The episode was viewed by 2.153 million viewers. In the episode, Steven accidentally discovers and frees a Gem bubbled within Lion's mane, who is introduced as Bismuth, one of the original Crystal Gems from 5,300 years ago. As her old friends Pearl and Garnet rejoice, Steven eventually learns why Bismuth was kept hidden all these years. The episode aired as part of the \\"summer of Steven\\" event, in which 20 new episodes of Steven Universe aired over the course of four weeks; a clip from the episode was released in advance to promote the event. Plot While in Lion's mane, Steven (Zach Callison) accidentally pops a bubbled Gem that was stored there, which regenerates into Bismuth (Uzo Aduba). Steven brings her out of Lion's mane, and Garnet (Estelle) and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) joyfully introduce her to Steven and Amethyst (Michaela Dietz) as one of the original Crystal Gems, thought lost during the Gem War. Bismuth is dismayed to learn that thousands of years have passed and they are the last of the Crystal Gems. Bismuth takes the Crystal Gems to her forge, where she used to make weapons for the Rebellion. She speaks passionately about her desire to overthrow the \\"upper crust\\" of the Gem Homeworld and allow all Gems the freedom of self-determination. Bismuth gives the Gems upgrades for their weapons, and they all return to the temple to spar. Steven, intimidated by the intensity of the sparring, offers to show Bismuth some Earth traditions: badminton, card games, making pizzas and watching movies. That night, Bismuth reminisces about Rose Quartz. When Steven says that he feels he'll never be able to live up to his mother's legacy, Bismuth tells him he can be someone even better‚Äîhimself. She offers to give Steven a new weapon of his own. Back at the forge, Bismuth shows Steven her masterpiece: the Breaking Point. While Rose's sword can compromise a Gem's physical form without damaging the gem itself, the Breaking Point is capable of shattering a gem in one hit, thus killing them permanently. Steven rejects the weapon, saying its use would make the Crystal Gems no better than Homeworld. Bismuth says that that's what Rose said when Bismuth first showed the Breaking Point to her, and concludes that Steven is just Rose in disguise. They fight, while Bismuth accuses \\"Rose\\" of hypocrisy and not valuing the lives of her followers. At the end of the fight, in despair, Bismuth points the Breaking Point at her own gem and dares Steven to pull the trigger. When he refuses, she turns it around to point at him, forcing Steven to run her through with Rose's sword. Steven promises Bismuth that, unlike Rose, he'll tell the others what happened; her last words are \\"Then you really are better than her.\\" Steven destroys the Breaking Point. Back at the temple, Steven and the other Crystal Gems sadly place Bismuth's gem, bubbled again, in the basement. Broadcast and reception \\"Bismuth\\" premiered on August 4, 2016 on Cartoon Network. Its initial American broadcast was viewed by approximately 2.153 million viewers. It received a Nielsen household rating of 0.56, meaning that it was seen by 0.56% of all households, making it the highest rated show of the night. This was the fifteenth episode of the \\"Summer of Steven\\" event, where a new episode aired every weekday for four weeks. This episode received a great deal of praise, particularly toward Aduba's performance as Bismuth. Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club lauded the episode, giving it an A. Thurm felt there were great character moments in the episode and that the double length helped the audience bond with Bismuth. Furthermore, Thurm felt that the episode was \\"the opening of a floodgate\\" into the experiences of the Gem War.http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/100th-episode-steven-universe-means- bismuth-240483 Vrai Kaiser of The Mary Sue made particular emphasis on the episode's portrayal of the ethical turmoil of war and its inevitability as \\"a means of Steven finally having to draw a line in what he believes that isn't a categorical win\\".http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-recap-bismuth/ References 2016 American television episodes Steven Universe episodes ","title":"Bismuth (Steven Universe)"},{"id":"51252442","text":"Runestone Gs 13 in church in G√§vle.

He was born in Portugal, and ordained in 1871. By the mid-1870s he was working in Macau, and in 1877 he traveled to Portuguese Timor to serve in the Catholic missions there. In 1882, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Goa, and in 1884 he was selected Bishop of Macau. He served in that position until his death in 1897.  Biography  = Early life and priesthood = Medeiros was born on 15 October 1846 in the village of Vilar de Nantes, Portugal, near the city of Chaves. He was the only son of Augusto Lu√≠s Medeiros and Teresa de Jesus Carneiro. Medeiros was ordained a priest in 1871. Following ordination he became a professor at St. Joseph's Seminary in Macau. In 1873 he was appointed prefect and two years later, dean of the seminary. Also in 1875, he was appointed visitor of the Catholic missions in Portuguese Timor, and two years later rose to the position of vicar general. = Missionary work in Timor = He arrived in Dili in 1877 with a team of nine Portuguese priests and one Chinese priest from Macau, all trained at the Seminary of Bonjardim in Portugal. He set about evangelizing the people and reforming the mission. This was prompted by a visit Medeiros made to Timor two years earlier, in which he concernedly wrote to the Bishop of Macau, Manuel Bernardo de Sousa Enes, regarding the state of Timorese Christianity and social institutions, particularly the \\"primitive\\" and \\"immoral\\" state of marriage and the family. Medeiros wrote: > They don't know about family ties. The simplest principles of natural and > moral Law, the social relationships that create a family amongst men: > everything is ignorance, everything is misery amongst these unfortunate > people. When Medeiros took over the missions, the priests set out evangelizing and combating \\"anti-Christian\\" institutions, and were fervent in their targeting of the barlake (Portuguese: barlaque) system in which the chiefs of ruling houses would exchange wives as gifts. \\"The Devil,\\" as one priest dubbed it, was \\"always seeking the loss of souls,\\" a \\"superstitious\\" institution that was seen by the missionaries as the main threat to the establishment of Christianity as the mainstream faith of Timorese society, because it encouraged polygyny and concubinage. To combat this, Medeiros sent written instructions to his missionaries emphasizing the need to celebrate marriages and baptisms amongst the families of the tribal elite. In addition to the native resistance to the missionaries' efforts, Medeiros placed blame on the Portuguese colonial authorities, stemming from his belief in their tolerance and even complicity in the native practices, including barlake. He wrote: > In Timor there circulates as a commonplace the idea that the authorities are > forced to respect the manners and customs of the natives, and therefore they > have nothing to do with the pagan marriages between Christians. If they > simply would do this, it would not be too bad, because the missionaries > would rectify in practice such an absurd error; however, cases have occurred > that demonstrate with clear evidence the very intolerable abuses of some > hinterland authorities who fight against Catholic matrimony between > Christian natives. Medeiros accused Portuguese officers of \\"spreading doctrines contrary [to Catholic teachings]\\" and of blocking missionary efforts. This culminated in 1881 when Medeiros denounced the rape of two young native girls by a Portuguese military commandant and a Timorese noble, further accusing the officer of ordering a native chief to give him his daughters. He also scathingly denounced several military officers who ordered a tribal leader to hand over his young daughter, whom the men had seen in church. Also around this time, comparable accusations of missionary priests having sexual relations with Timorese noblewomen were made by military officers. These counter-accusations culminated around the same time when the Governor of Portuguese Timor, Celestino da Silva, wrote scathing letters to Medeiros as well as the Bishop of Macau, denouncing \\"scandalous\\" cases involving the priests. The tension was so strong between the missionaries and the colonial authorities that Medeiros did at least once consider terminating the mission. Medeiros wrote to the Bishop of Macau in 1881: > [The missionaries] cannot baptize or marry even one r√©gulo, without, for > this reason, suffering threats from the military and even from the Governor; > because of all this they [the missionaries] beg Your Excellency to order > their withdrawal from Timor and their return to Portugal. As for myself I > beg the same, and my wish is to accompany them and go away. Although the Bishop did not appear to heed these requests, the next year Medeiros did indeed leave the missions, leaving a remarkable and widely recognized legacy of a well-established Catholic faith, and education system, in Portuguese Timor. = Episcopacy = On 29 August 1882, Pope Leo XIII appointed Medeiros Titular Bishop of Thermopylae and Auxiliary Bishop of Goa. His consecration took place on 15 August 1883, and was presided over by Archbishop Ant√≥nio Sebasti√£o Valente, Archbishop of Goa. On 4 September 1884, Medeiros was selected Bishop of Macau, and was confirmed on 13 November of that same year. In 1887, he served as principal consecrator of Bishop Jo√£o Gomes Ferreira. He was known to support the work of the Canossians in the diocese, and in 1890 he handed leadership of St. Joseph's Seminary to the Society of Jesus. He spent much of his time visiting far-flung parishes of the diocese, including St. Joseph Church in Singapore and St. Peter Church in Malacca, as well as regular trips to the parishes and missions of Timor.Monsenhor Manuel Teixeira, \\"Bispos, Mission√°rios, Igrejas e Escolas: no IV Centen√°rio da Diocese de Macau\\" (Macau e a sua Diocese, Vol. 12), Macau, Tipografia da Miss√£o do Padroado, 1976; p√°gs. 38, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 e 82Monsenhor Manuel Teixeira, \\"Bispos, Mission√°rios, Igrejas e Escolas: no IV Centen√°rio da Diocese de Macau\\" (Macau e a sua Diocese, Vol. 12), Macau, Tipografia da Miss√£o do Padroado, 1976; p√°g. 40, 41 e 42 = Death and legacy = He died on 7 January 1897, in Lahane, a small town near the city of Dili, Portuguese Timor, at the age of 50.

She worked at a number of sites, but is best known for her excavations at Mucking, a major Anglo-Saxon settlement and associated cemetery, with finds ranging from the Stone Age to the Medieval period. The Mucking excavation, which Jones directed from 1965 to 1978, became Britain's largest ever archaeological excavation. It produced an unprecedented volume of material, although some academic archaeologists have criticised the fact that the results did not appear in print until decades after the excavation had ended. Jones' work at Mucking, as well as her role in founding the campaign group Rescue, was influential in the establishment of modern commercial archaeology in Britain.  Early years (1916‚Äì1956)  Margaret Ursula Owen was born on 16 May 1916 to middle class parents in Birkenhead. She attended Calder High School for Girls in Liverpool before going on to read Geography at the University of Liverpool. At Liverpool, Jones was taught by archaeologist W. J. Varley and volunteered on his excavations of hillforts in Cheshire in the late 1930s. On these excavations she met Tom Jones, another of Varley's assistant excavators (Tom Jones was a member of the university rowing club, which Varley coached), whom she married in June 1940. Jones worked as a postal censor during the Second World War. Afterwards, she and her husband moved to Hereford and made a living as freelance photojournalists; Margaret wrote articles to accompany photographs taken by Tom.  Freelance archaeologist (1956‚Äì1965)  While working as photojournalists, the Joneses continued to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain, and in 1956 Margaret began working as a freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works. At the time the Ministry was responsible for the upkeep of Ancient Monuments and, by extension, the large volume of rescue archaeology required to document archaeological sites before they were destroyed by the postwar construction boom. A small workforce of itinerant archaeologists were employed to excavate these sites in advance of development. Between 1956 and 1965, Margaret Jones directed a number of such excavations in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (including Old Sleaford).  Mucking (1965‚Äì1978)  In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones to conduct an excavation at Linford, a gravel pit near the village of Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by gravel extraction, prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site. The Mucking excavation was to become the largest ever carried out in Britain. To keep ahead of its destruction by the gravel company that owned it, Jones, assisted by her husband Tom, directed work at the site continuously for 13 years. Unusually, they excavated all year round, living in a small caravan and employing a shifting workforce of freelance archaeologists and volunteers from around the world. When it finally completed in 1978, the excavation covered 44 acres and had recorded 44,000 archaeological features, including Beaker burials; a Bronze Age hillfort; an Iron Age settlement and cemetery; a Roman villa and cemetery; one of the most significant Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain; two large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries; and a Medieval field system. It involved 5000 archaeologists and volunteers and recovered 1.7 million finds. As the largest excavation in Britain, Mucking was renowned amongst archaeologists in the late 1960s and 1970s: in its obituary of Jones, The Independent said of it, \\"for a generation of respectable middle-aged archaeologists ... to have dug with Margaret Jones at Mucking remains a badge of honour\\". Many young archaeologists passed through the site, including Mike Pitts, Paul Barford and Monica Barnes. The site was run on a tight budget, and the living conditions there were notorious: Jones herself also gained a reputation as an eccentric and intimidating figure: \\"indomitable, formidable, disinclined to suffer fools but very kind to those she considered worth helping, dedicated and inventive\\". She was known for issuing \\"terse memos\\" signed simply, \\"‚Äìmuj\\".  Later years (1978‚Äì2001)  After completing the excavations at Mucking in 1978, the Joneses retired from field archaeology and returned to their cottage in Hereford. Margaret became the patron of the Thurrock Local History Society (the source of many volunteers to the Mucking excavation) and sat on many other archaeology committees in Essex. In this role she regularly gave lectures, guided tours and talks to schoolchildren across the county. Margaret Jones died on 23 March 2001. In her later years she had suffered from Parkinson's disease, and was predeceased by her husband Tom, who died following a stroke in 1993.  Legacy  Jones' career took place against a backdrop of increasing professionalization and commercialization of archaeology, which Jones herself had a hand in birthing. During her work as a freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works in the 1950s and 60s, Jones saw the rapid destruction of archaeological sites by construction and development, and bemoaned the lack of resources allocated to properly documenting it. Jones and her colleagues were paid only a day-rate for time spent digging and the costs directly incurred, precluding any post- excavation analysis or publication of their finds. Although Mucking was the largest excavation in the country for over a decade, she ran it on a shoestring budget, relying heavily on volunteer labour. In 1973 she was involved in founding the campaign group Rescue, which lobbied for increased government funding for rescue archaeology. This initiative was ultimately successful, increasingly shifting the labour of pre-development excavation from volunteers to professional archaeologists, and culminating in the creation of modern commercial archaeology with the publication of Planning Policy Guidance Note 16 in 1991. According to her obituarist Mike Pitts, Jones also influenced the formation of modern rescue archaeology in Britain by demonstrating \\"dogged salvage excavation on a grand scale\\" at Mucking. Academic archaeologists criticised Jones' work at Mucking as one of the prime examples of \\"excavation without publication\\". They argued that since the primary aim of any archaeological excavation is \\"preservation by record\\", failing to publish the results amounted to destroying the archaeology without purpose, and that it was irresponsible to excavate large areas without the means to properly process and disseminate the results. Indeed, in thirteen years of continuous excavation at Mucking, Jones only published a single, short paper on the results of her trial excavations in 1965. When the project was completed in 1978, despite the huge volume of material that had been recovered, very little had been analysed and none had been published. Ultimately, the final publication of Mucking was undertaken by others (English Heritage and the Cambridge Archaeological Unit), the first volume of which did not appear until 2015, fourteen years after Jones' death. Jones argued that as the site was being constantly destroyed by the gravel extraction on the site, she could not afford to take time out of the year for post-excavation, nor did she have the funding to complete it. Despite her sometimes fearsome reputation as director of the Mucking excavation, archaeologist Monica Barnes considered Jones a role model:  Bibliography   *  References  English archaeologists British women archaeologists Anglo-Saxon archaeologists 1916 births 2001 deaths 20th-century archaeologists English photojournalists Alumni of the University of Liverpool People from Birkenhead 20th-century women writers ","title":"Margaret Ursula Jones"},{"id":"51252653","text":"Rawal is a village in Sultanpur Lodhi tehsil in Kapurthala district of Punjab, India.

Born in Manchester, Shorrocks attended the Oldham Blue Coat School before following his father into the tailoring trade. Influenced by Chartism in his youth, Shorrocks was always involved in trade union activity, and in 1860 he joined the recently founded Manchester Society of Journeymen Tailors. The society suffered from low membership and a lack of funds; Shorrocks was elected as its secretary in 1863, and attempted to increase its activity.Barbara Nield and John Saville, \\"Shorrocks, Peter (1834-86)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.VI, pp.242-245 In 1865, the Manchester Society tried to negotiate an agreed price list with employers, but faced hostility and was unable to reach agreement. Shorrocks organised a strike which quickly achieved most of the union's aims. Enthused by this, he called a national conference of local tailors' societies, held in Manchester in March 1866. The conference attracted a large number of delegates from around the UK, and the large majority formed the Amalgamated Society of Journeymen Tailors (ASJT), with Shorrocks as General Secretary. Shorrocks also negotiated an agreement to work in co-ordination with the rival London Operative Tailors' Association. He led the ASJT through a lock-out in Manchester in 1868, during which he was charged with conspiracy under the Combination of Workmen Act 1859, but was found not guilty. In 1866, Shorrocks was a founder of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council (MSTC), and he supported W. H. Wood in calling the first Trades Union Congress (TUC), held in Manchester in 1868. He acted as the secretary of this first congress, also playing a prominent role in the 1869 congress, after which he was elected to the committee organised to put together a public statement of the TUC's resolutions. He attended most congresses until 1881, and served on the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC in 1873, the Standing Orders Committee from 1877 to 1879 and in 1881, and as vice-president in 1880. During the late 1860s, Shorrocks was a supporter of the International Workingmen's Association, and was prominent in its Manchester and Salford branches, although neither existed long. He subsequently became associated with more mainstream Liberal-Labour positions. Shorrocks was elected as secretary of the MSTC in 1877, serving until 1883, by which point he was in poor health. Despite this, he remained secretary of the ASJT until his death, early in 1886. One of his daughters later married T. A. Flynn, who served as General Secretary of the Tailors in the early 20th- century.Anne J.

The electric power transmission grid of the contiguous United States consists of of lines operated by 500 companies. The electrical power grid that powers North America is divided into multiple wide area synchronous grids. The Eastern Interconnection and the Western Interconnection are the largest. Three other regions include the Texas Interconnection, the Quebec Interconnection, and the Alaska Interconnection. Each region delivers power at a nominal frequency. The regions are not usually directly connected or synchronized to each other, but there are some HVDC interconnections. In the United StatesANSI C84.1: American National Standard for Electric Power Systems and Equipment‚ÄîVoltage Ratings (60 Hertz) , NEMA (costs $83 for access) and Canada,CSA CAN3-C235-83: Preferred Voltage Levels for AC Systems, 0 to 50 000 V national standards specify that the nominal voltage supplied to the consumer should be 120 V and allow a range of 114 V to 126 V (RMS) (‚àí5% to +5%). Historically 110 V, 115 V and 117 V have been used at different times and places in North America. Mains power is sometimes spoken of as 110 V; however, 120 V is the nominal voltage. History In the United States in the 1920s, utilities formed joint-operations to share peak load coverage and backup power. In 1934, with the passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act (USA), electric utilities were recognized as public goods of importance and were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required transmission line owners to allow electric generation companies open access to their networkMazer, A. (2007). Electric Power Planning for Regulated and Deregulated Markets. John, Wiley, and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ. 313pgs. and led to a restructuring of how the electric industry operated in an effort to create competition in power generation. No longer were electric utilities built as vertical monopolies, where generation, transmission and distribution were handled by a single company. Now, the three stages could be split among various companies, in an effort to provide fair accessibility to high voltage transmission. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 allowed incentives and loan guarantees for alternative energy production and advance innovative technologies that avoided greenhouse emissions. In 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported that spies from China and Russia, as well as from other countries, \\"penetrated the U.S. electrical grid and left behind software programs that could be used to disrupt the system.\\" According to U.S. officials, the spies didn't seek to damage the power grid; however they might be able to do so during a war or crisis. Most of the intrusions were detected by American intelligence agencies. North American Electric Reliability Corporation The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) is a nonprofit corporation based in Atlanta, Georgia, and formed on March 28, 2006, as the successor to the National Electric Reliability Council (also known as NERC) which formed in the wake of the first large scale blackout in November of 1965. The original NERC was formed on June 1, 1968, by the electric utility industry to promote the reliability and adequacy of bulk power transmission in the electric utility systems of North America. NERC's mission states that it is to \\"ensure the reliability of the North American bulk power system.\\"http://www.nerc.com/ NERC oversees eight regional reliability entities and encompasses all of the interconnected power systems of the contiguous United States, Canada and a portion of Baja California in Mexico. NERC's major responsibilities include working with all stakeholders to develop standards for power system operation, monitoring and enforcing compliance with those standards, assessing resource adequacy, and providing educational and training resources as part of an accreditation program to ensure power system operators remain qualified and proficient. NERC also investigates and analyzes the causes of significant power system disturbances in order to help prevent future events. Eastern Interconnection The Eastern Interconnection is one of the two major alternating-current (AC) electrical grids in North America. All of the electric utilities in the Eastern Interconnection are electrically tied together during normal system conditions and operate at a synchronized frequency operating at an average of 60 Hz. The Eastern Interconnection reaches from Central Canada eastward to the Atlantic coast (excluding Quebec), south to Florida, and back west to the foot of the Rockies (excluding most of Texas). Interconnections can be tied to each other via high-voltage direct current power transmission lines (DC ties), or with variable-frequency transformers (VFTs), which permit a controlled flow of energy while also functionally isolating the independent AC frequencies of each side. The Eastern Interconnection is tied to the Western Interconnection with six DC ties, to the Texas Interconnection with two DC ties, and to the Quebec Interconnection with four DC ties and a VFT. On October 17, 2009, the Tres Amigas SuperStation was announced to connect the Eastern, Western and Texas Interconnections via three 5 GW superconductor links.High-Temp Superconductors To Connect Power Grids Western Interconnection The Western Interconnection is the other major alternating current (AC) power grid in North America. All of the electric utilities in the Western Interconnection are electrically tied together during normal system conditions and operate at a synchronized frequency of 60 Hz. The Western Interconnection stretches from Western Canada south to Baja California in Mexico, reaching eastward over the Rockies to the Great Plains. Interconnections can be tied to each other via high-voltage direct current power transmission lines (DC ties) such as the north-south Pacific DC Intertie, or with variable-frequency transformers (VFTs), which permit a controlled flow of energy while also functionally isolating the independent AC frequencies of each side. There are six DC ties to the Eastern Interconnect in the US and one in Canada, and there are proposals to add four additional ties.Visualizing The U.S. Electric Grid It is not tied to the Alaska Interconnection. On October 13, 2009, the Tres Amigas SuperStation was announced to connect the Eastern, Western and Texas Interconnections via three 5 GW superconductor links. Texas Interconnection The Texas Interconnection is one of the three minor alternating current (AC) power grids in North America. All of the electric utilities in the Texas Interconnection are electrically tied together during normal system conditions and operate at a synchronized frequency operating at an average of 60 Hz. The Texas Interconnection covers most of the state of Texas. Interconnections can be tied to each other via high-voltage direct current power transmission lines (DC ties), or with variable-frequency transformers (VFTs), which permit a controlled flow of energy while also functionally isolating the independent AC frequencies of each side. The Texas Interconnection is tied to the Eastern Interconnection with two DC ties, and has a DC tie and a VFT to non-NERC systems in Mexico. There is one AC tie switch in Dayton, Texas that has been used only one time in its history (after Hurricane Ike). On October 13, 2009, the Tres Amigas SuperStation was announced to connect the Eastern, Western and Texas Interconnections via three 5 GW superconductor links. Quebec Interconnection The Qu√©bec Interconnection is one of the three minor alternating-current (AC) electrical grids in North America. The Quebec Interconnection covers all of the Province of Quebec and operates at an average system frequency of 60 Hz. It connects 18 systems in the US and Canada to one electric utility company: Hydro-Qu√©bec. It is operated as an independent AC grid for physical reasons. Because of its unique status, it is often functionally considered part of the Eastern Interconnection. The Quebec Interconnection is tied to the Eastern Interconnection with four high-voltage direct current power transmission lines (DC ties), and with one variable- frequency transformers (VFTs) line, which isolate the unsynchronized AC frequencies of each side. Alaska Interconnection The Alaska Interconnection is one of the three minor alternating-current (AC) electrical grids in North America. It is composed of two grids isolated from each other and from the rest of North American grids.

The campus includes on campus housing in the form of dorms for 2,700 residents, academic buildings, a main library, a music library, two astronomy observatories, experimental research stations for alternative and renewable energy, a recreation center, an athletics complex, a student center, an administration center and over 50 acres of athletics fields including the football team Blakeslee Stadium. The Minnesota State Mavericks men's and women's hockey teams also utilize and have administrative space at the Verizon Wireless Center and the All Seasons Arena located off campus.  Campus history  In 1868, the Second State Normal School began in rented space by Professor George M. Gage in the Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Mankato. The idea of a Normal School was conceived in 1858 at the State Legislature, but was sought by local residents long before this. The State began to build a sizeable main schoolhouse building in the Richardsonian Romanesque styling, similar to that of Pillsbury Hall that was later built on the University of Minnesota campus. It was finished in 1869. This building allowed school officials to transition from borrowed space in the Mankato downtown and begin to host collegiate faculty in earnest. This first campus was located amongst the growing edge of the city in the Minnesota River valley. It was during this time that slow growth of additional out buildings were added to campus. This was the beginning of what is now called the Valley Campus. In 1922, the original schoolhouse building burned down despite being built primarily of locally sourced Kasota stone. In 1924, the institution began work on a Jacobethian Revival style building called the Annex. Over time additional space was added onto the Annex including the larger building now called Old Main. Old Main included many different features such as a student union, the original bookstore, administration offices, the first Experimental School, library and auditorium. The building was constructed again of limestone and Kasota stone and consisted of four floors in a rectangular layout, it included large adornments in the stone with the letter \\"M\\" (representing both the city Mankato and the state Minnesota). To this day the Old Main building holds the historic cornerstone along Jackson Street that has a large inscription that reads \\"State Normal School 1868\\". From 1924 to 1977 these buildings stood as the social, academic and administrative heart of the school. As a result of demographic changes after World War II and due large increases in student enrollment. The existing Valley Campus soon became overcrowded. Under the administration of Dr. Clarence L. Crawford, the school began to plan and then construct a new campus high upon the river bluff on the edge of the City of Mankato. The existing Valley Campus could not grow because development in the City had grown all round. The new campus was called the Highland Campus. The Highland Campus was designed at the time to be a modern, medium size campus with room to grow over time. The Highland Campus is the location of the current campus today. It was built using primarily late 1960s modernist style using brick facade with locally mined Kasota stone. As campus operations transitioned up the hill, a tram and buses were used to shuttle students up and down the hill between campuses. By 1977, the administration had formally moved from the Valley campus. The historic buildings from the early century of Minnesota State were sold or donated to private businesses and non-profit organizations. One such former university building is the current Blue Earth County Government Center, another is the site of Blue Earth County History Center and Museum shared with a VINE senior center, and a third is the site of the Southern Minnesota Children's Science Center. Today, Old Main sited imposingly survives on a hillside overlooking downtown Mankato. It is now a senior living center. It serves as a reminder of the institution's history and as a symbol of the school's extensive contribution to education in the community and the State. Current plans show that the University is looking to renew buildings on the current campus by building new centers and removing halls from that period of the 1960s. North Quad The North Area of the campus contains a majority of on campus student housing. It also includes classroom buildings in the Wiecking Center, Children's Place Early Childhood Learning Center, the Earley Center for Performing Arts and others.

The Minnesota State Student Association, the undergraduate student association at Mankato, approved in 2012 a $0.75 cent Green Transportation fee that would allow all students to pay no cost to use the bus system throughout the year. In addition to this, the student association also organizes the Maverick Shuttle a paratransit option and Stomper Express which runs exclusively at night. With the changes to the fee structure for fares, bus ridership doubled in a manner of two years. Because of the small city context that the University is within, there is parking for nearly 5,000 vehicles adjacent to campus.

He was a specialist sprinter who never raced beyond a distance of five furlongs in a racing career which lasted from June 1972 until October 1973. After being narrowly defeated on his racecourse debut he was never seriously challenged again and won his remaining seven races. In 1972 he won the Errol Stakes at Epsom, the Pilgrim Stakes at Goodwood and the Prince of Wales's Stakes at York. In the following year he was undefeated in four starts, taking the Sheffield Handicap at Doncaster, the King George Stakes at Goodwood, the Nunthorpe Stakes at York and the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp. He ended his second season as the top-rated sprinter in Europe. He later stood as a breeding stallion in Europe and Japan with limited success. Background Sandford Lad was a \\"strong, good-looking\\" chestnut horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right foreleg bred in Ireland by Mrs P Grubb. As a yearling he was offered for sale at the Doncaster Bloodstock Sales and was bought for 1,800 guineaas by representatives of C T Olley. He was sent into training with Ryan Price at his Down House stable in Findon, West Sussex. Sandford Lad was from the first crop of foals sired by St Alphage, a sprinter who finished second in the King George Stakes. His dam Hill Queen failed to win a race but produced at least three other winners as well as the broodmare Blue Queen, whose descendants have included Opera House and Kayf Tara. Racing career =1972: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut Sandford Lad contested the Berkshire Stakes over five furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in June and finished second by half a length to Quentilian, a colt who went on to be runner-up in the Middle Park Stakes. He won his remaining three races, all over the minimum distance of five furlongs. In the Errol Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse later in June he led from the start before drawing away in the closing stages to win by five lengths from the filly Miss Slip, later to win the Molecomb Stakes. In the Pilgrim Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July he won by four lengths from Gracious Melody and Brave Lad, conceding eleven pounds to the runner-up. In the Prince of Wales's Stakes at York Racecourse in August he took the lea at half way and won by three lengths and half a length from Starch Reduced and High Fare. In the autumn of 1972 it was reported that Sandford Lad was to be sold to race in the United States but the rumours came to nothing and he remained in training with Price, =1973: three-year-old season= Sandford Lad had some injuries training problems in the eleven months which elapsed between his win at York in August 1972 and his return in the Sheffield Handicap at Doncaster Racecourse in July 1973. Opposed by four moderate opponents he carried top weight of 140 pounds and won by five lengths. At Goodwood he was stepped up in class and started 6/5 favourite for the Group Three King George Stakes in which he was set to receive weight from most of his major rivals. Ridden by Tony Murray he recorded his most important victory up to that point but was not particularly impressive as he won by only half a length from the four-year-old Workboy with Tickled Pink in third and the Temple Stakes winner Saulingo in third. At York in August Sandford Lad, with Murray again in the saddle, started at odds of 4/1 for the Nunthorpe Stakes. Workboy and Saulingo were again in opposition as well as Rapid River (Gimcrack Stakes), Daring Boy (National Stakes, Windsor Castle Stakes), The Go-Between (Cornwallis Stakes) and Balliol (Cork and Orrery Stakes). Sndford Lad gained a narrow advantage at half way and finished strongly to win by a length from Balliol, with The Go-Between in third. On his final racecourse appearance, Sandford Lad was sent to France and started the 1.2/1 favourite for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 7 October. His old rivals Saulingo, The Go-Between and Brave Lad were in the field but his most serious opponent appeared to be the Irish mare Abergwaun (King's Stand Stakes) and the French two-year-old Moubariz. Racing on soft ground for the first time, Sandford Lad led from the start, shook of a challenge from the Portland Handicap winner Supreme Gift and won by two lengths from Abergwaun with Supreme Gift a further two lengths back in third. Assessment In the 1972 Free Handicap, a ranking of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, he was given a rating of 125 pounds, eight pounds behind the filly Jacinth and five behind the top-rated colt Noble Decree. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 121, twelve pounds inferior to Jacinth. In their annual Racehorses of 1972 Timeform opined that Sandford Lad \\"should make a fine sprinter\\" and would probably stay further than five furlongs. In the 1973 Free Handicap for three-year-old he was assigned a weight of 137 Pounds, making him the highest-rated three-year-old trained in England, but behind the French-trained filly Dahlia and the Irish- trained colt Thatch. He was rated superior to the winners of all five of the British Classic Races. Timeform gave him a rating of 133 and named him as their best sprinter of the year. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sandford Lad the twenty-eighth best British or Irish-trained sprinter of the 20th century. Stud record At the end of his three-year-old season, Sandford Lad was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Airlie Stud in County Dublin at a fee of 3,000 guineas. The best of his European offspring included Spindrifter (winner of 13 races as a two-year-old in 1980), Kearney (Cork and Orrery Stakes), Sandalay (Queen Alexandra Stakes), and Chris's Lad (runner-up in the Coventry Stakes) He was later exported to Japan where he sired 66 winners from six seasons at stud. His last season as an active stallion was 1985, and he died on 28 March 1985.

The Hutzel Women's Hospital and the Eleonore Hutzel Recovery Center, both in Detroit, are named in her honor. She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1999. Early life and education Eleonore Louise Hutzel was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1885, the oldest of five children of Titus Hutzel, a businessman and city official, and his first wife, Emma (Brehm) Hutzel. She moved to Detroit in 1910 to study obstetrics at the Women's Hospital and nursing at Harper Hospital. During her time in Detroit, she also worked as a visiting nurse. After completing her nurse's training, Hutzel moved to Chicago, Illinois, to study at what later became the School of Social Service Administration. Harper Hospital and Hutzel Women's Hospital, Detroit Medical Center Career In 1915 Hutzel became the first director of social services for unwed mothers and their families at Detroit's Women's Hospital. In this capacity, she worked on a wide range of their needs, for example championing a program that aimed to provide breast milk to all children who needed it. Hutzel became involved with the Detroit Girls' Protective League (GPL) as a board member. The GPL led to the founding of a Women's Division of the Detroit Police Department that was charged with protecting children up to age 10 and girls up to age 17, as well as handling crimes involving women. In 1922, Hutzel became the first woman to head up the division, then only a year old. The newly appointed police commissioner did not think such a division was needed and gave Hutzel only six months to prove its value. Her success is evident in the fact that at the end of the trial period she was named chief of the Women's Division and a deputy commissioner. Over 40 police personnel reported to her, and her division became a national model of its kind. In 1933, Hutzel published a book, The Policewoman's Handbook, in which she laid out her view of the necessity for linking police work with social services and offered advice for standardizing policies and procedures for women in police work. She covered such topics as investigation, criminal law, patrol work, and the importance of equal pay and equal training for policewomen. It became the standard reference in police departments for the succeeding quarter of a century. In 1939, Hutzel became a trustee of Detroit's Women's Hospital, serving in this capacity for many decades. In recognition of her contributions to the hospital itself, to the city's social services, and to public health, the hospital's name was changed in 1964 to the Hutzel Women's Hospital. It is now part of the Detroit Medical Center. The Eleonore Hutzel Recovery Center, a mental health and substance abuse rehabilitation facility in Detroit that largely serves women, is also named after her. In the 1950s, Hutzel served on a new six-member corrections commissions that took control of Michigan's prison system. Hutzel died in February 1979.

It was broadcast as the premiere episode of its thirty-first series on 27 August 2016, on BBC One, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the show. The special, which is 99 minutes long, was co-written by Matthew Barry and Andy Bayliss, directed by Steve Hughes, and produced by Lucy Raffety. \\"Too Old for This Shift\\" explores the outcome of the cliffhanger broadcast at the end of the thirtieth series, by focusing on the events surrounding the aftermath of the collision involving established characters Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) and her daughter Grace Beauchamp (Emily Carey). The episode centres around the celebrations of Charlie Fairhead's (Derek Thompson) thirtieth anniversary of working in the fictitious Holby City Hospital's emergency department, where the show is set. It also features a helicopter crash outside the emergency department, which causes damage to the hospital. Several actors who have previously appeared on Casualty during its thirty years on air made a cameo appearance during the special, while Ian Bleasdale reprised his role as Josh Griffiths for the entirety of the episode. The episode also marked the return of Cathy Shipton in her role of Lisa \\"Duffy\\" Duffin, following her guest appearances in the thirtieth series. The special also featured character crossovers from sister show Holby City, with Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), Henrik Hanssen (Guy Henry) and Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher (Alex Walkinshaw) appearing in the episode. The episode was watched by 7.20 million viewers and received mixed reviews. Fans of the show praised the episode and demanded it receive an award. Sharon Marshall of The Daily Mirror enjoyed the episode and believed it \\"showcased what Casualty does best\\", while Midlands Air Ambulance Charity branded the episode as \\"insensitive\\". On 6 November 2017, the helicopter crash won the \\"Best Drama Storyline\\" accolade at the Inside Soap Awards. Plot Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) lies unconscious, having been thrown from her car after it plunged over a ravine. Steph Sims (Tonicha Lawrence) watches down from the top of the cliff before driving off. A few minutes later she calls for an ambulance, but is hit by a car before she can. As Connie regains consciousness, she notices Grace Beauchamp's (Emily Carey) shoe in the car. Flames begin erupting from the vehicle. Connie moves towards the car but before she can get to Grace it explodes. Meanwhile, the emergency department prepares to celebrate Charlie Fairhead's (Derek Thompson) thirtieth year at Holby City with a surprise party. The surprise is soon spoilt when Charlie finds former paramedic Josh Griffiths (Ian Bleasdale) in cubicles. Charlie then works to treat patient Sally Hodge (Pam St. Clement). Sally is revealed to have lithopedia after miscarrying her baby during her teenage years. Charlie then visits the pub where a party is held in his honour, with video footage from former colleagues shown to him. Jacob Masters (Charles Venn) becomes concerned for Connie and Grace when they fail to answer their phones; when Steph is admitted to the emergency department, he goes in the ambulance with paramedics Iain Dean (Michael Stevenson) and Jez Andrews (Lloyd Everitt) to the location where she was found. The trio find Connie's burnt out car at the bottom of the cliff. They reach Connie and learn that Grace was inside the vehicle as it exploded, but when Jez searches the vehicle, she is not there. As Iain and Jez search for Grace they find her in a critical condition and call for an air ambulance to escort her to Scottish hospital. As the air ambulance prepares to land outside the emergency department a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land in the parking lot outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail of the helicopter smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace‚Äôs lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.

In addition, former EastEnders actor, Pam St. Clement, made a guest appearance in the story as \\"very grumpy patient\\" Sally Hodge. Production The show's executive producer Oliver Kent and series producer Erika Hossington began planning the thirtieth anniversary episode in 2014. Hossington said in an interview with Digital Spy that they wanted to do \\"something only Casualty could do\\", and that there would be \\"an absolutely massive stunt\\" which would see the hospital itself in jeopardy too. The episode itself was to originally last for 110-minutes,Sources:  however this was later shortened to 99-minutes. In addition to this, it was also reported that the events which took take place in the thirtieth anniversary episode would set up to two years of new storylines. Kent stated that \\"a lot of storylines kicked off in this episode will deliver in the next year or two, and probably beyond.\\" A special soundtrack was recorded by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales for the episode at BBC Hoddinott Hall in Cardiff Bay. Director Steve Hughes stated he \\"couldn't believe\\" that the show was going to attempt a stunt so big. The stunt itself was shot over two days using \\"various stunts, visual effects and rigging teams\\" as opposed to shooting the stunt scene using computer-generated imagery. Although computer-generated imagery was used to add to the practical effects, the team decided to shoot the stunt practically so that the sequence felt \\"terrifyingly real\\". Hughes said the team shot about sixteen stunts over the two days of filming alone. It was announced on 22 August 2016 that the stunt which would air as part of the thirtieth anniversary would be a helicopter crash into the emergency department after an air ambulance collides with a drone.Sources:  Hossington revealed in an interview with Radio Times that the show had been working with the Association of Air Ambulances for over half a year on the storyline. The storyline was also created by the Association of Air Ambulances, who suggested the idea of an air ambulance colliding with a drone. Commenting on the storyline, Hossington said: \\"What you see in this episode is such a complex and unfortunate series of events.\\" Promotion and broadcast Promotion of the anniversary episode began immediately after the closure of the thirtieth series, with a 40-second teaser following the final episode. The trailer featured a party for Charlie Fairhead being interrupted by a serious event, followed by the tagline: \\"On the happiest day, their darkest hour\\".Sources:  * A second trailer, 30-seconds long, was released on 15 August 2016,Sources:  while in the final five day build-up to the anniversary episode, Casualty released daily short trailers on their Facebook and Twitter pages, counting down to the episode. Between the two series, Digital Spy also mentioned Casualty thirtieth anniversary stunt, placing it as the number one moment to watch in their list of the \\"10 big moments that you have to see this week\\", before releasing a teaser article about the episode on the night of its airing, adding that it was \\"an episode you really do have to watch live.\\" The episode was broadcast on BBC One on 27 August 2016 and was available to watch for thirty days afterwards on BBC iPlayer. In addition to this, \\"Too Old for This Shift\\" was made available for digital download via BBC Store on 27 August 2016 in standard definition, with higher definition later made available for purchase.

She founded the first Indian and M√©tis Friendship Centre in Canada to assist indigenous people who had relocated to urban areas with adjustments to their new communities. She edited the native newspaper The Prairie Call, bringing cultural events as well as socio-economic challenges into discussion for native communities. She was the only woman on the Temporary Committee of the National Indian Council, which would later become the Assembly of First Nations, and would become the secretary-treasurer of the organization when it was formalized. She was one of the women involved in the launch of the Kinew Housing project, to bring affordable, safe housing to indigenous urban dwellers and a founder of the Indigenous Bar Association of Canada. She has received the Order of Canada as well as many other honors for her activism on behalf of indigenous people. She was a founder and currently serves on the National Indigenous Council of Elders. Early life Marion Ironquill was born in 1936 on the Peepeekisis First Nation Reserve near Balcarres, Saskatchewan, Canada to Helen and Joseph Ironquill. Her mother was of Cree heritage and her father was Ojibwa. She grew up on her family's farm and attended school ten months of the year at a residential school twelve miles away because there was no school available locally. She graduated from Birtle Collegeate, a parochial institution which left her with a feeling that she did not belong in either the aboriginal world or the non-native world. At the age of 16, she enrolled in pre-med courses at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. After two years of science studies in 1954, Ironquill left school to marry Ronald Hector Meadmore, who would go on to earn fame in the Canadian Football League. The couple had three children, Glen, Neil and Jim. For nearly twenty years, Meadmore raised her children and participated in social projects. Career and activism During this time, in 1959 Meadmore helped establish a gathering place where urban native people around Winnipeg could gather, called the Indian and M√©tis Friendship Centre (IMFC). The center was the first one in Canada and has since been replicated dozens of times. Meadmore worked full-time as a liaison at the IMFC. As the center grew, it established a newspaper, The Prairie Call, which was organized in 1961 as a means of featuring aboriginal writings and notifications of activities. Meadmore, who was the editor of The Prairie Call recognized that it was a means to build a community concerned with the legal and socio- economic issues facing indigenous people and used the paper to discuss realities of urban life as well as human rights issues. Simultaneously, she joined with Telford Adams, A.H. Brass, Joe Keeper, David Knight and George Manuel to form the Temporary Committee of the National Indian Council, which would later become the Assembly of First Nations. The goal was to create a national body committed to both advancement of native peoples and preservation of their identity, where native people could come up with their own solutions to the problems facing their cultures. When the organization's board was formalized the following year, Meadmore was elected secretary-treasurer. In 1970, Meadmore was appointed to the National Council of Welfare. That same year, after witnessing the struggles a friend had in securing safe housing on a limited budget, Meadmore helped launch the Kinew Housing project, under the sponsorship of the IMFC. She and Mary Guilbault were instrumental in both founding the Kinew project and advocating for a social housing policy. Seeking the cooperation of private funding and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), they secured houses at favorable prices. Renovations were completed by indigenous workers, to make the homes livable and safe, and they were then offered to Native Canadians at reasonable rates. Then counselors from IMFC met with tenants to give advice on a range of issues including housing concerns and tips to dealing with employers and the urban environment. Because the housing purchases required use of a lawyer, Meadmore began to think about returning to school, to better understand the legal impact on business and economic development programs. When Meadmore completed her law degree in 1977 at the University of Manitoba, she became the first Canadian indigenous woman lawyer. First working at Legal Aid Manitoba, practicing criminal and family law, Meadmore soon opened Winnipeg's first all-female law firm,https://umlarchives.lib.umanitoba.ca/marion-meadmore-fonds which focused on corporate law. She was one of the founders of the Canadian Indian Lawyers Association, now known as the Indigenous Bar Association of Canada. In 1982, she left the active practice of law and began the Indian Business Development Group to encourage growth in native businesses. Meadmore was one of the founders of the National Indigenous Council of Elders (NICE), which strives to join First Nation elders from across Canada to develop economic programs which will enable Canada's indigenous people to operate without government funding. Because the tribes have trusts in the billions of dollars, and understand the needs of their own communities in a way that the government cannot, they are pushing to be able to manage their own funds and solve their own social problems. Awards and honors In 1985, Meadmore was awarded membership in the Order of Canada. In 2010 she was honored with the title of \\"Grandmother\\" from the Ka Ni Kanichihk service organization, which hosts the annual Keeping the Fires Burning Aboriginal Awards to recognize women who serve as role models for younger indigenous women. In 2014, she was awarded an Indspire Awards laureate designation for law by the Indspire Foundation and the University of Manitoba granted a Lifetime Achievement Award to Meadmore in 2015.

In 1933 he underwent a deep spiritual experiencePhilippe Mottu, Regards sur le Si√®cle, √âditions L‚Äô√Çge d‚ÄôHomme, Lausanne, 1996, 319 pages, , p. 308. which led him to undertake theology studies in Lausanne. There, his Latin professor, Jules Rochat, put him in touch with the Oxford Group, soon to become Moral Rearmament (and currently Initiatives of Change). He was immediately won by the ideas and practice of the Oxford Group. = Moral Rearmament = In 1935, Philippe Mottu meets for the first time Frank Buchman, the Oxford Group's founder who visits Geneva with a team in order to talk to League of Nations delegates. It is the beginning of a lifelong friendship, with its ups and downs, through which the two men will exchange abundant correspondence.Biography on the Vaud cantonal Archives‚Äô site. In 1938, as European nations re-armed for war, Buchman called for 'moral and spiritual re-armament' as the way to build a 'hate-free, fear- free, greed-free world'.History page the Initiatives of Change's website. Enthusiastic, Philippe Mottu became one of the main activists of Moral Reamament (MRA) in Switzerland. In this capacity he participated in numerous MRA actions at home and abroad, particularly the massive meeting of Palais Baulieu in Lausanne in 1937 (10‚Äô000 participants) or the international meeting of Interlaken in 1938. In 1939 Philippe Mottu was called into active service and joined the \\"Army and Home\\" section at the Swiss Army's headquarters, probably at General Guisan's request as the general partly relied on MRA to build up Swiss morale and resistance spirit.Fr√©d√©ric Burnand, \\"Le R√©armement moral, un fil rouge dans l‚Äôhistoire suisse\\", article on Swissinfo site on 29 June 2016. With Denis de Rougemont and Theophil Spoerri, he took an active part in the setting up of the Gotthard League, a civil society movement dedicated to countering \\"defeatism and deceptive propaganda\\" in the face of intense Nazi propaganda which Switzerland was subject to at the time. \\"We wanted to proclaim that our country would remain faithful to his multi-secular democratic tradition\\", he explained.Andrew Stallybrass, Obituary of Philippe Mottu on Initiatives of Change site He then joined the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs in Bern. = The war years = In 1940, Philippe Mottu established contact with a German diplomat in Bern, Herbert Blankenhorn, and, through him, with Adam von Trott zu Solz, one of the leaders of German resistance to Nazism. Upon von Trott's invitation, Mottu travelled to Berlin in November 1942 where he meets with other members of the resistance. During a British bombardment, a top German Foreign Affairs official, Hans-Bernd von Haften, asked him: \\"As Christians, are we allowed to kill Hitler?\\" Supported by the Swiss foreign minister, Marcel Pilet-Golaz, Philippe Mottu continued his contacts with von Trott and offered to act as a liaison person between the allied powers and the German Resistance by travelling himself to the United States, even though it was difficult to travel outside Switzerland. In April 1944, von Trott visited Switzerland where he was promised assistance to reach Lisbon, while Allen Dulles, chief of the OSS in Switzerland, promised his assistance for a transatlantic trip. A few days after the joint US-British Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, Mottu was in Stuttgart with von Trott and his group of friends : their coup was imminent. Mottu left for Washington having memorised all the names of the new German government. To his despair, President Roosevelt and his advisors didn't believe in the German resistance. Additionally on 20 July 1944, Operation Walkyrie failed. His worst fears became reality when, in the course of the following weeks and months, he got confirmation of the arrest and execution of all the main conspirators : von Trott, von Haften and hundreds of others... = Caux = Philippe Mottu had been deeply affected by his experience during WWII. In 1943 already, a recurring thought had come to him: \\"If Switzerland escapes the ravages of this war, its mission will be to create a venue where French and Germans will be able to reconcile and build peace. Caux is the place.\\" With the financial support of around 100 Swiss families, Philippe Mottu and one of his friends Robert Hahnloser bought the derelict Caux Palace Hotel in 1946. It was repaired and refurbished thanks to the efforts of the Swiss and international teams, and, between 1946 and 1950, it welcomed thousands of French and German participants, among whom Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman, who will later rely on their exceptional mutual trust to launch the first steps of the European construction. The Caux summer conferences dedicated to peace and reconciliation are still taking place today. Philippe Mottu contributed to the governance of the Caux conference centre from 1946 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1973 as a member of the Caux Foundation council. He was the Foundation's first president, from 1946 to 1958. Later on, he increasingly turned to the writing of numerous political philosophy books.  Family  On , Philippe Mottu married H√©l√®ne de Trey. They will have four children, and, on the date of Philippe Mottu's death, nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

Legacy  As a thinker and as an activist, Philippe Mottu played a role in Swiss and European history, contributing to reinforce the spirit of resistance to fascism in Switzerland through the Gotthard League, to support German resistance to Hitler and on the European scene in triggering the setting up of the Caux conference Centre. Pioneer of Moral Rearmament in Switzerland, he left to the next generations the Caux conference centre, of which he was the inspirator and one of the most instrumental administrators. He was also a daring entrepreneur who signed the purchase contract for Caux in 1946, together with Robert Hahnloser, risking his name without knowing whether the necessary funds would be found in order to meet the down payments deadline.

Published in 1996, it is the first volume of a three-part series based on the aftermath of the Chaos War. Plot summary In the final moments of the Chaos War, Palin Majere descends into the Abyss to fight Chaos and defeats him with help of his future wife, Usha Majere, and other allies. Due to Chaos‚Äô defeat, all the powerful magic on Krynn has disappeared as the Gods took it with them. Back on Krynn, the blue dragon Khellendros, better known as Skie to humans, is searching for a different plane of existence to find Kitiara Uth Matar using magic portals located on Krynn. Khellendros plans on finding a worthy body for Kitiara to take and come back to life on Krynn. Khellendros finds a draconian and creates spawn from the draconian using a tear from his eye. Back in Solace, Palin has a dream of a dragon destroying the Tower of Sorcery in Palanthas. The Master of the Tower in Palanthas then destroys the Tower to prevent any dragon from getting any magical artifacts. A new large female red dragon, Malystryx, known as Malys, shows up to Ansalon and gains power over all other dragons. As she is gaining power, dragon overlords are established after word spreads. This process takes years, and in the meantime she eats smaller and weaker dragons to gain more power and strength. Malys and Khellendros agree to an alliance and eventually Khellendros realizes that humans are better for spawn then draconians are. The Conclave of Wizards convenes and establish that they must find another way to make magic and defend themselves from the dragon overlords. At the Tomb of Heroes in Solace, a young man, Dhamon Grimwulf is visiting and paying his respects to the fallen heroes of the Chaos War. While he is at prayer, he suddenly receives a vision from Goldmoon, one of the last surviving Heroes of the Lance. The vision calls for Dhamon to aid her in a quest she has prepared for him and to meet her at the Citadel of Light. All the meanwhile, a young male kender named Raf Tanglemop, and an elderly kender woman named Vera-Jay ‚ÄúBlister‚Äù Nimblefingers, decide to tag along with Dhamon on his way to see Goldmoon. The three companions arrive at Newports where they meet a dark-skinned mariner, Rig Mer-Krel, and his female friend, Shaon. They are joined by a dwarf, Jasper Fireforge, nephew of a Hero of the Lance Flint Fireforge, who once made a promise to his uncle Flint in a dream to aid Goldmoon in her quest. Goldmoon instructs her new heroes that they must travel to Palanthas where they are to meet Palin Majere and stop the evil there. Goldmoon gives Dhamon a cloth that was once tied to the famed Dragonlance. Jasper offers the mariners, Rig and Shaon, his ship appropriately titled, ‚ÄúFlint‚Äôs Anvil‚Äù as payment for their trip to Palanthas. One of the members of the crew is of this is a half-ogre named Groller whose sidekick is a red wolf named Fury. However, on the way to Palanthas, the kender, Raf, is killed in a freak accident on the ship and is buried at sea. He becomes the first of the new heroes to die. The companions first arrive at Caergoth on the way to Palanthas and confront some Knights of Takhisis. Dhamon and Rig get in a fight with the dark knights over their treatment of a beautiful Kagonesti elf named, Feril Dawnsprinter. She is in Caergoth trying to recruit knights to help fight the white dragon Gellidus, who has taken over her land in Southern Ergoth and changed the climate in the process. During the confrontation, one of the dark knights recognizes that Dhamon, who looks very familiar to him. A hurdlefolk named Fissure shows up one day to Khellendros and brings two wyverns with him. Khellendros informs Fissure that he wants humans for his spawn. Fissure responds to Khellendros to get artifacts from the Age of Dreams, as they have the most magic still left in them that Khellendros can use. This magic is to be used to re-open the portals and bring Kitiara back. He tells Fissure to search for these artifacts to get ogres and dark knights on his side so they can capture humans on the outskirts of Palanthas. In Palanthas, the companions arrive on the Flint's Anvil to meet Palin Majere. After hearing of people disappearing outside the city, the companions decide to investigate a village on the way to see Palin and are attacked by blue draconian spawn. The companions defeat the spawn and capture one of them with help of magic by Feril. The spawn reveals that they were ordered by their master to attack humans. All the meanwhile, Khellendros spies on the companions through the eyes of the captured spawn. He also wants to know whatever happened to Palin's parents, two Heroes of the Lance, Caramon and Tika Majere. Meanwhile, ogres raid the Flint's Anvil docked at Palanthas and take hostage the companions who stayed behind on the ship: Rig, Jasper, and Groller. The companions eventually meet Palin and the Master of the Tower of Palanthas who is working closely with Dhamon to stop the dragons. Feril and Dhamon see the original Dragonlance handle which is meant for them to take with them. The other half of the Dragonlance is missing and Palin is supposed to lead them to it. Palin and the Master of the Tower figure out where the dragon is hiding out and that the blue dragon is really Skie, from the War of the Lance. The companions come back to Flint's Anvil only to find out from Blister and Shaon that the others have been taken hostage. Palin uses a spell to summon Fury to find them, while Blister and Shaon decide to stay behind on the ship. Fury leads Palin, Dhamon, and Feril beyond the city to the foothills, where they spot an ogre prison camp and their friends among the prisoners. After a magic distraction by Palin, Feril sneaks into the camp and directs the prisoners away from the camp and a battle ensues. The heroes defeat the ogres, and the ogres tell them that Khellendros wanted humans for spawn. Meanwhile, Fissure shows up in Khellendros‚Äô cave and tells Khellendros that the humans have been rescued. This upsets Khellendros as he figures out that its Palin behind this and wants him and his friends destroyed. Fissure then disappears only to have Malys suddenly appear in his place. Malys is furious that Khellendors has been creating spawn behind her back and wants an explanation. Khellendros lies to her and says that he was creating spawn for her as a gift. Malys likes the idea of having armies of spawn and wants to create more of them with Khellendros. After Malys leaves, Fissure's wyverns return with a blue dragon named Gale, a former lieutenant of Khellendros. He orders Gale to find Palin and kill him and his friends. After rescuing the prisoners, Palin, Dhamon, and Feril need to meet up with Palin's parents, Caramon and Tika Majere, who are waiting for them at an inn in Palanthas, where they could pick up the second half of the lance which is in Caramon's possession. Caramon gives Dhamon the haft of the silver lance and the Dragonlance is now complete. A storm suddenly hits Palanthas, but it's not a natural storm, its Gale arriving in the city to find Palin and his companions. The three of them rush back to the Flint's Anvil where Gale attacks the ship and recognizes Dhamon. It's revealed that they used to be partners in the Chaos War and Dhamon was once a Knight of Takhisis. Gale wants Dhamon to come back with him, but Dhamon refuses to go with Gale, so Gale kills Shaon as punishment before he disappears. Dhamon leaves the ship to confront Gale in the outskirts of the city, where Gale tells Dhamon that he has a new master now and it's Khellendros. Dhamon decides to fight Gale and while jumping on Gale's back and fighting him above a lake, Dhamon fatally wounds Gale and they both fall and plunge into the lake. The novel ends with Dhamon being presumed dead and the remaining heroes deciding that they will continue to fight against the dragons in honor of Shaon and Dhamon.

Club gave the album a favorable review, stating, \\"At no point on its self-titled full-length debut does the Massachusetts trio stray from hummable melodies and easily discernible song structures. For all its \\"freaky\\" trappings, Quilt is first and foremost a pop-rock band, and judging by Quilt, it has the makings of being quite a good one.\\" Chrysta Cherrie of AllMusic praised the album's cohesiveness, stating, \\"Quilt live up to their name, weaving a tapestry that‚Äôs warm in its dreamy, early-morning feel and comforting in its mantra-like delivery. Also as the name suggests -- and thanks to the band‚Äôs free approach to songwriting, letting the music flow where it may and carving out lyrics later -- the songs meld together to work like movements of one fuller piece as well as stand-alone compositions.\\" Emilie Friedlander of Pitchfork praised the band's musical style, stating, \\"Like their namesake, Quilt's music feels handmade and stitched-together, as though its creators were sifting through a collection of musical hand-me-downs and collating the bits that spoke to them into something new. This patchwork quality extends not only to their juxtaposition, say, of Neil Young bass-bounce and the kind of half-spoken poetic narration you might hear on one of The Incredible String Band's early records, but to their melodic sensibility at large, which favors tightly interlocking arrangements of simple motifs.\\" Track listing References 2011 debut albums Quilt (band) albums Mexican Summer albums ","title":"Quilt (album)"},{"id":"51253237","title":"Neiked"},{"id":"51253239","text":"Lake Goodrich is a lake located in Waterford Township, Michigan, USA.

It's carefully and competently constructed, palatable but perilously short on whimsy. The cover image, a drawing by the late Los Angeles contemporary artist Ken Price, is awfully easy on the eyes. But Quilt's newly straight-laced psych simply doesn't hold the interest of its current peers, whether it's Amen Dunes' drunken confessionals or Widowspeak's dreamy intimacy. Folk-pop has moved on, while Quilt has evened out. They're still searching, but the mystery's already been solved.\\" Graeme Marsh of musicOMH gave the album an average review, stating, \\"Whilst Held in Splendor was seen as major progress, Plaza as a whole feels more like a band treading water in the middle of a psychedelic ocean wondering which way the land lies. It would be lazy to arrive at the conclusion that it's simply down to a gaping divide between those tracks led by Rochinski's sultry tones and those where the lead vocals come from her male companions, but it is strikingly obvious that those songs are where an appreciation for Plaza should probably begin.\\" Track listing References 2016 albums Quilt (band) albums Mexican Summer albums ","title":"Plaza (album)"},{"id":"51253244","text":"Denys Rylskyi (; born May 12, 1989) is a Ukrainian footballer currently the player/coach for Ukraine AC in the Arena Premier League.

Blaakyum started performing without a bassist and covered pop/rock songs and spiritual songs in front of churches. Meanwhile, Maroun Azar left the band to concentrate on studying Medicine, and Jead Abdallah was asked to join the band as a Bassist since he is originally a guitarist but he couldn't fill that part so he decided to help the band in management.

Mano was brought to fill in the bass role and the band started looking for a lead guitarist. after trying a couple of guitarists they found Shant Bajac, but Bajac had also official exams so he also left. Nohra rejoined the band, but things didn't work out, and he insisted that Bassem Deaibess would quit singing and concentrate on the rhythm Guitar, in the same time he started another band with Mano and Saad called \\"Society\\". Deaibess then met Vic Bajac (Shant's elder brother) in a rehearsal center where \\"Society\\" were rehearsing, and they decide to reform Blaakyum. =1998‚Äì2001= By 1998, the band changed their style into a blend of Thrash, Heavy and Groove Metal infused with Middle Eastern and Levantine folk music vibes, a nod to the band's origins and influences, coming from a country that straddles eastern and western civilizations on the south-eastern coast of the Mediterranean and with members inspired by Metallica, Testament, Overkill, Annihilator, Onslaught, Slayer and Iron Maiden, just to name a few, along with oriental music icons such as Fairouz, Sabah and Marcel Khalife. Winning the Lebanese Bands Competition in 1997, Blaakyum released its first single, \\"Am I Black\\", in 1998, at the height of the anti-Metal witch hunt conducted by the Lebanese religious and political authorities, who considered anyone affiliated with the scene a national threat, and during which the band‚Äôs founder and frontman, Bassem Deaibess, was detained and jailed simply for being a Heavy Metal musician and fan. Due to Lebanon's dire economic conditions and a mixture of personal and health problems that hit the band's members, Blaakyum was forced to split in 2001. Deaibess continued to perform with other bands. In 2006, war hit Lebanon again, destroying much of its infrastructure (electricity, water, roads), which remains in disarray. =2007‚Äìpresent= But by the end of 2007, Blaakyum was back with fresh new members that Deaibess picked from the new generation: Gio Najarian (Drums), Rany Battikh (Bass). Later this year they won the Lebanese Nationals in the Global Battle of the Bands (GBOB), representing Lebanon in London. Among 3,000 bands that participated in the GBOB and 35 finalists, Blaakyum earned the seventh place. The following year, Blaakyum entered the studio to record its debut album, a process that took more than four years to be completed. The band released \\"Lord Of The Night\\" on Friday, 13 January 2012 which was well received by critics. In 2012 another wave of anti-Metal Music took place and Bassem Deaibess was detained for the second time. Blaakyum set on the \\"Night Lords\\" tour that took it all over Lebanon as well as Egypt at Metal Blast Festival. The tour also had shows at Metal Heads' Mission 2012 in Ukraine, MetalCamp 2012 in Slovenia, and playing gigs in Slovakia (Bratislava‚ÄîRandal Club) and Poland (Warsaw‚ÄîProgresjia Club). Blaakyum subsequently performed on the main stage at Metaldays 2013 (formerly MetalCamp) and began working on its second album. In 2015, Blaakyum became the Middle East winner of Wacken Open Air's Metal Battle. And achieved third place in the 2015 worldwide finals of the Metal Battle at Wacken Open Air Germany,http://metal-bell.com/blaakyum-wins- third-place-at-the-biggest-metal-band-competition-on-earth On April 4, 2017, Blaakyum announcedhttp://teamrock.com/feature/2017-04-04/enter-the-war-torn- world-of-lebanese-groove-thrash-standard-bearers-blaakyum the official video for the track 'Freedom Denied' on Metal Hammer.

Behai established a publication called _Behai Quarterly_ that ran from 1934 to 1937 and further tried to consolidate any Baha'is who defected from the leadership of Shoghi Effendi, such as Khayru'll√°h. These went by a variety of names: Unitarian Baha'is, Society of Bahaists, New History Society, or National Association of Universal Religion. The attempted schism was unsuccessful and Behai returned to Palestine. The sect gradually faded into obscurity and disappeared.

Career  G√°doros began his career as an apprentice in his father's woodworking shop, and in 1926 he was accepted to the furniture design program at the Hungarian Royal School of Applied Arts, where he studied under the tutelage of Gyula Kaesz and K√°roly Weichinger. Heeding Prof. Weichinger's advice, he applied to and attended the Technical College of Stuttgart in Germany (Technischen Hochschule Stuttgart; today: Universit√§t Stuttgart) between 1929 and 1930, where he studied with Paul Bonatz. G√°doros later went on to study with Clemens Holzmeister at the Arts Academy in D√ºsseldorf (Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf), and in 1933 he returned home to Hungary. Following his return, he soon began working and designing furniture for Antal Nagy, and later obtained a position at the design studio of Lajos Kozma. In 1935, G√°doros was employed by Gyula Kaesz's design firm, but soon began to take on independent projects as well, such as designing family homes, storefronts and interiors. In addition, G√°doros submitted a variety of grant proposals during this period while working in partnership with P√°l Vince (also known as P√°l Weiss), his former classmate from Stuttgart and D√ºsseldorf. Beginning in 1939, he was repeatedly conscripted into the army: as a sapper, G√°doros was sent to the Russian battlefront, and served as a liaison officer between the German and Hungarian troops. He was later captured by German forces as a result of his attempt to desert the army of the Axis powers. After the German troops were overpowered by the Allies, G√°doros was transported near to the city of Munich, and was held prisoner of war by the Americans. Following his brief confinement, G√°doros was released and returned to Budapest Between 1945 and 1947, G√°doros worked for the National Housing Committee and for the Municipal Council of Construction and Public Work. During this same period, he managed a privately held company with his partner G√°bor Preisich. After submitting their plans for a grant, they were commissioned to design M√âMOSZ Hall (National Association of Hungarian Contractors). Together they also participated in the design of the Ministry of Interior (today: The Office of the National Assembly) as well as the interior design of Nagysz√°llo on Margaret Island, known today as the Danubius Grand Hotel Budapest. In 1945, he was elected member of the Division of Applied Arts of the Hungarian Council of Arts, and in 1946, he became secretary of the Circle of New Architecture. In December 1947, G√°doros and Imre Per√©nyi co- founded the privately held Center for Architecture. In 1948, he was employed by the de-privatized √âTI (Institute of Architecture), and in December 1948, he became manager of the Division of Housing at MATI (Highrise Design Firm). As MATI was re-structured in the fall of 1949 to become K√ñZTI (Public Buildings Design Firm and National Enterprise), G√°doros was promoted to director. Due to his ability to acquire some of the most renowned architects for K√ñZTI, such as Istv√°n Janaky Sr, Gyula Riman√≥czy, Iv√°n Kotsis and Istv√°n Medgyaszay, the firm became one of the most influential organizations in the field of architecture during the immediate post-war era. As a result of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, G√°doros announced his intentions to resign his post as director of K√ñZTI, and despite the protest of his colleagues, he eventually stepped down. Between 1957 and 1960, G√°doros was designer and principal architect at √Å√âTV (General Architectural and Engineering Company). It was during this time that G√°doros won the Star of Gold award at the Expo 58 (also known as the Brussels World's Fair) with his Hungarian Pavilion design, as well as finished his designs for the University of P√©cs Medical School. Alongside P√°l S√°voly, he played a crucial role in the restoration of Elisabeth Bridge (1961-1964), and in 1960 he was appointed Head of Department of Freehand Drawing in the Faculty of Architecture at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. In 1966, G√°doros took over the position of Head of Department of Public Building Design from his former professor K√°roly Weichinger. G√°doros resigned from his university post as Head of Department ten years later, in 1976, and in 1980, at the age of seventy, G√°doros officially retired. Laying out the plans for the building complex of the Vadaskert Child Psychiatry Hospital and Outpatient Clinic in 1989 was his last professional work. In 1994, G√°doros's family donated his inheritance to the Hungarian Museum of Architecture. G√°doros was awarded the prestigious architectural Ybl Prize two times during his lifetime, first in 1953 for the design of Szinkron Studio (Pannonia Film Studio), and later in 1958 together with Istv√°n N√©meth for the design of the Hungarian Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair. For this latter design, G√°doros was also bestowed the Order of the Crown by Baudouin, King of the Belgians. In 1962, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA) awarded him the Candidate of Science degree. He was member of MTA's Architectural Committee, and received his last distinction on June 18, 1984. The award was endorsed by president of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics Dr. K√°roly Polinszky, and read: \\"this honorary medal is hereby awarded to retired university professor Dr. Lajos Gadoros for his distinguished accomplishments in the field of education.\\"  Awards  * 1953 ‚Äì Ybl Prize ‚Äì Szinkron Studio (Pannonia Film Studio) * 1958 ‚Äì Ybl Prize ‚Äì Hungarian Pavilion at Brussels World's Fair (Expo 58) * 1958 ‚Äì Order of the Crown - Hungarian Pavilion at Brussels World's Fair (Expo 58) * 1962 ‚Äì Candidate of Science by Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA) * 1984 ‚Äì Honorary Medal by Budapest University of Technology and Economics  Selected works  * 1935-36 ‚Äì Mansion of the Emmer family ‚Äì Sasfi√≥k utca 4, District XII, Budapest, Hungary * 1936 ‚Äì Storefront of Veres Foto Optika, V√∂r√∂smarty ter 6, District V, Budapest, Hungary * 1936-37 ‚Äì Summerhouse of Gizella Flam, D√©va utca 3, Si√≥fok, Hungary * Interior design and storefront of the Koestlin pastry shops * 1946 ‚Äì The re-modeling of F√©lix Perutz's wainwright shop, Kertesk≈ë, Hungary * 1947 ‚Äì Storefront of Metalloglobusz (in partnership with G√°bor Preisich), Bajcsy-Zsilinszky √∫t 24. ‚Äì Arany J√°nos utca 35, Budapest, Hungary * 1948-49 ‚Äì Apartment building on B√©ke t√©r, Csepel, Budapest, Hungary (in partnership with J√≥zsef Schall) ‚Äì based on the same design, also built in √öjpest, Salg√≥tarj√°n, Di√≥sgy≈ër and P√©cs * 1947-50 ‚Äì M√âMOSZ Hall (in partnership with Imre Per√©nyi, G√°bor Preisich, Gy√∂rgy Szrogh), D√≥zsa Gy√∂rgy √∫t 84/A, District VI, Budapest, Hungary * 1947-51 ‚Äì Interior Ministry (today: The Office of the National Assembly), (in partnership with √Ågost Benkhard, L√°szl√≥ G√°bor, G√°bor Preisich, Gyula Rudnai ), J√°szai Mari t√©r, Budapest, Hungary * 1952-54 ‚Äì Szinkron Studio (Pannonia Film Studio), (in partnership with Istv√°n M√ºhlbacher), V√∂r√∂s Hadsereg √∫tja (today: H≈±v√∂sv√∂lgyi √∫t) 64-66, District II, Budapest, Hungary * 1953 ‚Äì Design of the theater in Gy≈ër, interior design: Istv√°n N√©meth (was never built) * 1958 ‚Äì Hungarian Pavilion at Brussels World's Fair (Expo 58), interior design: Istv√°n N√©meth * 1961 ‚Äì Olimpia Restaurant, Ur√°nv√°ros, P√©cs, Hungary, interior design: Gy√∂rgy Fekete * 1957-66 ‚Äì University of P√©cs Medical School * 1989 ‚Äì Design of the Vadaskert Child Psychiatry Hospital and Outpatient Clinic, architect: P√©ter Krikovszky  Bibliography  * G√°doros, Lajos (1946).

Built between 1935 and 1936, the building exemplifies Depression-era Moderne architecture, while Art Moderne and Art Deco finishes characterize the interior. It housed the Austin division of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas and other judicial offices until 2012, when a new federal courthouse building was completed. Since 2016 the building has been owned by Travis County, which is renovating the facility to be used as county court space. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History Austin's previous U.S. courthouse was built between 1877 and 1881, but by the 1920s the federal district court had come to need additional space. After considering expanding the existing structure, authorities instead selected a new site for a larger building. In June 1934, Congress passed a measure appropriating $415,000 for the construction of the new U.S. courthouse in Austin, with some funding coming from the Public Works Administration. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 16, 1935, and the building was dedicated and opened to the public by mayor Tom Miller on September 22, 1936. In addition to its main tenant (the Austin division of the District Court for the Western District of Texas), the Austin U.S. courthouse of 1936 has held the offices of the Collector of Internal Revenue, the Referee in Bankruptcy (later the U.S. Bankruptcy Court), the U.S. Weather Bureau, the U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services Office, and other judicial functions related to the U.S. Department of Justice such as the U.S. Marshal's Office. It has also housed U.S. representatives and senators, including Lyndon B. Johnson. By the 2000s the tenants of the courthouse were once again running out of space, and funds from the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were used to construct another even larger federal courthouse building for Austin. The new courthouse was completed and opened to the public in December 2012, at which point all federal courts and offices in the old building were closed. At the time it was not clear what the fate of the building would be. =Post- closure= In 2013 the Austin Bar Foundation asked the GSA to lease the old courthouse to hold several local legal programs, but the GSA declined, saying that it intended to \\"use the courthouse for judiciary-related services that were not able to fit into the new courthouse,\\" most likely the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the local members of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had been operating in a separate office building. However, no new federal courts ever occupied the facility. Instead, in November 2015 the GSA announced that it had begun to consider the old courthouse for disposal proceedings as an excess asset. The facility and the land it occupies were designated as surplus property in May 2016, after which Travis County began talks with the GSA about using the building for additional county court space, in part because of the recent failure of a bond measure to raise funds to replace the aging Travis County Courthouse. The City of Austin had considered pursuing the site as well, but it ultimately decided to support the county's bid for the courthouse; other nongovernmental organizations also applied to the GSA for the use of the building, including some hoping to use the facility for services to assist the homeless. At a press conference on December 29, 2016, officials from Travis County and the federal judiciary and local U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett announced that ownership of the courthouse had been transferred to Travis County. The county budgeted $28 million to bring the structure up to current building codes and adapt it for use as the new county probate court by 2020. Architecture The Austin U.S. Courthouse is a four-story steel-and-concrete building clad with cream-colored limestone. Its design exemplifies the PWA Moderne architectural style of many Great Depression-era public buildings, with its symmetrical rectangular form, recessed vertical window bays, and smooth stonework exterior decorated with neoclassical flourishes, stylized eagles and geometric detailing. The building was designed by local architect Charles Henry Page (well known for his work on other Texas courthouses of the period) together with New York architect Kenneth Franzheim. The design work was overseen by Louis A. Simon, the Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury Department. The construction contractor was Algernon Blair of Montgomery, Alabama. The W. E. Simpson Company of San Antonio served as the structural engineer, and R. F. Taylor of Houston was the mechanical engineer. =Exterior= The main entry is in the south facade, where gray granite steps lead to four bronze doors beneath a central massing that projects from the front and top of the building. A large carved eagle with a shield near the peak recreates the Great Seal of the United States, below which is inscribed \\"UNITED STATES COURT HOUSE\\" flanked by raised five-pointed stars. A fluted horizontal band separates the windows of the first and second floors, while the higher windows are joined in recessed vertical window bays with decorative cast-iron spandrels between. Pilasters run vertically between window bays from the second floor to the fourth. An incised horizontal band wraps the building near the roofline, and the structure's square corners gradually chamfer as they approach the roof. =Interior= The building's interior exhibits Art Moderne and Art Deco finishes and detailing. The lobbies and corridors have marble and plaster walls, geometrically patterned terrazzo floors, and plaster ceilings with white bronze molding. The ceremonial courtroom is a double-height chamber with wall paneling of light bookmatched wood set in darker wood squares and a coffered plaster ceiling. Light fixtures range from white-bronze-and-glass chandeliers to wall sconces with Art Deco detailing.

Its headquarters are in Falls Church, Virginia. As of 2017, Analytic Services Inc. has 227 employees. History =1950s-2000= Incorporated in California in 1958 as a not-for-profit corporation, ANSER was originally established to support the United States Air Force. It began operations with 25 technical and ten support staff members in September of that year. Shortly after it was established, it became a Federal Contract Research Center (FCRC), one of nine such organizations including RAND, Aerospace Corporation, MITRE, CNA, and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Dr. Stanley Lawwill was selected by the Board of Directors to be the company's first president; he served from 1958 to 1981. After starting out in temporary quarters in Alexandria, Virginia, ANSER moved to permanent offices in Falls Church, Virginia in 1960. Throughout the 1960s, ANSER's staff performed research and analysis to help the Air Force make decisions about strategic missiles, attack aircraft and fighters, navigation systems, and ‚Äúover-the- horizon‚Äù radar. Releasing its FCRC designation in 1976, ANSER began to work for other United States Department of Defense components, and select federal agencies. With a staff that had grown to 156 members, in 1978 the company moved to new quarters at 400 Army-Navy Drive, within view of the Pentagon. Upon Dr. Lawwill's retirement, Jack Englund (1981‚Äì1991) was elected president of the company. ANSER continued to research projects for the Air Force, while also diversifying into health systems and the protection of radioactive materials. To support its growing work with the Air Force Space Command, in 1983 the company expanded its footprint by opening an office in Colorado Springs. By the time Dr. John Fabian (1991‚Äì1998) was named ANSER's third president, the company had grown to over 400 staff members. Dr. Fabian was a former military pilot and astronaut who had served as a mission specialist on the space shuttles Discovery and Challenger. On the Challenger mission in 1984 a crewmember was Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space. The company had already developed contacts with the Russian space program in the 1980s, and in 1992 established a satellite office in Moscow known as the Center for International Aerospace Coordination, making it the first U.S. defense firm to open such an office in Russia. =2000s-present= In March 2001, ANSER moved to new offices in Shirlington. Shortly before, Dr. Ruth David (1998‚Äì2015) had been selected as its fourth president. ANSER moved into \\"homeland security\\" projects that year. In the spring of 2001, the company invested its personnel and assets to create the ANSER Institute for Homeland Security, making it well-positioned for contracts after the events of 9/11 that year. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 called for the establishment of a federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), to be called the Homeland Security Institute (HSI). In 2004, ANSER won the contract to host HSI, a think tank devoted to addressing national policy and security issues where scientific, technical, and analytical expertise is required. In the decade that followed, the company experienced increased revenues and substantial growth in its workforce. In addition to analyzing a wide range of homeland security threats, ANSER also developed a forensics capability for the United States Armed Forces, developing antiterrorism communications for the Army, and helping plan and develop the U.S. Vietnam War Commemoration. In 2013, the company relocated to Skyline, just a short distance from a building it had occupied 35 years before. Upon Dr. David's retirement in 2015, Carmen Spencer was selected as fifth president and CEO. His background in chemical/biological defense expanded the corporation's position in this arena. Mr. Spencer led a push to achieve a longtime ANSER objective, the acquisition of a company that would diversify its reach. In January 2017, ANSER purchased Advanced Technology International (ATI) of Summerville, South Carolina, a non- profit entity that organizes and manages research and development consortia on behalf of the Federal Government. That same year, ANSER was named to Bloomberg's top 100 ranking of Federal contractors based on prime contracts awarded in the past fiscal year.

She is a posthumous Hero of the Soviet Union. Early life Gromova was born to working-class family on 3 January 1925 in the village of Pervomaysky (, named for International Labor Day) in what is now Luhansk Province of the Ukraine (then in the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union; Luhansk Province was not established until 1938). Gromova's father, Matthew Maximovich Gromov, was born in 1880 in Poltava Province of Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. Gromova's father served in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, then moved to Krasnodon and worked as mineworker, retiring in 1937. Gromova's mother (born 1884) was housewife; the family had five children, Ulyana being the youngest. In March 1940 Ulyana Gromova joined the Komsomol (Young Communist League). At the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Gromova was 17 years old and in tenth grade. Like many of her classmates, she worked in agriculture to replace farm workers and took care of wounded soldiers in the hospital (reading to them, helping them write letters, and so forth). She was graduated from high school with good to excellent marks on 3 June 1942. Resistance, arrest, and execution When her home province was occupied by German troops, which began on 17 July 1942, Gromova was not able to evacuate because she needed to care for her sick mother. Together with Maya Peglivanovoy and Anatoly Popov, she organized a group of patriotic young people in her village of Pervomaysky who became part of the \\"Young Guard\\" of the underground resistance Komsolol organization in September 1942. In October 1942, Gromova was elected a member of staff of the organization. She took an active part in the preparations for armed resistance, the creation and dissemination of anti- fascist leaflets, collecting medicines, and campaigning among the population, urging them to not obey the enemy and to disrupt plans to supply the Germans with material and impress Soviet youth to work in Germany. On the night of November 7, 1942 (on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the October Revolution), Gromova and Popov hoisted the red flag on a pipe shaft at Mine Number 1 in occupied Krasnodon. Mass arrest of suspected underground figures began in the city, and the Young Guards developed an escape plan for Gromova, but she was arrested by the German authorities on 10 January 1943. She was severely beaten and tortured during interrogation, but she stayed true to her oath to her motherland and comrades and did not reveal details of the underground's activities. She was hung by her hair, burned with hot irons, had a five-pointed star cut into her back and the wound rubbed with salt, and suffered a broken arm and broken ribs. She endured her suffering stoically, and even cheered her imprisoned comrades by reciting Lermontov's epic poem Demon, which she knew by heart. Even in the note which she managed to pass secretly to her relatives, knowing her death was near, she expressed faith in victory and called for her brother Elisha to stand firmly for his homeland. On 16 January 1943 Gromova, along with other Young Guards, was executed, and her body thrown in the 58-meter pit of Mine Number 5 in Krasnodon. After the liberation of Krasnodon (which occurred on 14 February 1943), Gromova was buried with military honors on 1 March 1943 in a mass grave of patriotic heroes in the central square of Krasnodon, where a memorial to the Young Guards was erected.

In the 1948 film The Young Guard based on Fadeyev's novel, Gromova is played by Nonna Mordyukova in her film debut. In many cities of the former Soviet Union, there are streets named for Gromova and memorials to her. For instance, in Nizhny Tagil is Ulyana Gromova Street, likewise in Kaliningrad a busy street is named for her, and Tolyatti has a memorial to her.

Announced on August 3, 2016, the park will be set on a constructed deck that encloses the active Railway Lands between Bathurst Street and Blue Jays Way, west of the Rogers Centre. In total, the park will span when constructed. As of November 2017, the City of Toronto estimated the park to cost $1.66 billion. In May 2020, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation released a study saying that once exclusions from the city's estimates are factored in the park would cost more than $3.7 billion.https://www.taxpayer.com/media/CTF_Rail_Deck_Park_Costs_Study.pdf The plan was met with acclaim in local and national media, and was likened to other similar city rail yard redevelopment projects in North America, such as Millennium Park in Chicago and Hudson Yards in New York City. Development =Background= The plan was first announced to the media in the CityPlace neighbourhood, south of the Railway Lands near Bathurst Street. The announcement was made by Toronto Mayor John Tory and Joe Cressy, city councillor representing the Trinity‚ÄîSpadina ward who described the project as a legacy for the city. Development of the park would require the City of Toronto government to purchase air rights of the Railway Lands, which is currently owned by Canadian National Railway, Toronto Terminals Railway and Metrolinx. Costs or timeline of construction of the park were not divulged, but was preliminarily described by Tory to cost \\"tens of millions of dollars per acre\\". Toronto chief planner Jennifer Keesmaat will present a detailed report to City Council on the Rail Deck Park proposal in Fall 2017. In December 2017, the Toronto City Council voted in favour of pushing ahead planned work for Rail Deck Park in a 36-4 vote. =Potential extension= Following the initial announcement of the proposed park, the Toronto Star suggested that Rail Deck Park could help revive plans for Oxford Place by Oxford Properties in 2013 to redevelop the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, located east of the proposed park, into public space. A potential eastward extension of Rail Deck Park to include Oxford Place could place the park among the largest rail deck parks in the world, with a total combined park area of nearly 10.5 hectares (25.5 acres). = Competing Proposal - ORCA (Over Rail Corridor Area) Project = In May 2017 a new submission was made to the City of Toronto. The Plan Amendment calls for the north end of the rail corridor to be redeveloped with eight high-rise towers, while just over half of the lot‚Äîsome 12.8 acres‚Äîwould be devoted to a new public park on the south half of the site. It was proposed by a consortium identified as P.I.T.S. Developments Inc. In July 2019, ORCA lost its appeal of the City of Toronto's rezoning of the air rights over the railway tracks for parklands. ORCA will be compensated by the City of Toronto through negotiations or the City will expropriate.

History The union was established in 1952, when the Bradford and District Association of Warp Dressers, the Halifax and District Association of Warpdressers and the Huddersfield and District Worsted and Woollen Warpers' Association merged with the Yorkshire Warp Twisters' Society. The industry was already in decline and, by 1960, its membership was only 1,239.Arthur Marsh, Victoria Ryan and John B.

In a re-match of the 100th Grey Cup, the Argos won the game 27‚Äì24, winning their 17th championship. Background =Host city= It was reported in September 2015 that Ottawa would host the Grey Cup game, and that it would be determined at a board of governor's meeting later that fall. It was stated by the Ottawa Redblacks ownership group, Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group, that one of the clauses in their expansion agreement was that the club would host a Grey Cup game within their first four years of existence. Since the Redblacks entered the league in 2014, 2017 would be the fourth such year. Ottawa had previously been awarded the 102nd Grey Cup but backed out due to construction delays; that game would be held in Vancouver instead. During an Ottawa Redblacks game on July 31, 2016, it was announced in a video featuring Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the city of Ottawa had been selected to host the 105th Grey Cup, in part to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Canada. This will be the seventh time that the Grey Cup game will be played in Ottawa, with each of those games being played at Lansdowne Park. The most recent game hosted by Ottawa was when the Ottawa Renegades hosted the 92nd Grey Cup in 2004, when the Toronto Argonauts defeated the BC Lions. Redblacks president Jeff Hunt stated that approximately 10,000 temporary seats would be added to TD Place Stadium, bringing seating capacity to about 35,000. In early May, more than six months before the game, the Redblacks announced that fewer than 6,000 of the original 35,000 tickets were yet to be sold. Due to ticket demand, the Redblacks added additional temporary bleachers in September to bring capacity to approximately 36,000 and the game officially sold out on October 26. =Teams= Calgary Stampeders The Stampeders finished the regular season with a record of , once again placing as the top team in the West Division. They became the first team in the league to clinch a playoff spot in Week 14 of the regular season with a 15-9 victory over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. The Stampeders entered the playoffs on a losing streak, losing three in a row for the first time since 2007. As the first place team in the West, the Stampeders received a bye in the first round of the playoffs and hosted the Western Final on November 19 against the third place Edmonton Eskimos. The Stampeders won the game 32-28 in a closely contested game that featured a controversial play by the Eskimos, who late in the fourth quarter opted to kick a field goal in the hopes that they could recover the ball, instead of tying the game with a touchdown. Calgary maintained possession until the end of the game to clinch victory. Toronto Argonauts The Argonauts placed first in the East Division with a record and returned to the playoffs after having missed the previous season. The Argos entered the season with a new head coach in Marc Trestman, the former head coach of the Montreal Alouettes and the NFL's Chicago Bears. The team's resurgence was led by quarterback Ricky Ray, who completed the 2017 regular season having thrown for 5,546 yards and 28 touchdowns. Despite the team's success on the field, the team averaged only 13,914 fans per home game at BMO Field, which was down from the previous year. As the first place team in the East, the Argos hosted the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Eastern Final after the Riders, as a crossover team, defeated the Ottawa Redblacks in the Semi- Final. The Argos won the close game 25-21 after scoring a touchdown with 23 seconds left in the game. It was the first time the Argos had won the Eastern Final since 2012, the last time they won the Grey Cup. Head-to-Head Calgary and Toronto met twice during the 2017 regular season, with Calgary winning both times. Their first meeting took place during Week 7 in Toronto and saw the Stampeders win 41‚Äì24. Three weeks later, the teams met again in Calgary, with the Stampeders winning 23‚Äì7. The 2017 Grey Cup was the fourth championship match-up between the two teams, with Calgary winning in 1971 and Toronto victorious in 1991 and 2012. The Argos' 2017 Grey Cup victory was their first defeat of the Calgary Stampeders since a 33-27 win in September 2013. During the week leading up to the game, the mayors of Toronto and Calgary, John Tory (who was the CFL commissioner from 1996-2000) and Naheed Nenshi, placed a friendly bet on the outcome, with the losing city's mayor having to donate to charity, wear the winning team's jersey at the next city council meeting, and send the other a selection of local craft beer. Game summary Toronto won the coin toss and opted to defer to the second half. Calgary chose to receive the ball. The game was played in inclement conditions, with snow falling prior to kickoff and persisting throughout. Neither team could sustain drives throughout much of the first quarter until eleven minutes in, when Stamps quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell connected with Kamar Jorden for the contest's first touchdown. Calgary missed the subsequent two-point convert attempt, but found themselves up 6‚Äì0. Scrimmaging from their own 10-yard line, the Argos opened the second quarter with a bang. DeVier Posey caught a pass from Toronto quarterback Ricky Ray at the Argo 44 and scampered to the end zone to tie the game 6‚Äì6. At 100 yards, this now stands as the longest touchdown pass in Grey Cup history, breaking the previous mark of 99 yards set by Montreal's Anthony Calvillo and Pat Woodcock in 2002. Calgary would respond five minutes later with a touchdown by running back Jerome Messam and a successful two-point convert to go up 14-6. While the Argos were shut out offensively in the second quarter, they scored two points thanks to a safety conceded by Calgary punter Rob Maver who, after mishandling a high snap, kicked the ball out of the back of the end zone. Rene Paredes booted a field goal with five seconds left in the quarter to put the Stampeders up 17‚Äì8 at the half. Toronto opened the scoring in the second half four minutes into the third quarter with a two-yard touchdown run by running back James Wilder Jr.. A successful two-point conversion made the score 17‚Äì16. Jerome Messam would find the end zone again for the Stampeders roughly five minutes later, putting Calgary up 24‚Äì16 after a successful convert by Parades. The Stamps would protect this lead into the fourth quarter and appeared well on their way to victory when, with the ball on the Argo 8-yard-line, Toronto DB Cassius Vaughn pounced on a Kamar Jorden fumble and returned the ball 109 yards for a touchdown‚Äîanother Grey Cup record. A two-point convert reception by Declan Cross tied the game at 24‚Äì24 with under five minutes to play. With 53 seconds left, Argo kicker Lirim Hajrullahu kicked the team's lone field goal, giving Toronto its first lead at 27‚Äì24. On their final possession Calgary drove the ball deep into Argonaut territory, but instead of attempting a game-tying field goal decided to go for the jugular. On 2nd-and-5 from the Argonaut 25, Mitchell's would-be touchdown pass fell into the hands of Argo defender Matt Black, sealing the victory for the Double Blue. = Scoring summary = ;First Quarter :CGY ‚Äì TD Jorden 33 yard pass (missed two-point convert) (4:00) 6‚Äì0 CGY ;Second Quarter :TOR ‚Äì TD Posey 100 yard pass (missed convert) (15:00) 6‚Äì6 Tie :CGY ‚Äì TD Messam 6 yard rush (Daniels two-point convert) (10:21) 14‚Äì6 CGY :TOR ‚Äì Safety Maver (5:46) 14‚Äì8 CGY :CGY ‚Äì FG Paredes 39 yards (0:05) 17-8 CGY ;Third Quarter :TOR ‚Äì TD Wilder Jr 2 yard rush (Cross two-point convert) (10:51) 17‚Äì16 CGY :CGY ‚Äì TD Messam 6 yard pass (Parades convert) (6:19) 24‚Äì16 CGY ;Fourth Quarter :TOR ‚Äì TD Vaughn 109 yard fumble return (Cross two-point convert) (5:16) 24‚Äì24 Tie :TOR ‚Äì FG Hajrullahu 32 yards (0:53) 27‚Äì24 TOR Entertainment On August 10, 2017, the CFL announced that Shania Twain would perform during the Freedom Mobile Halftime Show.

Vancouver-based rapper SonReal performed immediately prior to the game as part of the SiriusXM Kickoff Show. Toronto choir Choir! Choir! Choir! sang the national anthem. Aftermath Immediately following the game, Argonauts receiver DeVier Posey was named the game's Most Valuable Player, having put up 175 yards and one touchdown on seven receptions. Running back Jerome Messam of the Stampeders received the Dick Suderman Trophy as the game's Most Valuable Canadian after scoring two touchdowns. With the victory, Argonauts quarterback Ricky Ray became the first quarterback in CFL history to win the Grey Cup four times as a starting quarterback (twice with the Edmonton Eskimos and twice with the Argonauts). Television The game was watched by an average of 4.3 million viewers, with viewership peaking at nearly six million during the Argos' comeback in the fourth quarter. Nearly a third of the population of Canada watched part of the game. The game saw a ten percent increase in viewership over the previous year and a fifty-eight percent increase in viewership in the Toronto/Hamilton market. Overall, the 105th Grey Cup was the most watched Grey Cup since 2013.

The union was founded in 1865 and was initially named the Power Loom Brussels Carpet Weavers Defence Association. In its early days, it advocated for the emigration of unemployed carpet weavers, in order that they could find alternative work elsewhere, and competition in the industry would be reduced. This idea was soon abandoned, and in 1869 the union began admitting tapestry weavers in the area, changing its name to the Power Loom Carpet Weavers Mutual Defence and Provident Association.Arthur Marsh, Victoria Ryan and John B. Smethurst, Directory of British Trade Unions, vol.4, pp.498-499 In its early years, the union was very small, with only 588 members by the end of the 1860s. It focused on providing benefits for members who were unable to work, but did organise a strike in 1884. Its membership peaked at 1,384 in 1893, but then declined. In 1917, the union began admitting women and textile workers outside carpet and tapestry weaving, changing its name to the Power Loom Carpet Weavers' and Textile Workers' Association. This produced a jump in membership, which reached 4,500 by the end of 1918, and remained fairly constant thereafter, peaking at 6,000 in 1980. The 1980s proved a difficult time for the union as the industry declined in the Kidderminster area, and membership had fallen to 2,300 by 1991.

It discusses race relations in Dallas, Texas from the city's founding until the time of publication. It examines the relationship between White Protestants, White Catholics, Whites of Slavic descent, Blacks, Mexican Americans, and Jews. The book's thesis is that the city's powers that be used the desire for \\"whiteness\\" to control not only non-White minorities but also working class Whites,Fairbanks, p. 311. and that it gained power and directed the development of Dallas through exploiting the concept of whiteness and religion.Davis, Rod. \\"BOOKS: In Your Face.\\" D Magazine.

The goal of those white elites was to link success \\"with a white identity.\\"\\" Elizabeth Hayes Turner, an associate history professor at the University of North Texas, wrote that she believed that the author \\"wishes minorities and marginalized whites had crossed boundaries and stood together to transform Dallas from a conservative stronghold to a mecca for liberal forces.\\"Turner, p. 337.

The author makes a reference to Saint Paul, asking the reader to see \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" as a way to correct misconceptions.Cox, p. 969. \\"In his prologue Phillips invites the reader to look \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" for imperfect perceptions of reality and as a lens for locating Dallas. However lyrical that allusion to St. Paul,[...]\\" Chapter 1 discusses slavery during the pre-Civil War period. The majority of the book discusses race relations in subsequent parts of Dallas history. The book discusses historical events such as the 1860 Dallas fire and the subsequent executions and whippings of slaves, violence related to the U.S. Civil War, the Ford Motor Company Strike, and bombings in the 1950s, which all became, by the time of the book's publication, little-known. In the chapter \\"White Like Me\\" Phillips stated that politicians encouraged Jews and Mexican- Americans to reject African-Americans so they could get the social status White Americans had. This chapter discusses a 1950-1951 series of bombings of a neighborhood in South Dallas aimed at African-Americans; a Hispanic man named Pete Garcia was an accomplice. Phillip discusses criticisms of whiteness studies in his afterword; he defends the field of study by offering rebuttals to criticisms, and he also defends the works of David Roediger. In particular he criticizes Eric Arnesen's essay in International Labor and Working Class History Issue 60, Fall 2001, saying that it is a \\"prima facie absurdity\\" that uses too many ad hominems; and Barbara Jeanne Fields's essay in the same issue, saying that he believed that she may not have familiarity with the literature and that she wrongly attributes negative motives to whiteness scholars.Eagles, p. 859.

It covers an ellipse shaped area west of Bazman volcano. The field has erupted lava cones and lava flows, along with some explosive volcanic activity especially in the eastern part of the field. Volcanic rocks in the field are dominated by andesite, with subordinate basalt, dacite and rhyodacite. The volcanism has lasted from 12 million years ago to recent times, the 2010 Hosseinabad earthquake took place within the field but seems to be unrelated to volcanic activity.  Geology and geography  The field has a surface area of , with the shape of an ellipse. This ellipse \\"points\\" to the volcanic arc formed by the Bazman, Taftan and Koh-i- Sultan volcanic arc. The field features well preserved lava cones, associated with lava flows. The basal basaltic lava flows are interlayered with volcanic debris and more silicic lava flows. To a more recent phase of volcanism belong andesitic centres, some of which lie on river terraces and form easily recognizable coulees. Explosive activity has also left ignimbrites and pumices; such explosive activity took place in the eastern part of the field towards Bazman volcano and was accompanied by the formation of nuee ardente breccia. = Petrology and petrogenesis = The field has erupted basalt, which forms several long lava flows in the basal units of the field. Andesites form the bulk of the products with subordinate dacites, as well as some rhyodacites which are found in the eastern part of the field, where the explosive activity took place. The dacites are found in the eastern part of the field. The rocks are porphyritic and follow the calc-alkaline trend, except the basalts which are of the -rich variety. Elemental composition is typical for island arc volcanoes, although content is rather high. The rocks contain phenocrysts of clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene and plagioclase. Amphibole and olivine is also found in the rocks. Some rocks have a glassy composition. These rocks probably formed by subduction of oceanic crust and the interaction of anatexis products thereof with abovelying mantle, with some fractionation of the subsequently formed magma. The basement of the area is formed by even older (Oligocene-Eocene) volcanic rocks that contains intrusions of granodiorite. = Geologic history = The field is of Tertiary-Quaternary age. Pliocene-Quaternary volcanism also took place north of the field where it borders the Lut, a large basaltic coulee of that age is found there and extends from a well preserved volcanic centre. Volcanic activity commenced 12 million years ago and continued until historical times, according to unpublished data by G. Conrad. A minor earthquake occurred on 20 December 2010 of magnitude 6.5 in the field, the 2010 Hosseinabad earthquake. A second earthquake of magnitude 6.2 occurred not far away on 27 January 2011. Little seismic activity is otherwise associated with the field and few faults have been identified there. The formation of fractures in the ground accompanied this seismic activity. These earthquakes occurred at depths of and respectively. The earthquake activity however does appear to be independent from any volcanic activity in the area, although the faults associated with this earthquake may influence the position of vents in the field. = Geological context = Bazman volcano lies east of this field, sometimes it is even included in analyses of the field. Tectonically, the field is located between the Makran mountains in the south, a range formed by Paleocene flysch and older ophiolites, and the Lut block in the north which is a crustal block of Paleozoic-Mesozoic age that is buried beneath more recent sedimentary and volcanic rocks. To the south lies also the Jaz Murian depression. The field is in the Central Iranian volcanic belt, a mountain range with summits exceeding of altitude. In this belt, volcanic activity commenced during the Cretaceous as submarine volcanism. A peak of activity occurred during the Eocene, afterwards andesitic-dacitic stratovolcanoes were formed during the Pliocene- Pleistocene. This volcanism may be associated either with a crustal weakness zone or subduction along the Zagros. Iran has two other volcanic belts, one associated with the Alborz and another at the Lut. Tectonic processes in Iran are ultimately dependent on the northward movement of the Arabic plate with respect to the Eurasian plate.

The area is now part of the city of Hachimantai. The mine opened in 1914 and closed in 1979 leaving a ghost town behind.  History  The Hachimantai Plateau where the mine is located in ≈åu Mountains of central Honshu is a volcanic area and the presence of sulphur deposits was well known from an early age; however, due to the remoteness of the area and difficulty of transport, these deposits were not exploited. Iron pyrites were discovered by local villagers in 1882 in Matsuo village. In 1911, a Yokohama-based trading company, Matsuda-ya, began modern mine development at an altitude of at the base of the peak of Higashi- Hachimantai. In 1934, the Japanese Government Railway Hanawa Line was extended to near the mine, and ≈åbuke Station was established. At one point, the Matsuo mine accounted for 30% of Japan‚Äôs sulphur production and 15% of its pyrite, boasting that it had the greatest production in Asia. In the late 1950s, it was the third largest mine in Japan in terms of tonnage of ore: 469,000 tons of iron ore and 200,000 tons of sulphur.Mine Data.org However, in the 1960s, the demand for sulphur was less, and the production of low-cost sulphur as a byproduct of oil refining and the increasing availability of cheap imported iron ore caused the mine severe economic distress. In order to drastically reduce costs, the conversion to an open pit mine was considered and rejected. In 1969, the company went bankrupt. A new company was formed to concentrate solely on pyrite extraction; however, this venture also failed by 1972 and the mine has been closed since that time. Mine town The Matsuo mine employed 1132 miners in 1920, 4145 miners in 1935, and 8152 miners in 1940. During World War II, an unknown number of conscript Korean labourers were also used. The peak number of employees was 13,594 in the year 1960. Due to the location of the mine, the company had to create a complete city for the workers and to provide numerous welfare facilities such as elementary and junior high schools, hospitals, and music halls. In an era before government public housing, the town had apartment blocks in reinforced concrete with flush toilets and central heating. The town was publicised as a \\"paradise on the cloud\\" to secure workers and their families. After the mine closed, all wooden buildings were incinerated to prevent the possibility of fire, leaving only the reinforced concrete structures. Environmental issues The original vegetation in the area was beech forest. However, due to smoke from sulphur smelting, the soil surrounding the mine has become very acid, and can no longer support most trees.Iwate Prefectural Government Wastewater flowing from the mine is also strongly acidic (ph 2), and includes large amounts of arsenic. As the flow is from 17 to 24 tons per minute, it affects the Kitakami River and Pacific coast of Iwate Prefecture. A waste water treatment plant remains in operation. In popular culture Due to its misty climate the town has been described as the \\"real Silent Hill\\". Adam Dodd of Bloody Disgusting described 11 abandoned buildings in the mist as \\"eerie\\", ranking the location #6 in his article, \\"Eight Terrifying Places Horror Games Should Visit\\".

While he mentions numerous Greek writers (Berossus, Manetho, a mysterious Apollonius, Menander of Ephesus, Herodotus and Thucydides), he shows little sign of any real influence by them,Mittag 2006: 346-348 or indeed of any meaningful education,Gr√ºll, 2014, p.633 possibly only being aware of them through his familiarity with Against Apion by Josephus,Gr√ºll, 2014, p.638-639 whom he refers to as the \\"teacher of the Jews\\".¬ß.3 On the one hand, Josephus is more likely to have been known to a Christian.Gr√ºll, 2014, p.639 The text also contains \\"Biblical allusions\\" and \\"Christian phrases\\".Gr√ºll, 2014, p.638-639 However, the text shows no interest in the churches or holy sites documented by the later Christian itineraria, and is more likely to note a city's \\"gripping games, good wines and pretty women\\", while displaying an \\"obvious affinity\\" for pagan cults and rituals.Grull, 2014, p.638-639 Latin translations One of the surviving translations, from which the more well known title of Expositio totius mundi is derived, is now also lost but was preserved by Jacques Godefroy's 1628 printing of its text. The other, from a manuscript held in a Benedictine monastery in Cava, near Naples, was published in 1831 by Angelo Mai and bears the title Descriptio totius mundi.See M√ºller, 1861. The Descriptio, while more abridged than the Expositio, is nonetheless the only manuscript to contain the beginning of the work. Both manuscripts are printed in Karl M√ºller's Minor Greek Geographers (1861). An English translation, now available online, was made by Jesse Woodman as part of a Master's thesis at Ohio State University in 1964.Woodman, J. E., 1964.

It is a north- south street located to the west of Spadina Avenue, from Front Street West north to Wellington Street. Draper Street is notable for its collection of 28 19th Century Second Empire-styled row cottages. The houses were designated by the City of Toronto government in the 1990s to have heritage status. The entire street is designated as a Heritage Conservation District as a way to preserve its heritage for posterity. The street is named after William Henry Draper, a lawyer, judge, and politician in Upper Canada later Canada West. The street was laid out in an 1856 plan of subdivision by J. Stoughton Dennis of lands that were part of the 1794 Garrison Reserve. Draper and Charles Jones are listed as the property owners of the lots to be subdivided for development. The street is narrow; it is only -wide. The lots are all deep and vary in width from to wide. 28 rowhouses are found on Draper Street. Construction did not begin immediately after the sub-dividing of the properties. In 1857, an economic depression started which may have delayed construction. The one-and-a-half-storey cottages were built from 1881 to 1889 by developer Jonathan Madell. First, seven cottages were built on the east side of the street in 1881, then four cottages on the west side from 1881‚Äì1882. These were designed by architect J. A. Fowler. In 1886, two houses were built on the corners where Draper met Front Street West. In 1889, the row cottages of #20‚Äì32 were built on the west side of the street. In 1997, the residents of Draper Street requested the Board of Heritage Toronto to designate the properties under the Ontario Heritage Act. The Board voted to designate the properties, and Toronto City Council approved the designation on February 4, 1999 under By-law 026-99. Of the original cottages, #19 and #21 had been torn down, #27's facade was replaced and #29's facade was remodelled. The two houses on the north-west corner of Front and Draper were torn down to make a commercial building facing on Front. The areas to the north and east of the street are the site of redevelopment. The condominium project \\"The Well\\" is to be constructed on the industrial lands to the east vacated by The Globe and Mail headquarters. It will convert a vacant lot on Draper Street into a parkette connecting to the project lands. A 16-storey condominium is proposed for the corner of Wellington Street West and Draper. A narrow park is being built, connecting Draper with a nearby development east of the street. The park is just wide and long. A property developer received permission to redevelop that property, if the compensated for the higher density, if they purchased nearby properties, and turned them into parkspace. This short walkway is part of the developer's deal.

Perry March, a lawyer, told police that he had last seen his wife when she left the house on the night of August 15, two weeks earlier, following an argument. He claimed she had packed her bags for a 12-day vacation at an unknown location and driven away. She was never seen alive by anyone else afterwards. Janet's car was found at a nearby apartment complex a week after the police report, apparently having been there for some time. Other evidence began to suggest that Perry had fabricated some evidence of his wife's supposed motive for departure, and attempted to tamper with or destroy other items that might have provided evidence. Police soon reclassified the case as a homicide, despite the absence of Janet's body, and named Perry as a suspect. Shortly afterwards he moved back to his native Chicago area with the couple's two children. After his in-laws won visitation, he fled with the children to Mexico, where his father, Arthur, a former U.S. Army pharmacist, had retired. The case received attention in the national media, where it was the subject of two segments on the CBS News program 48 Hours. For several years afterwards, Perry fought his former in-laws in state and federal court over the administration of Janet's property and the status of his children. Janet was declared legally dead in 2000. Nashville police continued investigating the case and found further evidence suggesting Perry had in fact killed her. In late 2004 a grand jury indicted him on murder and other charges in her death; it was kept secret by police until the following year, when they were able to arrange for him to be arrested in Mexico and extradited to Tennessee to face trial. While he was in jail, police learned that March was conspiring with his father and another inmate to have his in-laws killed; Arthur March was then arrested and extradited himself. After telling prosecutors that he had helped Perry move Janet's body to Kentucky, he agreed to cooperate with them and testify against his son in exchange for a reduced sentence; however he was unable to recall exactly where he had disposed of the body and it has never been found. Arthur's plea bargain was rejected and he died in federal custody shortly after beginning his sentence. Perry was convicted of all charges in 2006, despite the absence of Janet's body. He unsuccessfully appealed the conviction in state court, alleging some of the evidence had been gathered in violation of his constitutional rights. A federal appellate panel reviewing his later habeas petition agreed that the case presented some issues but did not feel it had the statutory authority to overturn the conviction on those grounds; and in any event it found the evidence against Perry had been so overwhelming as to make those issues harmless error. In 2015 the United States Supreme Court denied his certiorari petition, exhausting his appeals. He has maintained his innocence throughout the case, and is currently serving his 56-year sentence at Tennessee's Morgan County Correctional Complex. Background The couple met as undergraduate students at the University of Michigan in the early 1980s. Both Janet and Perry had been educated at exclusive private schools in their respective communities. =Perry and Arthur March= Perry Avram March was born in 1961 to Arthur March, the son of a Romanian Jewish immigrant named Paul Marcovich, who settled in East Chicago, Indiana, with his Chicago-born wife. Arthur became a pharmacist, changing his name to March in 1956 since the U.S. Army, which often called him to duty from the reserves while he worked in healthcare administration, kept misspelling it on checks. His wife, Tziporah, was also of Eastern European descent, having been born in Israel to emigrants from the Belarusian capital city of Minsk. The couple had two other children after Perry. In 1970, Tziporah died under circumstances that are not entirely clear. Her husband said her death was the result of anaphylactic shock brought on by the Darvon she had taken to relieve pain from a head injury. Her state and city death certificates, however, say the death was an accidental overdose. It was widely assumed in the community that Tziporah had taken her own life; doctors later consulted by a Nashville journalist reporting on the case said that anaphylactic shock was similar enough to the effects of suicide by Darvon as to be a credible cover story and that in that era suicides at the decedent's residence were often officially described as accidents. The Marches moved to their vacation home at Michiana, Michigan. Arthur sent Perry to La Lumiere School in La Porte, Indiana, where he excelled in academics and athletics. In his spare time he took karate classes, eventually reaching the rank of first-degree black belt. Arthur March retired in 1978, having attained the rank of lieutenant colonel; his pension was his chief income after that. After graduating with honors, Perry chose to attend the University of Michigan due to the lower tuition he paid as an in-state student, a strong consideration given his father's limited income. He was also attracted by the university's Asian studies program, and made that his major. Those who knew him at Michigan recall him as having some \\"rough edges\\". At the time of the murder, a Michigan alumna came forward and claimed he had hit her in the face while the two were at the school, which Perry denies. =Janet Levine= Janet Gail Levine was born in 1963, to Lawrence Levine, a native New Yorker who had earned undergraduate and law degrees from Michigan, and his wife Carolyn. At the time he was building an insurance defense practice that grew into the firm of Levine, Orr and Geracioti, led him to become one of the most prominent lawyers in Nashville, and made him socially prominent within the city's Jewish community. Janet was the first of their two children. Her goal was to become an artist, perhaps a magazine illustrator. By the time she graduated, she had already exhibited her work in some of the city's restaurants and its Jewish Community Center. After attending the prestigious University School of Nashville, where she had been vice president of her class, she was accepted at her father's alma mater as well. Her friends recalled her as passionate about her interest in art, to the point of embodying common stereotypes of artists. She was known to go to Chicago on shopping trips without much notice. A friend noted that she had not only designed a prototype for a collapsible baby chair, but patented it; however she never attempted to explore its commercial prospects. She was often \\"forgetful and late\\", but friends tolerated her lapses due to her better qualities. However, they also said that she could be difficult to deal with when angered. =The March marriage= At Michigan, Janet studied art. Shortly after her roommate introduced her to Perry March during her sophomore year, she overslept through what was to have been their first date, a trip to the campus synagogue for Rosh Hashanah services. But the two later became inseparable. After his graduation, Perry went to Chicago to work as a futures broker for Oppenheimer & Co.. Janet moved in with him there while taking art classes at the Art Institute. She soon grew homesick, and was able to arrange for her parents to pay Perry's tuition at Vanderbilt University Law School, where he once again excelled academically and became a member of the law review. Classmates there recall him as a driven competitor and tough negotiator who was focused on being financially successful; they joked among themselves that he was the one most likely to someday be indicted for securities fraud. The couple married in 1987 after Janet, tired of waiting for Perry to take that step, proposed to him on her knees in Percy Warner Park. Her parents put up the money for the newlyweds to buy a house in a desirable area of the city. Perry graduated a year later and, despite offers from prominent New York firms, took a job at Bass, Berry & Sims, a Nashville firm specializing in financial matters, where he was one of the first Jews the predominantly WASPy firm had hired full-time. Janet began illustrating children's books. Their first child, a son named Samson, was born in 1990; daughter Tziporah followed in 1994. Arthur March had also come to live in Nashville around this time. After his Michigan house had been foreclosed, Lawrence Levine had bought the property from the bank and leased it back to his son-in-law's father. Arthur later said that Lawrence let him live in the house without paying rent for a while but then encouraged him to move to Nashville to be closer to his son and grandson. However, records in Berrien County showed that Levine ended the lease for nonpayment of rent early in 1987, and sold the house a year later. When Arthur did come to Nashville, the Levines let him live in their house and loaned him money to allow him to establish himself there. Nevertheless, he declared bankruptcy in 1991. During his time in the city, he often told people he had retired from the Army as a full colonel and had served with the Green Berets and on special-forces missions to Israel, a claim contradicted by his service records. 1990s marital difficulties The same year his father went bankrupt, Perry also faced a career setback. A paralegal at Bass Berry found the first of a series of anonymous typewritten letters on her desk, written by a secret admirer who praised her body and said it captivated him; he imagined performing cunnilingus on her for long stretches of time. The writer confessed that he was married and that while he had not previously understood men who had extramarital affairs, he did now even though he still loved his wife and it would break her heart if he did. \\"Marriage has a way of making sex boring at times, routine and old,\\" he wrote. Later notes continued in the same vein and she let the firm's management know. With the help of an outside investigator, they set up a hidden camera monitoring an obscure volume on tax law in the firm's library where the writer asked her to leave a note if she was interested in having an actual affair. It turned out to be Perry, and he was confronted with the choice of resigning or being fired, with the former option available only if he sought some sort of professional help. The paralegal, angry that the firm seemed to be taking its time letting March make up his mind, quit after returning from a vacation; shortly afterwards March was let go. He agreed to pay the woman $25,000 over the next four years, with the first $12,500 half in monthly installments and the last half as a lump sum at the end of that time, to avoid a sexual harassment lawsuit against him and the firm. He kept the payments secret from Janet. Shortly afterwards, he began seeing a marriage counselor with her. By 1993 Perry had admitted to Carolyn Levine, who had taken on the role of a surrogate mother to him since his own mother had died during his childhood, that the couple were having problems in their marriage. His career continued at Levine Orr, his father-in-law's firm, where he represented some locally high-profile clients such as nightclub owners, and sometimes did pro bono work for the city's Jewish Community Center, where he was also a member of the board. Janet continued her artistic career, often taking her lunch alone in local restaurants where she worked with her sketch pad. She remained aloof from her friends and did not discuss her relationship in detail with them, although some said she sometimes seemed depressed. The next year Janet gave birth to a daughter, Tziporah, named after her own mother-in-law who had died long before she met her husband. It was time to move their growing family to a larger house, and they bought a lot in the affluent suburb of Forest Hills on the city's south side, where they spent 1995 building a $650,000 stone house in a \\"country-French\\" style to Janet's specifications. Contractors who worked on the home recalled Janet, who was heavily involved in the project, as particularly difficult. They said she always threatened to go to her husband or her father, who held the note on the house along with his own wife, when there was even a small dispute. When Perry did respond to her calls, they said, he was often more reasonable. 1996 The Marches' marital difficulties worsened following the move. Although Perry had begun seeing a psychiatrist, and Janet sometimes accompanied him on those visits, as well as going on her own, he began to spend nights away from the house. Some friends claimed later that they saw him in the company of other women. He asked a client who owned a popular nightclub in downtown Nashville if he could move into his spare condominium. When Perry was home, he and Janet continued to argue, sometimes in front of the children, which led Carolyn to tell him he had to leave the house if that continued. Perry told her that he believed Janet was considering a divorce. During the summer, the two began seeing the psychiatrist again together, again arguing with each other so vehemently in his office that he suggested a trial separation; Perry later said he had rented a house for that purpose but had not moved into it yet. In one of their last sessions, he recalled, Janet asked Perry if he had told the psychiatrist why he had had to leave Bass Berry, which he had previously explained to the psychiatrist as being due to conflict with a coworker. A neighbor recalled to The New York Times that Perry \\"had a really bad temper\\", getting into a shouting match with an elderly neighbor and yelling at others when they came up the cul-de-sac the new home was at the end of. In mid-August, when the final $12,500 payment to the former Bass Berry paralegal would have been due, he wrote her a letter saying he was having trouble coming up with the money and asking if she could wait until October. Janet may have finally reached the point of ending the marriage. Deneane Beard, the Marches' cleaning lady, recalled seeing a book on divorce on Janet's night table earlier in 1996. On August 14, Ella Goldshmid, the children's nanny, who came two days a week, said that instead of chatting with her on her arrival as she normally did, Janet, more withdrawn than usual, said she would be working on the computer all day, and closed the office door behind her, something she said Janet had never done before. The next day, friends of Janet who saw or talked to her said she also seemed distracted and a little afraid of Perry. Janet and Carolyn made an appointment to see a divorce lawyer on August 16. Disappearance On August 15 two cabinetmakers who had worked on the house during its construction came to the March house in the afternoon to do warranty work, installing two countertops in the kitchen and tightening a faucet. Janet supervised them closely while Perry played with the children. They completed their work within an hour and left, the last people outside her family to have seen Janet. That evening, after the children had been put to bed, Perry, who had spent most of his nights the previous two weeks at local hotels, claims he and Janet started arguing again. Around 8 p.m., he said, he offered to go to a hotel for the night. Instead, he said, she announced she was leaving for a short vacation to somewhere she would not share with him. According to Perry, she packed some clothes into two bags and a suitcase, got into her gray Volvo 850 with her passport, $1,500 in cash and a bag of marijuana. After leaving him a written list of things to do in her absence, he says, she left the house around 8:30 p.m. Shortly after 9 p.m., records show, Perry made phone calls to family and friends telling them Janet had left him and the children. He called first his brother and then his sister, both of whom still lived in the Chicago area. At 10 p.m. he told Laurel Rummel, a lifelong friend of Janet's in whom he had confided about the couple's marital problems as well, that Janet had left. At midnight, he called his in-laws. Carolyn Levine said later that it struck her as unlike Janet to walk out after a fight, but told Perry at the time to have Janet call her whenever she returned. =Aftermath and family investigation= The next morning Janet's absence was noted by several visitors to the house. Beard arrived for her regularly scheduled housecleaning sometime between 8 and 8:30 a.m. She testified later that it seemed the house had already been cleaned, and that Perry told her not to clean the children's playroom. He explained Janet's absence by saying she had gone to California on a business trip. When Ella Goldshmid, the Marches' part-time nanny, arrived between 9:30 and 10 a.m., Perry told her as well that Janet had gone to California, but explained that she was visiting her brother Mark, who at the time was practicing law in Los Angeles. Ella said later that whenever Janet had traveled away from Nashville, she had always let her know in advance and had left instructions behind. Beard had finished what cleaning she needed to do and left the house by the time the next visitor came. Marissa Moody brought her son over for a playdate with Samson March that she and Janet had arranged the day before. When she arrived around 10 a.m., she recalled, neither Janet nor Perry came out of the house to greet them, which made her feel snubbed since she felt the two kept her at arm's length. Samson let them in to the kitchen door, where he told them his mother was not home. Samson, Moody recalled, was bouncing up and down on a rolled-up oriental rug that was on the floor space just outside the kitchen, next to the playroom Perry had told Beard not to clean. She thought this odd since the March house was decorated rather austerely, with the couple preferring exposed hardwood floors with minimal cover. After a few minutes, Samson went to get his father, who apparently had not known about the playdate but told Moody to go ahead with it. When she returned to pick up her son around 2 p.m., Perry was not there; he was instead having lunch with Rummel, with whom he was discussing plans for new carpet for his law office. Rummel said that while they were able to discuss that, Perry was sometimes emotional about Janet and had trouble focusing. Initially the Levines believed Perry's account of their daughter's disappearance. After Marissa Moody had picked up her son, Perry returned to the house and drove his children to their house. He and Lawrence Levine then went to Nashville International Airport to search the parking lots for Janet's Volvo, which they did not find. By Sunday night, August 17, Carolyn Levine began to worry since Janet had never left her children for so long without telling anyone. She wanted to call the police, but Perry and his brother Ron, who had come down from his home to help, persuaded the Levines to wait for the 12-day period that Janet's list for Perry suggested she would be gone for to expire. That night, Perry also called his father, who by this time had moved to a caretaker's cottage on an estate in Ajijic, on Lake Chapala in the Mexican state of Jalisco, a popular destination for many American retirees, particularly former military personnel, due to its low cost of living. Arthur told Perry he would come help him with the children and drove from there to Nashville, arriving several days later. On August 23, the Levines alleged in a later court filing, Perry began seeking to retain the services of a criminal defense attorney. By that time, the end of the week, both Perry and his in-laws were beginning to fear Janet was in trouble, as Samson's sixth birthday party was to be held on August 25, the end of the 12-day period, and no one believed she would voluntarily miss that. Their own efforts to find her had been fruitless. Perry wanted to report her disappearance to the police; he says the Levines did not want to as they feared embarrassing Janet. They in turn later claimed he had resisted calling authorities.Love, Lies and Murder, 2 Samson's birthday party went ahead as scheduled on August 25.Love, Lies and Murder, 7 Guests from outside the family were told a variant of one of Perry's accounts‚Äîthat Janet had been visiting her brother in California, where she had contracted an ear infection that precluded her from flying home until it was cured. Many said later that they accepted this. Arthur March attended his grandson's birthday party, but left for Chicago the next day. When Carolyn Levine asked her son-in-law why, he said his dad \\"ha[d] a big mouth [and] tells everything.\\" Later he exclaimed \\"That fucking Janet has ruined my life!\\" Carolyn had never heard Perry talk that way about his wife before. On August 29, with Janet's whereabouts still unknown after two weeks, the Levines notified the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department (MNPD) that Janet was missing. Janet's alleged list Janet's family found the list she had supposedly given Perry of things to do while she was away to be the most troubling aspect of her disappearance. While she, like Perry, typically organized her instructions to others as lists, many aspects of this list were inconsistent with how she made hers: *Janet, her mother said, usually either wrote out her lists by hand or dictated them for others to write down, instead of writing them on a computer and printing them out; *When she did write, she used lower-case letters exclusively, whereas her list to Perry employed normal capitalization; *Janet typically dated her lists at the top of the page, while the list was dated at the bottom, as Perry more commonly did. The content of the list also raised questions. It did not mention the playdate Janet had scheduled for the following day with Marissa Moody, which Janet's family believes she would have included if she had written the list. Perry later disputed Moody's account, saying he, not Janet, had arranged the playdate. Two members of Janet's family also later testified to incidents that further supported their belief that Perry had actually written the list. According to Carolyn Levine, when she helped Perry put the children to bed on the night after Janet disappeared, she noticed a yellow legal pad next to the Marches' computer with a handwritten list of chores, similar to those on Janet's list. At the top the words \\"two weeks\\" were written in Perry's handwriting and circled. Mark Levine said that on a day when he and Perry had been at his parents' house shortly after Janet's disappearance, he had asked Perry if he could see the list on the Marches' computer. Perry agreed, and the two left for the Forest Hills house in their own cars. Mark said that Perry drove there very quickly and arrived earlier; when he got there the door was locked and Perry let him in only after he had rung the doorbell several times. Perry let him see the file on the computer. He conceded at cross-examination later that he saw from the file's timestamp that it had been saved at 8:17 p.m. on August 15, consistent with Perry's account of Janet's actions that evening. But he also found another file, six pages long, single-spaced and unindented, that appeared to be a list made by Janet of times Perry had wronged her. While Perry told him he could print it out if he wanted, Mark did not know how to do so on the Marches' computer, and Perry did not explain. Mark was never able to print it out at any other time. Later, the police detective who originally investigated the case found the timeframe odd, as well. The 12-day period would have made sense on its face since that would have had her return on Samson's birthday, he agreed. But by the time of her purported disappearance, invitations to Sammy's party on August 25, two days earlier, had been sent out to friends and family. He did not think Janet would have deliberately missed that. Police investigation After taking the Levines' report, detectives looked through local hospital admissions and Janet's credit card and bank accounts, but found no trace of her. Janet's brother Mark had come to Nashville from California by this time, and recalled that shortly after the report was made an MNPD police car came to the Levines' house. Perry, who was also there, became so anxious at the sight that it took him several tries to stand up from his chair due to his uncontrollable shaking. He then asked Mark to call his own brother, Ron. The first break in the case came a little over a week later, on September 7, when Janet's Volvo was found backed into a parking space at an apartment complex roughly from the house. Inside were most of the items Perry said Janet had taken when she left. The detective who processed the Volvo later testified that there was a layer of dust and pollen on the exterior, suggesting it had been parked there, unused, for some time. There were cobwebs in the wheel wells, and when the tires were removed, the brake rotors were found to have rust on them, further confirming this supposition. Inside, police found a purse with Janet's identification, credit cards, passport and $11 in cash; a suitcase packed with clothing and a small canvas bag with toiletry items. A gray suitcase Perry said Janet had taken was not in the vehicle. A 50-dollar bill was in the glove compartment. The front passenger seat had been pushed back, while the drivers' seat was up close to the wheel. On the floor in front of the former detectives found a pair of Janet's white sandals. The footwear appeared to have been \\"carefully positioned\\", they later told a reporter, rather than discarded as a wearer might after taking them off. Investigators also considered it unusual that while Janet's suitcase had been packed with sundresses a woman might wear at that time of year, she had apparently not packed any bras. Nor did her toiletry bag contain any toothpaste or hairbrush. That same day, a private investigator hired by the Levines spoke to Perry. She noted that he referred to Janet in the past tense. After the interview, she went to the apartment complex where Janet's car was found and attempted to speak to residents there about whether they might have seen anyone leave the Volvo there. Perry apparently found out she was doing so and called her, angrily demanding that she fax him a list of everyone she had talked to and what they said after she was done, then hung up. Five days later, the MNPD searched Perry's Jeep. The same detective who had searched Janet's Volvo later testified that hair and fiber evidence was recovered from the back seat. He admitted under cross-examination that the vehicle did not appear to have been cleaned recently, but said he did smell some type of cleaner or disinfectant. On September 10, police interviewed Perry. The detective said he appeared nervous as he was advised of his rights to avoid self-incrimination and refuse consent for a search of his house, rights Perry said he understood as a practicing attorney. He wrote out by hand a statement giving his account of what happened on the night of August 15. Perry took the children to Chicago over the next weekend, September 14‚Äì15, to observe the Rosh Hashanah holiday with his family, although Arthur did not accompany them as Perry said he could not afford the trip. During this time, the MNPD obtained a search warrant for the March house and told March's lawyer on September 16 that they intended to execute it the next day. When they did, they discovered that the computer's hard drive had been forcibly removed and could not be found. The police further investigated Perry's actions since the disappearance. They found that on August 21, almost a week afterwards, he had gone to a local tire store and bought new tires for his Jeep. The tire store owner told them that the existing tires were in excellent condition and he did not see why Perry would have wanted them changed. Perry said he had wanted a different brand. Records also showed that before the disappearance Janet typically used only a Visa credit card and Perry put most of his purchases on a MasterCard, but Janet had not used either since the disappearance while Perry had used both. Suspicion of Perry March Shortly after the search, Perry moved his children to the Chicago area. He rented a house in Wilmette, where his brother lived, and took most of his and Janet's possessions with him. Andrew Saks, a friend who helped him pack on September 18, recalls that Perry seemed businesslike but aggravated at that time. At one point he said that he wanted to \\"fuck the Levines and fuck the Nashville police\\", which Saks found alarming; he noted later that Perry did not respond to his offer to help find Janet. Saks' wife Diane, a longtime friend of Janet's, also later gave testimony to a possibly incriminating remark made by Perry. She was speaking with him on the phone after his move to Chicago when he suddenly asked if she thought he had killed Janet. Before she could answer, Perry elaborated, asking what she might say if he told her that he had put Janet's body in the back of her car, driven away with the children sleeping alone in the house, and returned \\"like nothing ever happened?\\" After that, Andrew told Perry not to call them anymore. By the time Perry left the Nashville area the Levines had come to believe this scenario. Many of the Marches' friends came to agree, since Perry had never returned their calls offering support or reached out to them. After the police announced they were treating the case as a homicide, with Perry as their suspect, local media reported on the case. It preoccupied the Nashville area during Fall of 1996 as no local crime had since the Marcia Trimble rape and murder almost 20 years earlier. The police brought in Army helicopters, divers, cadaver dogs, and thermal imaging devices as they searched the area's woods for Janet's body. Perry's lawyer informed the police his client would no longer cooperate with them and that they would need a warrant for any future searches of his property. Suspicion deepened in November when Perry did not attend Janet's memorial service; a friend who said he was not yet convinced of Perry's guilt was discreetly told by an intermediary that he should not come to visit the Levines while they sat shiva for their daughter, to avoid any awkwardness. In early 1997, the Nashville Scene alternative weekly ran a two- part article about the case that disclosed some new information such as the content of the letters Perry had left for the Bass Berry paralegal in 1991 and the questions about his mother's death. It outlined the police theory of the case at that point: that Perry had killed Janet, in all likelihood unintentionally, perhaps through a hold he might have learned through his karate studies (which an instructor told the Scene he would have been capable of doing at the black belt level), fabricated the list and then taken Janet's Volvo to where it was found, packing his mountain bike in the car so he could return home. They believed he had hidden her body, perhaps initially in the rug Marissa Moody saw (but, at the time, no one else claimed to) and then later somewhere more permanent, possibly with his father's help. Perry was interviewed for the article at his home in Wilmette. He compared himself to Richard Jewell, wrongly suspected of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing that summer, and said that he was arranging financing to buy his father-in-law's share of the house and return to Nashville, where he could start his own law firm. \\"I will not allow one misguided police officer, one vengeful man, and a few low-life journalists to destroy what I've taken years to build,\\" he told the reporter. He also threatened to file defamation suits against the former Michigan classmate who had accused him of assaulting her, The Tennessean newspaper (whose spokesman told the Scene that neither Perry nor his lawyer had complained to the paper about the accuracy of its reporting on the case), and Bass Berry, although Perry's lawyer said he did not think his client would follow through on those threats. Although Lawrence Levine declined to comment, the Scene reported that he was equally committed to seeing that Perry faced justice for killing Janet. None of his friends or law partners would talk on the record. \\"When Larry is lucid,\\" said one who was not identified, \\"all he can talk about is destroying Perry.\\" Civil litigation Perry's determination to emerge triumphant, and his father-in-law's resolve to destroy him, reflected civil litigation between Perry and his in-laws that commenced shortly after his move to the Chicago area. In October, Perry filed a petition in Davidson County probate court to have himself appointed the administrator of Janet's assets in her absence. The Levines opposed this, and filed their own motion, first in Tennessee and then in Cook County, Illinois, family court for grandparent visitation rights, which Perry opposed with equal vigor. In 2003, a Tennessee Court of Appeals judge writing for the majority in the last decision in the case called it \\"[31] months of what can only be described as trench warfare\\";March v. Levine, 896‚Äì905 a dissenting judge agreed that \\"the acrimonious relation of the parties is resplendent in these proceedings\\".March v. Levine, 915 In the probate proceeding, the trial court quickly appointed a conservator to protect Janet's property while the parties resolved their dispute. It warned that given the difficult relationship between them, Janet's liquid assets would soon be depleted if the parties continued, which would force the court to require the sale of personal property to which either or both might ascribe great sentimental value. After Perry moved, the Levines argued that when the court ordered Perry to return some of these personal items, he either did not or returned them in a damaged condition. At one point, they claimed, he had moved some of it to Hammond, Indiana, without telling them until they showed up to pick it up, purely, they alleged, to inconvenience them. Perry also refused to be deposed initially, and then walked out when he was; all these actions led to contempt citations against him, which he initially appealed. The Levines filed their visitation petition at the time Perry moved with his children to Wilmette. Perry argued that their real goal was to allow the police and/or the media to interview Samson, which he did not want to permit (in any event, he claimed, the boy was asleep when Janet left). During an October deposition in the case, Perry invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in response to 15 questions, including when asked if he had killed his wife. This made headlines in the Nashville media and further reinforced the public's perception that he had indeed done so, although legal experts said that was the only thing he could do in that situation. Other evidence that would later be used against Perry came from activities associated with these lawsuits. Carolyn Levine was searching the Forest Hills house in early 1997, after Perry had moved and taken most of the family's possessions to Chicago with him. In the garage, she found two envelopes with the logo of a company only Janet used and her name handwritten on them, both containing typewritten letters. These turned out to be the originals of the ones Perry had sent copies of to the Bass Berry paralegal in 1991, and Carolyn called the police. They theorized that perhaps Janet had discovered these, confronted Perry with them and demanded a divorce that night, which led to his murderous reaction. In March 1999 a court- appointed Chicago-area family lawyer visited Perry at his house to interview him in the visitation case. She testified later that there were no photographs or other mementoes of Janet in the house, which she found disturbing. After she filed a report recommending visitation be granted, she said Perry became angry with her and threatened to disappear with the children to Singapore. Mexico alt=Buildings in a Spanish architectural style amid trees, with a blue body of water behind them and mountains and blue sky in the background The court awarded the Levines visitation late in 1999. When they arrived in Wilmette to pick up the children, however, Ron March, one of his brother's attorneys at that time, told them that Perry had moved with them to his father's residence in Mexico. \\"I brought Perry down here because he didn't have any other place to go,\\" Arthur explained to CBS News later. Within a week of settling down, Perry met a local woman, Carmen Rojas, whom he soon married.Love, Lies and Murder, 4 Back in Nashville, the Levines responded by amending their probate claim to include a wrongful death allegation against Perry. To support it they had Janet declared legally dead. Perry, disbarred earlier that year for misconduct unrelated to his disputes with the Levines, did not appear in court himself, nor retain any lawyer, to defend himself, and so default judgment was awarded to the Levines. He was ordered to pay them $113.5 million, which he then appealed.March v. Levine, 894 =Levines' attempt to retake children= In May 2000, the Levines came to Ajijic to demand that Perry grant them their visitation rights. He and his father refused to let them see the children, and they returned to Nashville. A month later, the Levines returned. This time they had a Mexican court order as well, and they were able to have Perry arrested by Mexican authorities on charges that he had violated the terms of his visa. He was later able to get the charges dropped, but while he was occupied doing so, the Levines went to the children's school, outran a pursuing Arthur March to the airport and took them back to Nashville.Love, Lies and Murder, 5 The visitation order limited them to 39 days with the children, but they immediately began taking steps toward obtaining permanent custody of them.Love, Lies and Murder, 6 While the Levines believed they were acting in accordance with the laws of both countries, Perry considered their action an abduction. Two Tennessee lawyers who agreed with that assessment contacted Perry and agreed to represent him pro bono. They brought an action in federal court to have the children returned to Perry in Mexico under the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, which implemented the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction in U.S. federal law. \\"The bottom line is that this treaty says that you can't steal children and try to make custody determinations in the jurisdiction where you stole them to,\\" Perry told CBS. In response, the Levines argued that they had rightful custody of the children once they returned to the United States due to the visitation order, that the children's habitual residence under the Convention was in Illinois, not Mexico; and that letting them live with Perry again would create a grave risk of harm and violate human rights and international freedoms. They also claimed Perry could not bring the case since he was a fugitive from justice at the time he left for Mexico due to outstanding contempt warrants from the earlier cases. In October, Judge Aleta Arthur Trauger held for Perry. The evidentiary record, she said, established that the children's habitual residence was Mexico at the time. While the Levines believed Perry had killed their daughter and had won a civil judgment against him on those grounds, they never alleged that the children witnessed it and did not otherwise establish a reasonable possibility that they might be harmed in Perry's care. And while Perry did face outstanding contempt citations, that did not meet the criteria established in case law for barring his petition as a fugitive. Therefore, she said, the Levines had to return the children to Perry once the 39 days expired. Trauger stayed her decision so the parties could appeal it to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Levines argued that every aspect of the decision was in error; Perry argued in his cross-appeal that they had no standing to even offer a defense. A three-judge panel heard oral arguments in March 2001; Mark Levine argued for his parents. A month later the panel unanimously upheld the district court. Judge Richard Fred Suhrheinrich wrote that Trauger's opinion had been \\"well-reasoned\\" enough for the appeals court to adopt it in full. Most of his opinion was devoted to elaborating on it and rebuking the Levines. Perry could not have been a fugitive at the time he moved to Mexico, he wrote, since the contempt citations were issued after he went there. He noted that the contempt orders from the probate court stemmed from his failure to return to the Levines a beaded evening bag and a baby blanket, which he called \\"patently insignificant grounds\\" for what he characterized as \\"the Levines' vindictive attempt to deprive March of his day in court.\\"March v. Levine, 470. He also noted that the Levines exceeded the authority of the Mexican court order, which only allowed them to take the children as far as Guadalajara, and that by taking them back to Nashville the Levines and their son had incurred kidnapping charges in Mexico, for which an arrest warrant (later dismissed) had been issued.March v. Levine, 467. =Wrongful death judgment overturned= After the children were returned to him, Perry settled into his life in Mexico, working as a business and financial adviser and starting a cafe with his wife. In 2003 he won another legal victory against the Levines, when the Tennessee Court of Appeals overturned the wrongful-death judgment against him. The two- judge majority found that the Levines had offered no new evidence that Perry had killed Janet when they amended their claim to include wrongful death almost three years into the probate litigation, an undue delay, and that Perry's misbehavior did not warrant a default judgment against him in that case, especially since he had offered to be deposed either by telephone or in Mexico. The majority did, however, deny Perry his motion for dismissal of the wrongful death claim on the merits, since the case was purely procedural. The dissenting judge argued that the majority had too narrowly construed the precedents the trial court relied on, and that the issue of Janet's possible death at Perry's hands had been a part of the proceedings from the beginning. For instance, he noted, the Levines had been barred from asking Perry about it in depositions.March v. Levine, 913‚Äì917 Arrest and jail The resolution of the civil cases in Perry's favor did not deter the MNPD. Despite the continuing absence of her body, two detectives on the department's cold case squad began looking into Janet's disappearance again. Perry's business activities in Mexico had made him some enemies there, where many expatriates who had done business with him accused him of fraud. The detectives learned that in 2001, Perry threatened a Mexican lawyer and his client that \\"he would do away with us the way he did with his wife.\\" In late 2004 the two detectives and prosecutors began secretly presenting evidence against Perry to a grand jury. After hearing 59 witnesses, it returned an indictment on charges of second-degree murder, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. The indictment, like the proceedings that produced it, remained secret while prosecutors worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mexican government to secure the paperwork for Perry's arrest and extradition. In August 2005, Perry was arrested at his restaurant as he prepared to open for the day. He was taken to Guadalajara International Airport and put on a plane to Los Angeles. Once it landed, Mexican authorities turned him over to the FBI and he was arrested on the charges he had been indicted for. The Levines initiated another action for full custody of the grandchildren, which ultimately succeeded. On the plane to Nashville, Perry was escorted by Pat Postiglione, one of the two cold case detectives. Perry began to talk to him, although Postiglione reminded him that he had no legal obligation to do so. Perry said he wanted to talk anyway, and made some admissions related to the case. He told the detective it was \\"time to close this chapter in my life\\" and said he was willing to plead guilty if he could be assured a sentence of no more than seven years. If such an agreement were reached with the prosecution, he promised to be completely honest. Postiglione said he would relay that information to the district attorney's office. \\"Prior to the Janet incident,\\" Perry told Postiglione, \\"I have not been involved in any other criminal-type activity.\\" He asked about what life was like in prison, the difference between maximum and minimum security. Perry also wanted to know about the evidence against him, whether they had discovered Janet's body or not, and posed as a hypothetical question as to whether someone could be guilty of second-degree murder if the death was accidental. While he had loved Janet intensely, Perry told Postiglione, she had been portrayed somewhat idealistically in the media since her disappearance. =Plot to kill the Levines= On his return to Nashville, Perry was housed in the county jail. On his first night, he approached Russell Farris, another inmate who was awaiting trial for attempted murder and some other charges. At first, Perry asked him the same questions he had asked Postglione about how to manage in prison. Later, he told Farris he wanted to talk more privately, which they were able to do through a crack in Farris's cell door. According to Farris, Perry offered to have his bond posted if he would, in return, kill the Levines. Perry hoped to finance the bond by selling property in Mexico or perhaps receiving a cash advance for a novel he had written in 1997, in which a detective investigates the murder of a small, dark-haired woman. After a month of these conversations, Farris told his attorney, and the two went to the police. They arranged for his conversations with Perry to be surreptitiously recorded. Perry gave Farris Arthur's number in Mexico and a list of code words to use so Arthur would know Perry had authorized the call. Farris was later transferred to the jail in neighboring Williamson County, telling Perry he had been released. Perry gave him the Levines' address on a piece of paper. After the transfer, authorities taped five separate phone conversations between Farris and Arthur. The older man told him the right time of day to go to the Levines, where to get a gun, what kind of gun to use, to wear surgical gloves the whole time, and how to get to Ajijic afterwards. The plans seemed to go through as far as having Arthur go to the Guadalajara airport to meet Farris under his assumed name. When he arrived, an FBI agent, who had had him under surveillance, met him and told him the man had been detained by Mexican immigration authorities. Arthur then returned to Ajijic. Back in Nashville, Perry was arrested again and additionally charged with two counts of solicitation to commit murder by the Davidson County prosecutors, and two counts of conspiring to commit murder by federal prosecutors. Arthur, too, was charged with the same offenses by federal authorities but remained in Mexico, officially a fugitive. He claimed entrapment and promised that he would forcefully resist any attempt to extradite him. =Incriminating statements to other inmates= After Farris had been transferred to lead Perry to think he had been released, Perry made the acquaintance of Cornelius King, another inmate whose cell was next to his. He talked with King about his children and his life in Mexico. In one of their conversations, King testified later, Perry told him what had really happened with Janet the night she disappeared. The two had been arguing about his infidelities; she said she was going to get a divorce and \\"take everything.\\" Perry, King said, did not want that, and after that their fight became physical. Perry ultimately hit Janet over the head with a wrench, and claimed that since he had disposed of her body by burning it and pouring the ashes in a lake, he would be acquitted. Another inmate, Reno Martin, had also had a cell next door to Perry. He recalled that one day Perry had returned from one of the child custody hearings visibly agitated. Upset by having to deal with the Levines again, Perry exclaimed \\"it should have been them that he had taken care of instead of ...\\" then suddenly stopped himself. Martin recalled that Perry looked pale afterwards. Trials Perry was a convicted felon even before his murder trial began. In April 2006 he was found guilty of embezzling $23,000 from his father-in-law's firm over the two years before Janet disappeared. Two months later he was convicted of the murder-conspiracy charges. Two months later, almost ten years after Janet's disappearance, Perry's trial began. To avoid the effects of pretrial publicity in the Nashville area, jurors were selected from the Hamilton County pool in Chattanooga, and then taken to Nashville to be sequestered while they heard the case.King, 173. Prosecutors presented a predominantly circumstantial case- in-chief against Perry, augmented by some forensic evidence and the incriminating statements Perry had made to Detective Postiglione, the Mexican lawyer, his jail neighbors and the Sakses. The manuscript of his novel was also entered into evidence. Moody, Goldshmid and Beard testified to what they saw at the March house the morning after. Carolyn Levine testified to the couple's mounting marital problems, her appointment with Janet to see a divorce lawyer that day and Perry's complaint that Janet had ruined his life. Janet's college roommate, who had introduced her to Perry and later moved to Nashville herself to practice medicine, told the jury that Perry had threatened her after she talked to the media, and that she never knew Janet to back her car into a parking space. The prosecution presented several witnesses to convince the jury that Perry had taken the Volvo to the apartment complex himself. A resident who worked for an airline testified that he had returned from work around 1 a.m. and seen a surprised Perry walking a mountain bike past him. The owner of a bicycle shop explained how a mountain bike could be transported in a sedan by using the quick release button to remove the front wheel, and said that a muddy stain on the floor of the Volvo in photographs taken of the car looked consistent with having been left by a bicycle tire. Finally the Volvo salesman who had sold the Marches the car said it was designed to hold a standard mountain bike with the front wheel removed. Another detective said that lab tests had found that mitochondrial DNA in the hair from the back of the Volvo was consistent with samples recovered from Janet's hairbrush. His testimony was complemented by an FBI forensics technician who had analyzed fiber samples from the rear of Perry's Jeep. They were consistent with carpet fibers, and their colors matched those that Marissa Moody had recalled seeing on the rolled-up Oriental rug. The jury was shown a videotape of a deposition given by Arthur March, who had been arrested in January and taken a plea deal on the murder-conspiracy charges of a reduced sentence in exchange for offering evidence against his son. He said he had thought about killing the Levines since at least 2002: \\"They were liars, they were political animals who used her position with the Jewish mafia and his position with the Democratic Party to get what they wanted,\\" which led the Levines to laugh mildly as they watched. He did not have a high opinion of their daughter, either, calling her \\"a typical ... Jewish-American princess ... Anything she wanted, if she needed it, she went to her father. To my knowledge, Perry was there for show purposes.\\" He did, however, further confirm that Perry had killed her that night, and said that he had disposed of the computer's hard drive in the woods at Perry's behest. After that, he offered the first details about what had been done with the body. A few weeks after the murder, he said, Perry had taken him one night to a wooded area on the north edge of the city, a lot whose purchaser he had recently represented, and given him directions to where he had hidden the body in a leaf bag, then driven off. Arthur found it, picked it up, saying it weighed about . After he brought it back to Perry's car, the two drove north to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where they found a motel. While Perry slept, Arthur took his Jeep and drove to the other side of the city. As the dawn broke, he abandoned his original plan to throw it in a creek, since none were deep enough, and instead buried the bag, Janet's clothes, and her skeletal remains within a large pile of brush he found. He was unable to find the location of the pile when prosecutors took him to Bowling Green again after his plea deal, but they nevertheless found his account credible. Perry's defense case-in-chief consisted primarily of attacking King's credibility. Several of the Davidson County jail's correctional officers testified that he had complained about ghosts in his cell and water that ran continuously due to a plumbing problem, and had possibly threatened Perry with physical harm to get extra food from him. His last evidence was a videotape of an interview Samson March had given to a television station in 2000, in which he recalled that his mother had gone to his room and kissed him goodbye as she left, and then he had seen her waving to him as she drove away. The video drew three rebuttal witnesses from the prosecution. Samson's kindergarten teacher at University School of Nashville testified that he had been downcast when he started classes on August 27, despite it being both his birthday and the first day of school. When she asked why, he said he was sad because his mother had left two weeks ago and he hadn't had a chance to say goodbye. A Chicago lawyer who was appointed the children's guardian ad litem in the custody case there said Samson told her that on the night his mother disappeared, he heard his parents arguing from his bedroom, and when he woke up, his mother was gone. Carolyn Levine was recalled and testified that not only had the boy never told her about his mother driving away, he would not have been able to see anything but a vehicle's roof from his bedroom window. =Conviction and sentence= The trial lasted a week. On August 17, ten years and two days after prosecutors alleged Perry murdered Janet, the jury reached a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. They found him guilty on all charges. The Levines expressed their gratitude to the MNPD and prosecutors; Perry's lawyers said they would appeal since the overall case was weak although they admitted the taped conversations between Arthur, Perry and Farris had been very strong evidence. Three weeks later, he was sentenced on all the crimes he had been convicted of that year. Neither Perry nor the Levines made any statement at the hearing, although Mark Levine had one read into the record. Perry received a total of 56 years in prison. A five-year sentence for the theft would run concurrently with 24 years for the murder conspiracy, after which would be a consecutive 32-year sentence for the murder. On the same day Perry was convicted, his father was sentenced. At the time he made his plea agreement, his lawyers and the federal prosecutor had agreed that he would serve 18 months with a longer period of supervised release afterwards. However, the judge rejected that agreement in favor of a five-year sentence. Three months later, on December 21, Arthur died at the federal prison medical center in Fort Worth, Texas. Appeals As they had said they would, Perry and his lawyers appealed his conviction to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA). Their chief claim of error was that the trial court should have suppressed his conversation with Postiglione on the plane from Los Angeles and the taped conversations between himself and Farris, and his father and Farris. All of them, Perry argued, were obtained in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights against compelled self-incrimination and to the assistance of counsel, since at those times he was in police custody after his arrest and indictment. He claimed his conversation with Postiglione had been coerced and his statements not made freely. Nor had he properly waived his right to counsel at that point. And even if he had, he added, the conversations were largely settlement negotiations and thus inadmissible under Tennessee's rules of evidence. His conversations with Farris had mostly, Perry conceded, concerned his attempt to have the Levines murdered, a crime for which he had not been charged at that point, and so those discussions were admissible in the trial on that charge. But statements he had made concerning Janet's murder during those discussions should not have been as they were made without counsel present. The precedents the trial court had relied on in allowing them into evidence had, Perry noted, been abrogated by United States v. Bender, a later decision by the same federal First Circuit Court of Appeals that had decided those precedents. He also argued they served primarily to impeach his character without any relevance to the charged offense. In addition to the constitutional issues, Perry also claimed that the letters he wrote to the Bass Berry paralegal, her testimony, and the draft of his unpublished novel were prejudicial to him to an extent that far outweighed their relevance to the case. Further, he said the tolling of the statute of limitations on the lesser charges associated with Janet's murder during the time after he left the state interfered with his freedom of movement, and denied him equal protection of the laws since it only applied to nonresidents. Lastly, he said, even if none of the trial court's errors were individually enough to justify overturning the conviction, the cumulative effect was sufficiently prejudicial. =State appeal= The TCCA heard the case in 2010. Early the next year it issued its opinion upholding the conviction. Judge Robert Woodall wrote for a unanimous panel of three. On the issue of Perry's conversation with Postiglione, the court found that the facts of the conversation defeated any constitutional claims. The detective had clearly told Perry that he was under no obligation to say anything to him about the crime; Perry had responded that he was an attorney and knew his rights. Also in evidence was Perry's early deposition in the visitation case where he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than a dozen times, showing the appeals court that he knew how to do so should he have wished to. In fact, the court noted, Perry himself had characterized it as \\"two guys having a cordial conversation.\\" Nor was it barred from admission under the evidentiary rule he cited since that had been intended to apply only to settlement discussions of actions. The court found that Perry's conversations with Farris were relevant as they went to the identity of whomever might be responsible for Janet's murder. After a lengthy analysis of various federal and state precedents where police had obtained incriminating statements from jailed defendants plotting with undercover investigators or informants to commit crimes that would improve their evidentiary position in cases pending against them, Woodall reiterated the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in McNeil v. WisconsinMcNeil v. Wisconsin, that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is offense-specific and could not be assumed to apply to statements Perry made about Janet's fate while conspiring with Farris since the two crimes were not closely related enough. Furthermore, Perry's case could be distinguished from those he had cited since in his case there was no evidence the government had initiated the investigation as a pretext to capture incriminating statements about the charge he had been jailed to await trial for. And even if his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights had been violated by the conversation with Postiglione and the tapes from the murder plot, the TCCA noted last, they made up a small portion of the overall prosecution case. If they had been suppressed, a reasonable jury could still have convicted Perry based on the overwhelming circumstantial evidence, rendering their inclusion harmless error. Moving on to the non-constitutional arguments, the court was similarly unpersuaded. The letters to the Bass Berry paralegal, and her testimony, spoke directly to Perry's possible motive in committing the crime, especially since the defense had not objected to the introduction of his 1996 deposition where he had said the payments were not much of an issue between him and Janet. Other than two or three sentences, Woodall added, the letters were not that sexually explicit. As for the novel manuscript, the defense had not objected to its introduction at trial and therefore had waived its right to a consideration of the issue on appeal. The court also rejected Perry's claims on the tolling issue. The case he had cited as a precedent, where the Tennessee Supreme Court had quashed a felony nonsupport indictment of a Texas man who had never visited, much less lived in, Tennessee, was inapposite since unlike that man, Perry had committed his crime in Tennessee and then left the state. The U.S. Supreme Court's Jones v. Helms,Jones v. Helms. in fact, had upheld tolling in a similar non-support case where the defendant had left his original state of residence, just as Perry had. More generally, the state's compelling interest in prosecuting crimes allows the encumbrance of the right to travel created by the tolling; since it applied to anyone who committed crimes in Tennessee and then left the state regardless of whether they lived in Tennessee or not it met the equal protection burden. Nor had Perry shown any evidence that it was enforced against him prejudicially. Since the court had ruled against Perry on every issue he raised, it did not feel there had been any cumulative effect. In July 2011 it denied him permission to appeal the case to the Tennessee Supreme Court. =Federal habeas petition= With no further possibility of appeal in state court, Perry turned to the federal courts. From his cell at the Northeast Correctional Complex outside Mountain City, he handwrote a habeas corpus petition and filed it with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee in Knoxville. It was soon transferred to the Middle District, which covers Nashville, as the more appropriate venue. Kevin H. Sharp, a newly appointed judge, heard the case. Perry added some challenges to his conspiracy conviction to his arguments at state appeal: * The conspiracy indictment accused Perry and Arthur of plotting to have the Levines killed, but the facts introduced at that trial focused on Perry's conspiracy with a fellow inmate acting as a government agent, which cannot lead to a conspiracy conviction; * the jury instructions at that trial also allowed the jury to convict Perry of conspiring with a government agent largely due to the actions of Arthur and Farris; * that a mistrial should have been declared when Lawrence Levine accused Perry of previous uncharged offenses during his testimony; * and lastly that the cumulative effect of the errors above denied him a fair trial. In another petition related to his murder conviction, he focused on the constitutional issues around his conversation on the plane with Postiglione and the statements made during the murder plot that related to Janet's death. He argued that the TCCA erred in assuming he had initiated the conversation on the plane and that the situation of having been under arrest and transported thousands of miles by air was inherently coercive. In June 2013, Sharp denied both petitions, setting down his reasoning in two lengthy memorandum opinions that extensively quoted the TCCA's summary of the trial. While March had indeed exhausted his state remedies, Sharp said, he was constrained by the provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) in his review. Under its terms, he could only overturn a state court's findings if it had applied federal law in an unreasonable or clearly mistaken way. Conspiracy case Sharp reiterated the TCCA's finding that the indictment alleged that Perry and Arthur conspired with each other, and that the identity of any actual killer was not something the state needed to prove as part of its case. This finding, he said, was not inconsistent with any federal law or precedent, since the Supreme Court has never required that states must indict someone facing felony charges, or that a factual variance between the indictment and the case presented was necessarily fatal to a conviction. During his state appeal, Perry had not adequately raised the issue of the jury instructions, Sharp wrote, so he was not allowed to raise them in his habeas petition. But even if he were, the judge continued, he would not have found the issue sufficient to decide in Perry's favor. \\"[T]he jury instructions may not have been a model of clarity and might well have served to confuse the jury,\\" Sharp wrote, \\"[but] the state court's contrary determination rested largely on questions of state law defining the elements of the offenses with which March was charged, which this Court is not in a position to second-guess.\\" Likewise, Perry had not raised the issue of the possible mistrial in state court in a sufficient enough manner to preserve it for appeal, so that claim was denied as well. Again, Sharp took the time to explain why he would likely have denied it had he been able to consider it on the merits. Perry had not shown the \\"manifest necessity\\" for a mistrial required under state law, and federal law in any case did not consider a denial of a mistrial to automatically rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Lastly, following the TCCA, Sharp found that since there had been no error the law allowed him to consider, there could be no cumulative error. He also denied Perry a certificate of appealability, but reminded him that he could still get one from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has appellate jurisdiction over the federal courts of Tennessee. Murder case The next day, Sharp issued another lengthy ruling upholding the murder conviction. The trial record, which he was bound to accept, clearly established that Perry initiated his conversation with Postiglione, and the judge was unaware of any case law that suggested being under arrest and transported to await trial was inherently coercive. There was thus no Fifth Amendment violation. However, he agreed with Perry that his right to counsel had been violated, as he had never been given a full Miranda warning before the conversation took place, and it was not enough for the TCCA to assume that Perry was fully aware of his rights by virtue of having been at one time a practicing attorney. \\"Anyone who watches crime shows on television is likely to be just as aware as March of his right to counsel,\\" Sharp wrote, \\"but this Court is unaware of any exception to the requirement that a defendant be given a Miranda warning before waiving his right to counsel that applies only to lawyers or those who have watched more than their fair share of Law & Order.\\" Nor was Sharp was willing to follow the TCCA in finding no Sixth Amendment violation on the grounds that Perry had initiated the conversation or that Postiglione said he did not consider it a formal interrogation. The state appellate court, he explained, followed the correct precedents but applied them unreasonably. He distinguished those cases from Perry's by observing that in all of them, the defendants had been properly advised of their Miranda rights. However, as the TCCA had concluded, this was harmless error since it was just one of many convincing pieces of evidence in the record. On the matter of the jailhouse conversations, Sharp discussed the precedents relied on by the TCCA at length. While he felt that United States v. Bender, which Perry had argued controlled, was more apposite to the facts of Perry's case than the TCCA court had believed, he ultimately agreed with its conclusion that Perry's right to counsel had not been violated. The TCCA's reading of the relevant Supreme Court precedents, Massiah v. United StatesMassiah v. United States, and Maine v. Moulton,Maine v. Moulton, both of which concerned attempts by the government to use undercover agents or informants to elicit incriminating information from an unknowing defendant about a charged offense, was different from how it had been applied in the other case, but not unreasonably so. And again, the jailhouse conservations were only one of many pieces of evidence. Again, Sharp found no evidence of cumulative error because he had only found one error, and it was harmless. In denying the petition, however, he granted a certificate of appealability due to the Sixth Amendment violation he had found. Perry filed an appeal before the end of the year. =Federal appeal= Three circuit judges‚ÄîEric L. Clay, Damon Keith and David McKeague‚Äîwere empaneled to hear the case. In June 2014, based on a review of the record and the previous decisions, they reached their own decision upholding the district court. Keith wrote for the panel, which considered just the Sixth Amendment questions around the conversation with Postiglione and the jailhouse conversations. On the first, the judges engaged in no analysis of their own, simply assuming for the sake of argument that, as Sharp had found, Perry's right to counsel had been violated. However, they joined Sharp and the TCCA in finding the error harmless due to the weight of the other evidence. The panel had more to say about the jailhouse conversations. Though it ultimately agreed with the district court and the TCCA that their inclusion was harmless error due to the extensive other evidence, it departed from previous reviews in finding that the use of statements incriminating Perry in Janet's murder in recorded conversations between him and Farris at trial was a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The TCCA, and the district court, had been mistaken in applying McNeil and cases that followed it to Perry's case, Keith wrote. Rather, Massiah and Moulton, since they both involved attempts to surreptitiously elicit incriminating statements from defendants already charged, were controlling. And Bender offered the closest set of facts to Perry's case. \\"It was clear that questioning March about the plot to murder government witnesses would result in March making incriminating statements as to the murder charge, for which he was already represented\\" Keith wrote. \\"March had a right to counsel present as a medium if the government planned on using the testimony in his murder case ... we conclude that using his statements to his original murder case was a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\\" This inability to disentangle an investigation into a proposed, uncharged future crime from the investigation into one already charged had led the First Circuit to uphold the district court's decision to suppress that sort of evidence from the defendant's pending trial in Bender. However, the Supreme Court had never considered a case with those facts, and under the AEDPA the Sixth Circuit could therefore not disturb the finding that Perry's rights were not violated. Perry had introduced one more possible ground for appeal, which the panel considered in a footnote. Arthur had testified in his video deposition that the bag with Janet's skeletal remains had weighed, in his estimate, , while the state's expert had said that the bones would have weighed at most. Perry said this violated the \\"physical facts rule\\" under which testimony that contradicts scientific facts or natural principles can be disregarded by a jury. Since Perry had not objected to that statement's inclusion at trial, the court could review it for plain error only. Keith noted that the rug Marissa Moody saw was never otherwise accounted for beyond the fiber evidence, and that Arthur had also testified to there being other objects in the leaf bag besides the bones. Thus, he said, the jury could have reasonably accounted for the discrepancy by assuming that there might have been other objects in the bag. =Supreme Court certiorari petition= Perry had one more possible appeal left. Later that year, he told Nashville's WTVF that he was planning to file a certiorari petition with the Supreme Court. \\"I'm innocent and I'm hopeful that the system will work the way it's supposed to,\\" he said. In June 2015, however, the Supreme Court denied the petition without comment, exhausting Perry's appeals.March v. McAllister, cert den, U.S. Supreme Court; June 8, 2015, 135 S.Ct. 2818, 192 L.Ed.2d 857. Aftermath All of the civil court actions were eventually disposed. Before Perry's murder trial had even begun, the Tennessee Court of Appeals upheld the 2005 juvenile court decision giving the Levines temporary custody of the children. The probate action ended with the court assessing a $220,000 judgement against Perry's brother and sister for dividing possessions of Janet's that Perry had taken with him to Chicago amongst themselves after he moved to Mexico; that was upheld on appeal the following year with permission to appeal further denied in 2008. Later in 2008, the TCCA upheld Perry's theft conviction, but reduced his sentence for the crime to three years since it agreed with him that his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated when the sentence was enhanced based on a fact not determined by the jury. Perry is currently serving his sentence at Morgan County Correctional Complex outside Wartburg. He volunteers his time in the prison's law library, helping other inmates with their appeals. He told the WTVF reporters in 2014 that while he still hears from his daughter Tziporah, who was considering a career as a nurse, occasionally, he had yet to hear from his son, Samson, now an engineer, since his imprisonment. He will not be eligible for parole until 2038. Neither the exhaustion of his criminal appeals nor his disbarment has deterred Perry's appetite for litigation. In 2017 he filed, pro se, a 200-page suit in Middle District federal court against the TDC and Aramark, its food provider, alleging religious discrimination. He claimed the kosher meals he receives are neither nutritious nor properly prepared, and are deliberately done so in an effort to get him to abandon a kosher diet due to past issues with other inmates falsely claiming to be Jewish and thus driving food costs up. Legacy After Perry had been convicted, Lawrence and Mark Levine drafted changes to Tennessee law to remedy what they saw as its shortcomings, based on their experience fighting Perry in family court. They expanded grandparent visitation rights, and allowed judges to terminate custody of parents found criminally or civilly liable for the death of the other parent. After they were introduced into the Tennessee legislature, they were passed quickly by both houses, with unanimous support. Mark would later point to the experience when he successfully ran for a seat in Virginia's House of Delegates in 2015. An art gallery at Nashville's Gordon Jewish Community Center was named for Janet as a memorial.

To know more about this, read the story of Kachan and Devayani.Hanuman retrieves Sanjeevani by taking the entire mountain According to Hinduism Sanjeevani is a magical herb which has the power to cure serious nervous system problems. It was believed that medicines prepared from this herb could revive in any situations where death is almost certain. The herb is mentioned in the Ramayana when Ravana's son Indrajit (Meghnad) hurls a powerful weapon at Lakshmana. Lakshmana is badly wounded and is nearly killed by Indrajita. Hanuman was called upon to fetch this herb from the mount Dronagiri (Mahodaya) or Gandhamardhan hills, far to the north of the Vindhyas on the slopes of the Himalayas. The mountain of herbs is identified as the Valley of Flowers near Badri in Uttarakhand on the slopes of the Himalayas. It is sometimes called Gandhamardan, and at other times Dronagiri. Upon reaching Dronagiri Parvata or Gandhamardan, Hanuman could not identify the herb and lifted the whole mountain and brought it to the battlefield. Several plants have been proposed as possible candidates for the Sanjeevani plant, including: Selaginella bryopteris, Dendrobium plicatile (synonym Desmotrichum fimbriatum), Cressa cretica, and others. A search of ancient texts at CSIR laboratories did not reveal any plant that can be definitively confirmed as Sanjeevani.

Klineberg founded the institute in 2010 with a $15 million gift from philanthropists Richard and Nancy Kinder.  Education  Born in 1940 in New York City, New York, Klineberg earned his B.A. in psychology from Haverford College in 1961 before going on to graduate school at Harvard University. While enrolled there, Klineberg studied at the University of Paris, where he received his M.A., before returning to Harvard to complete his Ph.D. in social psychology in 1966. He served as an assistant professor of social psychology at Princeton University for several years before joining Rice University as an associate professor of sociology in 1972.  Work  Klineberg's work focuses on social change. Driven by the findings of the annual Kinder Institute Houston Area Survey, Klineberg has become an expert on Houston's diversity, arguing that it foreshadows the country's own demographic trajectory. As the survey has expanded from Harris County to include neighboring Fort Bend County and Montgomery County, Klineberg has been frequently cited as claiming that Fort Bend County, to the west of Houston, is the most ethnically diverse county in the country. The survey's annual findings provide insight into the area's religion, economic outlook and attitudes toward a range of issues, including the death penalty, immigration and politics.

The film stars Johnny Galecki, Anna Friel, Oliver Platt, Anjelica Huston, Kyle Gallner, Kevin J. O'Connor, and Diana Bang. It was released on 4 May 2018, by Vertical Entertainment. Plot Depressed and disappointed with his life after losing his job and his fianc√©e, Paul Berger attends a selection seminar for \\"Let‚Äôs Get Pure\\", a secretive self-help program created by Ken Roberts. At the selection meeting, Paul takes an interest in fellow applicant Maggie Jameson. Paul is selected for the program‚Äôs purification retreat. He is hesitant to sign a liability waiver that mentions the possibility of death, but agrees to participate after learning that Maggie was also selected. Paul is escorted by car to the retreat‚Äôs secluded woodland location. There, he meets Fredericks, who has been participating in the program for several weeks. Paul and Maggie also learn that two other applicants, Eric and his girlfriend Laurie, were selected to join the retreat. Lily conducts the program. Each of the new participants is given four personally-formulated cleanse drinks that they are to consume before the end of the first day. Because of their horrible taste, Laurie is unable to finish her fourth drink while everyone else completes the first stage of cleansing. Paul gets sick during the night and throws up in the sink. The next day, a small creature emerges from the sink‚Äôs drainpipe. The creature grows as time goes by. Paul nurtures his creature, realizing it is a physical manifestation of the negativity he purged from his system. Maggie tries to leave the camp when she first confronts her creature, but Lily convinces her to stay. Eric spends time with his creature while Laurie is bedridden with an illness from having not completed her cleanse. Paul discovers Fredericks in battle with his creature, which has grown into a more monstrous form with time, in Fredericks‚Äô cabin. Fredericks insists that the situation is his to handle. Maggie asks Paul to help understand her creature, as it seemingly refuses to bond with her. The two of them discover that their creatures are drawn to each other and also reflect their individual characteristics. Eric drinks Laurie‚Äôs last cleanse drink. His creature tries to eat itself. Paul and Maggie continue getting to know one another. Paul‚Äôs creature unexpectedly bites his finger. Ken Roberts arrives at the camp. Paul and Maggie are summoned to meet him. Ken interrupts his admonishment of Eric for not following instructions to force Maggie into personal reflection. At the conclusion of their conversation, Ken gives Maggie a blade and instructs her to kill her creature to complete the cleanse. Maggie is unable to do it. Maggie runs into the woods. Against Ken‚Äôs command, Paul takes his creature as well as Maggie‚Äôs and goes after her. Paul finds Eric in his cabin grieving over Laurie‚Äôs dead body. Horrified, Paul finds Maggie and explains that they need to leave immediately. Ken and Lily catch up to confront Paul and Maggie. Ken says he will allow them to leave, but insists that they turn over their creatures. Paul takes Ken‚Äôs car keys and continues fleeing. Fredericks is killed by his creature. While Paul drives, Maggie checks on the two creatures in the backseat and discovers them merging into one monster. Maggie is bitten, causing Paul to swerve and crash. When Paul regains consciousness, he sees Maggie trying to kill the fused creature by bludgeoning it with a rock. Paul screams for her to stop before reluctantly realizing it must be killed for their own good. With tears in their eyes, Paul and Maggie strangle the creature with their bare hands, then embrace.

It is located in the Gordon Valley near several other former coal mining communities that also are now ghost towns. It is less than a mile from the ghost town of National, and also quite near to Clear Creek, which has dwindled to a population of 4. History Coal was discovered in the area in 1908, but large-scale mining did not begin until the 1920s. The settlement was originally named Gibson, after Arthur E. Gibson who secured almost 1,500 acres of land sometime before 1920.http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ut- carboncounty2.html#Consumers During the winter of 1921-22, Gibson began to develop a seam of coal, hiring labor to work the mine. By 1924, the Consumers Mutual Coal Company was formed; the town that was originally called Gibson changed its name to Consumers. The Consumers Mine was the first in Utah to use conveyor belts to haul the coal, rather than mine cars.http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ut-carboncounty2.html#Consumers In September, 1927, the company was sold to the Blue Blaze Coal Company. The town shared a post office, school house, hospital and amusement hall with the nearby towns of National and Sweet. Consumers had its own store and a central well. The mine closed in February 1938, although it reopened in October 1939 under new ownership. Sometime in the 1940s, the Hudson Coal Company took ownership of all the coal mining operations in the Gordon Valley area. Modern mining operations continue in the area today, but Consumers itself was abandoned by the end of the 1940s. All that remains today are a few decaying buildings and foundations.http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/ut/consumers.html See also *List of ghost towns in Utah *Coal mining in the United States References Ghost towns in Carbon County, Utah Populated places established in 1921 Mining communities in Utah Ghost towns in Utah ","title":"Consumers, Utah"},{"id":"51254310","title":"Rose Lokonyen"},{"id":"51254345","text":"Cumberland Historic District is a national historic district located at Cumberland, Indiana.

She was employed as a librarian at Harvard University and Boston Athen√¶um, a registrar at American Library Association, and an archivist at Smith College. She invented a charging system, known as the Browne Issue System, for libraries by 1895. She was a member, secretary, and publishing board member of the American Library Association, and was a member of the Massachusetts Library Association.  Personal life  Nina Eliza Browne or Nina Elizabeth, was born in Erving, Massachusetts on October 6, 1860. Her parents were Charles Theodore Browne and Nancy S. Chapman Browne. She lived in Boston and remained unmarried. She was living in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts at the Trinity Church Home, when she died there in 1954 at the age of 94.  Education  Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, about 1921, where she received her bachelor's (1882) and master's degrees (1885) and worked as an archivist, beginning in 1921. Browne earned a bachelor's in 1882 and master's degree in 1885 from Smith College and, at the recommendation of a classmate, attended Columbia College's fledgling School of Library Economy. Browne and forty-three classmaters studied under Melvil Dewey during the two years he taught at Columbia. The class was taught in an erstwhile storeroom, because women were not permitted to enter classrooms. Though Columbia's program did not grant degrees in its early years, in 1889 Dewey (then State Librarian of New York) successfully petitioned on behalf of his students. After completion of sixteen proficiency examinations, a subject bibliography, and a thesis, Browne and one other student were awarded Bachelor of Library Science degrees from the University of the State of New York in 1891. In 1930, Smith College awarded Browne an honorary Doctorate of Letters.

She was an assistant librarian at Columbia University's Library in 1888 to 1889. For the next three years she worked at the New York State Library. She worked at the Library Bureau in Boston until 1896. Her work there was described as follows, \\"The cataloging being done at the Library Bureau, where there is not adequate collection of reference-books, has been hampered by this lack, but for the general accuracy and promptness of the work all praise is due to the energy and enthusiasm of Miss Nina E. Browne, of the Library Bureau.\\" = Browne Issue System = By 1895, she had invented a library book charging system, called the Browne card lending system, or Browne Issue System. In 1897, she gave a speech to the American Library Association entitled, Classification, catalogs, and modern library appliances. She was a speaker in late March 1901 at the Bi-State Meeting of the Pennsylvania Library Club and the New Jersey Library Association. The topic was the practicality of use of cooperative printed cards for libraries. It was decided that this would be most useful and cost-effective for large libraries. At that point, the use of library cards was experimental. = Continued career = William Coolidge Lane, her co-editor on the A.L.A. portrait index, and fellow member of the American Library Association She was co-editor with William Coolidge Lane of the A.L.A Portrait Index, published in 1906.

Browne also created a Catalog of Officers, Graduates, and Nongraduates of Smith College. Widener Library, Harvard University She was an assistant librarian at Harvard University, beginning in 1911, and at the Boston Athenaeum. Browne's career as an archivist began in 1921, when she was hired by Smith College as its first archivist of the Smith College Archives. Browne had been active in the Alumna Association, and material from her time as a student (saved by her mother) formed the basis of the early collection. Though she was initially hired with an eye to the college's 50th anniversary in 1925, she remained in her position long after the event. She became partially blind, which set her retirement in motion in 1937. Browne remained a strong advocate for the archive, asserting its importance and the need for a physical space for the collection. Margaret Storrs Grierson stepped into the role of college archivist in 1940. Library associations Browne was a member of the Massachusetts Library Club, now the Massachusetts Library Association, and encouraged other librarians to perform outreach to the communities to determine their interests. For instance, by 1896, she recommended contacting the heads of labor unions to determine what books their members and other people within the community might enjoy reading. It was said of this effort, \\"Nothing is more needed than to make artisans and the leaders of trade unions believe that the library exists for their benefit, and induce them to use it for informing themselves on economic matters and all questions of the day.\\" She was assistant secretary and then secretary of the American Library Association for many years, beginning in 1889, and was on its publishing board, for a term that was to expire in 1914. Browne was the ALA's registrar from 1889 or 1909. By 1909, she had attended 20 of the ALA's conventions, which were held in cities throughout the United States and two international conventions in London.

His father was an industrialist and he received his secondary education at the Real Instituto Jovellanos; a school devoted to mining and maritime pursuits founded by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos. He first displayed his artistic talents there, copying works from Jovellanos' collection.Brief biography @ the Museo del Prado. Later, he went to Madrid, where he studied at the \\"Escuela Especial de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado\\" (a branch of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando) from 1880 to 1887. His teachers there included the sculptor, and the painter, Ignacio Su√°rez Llanos.Brief biography @ Fundaci√≥n Maxam. After graduating, he participated in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts with a historical painting on the death of Messalina. On that basis, he received a travel stipend from the Diputaci√≥n de Oviedo that enabled him to visit Italy and study at the Accademia di San Luca. In 1890 and 1892, he was awarded second place at the National Exhibition and achieved first-place in 1901. With the support of Florencio Vald√©s (1836-1910, industrialist and co-founder of the newspaper El Comercio) he was able to establish himself in Madrid. He participated in every National Exhibition until 1917 and doubled as a composer, occasionally performing his own works. His cupl√©s have been recorded by, among others, Raquel Meller and Sara Montiel and they appear in the soundtrack of films like The Violet Seller (1958). One of his cupl√©s, \\"Los Amores de Ana\\", recorded numerous times, has been recently recorded by Ana Bel√©n. From 1894 until his death, he was a frequent contributor of illustrations to the magazine, Blanco y Negro. He also exhibited as far afield as Chicago (World's Columbian Exposition, 1893) and Havana (1914). His marriage to a woman from the Canary Islands in 1891 led to work decorating the City Hall in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and his maritime paintings came to be very eclectic, encompassing costumbrista-style scenes, ships new and historical, shorebirds and geological formations. The decline in popularity for these types of paintings after the turn of the century led him to concentrate more on his song writing career although, from 1912 to 1914, he designed a series of calendars that were used by the Spanish Navy. He died in Madrid, aged 57. In 1987, the Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias organized a major travelling retrospective of his works.

He was a militant Trotskyist during the years 1930-40, and was elected to lead the Grand Orient de France (GODF) in 1971, a position he held until 1973.  The interwar period  Coming from a relatively wealthy family, very close to artistic circles, he spent his childhood in Melun and his early studies in Jacques Amyot college. At 15, he bought his first great painting box, that came from a painter of the Barbizon School : Armand Cassagne . He then continued at the School of Decorative Arts in the Rue d'Ulm. He began his socialistic Journey by joining the Socialist Students in 1931, later on the Young Socialists and finally to the SFIO . He soon became a leader of the Socialist Youth, in which he led a trend called \\"revolutionary socialist youth\\" that opposed both the reformist wing more, close to the leadership of the SFIO and aware pro-Trotskyist Bolshevik Leninist close group G√©rard Rosenthal. In 1935, he created a magazine, Revolution, which he ran with a Trotskyist activist, David Rousset . Zeller was to his own astonishment excluded from the Secretary General of Young Socialists of the Seine, by the leadership of the SFIO after the Mulhouse Congress 1935. Seeking political benchmarks, he was persuaded by Jean van Heijenoort to respond to the invitation by Trotsky to join him in Norway, where he was under house arrest. It is this meeting that committed him into joining the Trotskyist movement, within the Internationalist Workers' Party.  War  Opposed to the Munich agreement and Nazism, Zeller became part of the resistance from the start of the occupation. After the armistice of June 1940, Zeller united with the Fourth International Committee of Yvan Craipeau and POI.

Post war  After the war, he briefly joins the Internationalist Communist Party, from September 1946 to the end of 1947, before participating in the creation of the Revolutionary Democratic Rally. He then withdrew progressively from activism to devote himself to painting, painting mainly surrealism and symbolism. In 1948, he retired to Eze, a small village in the French alps, and two years later he created a museum of local history. In 1953 he received the lodge \\"Masonic Vanguard\\" of the Masonic of the Grand Orient of France, Fred Zeller was elected Grand Master of GODF in 1971, a position he held until 1973. He then engaged the main French Masonic obedience on the paths of greater openness to the world. Man of strong convictions, willingly polemicist rebel at heart, he took a firm line, and did not accept compromises. He had meanwhile returned to political activity, but less intensely. Member of the Socialist Party in 1957, he created the brotherly Study Circle and Socialist Action, led by former Trotskyists, and serves as a bridge between the Grand Orient and the SFIO. He is also, until 1960, close to the current Socialist Nation of Auguste Lecoeur and Pierre Herv√©. He died on 7 February 2003 in Bergerac, aged ninety years.

Roberts started out as a reporter but soon moved into photography and was part of the group of photojournalists at The Charlotte Observer who pioneered the use of the 35 mm format cameras. Over the years his work has appeared in Time, Life, Sports Illustrated, and Time Life Books. Roberts is also a prolific writer, both with his first wife, Nancy Roberts and his second wife Cheryl Shelton-Roberts. From 1978 through 1992 he worked for \\"Southern Living\\" magazine, first as director of photography and later as senior travel photographer. Through his work as a photographer he has depicted such significant events as the civil rights movement in the 1960s and rural health initiatives in the 1970s. In later years much of his work has been spent photographing and documenting lighthouses, a subject he has shared through several books he has either co- authored or illustrations with photographs. Roberts and his first wife had two children, Nancy and David. They divorced in the 1980s. Their son David was the subject of their collaborative book \\"David\\" chronicling their experiences of raising a son with Down syndrome. Their daughter Nancy is an attorney. Early years Bruce Stuart Roberts was born on February 4, 1930 in the Bronx adjacent New York suburb Mount Vernon. He became interested in photography around the age of 14, and delivered newspapers to earn money for his hobby. Roberts later recalled how his money went to buying the material he would need to take and develop photographs, creating his own darkroom in the basement and taught himself about photography. He later used his photography skills to pay for his Bachelor of Science degree from New York University, taking pictures at various events such as parties and board meetings. He graduated from New York University in 1951 and joined the US Air Force, serving from 1951 to 1953. After his stint in the Air Force Roberts attended the University of Florida where he completed his postgraduate studies in 1954.

During his early years in North Carolina his photos were published in national and international publications such as Life, Look, Time and the Saturday Evening Post. Many of his photos were used on the cover of The State magazine (now known as Our State). In 1958 he was hired as a staff photographer for The Charlotte Observer newspaper, working for editor Pete McKnight as part of a group of young up-and-coming photographers. The group of Charlotte Observer photographers would be among the first to use 35 mm photography in their work, and would later be credited with being pioneers of the 35 mm camera in photojournalism as well in as the use of natural light for their photos. In 1959 and 1961, Roberts was named \\"Southern Photographer of the Year\\" for his work with the Charlotte Observer. He also took first place in the National Press Photographers Association news pictures competition in 1959, 1960 and 1961. In 1962 Roberts took the position of Director of Photography for the News Journal paper in Wilmington, Delaware, where he remained until 1963.

Regarded as a close assistant of Soviet People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov, Stomonyakov was one of the top political figures in the Soviet foreign affairs bureaucracy, heading up the Soviet foreign ministry's diplomatic relations with Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia from the middle 1920s. He was promoted to Deputy People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs in 1934. Stomonyakov fell under suspicion during the latter days of the Great Purge of 1937-1938 and was arrested by the Soviet secret police in December 1938. After an extensive period of incarceration and interrogation, Stomonyakov was found guilty of being a member of a \\"counterrevolutionary Trotskyite organization\\" and spying for Germany and Poland and was sentenced to death. He was executed on October 16, 1940. Stomonyakov was posthumously rehabilitated by the Soviet government for a wrongful conviction and execution in 1988. Biography =Early years= Boris Spiridonovich Stomonyakov was born 15 June 1882 O.S. in Odessa, Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire. He joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1902, suffering arrest and deportation from the country two years later.Jonathan Haslam, Soviet Foreign Policy, 1930-33: The Impact of the Depression. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1983; pg. 18. Stomonyakov continued his revolutionary activities on behalf of the Bolshevik wing of the RSDLP in exile until 1910, when he abruptly dropped out of the revolutionary movement. He went to Bulgaria in 1915 and was inducted into the Bulgarian Army, fighting against Russia during World War I until 1917, when he was transferred to work in the Bulgarian embassy in the Netherlands. After termination of hostilities in the World War, Stomonyakov returned to Germany, where he began to work for the new Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia. Stomonyakov was named the official trade representative of the Soviet government in Berlin in 1921, a position which he would retain until 1924. =Diplomatic career= In 1924 Stomonyakov relocated to the Soviet Union, taking up a post in the legal department of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs (Narkomindel). His work attracted the notice of Deputy People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov, and Stomonyakov was soon placed in charge of international relations between the USSR and Poland and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. Stomonyakov was made a member of the governing Collegium of Narkomindel in 1926. Stomonyakov was named Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs in 1934. =Arrest, execution, and legacy= Stomonyakov was arrested on 17 December 1938. He was found guilty by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR of participating in a counterrevolutionary Trotskyite organization which spied on behalf of Germany and Poland and sentenced to death. Stomonyakov was executed on 16 October 1940. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1988, during the period of perestroika and critical reexamination of the abuses and crimes of the Soviet past.

Most of the animals in his books are wild animals, who live mainly in the vast wilderness, the hot humid tropical rainforest, the freezing snow-covered mountain, or the surging Lantsang River. The unique landscape and settings in Xishuang Banna has given Shen ample room for creation, as well as material for an original taste of life in the forest. The life of animals is extremely hard. Danger from their natural enemies, competition among the same kind, shortage of food, and hunting by humans have always stood as great threats to their lives. No matter how smart, sly, and strong the animals are, they would eventually be killed by other animals or by people. There are thus numerous traps in Shen‚Äôs jungles, and there is no happy ending or final closure.

Wortman is a retired U.S. federal government administrator who served 27 years in senior-level executive positions in many federal government agencies. He was Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration (SSA) from December 13, 1977 to October 4, 1978. In early 1977, while working at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)‚Äîprecursor to the Department of Health and Human Services‚Äîhe was Chairman of the task force for implementing the reorganization of HEW. This reorganization included the merging of the Medicare and Medicaid programs into a new agency; this agency was named the Health Care Financing Administration (and renamed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in June 2001). He became the first Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration. On two occasions‚Äî6 months in 1975 and the first 3 months of 1977‚Äîhe was Acting Administrator of the Social and Rehabilitation Services, the agency which, at that time, administered the Medicaid program and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. During President Gerald Ford‚Äôs administration in 1975-1976, Wortman played a major role in resettling 60,000 Vietnamese refugees in the U.S. (pursuant to the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act). From 1965 to 1971, he worked at the Office of Economic Opportunity (federal anti- poverty program), where he helped launch Head Start, Upward Bound, and the Community Action Program. Other federal government agencies in which Wortman served as a senior-level executive include the Atomic Energy Commission, the Price Commission, and the Central Intelligence Agency, where he was the deputy director for administration. In several of these posts, he was directed to take over running them, as political appointees left for other positions. In this regard, he was an exemplar of the federal career Senior Executive Service whose members serve as elite executives and leaders who are expected to move between programs and agencies as issues and challenges arise. He was also unique in that, from 1967 until his retirement in 1981, he served in senior- level political appointee positions under both Republican and Democrat presidents. Following his retirement from the federal government in 1981, Wortman served as a consultant at the General Accounting Office (now known as the Government Accountability Office). In 1979, Wortman was elected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), which is an independent, non-profit, non-partisan organization chartered by Congress to assist government leaders in building more effective, efficient, accountable, and transparent organizations. In the early 1980s, he joined NAPA and became its Vice President and its Director of Federal Programs; he continued working at NAPA until 1995. During his time at NAPA, he led many management studies for a variety of federal agencies, studies which were designed to improve the performance of these agencies. In this capacity, he used his government experience and leadership skills to assist hundreds of federal executives. In honoring Wortman in November 2014, NAPA CEO and President, Dan G. Blair, stated, ‚ÄúAt a time when public servants are often caught up in partisan bickering and cross currents in Washington, it is critically important to remember that these hardworking leaders are the ones who make the government work. It is therefore a great honor to recognize one of these public servants, Don Wortman, who served so many, in so many places over his long career.‚Äù Wortman grew up in Lakota, Iowa (born November 10, 1927). He received his bachelor's degree from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, his master's degree in public administration from the University of Minnesota, and attended the Industrial College of the Armed Forces of the National Defense University from 1961 to 1962.

Many Chinese restaurant workers in the United States are from Fuzhou. There are also a number of undocumented Fuzhounese immigrants in the United States who are smuggled in by organizations like the Snakeheads.From Fujian to New York: Understanding the New Chinese Immigration Fuzhounese Americans also helped develop the Chinatown bus lines system, which originated as a means to transport restaurant workers from New York City to various parts of the northeastern United States. Fuzhounese Americans are almost singularly concentrated in the U.S. Northeast, unlike other Chinese Americans and Asian American groups; with the vast majority in New York City and on Long Island, but also in Middlesex and Morris counties in New Jersey and in the Boston and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. Immigration People have immigrated to America from Fuzhou as early as the Qing dynasty period. Some of these people were students who, after completing their studies returned to their home country. After the lifting of emigration restriction from the People's Republic of China in the 1980s, people began leaving the Fuzhou area. Illegal immigration from Fujian province peaked at around 8,000 per month in June 1992. For the second half of 1992 illegal immigration it was about 2500 per month. Migrants were mostly men, but in 1992 around 20-30% of them were women and children. These arrivals were mostly unskilled, agricultural workers. About 80% of these people came from the Changle District of Fuzhou, with smaller numbers coming from Lianjiang and Minhou counties, as well as other places. Businesses =Restaurants= Many Chinese restaurant owners and workers are from Fuzhou. The Chinatown buses system originated as a means to transport workers from New York City to various parts of the East Coast and also parts of the Southeast. Restaurant owners usually adopted the established American Chinese cuisine, which is somewhat based on Cantonese cuisine, rather than serve Fujian cuisine. These restaurants are usually all-you-can eat buffets and take-out restaurants. =Other= Many Fuzhounese people also work in the Chinatown garment industry. With time, however, the Fuzhounese population has become upwardly mobile. Locations Hokchiu people in the US are almost singularly concentrated in the New York metropolitan area, unlike other Chinese Americans and Asian American groups. The number of Fuzhounese in New York City and nationwide is notably difficult to enumerate precisely, since as many as fifty percent of Fuzhounese immigrants are undocumented and may be reluctant to respond to census takers. One estimate had put the number of Fuzhou people in New York City at over 70,000; however, Einhorn in 1994 estimated that as many as 100,000 Fujianese were living in New York at the time and that an additional 10,000 were entering New York each year. Data from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey suggests there are around 1,450 Fuzhou speakers in the United States, although the number is likely to be far greater as most respondents simply wrote \\"Chinese\\". =New York City= Manhattan's Chinatown and Lower East Side During the 1980s, growing numbers of Fuzhou immigrants started arriving into Manhattan's Chinatown. Due to the fact that Manhattan's Chinatown was mostly Cantonese speaking at the time, many could not integrate well into the enclave and as a result, they began to settle on East Broadway and east of The Bowery, which at the time was not fully developed as being part of Chinatown and was rather an overlapping enclave of Chinese, Latinos, and Jewish populations. Many of the earlier Fuzhou immigrants learned to speak Cantonese in order to get a job and interact with the then Cantonese dominated Chinatown. Slowly, the Little Fuzhou enclave emerged on the eastern borderline of Chinatown, which was still overlapped with a remaining Latino and Jewish populations and then eventually it became fully Chinese populated and fully part of Manhattan's Chinatown. However, it resulted in Manhattan's Chinatown becoming subdivided into the older established Cantonese Chinatown in the western portion of Manhattan's Chinatown and newly established Fuzhou Chinatown in the eastern portion of Manhattan's Chinatown; although some long time Cantonese residents, many are older generations and businesses still remain behind in the newly emerged Fuzhou Chinatown. Little Fuzhou (on East Broadway) as seen from the Manhattan Bridge. Hokchiu people have founded business organizations such as the Fuzhou- American Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In 1998, businesspeople from Changle founded the Changle American Association, which has become one of the most influential community organizations. =Shift to Brooklyn, Queens, and Nassau County= However, due to the gentrification situation of Manhattan's Chinatown since the 2000s, the Chinese population and businesses are declining and moving from the original Chinatown to newer Chinatowns in New York, and the Fuzhou immigrants are also part of this decline as well. Many of Chinese in Manhattan's Chinatown are relocating to the newer Chinese enclaves in Brooklyn, Queens, and Nassau County. However, the Fuzhous that are moving out are mostly relocating to Sunset Park, which now has the largest Fuzhou community in all of New York City, while the Cantonese are moving to Bensonhurst, Brooklyn's newer and growing Chinese enclaves, which are more primarily Cantonese populated. Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown Like Manhattan's Chinatown in the past, Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown was primarily Cantonese, but was much smaller and less developed unlike Manhattan's Chinatown, which already had been very large and developed. With the gentrification and lack of available apartment units in Manhattan's Chinatown that came in the 2000s, the growing Fuzhou population shifted to Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown to seek affordable housing and jobs. The shift of the Fuzhou immigration to Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown dramatically expanded the Chinese enclave so prominently that it is now overwhelmingly Fuzhou populated and has far surpassed the size of the Fuzhou enclave in Manhattan's Chinatown. In addition, the Brooklyn Sunset Park Chinatown has overall surpassed the size of Manhattan's Chinatown. Unlike in Brooklyn's Sunset Park Chinatown, where the Fuzhou population has managed to dominate the whole enclave and still quickly growing, the Fuzhou enclave in Manhattan's Chinatown only managed to occupy the eastern portion while the western portion of Manhattan's Chinatown still remains primarily Cantonese. Population =Political views= Compared to previous Chinese immigrants, Fuzhou Americans tend to have a more favorable view of the People's Republic of China.Becoming Chinese American While the majority of the Fuzhou population in the US came directly from Fuzhou, some Fuzhou Americans have also descended from the Hokchiu (Hokchia) diaspora in Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Singapore. =\\"Left behind\\" children= Some Fuzhounese people give birth to children in the US, and then send their young children back to their hometowns because they are unable to raise children and work at the same time. Because of jus soli laws these children automatically gain American citizenship. These children are called \\"left-behind\\" Americans and are usually taken care of by grandparents. They are reunited with their parents in the US once they have reached the age to attend grade school.

Created by Hideo Kojima, designed by Yoji Shinkawa, and based on and played by Stefanie Joosten, Quiet appears in the 2015 action-adventure stealth game, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain as one of the game bosses opposing the protagonist Venom Snake, but can also become an ally who can go on missions with him. The character is a skilled assassin and sniper with superhuman abilities belonging to the covert strike force XOF, a rogue division of the American intelligence agency Cipher. Depending on the player's actions, she can be captured by Venom Snake and eventually used as a member of his Diamond Dogs mercenary group. Quiet's design and character received a mixed response. Many Western critics reacted negatively to Quiet's design, considering it oversexualized, whereas some defended it by citing her backstory. In regards to the visual design, Kojima remarked that he was striving for a unique character, not simply eroticism. Joosten also defended the character in a pre-release interview, asking players to see the story first. Quiet has become a popular character to cosplay. Story and gameplay Within the Metal Gear game series, Quiet appears only in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. When Big Boss awakens in a Cyprus hospital from a coma in 1984, Quiet is one of many soldiers sent by Cipher to kill him. As she is about to kill her target, a man calling himself Ishmael helps fight her off. She is covered in medical grade ethanol and other chemicals and lit on fire until she escapes via a window. Quiet is then seen, deployed to Afghanistan by Skull Face and tasked with eliminating Soviet officers who are against his development of Metal Gear Sahelanthropus. After Venom Snake walks into her line of sight, she proceeds to open fire on him. After defeating her in a fight, the player can choose to kill her or capture her and bring her back to their base. If the latter is chosen, she is tortured in an interrogation but Revolver Ocelot convinces Master Miller not to execute her. It is then possible to eventually use her as a partner on missions. When chosen as a Buddy character, Quiet is most useful as a support providing covering fire during infiltration missions. Quiet's interactions and skills depends on the bond level between her and Venom Snake; she can be equipped with either her standard rifle named Wicked Butterfly, a non-lethal rifle named Guilty Butterfly, firing tranquilizer rounds, or a high-powered lethal rifle named Sinful Butterfly. An unlockable allows the player to unlock Sniper Wolf's uniform from the original Metal Gear Solid for Quiet to wear. Speaking to Code Talker in Navajo, Quiet reveals that Skull Face intended to use her against Venom Snake and his army by having herself be captured so that she could be taken to Mother Base and infect everyone with the English-language strain of chord parasites that she had been given. Quiet was further subjected to \\"parasite therapy\\", whereby parasites were introduced to her body to keep her alive after she was set on fire. It also gives her enhanced strength, mobility and speed as well as inhuman resilience, durability and recovery abilities. Unlike the Skulls unit of parasite-enhanced soldiers encountered through the game, Quiet retains an outwardly-human appearance. Due to her injuries, the parasites compensated for her burned epidermis, giving her the ability to 'breathe' through her skin, requiring her to wear as little clothes as possible, as covering her skin would suffocate her. However, her time spent with Diamond Dogs made her genuinely change sides and she retained her silence to prevent an infection. After a second parasite outbreak occurs on Diamond Dogs' base due to a mutation, Quiet disappears into Afghanistan, realizing that she could never guarantee the safety of Diamond Dogs. Believing that she has betrayed them, Venom Snake follows to investigate. Snake helps her fight off a Soviet regiment, but she is forced to speak English to save him when he is bitten by a venomous snake. Quiet disappears to avoid causing another epidemic; walking alone in the desert, her fate is unknown. The November 2015 release of the Version 1.06 update adds the ability to bring Quiet back in the game. The player needs to complete \\"Mission 11: Cloaked in Silence\\" seven times in a row without killing or leaving Quiet, to unlock a version of the mission titled \\"[Reunion]: Cloaked in Silence\\". Completing this new version of the mission will have Quiet return permanently with all of the equipment she had at the time she left. A 2018 update has turned Quiet into an optional player character in FOB missions online. The playable Quiet's primary weapon remains a sniper rifle. Her superhuman abilities enable her to perform special dashes; she can also drop safely from any height and climb in an instant.  Conception and design  Quiet was modeled after, motion captured and voiced by Dutch model Stefanie Joosten. She received a phone call from her agency to audition as a motion capture actress for an unspecified video game. However, being a big fan of video games she recognized game director Hideo Kojima at the audition and suspected it was for a new Metal Gear game. After getting the role and beginning the motion capture and 3D scanning process, Joosten was shown artwork of the character, which she said looked almost exactly the same as the finished product, but was not told specifically what character she would be playing. The process took two years and, having never held a gun before, she received professional combat training in order to handle several weapons. Although the character does not speak during most of the game, Kojima was so satisfied with Joosten's work that he asked her to 'voice' the character by expressing range of emotions through only groans and hums. \\"Quiet's Theme\\", a humming vocal piece composed by Akihiro Honda and written by Ludvig Forrsell, was sung by Joosten for the game's original soundtrack; she also performed it on stage at The Game Awards 2015. As intended by Kojima, Quiet has become a popular cosplay subject. Pictured, an attendee of Russian video game trade show alt= When asked about Quiet, Kojima replied: \\"In the game, Quiet is the main heroine. Whether she is friend or foe has yet to be revealed so I had to be careful when casting her role. MGS normally has old timers and old guys (laughs). Stefanie is very skilled in action but since she never held that type of gun, we asked her to do some training at home.\\" Speaking about Quiet's design just days after her full reveal in September 2013, Kojima tweeted that he asked lead designer Yoji Shinkawa for a \\"more erotic\\" character; in fact, his original idea of her was her being naked. In response to the reaction to this statement, he clarified: \\"Maybe the phrase 'erotic' wasn't really [the correct word for] what I was trying to say. What I'm really trying to do is create unique characters. One of those is, of course, Quiet. She's a really unique character, I wanted to add that sexiness to her. It wasn't really supposed to be erotic, but sexy.\\" He also said, \\"You're going to notice [when you play,] but there's limited dialogue with [characters], and for that reason we really want to show the characteristic from each character. Sexy could be for guys, weapons, vehicles, it's really that characteristic.\\" Shinkawa added, \\"From my perspective, it's not just the characters, but often I look at a weapon or a vehicle and think 'That's really sexy.' It's not just the characters, but the mechs and weapons [as well].\\" Kojima stated Quiet's design was to appeal to cosplayers and to sell figures; he also made further tweets to demonstrate details of the character to early cosplayers. Kojima said about her clothing, \\"Once you see how she fits into the story, you will understand why she looks the way she does. Without any of this background I can certainly understand why there are concerns. I will say there's a reason she looks the way she does and wears those clothes. And it's all a part of the game, learning those reasons one by one.\\" As noted by Kojima himself, Quiet is the only heroic female character of Metal Gear Solid V, contrasting with the usual three of four in most of his earlier works; he described her as powerful yet vulnerable. He also later compared Quiet to Matilda Lutz's protagonist character from the 2017 rape and revenge action- thriller film Revenge. Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy (see below), but said, \\"When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn't get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.\\" Joosten also talked of pre-release fan theories such as these of Quiet being a sex-changed Chico from the previous prequel games or a young Sniper Wolf, both of which she denied. Kojima later stated in 2015, \\"I know there's people concerning about 'Quiet' but don't worry. I created her character as an antithesis to the women characters appeared in the past fighting game who are excessively exposed. 'Quiet' who doesn't have a word will be teased in the story as well. But once you recognize the secret reason for her exposure, you will feel ashamed of your words & deeds.\\" He added, \\"The response of 'Quiet' disclosure few days ago incited by the net is exactly what MGSV itself is.\\"  Merchandise and reception  Before the release of the game, the presentation of Quiet was criticized for being what was perceived by some as oversexualization and an affirmation of the negative stereotype of the video game industry. Square Enix released Quiet's action figure in the Play Arts KAI series in May 2015. The figure's soft, pliable breasts demonstrated on Twitter by Kojima and Shinkawa, the latter of whom did serve as its production supervisor, were criticized in social media and in the press in the West. She was generally well-received in Japan. AOL Japan noted that the announcement of the \\"erotic\\" figure caused a buzz on Twitter. Famitsu positively commented on the \\"realistic fleshiness\\" of the figure, in addition to focusing on the beauty of the \\"real Quiet\\" Stefanie Joosten and how well the \\"super sexy\\" game character was made to resemble her. A more conventional, 1/6 scale statue of Quiet was released by Gecco Corp in 2016; its review by Dengeki Hobby praised this figure for its high quality and for showing the various aspects of the character's attractiveness and an attention to detail. Another Quiet figure was released by Octohead in 2018. Quiet's portrayal in The Phantom Pain was criticized as oversexualized in the West, but not in Japan. alt= The finished game drew more Western criticism of Quiet's portrayal in both reviews and opinion pieces. GamesRadar David Roberts described Quiet as \\"one of the most complex and conflicted characters in MGS5\\", but that her depiction was an example of a \\"juvenile approach to sexuality\\" that typifies Kojima's work and the Metal Gear series as a whole. Michael McWhertor of Polygon described the justification for Quiet's lack of clothing as \\"inextricably tied to the game's convoluted story\\", and criticized how the game presented other female characters by \\"zeroing in on their jiggling breasts and panning across their asses in a silly, oversexualized way.\\" On the other hand, GameZone's James Wynne felt that the game's story explanation was a valid enough reason for her scantily-clad appearance and succeeds in Kojima's aim to make Quiet \\"a true antithesis to sexy-just-because female characters.\\" He wrote that \\"Fan service doesn't erase the fact that Quiet is a strong, well-written character that doesn't need a man to save her. That puts her on a level comparable to The Boss, who was the most impressive female character to ever grace a video game.\\" Vince Ingenito of IGN called Quiet the most interesting character in the game, writing that her \\"warm, childlike sincerity and battlefield ferocity cause her to steal every scene she's in.\\" He did feel disappointed that she was also \\"required to be a lust-object.\\" In the initial release of the game, some players were disappointed that they lost the option of using Quiet as an ally after completing \\"Mission 45: A Quiet Exit\\". Roberts wrote that few developers would be willing to incur the wrath of players by creating one of the most powerful characters in the game, \\"integrating her completely so as to make her absolutely vital during some particularly difficult missions, then taking her away forever. But it's one of the many ways Kojima is able to express the game's themes ‚Äî of loss, of despair, of that lingering 'phantom pain' right there in the game's title ‚Äî and I respect the hell out of Kojima for removing a core component of gameplay to express those themes.\\" Among those who have portrayed Quiet in cosplay was Maja Felicitas in a widely acclaimed photo session by the photographer eosAndy. Others have included the girlfriend of Oculus Rift creator Palmer Luckey, Nicole Edelmann (Nikki Moxxi), as well as Luckey himself, who both wore their respective self-made costumes in public during a visit to Japan.

The Colorado contest consisted of a series of congressional district conventions on April 2, 7 and 8 and a state convention on April 9. A non-binding \\"beauty contest\\" caucus was held March 1 to coincide with the Super Tuesday conventions. Ted Cruz won a majority of delegates in the convention. Background In the 2012 contest, Colorado held a caucus in order to determine delegate allocation, although the state had traditionally held a non-binding caucus. While the state's Republican Party attempted to hold the traditional non-binding straw poll in 2016 as well, the national GOP prohibited states from holding non- binding straw polls in the 2016 election. In addition, a bill in the Colorado Senate to create a preference primary died in committee. The state of the campaign Despite an early victory by Ted Cruz in the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump was seen as making steady progress towards the Republican nomination at the time. Trump was victorious in 7 of the contests on March 1, with Cruz seen as the only viable threat to Trump after victories in his home state of Texas and 3 other March 1 contests. Marco Rubio performed worse than anticipated on March 1, taking only Minnesota. On March 8, two primaries and a caucus were held in Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi. Despite a poll from American Research Group that showed Kasich leading Trump in Michigan, Trump won all three contests. On March 15's primaries, Donald Trump took four of the five contests- Florida, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina. Trump however was defeated in Ohio by John Kasich 2016 presidential campaign, losing all 66 of the state's delegates. Marco Rubio suspended his campaign after losing the Florida contest, leaving just Cruz and Kasich in the race to oppose Trump. On March 22, Trump won the Arizona contest and all of its 58 pledged delegates, while Cruz capitalized on Trump's comments critical of Mitt Romney's Mormon faith to take the state of Utah and its 40 delegates. On April 1‚Äì3, the North Dakota state convention was held. Capitalizing on a weak ground operation by Donald Trump, Ted Cruz claimed the support of 18 uncommitted delegates to just 1 for Trump. This was considered especially important for Colorado, as neither state had a preference primary and delegates were assigned at state and district conventions. District conventions =1st and 6th district conventions= The district conventions for the 1st and 6th districts took place on April 2. The District 1 slate included former Secretary of State Scott Gessler, state Representative Justin Everett and Tony Sanchez, a candidate for state Senate. All three of the delegates were committed to Cruz- Gessler on the Cruz ticket and the other two on that of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners. The District 6 slate included John Carson, Randy Corporon and Regina Thomson. All three delegates were on the official Cruz slate and were endorsed by Gun Owners of America. =7th district convention= The district convention for the 7th district took place on April 7. Cruz exploited a superior ground game to push forward his slate of Anil Mathai, Libby Szabo and George Athanasopoulos, although only Szabo is officially pledged for Cruz. The 7th district was the first convention in which Trump supporters succeeded in assigning a slate of pledged delegates, although they were defeated by the Cruz supporters. =2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th district conventions= The district conventions for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th districts took place on April 8. The 3rd district, 4th district and 5th district district conventions all ended up with a full slate of Cruz-supporting delegates. These included Melanie Sturm, Anita Stapleton and Brita Horn in the 3rd district, Perry Buck, Guy Short and Kendal Unruh in the 4th district and Joel Crank, Robin Coran and Donald Olmstead in the 5th district. The 2nd district convention appointed one Cruz delegate, Robert Woodward, and two unpledged delegates, Michael McAlpine and Marty Neilson. The conventions were seen to be a large boost to Cruz, and Trump's sloppy organization was seen as a significant obstacle he would have to overcome in order to win the nomination. State convention The state convention took place on April 9. Ted Cruz spoke directly at the state convention, whereas Donald Trump received an invitation but did not attend and John Kasich sent former Governor of New Hampshire John Sununu to speak on his behalf. Cruz took all 13 delegates at the state convention, completing a sweep of all 34 delegates in Colorado as well as the 3 unpledged RNC delegates (although 7 of them were officially uncommitted, they were all seen as leaning for Cruz.) Results Future outlook The Colorado result was considered to be a discouraging result for the Trump campaign, an encouraging result for \\"Stop Trump\\" forces and a strong predictor of how a contested convention would result. Further discouraging results for Trump came in the Wisconsin primary, which was held during the Colorado district conventions. Trump's lack of organization was apparent in the fact that his campaign surrogates failed to create a delegate slate until the third district convention. A contested convention would be similar to a district convention in the need for a strong ground game and winning over unbound delegates, similar to the Colorado process.

It honours the dead of the British Salonika Force as well as commemorating by name the 2171 missing dead of that force who fell in fighting on the Macedonian front during the First World War in the period 1915‚Äì1918.The current CWGC figure for the missing of 2171 is more than the original figure inscribed on the memorial. Located near the village of Doirani in Greece on the south-eastern shores of Lake Doiran, the memorial was placed near the border that then existed between Greece and Serbia, and which is now the border between Greece and North Macedonia. The memorial is near a CWGC cemetery called Doiran Military Cemetery and stands on a mound that was called Colonial Hill (the cemetery was originally called Colonial Hill Cemetery No.2). The location of the memorial is where fierce fighting took place in 1917 and 1918, see Battle of Doiran (1917) and Battle of Doiran (1918). The memorial design by Commission architect Robert Lorimer features four square piers, each bearing name panels, placed to form a square around a central pylon that is some high, bearing the dedicatory inscriptions and two carved lions and stone wreaths. The sculptures are by Walter Gilbert. The cost of the memorial was largely paid for by subscriptions raised from the officers and men who served in the campaign. The memorial, with the main inscriptions draped with British and Greek flags, was unveiled on 25 September 1926 by General Sir George Macdonogh, who represented the British Army. Guards of honour were provided by the Royal Navy (from the ship ) and the Greek Army. Representing the Commission was Sir Frederic Kenyon. In his speech at the unveiling, Macdonogh conveyed the thoughts of Sir George Milne (commander of the British Salonika Force during the war) who had been unable to attend the unveiling. Macdonogh further stated that: The unveiling was followed by a British Marine band playing the hymn Abide with Me, buglers playing the Last Post, and a two-minute silence followed by the laying of wreaths by many representatives including Evzones soldiers laying a wreath on behalf of the President of Greece. Carved wreath and lion, with the English inscription on the memorial's central pylon The main inscription (which is given in both English and Greek) states: An additional inscription (again in English and Greek) states: \\"The land on which this memorial stands, is the free gift of the Greek people for the perpetual commemoration of those of the British Salonika Force who fell in the war 1915‚Äì1918 and are honoured here.\\" In the years that followed, the memorial was visited by several pilgrimages, such as those tours (arranged by the St Barnabas Society) to the Salonika and Gallipoli battlefields. One such visit to the Doiran Memorial was reported in The Times in 1928. The names of those commemorated on the Doiran Memorial were published by the Imperial War Graves Commission in 1929 in two volumes, forming number 37 in their memorial register series. The Doiran Memorial underwent a full structural renovation in 2014, with the work including cleaning of the memorial and replacing and repairing stonework. The 97th anniversary of the end of the Salonika Campaign was marked on 27 September 2015 in a service \\"attended by members of the Greek Army, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence and British military attach√©s\\".

Early life and education Robbins was born in 1930 in Barre, Massachusetts and attended high school in West Springfield, Massachusetts. He later described a high school physics course as an inspiration for his plans for a science career, though he continued to consider following the family tradition by becoming a medical missionary. He settled on biochemistry as his chosen field as an undergraduate at DePauw University, from which he graduated in 1952. He received his Ph.D. in 1955 from the University of Indiana under the supervision of Herbert E. Carter and then became a postdoctoral fellow with Fritz Lipmann, first at Massachusetts General Hospital and then moving with the group to Rockefeller University. Academic career Robbins joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1960 as one of several young biochemists hired by Jack Buchanan into the Department of Biology. There he worked particularly closely with Salvador Luria, studying the structure and biochemistry of lipopolysaccharides. In 1998, after nearly 40 years at MIT, Robbins moved to the Boston University School of Dental Medicine, where he has worked in collaboration with John Samuelson and with two of his own former postdoctoral fellows, department head Carlos Hirschberg and associate dean Maria Kukuruzinska. Robbins received the Eli Lilly Award in Biological Chemistry in 1966, was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1982 and received the Karl Meyer Award for Lifetime Achievement in Glycobiology in 2000. Research Robbins' research has focused on a variety of biochemical pathways. In his early career at MIT, he worked closely with Luria studying the structure and biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides, including elucidating the structure of bactoprenol and identifying the direction of chain elongation in LPS synthesis in bacteria. He later moved on to studying the biochemistry of the eukaryotic N-linked glycosylation pathway and more recently, with John Samuelson, has studied the evolution of this pathway in protists.

During World War II he worked at Bletchley Park as a codebreaker. Early life Kenneth James Le Couteur was born in Saint Helier on the island of Jersey, the son of Philippe Le Couteur, the owner of a carpentry business, and his wife Eva Gartrell. He was educated at Victoria College Preparatory School and Victoria College on Jersey, where he was inspired to become a mathematician by his maths teacher, who had been a wrangler at the University of Cambridge in England. He received a scholarship to study at St John's College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1938. There he studied mathematics, tutored by Ebenezer Cunningham, who had been the senior wrangler in 1902, and rowed for the college. The German occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940 left him stranded in England, cut off from his family. He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1941, winning the Mayhew Prize for the student showing the greatest distinction in applied mathematics. He was recruited by the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park as a cryptanalyst. Le Couteur worked on the Enigma machines, and then the Lorenz cipher, codenamed Tunny by the British. The codebreaking process was partly automated, using Robinson machines and the Colossus computers. After the war ended in 1945, Le Couteur returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of St John's College, where he worked on his doctorate. His academic supervisor initially was Maurice Pryce, but he became the Wykeham Professor of Physics at Oxford University in 1946, and Nicholas Kemmer took over. Le Couteur was awarded a Turner and Newall Fellowship to study at the University of Manchester, where he completed his doctorate in 1948‚Äì49 under the supervision of L√©on Rosenfeld. His thesis, on Meson Theory, was submitted in 1949, and he was awarded his PhD from Cambridge. At Manchester, he began investigation of the evaporation theory of nuclear disintegration. He also met Enid Margaret Domville, who worked there as a librarian. They were married on 14 July 1950. They had three children, all daughters: Caroline, Penelope and Mary (Avinashi), and a foster daughter, Marion Chesher. Academic career Le Couteur became a lecturer in physics at the University of Liverpool in 1949. There he continued developing relativistic wave equations and working on his evaporation theory. He also provided theoretical physicist support of the work of the experimentalists working on the university's 37-inch cyclotron, and collaborated with Ernest Titterton from the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) in Harwell, Oxfordshire. His work on the Peeler-Regenerative Beam Extraction Method brought him renown, and his solution was employed in the design of subsequent cyclotrons. He also became known for his work on the statistical model of excited nuclei, which he would continue to pursue in Australia. In 1956, Mark Oliphant recruited Le Couteur as the foundation Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Australian National University in Canberra. When Le Couteur arrived, the faculty of the department consisted of himself and Frederick Barker. He enjoyed the new location, sailing and rock fishing on the nearby South Coast of New South Wales, and sailing on Lake Burley Griffin after the lake was filled in 1964.

Eyre Creek is a locality in Southland, New Zealand, situated to the north-east of the Five Rivers Plain. It lies on , 18 km (11 miles) north of Lumsden. On its northern side is the Jollies Hill Pass (396m, 1300 ft), commonly known as the Jollies, which skirts the western flank of the Mid Dome. Jolly Waggoners The first settlement in the area was in early 1863 when P. K. Bracken, Thomas Crawley and John Groves built the Dome Pass Accommodation House, known as the Jolly Waggoners.Southland Times, 30 October 1863, p.5 This was just north of the junction of the roads from Riverton, Invercargill and Dunedin and was a popular resting place for waggoners as a night of good fun and a jolly time could be enjoyed.Hamilton, Alistair (1995), Where Five Rivers Run, Five Rivers History Committee, p.25 Crawley sold it to John Heath in 1867. By 1871 Donald McLean was the licensee and the hotel was in serious decline. On the opposite side of the road to where the hotel was sited is a small graveyard where four people who died around the time the hotel was open are buried. Two of these are known. Margaret Smith died in 1865 after the coach she was travelling in overturned in the creek at Parawa, while in 1871 James Cameron died after eating tutu in the bar of the hotel. A cairn beside State Highway 6 commemorates these early pioneers. Eyre Creek Station In 1859 Eyre Creek Station was taken up, originally being run as an extension of the neighbouring Five Rivers Station. However, when Dalgety, Rattray and Company took it over in 1868 they built a manager's cottage at what is now known as Eyre Creek. The stream itself was on the northern side of the property and doesn't run through the locality. In 1873 William Larnach bought the 45,100 acre station for ¬£25,000. He later sold part of his interest to Henry Driver, before they sold, in 1879, to the New Zealand Agricultural Company,Southland Times, 18 February 1879, p.2 of which they were both directors. The company was not a financial success but gradually disposed of parts of the property. Over the years a number of company managers were based at Eyre Creek before the homestead block was sold to John Gibson in 1902.Otago Witness, 12 March 1902, p.18 The current Eyre Creek Station, a small remnant of the original, has its homestead closer to Athol. Railway The Kingston Branch railway opened through the area on 28 January 1878 and soon after a siding was built at Eyre Creek. The station, at 1093 ft above sea level, was the highest on the branch line. In July 1939 a train from Lumsden to Kingston got stuck in an eight-foot snowdrift at Eyre Creek. Although it was eventually freed the train was forced to spend the night there. It took two further days for it to eventually reach its destination. The branch line closed on 26 November 1979. The Around the Mountains Cycle Trail follows some of the trackline through Eyre Creek. A replica of the old station sign has been erected on its former site.

It was commonly known as the \\"Grand Old Duchess\\". Despite surviving the Bombing of Darwin and Cyclone Tracy, the hotel was demolished in 1999. A bar at the rear of the original site formerly known as the Hot & Cold Bar now functions under the name Hotel Darwin. History The Green Room at the Hotel Darwin The Hotel Darwin was designed by D. K. Turner of Messrs. Stephenson and Turner. It was built on the site of the old Club Hotel at a cost of between ¬£50,000 and ¬£85,000. Two hundred people attended the opening of the hotel, which was officiated by Northern Territory Administrator Charles Aubrey Abbott. His wife Hilda Abbott opened the doors with a golden key, which is now on display at the Defence of Darwin Experience. Controversy erupted when several prominent Darwin figures did not receive an invitation. This was described as: > a very serious matter. These influential men might think that they have been > deliberately ignored... the Post Office official cannot be too severely > censured for their negligence. In 1947, the Communist Party petitioned to turn the Hotel Darwin into a community hotel, which was signed by more than 300 people. Paspalis and Stanley Thomas Laurance were successful in their tender for the hotel. In 1948, Lawrance was charged for failing to display a price list. The publican stopped serving beer while the case was before the courts, a period in the hotel's history described as \\"beerless, cheerless days\\". The Hotel Darwin featured 'The Pickled Parrot', a piano bar and a fine dining restaurant called 'The Green Room'. Demolition By the 1990s, the Hotel Darwin reportedly was \\"riddled with cancer\\" and was \\"structurally unsafe\\". The owners, Paspalis Hotel Investment group, announced their intention to demolish it on 9 September 1999 after receiving two reports \\"confirming serious doubts about the structural integrity of the building\\". The National Trust of the NT called for Planning Minister Tim Baldwin to intervene through use of the Heritage Conservation Act. A Supreme Court injunction on 10 September failed to stop the building's destruction, which began almost immediately after the ruling. Outraged protesters tried to save the hotel and police tried to defuse the situation. By the morning of 11 September the Hotel Darwin had been demolished in what was seen by many as an act of vandalism.

The character is an insomniac with a split personality, and is depicted as an unnamed everyman (credited in the film as \\"the Narrator\\") during the day, who becomes the chaotic and charismatic Tyler Durden at night during periods of insomnia. In 2008, Tyler was selected by Empire magazine as the greatest movie character of all time. When the list was redone in 2015, he placed at number 8. Appearances =Novels= Pursuit of Happiness (1995) The Narrator first appeared in a seven-page short story in the 1995 compilation Pursuit of Happiness. This story later became chapter six of the novel Fight Club, which Palahniuk published in 1996. Fight Club (1996) In the 1996 novel, the Narrator is depicted as an average middle-class man employed at an unnamed automobile company, wherein he inspects car accidents to determine if an automobile model should be recalled. Suffering from insomnia and depression, he begins visiting support groups for people with illnesses that he is not afflicted with himself. This induces catharsis within him, enabling him to sleep. When an impostor named Marla Singer begins to appear at the groups, his euphoria is broken and his insomnia returns. The Narrator meets a man named Tyler Durden while alone on a nude beach, and begins living with him after his condominium explodes due to unknown causes. The duo establish a weekly meeting known as \\"fight club\\", in which they and other men can engage in bare-knuckle fistfights. After Marla calls their residence, threatening suicide, she and Tyler begin an affair that confounds the Narrator. Tyler initiates a cult-like organisation known as Project Mayhem in order to aggressively promote his anti-consumerist ideals, but the Narrator becomes increasingly uneasy with the group as its activities become more destructive. The Narrator learns that he and Tyler are, in fact, the same person, as the Narrator's mind formed a new personality that was able to escape from the issues that plagued his life. With the help of Project Mayhem, Tyler plans to destroy a skyscraper and a national museum using homemade explosives. Tyler plans to die alongside the Narrator as a martyr during the event. Attempting to stop Tyler's plan, the Narrator ascends to the roof of the building, where Tyler holds him at gunpoint. When Marla arrives on the roof with one of the support groups, Tyler vanishes, as Tyler \\"was his hallucination, not hers.\\"Palahniuk, Fight Club, 1999, p. 195. With Tyler gone, the Narrator waits for the explosives to kill him. However, the bomb malfunctions, as Tyler mixed paraffin into the explosives. Still alive and holding Tyler's pistol, the Narrator makes the choice to shoot himself. Later, he regains consciousness in a mental hospital, believing he is in Heaven, and imagines an argument with God over human nature. The novel ends with the Narrator being approached by hospital employees who are actually members of Project Mayhem. The Narrator does not have a name in the novel, yet is often referred to as \\"Joe,\\" due to his quotes such as \\"I am Joe's [blank]\\". These quotes refer to the Narrator's reading old Reader's Digest articles in which human organs write about themselves in first-person perspective. Fight Club 2 (2015) In the comic book sequel Fight Club 2, the Narrator goes by the name of Sebastian.Fight Club 2 #1, Chuck Palahniuk & Cameron Stewart, Dark Horse Comics, May 2015 Set ten years after the original novel, the Narrator is depicted as working for a private military contractor, while he and Marla are married and have a nine-year-old son named Junior. After Junior is killed in a house fire, it is revealed that the Narrator's mother and father both died in two other separate fires. Unlike in the film, Tyler's appearance is based on a personal friend of the author, depicted as having \\"shoulder-length-Jesus blond hair.\\" His temper is somewhat kept under control through the Narrator's medication. Fight Club 2 provides a new, drastically different explanation for Tyler: the Narrator discovers that Tyler is not merely his own split personality, but essentially, a sort of meme who can spread from one person to another. The current host of the \\"Tyler Durden\\" personality damages the life of a younger child with the express purpose of causing the stress factors that will give rise to a new \\"Tyler Durden\\" personality in them when they grow up, thus allowing \\"Tyler Durden\\" to achieve a sort of functional immortality. The Narrator's therapist has pieced this together through hypnosis sessions, explaining to him that the Narrator's own father and grandfather were hosts, and that \\"Tyler\\" was involved in shaping Marla's life as well‚Äî\\"breeding them like cattle\\" for generations, so the Narrator and Marla could in turn produce a son, who would be Tyler's host in the next generation. Junior only faked his death in the fire, as he is slowly being taken over by his Tyler Durden just as his father was. The Narrator has to race to stop \\"Tyler\\", even though he cannot truly kill him without killing both his son and himself. Fight Club 3 (2019) =Film= Edward Norton as the Narrator (left) and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden (right). In the 1999 film Fight Club, based on the Palahniuk novel and directed by David Fincher, the Narrator is portrayed by Edward Norton while Tyler is played by Brad Pitt. The actors began preparation for their roles by taking lessons in boxing, grappling, taekwondo, and soapmaking. Pitt made the decision to visit a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so that the character of Tyler would have imperfect teeth. The pieces were restored after the film's production concluded. The film's portrayal of the Narrator and Tyler is similar to that of the novel, with some differences. Unlike the novel, the two meet during a plane flight rather than on a nude beach, and the cinematic incarnation of Tyler does not murder anyone, unlike the literary version. Furthermore, while the novel ends with the Narrator in a mental hospital, the film concludes with the Narrator and Marla in a skyscraper, overlooking the skyline that is detonating due to Project Mayhem's explosives. Like in the novel, the Narrator does not have a name, though the script refers to him as \\"Jack\\".Uhls, Jim; Fight Club screenplay; http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Fight-Club.html While the novel features the Narrator referring to himself as \\"Joe\\" from Reader's Digest articles, the film adaptation replaces \\"Joe\\" with \\"Jack\\". =Video games= In the 2004 video game Fight Club, developed by Genuine Games and released by Vivendi, the Narrator is voiced by Dave Wittenberg while Tyler is voiced by Joshua Leonard. Reception In 2008, Tyler was selected by Empire magazine as the greatest movie character of all time. When the list was redone in 2015, he placed at number 8.

The album was re-released on Intense Millennium Records in 2011. Critical reception The album was reviewed by Harvest Rock Syndicate, Heaven's Metal and YouthWorker in the years 1991-1992. The website \\"Classic Thrash\\" wrote \\"After some radical line-up changes Vengeance Rising were back with only Roger Martinez left of the original group, which probably had a serious impact on the new album. Destruction Comes demonstrates a much more streamlined sound with very little of the previous variety left. It is unarguably quite a lot more one-dimensional in comparison to the old, even considering that the new band were able to maintain a constant speed in a respectable way. Everything pretty much follows the same formula, complete with nearly identical tempo and vocals on almost every track. After the first couple of songs have passed you effectively fail to notice any real difference between the rest, and by the end of the album you've probably given up paying any attention a long time ago. Maybe Destruction Comes is not a total loss after all, but it can be surprisingly tiresome to listen to it even halfway through.\\" Cross Rhythms writer Tony Cummings gave the album a two out of ten, stating \\"Vengeance Rising (originally Vengeance) were quite the white metal team everyone was talking about, but after a sparkling debut album was followed by a pretty dire one, they now complete the decline with an album which has all the noise and aggression but none of the subtlety.\\" Track listing Personnel ;Vengeance * Roger Martinez - vocals, bass, rhythm guitar, producer, mixing * Derek Sean - lead guitar * Chris Hyde - drums ;Production * Eddie Schryer - mastering * Gil Morales - engineer, mixing * Craig Brock - assistant engineer * Brandon Harris - assistant engineer References 1991 albums Vengeance Rising albums Frontline Records albums ","title":"Destruction Comes"},{"id":"51255897","text":"The Boys who Challenged Hitler: Knud Pederson and the Churchill Club is a 2015 non-fiction book written by Phillip Hoose.

Biography Fereydun was kidnapped at a young age, and spent more than seven years in captivity. Finally, he was bought as a gholam by merchants acting on behalf of the Safavid royal court. Afterwards, he was promoted to the position of the keeper of the king's armor (qurchi-e zereh), and by that became part of the expanding number of gholams within the royal household (). In late October 1605, during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1603-1618, amidst a period of heavy fighting in Azerbaijan against the Ottomans, a Kurdish prisoner from the Mokri tribe attempted to murder king Abbas I. However, Fereydun Khan Cherkes managed to save his life. As a reward for his bravery, Abbas I appointed him in either December 1605 or November 1606 as the governor of the Astarabad province. During a part of the Safavid era, including Fereydun Khan Cherkes' tenure, the Astarabad province encompassed most of today's provinces of Golestan, Semnan, and North Khorasan. Fereydun's main task as a governor was to ensure the safety and protection of the Astarabad province from the various Turkmen nomads of Khwarezm, as well as from those indigenous Turkmens of the northern fringes of the Astarabad province. They were keen on expanding their territory and to carry out raids often ‚Äî the latter which caused major problems for the rural and urban people who were living close to these border regions of the Safavid realm. As a result, he had to conduct several wars against these nomads on the northern fringes of the province. These successful wars led by Fereydun (as well as a brief coverage of his early life) were described by Mo·∏•ammad ·π¨ƒÅher b. ·∏§asan (·∏¥ƒÅdem-e Bes·π≠ƒÅmi‚Äô) in his short history entitled Fotu·∏•ƒÅt-e Fereyduniyeh. He was succeeded as governor by Behbud Khan Cherkes.
