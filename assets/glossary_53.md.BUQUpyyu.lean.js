Glucose is the starting product in the ED pathway and through a series of enzyme assisted chemical reactions it is catabolized into pyruvate. Entner and Doudoroff (1952) and MacGee and Doudoroff (1954) first reported the ED pathway in the bacterium Pseudomonas saccharophila. While originally thought to be just an alternative to glycolysis (EMP) and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), some studies now suggest that the original role of the EMP may have originally been about anabolism and repurposed over time to catabolism, meaning the ED pathway may be the older pathway. Recent studies have also shown the prevalence of the ED pathway may be more widespread than first predicted with evidence supporting the presence of the pathway in cyanobacteria, ferns, algae, mosses, and plants.Chen, Xi, et al. \\"The Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff pathway is an overlooked glycolytic route in cyanobacteria and plants.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (2016): 201521916. Specifically, there is direct evidence that Hordeum vulgare uses the Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff pathway. Distinct features of the Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff pathway are that it: * Uses the unique enzymes 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase aldolase and 2-keto-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase and other common metabolic enzymes to other metabolic pathways to catabolize glucose to pyruvate. * In the process of breaking down glucose, a net yield of 1 ATP is formed per every one glucose molecule processed. As well as 1 NADH and 1 NADPH. In comparison, glycolysis has a net yield of 2 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules per every one glucose molecule metabolized. Though studies suggest this difference in energy production may be offset by the difference in protein amount needed per pathway.  Archaeal variations  Archaea have variants of the Entner-Doudoroff Pathway. These variants are called the semiphosphorylative ED (spED) and the nonphosphorylative ED (npED): * spED is found in halophilic euryachaea and Clostridium species. * In spED, the difference is where phosphorylation occurs. In the standard ED, phosphorylation occurs at the first step from glucose to G-6-P. In spED, the glucose is first oxidized to gluconate via a glucose dehydrogenase. Next, gluconate dehydratase converts gluconate into 2-keto-3-deoxy-gluconate (KDG). The next step is where phosphorylation occurs as KDG kinase converts KDG into KDPG. KDPG is then cleaved into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate via KDPG aldolase and follows the same EMP pathway as the standard ED. This pathway produces the same amount of ATP as the standard ED. * npED is found in thermoacidophilic Sulfolobus, Euryarchaeota Tp. acidophilum, and Picrophilus species. * In npED, there is no phosphorylation at all. The pathway is the same as spED but instead of phosphorylation occurring at KDG, KDG is instead cleaved GA and pyruvate via KDG aldolase. From here, GA is oxidized via GA dehydrogenase into glycerate. The glycerate is phosphorylated by glycerate kinase into 2PG. 2PG then follows the same pathway as ED and is converted into pyruvate via ENO and PK. In this pathway though, there is no ATP produced. Some archaea such as Crenacraeota Sul. solfacaricus and Tpt. tenax have what is called branched ED. In branched ED, the organism have both spED and npED that are both operative and work in parallel. Organisms that use the Entner- Doudoroff pathway There are several bacteria that use the Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff pathway for metabolism of glucose and are unable to catabolize via glycolysis (e.g., therefore lacking essential glycolytic enzymes such as phosphofructokinase as seen in Pseudomonas).Conway,T. (1992) \\"The Entner- Doudorodd pathway: history, physiology and molecular biology\\" Microbiology of Reviews 103(19; May), pp. 1-28, DOI , see Genera in which the pathway is prominent include Gram-negative, as listed below, Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis, as well as several in the Archaea, the second distinct branch of the prokaryotes (and the \\"third domain of life\\", after the prokaryotic Eubacteria and the eukaryotes).Br√§sen C.; D.

Due to the low energy yield of the ED pathway, anaerobic bacteria seem to mainly use glycolysis while aerobic and facultative anaerobes are more likely to have the ED pathway. This is thought to be due to the fact that aerobic and facultative anaerobes have other non-glycolytic pathways for creating ATP such as oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, the ED pathway is favored due to the lesser amounts of proteins required. While anaerobic bacteria must rely on the glycolysis pathway to create a greater percentage of their required ATP thus its 2 ATP production is more favored over the ED pathway's 1 ATP production. Examples of bacteria using the pathway are: * Pseudomonas, a genus of Gram-negative bacteria * Azotobacter, a genus of Gram- negative bacteria * Rhizobium,Kuykendall, L. David; John M.

To date there is evidence of Eukaryotes using the pathway, suggesting it may be more widespread than previously thought: *Hordeum vulgare, barley uses the Entner-Duodoroff pathway. *Phaeodactylum tricornutum diatom model species presents functional phosphogluconate dehydratase and dehoxyphosphogluconate aldolase genes in its genome Fabris M., et al., \\"The metabolic blueprint of Phaeodactylum tricornutum reveals a eukaryotic Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff glycolytic pathway \\", The Plant Journal (2012) 70, 1004‚Äì1014 The Entner‚ÄìDoudoroff pathway is present in many species of Archaea (caveat, see following), whose metabolisms \\"resemble... in [their] complexity those of Bacteria and lower Eukarya\\", and often include both this pathway and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway of glycolysis, except most often as unique, modified variants.  Catalyzing enzymes  = Conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate = The first step in ED is phosphorylation of glucose by a family of enzymes called hexokinases to form glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction consumes ATP, but it acts to keep the glucose concentration low, promoting continuous transport of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane transporters. In addition, it blocks the glucose from leaking out ‚Äì the cell lacks transporters for G6P, and free diffusion out of the cell is prevented due to the charged nature of G6P. Glucose may alternatively be formed from the phosphorolysis or hydrolysis of intracellular starch or glycogen. In animals, an isozyme of hexokinase called glucokinase is also used in the liver, which has a much lower affinity for glucose (Km in the vicinity of normal glycemia), and differs in regulatory properties. The different substrate affinity and alternate regulation of this enzyme are a reflection of the role of the liver in maintaining blood sugar levels. Cofactors: Mg2+ = Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucanolactone = The G6P is then converted to 6-phosphoglucanolactone in the presence of enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase( an oxido-reductase) with the presence of co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) which will be reduced to nicotineamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen along with a free hydrogen atom H+ = Conversion of 6-phosphoglucanolactone to 6-phosphogluconic acid = The 6PGL is converted into 6-phosphogluconic acid in the presence of enzyme hydrolase. = Conversion of 6-phosphogluconic acid to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphoglucanate = The 6-phosphogluconic acid is converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) in the presence of enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase in which water molecule is released to the surroundings. = Conversion of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphoglucanate to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate = The KDPG is then converted into pyruvate or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the presence of enzyme KDPG aldolase. when KDPG is converted into pyruvate, the ED pathway for that pyruvate ends here and then the pyruvate goes into further metabolic pathways (TCA cycle, ETC cycle, etc). The other product (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) is further converted by entering into the glycolysis pathway and at last get converted into pyruvate for further metabolism. = Conversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate = The G3P is converted to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate int the presence of enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (an oxido- reductase). The aldehyde groups of the triose sugars are oxidised, and inorganic phosphate is added to them, forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. The hydrogen is used to reduce two molecules of NAD+, a hydrogen carrier, to give NADH + H+ for each triose. Hydrogen atom balance and charge balance are both maintained because the phosphate (Pi) group actually exists in the form of a hydrogen phosphate anion (HPO42‚àí), which dissociates to contribute the extra H+ ion and gives a net charge of -3 on both sides. = Conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate = This step is the enzymatic transfer of a phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP by phosphoglycerate kinase, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. = Conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate = Phosphoglycerate mutase isomerises 3-phosphoglycerate into 2-phosphoglycerate. = Conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenol pyruvate = Enolase next converts 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate. This reaction is an elimination reaction involving an E1cB mechanism. Cofactors: 2 Mg2+: one \\"conformational\\" ion to coordinate with the carboxylate group of the substrate, and one \\"catalytic\\" ion that participates in the dehydration = Conversion of phosphoenol pyruvate to pyruvate = A final substrate-level phosphorylation now forms a molecule of pyruvate and a molecule of ATP by means of the enzyme pyruvate kinase. This serves as an additional regulatory step, similar to the phosphoglycerate kinase step. Cofactors: Mg2+ References Further reading * Br√§sen C.; D. Esser; B. Rauch & B.

The concept is ancient and in early Sanskrit and Pali texts, it meant any arrangement of space or facilities for pleasure and entertainment. The term evolved into an architectural concept wherein it refers to living quarters for monks with an open shared space or courtyard, particularly in Buddhism. The term is also found in Ajivika, Hindu and Jain monastic literature, usually referring to temporary refuge for wandering monks or nuns during the annual Indian monsoons. In modern Jainism, the monks continue to wander from town to town except during the rainy season (Chaturmas), the term \\"vihara\\" refers their wanderings.Goma·π≠e≈õvara sahasrƒÅbdƒ´ mahotsava dar≈õana, Niraj Jain, ≈örava·πáabelagola Digambara Jaina Muzaraƒ´ Ins·π≠ƒ´·π≠yu≈õa·πÉsa Maineji·πÖga Kame·π≠ƒ´, 1984, p. 265Tulasƒ´ praj√±ƒÅ, Jaina Vi≈õva BhƒÅratƒ´, 1984, p. 29 Vihara or vihara hall has a more specific meaning in the architecture of India, especially ancient Indian rock-cut architecture. Here it means a central hall, with small cells connected to it sometimes with beds carved from the stone. Some have a shrine cell set back at the centre of the back wall, containing a stupa in early examples, or a Buddha statue later. Typical large sites such as the Ajanta Caves, Aurangabad Caves, Karli Caves, and Kanheri Caves contain several viharas. Some included a chaitya or worship hall nearby.Michell, George, The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India, Volume 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu, p. 67 and see individual entries, 1989, Penguin Books, The vihara was originated to be a shelter for Monks when it rains. Etymology and nomenclature VihƒÅra is a Sanskrit word that appears in several Vedic texts with context-sensitive meanings. It generally means a form of \\"distribution, transposition, separation, arrangement\\", either of words or sacred fires or sacrificial ground. Alternatively, it refers to a form of wandering roaming, any place to rest or please oneself or enjoy one's pastime in, a meaning more common in late Vedic texts, the Epics and grhyasutras.Vihara, Monier Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically Arranged, Oxford University Press, p. 1003 Its meaning in the post-Vedic era is more specifically a form of rest house, temple or monastery in ascetic traditions of India, particularly for a group of monks. It particularly referred to a hall that was used as a temple or where monks met and some walked about. In the context of the performative arts, the term means the theatre, playhouse, convent or temple compound to meet, perform or relax in. Later it referred to a form of temple or monastery construction in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, wherein the design has a central hall and attached separated shrines for residence either for monks or for gods, goddesses and some sacred figure such as Tirthankaras, Gautama Buddha, or a guru. The word means a Jain or Hindu temple or \\"dwelling, waiting place\\" in many medieval era inscriptions and texts, from vi-har which means \\"to construct\\". It contrasts with or , which means \\"forest\\".Vihara, Pali English Dictionary, T. W. Rhys Davids, William Stede, editors; Pali Text Society; p. 642 In medieval era, the term meant any monastery, particularly for Buddhist monks. Matha is another term for monastery in Indian religious tradition, today normally used for Hindu establishments. The northern Indian state of Bihar derives its name from vihƒÅra due to the abundance of Buddhist monasteries in that area. The word has also been borrowed in Malay as biara, denoting a monastery or other non-Muslim place of worship. It is called a \\"wihan\\" () in Thai, and vihear in Khmer. In Burmese, wihara (, ), means \\"monastery,\\" but the native Burmese word kyaung (, ) is preferred. Monks wandering from place to place preaching and seeking alms often stayed together in the sangha. In the Punjabi language, an open space inside a home is called a 'vehra'. In Korea, Japan, Vietnam and China the word for a Buddhist temple or monastery seems to have a different origin. The Japanese word for a Buddhist temple is , it was anciently also written phonetically Â§©ËâØ tera, and it is cognate with the Modern Korean Ch«íl from Middle Korean Tiel, the Jurchen Taira and the reconstructed Old Chinese *d…òia Å, all meaning \\"Buddhist Monastery\\". These words are apparently derived from the Aramaic word for \\"monastery\\" dƒìrƒÅ/ dairƒÅ/ dƒìr (from the root dwr \\"to live together\\"), rather than from the unrelated Indian word for monastery vihara, and may have been transmitted to China by the first Central Asian translators of Buddhist scriptures, such as An Shigao or Lokaksema. Origins Cave 12, Ellora, a late multi-story rock-cut vihara. Further decoration of the pillars was probably intended. =Viharas as pleasure centers= During the 3rd-century BCE era of Ashoka, vihara yatras were travel stops aimed at enjoyments, pleasures and hobbies such as hunting. These contrasted with dharma yatras which related to religious pursuits and pilgrimage.\\"He now undertook what were described as 'dharma yatras' instead of the usual royal 'vihara yatras'. Vihara yatras were marked by pleasures such as the hunt\\" in After Ashoka converted to Buddhism, states Lahiri, he started dharma yatras around mid 3rd century BCE instead of hedonistic royal vihara yatras. =Viharas as monasteries= The early history of viharas is unclear. Monasteries in the form of caves are dated to centuries before the start of the common era, for Ajivikas, Buddhists and Jainas. The rock-cut architecture found in cave viharas from the 2nd-century BCE have roots in the Maurya Empire period. In and around the Bihar state of India are a group of residential cave monuments all dated to be from pre-common era, reflecting the Maurya architecture. Some of these have Brahmi script inscription which confirms their antiquity, but the inscriptions were likely added to pre-existing caves. The oldest layer of Buddhist and Jain texts mention legends of the Buddha, the Jain Tirthankaras or sramana monks living in caves. If these records derived from an oral tradition accurately reflect the significance of monks and caves in the times of the Buddha and the Mahavira, then cave residence tradition dates back to at least the 5th century BCE. According to Allchin and Erdosy, the legend of First Buddhist Council is dated to a period just after the death of the Buddha. It mentions monks gathering at a cave near Rajgiri, and this dates it in pre-Mauryan times. However, the square courtyard with cells architecture of vihara, state Allchin and Erdosy, is dated to the Mauryan period. The earlier monastic residences of Ajivikas, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jains were likely outside rock cliffs and made of temporary materials and these have not survived. The earliest known gift of immovable property for monastic purposes ever recorded in an Indian inscription is credited to Emperor Ashoka, and it is a donation to the Ajivikas. According to Johannes Bronkhorst, this created competitive financial pressures on all traditions, including the Hindu Brahmins. This may have led to the development of viharas as shelters for monks, and evolution in the Ashrama concept to agraharas or Hindu monasteries. These shelters were normally accompanied by donation of revenue from villages nearby, who would work and support these cave residences with food and services. The Karle inscription dated to the 1st century CE donates a cave and nearby village, states Bronkhorst, \\"for the support of the ascetics living in the caves at Valuraka [Karle] without any distinction of sect or origin\\". Buddhist texts from Bengal, dated to centuries later, use the term asrama- vihara or agrahara-vihara for their monasteries. Ajanta, a large vihara hall for prayer and living, 5th century Buddhist viharas or monasteries may be described as a residence for monks, a centre for religious work and meditation and a centre of Buddhist learning. Reference to five kinds of dwellings (Pancha Lenani) namely, Vihara, Addayoga, Pasada, Hammiya and Guha is found in the Buddhist canonical texts as fit for monks. Of these only the Vihara (monastery) and Guha (Cave) have survived. At some stage of Buddhism, like other Indian religious traditions, the wandering monks of the Sangha dedicated to asceticism and the monastic life, wandered from place to place. During the rainy season (cf. vassa) they stayed in temporary shelters. In Buddhist theology relating to rebirth and merit earning, it was considered an act of merit not only to feed a monk but also to shelter him, sumptuous monasteries were created by rich lay devotees. Architecture The only substantial remains of very early viharas are in the rock-cut complexes, mostly in north India, the Deccan in particular, but this is an accident of survival. Originally structural viharas of stone or brick would probably have been at least as common everywhere, and the norm in the south. By the second century BCE a standard plan for a vihara was established; these form the majority of Buddhist rock-cut \\"caves\\". It consisted of a roughly square rectangular hall, in rock-cut cases, or probably an open court in structural examples, off which there were a number of small cells. Rock-cut cells are often fitted with rock- cut platforms for beds and pillows. The front wall had one or more entrances, and often a verandah. Later the back wall facing the entrance had a fairly small shrine-room, often reached through an ante-chamber. Initially these held stupas, but later a large sculpted Buddha image, sometimes with reliefs on the walls. The verandah might also have sculpture, and in some cases the walls of the main hall. Paintings were perhaps more common, but these rarely survive, except in a few cases such as Caves 2, 10, 11 and 17 at the Ajanta Caves. As later rock-cut viharas are often on up to three storeys, this was also probably the case with the structural ones.Harle, 48, 54‚Äì56, 119‚Äì120; Michell, 67 As the vihara acquired a central image, it came to take over the function of the chaitya worship hall, and eventually these ceased to be built. This was despite the rock-cut vihara shrine room usually offering no path for circumambulation or pradakshina, an important ritual practice.Harle, 132; Michell, 67 In early medieval era, Viharas became important institutions and a part of Buddhist Universities with thousands of students, such as Nalanda. Life in \\"Viharas\\" was codified early on. It is the object of a part of the Pali canon, the Vinaya Pitaka or \\"basket of monastic discipline\\". Shalban Vihara in Bangladesh is an example of a structural monastery with 115 cells, where the lower parts of the brick-built structure have been excavated. Somapura Mahavihara, also in Bangladesh, was a larger vihara, mostly 8th- century, with 177 cells around a huge central temple. Cave 12, Ajanta Caves, cell entries off a vihara hall =Variants in rock-cut viharas= Usually the standard form as described above is followed, but there are some variants. Two vihara halls, Cave 5 at Ellora and Cave 11 at Kanheri, have very low platforms running most of the length of the main hall. These were probably used as some combination of benches or tables for dining, desks for study, and possibly beds. They are often termed \\"dining-hall\\" or the \\"Durbar Hall\\" at Kanheri, on no good evidence.Michell, 359, 374 Cave 11 at the Bedse Caves is a fairly small 1st-century vihara, with nine cells in the interior and originally four around the entrance, and no shrine room. It is distinguished by elaborate gavaksha and railing relief carving around the cell-doors, but especially by having a rounded roof and apsidal far end, like a chaitya hall.Michell, 351‚Äì352  History  Mahabodhi Temple in India. The earliest Buddhist rock- cut cave abodes and sacred places are found in the western Deccan dating back to the 3rd century BCE. These earliest rock-cut caves include the Bhaja Caves, the Karla Caves, and some of the Ajanta Caves. Vihara with central shrine containing devotional images of the Buddha, dated to about the 2nd century CE are found in the northwestern area of Gandhara, in sites such as Jaulian, Kalawan (in the Taxila area) or Dharmarajika, which states Behrendt, possibly were the prototypes for the 4th century monasteries such as those at Devnimori in Gujarat. This is supported by the discovery of clay and bronze Buddha statues, but it is unclear if the statue is of a later date. According to Behrendt, these \\"must have been the architectural prototype for the later northern and western Buddhist shrines in the Ajanta Caves, Aurangabad, Ellora, Nalanda, Ratnagiri and other sites\\". Behrendt's proposal follows the model that states the northwestern influences and Kushana era during the 1st and 2nd century CE triggered the development of Buddhist art and monastery designs. In contrast, Susan Huntington states that this late nineteenth and early twentieth century model is increasingly questioned by the discovery of pre- Kushana era Buddha images outside the northwestern territories. Further, states Huntington, \\"archaeological, literary, and inscriptional evidence\\" such as those in Madhya Pradesh cast further doubts.Susan L. Huntington (1990), Early Buddhist Art and the Theory of Aniconism, Art Journal, Volume 49, 1990. Issue 4: New Approaches to South Asian Art, pp. 401‚Äì408 Devotional worship of Buddha is traceable, for example, to Bharhut Buddhist monuments dated between 2nd and 1st century BCE. The Krishna or Kanha Cave (Cave 19) at Nasik has the central hall with connected cells, and it is generally dated to about the 1st century BCE. The early stone viharas mimicked the timber construction that likely preceded them. Inscriptional evidence on stone and copper plates indicate that Buddhist viharas were often co-built with Hindu and Jain temples. The Gupta Empire era witnessed the building of numerous viharas, including those at the Ajanta Caves. Some of these viharas and temples though evidenced in texts and inscriptions are no longer physically found, likely destroyed in later centuries by natural causes or due to war. =Viharas as a source of major Buddhist traditions= Viharas found at Thotlakonda As more people joined Buddhist monastic sangha, the senior monks adopted a code of discipline which came to be known in the Pali Canon as the Vinaya texts. These texts are mostly concerned with the rules of the sangha. The rules are preceded by stories telling how the Buddha came to lay them down, and followed by explanations and analysis. According to the stories, the rules were devised on an ad hoc basis as the Buddha encountered various behavioral problems or disputes among his followers. Each major early Buddhist tradition had its own variant text of code of discipline for vihara life. Major vihara appointed a vihara-pala, the one who managed the vihara, settled disputes, determined sangha's consent and rules, and forced those hold-outs to this consensus. Three early influential monastic fraternities are traceable in Buddhist history. The Mahavihara established by Mahinda was the oldest. Later, in 1st century BCE, King Vattagamani donated the Abhayagiri vihara to his favored monk, which led the Mahavihara fraternity to expel that monk. In 3rd century CE, this repeated when King Mahasena donated the Jetavana vihara to an individual monk, which led to his expulsion. The Mahinda Mahavihara led to the orthodox Theravada tradition. The Abhayagiri vihara monks, rejected and criticized by the orthodox Buddhist monks, were more receptive to heterodox ideas and they nurtured the Mahayana tradition. The Jetavana vihara monks vacillated between the two traditions, blending their ideas. =Viharas of the PƒÅla era= The ruins of Shalvan Vihara, the Buddhist monastery that operated between 7th-12th century in what is now Mainamati, Bangladesh. A range of monasteries grew up during the PƒÅla period in ancient Magadha (modern Bihar) and Bengal. According to Tibetan sources, five great mahaviharas stood out: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura, OdantapurƒÅ, and Jagaddala. According to Sukumar Dutt, the five monasteries formed a network, were supported and supervised by the Pala state. Each of the five had their own seal and operated like a corporation, serving as centers of learning. Other notable monasteries of the Pala Empire were Traikuta, Devikota (identified with ancient Kotivarsa, 'modern Bangarh'), and Pandit Vihara. Excavations jointly conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India and University of Burdwan in 1971‚Äì1972 to 1974‚Äì1975 yielded a Buddhist monastic complex at Monorampur, near Bharatpur via Panagarh Bazar in the Bardhaman district of West Bengal. The date of the monastery may be ascribed to the early medieval period. Recent excavations at Jagjivanpur (Malda district, West Bengal) revealed another Buddhist monastery (Nandadirghika-Udranga Mahavihara) of the ninth century. Nothing of the superstructure has survived. A number of monastic cells facing a rectangular courtyard have been found. A notable feature is the presence of circular corner cells. It is believed that the general layout of the monastic complex at Jagjivanpur is by and large similar to that of Nalanda. Beside these, scattered references to some monasteries are found in epigraphic and other sources. Among them Pullahari (in western Magadha), Halud Vihara (45 km south of Paharpur), Parikramana vihara and Yashovarmapura vihara (in Bihar) deserve mention. Other important structural complexes have been discovered at Mainamati (Comilla district, Bangladesh). Remains of quite a few viharas have been unearthed here and the most elaborate is the Shalban Vihara. The complex consists of a fairly large vihara of the usual plan of four ranges of monastic cells round a central court, with a temple in cruciform plan situated in the centre. According to a legend on a seal (discovered at the site) the founder of the monastery was Bhavadeva, a ruler of the Deva dynasty. =Southeast Asia= Vihara, locally called wihan, of Wat Chedi Luang in Northern Thailand As Buddhism spread in Southeast Asia, monasteries were built by local kings. The term vihara is still sometimes used to refer to the monasteries/temples, also known as wat, but in Thailand it also took on a narrower meaning referring to certain buildings in the temple complex. The wihan is a building, apart from the main ubosot (ordination hall) in which a Buddha image is enshrined. In many temples, the wihan serves as a sermon hall or an assembly hall where ceremonies, such as the kathina, are held. Many of these Theravada viharas feature a Buddha image that is considered sacred after it is formally consecrated by the monks.

The Lieutenant Governor of Alberta is appointed in the same manner as the other provincial viceroys in Canada and is similarly tasked with carrying out most of the monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties. Salma Lakhani is the current Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. On August 26, 2020, she was installed as the 19th Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, becoming the first South Asian and Muslim in Canadian history to hold the role. Role and presence The Lieutenant Governor of Alberta is vested with a number of governmental duties and is also expected to undertake various ceremonial roles. The lieutenant governor, him or herself a member and Chancellor of the order, will induct deserving individuals into the Alberta Order of Excellence and, upon installation, automatically becomes a Knight or Dame of Justice and the Vice-Prior in Alberta of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem. The viceroy further presents other provincial honours and decorations, as well as various awards that are named for and presented by the lieutenant governor; these are generally created in partnership with another government or charitable organization and linked specifically to their cause. These honours are presented at official ceremonies, which count amongst hundreds of other engagements the lieutenant governor partakes in each year, either as host or guest of honour; in 2006, the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta undertook 328 engagements and 280 in 2007. At these events, the lieutenant governor's presence is marked by the lieutenant governor's standard, consisting of a blue field bearing the escutcheon of the Arms of Majesty in Right of Alberta surmounted by a crown and surrounded by ten gold maple leaves, symbolizing the ten provinces of Canada. Within Alberta, the lieutenant governor also follows only the sovereign in the province's order of precedence, preceding even other members of the Canadian Royal Family and the Queen's federal representative. History Alberta's first Lieutenant Governor, George H. V. Bulyea (left), at Alberta's Government House with the Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal (centre) and Alexander Cameron Rutherford (right), 7 September 1909 Standard of the Lieutenant Governor of Alberta from circa 1965 to 1981 The office of lieutenant governor of Alberta came into being in 1905https://www.alberta.ca/government-house-history.aspx, upon Alberta's entry into Canadian Confederation, and evolved from the earlier position of lieutenant governor of the Northwest Territories. Since that date, 19 lieutenant governors have served the province, amongst whom were notable firsts, such as Norman Kwong‚Äîthe first Asian-Canadian lieutenant governor of Alberta‚Äîand Helen Hunley‚Äîthe first female lieutenant governor of the province. The shortest mandate by a lieutenant governor of Alberta was Philip Primrose, from 1 October 1936 to his death on 17 March 1937, while the longest was John C. Bowen, from 23 March 1937 to 1 February 1950. In 1956, following his appointment, Lieutenant Governor John J. Bowlen became the first provincial viceroy in Canada to be granted an audience with the Canadian monarch, starting a tradition that continues today for all of Canada's lieutenant governors. One of the few examples in Canada of a viceroy exercising the royal prerogative against or without ministerial advice came in 1937, when John Bowen denied royal assent to three bills passed through the Legislative Assembly; two of the bills would have put the province's banks under the control of the provincial government, while a third, the Accurate News and Information Act, would have forced newspapers to print Cabinet rebuttals to stories the ministers objected to. All three bills were later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, though, in retaliation for this move by Bowen, his premier, William Aberhart, closed the viceregal residence, removed the lieutenant governor's secretary and support offices, and took away his official car. Nearly seven decades later, Lois Hole, who served as lieutenant governor from 2000 until her death in 2005, publicly stated that she wished to discuss with her premier, Ralph Klein, the proposed Bill 11, which was meant to allow private health care to compete with the public health care system. From this it was suspected that Hole might reserve royal assent to the bill; however, Hole eventually did allow the bill to pass.

The book was the work of Sir Ronald Syme (1903‚Äì1989), a noted Tacitean scholar, and was published by the Oxford University Press. It was immediately controversial. Its main conclusion was that the structure of the Republic and its Senate were inadequate to the needs of Roman rule, and that Augustus was merely doing what was necessary to restore order in public life. This was a situation and reasoning uncomfortably reminiscent of contemporary events in Nazi Germany and the other fascist regimes of the time. Syme relies on prosopography, especially the work of German scholars Friedrich M√ºnzer and Matthias Gelzer, to show the extent to which Augustus achieved his unofficial but undisputed power by the development of personal relationships into a \\"Caesarian\\" party, then used it to defeat and diminish the opposition one by one. The process was slow, with the young Octavian initially just using his position as a relative of Julius Caesar to pursue Caesar's assassins, then over a period of years gradually accumulating personal power while nominally restoring the Republic. In addition, the portrait he paints of Augustus as a somewhat sinister autocratic figure has been immensely influential among subsequent generations of classicists. Reception Maurice Bowra said in 1939 of Syme's The Roman Revolution: \\"His work is extraordinarily persuasive and interesting... the best book on Roman history that has appeared for many years\\". Syme's conclusion of inevitability is less strongly supported than his elucidation of the takeover process, since at each point we see that Augustus is exercising his free choice, albeit for what he sees as the good of his country. In The Last Generation of the Roman Republic (1974), Erich S. Gruen offered an opposing point of view, arguing that the traditional view of the Republic's decay is not actually supported by the objective evidence. Editions The Roman Revolution has been reprinted regularly by OUP since its first appearance, most recently in 2002 (). (Corrections to the text were made by the author in 1952 and 1956.)

It is one of the oldest forms of poker, and has been played since the start of the 20th Century. It emerged around the time people started using the 52-card deck instead of 20 for poker. The object of Razz is to make the lowest possible five-card hand from the seven cards you are dealt. In Razz, straights and flushes do not count against the player for low, and the ace always plays low. Thus, the best possible Razz hand is 5-4-3-2-A, or 5 high, also known as \\"the wheel\\" or \\"the bicycle\\". Deuce-to-seven Razz is also sometimes played. Razz is featured in the mixed game rotation H.O.R.S.E. as the \\"R\\" in the game's name. Play One variant of the best possible hand in Razz Razz is similar to seven-card stud, except the lowest hand wins. Seven cards are dealt to each player, but only the five best cards (generally the five lowest unpaired cards) are used in forming a complete hand.Pokerstars.com: Razz (7 Card Stud Low) Razz is usually played with a maximum of eight players, with limit betting, meaning that there is a fixed amount that can be bet per player per round. Each player antes and is dealt two cards face down (the hole cards), and one card face up (the \\"door card\\"). The highest door card showing has to \\"bring it in\\" - put in the mandatory first bet, which is usually one third to one half of the regular bet. The player responsible for the bring-in can instead opt to \\"complete the bet\\", i.e. make a whole regular bet. If they opt to make a normal bring-in, the remaining players can either call the bet or \\"complete\\", by raising to a regular bet. From that point the betting continues in regular bet increments. In a case where two people have a door card of the same rank, the bring in is determined by suit. Spades (‚ô†) is the highest possible suit, followed by hearts (‚ô•), diamonds (‚ô¶), and clubs (‚ô£). The is the worst possible door card in Razz, and a guaranteed bring-in. Play continues clockwise from the bring in, as in normal Stud poker. After the first round of betting, each player still in the hand receives another card face up. Betting begins with the lowest hand showing. Play continues like this until the fifth card, at which point the betting increments double. The seventh card is dealt face down, and action would begin with the same player who opened betting on the 6th card. In hand-dealt games, after each hand the deal rotates to the left, as with most forms of poker; although the dealer doesn't play a strategic role as in blind games. =Shortage of cards= It is possible for the dealer to run out of cards before the end of the hand. This can occur when eight players are still in the hand when the seventh cards are to be dealt. Seven cards for eight players would require 56 cards in the deck. Since Razz uses a standard 52 card deck, the hand would be four cards short. To fix this problem, the dealer does not deal a seventh card to any player. Instead, the dealer deals one final card face up in the center of the table, which becomes a community card. All seven players may use this card as the seventh card in their own hands. This is the only time a community card is ever used in Razz.lolPoker.com: Razz poker rules World Series of Poker Razz has been an event at the World Series of Poker since 1971, when Jimmy Casella won the first ever WSOP Razz event for a grand prize of $10,000.Razzpokerrules.org - WSOP Razz Razz is the most popular form of lowball poker but in the overall popularity stakes sits firmly behind Texas hold 'em and Omaha hold 'em. In 2004, the WSOP Razz event was televised by ESPN; the tournament was won by professional poker player and multiple bracelet winner T. J. Cloutier.Poker-Babes.com: How to Play the Game of Razz After the event Razz grew massively in popularity and most of the major online poker rooms added Razz to their spread of games. Full Tilt Poker was the first online site to offer Razz games but soon after the televised tournament, Poker.com, Absolute Poker and finally in 2006 PokerStars added Razz to their selection of games.Playlowballpoker.com: Razz Poker Since 1971, Razz has been featured in every World Series of Poker apart from the 1972 series. London lowball London lowball is a game played almost exclusively in Europe. It is almost identical to Razz in play with the following exceptions: straights and flushes count against a player for low, so the best possible hand is 6-4-3-2-A,PlanetPoker.com: Poker Dictionary and its canonical version is played at pot limit. Some variations of the game are played at no limit, but the name \\"London lowball\\" is typically reserved for the pot-limit version.Gambling-Poker.com: Razz Poker - London Lowball Poker Strategy Normally the best starting hand in Razz is A-2-3. A general strategy in a full-ring game is to only play unpaired cards none of them higher than 8s.Poker-Strategy.org: Razz poker Players want to avoid making pairs and should evaluate other door cards in relation to the strength of their hand. For instance, Jane holds 3-4-5 and sees four \\"dead\\" door cards of 3-4-4-5 behind her. This is a strong hand, as the likelihood of pairing her hole cards is now greatly diminished. Observing the door cards of other players is also very important. A player's hand is much stronger if there are cards of the same denomination already showing (less chance of pairing up on a draw) and weaker if there are make cards visible (i.e. a A-6-7 is a much stronger hand when other players are showing Aces, 6s and 7s than when these players are showing 2s, 3s, 4s and 5s). Another key strategy in Razz is stealing the antes and bring-in bets. If a player is to the right of the bring-in bettor, and everyone else folds, a raise with a lower exposed card is normally the correct play. For example, if Mary has a 9 showing, and John, the bring-in bettor, has a K showing, Mary should normally raise if everyone else folds.

Stockpile stewardship refers to the United States program of reliability testing and maintenance of its nuclear weapons without the use of nuclear testing. Because no new nuclear weapons have been developed by the United States since 1992,Council on Foreign Relations: Global Governance Monitor on Nonproliferation, available at http://www.cfr.org/publication/18985/ even its youngest weapons are at least years old (as of ). Aging weapons can fail or act unpredictably in a number of ways: the high explosives that condense their fissile material can chemically degrade, their electronic components can suffer from decay, their radioactive plutonium/uranium cores are potentially unreliable, and the isotopes used by thermonuclear weapons may be chemically unstable as well. Since the United States has also not tested nuclear weapons since 1992, this leaves the task of its stockpile maintenance resting on the use of simulations (using non-nuclear explosives tests and supercomputers, among other methods) and applications of scientific knowledge about physics and chemistry to the specific problems of weapons aging (the latter method is what is meant when various agencies refer to their work as \\"science-based\\"). It also involves the manufacture of additional plutonium \\"pits\\" to replace ones of unknown quality, and finding other methods to increase the lifespan of existing warheads and maintain a confident nuclear deterrent. Most work for stockpile stewardship is undertaken at United States Department of Energy national laboratories, mostly at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Nevada Test Site, and Department of Energy productions facilities, which employ around 27,500 personnel and cost billions of dollars per year to operate. Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program The Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program is a United States Department of Energy program to ensure that the nuclear capabilities of the United States are not eroded as nuclear weapons age. It costs more than $4 billion annually to test nuclear weapons and build advanced science facilities, such as the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Such facilities have been deemed necessary under the program since President Bill Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1997, The US Senate never ratified the CTBT. President Obama initiated a broad effort to modernize U.S. nuclear forces, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates will require approximately $494 billion to complete. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/54914 =Facilities= The stockpile stewardship program is supported by the following experimental facilities:National Nuclear Security Administration, November 2011 Quarterly SSP Experiment Summary * Dual-Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test Facility, Los Alamos National Laboratory * Contained Firing Facility, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory * National Ignition Facility, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory * Z machine, Sandia National Laboratories * Omega, Laboratory for Laser Energetics * High Explosive Application Facility, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory * Joint Actinide Shock Physics Experimental Research, Nevada National Security Site * Large Bore Powder Gun, Nevada National Security Site * Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, Los Alamos National Laboratory * Proton Radiography, Los Alamos National Laboratory * Big Explosives Experimental Facility, Nevada National Security Site * TA-55, Los Alamos National Laboratory * U1a Facility, Nevada National Security Site The data produced by the experiments carried out in these facilities is used in combination with the Advanced Simulation and Computing Program.

On April 25, 1185, the fleet of the Minamoto clan (Genji), led by Minamoto no Yoshitsune, defeated the fleet of the Taira clan (Heike). The morning rip tide was an advantage to the Taira in the morning but turned to their disadvantage in the afternoon. The young Emperor Antoku was one of those who perished amongst the Taira nobles.  History  Map of the battle of Dan-no-ura The Taira were outnumbered, but some sources say that they had the advantage over the Minamoto in understanding the tides of that particular area, as well as naval combat tactics in general. The Taira split their fleet into three squadrons, while their enemy arrived en masse, their ships abreast, and archers ready. The beginning of the battle consisted mainly of a long-range archery exchange, before the Taira took the initiative, using the tides to help them try to surround the enemy ships. They engaged the Minamoto, and the archery from a distance eventually gave way to hand-to-hand combat with swords and daggers after the crews of the ships boarded each other. However, the tide changed, and the advantage was given back to the Minamoto. One of the crucial factors that allowed the Minamoto to win the battle was that a Taira general, Taguchi Shigeyoshi, defected and attacked the Taira from the rear. He also revealed to the Minamoto which ship the six-year-old Emperor Antoku was on. Their archers turned their attention to the helmsmen and rowers of the Emperor's ship, as well as the rest of their enemy's fleet, sending their ships out of control. Many of the Taira saw the battle turn against them and committed suicide. Among those who perished this way were Antoku and his grandmother, Nun of the Second Rank, Taira no Tokiko the widow of Taira no Kiyomori. To this day, the heike crabs found in the Straits of Shimonoseki are considered by the Japanese to hold the spirits of the Taira warriors. The Taira attempted to toss the imperial regalia off the ship but only managed to get the sword and jewel into the water before the ship holding the regalia was captured. The jewel was recovered by divers; many presume the sword to have been lost at this time, though it is officially said to have been recovered and enshrined at Atsuta Shrine. This decisive defeat of the Taira forces led to the end of the Taira bid for control of Japan. Minamoto no Yoritomo, the elder half-brother of Minamoto Yoshitsune, became the first sh≈çgun, establishing his military government (bakufu) in Kamakura. In this battle the Taira lost Taira Tomomori, Taira Noritsune, Taira Norimori, Taira Tsunemori, Taira Sukemori, Taira Arimori and Taira Yukimori, who were killed.  In culture  The battle is the subject of an opera by the Thai-American composer S. P. Somtow. Called Dan no Ura, the opera premiered in Bangkok in 2014.

His vote against convicting President Andrew Johnson of \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" allowed Johnson to stay in office by the margin of one vote. As the seventh of seven Republican U.S. Senators to break with his party, he proved to be the person whose decision would result in conviction or acquittal. When he chose the latter, the vote of 35‚Äì19 in favor of Johnson's conviction failed to reach the required two-thirds vote. Ross lost his bid for re-election two years later. Early life Ross was born in Ashland, Ohio, on December 7, 1826, the third of fourteen children born to Sylvester Ross Sr. and Cynthia (Rice) Ross. He was educated locally and at age 11 was apprenticed as a printer at the Huron, Ohio, Commercial Advertiser. In 1841 he moved to Sandusky, Ohio, to join the staff of the Sandusky Mirror, which was owned by his brother Sylvester. For several years in the late 1840s and early 1850s, Ross was employed as a journeyman printer and typesetter, traveling throughout Ohio and to several nearby states to accept temporary work whenever it was available. A Democrat who opposed slavery, in 1852, he moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he worked on first the Milwaukee Free Democrat and then the Milwaukee Daily Sentinel. In 1854, Ross was one of several Milwaukee residents who came to the aid of Joshua Glover, an escaped slave who had been recaptured and was being held at the local jail. The group stormed the jail, freed Glover, and enabled his escape to Canada. At the founding of the Republican Party, Ross' anti-slavery leanings caused him to join the new organization. Start of career An opponent of slavery, during the 1850s dispute over whether to admit Kansas to the union as a free state or a slave state, Ross moved to Topeka, Kansas, as did several of his family members, who were also opponents of slavery. The dispute sometimes resulted in violence, and Ross joined the antislavery side's militia. He became a leader of the free state movement as publisher of the Topeka Tribune from 1856 to 1858 and founder of the Kansas State Record in 1859. He joined the board of directors of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway and was one of its chief promoters. In 1859, Ross was elected a delegate to the Kansas constitutional convention of 1859 to 1861. Military service A supporter of the Union during the Civil War, Ross joined the Union Army as a private in 1862. He was commissioned as a captain in command of Company E, 11th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry Regiment. The regiment took part in several battles in the southwestern and western United States, including Second Battle of Lexington, Battle of Little Blue River, Second Battle of Independence, Battle of Byram's Ford, Battle of Westport, Battle of Mine Creek, and Battle of Platte Bridge Station/Battle of Red Buttes. He was promoted to major during the war and was mustered out after the surrender of the Confederacy in 1865. United States Senator After the war, Ross returned to Kansas to continue his newspaper career and was editor of the Kansas Tribune from 1865 to 1866. In 1866, the governor of Kansas appointed Ross to the U.S. Senate as a Republican, filling the vacancy caused by the death of James H. Lane. The state legislature subsequently elected him to complete Lane's term, and he served from July 19, 1866, to March 3, 1871. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the term which began on March 4, 1871. During his Senate service, Ross served as chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills (Fortieth Congress) and the Committee on Engrossed Bills (Forty-first Congress). =Andrew Johnson impeachment= Ross is best known for casting the decisive vote which acquitted Andrew Johnson during his 1868 Presidential Impeachment trial. Some people have claimed that Ross voted against the conviction due to concerns about his colleague Samuel C. Pomeroy receiving patronage from Benjamin Wade, and as a means to receive patronage favors from Johnson. Others claim Ross cast his vote because he genuinely believed that Johnson had the right to replace Edwin M. Stanton, since he had been appointed during the Lincoln Administration. Still others give voice to the opinion that, though the Kansas Senator did believe Johnson guilty of breaking the Tenure of Office Act, he did not believe that offense worthy of impeachment. Kansas newspapers thought clearly that Ross voted against his radical leanings in supporting Johnson because of the influence of his old Civil War colonel, Thomas Ewing Jr., an ardent Johnson supporter at the time.Ronald D. Smith, \\"Thomas Ewing Jr., Frontier Lawyer and Civil War General,\\" Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2008, . See the discussion at pp. 292‚Äì299. Later in life, Ewing wrote Ross that he felt Ross was ‚Äúpreeminent for courage‚Äù among men‚Äînot only for his physical courage in battle but also for opposing Johnson‚Äôs impeachment. ‚ÄúIn making [that] decision, you knew perfectly well that it could consign you to private life and the vehement denunciation of almost all your party friends.‚ÄùThomas Ewing Jr. to Ross, July 16, 1894, Thomas Ewing Jr. Papers, Kansas State Historical Society. However, there is significant evidence that suggests Ross was bribed, although a subsequent House of Representatives investigation found no proof. Edmund G. Ross is one of eight U.S. Senators featured in Profiles in Courage, the 1956 Pulitzer Prize-winning history co- written by then-Senator John F. Kennedy and Theodore Sorensen in commemoration of past acts of political courage in Congress. Later career Upon retirement from the Senate, Ross went back into the newspaper business briefly, launching a publication in Coffeyville, Kansas.Ross, Edmund G. ‚Äì KS- Cyclopedia ‚Äì 1912 He left the Republican Party after 1872 and was affiliated with the Democrats. In 1880, he ran unsuccessfully for governor of Kansas. A trip to New Mexico in 1882 had a positive effect on his health and he moved there permanently. He studied law and passed the bar, afterwards practicing in Albuquerque and beginning work on a history of the Johnson impeachment. From 1885 to 1889, Ross served as governor of New Mexico Territory, appointed by President Grover Cleveland. He served as secretary of the New Mexico Bureau of Immigration from 1894 to 1896. In 1896, he published his book History of the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson. Time caused Kansans to look on Ross more favorably with respect to his role in the Johnson impeachment. In 1907, General Hugh Cameron of Lawrence visited Ross in New Mexico and brought testimonials from many citizens of Kansas. Death Ross died in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on May 8, 1907. He was interred at Fairview Memorial Park Cemetery in Albuquerque. Family In 1848, Ross married Fannie Lathrop (1827-1899) in Sandusky, Ohio. Their children included Lillian, Arthur, Pitt, Flynt, Edmundie, Kay and Fannie. Footnotes Further reading * Bumgardner, Edward, 1949. The Life of Edmund G. Ross.

The red dots are the wave nodes A node is a point along a standing wave where the wave has minimum amplitude. For the instance, in a vibrating guitar string, the ends of the string are nodes. By changing the position of the end node through frets, the guitarist changes the effective length of the vibrating string and thereby the note played. The opposite of a node is an anti-node, a point where the amplitude of the standing wave is at maximum. These occur midway between the nodes.  Explanation  Pattern of two waves' interference (from up to down). The point represents the node. Standing waves result when two sinusoidal wave trains of the same frequency are moving in opposite directions in the same space and interfere with each other. They occur when waves are reflected at a boundary, such as sound waves reflected from a wall or electromagnetic waves reflected from the end of a transmission line, and particularly when waves are confined in a resonator at resonance, bouncing back and forth between two boundaries, such as in an organ pipe or guitar string. In a standing wave the nodes are a series of locations at equally spaced intervals where the wave amplitude (motion) is zero (see animation above). At these points the two waves add with opposite phase and cancel each other out. They occur at intervals of half a wavelength (Œª/2). Midway between each pair of nodes are locations where the amplitude is maximum. These are called the antinodes. At these points the two waves add with the same phase and reinforce each other. In cases where the two opposite wave trains are not the same amplitude, they do not cancel perfectly, so the amplitude of the standing wave at the nodes is not zero but merely a minimum. This occurs when the reflection at the boundary is imperfect. This is indicated by a finite standing wave ratio (SWR), the ratio of the amplitude of the wave at the antinode to the amplitude at the node. In resonance of a two dimensional surface or membrane, such as a drumhead or vibrating metal plate, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface where the surface is motionless, dividing the surface into separate regions vibrating with opposite phase. These can be made visible by sprinkling sand on the surface, and the intricate patterns of lines resulting are called Chladni figures. In transmission lines a voltage node is a current antinode, and a voltage antinode is a current node. Nodes are the points of zero displacement, not the points where two constituent waves intersect.  Boundary conditions  Where the nodes occur in relation to the boundary reflecting the waves depends on the end conditions or boundary conditions. Although there are many types of end conditions, the ends of resonators are usually one of two types that cause total reflection: * _Fixed boundary_ : Examples of this type of boundary are the attachment point of a guitar string, the closed end of an open pipe like an organ pipe or a woodwind pipe, the periphery of a drumhead, a transmission line with the end short circuited, or the mirrors at the ends of a laser cavity. In this type, the amplitude of the wave is forced to zero at the boundary, so there is a node at the boundary, and the other nodes occur at multiples of half a wavelength from it: :: 0, Œª/2, Œª, 3Œª/2, 2Œª, ... * _Free boundary_ : Examples of this type are an open-ended organ or woodwind pipe, the ends of the vibrating resonator bars in a xylophone, glockenspiel or tuning fork, the ends of an antenna, or a transmission line with an open end. In this type the derivative (slope) of the wave's amplitude (in sound waves the pressure, in electromagnetic waves the current) is forced to zero at the boundary. So there is an amplitude maximum (antinode) at the boundary, the first node occurs a quarter wavelength from the end, and the other nodes are at half wavelength intervals from there: :: Œª/4, 3Œª/4, 5Œª/4, 7Œª/4, ...  Examples  = Sound = A sound wave consists of alternating cycles of compression and expansion of the wave medium. During compression, the molecules of the medium are forced together, resulting in the increased pressure and density. During expansion the molecules are forced apart, resulting in the decreased pressure and density. The number of nodes in a specified length is directly proportional to the frequency of the wave. Occasionally on a guitar, violin, or other stringed instrument, nodes are used to create harmonics. When the finger is placed on top of the string at a certain point, but does not push the string all the way down to the fretboard, a third node is created (in addition to the bridge and nut) and a harmonic is sounded. During normal play when the frets are used, the harmonics are always present, although they are quieter. With the artificial node method, the overtone is louder and the fundamental tone is quieter. If the finger is placed at the midpoint of the string, the first overtone is heard, which is an octave above the fundamental note which would be played, had the harmonic not been sounded. When two additional nodes divide the string into thirds, this creates an octave and a perfect fifth (twelfth). When three additional nodes divide the string into quarters, this creates a double octave. When four additional nodes divide the string into fifths, this creates a double-octave and a major third (17th). The octave, major third and perfect fifth are the three notes present in a major chord. The characteristic sound that allows the listener to identify a particular instrument is largely due to the relative magnitude of the harmonics created by the instrument. = Chemistry = In chemistry, quantum mechanical waves, or \\"orbitals\\", are used to describe the wave-like properties of electrons. Many of these quantum waves have nodes and antinodes as well. The number and position of these nodes and antinodes give rise to many of the properties of an atom or covalent bond. Atomic orbitals are classified according to the number of radial and angular nodes, while molecular orbitals are classified according to bonding character. Molecular orbitals with an antinode between nuclei are very stable, and are known as \\"bonding orbitals\\" which strengthen the bond. In contrast, molecular orbitals with a node between nuclei will not be stable due to electrostatic repulsion and are known as \\"anti-bonding orbitals\\" which weaken the bond. Another such quantum mechanical concept is the particle in a box where the number of nodes of the wavefunction can help determine the quantum energy state--zero nodes corresponds to the ground state, one node corresponds to the 1st excited state, etc. In general,Albert Messiah, 1966.

Historically a theater district, it is now a popular nightlife and entertainment area characterized by its eccentric atmosphere and large illuminated signboards. One of the area's most prominent features, a billboard for confectionery company Glico displaying the image of a runner crossing a finishing line, is seen as an icon of Osaka within Japan. History Dotonbori in 1910 D≈çtonbori in the 1930s D≈çtonbori traces its history back to 1612, when a local entrepreneur, Yasui D≈çton, began expanding the tiny Umezu River, which ran east to west, hoping to increase commerce in the region by connecting the two branches of the Yokobori River, which ran north to south, with a canal. D≈çton's project was interrupted when he died defending Toyotomi Hideyori in the ill-fated Siege of Osaka, but his cousins finished the canal in 1615. The new lord of Osaka Castle, Tadaki Matsudaira, named the canal and avenue beside it D≈çtonbori (\\"bori\\" from \\"hori\\", meaning \\"canal\\"), even though Doton had been on the losing side during the siege. The character of D≈çtonbori became defined in 1621 when the Tokugawa Shogunate instituted urban planning, designating D≈çtonbori as the entertainment district of Osaka. By 1662 the avenue boasted six Kabuki theatres and five Bunraku theatres, as well as the unique Takeda Karakuri mechanical puppet theatre. Many restaurants and cafes were built to cater to the flood of tourists and entertainment-seekers pouring nightly into D≈çtonbori. Over the years, declining interest in traditional forms of entertainment led to the closing of most of D≈çtonbori's original attractions. Its five remaining theatres were bombed and destroyed during World War II.  Restaurants  Visitors enjoy illuminated billboards, video screens and mechanized signs along the boardwalk Osaka is a major destination for tourists, both domestic and international. The Dotonbori district is a popular area for visitors to the city and boasts a number of well known restaurants offering a range of traditional and modern Japanese dishes. =Kuidaore= is a Japanese word meaning roughly ‚Äúto ruin oneself by extravagance in food.‚Äù It is sometimes romanised as cuidaore, and is part of a larger proverb: \\"Dress into ruin in Kyoto, eat into ruin in Osaka\\" (‰∫¨ÈÉΩ„ÅÆÁùÄÂÄí„Çå„ÄÅÂ§ßÈò™„ÅÆÈ£ü„ÅÑÂÄí„Çå). The word is associated with D≈çtonbori, and is often used in tourist guides and advertisements. It can be seen in the names of several locations in D≈çtonbori, such as the mascot Kuidaore Taro and the defunct restaurant Cui-daore. Some foods associated specifically with Osaka and kuidaore include okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and kitsune udon.Takao Sugiura \\"Kuidaore: To eat oneself bankrupt A study of Osaka epicurism\\", Tsuji Group =Restaurants of note= *Kinryu Ramen: There are three Kinryu (Golden Dragon) Ramen restaurants in D≈çtonbori, one at each end of the street and one in the middle. The chain is notable for its giant three-dimensional golden dragon billboards, as well as its outdoor seating consisting of tatami mats. Unlike many Japanese restaurants, Kinryu Ramen is open 24 hours, and offers a free garlic and kimchi bar. *Kani Doraku: A crab restaurant, famous for its moving crab billboard. *Otakoya: A popular takoyaki stand. *Zubora-ya: A fugu restaurant with a huge blowfish lantern hanging out front. *D≈çtonbori Ramen Taishokudo: A ramen restaurant formed by eight famous ramen shops from across Japan. *Hariju: A beef restaurant established in 1924.

The sign has been altered on several occasions to celebrate events such as the World Cup and to show support for the Osaka baseball team, the Hanshin Tigers. The current version is the sixth, which uses LEDs. The previous five incarnations of the sign used neon lights.

More practically, the bridge provides a link between the Shinsaibashi-suji and Ebisubashi-suji shopping districts. Due to the familiarity of the Glico Man, Ebisubashi makes for a convenient gathering point, hence its nicknames, nanpa-bashi, mostly used by foreigners, and hikkake-bashi (\\"the pulling bridge\\"), mostly used by native Japanese.

He was born in Egypt between 950 and 952 and came from a respected family in Fustat. His father was a historian, biographer, and scholar of hadith, who wrote two volumes about the history of Egypt‚Äîone about the Egyptians and one based on traveller commentary on Egypt.Eternal Egypt.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. p. 58 His great-grandfather had been an associate of the noted legal scholar Imam Shafi. Early in the life of Ibn Yunus, the Fatimid dynasty came to power and the new city of Cairo was founded. In Cairo, he worked as an astronomer for the Fatimid dynasty for twenty-six years, first for the Caliph al-Aziz and then for al-Hakim. Ibn Yunus dedicated his most famous astronomical work, al-Zij al-Kabir al-Hakimi, to the latter. As well as for his mathematics, Ibn Yunus was also known as an eccentric and a poet.. Works =Astrology= In astrology, noted for making predictions and having written the Kitab bulugh al-umniyya (\\"On the Attainment of Desire\\"), a work concerning the heliacal risings of Sirius, and on predictions concerning what day of the week the Coptic year will start on. =Astronomy= Ibn Yunus' most famous work in Islamic astronomy, al-Zij al- Kabir al-Hakimi (c. 1000), was a handbook of astronomical tables which contained very accurate observations, many of which may have been obtained with very large astronomical instruments. According to N. M. Swerdlow, the Zij al-Kabir al-Hakimi is \\"a work of outstanding originality of which just over half survives\\".N. M. Swerdlow (1993), \\"Montucla's Legacy: The History of the Exact Sciences\\", Journal of the History of Ideas 54 (2): 299‚Äì328 [320].

Now recognized as one of Werner's formulas, it was essential for the development of prosthaphaeresis and logarithms decades later. Ibn Yunus described 40 planetary conjunctions and 30 lunar eclipses. For example, he accurately describes the planetary conjunction that occurred in the year 1000 as follows: :A conjunction of Venus and Mercury in Gemini, observed in the western sky: The two planets were in conjunction after sunset on the night [of Sunday 19 May 1000]. The time was approximately eight equinoctial hours after midday on Sunday ... . Mercury was north of Venus and their latitude difference was a third of a degree. Modern knowledge of the positions of the planets confirms that his description and his calculation of the distance being one-third of a degree is exactly correct. Ibn Yunus's observations on conjunctions and eclipses were used in Richard Dunthorne and Simon Newcombs' respective calculations of the secular acceleration of the moon.Raymond Mercer (1994), 'English Orientalists and Mathematical Astronomy' in The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in 17th-Century England, p.198 =Pendulum= Recent encyclopaedias and popular accounts claim that the tenth century astronomer Ibn Yunus used a pendulum for time measurement, despite the fact that it has been known for nearly a hundred years that this is based on nothing more than an error made in 1684 by the Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford Edward Bernard.

If two products are said to be bioequivalent it means that they would be expected to be, for all intents and purposes, the same. Birkett (2003) defined bioequivalence by stating that, \\"two pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent and their bioavailabilities (rate and extent of availability) after administration in the same molar dose are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, can be expected to be essentially the same. Pharmaceutical equivalence implies the same amount of the same active substance(s), in the same dosage form, for the same route of administration and meeting the same or comparable standards.\\" For The World Health Organization (WHO) \\"two pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives, and their bioavailabilities, in terms of rate (Cmax and tmax) and extent of absorption (area under the curve), after administration of the same molar dose under the same conditions, are similar to such a degree that their effects can be expected to be essentially the same\\".WHO Guidance for organizations performing in vivo bioequivalence studies. WHO Technical Report Series No. 996, 2016, Annex 9 The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined bioequivalence as, \\"the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study.\\"  Bioequivalence  In determining bioequivalence, for example, between two products such as a commercially available Brand product and a potential to-be-marketed Generic product, pharmacokinetic studies are conducted whereby each of the preparations are administered in a cross-over study to volunteer subjects, generally healthy individuals but occasionally in patients. Serum/plasma samples are obtained at regular intervals and assayed for parent drug (or occasionally metabolite) concentration. Occasionally, blood concentration levels are neither feasible or possible to compare the two products (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids), then pharmacodynamic endpoints rather than pharmacokinetic endpoints (see below) are used for comparison. For a pharmacokinetic comparison, the plasma concentration data are used to assess key pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), and absorption lag time (tlag). Testing should be conducted at several different doses, especially when the drug displays non-linear pharmacokinetics. In addition to data from bioequivalence studies, other data may need to be submitted to meet regulatory requirements for bioequivalence. Such evidence may include: * analytical method validation * in vitro-in vivo correlation studies (IVIVC)  Regulatory definition  = The World Health Organization = The World Health Organization considers two formulation bioequivalent if the 90% confidence interval for the ratio multisource (generic) product/comparator lie within 80.00-125.00% acceptance range for AUC0‚Äìt and Cmax. For high variable finished pharmaceutical products, the applicable acceptance range for Cmax can be 69.84-143.19%.WHO guidelines on Multisource (generic) pharmaceutical products: guidelines on registration requirements to establish interchangeability WHO Technical Report Series, No. 1003, 2017, Annex 6 = Australia = In Australia, the Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) considers preparations to be bioequivalent if the 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) of the rate ratios, between the two preparations, of Cmax and AUC lie in the range 0.80‚Äì1.25. Tmax should also be similar between the products. There are tighter requirements for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and/or saturable metabolism - thus no generic products exist on the Australian market for digoxin or phenytoin for instance. = Europe = According to regulations applicable in the European Economic Area two medicinal products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or pharmaceutical alternatives and if their bioavailabilities after administration in the same molar dose are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, will be essentially the same. This is considered demonstrated if the 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) of the ratios for AUC0‚Äìt and Cmax between the two preparations lie in the range 80‚Äì125%. = United States = The FDA considers two products bioequivalent if the 90% CI of the relative mean Cmax, AUC(0‚Äìt) and AUC(0‚Äì‚àû) of the test (e.g. generic formulation) to reference (e.g. innovator brand formulation) should be within 80% to 125% in the fasting state. Although there are a few exceptions, generally a bioequivalent comparison of Test to Reference formulations also requires administration after an appropriate meal at a specified time before taking the drug, a so-called \\"fed\\" or \\"food-effect\\" study. A food-effect study requires the same statistical evaluation as the fasting study, described above.  Bioequivalence issues  While the FDA maintains that approved generic drugs are equivalent to their branded counterparts, bioequivalence problems have been reported by physicians and patients for many drugs. Certain classes of drugs are suspected to be particularly problematic because of their chemistry. Some of these include chiral drugs, poorly absorbed drugs, and cytotoxic drugs. In addition, complex delivery mechanisms can cause bioequivalence variances. Physicians are cautioned to avoid switching patients from branded to generic, or between different generic manufacturers, when prescribing anti-epileptic drugs, warfarin, and levothyroxine.http://www.cell.com/trends/pharmacological- sciences/fulltext/S0165-6147(15)00241-2 Major issues were raised in the verification of bioequivalence when multiple generic versions of FDA-approved generic drug were found not to be equivalent in efficacy and side effect profiles.http://www.raps.org/focus-online/news/news-article-view/article/3794/ In 2007, two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements, ConsumerLab.com and The People's Pharmacy, released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion. The People's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion, which prompted it to ask ConsumerLab.com to test the products in question. The tests showed that some generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg didn't perform the same as the brand-name pill in laboratory tests. The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that the generic version is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion. The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL. After several years of denying patient reports, in 2012 the FDA reversed this opinion, announcing that \\"Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.\\" The FDA did not test the bioequivalence of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013. As of October 2013, the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being bioequivalent. In 2004, Ranbaxy was revealed to have been falsifying data regarding the generic drugs they were manufacturing. As a result, 30 products were removed from US markets and Ranbaxy paid $500 million in fines. The FDA investigated many Indian drug manufacturers after this was discovered, and as a result at least 12 companies have been banned from shipping drugs to the US.

Produced by Hal Roach and released to theaters by Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, it was the 146th entry in the Our Gang series to be released. Plot It is the first day of school and the kids wait on the school steps with long faces and pouted lips. Worried about the new teacher they'll be getting this term, Spanky and Alfalfa come up with a scheme to get themselves excused from school: Spanky has Alfalfa pretend he has a toothache, going as far as to stuff a balloon in his mouth to sell the idea. Unknown to the kids, however, the new school teacher, Miss Lawrence, has overheard Spanky and Alfalfa's scheming and has ordered ice cream as a first-day surprise for the class. She sees right through Alfalfa's fibs about being too sick to sing \\"Good Morning to You\\" with the rest of the class, and knowingly grants him an excuse to go home (and Spanky an excuse to take him home). The two boys' triumph backfires when they see the ice cream man as he makes his delivery to the rest of their class. Now needing to find a way to get back into school, Spanky pops the balloon in Alfalfa's mouth, and explains to Miss Lawrence, \\"Funny thing, teacher; he's all well now\\". Miss Lawrence agrees to let the boys back in for the ice cream party, but only if Alfalfa will make up for not singing \\"Good Morning\\" by rendering another song. However, Alfalfa has accidentally swallowed the stopper from the balloon that constituted his \\"toothache\\", so as he steps in front of the class to sing '\\"Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms'\\", a strange wheeze accompanies every breath he takes between lines. At the conclusion of his song, Spanky and Alfalfa go to get their ice cream only to find that it has melted, but the kind and clever Miss Lawrence hands the boys two fresh ice cream bars. Notes A remake of Teacher's Pet, Bored of Education was also the first Our Gang entry in the series' revamped one-reel (ten-minute) format, after 14 years of two-reel and three-reel entries. Bored of Education won Hal Roach his only Academy Award for Our Gang, the 1937 Academy Award for Short Subjects (One-Reel). Bored of Education was also the first Our Gang film directed by Gordon Douglas. Douglas, who had served as assistant director on Our Gang for some time, made his directorial debut on a 1935 Hal Roach All Stars short, The Infernal Triangle. Douglas would remain Our Gang's senior director through 1938. With the series now in one-reel format, Douglas had to modify the looser approaches of his predecessors, Robert F. McGowan and Gus Meins, and turned the Our Gang series into slicker, more streamlined shorts based around situation comedy.

By 1936, producer Hal Roach, who had built his studio around popular two-reel comedies, had slowly begun phasing out his short subjects production as movie theaters opted for double feature programs instead of the traditional program of selected short subjects and one feature. Roach had successfully moved his biggest stars, Laurel and Hardy, to full-time feature production in 1935. Rather than cancel Our Gang, however, Roach continued the series at the behest of his distributor, Louis B. Mayer of MGM.Maltin, Leonard & Bann, Richard W (1977, rev. 1992). The Little Rascals: The Life & Times of Our Gang. New York: Crown Publishing/Three Rivers Press. p. 169-171. .

Lawrence appeared in five more Our Gang shorts during the 1936-37 cycle of shorts. Bored of Education won Roach the Academy Award for Short Subjects (One-Reel), the only Our Gang film so honored. In their review for the short in their book The Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang, film historians Leonard Maltin and Richard W. Bann felt that the award seemed to be \\"a product of whim or timing, rather than strictly a consideration of merit\\", noting earlier and later shorts‚ÄìTeacher's Pet among them‚Äìthey felt were overlooked. Bored of Education was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with the UCLA Film and Television Archive, in 2013.

He batted and threw right-handed. Nelson retired on January 12, 2007, the same day he signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees. In his MLB career Nelson pitched in 798 games with a 48-45 record, and with runners in scoring position and two out he held batters to a .191 batting average. In 55 post-season games (second all-time behind former teammate Mariano Rivera), he compiled a 2-3 mark with 62 strikeouts and a 2.65 ERA in 54.1 innings. Among hitters whom he dominated most were Troy Glaus, who in 14 at-bats was hitless with 11 strikeouts. Nelson had three stints with the Seattle Mariners (1992‚Äì1995, 2001‚Äì2003 and again in 2005). He is Seattle's all-time record holder for most games pitched (383), and has a 23-20 record with the Mariners. Nelson is currently a television color analyst for the Miami Marlins and New York Yankees. Major League career Nelson grew up in Maryland and played baseball and basketball at Catonsville High School. Drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 22nd round of the 1984 MLB draft, he signed on June 21, 1984. In 1986, he was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the minor league phase of the Rule 5 draft. Nelson made his Major League debut with the Mariners on April 16, 1992 against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park. He pitched two scoreless innings of relief. On July 13, 1995, Nelson entered a game against the Toronto Blue Jays with two runners on base and no outs. Nelson threw one pitch to Sandy Mart√≠nez and induced a ground ball triple play. He became the first pitcher in the era for which pitch count data is available to throw only one pitch in an outing and be credited with pitching a full inning. Before the season, Nelson was sent to the New York Yankees, and returned to Seattle as a free agent in . In that season he made the American League All-Star team. Nelson's All-Star selection was considered an innovative move by AL manager Joe Torre, as Nelson's role of middle relief was traditionally overlooked during All-Star selection. From 2001-2003, he formed the right side of Seattle's potent lefty/righty setup squad along with left-handed pitcher Arthur Rhodes. In 2001, he held opposing batters to a .136 batting average and a .199 slugging percentage, and .074/.110 once he had two strikes on them. Nelson was traded to the Yankees during the midseason. The Yankees lost to the Florida Marlins in the World Series and once again Nelson left the Yankees. In , Nelson appeared in 29 games for the Texas Rangers, going 1-2 with a 5.32 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice with an assortment of injuries to his right knee and right elbow. Before the season, the Seattle Mariners signed Nelson to a minor league contract, his third stint with the club. In the offseason, Nelson signed a minor-league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals, but was released before the season began. He was then picked up by the White Sox. =Surgery= On June 8, 2006, Nelson announced that he would undergo surgery, to relieve a nerve in his right elbow, that was likely to mark the end of Nelson's active baseball career. Following the operation on his pitching elbow, on May 10, 2007, there was controversy when he tried to sell bone chips from his elbow, removed in the operation, on eBay who cancelled the auction. Nelson, whose daughters attended The Bear Creek School, were going to give half the proceeds to the School and half to the Curtis Williams Foundation.\\"Body parts not allowed to be listed on eBay\\", Darren Rovell, ESPN, 15 May 2007 Pitching Nelson was a respected slider specialist, much more effective against right-handed batters than against lefties (who batted 55 points higher, and slugged 106 points higher, against him than did righties). He was also known for his three-quarters sidearm delivery, and threw a cut 90-MPH fastball as well. During his Yankees tenure, he was known for faking a throw to third and then faking a throw to first in the same motion, so as to avoid balking. This was and still is referred to as \\"the old Jeff Nelson\\" by Yankees play-by-play broadcaster Michael Kay. Broadcasting Nelson has filled in on sports radio KJR-AM in Seattle and also worked as an analyst for MLB.com during the 2010 post-season. In 2016, Nelson joined Fox Sports' pre-game broadcast team for Miami Marlins. In 2019, Nelson served as a game analyst for the YES Network, calling occasional games for his former team. On July 12, 2019, Nelson began appearing on the YES Network's pregame show. Personal life In 2003, Nelson was the junior varsity basketball coach at The Bear Creek School in Redmond, Washington. Nelson met his first wife, Colette, when they were teenagers in Baltimore. They went on their first date at a Pizza Hut on December 1, 1984. At the time of his retirement in 2007, Nelson was living in Carnation, Washington with his wife and four daughters, Chandler, Gabrielle, Emily and Alexandra. Nelson later married Sheri Quinn Nelson in Jupiter, Florida where they shared a home.

The definition of a node depends on the network and protocol layer referred to. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a communications channel. A passive distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.  Computer networks  In data communication, a physical network node may either be data communication equipment (DCE) such as a modem, hub, bridge or switch; or data terminal equipment (DTE) such as a digital telephone handset, a printer or a host computer. If the network in question is a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN), every LAN or WAN node that participates on the data link layer must have a network address, typically one for each network interface controller it possesses. Examples are computers, a DSL modem with Ethernet interface and wireless access point. Equipment, such as an Ethernet hub or modem with serial interface, that operates only below the data link layer does not require a network address. If the network in question is the Internet or an intranet, many physical network nodes are host computers, also known as Internet nodes, identified by an IP address, and all hosts are physical network nodes. However, some data-link-layer devices such as switches, bridges and wireless access points do not have an IP host address (except sometimes for administrative purposes), and are not considered to be Internet nodes or hosts, but are considered physical network nodes and LAN nodes.  Telecommunications  In the fixed telephone network, a node may be a public or private telephone exchange, a remote concentrator or a computer providing some intelligent network service. In cellular communication, switching points and databases such as the Base station controller, Home Location Register, Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) are examples of nodes. Cellular network base stations are not considered to be nodes in this context. In cable television systems (CATV), this term has assumed a broader context and is generally associated with a fiber optic node. This can be defined as those homes or businesses within a specific geographic area that are served from a common fiber optic receiver. A fiber optic node is generally described in terms of the number of \\"homes passed\\" that are served by that specific fiber node. Distributed systems If the network in question is a distributed system, the nodes are clients, servers or peers. A peer may sometimes serve as client, sometimes server. In a peer-to-peer or overlay network, nodes that actively route data for the other networked devices as well as themselves are called supernodes. Distributed systems may sometimes use virtual nodes so that the system is not oblivious to the heterogeneity of the nodes. This issue is addressed with special algorithms, like consistent hashing, as it is the case in Amazon's Dynamo. Within a vast computer network, the individual computers on the periphery of the network, those that do not also connect other networks, and those that often connect transiently to one or more clouds are called end nodes. Typically, within the cloud computing construct, the individual user or customer computer that connects into one well-managed cloud is called an end node. Since these computers are a part of the network yet unmanaged by the cloud's host, they present significant risks to the entire cloud. This is called the end node problem. There are several means to remedy this problem but all require instilling trust in the end node computer.

He was indicted and impeached during his second term, forced to resign and barred from holding further Texas office. Later, his wife Miriam A. Ferguson, known as \\"Ma\\" Ferguson, was twice elected as governor, and he became the first gentleman of Texas for two nonconsecutive terms.  Early life  Ferguson was born to the Reverend James E. Ferguson, Sr., and Fannie Ferguson near Salado in south Bell County, Texas. At age 12 he entered Salado College (a preparatory school) but was eventually expelled for disobedience. At 16, he left home and drifted through the states of the American West, working successively in a vineyard, a mine, a barbed wire factory, and at a grain ranch. After he returned to Texas, he studied law in Bell County and was admitted to the bar.Brochure, \\"Meet the Fergusons: Two Governors for the Price of One\\", Bell County Museum, Belton, Texas On December 31, 1899, he married Miriam A. Wallace at her family home. In 1903, Ferguson was elected as city attorney in Belton, Texas. In addition, he established Farmers State Bank. In 1906, he sold Farmers bank and established Temple State Bank. He also became active in the Democratic Party and managed several local political campaigns.  First Term as Governor  In 1914, Ferguson was elected as governor of Texas by running as an anti-prohibitionist Democrat. When the Democratic Party dominated the Texas political landscape, winning the Democratic primary often sealed the election results. Ferguson was the only \\"wet\\" candidate in the Democratic primary and garnered all of the anti- prohibitionist votes over a plurality of \\"dry\\" candidates.Gould (1982), p. 260. Prior to his inauguration, Ferguson conferred with officials at the University of Texas regarding appointments affecting learning and higher education.Gould (1982), pp. 261262. According to historian Dan Utley, Ferguson planned to use state appointments as part of a spoils system to reward his political supporters. He tapped Reverend Allan Ferguson Cunningham to serve as State Librarian, despite his lack of training or experience in the field. The incumbent State Librarian was Ernest Winkler, who was a professional historian with years of experience as a librarian. The chair of the State Library and Historical Commission, Eugene C. Barker, heard talk about these plans and intervened in support of Winkler. He convened the commission, and the body approved that Barker write a letter to the Governor-elect. The letter claimed that Winkler was the best person for the job. Meanwhile, Winkler fought for his job by enlisting the help of his colleagues. Other high-profile librarians voiced their support of Winkler, as did the son of an ex-governor, and a chapter of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.Utley (2013), pp. 7576.. On March 24, 1915, Ferguson signed the textbook law in Texas, requiring simplification of laws to accommodate the common man.  Second Term as Governor  After being re-elected in 1916, Ferguson vetoed the appropriations for the University of Texas. The veto was retaliation against the university because of its refusal to dismiss certain faculty members whom Ferguson found objectionable, including William Harding Mayes, former Texas Lieutenant Governor and founder and dean of the University of Texas School of Journalism. He had been an opponent of Ferguson for the Democratic party's nomination for governor in 1914.Texas Legislative Commission The accusations against Mayes were that he used his ownership of newspapers, including the Brownwood Bulletin, to spread negative information about Ferguson. Another leading Ferguson critic on the UT campus was the historian Eugene C. Barker. Ferguson's attack against Mayes resulted in a drive by the legislature to impeach Ferguson. The chairman of the investigating committee, William H. Bledsoe of Lubbock, called for impeachment. Ferguson was indicted on nine charges in July 1917. The Texas House of Representatives prepared 21 charges against Ferguson, and the Senate convicted him on 10 of those charges, including misapplication of public funds and receiving $156,000 from an unnamed source. The Texas Senate, many of whom had served under William Harding Mayes and with whom Mayes maintained cordial relationships,Texas State Senate Journal removed Ferguson as governor and declared him ineligible to hold office under Texas jurisdiction. But Ferguson ran for governor in the 1918 Democratic primary. He was defeated in the Democratic primary by his successor and incumbent, William P. Hobby of Houston, previously the lieutenant governor.  Presidential candidate  Ferguson also ran for President of the United States in the 1920 election as the candidate of the American Party. Ferguson was on the ballot only in Texas, where he received 47,968 votes (9.9 percent of the vote in Texas, 0.2 percent of the vote nationwide). The 1920 presidential election was won by Republican candidate Warren Harding. Democratic nominee James M. Cox won in Texas, where the white majority was voting solidly Democratic. Ferguson was also surpassed by three other unsuccessful candidates: * Eugene Victor Debs of the Socialist Party of America. * Parley Parker Christensen of the United States Farmer-Labor Party. * Aaron Sherman Watkins of the United States Prohibition Party.  Senate bid and First Gentleman of Texas  Monument to the Governors Ferguson at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas Ferguson failed at his bid for the United States Senate in 1922, having lost in the Democratic runoff election to Earle Bradford Mayfield. In 1924, Ferguson entered his wife Miriam, known as \\"Ma\\", in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. She won that and the general election, saying that she intended to rely on her husband for advice. In 1924, unable to run under his own name, he Mr. Ferguson, known as \\"Pa\\", ran his wife's campaign for the governorship against Judge Felix Robertson, the candidate endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. The Fergusons beat Robertson and went to the Governor's Mansion for a third time. Two years later they lost a reelection bid amid new scandals concerning excessive pardons and political patronage abuses. She served two nonconsecutive two-year terms as governor: January 20, 1925 ‚Äì January 17, 1927. She was reelected in 1932 and served January 17, 1933 ‚Äì January 15, 1935. \\"Ma\\" Ferguson became the second female governor in the United States, with Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming being the first. Both women followed husbands who had served earlier. Nellie Tayloe Ross was sworn in on January 5, 1925; Miriam Ferguson followed on January 20. In 1935, the Fergusons lost their ranch in Bell County because of financial troubles during the Great Depression. Nine years later, Ferguson died of a stroke. He is interred next to his wife at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

Enghien-les-Bains is famous as a spa resort and a well-to-do suburb of Paris, developed in the nineteenth century around the scenic lake of Enghien. A casino, the only one in the vicinity of Paris, is located on the shores of the lake. The Hotel des Quatre Pavillons, circa 1825 The thermal baths Name The suffix les Bains (literally \\"the Baths\\") was added to the name when the commune was incorporated in 1850, to distinguish this place from the Belgian city of Enghien, near Mons, and to acknowledge the thermal baths for which Enghien-les-Bains is famous. The name Enghien itself does refer to the Belgian city, which was a fief of the princes of Cond√©, a cadet branch of the French royal family, who inherited the duchy of Montmorency in 1633. In 1689 they were allowed by King Louis XIV to rename the duchy of Montmorency to be the \\"duchy of Enghien\\", in order to revive the title, duc d'Enghien, which they had lost in 1569 at the death of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Cond√©, who had not legally registered the title. The village of Montmorency (now a city) continued to be known as \\"Montmorency\\", despite the official name change, but the name \\"Enghien\\" clung to the nearby lake and marshland that would later become the commune of Enghien-les-Bains. History Before the French Revolution, what is now Enghien-les-Bains was a lake and a marshland under the jurisdiction of Montmorency. In 1766, a priest at the oratory of Montmorency discovered a warm sulphur spring near the lake of Enghien, and the area began to develop as a spa resort. At the creation of the communes in 1790, during the French Revolution, the area of Enghien was withdrawn from the jurisdiction of Montmorency and divided between several communes. In the nineteenth century, the development of Enghien led to its incorporation as a commune. The commune, which was named Enghien-les-Bains, was created on 7 August 1850 by detaching a part of the territory of Deuil-la-Barre and merging it with a part of the territory of Saint-Gratien, a part of the territory of Soisy-sous- Montmorency, and a part of the territory of √âpinay-sur-Seine. Transport Enghien-les-Bains is served by two stations on the Transilien Paris‚ÄìNord suburban rail line: La Barre‚ÄìOrmesson and Enghien-les-Bains. Education Primary schools include: * Les Cygnes * Raoul Riet Casino Known as the biggest place to gamble near Paris, Enghien les Bains casino, which opened in 1901 was recently renovated to provide luxury and comfort to all tourists traveling to the capital of France. The resort has two hotels and offers to the guests the opportunity to dine in one of its many restaurants. You will also find bars and a theater where concerts and shows are organized.

The village overlooks Vendelsj√∂n, a long inland stretch of water near the Vendel river which has its confluence with the river Fyris. Vendel was the site of an ancient royal estate, part of Uppsala √∂d, a network of royal estates meant to provide income for the medieval Swedish kings. A large number of archaeological finds have been found here, which have given their name to the Vendel Period. Vendel Church (Vendels kyrka) was probably began to be built in Romanesque style during the latter half of the 13th century. Around 1450, the church was vaulted with brick vaults. The church is most noted for its murals by Johannes Iwan who worked in Uppland during the 15th century. Archaeological research Helmet from a 7th-century ship burial, Vendel In 1881 to 1883, several excavations by Swedish archaeologist Hjalmar Stolpe (1841 - 1905) revealed 14 graves in and just beyond the south-east corner of the churchyard. Several of the burials were contained in boats up to 9 m long, and they were richly furnished with arrangements of weapons (including fine swords), helmets, cauldrons and chains, beads, shields, tools etc. The helmets from Graves 1, 12 and 14 bear close comparison to the helmet from the early 7th century ship-burial at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk, England, with die- stamped plaques depicting scenes of warriors. The shield from Grave 12 at Vendel is also very comparable to the Sutton Hoo shield, and has a stamped metal strip mount which is actually die-linked to an equivalent piece at Sutton Hoo. The Vendel boats were identified by the presence of many ship- rivets, and accompanied by many animal sacrifices (mainly horses) within the burials. A later grave (Grave 3) contained an important set of bridle-mounts for a horse. These graves date between the later 6th to 8th centuries. At Husby near Vendel there is a large mound which local tradition calls Ottarsh√∂gen from Ottar also known as Ohthere and h√∂g, meaning mound or barrow. Ohthere is associated with the person of that same name in the epic Beowulf. An excavation in 1917 revealed the remains of a powerful man who was buried at the beginning of the 6th century, the time of Ohthere. Other graves of similar date, associated with Ohthere's family, are at Old Uppsala. Vendel has given its name to a period (the Vendel Age) in the Scandinavian Iron Age, and to the corresponding Vendel style in art. It has often been suggested that the Germanic Vandals, or at least their kings or rulers, were connected to the site. In this it is coupled with the name of a companion site at Valsg√§rde in the same region. The close comparisons with the 27-metre ship burial at Sutton Hoo show a direct connection between the armourers producing work found at the two sites, a connection central to the understanding of both. The Sutton Hoo burial is often associated with King Raedwald of East Anglia, (ruled c 599-624), who in his later reign (c 616-624) was most powerful among the rulers of the English kingdoms.

Seen from afar (e.g. an approaching airplane) and depending on the direction of view with respect to the Sun, haze may appear brownish or bluish, while mist tends to be bluish grey. Whereas haze often is thought of as a phenomenon of dry air, mist formation is a phenomenon of humid air. However, haze particles may act as condensation nuclei for the subsequent formation of mist droplets; such forms of haze are known as \\"wet haze.\\" In meteorological literature, the word haze is generally used to denote visibility-reducing aerosols of the wet type. Such aerosols commonly arise from complex chemical reactions that occur as sulfur dioxide gases emitted during combustion are converted into small droplets of sulfuric acid. The reactions are enhanced in the presence of sunlight, high relative humidity, and stagnant air flow. A small component of wet-haze aerosols appear to be derived from compounds released by trees, such as terpenes. For all these reasons, wet haze tends to be primarily a warm-season phenomenon. Large areas of haze covering many thousands of kilometers may be produced under favorable conditions each summer. Air pollution Haze often occurs when dust and smoke particles accumulate in relatively dry air. When weather conditions block the dispersal of smoke and other pollutants they concentrate and form a usually low-hanging shroud that impairs visibility and may become a respiratory health threat. Industrial pollution can result in dense haze, which is known as smog. Since 1991, haze has been a particularly acute problem in Southeast Asia. The main source of the haze has been fires occurring in Sumatra and Borneo. In response to the 1997 Southeast Asian haze, the ASEAN countries agreed on a Regional Haze Action Plan (1997). In 2002, all ASEAN countries signed the Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, but the pollution is still a problem today. Under the agreement, the ASEAN secretariat hosts a co-ordination and support unit.ASEAN action hazeonline During the 2013 Southeast Asian haze, Singapore experienced a record high pollution level, with the 3-hour Pollution Standards Index reaching a record high of 401. In the United States, the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) program was developed as a collaborative effort between the US EPA and the National Park Service in order to establish the chemical composition of haze in National Parks and establish air pollution control measures in order to restore the visibility to pre-industrial levels.IMPROVE Visibility Program Additionally, the Clean Air Act requires that any current visibility problems be remedied, and future visibility problems be prevented, in 156 Class I Federal areas located throughout the United States. A full list of these areas is available on EPA's website.Federal Class 1 Areas = International disputes =  Transboundary haze  Haze is no longer a domestic problem. It has become one of the causes of international disputes among neighboring countries. Haze migrates to adjacent countries and thereby pollutes other countries as well. One of the most recent problems occur in Southeast Asia which largely affects the nations of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. In 2013, due to forest fires in Indonesia, Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas became shrouded in a pall of noxious fumes, smelling of ash and coal for more than a week, in the country's worst environmental crisis since 1997. The main sources of the haze are Indonesia's Sumatra Island, Indonesian areas of Borneo, and Riau, where farmers, plantation owners and miners have set hundreds of fires in the forests to clear land during dry weather. Winds blow most of the fumes across the narrow Strait of Malacca to Malaysia, although parts of Indonesia are also affected.Hazardous haze envelops Kuala Lumpur - World news - Environment NBC News The 2015 Southeast Asian haze was another major crisis, although there were occasions such as the 2006 and 2019 haze which were less impactful than the three major Southeast Asian haze of 1997, 2013 and 2015. Obscuration Haze causes issues in the area of terrestrial photography, where the penetration of large amounts of dense atmosphere may be necessary to image distant subjects. This results in the visual effect of a loss of contrast in the subject, due to the effect of light scattering through the haze particles. For these reasons, sunrise and sunset colors appear subdued on hazy days, and stars may be obscured at night. In some cases, attenuation by haze is so great that, toward sunset, the sun disappears altogether before reaching the horizon.Figure 1. \\"The setting sun dimmed by dense haze over State College, Pennsylvania on 16 September 1992\\". Haze can be defined as an aerial form of the Tyndall effect therefore unlike other atmospheric effects such as cloud and fog, haze is spectrally selective: shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more, and longer (red/infrared) wavelengths are scattered less. For this reason, many super-telephoto lenses often incorporate yellow filters or coatings to enhance image contrast. Infrared (IR) imaging may also be used to penetrate haze over long distances, with a combination of IR-pass optical filters and IR-sensitive detectors. Haze as smoke pollution over the Mojave from fires in the Inland Empire, June, 2016, demonstrates the loss of contrast to the Sun, and the landscape in general.

The round circle behind the helmet shows the probable size of the shield. Valsg√§rde or Vallsg√§rde is a farm on the Fyris river, about three kilometres north of Gamla Uppsala, the ancient centre of the Swedish kings and of the pagan faith in Sweden. The present farm dates from the 16th century. The farm's notability derives from the presence of a burial site from the Swedish Vendel Age (part of the Iron Age (c. 550‚Äì793) and the Viking Age); it was used for more than 300 years. The first ship burial is from the 6th century and the last graves are from the 11th century. Excavation The Vikings Begin 55 - warrior sword, 7th century The site was found and excavated by archaeologists in the 1920s, and before this similar graves had only been found at Vendel, which gave its name to this period of the Scandinavian Iron Age. The graves are princely, and are almost identical to ones found in England, at Sutton Hoo in East Anglia dated up to 610-635. There are several theories about the identities of those buried, ranging from the Ynglings (Scylfings) to powerful warriors within the Leidang system, or local strongmen who had enriched themselves through trade due to the area's strategic position between the fjord of M√§laren and the important region of Tiundaland. There are so many rich graves that it is likely that most of them were royalty. References *Arwidsson, Greta (1942) Valsg√§rde 6 (Almqvist & Wiksells Boktryckeri-A.B.

He was born in Owosso, Michigan and received his B.S. in chemistry at Michigan State University in 1930 and his Ph.D. in bacteriology in 1934, taking a position shortly thereafter at the Department of Bacteriology at Washington University in St. Louis. He began performing experiments with bacteriophages with Italian-American Salvador Luria, German Max Delbr√ºck, Indian-Canadian Adam Hasnain, and Serbian Mila Huhtala in 1940, and observed that when two different strains of bacteriophage have infected the same bacteria, the two viruses may exchange genetic information. He moved with his research partner Martha Chase to Laurel Hollow, New York, in 1950 to join the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Genetics, where he and Martha Chase performed the famous Hershey‚ÄìChase experiment in 1952. This experiment provided additional evidence that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material of life. Notable post-doctoral fellows in Hershey's lab include Anna Marie Skalka. He became director of the Carnegie Institution (which later became Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) in 1962 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969, shared with Salvador Luria and Max Delbr√ºck for their discovery on the replication of viruses and their genetic structure. In 1981, Hershey became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Hershey had one child, Peter Manning Hershey (1956-1999) with his wife Harriet (often called Jill) (1918-2000). The family was active in the social network of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and regularly enjoyed the beach in season. Hershey was a Christian. After Hershey died, another phage worker, Frank Stahl, wrote: \\"The Phage Church, as we were sometimes called (see Phage group), was led by the Trinity of Delbr√ºck, Luria, and Hershey.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on September 19, 1942. The cartoon is a parody of the Rover Boys, a popular juvenile fiction book series of the early 20th century. In 1994, the cartoon was voted No. 49 of The 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. Summary The scene descends upon Pimento University (\\"good old P.U.\\"), the college where the three inseparable Dover brothers, athletic oldest brother Tom (on a tandem bicycle with a perpetual wheelie), middle child Dick (on a self- propelled penny-farthing whose pedals are too far away for Dick to reach), and portly, curly-haired youngest brother Larry (on a tricycle), attend school. \\"A gay outing at the park has been planned by the merry trio, and they are off to fetch 'their' fianc√©e, dainty Dora Standpipe, at Miss Cheddar's Female Academy, close by.\\" The Boys are called upon to rescue Dora when she is kidnapped by the nefarious stock villain Dan Backslide. \\"The former sneak of Roquefort Hall, coward, bully, cad, and thief, and arch-enemy of the Dover Boys,\\" his feelings for Dora are summed up in his comment, \\"How I love her! ‚Ä¶ (father's money!)\\" Backslide then steals a conveniently placed, unoccupied runabout (after loudly declaring his intention to do so, claiming that \\"No one will ever know!\\"), which he uses to kidnap an oblivious Dora while she and the Dover Boys are playing hide-and-seek, spiriting her away to a remote mountain lodge. But Backslide soon discovers that, despite appearances, Dora is anything but dainty; she proceeds to administer a sound thrashing to the villain, all the while acting the damsel in distress--crying for help and pounding on the door (with the locks on her side) and on Backslide--until he is himself crying out for help from Tom, Dick, and Larry. Although the boys had heard Dora's cries for help, it is not until \\"an alert young scout\\" witnesses Dora's captivity, then sends a distress signal via semaphore, then via telegram, to the boys that they respond by breaking the messenger's tandem bike into three unicycles and race to the scene. When the Dover Boys finally arrive, they lay a few punches on the by-now barely conscious Backslide before managing to knock each other out in unison as Backslide collapses to the floor safely beneath their swinging fists. Dora is then escorted away by an odd grey-bearded man in a nineteenth-century bathing suit and sailor's cap who was a running gag throughout the cartoon, appearing periodically to interrupt the story by shuffling across the screen to the tune of Ed Haley's \\"While Strolling Through the Park One Day\\". He and Dora proceed to shuffle off into the sunset as the cartoon concludes with the familiar iris-out. From time to time throughout the cartoon, the Boys lapse into various renditions of their alma mater, sung to the tune of George Cooper and Henry Tucker's \\"Sweet Genevieve\\": \\"Pimento U, Oh sweet P.U., thy fragrant odor scents the air\\" etc. The entire cartoon is filled with puns on the Rover Boys series: The occurrences of the names Pimento, Cheddar, and Roquefort reflect the Rover Boys' old school of Colby Hall; Tom, Dick and Larry borrow their names from Tom, Sam and Dick Rover (as well as the generic names Tom, Dick and Harry), Dora Standpipe is named after Tom Rover's fianc√©e Dora Stanhope and Dan Backslide is named after Rover Boys villain Dan Baxter. Production According to Jones, Schlesinger and the Warner Bros. studio executives were less than pleased when they screened The Dover Boys because of the extensive use of limited animation and drybrush smears, and the executives went through the process of attempting to fire him despite the fact that the studio wanted him to abandon his Disney-like animation.Beck, Jerry (editor) (1994). The 50 Greatest Cartoons. Atlanta: Turner Publishing. Pg. 182.Chuck Jones: Extremes and In-betweens - A Life in Animation (PBS 2000) A replacement for Jones could not be easily found due to labor shortages stemming from World War II, so he was kept aboard. Although voice credits from Warner Bros. cartoons are not easy to find beyond Mel Blanc (who, using more or less his normal voice, portrays Dan Backslide), it is assumed that John McLeish voiced the part of the narrator (he performed a similar role as the stately, unctuous narrator on several Goofy shorts for the Disney studio). The voice of Tom Dover was performed by long-time Termite Terrace writer Tedd Pierce, who also provided the story. Vocal harmonies were provided by The Sportsmen Quartet, from Jack Benny's radio program. Dora was voiced by Bea Benaderet. Dan Backslide's character design was a caricature of Jones' animator Ken Harris. McLeish also narrated the cartoon The Rocky Road to Ruin of Color Rhapsody from Columbia Pictures and Screen Gems, adding to the similarity between it and The Dover Boys on top of similar character design and what was then called the \\"modern\\" visual style of cartoons, which evolved into the UPA style. On top of having one of the largest casts of voice talent in one WB cartoon, it also clocked in at nearly nine minutes, a full two minutes longer than the average Warner Brothers cartoon (about 6:50). Legacy The characters Tom, Dick, and Larry would later make cameo appearances (voiced respectively by Jon Bauman, Jeff Bennett and Rob Paulsen) on the 1990s Fox and WB network series Animaniacs, alongside Slappy Squirrel in \\"Frontier Slappy,\\" while singing discrediting lyrics about Daniel Boone (voiced by Jim Cummings),The Dover Boys on Animaniacs by Nathan Stanfield-YouTube the Warners in \\"Magic Time\\", and in Wakko's Wish. A short clip of this cartoon is featured in the opening credits of \\"Less Than Hero\\", an episode of another Fox TV show, Futurama. They also appeared cheering in the stands late in the 1996 animation/live-action movie Space Jam. A segment of the cartoon is featured briefly in an episode of Agent Carter where it is used as part of a subliminal messaging tool of the Black Widow program. With the advent of the Internet, the short gained newfound attention from younger generations, in part because it is one of the few Warner Bros. shorts from that era that fell into the public domain, although it has seen releases from MGM/UA Home Video and Warner Home Video.Night Flight 60s Episode NBC WOC 1991 10-Internet ArchiveCartoon: The Dover Boys (1942)-MyFootage.com on YouTube The younger generation were drawn to the animation style, absurd and non sequitur humor, and the satirization of the values of the time period, and the cartoon has led to many internet memes as a result, one being Dan's quote \\"A runabout? I'll steal it! No one will ever know!\\". In 2018, to mark the short's 76th anniversary, a collaborative effort of over 90 independent animators recreated the short scene for scene with each animator drawing in their own style. The collaboration was known as ‚ÄúThe Dover Boys Reanimated Collab!‚Äù was created by animator Zeurel and released on August 27, 2018 on YouTube. The collab has received critically acclaim with over two million views. In 2019, Vivziepop animated series, Hazbin Hotel made a cameo to the villain of the short Dan Backslide being like a cartoon that watching her in a bar in Hell when she doesn't see him in Charile's discussion.

History  Vladimir Gusinsky founded NTV in 1993, attracting talented journalists and news anchors of the time such as Tatiana Mitkova, Leonid Parfyonov, Mikhail Osokin, Yevgeniy Kiselyov, Vladimir A. Kara-Murza, Victor Shenderovich and others. The channel set high professional standards in Russian television, broadcasting live coverage and sharp analysis of current events. Starting before the dissolution of Soviet Union as Fourth Programme, the channel broadcast a daily news programme Segodnya and a weekly news-commentary programme Itogi.G. Kertman, Star Wars (Political Commentators on Television) , The Public Opinion Foundation, 1 March 2000. In the early 1990s, , a multibillion-dollar advertising agency, obtained exclusive advertising rights on NTV. It commented favorably on President Boris Yeltsin's re-election campaign in 1996. By 1999 NTV had achieved an audience of 102 million, covering about 70% of Russia's territory, and was available in other former Soviet republics.NTV: Timeline of events, CNN, 10 April 2001. During parliamentary elections in 1999 and presidential elections in 2000, NTV was critical of the Second Chechen War, Vladimir Putin and the political party Unity backed by him. In the puppet show Kukly in the beginning of February 2000, the puppet of Putin acted as Little Zaches in a story based on E.T.A. Hoffmann's \\"Little Zaches called Cinnabar\\", in which blindness causes villagers mistake an evil gnome for a beautiful youth.Viktor Shenderovich, \\"Tales From Hoffman\\" (48‚Äì57), Index on Censorship, Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, p. 49. This provoked a fierce reaction from Putin's supporters. On 8 February the newspaper Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti published a letter signed by the Rector of St. Petersburg State University Lyudmila Verbitskaya, the Dean of its Law Department Nikolay Kropachyov and some of Putin's other presidential campaign assistants that urged the prosecution of the authors of the show for what they considered a criminal offence. = Talk show with people of Ryazan and FSB members = On 24 March 2000, two days before the presidential elections, NTV featured the Ryazan apartment bombing of Fall 1999 in the talk show Independent Investigation. The talk with the residents of the Ryazan apartment building along with FSB public relations director Alexander Zdanovich and Ryazan branch head Alexander Sergeyev was filmed few days earlier. On 26 March, Boris Nemtsov voiced his concern over the possible shut- down of NTV for airing the talk. FSB is blowing up Russia: Chapter 5. FSB vs the People , Alexander Litvinenko, Yuri Felshtinsky, Novaya Gazeta, 27 August 2001 (computer translation) Seven months later, NTV general manager Igor Malashenko said at the JFK School of Government that Information Minister Mikhail Lesin warned him on several occasions.

Critics considered this move politically motivated, as NTV voiced opposition to Putin since his presidential electoral campaign. Putin denied any involvement.

Accordingly, in the following episode of the show, called \\"Ten Commandments\\", the puppet of Putin was replaced with a cloud covering the top of a mountain and a burning bush. The program Itogi went on investigating corruption in the Russian government and the autumn 1999 blasts in Russia. On 13 June 2000, Gusinsky was detained as a suspect in the General Prosecutor Office's criminal investigation of fraud between his Media-Most holding, Russkoye Video - 11th Channel Ltd. and the federal enterprise Russkoye Video. At the time, Media-Most was involved in a dispute over the loan received from Gazprom.

On 15 July, the puppet of Putin acted in the Kukly show as Girolamo Savonarola. On 19 July, investigators of the office of the Prosecutor General of Russia came to Gusinsky's home, distrained and arrested his property. In a surprisingly informal deal, the charges against Gusinsky were lifted after he signed an agreement with Mikhail Lesin, Minister of Media, on 20 July. Under the \\"shares for freedom\\" transaction or Protocol No.6 (–ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª N.6. –î–æ–ª—è —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥—ã) agreement, Gusinsky would discharge his debts by selling Media-Most to Gazprom-Media, which had held a 30% share of NTV since 1996, for the price imposed by the latter, and was given a guarantee that he would not be prosecuted. After leaving the country, Gusinsky claimed he was pressured to sign the agreement by the prospect of the criminal investigation. Media-Most refused to comply with the agreement. Tax authorities brought a suit against Media-Most aiming to wind it up. On 26 January 2001, Gazprom announced that it had acquired a controlling stake of 46% in NTV. The voting rights of a 19% stake held by Media-Most was frozen by a court decision.Gazprom Takes Control of NTV, Kagan World Media, Ltd. 26 January 2001. Archived on the Internet Archive 28 March 2006. Putin met with leading NTV journalists on 29 January, but the meeting changed nothing. The parties reasserted their positions; Putin denied any involvement and said that he could not interfere with the prosecutors and courts.Viktor Shenderovich, \\"Tales From Hoffman\\" (sic) (48‚Äì57), Index on Censorship, Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, p. 53. Around that time American media mogul Ted Turner (owner and founder of the Turner Broadcasting System subsidiary of Time Warner) appeared to be going to buy Gusinsky's share, but this has never happened. On 3 April, Gazprom Media headed by Alfred Kokh by violating the procedure conducted a shareholders' meeting which removed Kiselyov from the NTV Director General position. On 14 April 2001, Gazprom took over NTV by force and brought in its own management team. Its director-general Yevgeniy Kiselyov was replaced by Boris Jordan. Many leading journalists, including Yevgeniy Kiselyov, Svetlana Sorokina, Viktor Shenderovich, Vladimir A. Kara-Murza, Dmitry Dibrov, left the company. Leonid Parfyonov and Tatyana Mitkova remained. Kiselyov's Itogi program was closed down, replaced by Parfyonov's Namedni. Citizens concerned by the threat to the freedom of speech in Russia argued that the financial pressure was inspired by the Vladimir Putin's government, which was often subject to NTV's criticism. Some tens of thousands of Russians rallied to the call of dissident NTV journalists in order to support the old NTV staff in April 2001. Within the next couple of years, two independent TV channels which absorbed the former NTV journalists, TV-6 and TVS, were also shut down.Viktor Shenderovich, \\"Tales From Hoffman\\" (sic) (48‚Äì57), Index on Censorship, Volume 37, Number 1, 2008, p. 55.

In January 2003, Boris Jordan was ousted as director general and replaced by Nikolay Senkevich, son of TV-presenter Yuri Senkevich from Channel One.Tom Birchenough, Senkevich bounds to top NTV slot, Variety, 23 January 2003. A few days earlier he was also discharged from Media-Most director-general position, where he had replaced Alfred Kokh in October 2001. As insiders claimed, Jordan was sacked because NTV had carried a live translation of the culmination of the Moscow theater siege in October 2002 and had been too critical of the way authorities handled it. Since then, entertaining talk-shows have become more prominent on NTV, rather than political programmes. However, unlike other leading TV channels in Russia, NTV went on reporting on-the-fly about some opposition activities and government failures, including the conflagrating fire of the Moscow Manege on the day of the Russian presidential elections on 14 March 2004, and the assassination of the pro-Russian President of Chechnya Akhmad Kadyrov on Victory Day 9 May 2004. On 1 June 2004, Leonid Parfyonov, one of the last leading journalists from the old NTV staff who remained, and who was still critical of the government, was ousted from the channel, and his weekly news commentary programme Namedni was taken off the air.Nick Paton Walsh, Television station sacks Kremlin's last critic, The Guardian (UK), 3 June 2004.Leonid Parfenov Sacked from NTV , Kommersant (Russia), 2 June 2004.

The original \\"Tessie\\" was from the 1902 Broadway musical The Silver Slipper. The newer song, written in 2004, recounts how the singing of the original \\"Tessie\\" by the Royal Rooters fan club helped the Boston Americans win the first World Series in 1903. The name Tessie itself is a diminutive form used with several names, including Esther, Tess, and Theresa/Teresa. Broadway & Royal Rooters version The original version of \\"Tessie (You Are the Only, Only, Only)\\" was written by Will R. Anderson and was featured in the Broadway musical The Silver Slipper, which ran for 160 performances between October 27, 1902 and March 14, 1903. The song was about a woman singing to her beloved parakeet \\"Tessie\\". While a popular tune, the song gained greater notoriety when it was adopted as a rallying cry by the Royal Rooters, a collection of loyal fans led by Michael T. McGreevy, informally known as \\"Nuf Ced\\" McGreevy, owner of the 3rd Base saloon. McGreevy earned his nickname \\"Nuf Ced\\" due to the way he kept peace in his bar: when he grew frustrated with arguments over the Boston Americans (who would later be renamed the Red Sox) and the Boston Braves (who would later move to Milwaukee and, eventually, Atlanta), he would pound his hand on the bar and declare \\"'Nuff [enough] said!\\". Boston mayor John \\"Honey Fitz\\" Fitzgerald, grandfather of President John F. Kennedy, was a member of the Royal Rooters. After the first four games of the 1903 World Series, Boston was down 1-3 to the Pittsburgh Pirates. (It was a best-of-nine series; five wins were needed to win the series.) The Royal Rooters began rallying their team with every song they could think of; ultimately \\"Tessie\\" helped win the day. There are stories that the Royal Rooters actually traveled to Pittsburgh and hired a band to play \\"Tessie\\" to annoy the Pirates on their home field. Pittsburgh outfielder Tommy Leach credited at least part of Boston's win to \\"that damn 'Tessie' song.\\" He continued: \\"It was a real hum-dinger of a song, but it sort of got on your nerves after a while.\\" Boston won Game 5 and went on to win Games 6, 7, and 8 to win the Series. The Boston fans remembered \\"Tessie\\" fondly through the years; Burt Mustin, who decades later became a prolific \\"old man\\" character actor in movies and television, was still regaling audiences with \\"Tessie\\" stories while in his nineties. The chorus to the original \\"Tessie\\" goes: :Tessie, you make me feel so badly. :Why don't you turn around? :Tessie, you know I love you madly. :Babe, my heart weighs about a pound. :Don't blame me if I ever doubt you, :You know I wouldn't live without you. :Tessie, you are the only, only, only. The fans began inventing their own lyrics to taunt the Pittsburgh players, such as: :Honus, why do you hit so badly? :Take a back seat and sit down :Honus, at bat you look so sadly. :Hey, why don't you get out of town? etc. The Rooters stopped singing in 1918. The Red Sox won the World Series in 1918 but then endured an 86-year drought before winning again in 2004, the same year a re-release of \\"Tessie\\" was issued by the Dropkick Murphys. In the 2000s a group of Red Sox fans recreated the track with those lyrics and an additional two stanzas in addition to finishing the Wagner stanza. :Honus, why do you hit so badly? :Take a back seat and sit down :Honus, at bat you look so sadly. :Hey, why don't you get out of town? :Go find another team to hit for :Pittsburgh is just the pits and therefore :Honus, you are a phony phony phony They also wrote a stanza on Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez: :A-Rod you're overpaid overrated :Why do we hate you so :Your contract should be terminated :Because you don't deserve to be making all that dough (300 Million) :You almost got away with cheatin' :But the Red Sox weren't the team to be beatin' :A-Rod you are a hanky panky Yankee. Yankee captain Derek Jeter also got a stanza. Dropkick Murphys version In 2004, the Boston-area celtic punk group Dropkick Murphys recorded a cover of \\"Tessie\\", released on an EP of the same name. The Dropkicks said it was their intent to \\"bring back the spirit of the Rooters and to put the Red Sox back on top.\\" The goal of the Dropkicks was realized when later that year the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years. The song is also featured as the bonus track on their June 2005 release The Warrior's Code with a lead-in from the WEEI broadcast of the final play in the 2004 World Series: \\"Swing and a ground ball, stabbed by Foulke. He has it. He underhands to first. And the Boston Red Sox are the World Champions. For the first time in 86 years, the Red Sox have won baseball's world championship. Can you believe it?\\" -Joe Castiglione The second \\"Tessie\\" -- which featured backing vocals from Red Sox players Johnny Damon, Bronson Arroyo, and Lenny DiNardo, Red Sox Vice President of Public Affairs Dr. Charles Steinberg; and Boston Herald sportswriter Jeff Horrigan (who co-wrote the new lyrics with the Dropkick Murphys) -- has become a theme song for the Red Sox and tells the story of the Royal Rooters singing the original \\"Tessie\\". The song is featured in the soundtrack to the 2005 movie, Fever Pitch, and is the song used in the closing credits to the VHS and DVD review of the 2004 World Series, a video that was produced by Major League Baseball Productions. The video game MVP Baseball 2005 features the song. In addition to \\"Tessie\\", the EP includes \\"Fields of Athenry\\", \\"Nut Rocker\\" (an instrumental rock version of the Boston Bruins theme song), \\"The Burden\\" as performed live on WBCN, \\"Tessie (Old Timey Baseball Version)\\" in which the song is accompanied primarily by a ballpark organ, as well as a music video for \\"Tessie.\\" Proceeds from the sale of the EP went to benefit the Red Sox Foundation. (\\"Nut Rocker\\" inspired \\"Nutty\\" by the Ventures, which was long associated with the Boston Bruins hockey team, as it was the theme song for Bruins telecasts on WSBK-TV.) \\"Tessie\\" is the second of three songs played after every Red Sox win at Fenway Park, the first being \\"Dirty Water\\" by The Standells. The third is \\"Joy to the World\\" by Three Dog Night. Trot Nixon used \\"Tessie\\" as his at-bat intro music when he played for the Red Sox. \\"Tessie\\" was played at the end of regulation, prior to the start of overtime during the National Hockey League's 2010 Winter Classic at Fenway Park. A synthesized version of \\"Tessie\\" is used by Red Sox ticketing, as the signal a customer has been selected from the team's virtual waiting room to purchase tickets during busy periods. The Dropkick Murphys tell this version of the story in the liner notes of their album The Warrior's Code: Inspiration for Red Sox mascots In the winter of 2015-16, it was stated that the as-yet \\"unknown\\" young sister of the popular Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster, aptly named Tessie, was going to join her famous \\"older brother\\" at Red Sox games starting in the 2016 MLB season.

Musicians and music As for all the previous albums Elling is accompanied by a piano trio led by his musical partner Laurence Hobgood, bassist Rob Amster and with Frank Parker Jr. a new drummer again. Paul Wertico, formerly behind the drum set, is only heard on the first track. The \\"sonic idea\\" for the album was to add vibraphonist Stefon Harris who appears now on several tracks and is named on the album cover.Liner notes on Kurt Elling homepage. Furthermore soprano saxophonists Jim Gailloreto and Brad Wheeler perform as guest musicians. On some tracks Elling uses overdubs of his voice. Seven of the twelve tracks are adaptations of originally instrumental compositions to which Elling wrote lyrics to, most prominently John Coltrane's \\"Resolution\\" from his epic cycle A Love Supreme. Besides \\"Resolution\\" and \\"A Secret I\\", i.e. Herbie Hancock's \\"Alone and I\\" from his debut Takin' Off, the entry track \\"Minuano\\" written by Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays (from Metheny's Still Life (Talking)) formed the basic material for Man in the Air, initially should have been the opener for This Time It's Love, but the label convinced the musicians that it did not fit the album's character, it was \\"too futurist for this side\\" as Elling put it in hindsight.Liner notes to This Time It's Love on Kurt Elling homepage. The other compositions Elling and Hobgood adapted were by Joe Zawinul (\\"Time to Say Goodbye\\", i.e. \\"A Remark You Made\\" from Heavy Weather), Courtney Pine (\\"Higher Vibe\\" from Underground) and Bobby Watson (\\"Hidden Jewel\\" from Jewel). The last track of the album, \\"All Is Quiet\\", a duo by Elling and Hobgood, is a composition by Bob Mintzer, who already recorded the song together with Elling in 1998 on The Yellowjackets album Club Nocturne and in 2002 with the Bob Mintzer Big Band (Live at MCG with Special Guest Kurt Elling). Reception \\"This is perhaps the jazz vocal album of the last decade. Almost ten years on from his debut, Elling delivers a bold and accomplished performance, marked by highly original choice of material and some devastating playing from his regular band\\", write Richard Cook and Brian Morton in their Penguin Guide to Jazz. \\"Elling's scat and his delivery of a ballad are now so confident that he is able to take on material like John Coltrane's 'Resolution' and bring to it a genuine philosophical understanding as well as a musically coherent performance.\\" In 2006 they concluded: \\"This is a remarkable record, as accessible as it is challenging.\\" In their definitve Penguin Jazz Guide from 2010 they did not change any of the review but went even further closing: \\"It is so good, it's almost sinful.\\"Cook, Richard and Morton, Brian (2010), The Penguin Jazz Guide, London: Penguin Books, p. 685, Thom Jurek of AllMusic is equally eloquent in his praise and stresses too Elling's mature interpretation of \\"Resolution\\" while also recognizing \\"a new way\\" for listeners to access the composer John Coltrane. And like Cook and Morton he sees the importance of Laurence Hobgood: \\"Hobgood is a criminally under-recognized pianist. His sense of harmonic architecture and melodic invention are among the most innovative of the current grown-up generation of jazz players, and his allowance for space and nuance acts as a perfect foil for Elling's rigorous restructuring of intervals and cadences.\\" Man in the Air received a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, the sixth successive nomination in that category since Elling's debut and seventh nomination in total.Kurt Elling on Grammy homepage.

Lake Dunstan is a man-made lake and reservoir in the South Island of New Zealand. The lake was formed on the Clutha River as a result of the construction of the Clyde Dam, filling in four controlled stages beginning in April 1992 and completed the next year. Parts of the town of Cromwell were relocated to a new area above the new lake. Between the town of Cromwell and the Clyde Dam the lake passes through what is called the Cromwell Gorge. Lake Dunstan provides irrigation for nearby stone fruit orchards and vineyards, and is a major recreational asset, with facilities for boating, waterskiing, fishing, parapenting, and rowing. The dam and lake became well known in New Zealand due to media coverage of the geological problems during its construction. While the dam was being built at least one landslide occurred at Cairnmuir, a series of bluffs overlooking the gorge where the dam was built. All parties involved denied responsibility for not finding the problem. Because of the expense of stabilising the gorge walls and the changing economic climate, this was also the last of the Third National Government's Think Big projects. Protests There was vocal protest against the project from the local community, with calls for the planning and project to cease. Environmentalists, scientists, lawyers, recreational river users, families that had lived here for generations, and others that had recently moved to the area protested, none seemingly more poignantly than the artists. There was a perception that the power from the dam was intended for an aluminium smelter near Dunedin. Prominent figures including Ralph Hotere, Andrew Drummond, Chris Cree-Brown and Chris Booth did significant and powerful work that related to the smelter issue, gaining publicity and acclaim with exhibitions and appropriate comment in various art magazines. Other artists worked on the dam issue: Robin Morrison created a sensitive series of portraits on the residents affected by the flooding; Marilynn Webb a compelling series of prints called \\"Good Bye- Clutha Blue\\" in 1983; Bruce Foster a series of Ciba-chrome prints investigating the pre-construction lines painted on the land, and Lloyd Godman a significant series of large photo-mural prints, toned with gold from the Clutha River, entitled ‚ÄúThe Last River's Song‚Äù. During the filling of the dam to form Lake Dunstan in 1992‚Äì93, Godman also completed a series of performance works entitled \\"Lake Fill\\", which involved using an underwater camera to take a series of photographs of a selected vista up the river showing its gradual obliteration due to the rising lake level.

Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 52 =Twelve a·πÖgas= The Dharmaguptaka used a twelvefold division of the Buddhist teachings, which has been found in their Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama, their Vinaya, and in some MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras.Williams, Paul. The Origins and Nature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. 2004. p. 184 These twelve divisions are: s≈´tra, geya, vyƒÅkara·πáa, gƒÅthƒÅ, udƒÅna, nidƒÅna, jƒÅtaka, itiv·πõttaka, vaipulya, adbh≈´tadharma, avadƒÅna, and upade≈õa. Appearance and language =Robes= Between 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which described the color of monastic robes (Skt. kƒÅ·π£ƒÅya) utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi ().Hino, Shoun. Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. p. 55 Another text translated at a later date, the ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, contains a very similar passage with nearly the same information. However, the colors for Dharmaguptaka and SarvƒÅstivƒÅda are reversed. In the earlier source, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda are described as wearing deep red robes, while the Dharmaguptaka are described as wearing black robes.Hino, Shoun. Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. pp. 55-56 The corresponding passage found in the later ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, in contrast, portrays the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda as wearing black robes and the Dharmaguptaka as wearing deep red robes. During the Tang dynasty, Chinese Buddhist monastics typically wore grayish-black robes and were even colloquially referred to as Zƒ´yƒ´ (), \\"those of the black robes.\\"Kieschnick, John. The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture. 2003. pp. 89-90 However, the Song dynasty monk Zanning (919‚Äì1001 CE) writes that during the earlier Han-Wei period, the Chinese monks typically wore red robes.Kieschnick, John. The Eminent Monk: Buddhist Ideals in Medieval Chinese Hagiography. 1997. p. 29 According to the Dharmaguptaka vinaya, the robes of monastics should be sewn out of no more than 18 pieces of cloth, and the cloth should be fairly heavy and coarse.Kieschnick, John. The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture. 2003. pp. 91-92 =Language= A consensus has grown in scholarship which sees the first wave of Buddhist missionary work as associated with the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language and the Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ script and tentatively with the Dharmaguptaka sect. However, there is evidence that other sects and traditions of Buddhism also used GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´, and further evidence that the Dharmaguptaka sect also used Sanskrit at times: Starting in the first century of the Common Era, there was a large trend toward a type of GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ which was heavily Sanskritized. History =In Northwest India= The Gandharan Buddhist texts, the earliest Buddhist texts ever discovered, are apparently dedicated to the teachers of the Dharmaguptaka school. They tend to confirm a flourishing of the Dharmaguptaka school in northwestern India around the 1st century CE, with GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ as the canonical language, and this would explain the subsequent influence of the Dharmaguptakas in Central Asia and then northeastern Asia. According to Buddhist scholar A. K. Warder, the Dharmaguptaka originated in AparƒÅnta.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 278 According to one scholar, the evidence afforded by the Gandharan Buddhist texts \\"suggest[s] that the Dharmaguptaka sect achieved early success under their Indo-Scythian supporters in GandhƒÅra, but that the sect subsequently declined with the rise of the Ku·π£ƒÅ·πáa Empire (ca. mid-first to third century A.D.), which gave its patronage to the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda sect.\\"\\"The Discovery of 'the Oldest Buddhist Manuscripts'\\" Review article by Enomoto Fumio. The Eastern Buddhist, Vol NS32 Issue I, 2000, pg 161 =In Central Asia= Available evidence indicates that the first Buddhist missions to Khotan were carried out by the Dharmaguptaka sect: A number of scholars have identified three distinct major phases of missionary activities seen in the history of Buddhism in Central Asia, which are associated with the following sects, chronologically:Willemen, Charles. Dessein, Bart. Cox, Collett. Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism. 1997. p. 126 # Dharmagupta # SarvƒÅstivƒÅda # M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda In the 7th century CE, Xuanzang and Yijing both recorded that the Dharmaguptakas were located in O·∏ç·∏çiyƒÅna and Central Asia, but not in the Indian subcontinent. Yijing grouped the Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka, Dharmaguptaka, and KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´ya together as sub-sects of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, and stated that these three were not prevalent in the \\"five parts of India,\\" but were located in the some parts of O·∏ç·∏çiyƒÅna, Khotan, and Kucha.Yijing. Li Rongxi (translator). Buddhist Monastic Traditions of Southern Asia. 2000. p. 19 =In East Asia= bhik·π£u·πáƒ´ ordination is common in the Dharmaguptaka lineage. Vesak festival, Taiwan The Dharmaguptakas made more efforts than any other sect to spread Buddhism outside India, to areas such as Iran, Central Asia, and China, and they had great success in doing so. Therefore, most countries which adopted Buddhism from China, also adopted the Dharmaguptaka vinaya and ordination lineage for bhik·π£us and bhik·π£u·πáƒ´s. According to A. K. Warder, in some ways the Dharmaguptaka sect can be considered to have survived to the present in those East Asian countries.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 489 Warder further writes:Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. pp. 280-281 During the early period of Chinese Buddhism, the Indian Buddhist sects recognized as important, and whose texts were studied, were the Dharmaguptakas, Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsakas, KƒÅ≈õyapƒ´yas, SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins, and the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 281 Between 250 and 255 CE, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was established in China when Indian monks were invited to help with ordination in China. No full Vinaya had been translated at this time, and only two texts were available: the Dharmaguptaka KarmavƒÅcanƒÅ for ordination, and the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika PrƒÅtimok·π£a for regulating the life of monks. After the translation of full Vinayas, the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage was followed by most monks, but temples often regulated monastic life with other Vinaya texts, such as those of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika, the Mahƒ´≈õƒÅsaka, or the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda., pp. 187-189 In the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in Guanzhong (the region around Chang'an), and that the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was prominent in the Yangtze area and further south. In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as Yijing and Dao An (654-717). In the early 8th century, Dao An gained the support of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang and an imperial edict was issued that the sangha in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka vinaya for ordination.pp. 194-195 Texts =GandhƒÅran Buddhist texts= The GandhƒÅran Buddhist texts (the oldest extant Buddhist manuscripts) are attributed to the Dharmaguptaka sect by Richard Salomon, the leading scholar in the field, and the British Library scrolls \\"represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in NagarƒÅhƒÅra.\\"\\"The Discovery of 'the Oldest Buddhist Manuscripts'\\" Review article by Enomoto Fumio. The Eastern Buddhist, Vol NS32 Issue I, 2000, pg 160Richard Salomon. Ancient Buddhist Scrolls from GandhƒÅra: The British Library Kharosthƒ´ Fragments, with contributions by Raymond Allchin and Mark Barnard. Seattle: University of Washington Press; London: The British Library, 1999. pg 181 Among the Dharmaguptaka GandhƒÅran Buddhist texts in the Sch√∏yen Collection, is a fragment in the Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ script referencing the Six PƒÅramitƒÅs, a central practice for bodhisattvas in MahƒÅyƒÅna doctrine. =Vinaya translation= In the early 5th century CE, Dharmaguptaka Vinaya was translated into Chinese by the Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhaya≈õas (‰ΩõÈôÄËÄ∂Ëàç) of Kashmir. For this translation, Buddhaya≈õas recited the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya entirely from memory, rather than reading it from a written manuscript.Scharfe, Harmut. Education in Ancient India. 2002. pp. 24-25 After its translation, the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya became the predominant vinaya in Chinese Buddhist monasticism. The Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, or monastic rules, are still followed today in China, Vietnam and Korea, and its lineage for the ordination of monks and nuns has survived uninterrupted to this day. The name of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya in the East Asian tradition is the \\"Vinaya in Four Parts\\" (), and the equivalent Sanskrit title would be Caturvargika Vinaya.Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul. Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 3. 2004. p. 209 Ordination under the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya only relates to monastic vows and lineage (Vinaya), and does not conflict with the actual Buddhist teachings that one follows (Dharma). =ƒÄgama collections= The Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama (\\"Long Discourses,\\" Èï∑ÈòøÂê´Á∂ì Ch√°ng ƒÄh√°n Jƒ´ng) (T. 1)Muller, Charles. Digital Dictionary of Buddhism, entry on ÈòøÂê´Á∂ì corresponds to the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya of the Theravada school. A complete version of the Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama of the Dharmaguptaka sect was translated by Buddhaya≈õas and Zhu Fonian (Á´∫‰ΩõÂøµ) in the Later Qin dynasty, dated to 413 CE. It contains 30 s≈´tras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya. The Ekottara ƒÄgama (\\"Incremental Discourses,\\" Â¢ûÂ£πÈòøÂê´Á∂ì Zƒìngyƒ´ ƒÄh√°n Jƒ´ng) (T. 125) corresponds to the Anguttara NikƒÅya of the TheravƒÅda school. It was translated into Chinese by Dharmanandi in 384 CE, and edited by Gautama Sa·πÉghadeva in 398 CE. Some have proposed that the original text for this translation came from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins or the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. However, according to A.K. Warder, the Ekottara ƒÄgama references 250 prƒÅtimok·π£a rules for monks, which agrees only with the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya. He also views some of the doctrine as contradicting tenets of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school, and states that they agree with Dharmaguptaka views currently known. He therefore concludes that the extant Ekottara ƒÄgama is that of the Dharmaguptakas.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 6 =Abhidharma= The ≈öƒÅriputra Abhidharma ≈öƒÅstra (ËàçÂà©ÂºóÈòøÊØòÊõáË´ñ Sh√®l√¨f√∫ ƒÄp√≠t√°n L√πn) (T. 1548) is a complete abhidharma text that is thought to come from the Dharmaguptaka sect. The only complete edition of this text is in Chinese. Sanskrit fragments have been found in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and are now part of the Sch√∏yen Collection (MS 2375/08). These manuscripts are thought to have been part of a monastery library of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika LokottaravƒÅda sect. =Additional pi·π≠akas= The Dharmaguptaka Tripi·π≠aka is said to have contained two extra sections that were not included by some other schools. These included a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka and a Mantra Pi·π≠aka ( Zh√≤u Z√†ng), also sometimes called a DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ Pi·π≠aka. According to the fifth-century Dharmaguptaka monk Buddhaya≈õas, the translator of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya into Chinese, the Dharmaguptaka school had assimilated the \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna Tripi·π≠aka\\" ( D√†ch√©ng SƒÅnz√†ng).Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. pp. 52-53 =Abhini·π£krama·πáa S≈´tra= The Dharmaguptaka biography of the Buddha is the most exhaustive of all classical biographies of the Buddha, and is entitled Abhini·π£krama·πáa S≈´tra. Various Chinese translations of this text date from between the 3rd and 6th century CE. Relationship to MahƒÅyƒÅna Bhik·π£us performing a traditional Buddhist ceremony in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China =Kushan era= It is unknown when some members of the Dharmaguptaka school began to accept the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, but the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´m≈´lakalpa records that Kani·π£ka (127-151 CE) of the Ku·π£ƒÅ·πáa Empire presided over the establishment of Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ doctrines in the northwest of India.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. p. 410 TƒÅranƒÅtha wrote that in this region, 500 bodhisattvas attended the council at JƒÅlandhra monastery during the time of Kani·π£ka, suggesting some institutional strength for MahƒÅyƒÅna in the northwest during this period. Edward Conze goes further to say that Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ had great success in the northwest during the Ku·π£ƒÅ·πáa period, and may have been the \\"fortress and hearth\\" of early MahƒÅyƒÅna, but not its origin, which he associates with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. p. 426 =Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra= Jan Nattier writes that available textual evidence suggests that the MahƒÅyƒÅna Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra circulated in Dharmaguptaka communities during its early history, but a later translation shows evidence that the text later circulated amongst the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins as well.Nattier, Jan. A Few Good Men: Based on the Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ, a MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tra. 2007. pp. 46-47 The Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ also mentions a fourfold division of the Buddhist canon which includes a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, and the Dharmaguptaka are known to have had such a collection in their canon.Nattier, Jan. A Few Good Men: Based on the Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ, a MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tra. 2007. pp. 46 Nattier further describes the type of community depicted in the Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ:Nattier, Jan. A Few Good Men: Based on the Ugrapariprccha, a Mahayana Sutra. 2007. pp. 46-47 =RatnarƒÅ≈õivyƒÅkara·πáa S≈´tra= The MahƒÅyƒÅna RatnarƒÅ≈õivyƒÅkara·πáa S≈´tra, which is part of the MahƒÅratnak≈´·π≠a S≈´tra, is believed by some scholars to have a Dharmaguptaka origin or background, due to its specific regulations regarding giving to the Buddha and giving to the Sa·πÉgha.Silk, Jonathan. The Maharatnakuta Tradition: A Study of the Ratnarasi Sutra. Volume 1. 1994. pp. 253-254 =Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ s≈´tras= According to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the Pa√±cavi·πÉ≈õatisƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra (25,000 lines) and the ≈öatasƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra (100,000 lines) have a connection with the Dharmaguptaka sect, while the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra (8000 lines) does not.Williams, Paul. MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations. 2008. p. 6 Instead, Guang Xing assesses the view of the Buddha given in the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra (8000 lines) as being that of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas.Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 66 =Buddhaya≈õas= The translator Buddhaya≈õas was a Dharmaguptaka monk who was known to be a MahƒÅyƒÅnist, and he is recorded as having learned both Hƒ´nayƒÅna and MahƒÅyƒÅna treatises. He translated the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, the Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama, and MahƒÅyƒÅna texts including the ƒÄkƒÅ≈õagarbha Bodhisattva S≈´tra (ËôõÁ©∫ËóèËè©Ëñ©Á∂ì X≈´k≈çngz√†ng P√∫s√† Jƒ´ng). The preface written by Buddhaya≈õas for his translation of the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya states that the Dharmaguptakas had assimilated the MahƒÅyƒÅna Tripi·π≠aka. =Buddhist canon= The Dharmaguptakas were said to have had two extra sections in their canon: # Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka # Mantra Pi·π≠aka or DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ Pi·π≠aka In the 4th century MahƒÅyƒÅna abhidharma work Abhidharmasamuccaya, Asa·πÖga refers to the collection which contains the ƒÄgamas as the ≈örƒÅvakapi·π≠aka, and associates it with the ≈õrƒÅvakas and pratyekabuddhas.Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching. 2001. pp. 199-200 Asa·πÖga classifies the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as belonging to the Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka, which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas. =ParamƒÅrtha= ParamƒÅrtha, a 6th-century CE Indian monk from Ujjain, unequivocally associates the Dharmaguptaka school with the MahƒÅyƒÅna, and portrays the Dharmaguptakas as being perhaps the closest to a straightforward MahƒÅyƒÅna sect.Walser, Joseph.

Political party committees are distinct from political action committees, which are formally independent of political parties and subject to different rules. Though their own internal rules differ, the two major political parties (Democrats and Republicans) have essentially parallel sets of committees. (Third parties have varied organizational structures, although several do have national committees officially recognized by the FEC.) National committees The Democratic National Committee, Reform Party National Committee, Green National Committee, Libertarian National Committee, and Republican National Committee are the official central organizations for their respective parties. They have the greatest role in presidential election years when they are responsible for planning the nominating convention and also spend heavily in support of their party's nominee (some of this spending is directly coordinated with the nominee's campaign; the rest is in independent expenditures). The two major parties also have two national Hill committees, controlled by their caucus leadership in each house of Congress, which work specifically to elect members of their own party to Congress. The individual contribution limit to a single national party committee is currently $32,400 per calendar year, but is indexed to inflation. State and local committees State party organizations typically have both federal and non-federal accounts, and money can be transferred between the two under certain circumstances. (A third and more complicated category of money, Levin funds, has been created by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.) The federal limit for individual contributions to state and local party committees is a combined total of $10,000 per year.

At first the two men did not get along behind the scenes, but they decided to team up for business reasons.Guerrero, Eddie. Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story, p. 94. Guerrero, however, was teaming with El Hijo del Santo at the time. Guerrero's brother Mando came up with the idea of Guerrero turning on Santo and aligning himself with Barr as villains. Barr and Guerrero met with AAA's owner Antonio Pe√±a, who gave them the green light on the storyline. The duo was originally known as the American Machine and then La Pareja del Terror, but their name was changed to Los Gringos Locos after the announcers said \\"Those gringos are loco,\\" in regards to the team. Los Gringos feuded primarily with El Hijo del Santo and Octag√≥n. On November 5, 1993, Santo and Octag√≥n defeated them to become the inaugural IWC/AAA World Tag Team Champions. Barr and Guerrero, however, defeated them for the championship in July. Meanwhile, as they continued to team together, Guerrero and Barr began to become good friends. =Becoming a stable= As Los Gringos Locos became more popular in Mexico, AAA's owner Antonio Pe√±a and top star Konnan decided to turn the team into an alliance of several wrestlers. Backstage, both Guerrero and Barr were against the idea of expanding the team, but agreed to it if they could have a say in who was allowed to join the stable. Konnan was the first to join the team, and at the suggestion of Guerrero and Barr, Black Cat was the second. The stable continued to grow to include Madonna's Boyfriend (Louie Spicolli), Chicano Power, and El Misterioso. The team continued to feud with El Hijo del Santo and Octag√≥n, but the rivalry ended in a Hair vs. Mask match at the first lucha pay-per-view in America, When Worlds Collide, which they lost. Barr convinced Antonio Pe√±a that he be included in the match, which was originally supposed to be Guerrero against Santo.Guerrero, Eddie. Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story, p. 101. Barr and Guerrero both received $7,500 for their part in the match.

The northernmost of the three main passes across the Southern Alps, it is higher than the Haast Pass, and slightly lower than Arthur's Pass. State Highway 7 traverses the pass on its route between north Canterbury and the West Coast; it passes through extensive unmodified beech forest. The pass is the saddle between the valleys of the Maruia River to the northwest and the Lewis River to the southeast. The saddle is located close to the small spa of Maruia Springs. The Lewis Pass is named after Henry Lewis who, together with Christopher Maling, was the first European to discover the pass, in April 1860 while working as a surveyor of the Nelson Provincial Survey Department. Before this time the pass was used by the NgƒÅi Tahu MƒÅori of Canterbury to transport Pounamu (greenstone) from the west coast.Darroch Donald, Footprint New Zealand, Footprint Travel Guides, 2007, p499, or Laura Harper, Tony Mudd, Paul Whitfield, Rough guide to New Zealand, Rough Guides, 2002, p683, or The area around Lewis Pass is protected as a national reserve.

The township is the westernmost municipality in New Zealand. Located at the edge of the Fiordland National Park, on the eastern shore of Lake Manapouri, close to its outflow into the Waiau River, tourist boat services are based in the town. Manapouri township is a 20-minute drive from Te Anau via The town is the gateway to both Doubtful Sound and Dusky Sound and the starting point for many local walking tracks. It is a popular tourist destination, particularly during the summer months. The Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station is located on the West Arm of Lake Manapouri, with most of the electricity generated serving the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter (which is announced to close in August 2021). Workers at the power plant are ferried by boat from Manapouri, as there is no road access to the power station.  Facilities  Commercial services include a petrol station/garage, art gallery, cafes, shops, two restaurant and bars as well as overnight hotel, motel and motor camp accommodations. The small Te Anau Airport is situated north of the township and serves both Te Anau and Manapouri. There are several tourist boat excursions based in Manapouri to service the Fiordland Sounds to fishing charters and boat hire. Excursions originating at Pearl Harbour at the southern end of Manapouri township take tourists across Lake Manapouri to view the underground hydroelectric facility, or continue on by bus over Wilmot Pass to boat tours of Doubtful Sound, adding up to a full day trip.  Walkways & Cycleways  Day walks are the Circle Track, the Hope Arm Track, the Shallow Bay portion of the Kepler Track and the Frazers Beach Reserve walkways. Supply Bay Road and the Rainbow Reach area are reasonably cycle-friendly. The Manapouri-Te Anau Cycle trail is currently still under negotiation between the Department of Conservation and the Fiordland Trails Trust.  Kayaking  The eastern end of Lake Manapouri is possibly the best waterway in New Zealand for kayak exploration with 20 islands and many coves, beaches, lagoons, waterfalls, huts, portages and channels with in a days return paddled from Manapouri township.

Biography Exercitatiunculae, 1448 Filelfo was born at Tolentino, in the March of Ancona. He is believed to be a third cousin of Leonardo da Vinci. At the time of his birth, Petrarch and the students of Florence had already begun to exalt the recovery of classic texts and culture. They had created an eager appetite for the antique, had rediscovered many important Roman authors, and had freed Latin scholarship to some extent from the restrictions of earlier periods. Filelfo was destined to carry on their work in the field of Latin literature and as an agent in the still unaccomplished recovery of Greek culture. =In Venice= His earliest studies in grammar, rhetoric and the Latin language were conducted at Padua, where he acquired so great a reputation for learning that in 1417, when he was eighteen, he was invited to teach eloquence and moral philosophy at Venice. According to the custom of that age in Italy, it became his duty to explain the language, and to illustrate the beauties of the principal Latin authors, with Cicero and Virgil considered the chief masters of moral science and of elegant diction. He was admitted to the society of the first scholars and the most eminent nobles. In 1419 he received an appointment from the state, which enabled him to reside as notary and chancellor to the Baile of the Venetians in Constantinople. This appointment was an honour for Filelfo as a man of trust and general ability, and gave him the opportunity of acquiring the most coveted of all possessions at that moment ‚Äî a scholar's knowledge of the Greek language. Immediately after his arrival in Constantinople at the end of 1420, Filelfo placed himself under the tuition of John Chrysoloras, whose name was already well known in Italy as that of his uncle Manuel Chrysoloras, the first Greek to profess the literature of his ancestors in Florence. He assumed his charge of chancellor for the bailo Benedetto Emo (summer 1421 to summer 1423), with diplomatic missions. In late 1421, he accompanied Emo during an embassy to the Ottoman Sultan Murad II, who was the candidate supported by Venice for the succession of the late Sultan Mehmed I. In contrast, the Byzantines supported the candidacy of the pretender Mustafa. This would have been difficult for the pupil of John Chrysoloras. The final victory of Murad II resulted in the siege of Constantinople in spring 1422. It was during the great assault of 22 August 1422 that his professor, mortally ill, dictated to him his will. Nominated executor of this will with the widow of the dead, Manfredina Doria, he was also designated tutor of Chrysoloras' girls. After the completion of his term as chancellor in July 1423, he entered the service of the emperor John VIII Palaeologus who sent him immediately to Sigismond, King of Hungary. Before his departure, his marriage with Theodora, the daughter of John Chrysoloras, was decided, and was concluded when he returned from Hungary after sixteenth months of absence (end October 1424). With a new teacher, Chrysococes, he acquired a thorough knowledge of Greek and formed a large collection of Greek manuscripts. In 1427, he accepted an invitation from the Venetian Republic, and set sail for Italy, intending to resume his professorial career. From this time forward until the date of his death, Filelfo's biography consists of a record of the various towns in which he lectured, the masters whom he served, the books he wrote, the authors he illustrated, the friendships he contracted, and the wars he waged with rival scholars. He was a man of vast physical energy, of inexhaustible mental activity, of quick passions and violent appetites; vain, restless, greedy of gold and pleasure and fame; unable to stay quiet in one place, and perpetually engaged in quarrels with his peers. =In Tuscany= When Filelfo arrived at Venice with his family in 1427, he found the city had almost been emptied by the plague. He therefore moved to Bologna; but the city was too much disturbed with political dissensions to attend to him; so Filelfo crossed the Apennines and settled in Florence. During the week he lectured to large audiences of young and old on the principal Greek and Latin authors, and on Sundays he explained Dante to the people in the Duomo. In addition to these labours of the chair, he found time to translate portions of Aristotle, Plutarch, Xenophon and Lysias from the Greek. Nor was he dead to the claims of society. At first he seems to have lived with the Florentine scholars on tolerably good terms; but he was so arrogant that Cosimo de' Medici's friends were not long able to put up with him. Filelfo hereupon broke out into open and violent animosity; and when Cosimo was exiled by the Albizzi party in 1433, he urged the signoria of Florence to pronounce upon him the sentence of death. On the return of Cosimo to Florence, Filelfo's position in that city was no longer tenable. His life, he asserted, had been already once attempted by a cut- throat in the pay of the Medici; and now he readily accepted an invitation from the state of Siena. In Siena, however, he was not destined to remain more than four years. His fame as a professor had grown great in Italy, and he daily received tempting offers from princes and republics. The most alluring of these, made him by the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti, he decided to accept; and in 1440 he was received with honour by his new master in the capital of Lombardy. =In Lombardy= Satyrae hecatostica : one hundred satirical compositions in hexameters. Filelfo's life at Milan curiously illustrates the multifarious importance of the scholars of that age in Italy. It was his duty to celebrate his princely patrons in panegyrics and epics, to abuse their enemies in libels and invectives, to salute them with encomiastic odes on their birthdays, and to compose poems on their favorite themes. For their courtiers he wrote epithalamial and funeral orations; ambassadors and visitors from foreign states he greeted with the rhetorical lucubrations then so much in vogue. The students of the university he taught in daily lectures, passing in review the weightiest and lightest authors of antiquity, and pouring forth a flood of miscellaneous erudition. Not satisfied with these outlets for his mental energy, Filelfo went on translating from the Greek, and prosecuted a paper warfare with his enemies in Florence. He wrote, moreover, political pamphlets on the great events of Italian history; and when Constantinople was taken by the Turks, he procured the liberation of his wife's mother, Manfredina Doria, by a message addressed in his own name to the sultan. In addition to a fixed stipend of some 700 golden florins yearly, he was continually in receipt of special payments for the orations and poems he produced; so that, had he been a man of frugal habits or of moderate economy, he might have amassed a considerable fortune. As it was, he spent his money as fast as he received it, living in a style of splendour and self-indulgence. In consequence of this prodigality, he was always poor. His letters and his poems abound in demands for money from patrons, some of them couched in language of the lowest adulation, and others savouring of literary brigandage. During the second year of his Milanese residence Filelfo lost his first wife, the Greek Theodora. He soon married again; and this time he chose for his bride a young lady of good Lombard family, called Orsina Osnaga. When she died he took in wedlock for the third time a woman of Lombard birth, Laura Magiolini. On the death of Visconti in 1447, Filelfo, after a short hesitation, transferred his allegiance to Francesco Sforza, husband of Bianca, Visconti's only child, who would become Duke of Milan in 1450. In order to curry favor with this parvenu, he began his ponderous epic, the Sforziad, of which 12,800 lines were written, but which was never published. Some years after the deaths of Francesco and Bianca (1466 and 1468, respectively), Filelfo turned his thoughts towards Rome. He was now an old man of seventy-seven years, honored with the friendship of princes, recognised as the most distinguished of Italian humanists, courted by pontiffs, and decorated with the laurel wreath and the order of knighthood by kings. Crossing the Apennines and passing through Florence, he reached Rome in the second week of 1475. Pope Sixtus IV now ruled in the Vatican, and Filelfo had received an invitation to occupy the chair of rhetoric with good emoluments. At first he was pleased with the city and court of Rome; but his satisfaction turned to discontent, and he gave vent to his ill-humour in a venomous satire on the pope's treasurer, Milliardo Cicala. Sixtus himself soon fell under the ban of his displeasure; and when a year had passed he left Rome never to return. Filelfo reached Milan to find that his wife had died of the plague in his absence, and was already buried. =Return to Tuscany= For some time past he had been desirous of displaying his abilities and adding to his fame in Florence. Years had healed the breach between him and the Medici family; and on the occasion of the Pazzi conspiracy against the life of Lorenzo de' Medici, he had sent violent letters of abuse to his papal patron Sixtus, denouncing his participation in a plot so dangerous to the security of Italy. Lorenzo now invited him to profess Greek at Florence, and so Filelfo went there in 1481. Two weeks after his arrival he succumbed to dysentery, and was buried at the age of eighty-three in the Church of the Annunziata. A complete edition of Filelfo's Greek letters (based on the Codex Trevulzianus) was published for the first time, with French translation, notes and commentaries, by Emile Legrand in 1892 at Paris (C. xii. of Publications de l'√©cole des lang. orient.).

Filippo Maria Visconti, who had become nominal ruler of Pavia in 1402, succeeded his assassinated brother Gian Maria Visconti as Duke of Milan in 1412. They were the sons of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Gian Maria's predecessor, by his second wife, Caterina Visconti. From Filippo's marriage to Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda, Countess of Biandrate and the unhappy widow of Facino Cane‚Äîthe condottiere who had fomented strife between the factions of Filippo's elder brother and his mother, Caterina Visconti, the regent‚ÄîFilippo Maria received a dowry of nearly half a million florins; but when Beatrice took too great an interest in affairs of state, he accused her of adultery and had her beheaded at the castle of Binasco in 1418. Cruel, paranoid and extremely sensitive about his personal ugliness, he was nevertheless a great politician, and by employing such powerful condottieri as Carmagnola, Piccinino--who unsuccessfully led his troops at the Battle of Anghiari, 1440-- and Francesco Sforza, he managed to recover the Lombard portion of his father's duchy. Visconti-Sforza tarot deck. At the death of Giorgio Ordelaffi, lord of Forl√¨, he took advantage of his guardianship of the boy heir, Tebaldo Ordelaffi, to attempt conquests in Romagna (1423), provoking war with Florence, which could not permit his ambitions to go uncontested. Venice, urged on by Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola, decided to intervene on the side of Florence (1425) and the war spread to Lombardy. In March 1426 Carmagnola fomented riots in Brescia, which he had conquered for Visconti just five years previously. After a long campaign, Venice conquered Brescia, extending its mainland possessions to the eastern shores of Lake Garda. Filippo Maria unsuccessfully sought imperial aid but was constrained to accept the peace proposed by Pope Martin V, favoring Venice and Carmagnola. The terms were grudgingly accepted in Milan and by the emperor; but hostilities were resumed at the first pretext by Filippo Maria, leading to the defeat of Maclodio (12 October 1427), followed by a more lasting peace signed at Ferrara with the mediation of Niccol√≤ III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara. The following year the duke married his second wife Marie of Savoy, Duchess of Milan, daughter of Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy, a potent ally. With Visconti's support, Amadeus reigned briefly as antipope Felix V from November 1439 to April 1449. He invited the famous scholar Gasparino Barzizza to establish a school at Milan. Barzizza also served as his court orator. He died in 1447, the last of the Visconti in direct male line, and he was succeeded in the duchy, after the short-lived Ambrosian republic, by Francesco Sforza (1401‚Äì1466), who had married in 1441 Filippo Maria's only heir, his natural daughter Bianca Maria (1425‚Äì1468) by his mistress Agnese del Maino (1401‚Äì1465).

It is well-suited to the implementation of ladder logic, and thus could be used to replace relay systems and programmable logic controllers, also intended for serial data manipulation. The processor supports 16 commands, operating at a frequency of 1 MHz. The MC14500B unit does not include a program counter (PC); instead, a clock signal drives a separate PC chip; therefore the size of supported memory is dependent on the implementation of that chip. It was still in production in 1995. The ICU was conceived by Vern Gregory in the mid-1970s while working as an engineer in a marketing / applications group of Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector in Phoenix, AZ; Brian Dellande originated circuit and sub-routine designs, and co-wrote the manual; Ray DiSilvestro was the bench technician; Terry Malarkey provided management support. In the CMOS Logic Division in Austin, TX (where it was made) Phil Smith was the chip designer; Mike Hadley provided product applications support.

The name correctly suggests that this long river is fast flowing, with numerous rapids. The river flows generally south from the Southern Alps on its journey running through the Skippers Canyon, draining the area between the Richardson Mountains and the Harris Mountains, before flowing into the Kawarau River east of Queenstown. The Edith Cavell bridge crosses the river at Arthurs Point. Tourist operations Shotover River, 2013 Gold mining featured in its early history and it was one of the richest gold-bearing rivers in the world. Beginning in 1862 when gold was first discovered on the river at Arthurs Point, the river has been panned, cradled, sluiced and dredged. Today small-time gold seekers still work the river and two of its tributaries, Moke and Moonlight Creeks, for gold. It is now a popular river for tourism. The river is used for commercial white water rafting trips and jet boating rides which operate out of the nearby tourist resort of Queenstown. There is also a canyon swing site on the river a short distance upriver from Arthurs Point. Three jet boat operators have rights to use the river, as do two rafting companies. Much of the land that surrounds the Shotover River, upstream from Arthurs Point, is now foreign-owned by Robert Lange, the former husband of singer Shania Twain. Naming The river was named Shotover by the first European, William Gilbert Rees to settle on the shores of Lake Wakatipu in 1860. He named it after his business partner, George Gammie's English estate, Shotover Park. The river had been previously called Tummel by two Scottish pioneers named Donald Angus Cameron and Angus Alphonse Macdonald who had passed through the area before Rees arrived. It was also referred to as the Overshot by the early goldminers, but it was the name Shotover that stuck,Gerald Garrick Cunningham - published Otago historian The MƒÅori name for the river is Kimi-ƒÅkau which means looking for the coast which is probably a reference to the area as a route to the West Coast in search of Pounamu. Oxenbridge Tunnel The Oxenbridge Tunnel at Arthurs Point is a tunnel that was part of a failed mining scheme by the Oxenbridge brothers, attempting to divert water from the river to recover gold from the riverbed. It was registered as a Category II Historic Place in 1985, and is used by rafters and kayakers. There is a Department of Conservation track called the Oxenbridge Tunnel Track that goes from the Edith Cavell Bridge alongside the Shotover River to a place near the Oxenbridge Tunnel. Freezing In July 1991 and June 1992 the river froze from bank-to-bank, near Skippers Canyon, and car-tyre sized blocks of ice disrupted tourist activities in July 2007. Also in 2012 large parts of the river froze after a series of cold days which also affected commercial operators.

Niccol√≤ Piccinino (1386 ‚Äì 15 October 1444) was an Italian condottiero. Biography He was born in Perugia, the son of a butcher. He began his military career in the service of Braccio da Montone, who at that time was waging war against Perugia on his own account, and at the death of his chief, shortly followed by that of the latter's son Oddo, Piccinino became leader of Braccio's condotta. After serving for a short period under the Florentine Republic, he went over to Filippo Maria Visconti, duke of Milan (1425), in whose service together with Niccol√≤ Fortebraccio he fought in the Wars in Lombardy against the league of Pope Eugene IV, Venice and Florence. After an outstanding victory over the Venetians at the battle of Delebio (19 November 1432), he defeated the papal forces at Castel Bolognese (1434). When another papal army under Francesco Sforza defeated and killed Fortebraccio at Fiordimonte, Piccinino was left in sole command of the Visconti army, and in a series of campaigns against Sforza he seized a number of cities in Romagna by treachery. Peter Paul Rubens's copy of The Battle of Anghiari by Leonardo da Vinci. Allegedly Niccol√≤ Piccinino is the horseman 2nd from left. In 1438, during the war between Venice and Milan, Piccinino, fighting for the duchy of Milan Filippo Maria Visconti, tried to take the city of Brescia, in Lombardy, but Scaramuccia da Forl√¨, fighting for Venice, intervened successfully to raise the siege. In 1439 Piccinino again fought in Lombardy with varying success against Sforza, who had now entered the Venetian service. Piccinino then induced the duke of Milan to send him to Umbria, where he hoped, like so many other condottieri, to carve out a dominion for himself. He was defeated by Sforza at the Battle of Anghiari (1440), but although a number of his men were taken prisoners they were at once liberated, as was usually done in wars waged by soldiers of fortune. Again the war shifted to Lombardy, and Piccinino, having defeated and surrounded Sforza at Martinengo, demanded of the Visconti the lordship of Piacenza as the price of Sforza's capture. The duke by way of reply concluded a truce with Sforza; but the latter, who, while professing to defend the Papal States, had established his own power in the Marche, aroused the fears of the pope and the king of Naples, as well as of the Visconti, who gave the command of their joint forces to Piccinino. Sforza was driven from the Marche, but defeated Piccinino at Montelauro, and while the latter was preparing for a desperate effort against Sforza he was suddenly recalled to Milan, his army was beaten in his absence, and he died of grief and of his wounds in 1444. Short of stature, lame and in weak health, he was brave to the point of foolhardiness, wonderfully resourceful, and never overwhelmed by defeat. He was cruel and treacherous, and had no aim beyond his own aggrandizement. Piccinino left two sons, Jacopo and Francesco, both condottieri.

The individual floats rise or fall in proportion to their respective density and the density of the surrounding liquid as the temperature changes. It is named after Galileo Galilei because he discovered the principle on which this thermometer is based‚Äîthat the density of a liquid changes in proportion to its temperature. History Although named after the 16th‚Äì17th-century physicist Galileo, the thermometer was not invented by him. (Galileo did invent a thermometer, called Galileo's air thermometer (more accurately termed a thermoscope), in or before 1603.)Aleksandr Khristoforovich Khrgian, Meteorology: a historical survey, Volume 1, Israel Program for Scientific Translations, 1970, p. 25 The instrument now known as a Galileo thermometer was invented by a group of academics and technicians known as the Accademia del Cimento of Florence, who included Galileo's pupil, Torricelli and Torricelli's pupil Viviani.A. Frova & M. Marenzana, Thus spoke Galileo, p.348, accessed on Google Books 2012-06-14, itself based on R. Caverni, Storia del metodo sperimentale in Italia, Vol. 2, Florence, 1895 Details of the thermometer were published in the Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nell'Academia del Cimento sotto la protezione del Serenissimo Principe Leopoldo di Toscana e descritte dal segretario di essa Accademia (1666), the Academy's main publication. The English translation of this work (1684) describes the device ('The Fifth Thermometer') as 'slow and lazy', a description that is reflected in an alternative Italian name for the invention, the termometro lento (slow thermometer).Jos√© Montesinos, Carlos Sol√≠s Santos [eds], Largo campo di filosofare: Eurosymposium Galileo 2001, Fundaci√≥n Canaria Orotava, 2001 The outer vessel was filled with 'rectified spirits of wine' (a concentrated solution of ethanol in water); the weights of the glass bubbles were adjusted by grinding a small amount of glass from the sealed end; and a small air space was left at the top of the main vessel to allow 'for the Liquor to rarefie' [i.e. expand]. The device now called the Galileo thermometer was revived in the modern era by the Natural History Museum, London, which started selling a version in the 1990s.Daily Mirror, 28 January 1994, p. 28 Operation In the Galileo thermometer, the small glass bulbs are partly filled with different-coloured liquids. The composition of these liquids is not important for the functioning of the thermometer; they merely function as fixed weights and their colours are only for decoration. Once the hand-blown bulbs have been sealed, their effective densities are adjusted by means of the metal tags hanging from beneath them. Any expansion due to the temperature change of the coloured liquid and air gap inside the bulbs does not affect the operation of the thermometer, as these materials are sealed inside a glass bulb of fixed size. The clear liquid in which the bulbs are submerged is not water, but some organic compound (such as ethanol) the density of which varies with temperature more than liquid does. Temperature changes affect the density of the outer clear liquid and this causes the bulbs to rise or sink.  Theory of operation  Closeup of bulbs The Galilean thermometer works on the principle of buoyancy. Buoyancy determines whether objects float or sink in a liquid, and is responsible for the fact that even boats made of steel float in water while a solid bar of steel sinks. The only factor that determines whether a large object rises or falls in a particular liquid is the object's density relative to the density of the liquid. If the object is denser than the liquid, it sinks to the bottom, as it is heavier than the liquid it displaces. If it is less dense, it floats on the water, and will be partially submerged until the weight of the displaced liquid becomes equal to the object's weight. Figure 1 Suppose there are two objects, each with a volume of . The mass of water displaced by an object of this size is . The brown object on the left is floating because the mass of water it would displace if completely submerged () is greater than the mass of the object. It floats half submerged because that is the point where the mass of the water displaced () is equal to the mass of the object. The green object on the right has sunk because the mass of water it is displacing () is less than the object's mass (). Figure 2 All objects made of the green material above will sink. In Figure 2, the interior of the green object has been hollowed out. The total mass of the object is now , yet its volume remains the same, so it floats halfway out of the water like the brown object in Figure 1. In the examples above, the liquid in which the objects have been floating is assumed to be water. Water has a density of , which means that the mass of water displaced by any of the above objects when fully submerged, is . Galileo discovered that the density of a liquid is a function of its temperature. This is the key to how the Galileo thermometer works: as the temperature of most liquids increases, their density decreases. Figure 3 Figure 3 shows a hollow object made of the green material. In the left-hand container, the density of the liquid is . Since the object weighs less than the water it displaces, it floats. In the right-hand container, the density of the water is . Since the object weighs more than the mass of the water it displaces, it sinks. This shows that very small changes in the density of the liquid can easily cause an almost-floating object to sink. Figure 4 Figure 4 shows a schematic representation of a Galileo thermometer at two different temperatures. In some models, if there are some bulbs at the top (Figure 4, left) and some at the bottom, but one floating in the gap, then the one floating in the gap (green ) tells the temperature. If there is no bulb in the gap (Figure 4, right) then the average of the values of the bulb above and below the gap gives the approximate temperature. In other models, the lowest floating bulb gives the approximate temperature.How to read a Galilean Thermometer The weight and size of each bulb is adjusted so they do not jam together, either by being at least half the size of the tube diameter to retain their stacking order or, as an alternative, less than half the tube diameter to freely pass each other in the tubes.

For 17 years (1957‚Äì1974), he was editor-in-chief of the Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram and has been a commentator on Arab affairs for more than 50 years.There isn't a target in Afghanistan worth a $1m missile - Mohamed Heikal, the Arab world's foremost political commentator, Guardian, Stephen Moss, October 10, 2001 Heikal articulated the thoughts of President Gamal Abdel Nasser earlier in his career.Chasing the paper trail, Al-Ahram, July 26, 2007 He worked as a ghostwriter for the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and represented the ideology of pan-Arabism.Efraim Karsh, Islamic Imperialism: A History (New Haven, 2007), p. 149-169 Heikal has been a member of the Central Committee of the Arab Socialist Union. He was appointed minister of information in 1970 but resigned from government in 1974 over differences with Anwar Sadat.Robert Dreyfuss, Devil's Game: How the United States helped unleash Fundamentalist Islam (New York: Metropolitan Books, 2005), p. 151. In September 2003, upon reaching the age of 80, Heikal wrote an article in the monthly magazine Weghat Nazar (where he had been writing for some time) that the time has come for an \\"old warrior\\" to put down his pen and take to the sidelines. Heikal stressed that his decision to stop writing did not mean that he would disappear, but rather take to the sidelines to observe more thoroughly. In the article he also recounted a lot of the events that occurred in his life and formed his experience including his first mission as a reporter in the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942, his friendship with Nasser and his relationship with Sadat. In addition he opened his financial records stating the salaries he has received in all the jobs and posts he has been assigned to. In a 2007 audience with British journalist Robert Fisk, Heikal spoke about the situation in Egypt and criticized Egyptian president Mubarak, saying that Mubarak lives in a \\"world of fantasy\\" in Sharm al Sheikh.Mohamed Hasseinein Heikel: The wise man of the Middle East , Independent, Robert Fisk, April 9, 2007 These comments stirred an uproar within Egyptian society, both for and against Heikal. Heikal did not comment on this criticism except later on Al Jazeera, where he said that he stands by what he has said earlier, adding that Mubarak had not entered political life until very late, which means he lacks necessary experience.  Life  Born in Cairo, Egypt, he counted Abdel Nasser among his grandparents. His family were wealthy wheat merchants in the Nile delta. Mohamed the eldest son in his family, which included three other sisters, was trained to manage the business. However he sought a valuable degree course education at the respected American University in Cairo. During the Second World War, the graduate Heikal commenced a career in journalism at the British controlled and funded Egyptian Gazette, which he edited from 1943. The journal's contributors included English writers George Orwell and Lawrence Durrell. Throughout his career he was a literary critic of Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak's military regimes, which he perceived as having departed from Nasser's original nationalist dream. But this attitude was most dramatic during wartime. He covered the First Arab-Israeli War on the establishment of the State of Israel. He was also present in Cairo when Colonel Nasser staged a military coup d'etat in 1952, whom he immediately befriended. Yet his journalism with Al-Aharam as its editor put the regimes under the microscope, gaining a reputation for investigative reporting, and sound authoritative statements. The Washington Post dubbed him \\"the voice of Egypt...window on a secretive regime\\". Heikal frequently travelled cross-desert borders between countries in the Middle East eagerly reporting on the conflicts. Heikal was an unashamed Pro-Arabist during the post-war era when Nasser dreamed of a Pan-Arab republic across the whole region. Between 1957 and 1974 he was the author of a well- regarded Friday column Bi-Saraha which spoke frankly about Nasser's policies at home and abroad, whilst also being critical. He became a member of the Arab Socialist Union Party, briefly acting as foreign minister under Nasser. But his mood changed with the Colonel's successors, whose lurch to the right shook Cairo's post-colonial establishment. After decades of tension and conflict, the Yom Kippur War inspired by Egypt did nothing to dent the burgeoning power of Jewish nationalism in the region. Sadat's decision in the 1970s was momentous: recognition of the Israeli right to occupy Jerusalem, and to the border with Sinai terminating with Port Eilat. The Egyptians agreed to these terms yearning for peace at almost any price. Sadat, a moderate himself, prepared to meet the implacable Cold War enemy for a negotiated settlement. Heikal was among the old Nasserite Cairo elites that opposed any suggestion of a diplomatic rapprochement with the hated enemy. In 1974 he was removed from post by Sadat's office and jailed for treasonous activity. Sadat's assassination was a setback for Arab-Israeli relations, and ushered a period of retrenched reaction to threats posed by military situations to the stability of Egypt, events explored in Autumn of Fury (1980). President Mubarak was more conscious of security, policing and law and order, imposing crackdowns on protests. Abroad Egypt, he continued Sadat's realignment with the West, and particularly American global capitalism that funded the permanence of the Israeli State, Mubarak's new political realism prompted Heikal's move to a fundamentalist opposition to what he interpreted as a return to colonial status quo ante. Joining Al-Jazeera Television in Qatar, Heikal was able to comment on the Gulf War and then ensuing conflicts from a purely Islamic perspective. In 1996 he published an influential publication Secret Channels in which he told the chronological story leading up to the culmination of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993 orchestrated by the West to bring an end to decades of war in Palestine. By the end of his period at Al- Jazeera, he attacked Mubarak in his book Mubarak and His Time calling him \\"inept and corrupt\\". Nonetheless, the advent of a new extremist dawn with the Muslim Brotherhood forced Heikal to awake to the perils of chaos. The compromise position of a US-educated president and more social freedoms in Egypt made Sisi more acceptable to Heikal's nationalistic views. Heikal suffered from kidney disease in his final years, and died aged 92 from renal failure.The Daily Telegraph, Tuesday 23 February 2016, Obituaries [paper only], p.25 Al Jazeera Lecture Series Heikal's lecture series on Al Jazeera furnishes him with a greater platform in the Arab world, broadcasting every Thursday evening. Here he generally discusses information he acquired during his years as a journalist, historian, and a player in the political arena in Egypt's modern history. His lectures gave an overview of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of modern Arab nationalist governments. He has also lectured on the rise of the American Empire and the decline of the previous superpowers. His lectures range from general overviews to intricate details of scenes he witnessed.

In 1990, new management at the station forced Kingsmill and many others to re-apply for their jobs. Kingsmill failed to regain his producer position, but landed a presenter position instead. Since then, he has hosted shows that involve an in-depth knowledge of the current state of the alternative music scene, at both a local and international level. These shows have included The J-Files (1995‚Äì2003) and the Australian Music Show (1993‚Äì2003). In 1994, he began hosting triple j's New Releases show. Two years later, this evolved into 1996, a show dedicated to the latest release music from around the world. (The show has changed its name each year, to reflect the current year.) His 2010 show was voted Best Radio Show of the Year by SPA (Street Press Australia) readers nationwide. In 2003, Kingsmill was promoted to the position of Music Director after the retirement of Arnold Frolows, who had been in the position since Double Jay's inception in 1975. As a result, he cut back his on-air shifts and currently presents only the new music show on a Sunday night. In May 2012, Kingsmill was voted International Music Director of the year at the Worldwide Radio Summit in Los Angeles. Kingsmill is the author of two books; triple j's Internet Music Guide (co-written with Stuart Coupe in 1998) and The J-Files Compendium (2002). The latter is a collection of his many music interviews, songlists, quizzes and music trivia sourced from The J-Files. Kingsmill appeared in the Radiohead documentary Meeting People Is Easy (1998). When Roy and HG left triple j for Triple M, Kingsmill became the station's longest serving presenter. In 2009, he presented the triple j Hottest 100 of All Time on Rage with Zan Rowe. He also hosted an Australian music-themed program on Rage in 1998. In 2009, Kingsmill was executive producer of Before Too Long: Triple J's Tribute to Paul Kelly. The show ran over two nights at the Forum Theatre in Melbourne in November with various artists performing tracks by Paul Kelly, which was recorded for a 3√ó CD of the same name released in February 2010. It featured John Butler, Missy Higgins, Megan Washington, Dan Sultan, Bob Evans, Paul Dempsey, Katy Steele, Adalita, Clare Bowditch, Dan Kelly, Ozi Batla and Jae Laffer. Along with the show's music director, Ash Naylor, Kingsmill accepted the ARIA Award in 2010 for Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album. Sections of Kingsmill's 1999 radio interview with the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith were used in the 2014 documentary of Elliot's life, Heaven Adores You http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/media/s2371161.htmHeaven Adores You (2014) Director:Nickolas Rossi In 2017, Kingsmill became Group Music Director, coordinating the team of music directors for four ABC national networks ‚Äì triple j, triple j Unearthed, Double J and ABC Local Radio.

(c. 1382 ‚Äì 5 May 1432), was an Italian condottiero. Francesco Bussone  Life  Bussone was born at Carmagnola, near Turin, in a humble peasant family. He began his military career when twelve years old under Facino Cane, a condottiero then in the service of the Marquess of Montferrat and later Gian Galeazzo Visconti, duke of Milan. On the death of Cane, the duchy was divided among his captains; but Gian Galeazzo's son and heir, Filippo Maria, determined to reconquer it by force of arms. Facino Cane being dead, Visconti applied to Carmagnola, then in his thirtieth year, and gave him command of the army. Carmagnola's success was astonishingly rapid: he subdued Bergamo, Brescia, Parma, Genoa, and other cities. Soon the whole duchy was brought once more under Visconti's sway. But Filippo Maria, although he rewarded Carmagnola generously, feared that he might become a danger to himself, and instead of giving him further military commands made him governor of Genoa. Carmagnola felt greatly aggrieved, and failing to obtain a personal interview with the duke, threw up his commission and offered his services to the Venetians (1425). He was well received in Venice, for the republic was beginning to fear the ambitions of the Visconti, and the new doge, Francesco Foscari, was anxious to join the Florentines and go to war with Milan. Carmagnola himself represented the duke's forces as much less numerous than they were supposed to be, and said that the moment was an opportune one to attack him. These arguments, combined with the doge's warlike temper, prevailed; Carmagnola was made captain-general of St. Mark in 1426, and war was declared. But while the republic was desirous of rapid and conclusive operations, it was to the interest of Carmagnola, as indeed to all other soldiers of fortune, to make the operations last as long as possible, to avoid decisive operations, and to liberate all prisoners quickly. Consequently, the campaign dragged on interminably, some battles were won and others lost, truces and peace treaties were made only to be broken, and no definite result was achieved. The capture of the Count of Carmagnola in an old print. Carmagnola's most important success was the battle of Maclodio (1427), but he did not follow it up. The republic, impatient of his dilatoriness, raised his emoluments and promised him immense fiefs including the lordship of Milan, so as to increase his ardour, but in vain. At the same time Carmagnola was perpetually receiving messengers from Visconti, who offered him great rewards if he would abandon the Venetians. The general trifled with his past as with his present employers, believing in his foolish vanity that he held the fate of both in his hand. But the Venetians were dangerous masters to trifle with, and when they at last lost all patience, the Council of Ten determined to bring him to justice. Summoned to Venice to discuss future operations on 29 March 1432, he came without suspicion. On his arrival at the ducal palace he was seized, imprisoned and brought to trial for treason against the republic. Although the doge befriended him he was condemned to death and beheaded on 5 May. A man of ability, his great mistake was that he failed to see that he could not do with a solvent and strong government what he could with bankrupt tyrants without military resources, and that the astute Visconti meant to ruin him for his abandonment. In 1416, Carmagnola ordered for military reasons the destruction of the Trezzo Bridge, the largest single arch bridge in the medieval world. His daughter Luchina was married to the condottiero Luigi dal Verme. He met with Giovanni Fontana.  Culture  Alessandro Manzoni made Francesco Bussone the subject of a poetical drama, Il Conte di Carmagnola (1820). An opera Le Comte de Carmagnola with book by Eug√®ne Scribe and music by Ambroise Thomas was produced at the Paris Op√©ra on 19 April 1841. A soprano showpiece from the opera has been recorded by Elizabeth Vidal on Talent DOM 2910 77. Carmagnola is a character in Rafael Sabatini's Bellarion, though he is portrayed as swaggering and self-important, and becomes a minor antagonist. A sculpted porphyry head widely thought to represent Justinian, on the exterior facade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice, has been nicknamed Carmagnola following Bussone's beheading.

Ed. Hugh Brigstocke. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 29 Mar. 2016 Life Spinello Aretino was the son of a Florentine named Luca. His family was active in the goldsmith trade and had taken refuge in Arezzo in 1310 when the rest of the Ghibelline party was exiled from Florence. His actual name was Spinello Di Luca Spinelli but he was called 'Aretino' which means 'from Arezzo'. Salome In the past it was believed that Spinello was a pupil of Jacopo del Casentino, a follower of Giotto. However, this is no longer accepted by art historians.Frank Dabell and Stephen K. Scher. \\"Spinelli.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 16 June 2016 Spinello's style was a sort of link between the school of Giotto and that of Siena. In the early part of his life he worked in Florence as an assistant to his master Jacopo while painting frescoes in the church of the Carmine and in Santa Maria Novella. Between 1360 and 1384 he was occupied in painting many frescoes in and near Arezzo, almost all of which have now perished. After the sack of Arezzo in 1384 Spinello returned to Florence, and in 1387-1388 with some assistants covered the walls and vault of the sacristy of San Miniato of Florence with a series of frescoes, the chief of which represent scenes from the life of Saint Benedict. These still exist, though in a sadly restored condition; they are very Giotto-like in composition, but have some of the Siena decorative brilliance of color. Battle of Punta San Salvatore In 1391-1392 Spinello was painting six frescoes, which still remain on the south wall of the Pisan Campo Santo, representing miracles of St. Potitus and St. Ephesus. For these he received 270 gold florins. Among his later works the chief are the very fine series of frescoes painted in 1407-1408 on the walls and vault of a chapel in the municipal buildings of Siena; these also have suffered much from repainting, but still are the finest of Spinello's existing frescoes. Frescoes in Sala di Balia of the Palazzo Pubblico represent the war of Frederick Barbarossa against the Pope Alexander III. Spinello died in Arezzo about 1410. Work Spinello's frescoes are all strong and highly decorative works, drawn with much spirit, and are very superior in style to his panel pictures, many of which appear to be mere bottega productions. The academy of Florence possesses a panel of the Madonna and Saints, which is chiefly interesting for its signature Hoc opus pinxit Spinellus Luce Aritio D.I.A. (1391). The easel pictures which are to be found in the various galleries of Europe give little or no notion of Spinello's power as a painter. On of the highlights of his late career is a cycle of frescos on the life of Pope Alexander III made for the Sala di Balia of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena.

On the death of Nero, he attached himself to Galba, who appointed him to the command of Legio IV Macedonica at Mogontiacum in Germania Superior (Upper Germany). Having been prosecuted for embezzling public money, Caecina went over to Vitellius, who sent him with a large army into Italy. Caecina crossed the Alps, but was defeated near Cremona by Suetonius Paulinus, the chief general of Otho. Subsequently, in conjunction with Fabius Valens, Caecina defeated Otho at the decisive battle of Bedriacum (Betriacum). The incapacity of Vitellius tempted Vespasian to take up arms against him. Caecina, who had been entrusted with the repression of the revolt, turned traitor, and tried to persuade his army to go over to Vespasian, but was thrown into chains by the soldiers. After the overthrow of Vitellius, he was released, and taken into favor by the new emperor. But he could not remain loyal to anyone. In 79 he was implicated, along with Eprius Marcellus, in a conspiracy against Vespasian, and was put to death by order of Titus.

The Hungarian nobility consisted of a privileged group of people, most of whom owned landed property, in the Kingdom of Hungary. Initially, a diverse category of people were mentioned as noblemen, but from the late 12th century only the high-ranking royal officials were regarded as noble. Most aristocrats claimed a late-9th- century Magyar leader for their ancestor; others were descended from foreign knights; and local Slavic chiefs were also integrated in the nobility. Less illustrious individuals, known as castle warriors, also held landed property and served in the royal army. Most privileged laymen called themselves royal servants to emphasize their direct contact to the monarchs from the 1170s. The Golden Bull of 1222 enacted their liberties, especially their tax-exemption and the limitation of their military obligations. From the 1220s, the royal servants were associated with the nobility and the highest-ranking officials were known as barons of the realm. Only those who owned allodslands free of obligationswere regarded true noblemen, but other privileged groups of landowners, known as conditional nobles, also existed. Simon of K√©za was the first to claim, in the 1280s, that the noblemen held real authority in the kingdom. The counties developed into institutions of noble autonomy and the nobles' delegates attended the Diets (or parliaments). The wealthiest barons built stone castles which enabled them to control vast territories, but royal authority was restored in the early 14th century. Louis I of Hungary introduced an entail system and enacted the principle of \\"one and the selfsame liberty\\" of all noblemen. Actually, legal distinctions between true noblemen and conditional nobles prevailed, and the most powerful nobles employed lesser noblemen as their familiares (or retainers). According to customary law, only males inherited noble estates, but the kings could \\"promote a daughter to a son\\", authorizing her to inherit her father's lands. Noblewomen who had married a commoner could also claim their inheritancethe daughters' quarterin land. The monarchs granted hereditary titles and the poorest nobles lost their tax-exemption from the middle of the 15th century, but the Tripartituma frequently cited compilation of customary lawmaintained the notion of all noblemen's equality. In the early modern period, Hungary was divided into three partsRoyal Hungary, Transylvania and Ottoman Hungarydue to the expansion of the Ottoman Empire in the 1570s. The princes of Transylvania supported the noblemen's fight against the Habsburg kings in Royal Hungary, but they prevented the Transylvanian noblemen from challenging their authority. Ennoblement of whole groups of people was not unusual in the 17th century. After the Diet was divided into two chambers in Royal Hungary in 1608, noblemen with a hereditary title had a seat in the Upper House, other nobles sent delegates to the Lower House. Most parts of medieval Hungary were integrated in the Habsburg Monarchy in the 1690s. The monarchs confirmed the nobles' privileges several times, but their attempts to strengthen royal authority regularly brought them into conflicts with the nobility, who made up about 4,6% of the society. Reformist noblemen demanded the abolition of noble privileges from the 1790s, but their program was enacted only during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Most noblemen lost their estates after the emancipation of their serfs, but the aristocrats preserved their distinguished social status. State administration employed thousands of impoverished noblemen in Austria-Hungary. Prominent (mainly Jewish) bankers and industrialists were awarded with nobility, but their social status remained inferior to traditional aristocrats. Noble titles were abolished only in 1947, months after Hungary was proclaimed a republic. Origins seven Hungarian chiefs depicted in the Illuminated Chronicle The Magyars (or Hungarians) dwelled in the Pontic steppes when they first appeared in the written sources in the mid-9th century. Muslim merchants described them as wealthy nomadic warriors, but they also noticed that the Magyars had extensive arable lands. Masses of Magyars crossed the Carpathian Mountains after the Pechenegs invaded their lands in 894 or 895. They settled in the lowlands along the Middle Danube, annihilated Moravia and defeated the Bavarians in the 900s. Slovak historians write, at least three Hungarian noble kindredsThey refer to the Hont-P√°zm√°ny, Miskolc and Bog√°t-Radv√°ny clans. were descended from Moravian aristocrats. Historians who say that the Vlachs (or Romanians) were already present in the Carpathian Basin in the late 9th century propose that the Vlach knezes (or chieftains) also survived the Hungarian Conquest. Neither of the two continuity theories is universally accepted. Constantine Porphyrogenitus recorded around 950 that the Hungarians were organized into tribes and each had its own \\"prince\\". The tribal leaders most probably bore the title √∫r, as it is suggested by Hungarian termsorsz√°g (now \\"realm\\") and uralkodni (\\"to rule\\")deriving from this noun. Porphyrogenitus noted that the Magyars spoke both Hungarian and \\"the tongue of the Chazars\\",Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio (ch. 39), p. 175. showing that at least their leaders were bilingual. Archaeological research revealed that most settlements comprised small pit-houses and log cabins in the 10th century, but literary sources mentioned that tents were still in use in the 12th century. No archeological finds evidence fortresses in the Carpathian Basin in the 10th century, but fortresses were also rare in Western Europe during the same period. A larger log cabinmeasuring which was built on a foundation of stones in Borsod was tentatively identified as the local leader's abode. More than a 1,000 graves yielding sabres, arrow-heads and bones of horses show that mounted warriors formed a significant group in the 10th century. The highest- ranking Hungarians were buried either in large cemeteries (where hundreds of graves of men buried without weapons surrounded their burial places), or in small cemeteries with 25‚Äì30 graves. The wealthy warriors' burial sites yielded richly decorated horse harness, and sabretaches ornamented with precious metal plaques. Rich women's graves contained their braid ornaments and rings made of silver or gold and decorated with precious stones. The most widespread decorative motifs which can be regarded as tribal totemsthe griffin, wolf and hindwere rarely applied in Hungarian heraldry in the following centuries. Defeats during the Hungarian invasions of Europe and clashes with the paramount rulers from the √Årp√°d dynasty decimated the leading families by the end of the 10th century. The Gesta Hungarorum, which was written around 1200, claimed that dozens of noble kindreds flourishing in the late 12th centuryThe B√°r-Kal√°n, Cs√°k, K√°n, L√°d and Szemere kindreds regarded themselves as descendant of one the legendary 7 leaders of the Hungarian Conquest. had been descended from tribal leaders, but most modern scholars do not regard this list as a reliable source. Middle Ages =Development= Szabolcs Stephen I, who was crowned the first king of Hungary in 1000 or 1001, defeated the last resisting tribal chieftains. Earthen forts were built in the entire kingdom and most of them developed into centers of royal administration. About 30 administrative units, known as counties, were established before 1040; more than 40 new counties were organized during the next centuries. Each county was headed by a royal official, the isp√°n, whose office was not hereditary. The royal court provided further career opportunities. Actually, as Martyn Rady noted, the \\"royal household was the greatest provider of largesse in the kingdom\\" where the royal family owned more than two-thirds of all lands. The palatinethe head of the royal householdwas the highest-ranking royal official. The kings appointed their officials from among the members of about 110 aristocratic kindreds. These aristocrats were descended either from native (that is, Magyar, Kabar, Pecheneg or Slavic) chiefs, or from foreign knights who had migrated to the country in the 11th and 12th centuries. The foreign knights had been trained in the Western European art of war, which contributed to the development of heavy cavalry. Their descendants were labelled as newcomers for centuries, but intermarriages between natives and newcomers were not rare, which enabled their integration. The monarchs pursued an expansionist policy from the late 11th century. Ladislaus I seized Slavoniathe plains between the river Drava and the Dinaric Alpsin the 1090s. His successor, Coloman, was crowned king of Croatia in 1102. Both realms retained their own customs and Hungarians rarely received land grants in Croatia. According to customary law, Croatians could not be obliged to cross the river Drava to fight in the royal army at their own expenses. Hunt, an ancestor of the Hont-P√°zm√°ny kindred, depicted in the Chronicon Pictum The earliest laws authorized the landowners to freely dispose of their private estates, but customary law prescribed that inherited lands could only be alienated with the consent of the owner's kinsmen who could inherit them. From the early 12th century, only family lands traceable back to a grant made by Stephen I could be inherited by the deceased owner's distant relatives; other estates escheated to the Crown if their owner did not have offspring and brothers. Aristocratic families held their inherited domains in common for generations before the 13th century. Thereafter the division of inherited property became the standard practice. Even families descending from wealthy kindreds could impoverish through the regular divisions of their estates. The basic unit of estate organization was mentioned as praedium or allodium in medieval documents. A praedium was a piece of land (either a whole village, or only a part of it) with well-marked borders. Most wealthy landowners' domains consisted of scattered praedia, located in several villages. Due to the scarcity of documentary evidence, the size of the private estates cannot be determined. The descendants of Otto Gy≈ër remained wealthy landowners even after he had donated 360 households to the newly established Zselicszentjakab Abbey in 1061. The establishment of monasteries by wealthy individuals was common. Such proprietary monasteries served as burial places for their founders and the founders' descendants, who were regarded the co-owners, or from the 13th century, co-patrons, of the monastery. Wolf identifies the small motte forts, built on artificial mounds and protected by a ditch and a palisade, that appeared in the 12th century as the centers of private estates. A part of the praedium was cultivated by unfree peasants, but other plots were hired out in return for in-kind taxes. The term \\"noble\\" was rarely used and poorly defined before the 13th century: it could refer to a courtier, a landowner with judicial powers, or even to a common warrior. The existence of a diverse group of warriors, who were subjected to the monarch, royal officials or prelates is well documented. The castle warriors, who were exempted of taxation, held hereditary landed property around the royal castles. Light-armored horsemen, known as l√∂v≈ës (or archers), and armed castle folk, mentioned as ≈ërs (or guards), defended the gyep≈±s (or borderlands). =Golden Bulls= The Golden Bull of 1222 √Årva Castle (now Oravsk√Ω hrad in Slovakia), one of the royal fortresses built after the Mongol invasion of Hungary Only the court dignitaries and isp√°ns were mentioned as noblemen in official documents from the end of the 12th century. The aristocrats had adopted most elements of chivalric culture. They regularly named their children after Paris of Troy, Hector, Tristan, Lancelot and other heroes of Western European chivalric romances. The first tournaments were held around the same time. The regular alienation of royal estates is well-documented from the 1170s. The monarchs also granted immunities, exempting the grantee's estates of the jurisdiction of the isp√°ns, or even renouncing royal revenues that had been collected there. B√©la III was the first Hungarian monarch to give away a whole county to a nobleman: he granted Modrus in Croatia to Bartholomew of Krk in 1193, stipulating that Bartholomew was to equip warriors for the royal army. B√©la's son, Andrew II, decided to \\"alter the conditions\\" of his realm and to \\"distribute castles, counties, lands and other revenues\\" to his officials, as he narrated in a diploma in 1217. Instead of granting the estates in fief, with an obligation to render future services, he gave them as allods, in reward for the grantee's previous acts. The great officers who were the principal beneficiaries of his grants were mentioned as barons of the realm from the late 1210s. Donations to such a large scale accelerated the development of a wealthy group of landowners, most descending from high- ranking kindreds. Some wealthy landownersAndronicus Aba built a castle at F√ºz√©r, and the castle at Kabold (now Kobersdorf in Austria) was erected by Pousa Sz√°k. could afford to build stone castles in the 1220s. Closely related aristocrats were distinguished from other lineages through a reference to their (actual or presumed) common ancestor with the words de genere (\\"from the kindred\\"). Families descending from the same kindred adopted similar insignia.The families from the Aba clan had an eagle on their coat-of-arms, and the Cs√°ks adopted the lion. The author of the Gesta Hungarorum fabricated genealogies for them and emphasized that they could never be excluded from \\"the honor of the realm\\",Anonymus, Notary of King B√©la: The Deeds of the Hungarians (ch. 6.), p. 19. that is from state administration. The new owners of the alienated royal estates wanted to subject the freemen, castle warriors and other privileged groups of people living in or around their domains. The threatened groups wanted to achieve the confirmation of their status as royal servants, emphasizing that they were only to serve the king. B√©la III issued the first extant royal charter about the grant of this rank to a castle warrior. The royal servants' privileges were enacted in Andrew II's Golden Bull of 1222. They were exempt from taxation; they were to fight in the royal army without a proper compensation only if enemy forces invaded the kingdom; their cases could only be judged by the monarch or the palatine; and their arrest without a verdict was prohibited. According to the Golden Bull, only royal servants who died without a son could freely will their estates, but even in this case, their daughters were entitled to the daughters' quarter (that is one-quarter of their possessions). The final article of the Golden Bull authorized the bishops, barons and other nobles to resist the monarch if he ignored its provisions. Most provisions of te Golden Bull were first confirmed in 1231. The clear definition of the royal servants' liberties distinguished them from all other privileged groups whose military obligations remained theoretically unlimited. From the 1220s, the royal servants were regularly called noblemen and started to develop their own corporate institutions at the counties' level. In 1232, the royal servants of Zala County asked Andrew II to authorize them \\"to judge and do justice\\", stating that the county had slipped into anarchy. The king granted their request and Bartholomew, Bishop of Veszpr√©m, sued one Ban Oguz for properties before their community. The \\"community of the royal servants of Zala\\" was regarded a juridical person with its own seal. Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century The first Mongol invasion of Hungary proved the importance of well-fortified places and heavy-armored cavalry in 1241 and 1242. During the following decades, B√©la IV of Hungary gave away large parcels of the royal demesne, expecting that the new owners would build stone castles there. B√©la's burdensome castle-building program was unpopular, but he achieved his aim: almost 70 castles were built or reconstructed during his reign. More than half of the new or reconstructed castles was located in noblemen's domains. Most new castles were erected on rocky peaks, mainly along the western and northern borderlands. The spread of stone castles made profound changes in the structure of landholding, because castles could not be maintained without proper income. Lands and villages were legally attached to each castle and castles were thereafter always alienated and inherited along with these \\"appurtenances\\". The royal servants were legally identified as nobles in 1267. In this year, \\"the nobles of all Hungary, called royal servants\\" persuaded B√©la IV and his son, Stephen, to hold an assembly and confirm their collective privileges. Other groups of land-holding warriors could also be called nobles, but they were always distinguished from the true noblemen. The Vlach noble knezes who had landed property in the Banate of Severin were obliged to fight in the army of the ban (or royal governor). Most warriors known as the noble sons of servants were descended from freemen or liberated serfs who received estates from B√©la IV in Upper Hungary on the condition that they were to jointly equip a fixed number of knights. The nobles of the Church formed the armed retinue of the wealthiest prelates. The nobles of Turopolje in Slavonia were required to provide food and fooder to high-ranking royal officials. The Sz√©kelys and Saxons firmly protected their communal liberties which prevented their leaders from exercise noble privileges in the Sz√©kely and Saxon territories in Transylvania. Sz√©kelys and Saxons could only enjoy the liberties of noblemen if they held estates outside the lands of the two privileged communities. Most noble families failed to adopt a strategy to avoid the division of their inherited estates into dwarf-holdings through generations. Daughters could only demand the cash equivalent of the quarter of their father's estates, but younger sons rarely remained unmarried. Impoverished noblemen had little chance to receive land grants from the kings, because they were unable to participate in the monarchs' military campaigns, but commoners who bravely fought in the royal army were regularly ennobled. =Self-government and oligarchs= L√°nzs√©r Castle (now Burgruine Landsee in Austria), built before 1300 Historian Erik F√ºgedi noted that \\"castle bred castle\\" in the second half of the 13th century: if a landowner erected a fortress, his neighbors were also to build one to defend their own estates. Between 1271 and 1320, at least 155 new fortresses were built by noblemen or prelates, and only about a dozen castles were erected on royal domains. Most castles consisted of a tower, surrounded by a fortified courtyard, but the tower could also be built into the walls. Noblemen who could not erect fortresses were occasionally forced to abandon their inherited estates or seek the protection of more powerful lords, even through renouncing their liberties.According to a 15th-century land-register, many ecclesiastic nobles in the Bishopric of Veszpr√©m were descended from true noblemen who had sought the bishops' protection. The lords of the castles had to hire a professional staff for the defence of the castle and the management of its appurtenances. They primarily employed nobles who held nearby estates, which gave rise to the development of a new institution, known as familiaritas. A familiaris was a nobleman who entered into the service of a wealthier landowner in exchange for a fixed salary or a portion of revenue, or rarely for the ownership or usufruct of a piece of land. Unlike a conditional noble, a familiaris remained in theory an independent landholder, only subjected to the monarch. The monarchs took an oath at their coronation, which included a promise to respect the noblemen's liberties from the 1270s. The counties gradually transformed into an institution of the noblemen's local autonomy. Noblemen regularly discussed local matters at the general assemblies of the counties. The sedria (or law courts of the counties) became important elements of the administration of justice. They were headed by the isp√°ns or their deputies, but they consisted of four (in Slavonia and Transylvania, two) elected local noblemen, known as judges of the nobles. Hungary fell into a state of anarchy because of the minority of Ladislaus IV in the early 1270s. To restore public order, the prelates convoked the barons and the delegates of the noblemen and Cumans to a general assembly near Pest in 1277. This first Diet (or parliament) declared the monarch to be of age. In the early 1280s, Simon of K√©za associated the Hungarian nation with the nobility in his Deeds of the Hungarians, emphasizing that the community of noblemen held real authority. The barons took advantage of the weakening of royal authority and seized large contiguous territories. The monarchs could not appoint and dismiss their officials at will any more. The most powerful baronsknown as oligarchs in modern historiographyappropriated royal prerogatives, combining private lordship with their administrative powers. When Andrew III, the last male member of the √Årp√°d dynasty, died in 1301, about a dozen lordsThe most powerful oligarch, Matthew Cs√°k, dominated more than a dozen counties in northwestern Hungary; Ladislaus K√°n was the actual ruler of Translyvnia; and Paul ≈†ubiƒá ruled Croatia and Dalmatia. held sway over most parts of the kingdom. =Age of the Angevins= Ladislaus IV's great-nephew, Charles I, who was a scion of the Capetian House of Anjou, restored royal power in the 1310s and 1320s. He captured the oligarchs' castles, which again secured the preponderance of the royal demesne. He refuted to confirm the Golden Bull in 1318 and claimed that noblemen had to fight in his army at their own expenses. He ignored customary law and regularly \\"promoted a daughter to a son\\", granting her the right to inherit her father's estates. He reorganized the royal household, appointing pages and knights to form his permanent retinue. He established the Order of Saint George, which was the first chivalric order in Europe. He was the first Hungarian monarch to grant coats of arms (or rather crests) to his subjects. Charles based royal administration on honors (or office fiefs), distributing most counties and royal castles among his highest-ranking officials. These \\"baronies\\", as Matteo Villani recorded it around 1350, were \\"neither hereditary nor lifelong\\", but Charles rarely dismissed his most trusted barons. Each baron was required to hold his own banderium (or armed retinue), distinguished by his own banner. Insignia of the Order of Saint George In 1351, Charles's son and successor, Louis I confirmed all provisions of the Golden Bull, save the one that authorized childless noblemen to freely will their estates. Instead, he introduced an entail system, prescribing that childless noblemen's landed property \\"should descend to their brothers, cousins and kinsmen\\". The concept of aviticitas also protected the Crown's interests: only kins within the third degree could inherit a nobleman's property and noblemen who had only more distant relatives could not dispose of their property without the king's consent. Louis I emphasized that all noblemen enjoyed \\"one and the selfsame liberty\\" in his realms and secured all privileges that nobles owned in Hungary proper to their Slavonian and Transylvanian peers. He rewarded dozens of Vlach knezes and voivodes with true nobility for military merits. The vast majority of the noble sons of servants achieved the status of true noblemen without a formal royal act, because the memory of their conditional landholding fell into oblivion. Most of them preferred Slavic names even in the 14th century, showing that they spoke the local Slavic vernacular. Other groups of conditional nobles remained distinguished from true noblemen. They developed their own institutions of self-government, known as seats or districts. Louis decreed that only Catholic noblemen and knezes could hold landed property in the district of Kar√°nsebes (now Caransebe»ô in Romania) in 1366, but Orthodox landowners were not forced to convert to Catholicism in other territories of the kingdom. Even the Catholic bishop of V√°rad (now Oradea in Romania) authorized his Vlach voivodes to employ Orthodox priests. The king granted the district of Fogaras (around present-day FƒÉgƒÉra»ô in Romania) to Vladislav I of Wallachia in fief in 1366. In his new duchy, Vladislaus I donated estates to Wallachian boyars; their legal status was similar to the position of the knezes in other regions of Hungary. Royal charters customarily identified noblemen and landowners from the second half of the 14th century. A man who lived in his own house on his own estates was described as living \\"in the way of nobles\\", in contrast with those who did not own landed property and lived \\"in the way of peasants\\". A verdict of 1346 declared that a noble woman who was given in marriage to a commoner should receive her inheritance \\"in the form of an estate in order to preserve the nobility of the descendants born of the ignoble marriage\\". Her husband was also regarded noblemena noble by his wifeaccording to the local customs of certain counties. The peasants' legal position had been standardized in almost the entire kingdom by the 1350s. The iobagiones (or free peasant tenants) were to pay seigneurial taxes, but were rarely obliged to perform labour service. In 1351, the king ordered that the nintha tax payable to the landownerswas to be collected from all iobagiones, thus preventing landowners from offering lower taxes to persuade tenants to move from other lords' lands to their estates. In 1328, all landowners were authorized to administer justice on their estates \\"in all cases except cases of theft, robbery, assault or arson\\". The kings started to grant noblemen the right to execute or mutilate criminals who were captured in their estates. The most influential noblemen's estates were also exempted of the jurisdiction of the sedria. =Emerging Estates= Royal power quickly declined after Louis I died in 1382. His son-in-law, Sigismund of Luxembourg, entered into a formal league with the aristocrats who had elected him king in early 1387. He had to give away more than the half of the 150 royal castles to his supporters before he could strengthen his authority in the early 15th century. His most favorites were foreigners,The Styrian Hermann of Celje became the greatest landowner in Slavonia; the Pole Stibor of Stiboricz held 9 castles and 140 villages in northeastern Hungary. but old Hungarian familiesThe B√°thory, Per√©nyi and Rozgonyi families were among the native beneficiaries of Sigismund's grants. also took advantage of his magnanimity. The wealthiest noblemen, known as magnates, built comfortable castles in the countryside which became important centers of social life. These fortified manor houses always contained a hall for representative purposes and a private chapel. Sigismund regularly invited the magnates to the royal council even if they did not hold higher offices. He founded a new chivalric order, the Order of the Dragon, in 1408 to award his most loyal supporters. √öjlakis' castle at V√°rpalota The expansion of the Ottoman Empire reached the southern frontiers in the 1390s. A large anti-Ottoman crusade ended with a catastrophic defeat near Nicopolis in 1396. Next year, Sigismund held a Diet in Temesv√°r (now Timi»ôoara in Romania) to strengthen the defence system. He confirmed the Golden Bull, but without the two provisions that limited the noblemen's military obligations and established their right to resist the monarchs. The Diet obliged all landowners to equip one archer for 20 peasant plots on their domains to serve in the royal army. Sigismund granted large estates to neighboring Orthodox rulers in HungaryMircea I of Wallachia was awarded with Fogaras; Stefan Lazareviƒá, Despot of Serbia, received more than a dozen of castles. to secure their alliance. They established Basilite monasteries on their estates. Sigismund's son-in-law, Albert of Habsburg, was elected king in early 1438, but only after he promised to always make important decisions with the consent of the royal council. After he died in 1439, a civil war broke out between the partisans of his son, Ladislaus the Posthumous, and the supporters of Vladislaus III of Poland. Ladislaus the Posthumous was crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary, but the Diet proclaimed the coronation invalid. Vladislaus died fighting against the Ottomans during the Crusade of Varna in 1444 and the Diet elected seven captains in chief to administer the kingdom. The talented military commander, John Hunyadi, was elected the sole regent in 1446. The Diet developed from a consultative body into an important institution of law making in the 1440s. The magnates were always invited to attend it in person. Lesser noblemen were also entitled to personally attend the Diet, but they were in most cases represented by delegates. The noble delegates were almost always the familiares of the magnates. =Birth of titled nobility and the Tripartitum= Lawrence √öjlaki in √öjlak (now Ilok in Croatia) Hunyadi was the first noble to receive a hereditary title from a Hungarian monarch. Ladislaus the Posthumous granted him the Saxon district of Bistritz (now Bistri»õa in Romania) with the title perpetual count in 1453. Hunyadi's son, Matthias Corvinus, who was elected king in 1458, rewarded further noblemen with the same title. F√ºgedi states, 16 December 1487 was the \\"birthday of the estate of magnates in Hungary\\", because an armistice signed on this day listed 23 Hungarian \\"natural barons\\", contrasting them with the high officers of state, who were mentioned as \\"barons of office\\". Corvinus' successor, Vladislaus II, and Vladislaus' son, Louis II, started to formally reward important persons of their government with the hereditary title of baron. Differences of the nobles' wealth increased in the second half of the 15th century. About 30 families owned more than a quarter of the territory of the kingdom when Corvinus died in 1490. Average magnates held about 50 villages, but the regular division of inherited landed property could cause the impoverishment of aristocratic families.Stephen B√°nffy of Losonc held 68 villages in 1459, but the same villages were divided among his 14 descendants in 1526. Strategies applied to avoid thisfamily planning and celibacyled to the extinction of most aristocratic families after a few generations.From among the 36 wealthiest families of the late 1430s, 27 families survived till 1490, and only 8 families till 1570. The tenth of all lands in the kingdom was in the possession of about 55 wealthy noble families. Other nobles held almost one third of the lands, but this group included 12‚Äì13,000 peasant-nobles who owned a single plot (or a part of it) and had no tenants. The Diets regularly compelled the peasant-nobles to pay tax on their plots. The Diet ordered the compilation of customary law in 1498. Istv√°n Werb≈ëczy completed the task, presenting a law-book at the Diet in 1514. His Tripartitum'The Custormary Law of the Renowned Kingdom of Hungary in Three Partswas never enacted, but it was consulted at the law courts for centuries. It summarized the noblemen's fundamental privileges in four points: noblemen were only subject to the monarch's authority and could only be arrested in a due legal process, furthermore, they were exempted of all taxes and were entitled to resist the king if he attempted to interfere with their privileges. Werb≈ëczy also implied that Hungary was actually a republic of nobles headed by a monarch, stating that all noblemen \\"are members of the Holy Crown\\"The Customary Law of the Renowned Kingdom of Hungary in Three Parts (1517) (1.4.), p. 53. of Hungary. Quite anachronistically, he emphasized the idea of all noblemen's legal equality, but he had to admit that the high officers of the realm, whom he mentioned as \\"true barons\\", were legally distinguished from other nobles. He also mentioned the existence of a distinct group, who were barons \\"in name only\\", but without specifying their peculiar status. The Tripartitum regarded the kindred as the basic unit of nobility. A noble father exercised almost autocratic authority over his sons, because he could imprison them or offer them as a hostage for himself. His authority ended only if he divided his estates with his sons, but the division could rarely be enforced. The \\"betrayal of fraternal blood\\" (that is, a kinsman's \\"deceitful, sly, and fraudulent ... disinheritance\\")The Customary Law of the Renowned Kingdom of Hungary in Three Parts (1517) (1.39.), p. 105. was a serious crime, which was punished by loss of honor and the confiscation of all property. Although the Tripartitum did not explicitly mention it, a nobleman's wife was also subject to his authority. She received her dower from her husband at the consumpiton of their marriage. If her husband's died, she inherited his best coach-horses and clothes. Demand for foodstuffs rapidly grew in Western Europe in the 1490s. The landowners wanted to take advantage of the growing prices. They demanded labour service from their peasant tenants and started to collect the seigneurial taxes in kind. The Diets passed decrees that restricted the peasants' right to free movement and increased their burdens. The peasants' grievances unexpectedly culminated in a rebellion in May 1514. The rebels captured manor houses and murdered dozens of noblemen, especially in the Great Hungarian Plain. The voivode of Transylvania, John Z√°polya, annihilated their main army at Temesv√°r on 15 July. Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa and other leaders of the peasant war were tortured and executed, but most rebels received a pardon. The Diet punished the peasantry as a group, condemning them to perpetual servitude and depriving them of the right of free movement. The Diet also enacted the serfs' obligation to provide one day's labour service for their lords each week. Early modern and modern times =Tripartite Hungary= The royal party of Hungarian aristocrats in Vienna (1560) The Ottomans annihilated the royal army in the Battle of Moh√°cs. Louis II died fleeing from the battlefield and two claimants, John Z√°polya and Ferdinand of Habsburg, were elected kings. Ferdinand tried to reunite Hungary after Z√°polya died in 1540, but the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent intervened and captured Buda in 1541. The sultan allowed Z√°polya's widow, Isabella Jagiellon, to rule the lands east of the river Tisza on behalf of her infant son, John Sigismund, in return for a yearly tribute. His decision divided Hungary into three parts: the central territories were occupied by the Ottomans; John Sigismund's eastern Hungarian Kingdom developed into the autonomous Principality of Transylvania; and the Habsburg monarchs preserved the northern and western territories (or Royal Hungary). Hungary divided into three parts in 1572: Royal Hungary (and Croatia), Ottoman Hungary and the western territories of the Principality of Transylvania Most noblemen fled from the central regions to the unoccupied territories. Peasants who lived along the borders paid taxes both to the Ottomans and to their former lords. Commoners were regularly recruited to serve in the royal army or the magnates' retinues to replace the noblemen who had perished during the fights. The irregular hajd√∫ foot-soldiersmainly runaway serfs and dispossessed noblemenbecame important elements of the defence forces. Stephen Bocskai, Prince of Transylvania, settled 10,000 hajd√∫s in 7 villages and exempted them of taxation in 1605, which was the \\"largest collective ennoblement\\" in the history of Hungary. The noblemen formed one of the three nations (or Estates of the realm) in Transylvania, but they could rarely challenge the princes' authority. In Royal Hungary, the magnates successfully protected the noble privileges, because their vast domains were almost fully exempted of the royal officials' authority. Their manors were fortified in the \\"Hungarian manner\\" (with walls made of earth and timber) in the 1540s. The Hungarian noblemen could also count on the support of the Transylvanian princes against the Habsburg monarchs. Intermarriages among Austrian, Czech and Hungarian aristocratsThe marriages of the children and grandchildren of Magdolna Sz√©kely by her three husbands established close family links between the Hungarian Sz√©chy and Thurz√≥, the Croatian-Hungarian Zrinski, the Czech Kolowrat, Lobkowicz, Pern≈°tejn, and Ro≈æmberk, and the Austrian or German Arco, Salm and Ungnad families. gave rise to the development of a \\"supranational aristocracy\\" in the Habsburg Monarchy. Foreign aristocrats regularly received Hungarian citizenship, and Hungarian noblemen were often naturalized in the Habsburgs' other realms.The Tyrolian Count Pyrcho von Arco (who married the Hungarian Margit Sz√©chy) were naturalized in Hungary in 1559; the Hungarian Baron Simon Forg√°ch (who married the Austrian Ursula Pemfflinger) received citizenship in Lower Austria in 1568 and in Moravia in 1581. The Habsburg kings rewarded the most powerful magnates with hereditary titles from the 1530s. The aristocrats supported the spread of Reformation. Most noblemen adhered to Lutheranism in the western regions of Royal Hungary, but Calvinism was the dominant religion in other regions and in Transylvania. John Sigismund even promoted anti-Trinitarian views, but most Unitarian noblemen perished in battles in the early 1600s. The Habsburgs remained staunch supporters of Counter-Reformation and the most prominent aristocratic familiesThe Batthy√°ny, Ill√©sh√°zy, N√°dasdy and Thurz√≥ families were the first converts. converted to Catholicism in Royal Hungary in the 1630s. The Calvinist princes of Transylvania supported their co-religionists. Gabriel Bethlen granted nobility to all Calvinist pastors. Both the kings and the Transylvanian princes regularly ennobled commoners without granting landed property to them. Jurisprudence, however, maintained that only those who owned land which was cultivated by serfs could be regarded fully-fledged noblemen. Armalistsnoblemen who hold a charter of ennoblement, but not a single plot of landand peasant-nobles continued to pay taxes, for which they were collectively known as taxed nobility. Nobility could be purchased from the kings who were always in need of funds. Landowners also benefitted from the enoblement of their serfs, because they could demand a fee for their consent. The Diet was officially divided into two chambers in Royal Hungary in 1608. All adult male members of the titled noble families had a seat at the Upper House. The lesser noblemen elected 2 or 3 delegates at the general assemblies of the counties to represent them in the Lower House. The Croatian and Slavonian magnates also had a seat at the Upper House and the sabor (or Diet) of Croatia and Slavonia sent delegates to the Lower House. =Liberation and war of independence= Francis II R√°k√≥czi's mother, Ilona Zrinyi Relief forces from the Holy Roman Empire and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth inflicted a crushing defeat on the Ottomans at Vienna in 1683. The Ottomans were expelled from Buda in 1686. Michael I Apafi, the prince of Transylvania, acknowledged the suzerainty of Emperor Leopold I (who was also king of Hungary) in 1687. Grateful for the liberation of Buda, the Diet abolished the noblemen's right to resist the monarch for the defense of their liberties. Leopold confirmed the privileges of the Transylvanian Estates in 1690. In 1688, the Diet authorized the aristocrats to establish a special trust, known as fideicommissum, with royal consent to prevent the distribution of their landed wealth among their descendants. In accordance with the traditional concept of aviticitas, inherited estates could not be subject to the trust. Estates in fideicommissum were administered by one member of the family, but he was responsible for the proper boarding of his relatives. The Ottomans acknowledged the loss of central Hungary in 1699. Leopold set up a special committee to distribute the lands in the reconquered territories. The descendants of the noblemen who had held estates there before the Ottoman conquest were required to provide documentary evidence to substantiate their claims to the ancestral lands. Even if they could present documents, they were to pay a feea tenth of the value of the claimed propertyas a compensation for the costs of the liberation war. Few noblemen could meet the criteria and more than the half of the recovered lands was distributed among foreigners. They were naturalized, but most of them never visited Hungary. The Habsburg administration doubled the amount of the taxes to be collected in Hungary and demanded almost one third of the taxes (1,25 million florins) from the clergy and the nobility. The palatine, Prince Paul Esterh√°zy, convinced the monarch to reduce the noblemen's tax-burden to 0,25 million florins, but the difference was to be paid by the peasantry. Leopold did not trust the Hungarians, because a group of magnates had conspired against him in the 1670s. Mercenaries replaced the Hungarian garrisons and they frequently plundered the countryside. The monarch also supported Cardinal Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch's attempts to restrict the Protestants' rights. Tens of thousands of Catholic Germans and Orthodox Serbs were settled in the reconquered territories. The outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession gave opportunity for the discontented Hungarians to rise up against Leopold. They regarded one of the wealthiest aristocrats, Prince Francis II R√°k√≥czi, their leader. R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence lasted from 1703 to 1711. Although the rebels were forced to yield, the Treaty of Szatm√°r granted a general amnesty for them and the new Habsburg monarch, Charles III, promised to respect the privileges of the Estates of the realm. =Cooperation, absolutism and reforms= Charles III again confirmed the privileges of the Estates of the \\"Kingdom of Hungary, and the Parts, Kingdoms and Provinces thereto annexed\\" in 1723 in return for the enactment of the Pragmatic Sanction which established his daughters' right to succeed him. Montesquieu who visited Hungary in 1728 regarded the relationship between the king and the Diet as a good example of the separation of powers. The magnates almost monopolized the highest offices, but both the Hungarian Court Chancellerythe supreme body of royal administrationand the Lieutenancy Councilthe most important administrative officealso employed lesser noblemen. Protestants were in practice excluded from public offices after a royal decree, the Carolina Resolutio, obliged all candidates to take an oath on the Virgin Mary. The Esterh√°zy's palace Eszterh√°za at Fert≈ëd The Peace of Szatm√°r and the Pragmatic Sanction maintained that the Hungarian nation consisted of the privileged groups, independently of their ethnicity, but the first debates along ethnic lines appeared in the early 18th century. The jurist Mih√°ly Bencsik claimed that the burghers of Trencs√©n (now Trenƒç√≠n in Slovakia) should not send delegates to the Diet, because their ancestors had been forced to yield to the conquering Magyars in the 890s. A priest, J√°n B. Magin, wrote a response, arguing that ethnic Slovaks and Hungarians enjoyed the same rights. In Transylvania, a bishop of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church, Baron Inocen»õiu Micu-Klein, demanded the recognition of the Romanians as the fourth Nation. Maria Theresa succeeded Charles III in 1740, which gave rise to the War of the Austrian Succession. The noble delegates offered their \\"lives and blood\\" for their new \\"king\\" and the declaration of the general levy of the nobility was crucial at the beginning of the war. Grateful for their support, Maria Therese strengthened the links between the Hungarian nobility and the monarch. She established the Theresian Academy and the Royal Hungarian Bodyguard for young Hungarian noblemen. Both institutions enabled the spread of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment.The former bodyguard, Gy√∂rgy Bessenyei, wrote pamphlets about the importance of education and the cultivation of the Hungarian language in the 1770s. Freemasonry became also popular, especially among the magnates. Cultural differences between the magnates and lesser noblemen increased. The magnates adopted the lifestyle of the imperial aristocracy, moving between their summer palaces in Vienna and their newly built splendid residences in Hungary. Prince Mikl√≥s Esterh√°zy employed Joseph Haydn; Count J√°nos Fekete, a fierce protector of noble privileges, bombarded Voltaire with letters and dilettante poems; Count Mikl√≥s P√°lffy proposed to tax the nobles to finance a standing army. However, most noblemen was unwilling to renounces their privileges. Lesser noblemen also insisted on their traditional way of life and lived in simple houses, made of timber or packed clay. Maria Therese did not hold Diets after 1764. She regulated the relationship of landowners and their serfs in a royal decree in 1767. Her son and successor, Joseph II, known as the \\"king in hat\\", was never crowned, because he wanted to avoid the coronation oath. He introduced reforms which clearly contradicted local customs. He replaced the counties with districts and appointed royal officials to administer them. He also abolished serfdom, securing all peasants' right to free movement after the revolt of Romanian peasants in Transylvania. He ordered the first census in Hungary in 1784. According to its records, the nobility made up about 4,5% of the male population in the Lands of the Hungarian Crown (with 155,519 noblemen in Hungary proper, and with 42,098 noblemen in Transylvania, Croatia and Slavonia). The nobles' proportion was significantly higher (6‚Äì16%) in the northeastern and eastern counties, and lesser (3%) in Croatia and Slavonia. Poor noblemen, who were mocked as \\"nobles of the seven plum trees\\" or \\"sandal-wearing nobles\\", made up almost 90% of the nobility. Previous investigations of nobility show that more than half of the noble families received this rank after 1550. Ferenc Kazinczy in 1780 The few reformist noblemen greeted the news of the French Revolution with enthusiasm. J√≥zsef Hajn√≥czy translated the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen into Latin and J√°nos Laczkovics published its Hungarian translation. To appease the Hungarian nobility, Joseph II revoked almost all his reforms on his deathbed in 1790. His successor, Leopold II, convoked the Diet and confirmed the liberties of the Estates of the realm, emphasizing that Hungary was a \\"free and independent\\" realm, governed by its own laws. News about the Jacobin terror in France strengthened royal power. Hajn√≥czy and other radical (or \\"Jacobin\\") noblemen who had discussed the possibility of the abolishment of all privileges in secret societies were captured and executed or imprisoned in 1795. The Diets voted the taxes and the recruits that Leopold's successor, Francis, demanded between 1792 and 1811. The last general levy of the nobility was declared in 1809, but Napoleon easily defeated the noble troops near Gy≈ër. Agricultural bloom encouraged the landowners to borrow money and to buy new estates or to establish mills during the war, but most of them became bankrupt after peace was restored in 1814. The concept of aviticitas prevented both the creditors from collecting their money and the debtors from selling their estates. Radical nobles played a crucial role in the reform movements of the early 19th century. Gergely Berzeviczy attributed the backwardness of the local economy to the peasants' serfdom already around 1800. Ferenc Kazinczy and J√°nos Bats√°nyi initiated a language reform, fearing of the disappearance of the Hungarian language. The poet S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, who was a commoner, ridiculed the conservative noblemen in his poem The Magyar Noble, contrasting their anachronistic pride and their idle way of life. From the 1820s, a new generation of reformist noblemen dominated the political life. Count Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi demanded the abolition of the serfs' labour service and the entail system, stating that \\"We, well-to-do landowners are the main obstacles to the progress and greater development of our fatherland\\". He established clubs in Pressburg and Pest and promoted horse racing, because he wanted to encourage the regular meetings of magnates, lesser noblemen and burghers. Sz√©chenyi's friend, Baron Mikl√≥s Wessel√©nyi, demanded the creation of a constitutional monarchy and the protection of civil rights. A lesser nobleman, Lajos Kossuth, became the leader of the most radical politicians in the 1840s. He emphasized that the Diets and the counties were the privileged groups' institutions and only a wider social movement could secure the development of Hungary. The official use of the Hungarian language spread from the late 18th century, although ethnic Hungarians made up only about 38% of the population. Kossuth declared that all who wanted to enjoy the liberties of the nation should learn Hungarian. Count Janko Dra≈°koviƒá recommended that Croatian should replace Latin as the official language in Croatia and Slavonia. The Slovak ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r stated that the Hungarian nation consisted of many nationalities and their loyalty could be strengthened by the official use of their languages. =Revolution and neo-absolutism= Count Lajos Batthy√°ny's widow, Countess Ant√≥nia Zichy News of the uprisings in Paris and Vienna reached Pest on 15 March 1848. Young intellectuals proclaimed a radical program, known as the Twelve Points, demanding equal civil rights to all citizens. Count Lajos Batthy√°ny was appointed the first prime minister of Hungary. The Diet quickly enacted the majority of the Twelve Points and Ferdinand V sanctioned them in April. The April Laws abolished the nobles' tax-exemption and the aviticitas, but the 31 fideicommissa remained intact. The peasant tenants received the ownership of their plots, but a compensation was promised to the landowners. Adult men who owned more than arable lands or urban estates with a value of at least 300 florinsabout one quarter of the adult male populationwere granted the right to vote at the parliamentary elections. However, the noblemen's exclusive franchise in county elections was confirmed, because otherwise ethnic minorities could have easily dominated the general assemblies in many counties. Noblemen made up about one quarter of the members of the new parliament, which assembled after the general elections on 5 July. The Slovak delegates demanded autonomy for all ethnic minorities at their assembly in May. Similar demands were adopted at the Romanian delegates' meeting. Ferdinand V's advisors persuaded the ban (or governor) of Croatia, Baron Josip Jelaƒçiƒá, to invade Hungary proper in September. A new war of independence broke out and the Hungarian parliament dethroned the Habsburg dynasty on 14 April 1849. Nicholas I of Russia intervened on the legitimist side and the Russian troops overpowered the Hungarian army, forcing it to surrender on 13 August. Hungary, Croatia (and Slavonia) and Transylvania were incorporated as separate realms in the Austrian Empire. The advisors of the young emperor, Franz Joseph, declared that Hungary had lost its historic rights and the conservative aristocratsCounts Emil Dessewffy, Antal Sz√©csen and Gy√∂rgy Apponyi were their leaders. could not persuade him to restore the old constitution. Noblemen who had remained loyal to the Habsburgs were appointed to high offices,Count Ferenc Zichy had a seat in the Imperial Council, Count Ferenc N√°dasdy was made the Imperial Minister of Justice. but most new officials came from other provinces of the empire. The vast majority of noblemen opted for a passive resistance: they did not hold offices in state administration and tacitly obstructed the implementation of imperial decrees. An untitled nobleman from Zala County, Ferenc De√°k, became their leader around 1854. They tried to preserve an air of superiority, but their vast majority was assimilated to the local peasantry or petty bourgeoisie during the following decades. In contrast with them, the magnates, who retained about one quarter of all lands, could easily raise funds from the developing banking sector to modernize their estates. =Austria-Hungary= The Jewish industrialist Manfr√©d Weiss and his family Count Zsigmond Sz√©chenyi, famous Hungarian hunter, book writer. De√°k and his followers knew that the great powers did not support the disintegration of the Austrian Empire. Austria's defeat in the Austro-Prussian War accelerated the rapprochement between the king and the De√°k Party, which led to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise in 1867. Hungary proper and Transylvania was united and the autonomy of Hungary was restored within the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Next year, the Croatian‚ÄìHungarian Settlement restored the union of Hungary proper and Croatia, but secured the competence of the sabor in internal affairs, education and justice. The Compromise strengthened the position of the traditional political elite. Only about 6% of the population could vote at the general elections. More than half of the prime ministers and one-third of the ministers was appointed from among the magnates from 1867 to 1918. Landowners made up the majority of the members of parliament. Half of the seats in municipal assemblies was preserved for the greatest taxpayers. Noblemen also dominated state administration, because tens of thousands of impoverished nobles took a job at the ministries, or at the state-owned railways and post offices. They were ardent supporters of Magyarization, denying to use the minority languages. Only nobleman who owned an estate of at least were regarded prosperous, but the number of estates reaching that size quickly decreased.The number of estates of between decreased from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1867 to 1900. The magnates took advantage of the lesser noblemen's bankruptcies and bought new estates during the same period. New fideicommissa were created which enabled the magnates to preserve the entailment of their landed wealth. Aristocrats were regularly appointed to the board of directors of banks and companies.In 1905, 88 counts and 66 barons had a seat in boards of directors. Jews were the prime movers of the development of the financing sector and industry. Jewish businessmen owned more than half of the companies and more than four-fifths of the banks in 1910. They also bought landed property and had acquired almost one-fifth of the estates of between by 1913. The most prominent Jewish burghers were awarded with nobilityHenrik L√©vay, who established the first Hungarian insurance company, was ennobled in 1868 and received the title baron in 1897; Zsigmond Kornfeld, who was the \\"Hungarian financial and industrial giant of the age\\", was created baron. and there were 26 aristocratic families and 320 noble families of Jewish origin in 1918. Many of them converted to Christianity, but other nobles did not regard them as their peers. =Revolutions and counter-revolution= Mikl√≥s Horthy's elder son, Istv√°n Horthy, a passionate aviator, who was killed in a flying accident in the Soviet Union during World War II The First World War brought about the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in 1918. The Aster Revolutiona movement of left-liberal, social democrat and radical peoplepersuaded King Charles IV, to appoint the leader of the opposition, Count Mih√°ly K√°rolyi, prime minister on 31 October. After the Lower House dissolved itself, Hungary was proclaimed a republic on 16 November. The Hungarian National Council adopted a land reform, determining the maximum size of the estates at and ordering the distribution of the exceeding part among the local peasantry. K√°rolyi, whose inherited domains had been mortgaged to banks, was the first to implement the reform. The Allied Powers authorized Romania to occupy new territories and ordered the withdrawal of Hungarian troops almost as far as the Tisza on 26 February 1919. K√°rolyi resigned and the Bolshevik B√©la Kun announced the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic on 21 March. All estates of over and all private companies employing more than 20 workers were nationalized. The Bolsheviks could not stop the Romanian invasion and their leaders fled from Hungary on 1 August. After Gyula Peidl's temporary government, the industrialist Istv√°n Friedrich formed a coalition government with the support of the Allied Powers on 6 August. The Bolsheviks' nationalization program was abolished. The social democrats boycotted the general elections in early 1920. The new one-chamber parliament restored the monarchy, but without restoring the Habsburgs. Instead, a Calvinist nobleman, Mikl√≥s Horthy, was elected regent on 1 March 1920. Hungary had to acknowledge the loss of more than two thirds of its territory and more than 60% of its population (including one third of the ethnic Hungarians) in the Treaty of Trianon on 4 June. Horthy, who was not a crowned king, could not grant nobility, but he established a new order of merit, the Order of Gallantry. Its members received the hereditary title of Vit√©z (\\"brave\\"). They were also granted parcels of land, which renewed the \\"medieval link between land tenure and service to the crown\\". Two Transylvanian aristocrats, Counts P√°l Teleki and Istv√°n Bethlen, were the most influential politicians in the interwar period. The events of 1918‚Äì19 convinced them that only a \\"conservative democracy\\", dominated by the landed nobility, could secure stability. Most ministers and the majority of the members of the parliament were nobles. A conservative agrarian reformlimited to 8,5% of all arable landswas introduced, but almost one third of the lands remained in the possession of about 400 magnate families. The two-chamber parliament was restored in 1926, with an Upper House dominated by the aristocrats, prelates and high-ranking officials. Antisemitism was a leading ideology in the 1920s and 1930s. A numerus clausus law limited the admission of Jewish students in the universities. Count Fid√©l P√°lffy was one of the leading figures of the national socialist movements, but most aristocrats disdained the radicalism of \\"petty officers and housekeepers\\". Hungary participated in the German invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 and joined to the war against the Soviet Union after the bombing of Kassa in late June. Fearing of the defection of Hungary from the war, the Germans occupied the country on 19 March 1944. Hundreds of thousands of Jews and tens of thousands of Romani were transferred to Nazi concentration camps with the local authorities' assistance. The wealthiest business magnatesThe Chorins, Weisses and Kornfelds. were to renounce their companies and banks to redeem their and their relatives' lives. =Abolition= The Soviet Red Army reached the Hungarian borders and took possession of the Great Hungarian Plain by 6 December 1944. Delegates from the towns and villages in the region established the Provisional National Assembly in Debrecen, which elected a new government on 22 December. Three prominent Anti-Nazi aristocratsCounts Gyula Dessewffy, Mih√°ly K√°rolyi and G√©za Teleki. had a seat in the assembly. The Provisional National Government soon promised a land reform, along with the abolishment of all \\"anti-democratic\\" laws. The last German troops left Hungary on 4 April 1945. The land reform was announced by Imre Nagy, the Communist Minister of Agriculture, on 17 March 1945. All domains of more than were confiscated and the owners of smaller estates could retain maximum of land. The land reform, as Bryan Cartledge noted, destroyed the nobility and eliminated the \\"elements of feudalism, which had persisted for longer in Hungary than anywhere else in Europe\\". Similar land reforms were also introduced in Romania and Czechoslovakia. In the two countries, ethnic Hungarian aristocrats were sentenced to death or prison as alleged war criminals.Baron Zsigmond Kem√©ny was imprisoned for initiating the execution of 191 Jews in Romania, although he had actually brought food to them. Hungarian aristocratsThe Batthy√°ny, Batthy√°ny‚ÄìStrattman, Erd≈ëdy, Esterh√°zy and Zichy families. could retain their estates only in Burgenland (in Austria) after 1945. The Soviet military authorities controlled the general elections and the formation of a coalition government in late 1945. The new parliament declared Hungary a republic on 1 February 1946. An opinion poll showed that more than 75% of men and 66% of women were opposed to the use of noble titles in 1946. The parliament adopted an act that abolished all noble ranks and related styles, also putting a ban on their use. The new act came into force on 14 February 1947. Unofficial nobility Statute IV of 1947 survived the political change after the fall of the single-party system and the ongoing deregulation processes during and after the 1990s (see for example Statute LXXXII of 2007,2007\\\\. √©vi LXXXII. t√∂rv√©ny (in Hungarian)) and it is still in force today. Multiple attempts have been made to have the Statute revoked, none of them succeeded. In 2009 the Constitutional Court rejected a motion requesting the revocation of 3. ¬ß (1) ‚Äì (4), the ban of using certain titles. Commenting on the rejection, the Constitutional Court felt it On September 27, 2010 (nearing the finish of the campaign for the municipal elections) Istv√°n Tarl√≥s (at the time running for the seat of Mayor in Budapest, nominated by the governing party Fidesz) and Zsolt Semj√©n (Deputy Prime Minister of Hungary, Christian Democratic People's Party, also member of the government), among many other politicians, have been initiated into the Vit√©z Order,Templomot, iskol√°t a magyars√°g√©rt (in Hungarian) an act the Statute explicitly prohibits.

He controlled logging rights for large tracts of forest land in central Ontario, and built the Canada Atlantic Railway (from Georgian Bay via Ottawa to Vermont) to extract his logs and to export lumber and grain to the United States and Europe. In 1892, his lumber complex was the largest operation of its kind in the world. He was familiar with all aspects of his industry, and one observer noted: Early life J. R. Booth was born on a farm at Lowes near Waterloo (Shefford County) in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. His parents, John and Eleanor Booth (n√©e Rowley) were Irish immigrants, had a number of children (variously reported as 5, 6 and 8); his paternal grandparents were John Booth and Elizabeth Hill; his patrilineal grandfather, Robert Booth who married Eleanor Taylor, was the son of Peter Booth,www.darvercastle.ie whose father, James Booth, a Freeman of Dublin, was 4th son of the Revd Humphrey Booth and Letitia Jones.Burke's Peerage & Baronetage, qv. BOOTH, Bt John Booth left the family farm at the age of 21 and got a job as a carpenter with the Central Vermont Railroad. In 1852, he married Rosalinda Cooke and moved to the Ottawa River valley. He was involved in the construction of a paper mill in Sherbrooke, and a sawmill in Hull. Upon completion of the latter, its owner, Andrew Leamyhttp://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/booth_john_rudolphus_15E.html hired him to manage the mill for a year. He then ventured out on his own, opening a shingle mill in Hull in a mill that he rented from Alonzo Wright, but within months it was destroyed by fire. He established his own lumber company and won the contract to supply wood for the Parliament buildings at the new Canadian capital of Ottawa, selected by Queen Victoria in 1858. In winning the contract, he underbid more established firms by hiring unemployed longshoremen from Montreal.

Booth's lumber piling ground Ottawa.jpg|Booth's lumber piling ground =Lumber= Booth harvested timber from the upper Ottawa River and its tributaries, driving them down the river to his mills, and is known to have started logging in the Amable du Fond River and Lake Nosbonsing area in the late 1860s, arriving at Depot Creek in 1870. Booth expanded his timber limits into the Lake Nipissing watershed in 1881. In order to reach his Ottawa mills, Booth constructed the Nosbonsing & Nipissing Railway (length ) in 1884 to carry sawlogs over the portage from Lake Nipissing to the headwaters of the Mattawa. It was subsequently incorporated as a separate company by Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1886. Booth's vision and boldness were qualities that made him a success. In 1867, he purchased, for $40,000, the timber rights of John Egan's of pine on the Madawaska River in what is now Algonquin Park. Five years later, he refused an offer of more than $1 million to sell those rights. During the latter half of the 19th Century, he amassed timber rights approaching in Central and Northern Ontario which he would harvest for his mills. He often went to his Algonquin timber limits in his own private railway car, working beside his men during the day and on business affairs most of the night, seldom sleeping for more than a few hours. He was always on the lookout for opportunities to reduce costs, and in 1894 he began investing in tugboats in order to accelerate the delivery of log booms to the Chaudi√®re mill. In 1891, Booth installed 13 band saws at his Ottawa mill, which was said to be more than anywhere else in the world. The next year, that mill produced 140 million board feet (about ) of lumber. It required the supply of 2 million logs annually in order to run at capacity, and some of his timber limits were so remote that it took up to two years for logs to reach the mill. Booth was so dominant in the industry that he assumed the role of price leader, where all competitors met the prices he set for his product. His leading status would continue until 1919, when William Cameron Edwards and others would achieve greater outputs. Half of the mills' output was shipped to England; the rest to the United States and throughout Canada. White pine from Booth's lumber yards was used to build the decks on the ocean liners of the Cunard Line, including the Lusitania and Mauretania. In 1905, he constructed a new plant and entered the pulp and paper business, thus being able to use softwood that he had been previously forced to sell. He expanded into the United States through the establishment of docks and a distribution centre at Rouses Point, New York, a planing mill and box factory at Burlington, Vermont, and a sales office in Boston. The mills' output was so large that its Fraserfield lumber yard and railyard, acquired in 1870, extended along Bronson Avenue as far south as Carling Avenue, backing onto The Glebe. The Chaudi√®re Island mills were so extensive that Booth issued tokens for use there, which were in circulation from 1893 until the 1940s. Fire was a constant threat to his mills, and they burnt down in 1893, 1886, 1900 and 1903. In 1900 alone, 100 million feet of lumber was lost to fire, and Booth also lost his home located at Wellington and Preston Street., at pp. 41-43 The extent of the fire led to a controversial proposal to restrict the amount of lumber being held in the yards, but intensive lobbying by Booth and other lumbermen effectively killed that measure as well as a later one in 1903. Much of Booth's personal and business records were lost in these fires. It was also of concern within the timber limits as well, and Booth once said, \\"If fires are kept out of the forests, there will be more pine in this country 100 years from now than there was fifty years ago, and we shall have lots of timber for the generation to come.\\" Booth established a hydroelectric generating station at Chaudi√®re Falls in 1909 in order to power his sawmill and planing mill, after fifty years of using penstocks distributed around his property to directly feed the water turbines that powered his machinery. The construction of the station resulted in the water level of the Ottawa River being raised by , which meant the end of log rafting there. =Railways= Formation of Canada Atlantic Booth's sawmill operations could never run at full capacity because the output could not be carried out of the lumber yards fast enough. Because of these transportation problems in the Ottawa area, Booth became an important participant in the development of Canada's railway system when he purchased the Montreal and City of Ottawa Junction Railway (M&OJ;) and the Coteau and Province Line Railway and Bridge Company (C&PL;) in 1879, amalgamating them to form the Canada Atlantic Railway. The M&OJ; had received a charter to build southeast from Ottawa to Coteau Landing on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River. The C&PL; had received a charter to build a bridge across the St. Lawrence River to Valleyfield, Quebec and then operate a railway across southwestern Quebec to the United States border. Due to financial difficulties, neither line had been completed, and Booth worked to complete the entire route by 1882. The Coteau bridge was completed in 1890, thus eliminating the necessity of transshipping cargo by barge. The CAR formed a subsidiary, the Vermont and Province Line Railroad, which would build a line to Swanton, Vermont on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain in 1897, thus connecting Ottawa to the United States via the Delaware and Hudson Railway, the Rutland Railroad, and the Central Vermont Railway. Expansion to Georgian Bay The diamond crossing between the OA&PS; and B&O; was the site of several collisions over its history, a tribute to its equally stormy building. The rough terrain of the Canadian Shield is evident in this photo of the OA&PS; being built through the area of today's Algonquin Park. Note the lack of vegetation in what is today completely covered by forest. In 1888, Booth chartered the Ottawa, Arnprior and Renfrew Railway to build a line from Ottawa to Renfrew, as well as the Ottawa and Parry Sound Railway to do the same from Parry Sound to Renfrew. In 1891, the two lines (together with the Parry Sound Colonization Railway in 1893) were amalgamated into the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (OA&PS;), which ran from Georgian Bay through southern Algonquin Park to Ottawa., and When the PSCR was taken over by Booth, the original intention was to have its terminus at Parry Sound. However, the high prices demanded by local landowners prompted him to choose a location on nearby Parry Island, which would become Depot Harbour. When completed, Depot Harbour became one of the most prominent ports on the Great Lakes, rivalling Collingwood, Midland and Owen Sound. It was the shortest route for shipping grain to the Atlantic, with trains arriving and departing every twenty minutes. All three lines met \\"end to end\\". The M&OJ; met the OA&PS; on Booth's sawmill property in Ottawa while the C&PL; met the M&OJ; in Coteau, using several hundred feet of trackage rights of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). In 1899, the OA&PS; amalgamated with the CAR. As a result, Booth ruled the largest railway empire built in North America by any one man. It was said that the first phase of the CAR's construction was undertaken without any government assistance, which was unusual at the time. Booth himself was concerned with building the railways as well as marketing the service to build and maintain tonnage on the new lines. He was open to cooperation with other railways in eastern and western Canada, as well as to sale or amalgamation with a larger railway system, and was contemplating such a sale by 1901. Whether it was because Booth at age 74 was tired, or because he realized that competition from other transcontinental lines would soon cause serious problems for the CAR, he did everything possible in the early years of the 20th century to make every aspect of the railway profitable, and therefore attractive to potential buyers. Booth also operated grain elevators at Depot Harbour, Coteau, Duluth and Milwaukee, and steamships on the Great Lakes, and formed the Canada Atlantic Transit Company, which operated five large lake freighters on the Upper Great Lakes. Grand Trunk Elevators, Depot Harbour, Georgian Bay, Ontario, Canada (1910) (5444702599).jpg|Depot Harbour elevators in 1910 OAPS at Depot Harbour.jpg|OA&PS; engine #701 2-8-0 built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. The engine is shown in Depot Harbour, the western end of the line. Sale to Grand Trunk Prompted by the federal government, the Grand Trunk Railway began negotiating with Booth to acquire the Canada Atlantic as part of the Grand Trunk's efforts to expand into northern Ontario and eventually into Western Canada. In August 1904 the GTR agreed to purchase the Canada Atlantic system, including the Great Lakes steamship fleet and the line in Vermont which connected with its Central Vermont Railway subsidiary. The agreed-upon price for the entire system as well as the Depot Harbour and Ottawa terminals was $16,000,000. The Grand Trunk took over all operations of the CAR on 1 October 1905, but the actual purchase was ratified by Parliament only in 1914. Booth was subsequently one of the GTR's directors until its nationalization as part of the Canadian National Railways in 1923. =Other interests= International Portland Cement Company, Hull, Quebec (1904), a predecessor of Canada Cement Company, and one in which J.R. Booth was a significant investor. At the creation of the Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses in 1890 in Ottawa, he was a member of the Provisional Committee. Later in 1892, he became Life Governor of that same Institute by paying at least the amount of $500The Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses, incorporated 1890. Ottawa: Free Press Office, Cor. Queen and Elgin Street, 1892. Scanned reproduction of original artifacts. Scholar Select.. Booth was a significant investor in the Canada Cement Company formed by Max Aitken, which is now part of Lafarge. He was also a director of Foster- Cobalt Mining which took part in the Cobalt silver rush, whose origin took place on one of Booth's timber limits. Together with M.J. O'Brien, he also invested in The Dominion Nickel-Copper Company (owner of the Murray Mine) in order to create a potential competitor to International Nickel. It was subsequently sold to Frederick Stark Pearson, William Mackenzie and Donald Mann and became the British America Nickel Corporation, in which Booth was a director. In 1921, Booth was induced to vote in favour of a bondholders' reorganization scheme through the promised issue of $2,000,000 of British American stock. The reorganization was later held by the Ontario courts as not binding on the minority bondholders, and the ruling was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in a decision that has influenced corporate jurisprudence throughout the British Commonwealth. After Inco drove British American into bankruptcy in 1924 by aggressively cutting the price of nickel, it later acquired British American's assets. =Later years= J. R. Booth continued to run his business empire well into his nineties. Only in 1921 did he convert it from a sole proprietorship into a corporation (known as J.R. Booth Limited). He died in 1925 at the age of 98 after being ill for several months and was survived by his sons Jackson, John Frederick, daughter Helen Gertrude Fleck and several grandchildren and great grandchildren. In 1943, J.R. Booth Limited, with the exception of its lumber division, was sold to George Weston Limited to become part of the E. B. Eddy Company. The lumber mill was later sold to E. B. Eddy in 1946.

The Britannia Heights Methodist Church formed in 1873.Ottawa Journal \\"Britannia United Church\\" 2 October 1976 :* The acreage he acquired for pasturing the horses for his mills would later become the Dominion Experimental Farm. :* Booth also had a summer home in Kingsmere, Quebec, on the north shore of Kingsmere Lake. In Algonquin Provincial Park, Booth Lake is named after him. However, most other traces of Booth's interests in the Park (including a summer retreat at the Barclay Estate on Rock Lake) were razed by the Province of Ontario as their leases on crown land ran out. Two geographic townships have been named after him. In Quebec, Booth Township was surveyed and established in 1908. It is located east of Kipawa, and is part of the unorganized territory of Les Lacs-du-T√©miscamingue in the T√©miscamingue Regional County Municipality. In Ontario, Booth Township was surveyed and established in 1962. It is located immediately north of Nipigon in Thunder Bay District. In 1892, Booth rented a cottage at Saranac Lake, New York, where his daughter would cure for several years. Booth brought a pair of skis with him, thus introducing the sport of skiing to the area. One of Booth's descendants noted in 2016 that the manner in which his predecessor had gathered his wealth was exceptional in comparison to \\"really old-school wealthy families\\" in Canada, \\"as most of them came from the booze business, which was illegal. So they didn‚Äôt pay taxes; it was all cash. So what J.R. did was that much more impressive.\\" Death, descendants and legacy Booth died in December 1925. On his passing, Michael Grattan O'Leary of the Ottawa Journal noted that what people should remember about him was that he was: Also at that time, William Lyon Mackenzie King observed: Booth's fortune was a subject of much speculative commentary during the latter years of his life, with estimates ranging up to $100 million. At his death his estate was officially valued at almost $7.7 million; the property was later re-evaluated upwards to $23 million. Although succession duties of $4.28 million were paid in 1927, in 1937 Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn subsequently claimed more and had the Legislative Assembly of Ontario pass the necessary legislation to overcome the legal obstacles. J.R's heirs eventually paid another $3 million in 1939. His son John Frederick Booth, who lived in Canada, married and had a daughter Lois Frances Booth (born Ottawa, Ontario, 2 August 1897; died Copenhagen, 26 February 1941), who was married in Ottawa, Ontario, on 11 February 1924 to Count Erik of Rosenborg, whom she divorced in 1937; they had two children. At the time of the marriage, it was rumoured that Booth contributed half of her $4-million dowry. J.R. issued a formal denial. She later remarried Thorkild Juelsberg, without issue. =Siblings and descendants= 100px * John Booth (18021877), m.

The Frobenius method enables one to create a power series solution to such a differential equation, provided that p(z) and q(z) are themselves analytic at 0 or, being analytic elsewhere, both their limits at 0 exist (and are finite).  Explanation  The method of Frobenius is to seek a power series solution of the form : u(z)=z^r \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^k, \\\\qquad (A_0 eq 0) Differentiating: : u'(z)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)A_kz^{k+r-1} : u(z)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r-1)(k+r)A_kz^{k+r-2} Substituting the above differentiation into our original ODE: : z^2\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r-1)(k+r)A_kz^{k+r-2} + zp(z) \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)A_kz^{k+r-1} + q(z)\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r} : = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r-1) (k+r)A_kz^{k+r} + p(z) \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)A_kz^{k+r} + q(z) \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r} : = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty [(k+r-1)(k+r) A_kz^{k+r} + p(z) (k+r) A_kz^{k+r} + q(z) A_kz^{k+r}] : = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left[(k+r-1)(k+r) + p(z)(k+r) + q(z)\\\\right] A_kz^{k+r} : = \\\\left[ r(r-1)+p(z)r+q(z) \\\\right] A_0z^r+\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left[ (k+r-1)(k+r)+p(z)(k+r)+q(z) \\\\right] A_kz^{k+r}=0 The expression : r\\\\left(r-1\\\\right) + p\\\\left(0\\\\right)r + q\\\\left(0\\\\right) = I(r) is known as the indicial polynomial, which is quadratic in r. The general definition of the indicial polynomial is the coefficient of the lowest power of z in the infinite series. In this case it happens to be that this is the rth coefficient but, it is possible for the lowest possible exponent to be r ‚àí 2, r ‚àí 1 or, something else depending on the given differential equation. This detail is important to keep in mind. In the process of synchronizing all the series of the differential equation to start at the same index value (which in the above expression is k = 1), one can end up with complicated expressions. However, in solving for the indicial roots attention is focused only on the coefficient of the lowest power of z. Using this, the general expression of the coefficient of zk + r is :I(k+r)A_k+\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}{(j+r)p^{(k-j)}(0)+q^{(k-j)}(0) \\\\over (k-j)!}A_j, These coefficients must be zero, since they should be solutions of the differential equation, so :I(k+r)A_k+\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} {(j+r)p^{(k-j)}(0)+q^{(k-j)}(0) \\\\over (k-j)!} A_j=0 :\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}{(j+r)p^{(k-j)}(0)+q^{(k-j)}(0) \\\\over (k-j)!}A_j=-I(k+r)A_k :{1\\\\over-I(k+r)}\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k-1}{(j+r)p^{(k-j)}(0)+q^{(k-j)}(0) \\\\over (k-j)!}A_j=A_k The series solution with Ak above, :U_{r}(z)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty}A_kz^{k+r} satisfies :z^2U_{r}(z)+p(z)zU_{r}(z)'+q(z)U_{r}(z)=I(r)z^r If we choose one of the roots to the indicial polynomial for r in Ur(z), we gain a solution to the differential equation. If the difference between the roots is not an integer, we get another, linearly independent solution in the other root.  Example  Let us solve : z^2f-zf'+(1-z)f=0\\\\, Divide throughout by z2 to give : f-{1\\\\over z}f'+{1-z \\\\over z^2}f=f-{1\\\\over z}f'+\\\\left({1\\\\over z^2} - {1 \\\\over z}\\\\right) f = 0 which has the requisite singularity at z = 0\\\\. Use the series solution : \\\\begin{align} f &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ f' &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)A_kz^{k+r-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ f &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)(k+r-1)A_kz^{k+r-2} \\\\end{align} Now, substituting : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty &(k+r)(k+r-1) A_kz^{k+r-2}-\\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)A_kz^{k+r-1} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{z^2} - \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\right) \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)(k+r-1) A_kz^{k+r-2} -\\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r) A_kz^{k+r-1} +\\\\frac{1}{z^2} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r} -\\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)(k+r-1)A_kz^{k+r-2}-\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)A_kz^{k+r-2}+\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r-2}-\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)(k+r-1)A_kz^{k+r-2}-\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r) A_kz^{k+r-2} + \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r-2} - \\\\sum_{k-1=0}^\\\\infty A_{k-1}z^{k-1+r-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)(k+r-1)A_kz^{k+r-2}-\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty (k+r)A_kz^{k+r-2}+\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty A_kz^{k+r-2}-\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty A_{k-1}z^{k+r-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left ((k+r)(k+r-1) - (k+r) + 1\\\\right ) A_kz^{k+r-2} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} -\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty A_{k-1}z^{k+r-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left ( r(r-1) - r +1 \\\\right ) A_0 z^{r-2} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left ((k+r)(k+r-1) - (k+r) + 1\\\\right ) A_kz^{k+r-2} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty A_{k-1}z^{k+r-2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (r-1)^2 A_0 z^{r-2} + \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} (k+r-1)^2 A_kz^{k+r-2} - \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty A_{k-1}z^{k+r-2} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (r-1)^2 A_0 z^{r-2} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left ( (k+r-1)^2 A_k - A_{k-1} \\\\right ) z^{k+r-2} \\\\end{align} From (r ‚àí 1)2 = 0 we get a double root of 1. Using this root, we set the coefficient of zk + r ‚àí 2 to be zero (for it to be a solution), which gives us: : (k+1-1)^2 A_k - A_{k-1} =k^2A_k-A_{k-1}=0 hence we have the recurrence relation: : A_k = \\\\frac{A_{k-1}}{k^2} Given some initial conditions, we can either solve the recurrence entirely or obtain a solution in power series form. Since the ratio of coefficients A_k/A_{k-1} is a rational function, the power series can be written as a generalized hypergeometric series. Roots separated by an integer The previous example involved an indicial polynomial with a repeated root, which gives only one solution to the given differential equation. In general, the Frobenius method gives two independent solutions provided that the indicial equation's roots are not separated by an integer (including zero). If the root is repeated or the roots differ by an integer, then the second solution can be found using: : y_2 = C y_1 \\\\ln x + \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty B_kx^{k+r_2} where y_1(x) is the first solution (based on the larger root in the case of unequal roots), r_2 is the smaller root, and the constant and the coefficients B_k are to be determined. Once B_0 is chosen (for example by setting it to 1) then and the B_k are determined up to but not including B_{r_1-r_2}, which can be set arbitrarily. This then determines the rest of the B_k. In some cases the constant must be zero. For example, consider the following differential equation (Kummer's equation with and ): :zu+(2-z)u'-u=0 The roots of the indicial equation are ‚àí1 and 0. Two independent solutions are 1/z and (e^z)/z, so we see that the logarithm does not appear in any solution. The solution (e^z-1)/z has a power series starting with the power zero. In a power series starting with z^{-1} the recurrence relation places no restriction on the coefficient for the term z^0, which can be set arbitrarily. If it is set to zero then with this differential equation all the other coefficients will be zero and we obtain the solution 1/.

It is the technology used to produce chlorine and sodium hydroxide (lye/caustic soda), which are commodity chemicals required by industry. 35 million tons of chlorine were prepared by this process in 1987. The chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced in this process are widely used in the chemical industry. Usually the process is conducted on a brine (an aqueous solution of NaCl), in which case NaOH, hydrogen, and chlorine result. When using calcium chloride or potassium chloride, the products contain calcium or potassium instead of sodium. Related processes are known that use molten NaCl to give chlorine and sodium metal or condensed hydrogen chloride to give hydrogen and chlorine. The process has a high energy consumption, for example around 2500 kWh of electricity per tonne of sodium hydroxide produced. Because the process yields equivalent amounts of chlorine and sodium hydroxide (two moles of sodium hydroxide per mole of chlorine), it is necessary to find a use for these products in the same proportion. For every mole of chlorine produced, one mole of hydrogen is produced. Much of this hydrogen is used to produce hydrochloric acid, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, or is burned for power and/or steam production.  History  Chloralkali process has been in use since the 19th century and is a primary industry in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan.It has become the principal source of chlorine during the 20th century. The diaphragm cell process, and the mercury cell process have been used for over 100 years and are environmentally unfriendly through their use of asbestos and mercury, respectively, but the membrane cell process was only developed in the past 60 years. The membrane cell process is a superior method in its energy efficiency and lack of harmful chemicals. Although the first formation of chlorine by the electrolysis of brine was attributed to Cruikshank in 1800, it was 90 years later that the electrolytic method was used successfully on a commercial scale. The Industrial scale production began in 1892.In 1833, Faraday formulated the laws that governed the electrolysis of aqueous solutions, and patents were issued to Cook and Watt in 1851 and to Stanley in 1853 for the electrolytic production of chlorine from brine.Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920 Process systems Three production methods are in use. While the mercury cell method produces chlorine-free sodium hydroxide, the use of several tonnes of mercury leads to serious environmental problems. In a normal production cycle a few hundred pounds of mercury per year are emitted, which accumulate in the environment. Additionally, the chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced via the mercury-cell chloralkali process are themselves contaminated with trace amounts of mercury. The membrane and diaphragm method use no mercury, but the sodium hydroxide contains chlorine, which must be removed. =Membrane cell= The most common chloralkali process involves the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (a brine) in a membrane cell. A membrane, such as one made from Nafion, Flemion or Aciplex, is used to prevent the reaction between the chlorine and hydroxide ions. Basic membrane cell used in the electrolysis of brine. At the anode (A), chloride (Cl‚àí) is oxidized to chlorine. The ion-selective membrane (B) allows the counterion Na+ to freely flow across, but prevents anions such as hydroxide (OH‚àí) and chloride from diffusing across. At the cathode (C), water is reduced to hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The net process is the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of NaCl into industrially useful products sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and chlorine gas. Saturated brine is passed into the first chamber of the cell where the chloride ions are oxidised at the anode, losing electrons to become chlorine gas (A in figure): :2Cl‚àí ‚Üí + 2e‚àí At the cathode, positive hydrogen ions pulled from water molecules are reduced by the electrons provided by the electrolytic current, to hydrogen gas, releasing hydroxide ions into the solution (C in figure): :2 + 2e‚àí ‚Üí H2 \\\\+ 2OH‚àí The ion- permeable ion exchange membrane at the center of the cell allows the sodium ions (Na+) to pass to the second chamber where they react with the hydroxide ions to produce caustic soda (NaOH) (B in figure). The overall reaction for the electrolysis of brine is thus: :2NaCl + 2 ‚Üí + + 2NaOH =Diaphragm cell= In the diaphragm cell process, there are two compartments separated by a permeable diaphragm, often made of asbestos fibers. Brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows into the cathode compartment. Similarly to the Membrane Cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode to produce chlorine, and at the cathode, water is split into caustic soda and hydrogen. The diaphragm prevents the reaction of the caustic soda with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation. =Mercury cell= Mercury cell for chloralkali process In the mercury-cell process, also known as the Castner‚ÄìKellner process, a saturated brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a sodium-mercury amalgam with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the electrolytic cell. Chlorine is produced at the anode and bubbles out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about mercury poisoning from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see Ontario Minamata disease) and Japan (see Minamata disease). Unpartitioned cell The initial overall reaction produces hydroxide and also hydrogen and chlorine gases: :2 NaCl + 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 NaOH + H2 \\\\+ Cl2 Without a membrane, the OH‚àí ions produced at the cathode are free to diffuse throughout the electrolyte. As the electrolyte becomes more basic due to the production of OH‚àí, less Cl2 emerges from the solution as it begins to disproportionate to form chloride and hypochlorite ions at the anode: :Cl2 \\\\+ 2 NaOH ‚Üí NaCl + NaClO + H2O The more opportunity the Cl2 has to interact with NaOH in the solution, the less Cl2 emerges at the surface of the solution and the faster the production of hypochlorite progresses. This depends on factors such as solution temperature, the amount of time the Cl2 molecule is in contact with the solution, and concentration of NaOH. Likewise, as hypochlorite increases in concentration, chlorates are produced from them: : 3 NaClO ‚Üí NaClO3 \\\\+ 2 NaCl This reaction is accelerated at temperatures above about 60 ¬∞C. Other reactions occur, such as the self-ionization of water and the decomposition of hypochlorite at the cathode, the rate of the latter depends on factors such as diffusion and the surface area of the cathode in contact with the electrolyte. If current is interrupted while the cathode is submerged, cathodes that are attacked by hypochlorites, such as those made from stainless steel, will dissolve in unpartitioned cells. If producing hydrogen and oxygen gases is not a priority, the addition of 0.18% sodium or potassium chromate to the electrolyte will improve the efficiency of producing the other products. Electrodes Due to the corrosive nature of chlorine production, the anode (where the chlorine is formed) must be non-reactive and has been made from platinum metal, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday's time), platinized titanium. A mixed metal oxide clad titanium anode (also called a dimensionally stable anode) is the industrial standard today. Historically, platinum, magnetite, lead dioxide, manganese dioxide, and ferrosilicon (13-15% silicon) have also been used as anodes. Platinum alloyed with iridium is more resistant to corrosion from chlorine than pure platinum. Unclad titanium cannot be used as an anode because it anodizes, forming a non- conductive oxide and passivates. Graphite will slowly disintegrate due to internal electrolytic gas production from the porous nature of the material and carbon dioxide forming due to carbon oxidation, causing fine particles of graphite to be suspended in the electrolyte that can be removed by filtration. The cathode (where hydroxide forms) can be made from unalloyed titanium, graphite, or a more easily oxidized metal such as stainless steel or nickel. Manufacturer associations The interests of chloralkali product manufacturers are represented at regional, national and international levels by associations such as Euro Chlor and The World Chlorine Council.

The initial contributor was holiday camp owner Billy Butlin, who anonymously donated ¬£100,000. Public donations soon swelled the fund to one million pounds.

Geography Camooweal is in north-western Queensland, Australia, located north-west of the city of Mount Isa and east of the Northern Territory border. The town lies on the Barkly Highway, and is adjacent to the Georgina River. History The area was originally inhabited by the Indjilandji Indigenous Australians.Roberts, Tony Frontier Justice: A history of the Gulf Country to 1900, UQP, 2005, p 3, The town is said to take its name from surveyor Mr GT Weale, who was apparently the first person to bring camels into the area, although this has been questioned. William Landsborough in 1861 named the Barkly Tablelands after the Governor of Victoria, His Excellency, Sir Henry Barkly. The first settler to the area was John Sutherland, who took up the Rocklands lease in 1865. Stock losses to the local dingos and wedge- tailed eagles; lack of water and isolation soon forced him to abandon his lease. The Englishmen Benjamin Crosthwaite and William Tetley, who were marginally more successful, took up the lease again in 1876. The initial town was gazetted in 1884 to be built on a plot by Lake Francis. A year later the present site was re-gazetted and Camooweal Post Office opened on 27 April 1885. Other milestones for the town were the addition of a police station in 1886, opening of a provisional school in 1893, drilling of the town bore in 1897 and the arrival of electricity in 1952. On 2 January 1931, a Qantas Air Ambulance from the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia flown by E.G. Donaldson rescued a man in Camooweal and delivered him to Brisbane. The road through Camooweal to the Northern Territory was the inland defence route for World War II. This road was built by army engineers and carried over 1000 vehicles a day and there are numerous historical sites marked along the road. At the 2011 census, Camooweal had a population of 187. Heritage listings Camooweal has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Barkly Highway: Community Hall * Barkly Highway: Tree of Knowledge * Barkly Street: Freckleton's Stores * Rocklands Station: Hodgkinson's Marked Tree Amenities Along the main road (the Barkly Highway) there are several caravan stops or van parks which will take mobile homes and tents. There is an airstrip that is used by the Royal Flying Doctor Service to bring medical services to the town. Australian country musician Slim Dusty recorded a song written by David Kirkpatrick and Alex \\"Mack\\" Cormack entitled simply Camooweal which features this town.

Honda Tadakatsu was one of the Tokugawa Four Heavenly Kings along with Ii Naomasa, Sakakibara Yasumasa and Sakai Tadatsugu.  Biography  Okazaki, Aichi PrefectureÔºâ A native of Mikawa Province in Japan, he lived during the Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama and Edo periods. Ieyasu promoted him from daimy≈ç/lord of the ≈åtaki han/domain ( koku) to the Kuwana han ( koku) as a reward for his service.Ê°ëÂêçËó© In addition, his son Honda Tadatomo became daimyo of ≈åtaki.Â§ßÂ§öÂñúËó© In 1609, he retired, and his other son Tadamasa took over Kuwana. Tadakatsu's daughter, Komatsuhime was Sanada Nobuyuki's lawful wife and mother of Sanada Nobumasa, daimy≈ç of Matsushiro Domain. His grandson, Tadatoki, married the granddaughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Senhime. Despite his years of loyal service, Tadakatsu became increasingly estranged from the Tokugawa shogunate (bakufu) as it evolved from a military to a civilian political institution. This was a fate shared by many other warriors of the time, who were not able to make the conversion from the chaotic lifetime of warfare of the Sengoku period to the more stable peace of the Tokugawa shogunate. Such was Honda's reputation that he attracted notice from the most influential figures in Japan at the time. Oda Nobunaga, who was notoriously disinclined to praise his followers called him a \\"samurai among samurai\\". Moreover, Toyotomi Hideyoshi noted that the best samurai were \\"Honda Tadakatsu in the east and Tachibana Muneshige in the west\\". Even Takeda Shingen praised Honda, saying that \\"[h]e is a luxury of Tokugawa Ieyasu\\". It was widely acknowledged that he was a reputed samurai and a loyal retainer of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Tadakatsu is often referred to as \\"The Warrior who surpassed Death itself\\" because he never once suffered a significant wound, despite being the veteran of over 100 battles by the end of his life, and because he was never defeated by another samurai. In theater and other contemporary works, Tadakatsu is often characterized as polar opposite of Ieyasu's other great general, Ii Naomasa. While both were fierce warriors of the Tokugawa, Tadakatsu's ability to elude injury is often contrasted with the common depiction of Naomasa enduring many battle wounds, but fighting through them. Service under Ieyasu Tadakatsu's position in the Battle of Sekigahara. Armor of Honda Tadakatsu Honda Tadakatsu is generally regarded as one of Tokugawa Ieyasu's finest generals, and he fought in almost all of his master's major battles. He gained distinction at the Battle of Anegawa (1570), helping in the defeat of the armies under the Azai and Asakura clans along with Tokugawa's ally, Oda Nobunaga. Tadakatsu also served at Tokugawa's greatest defeat, the Battle of Mikatagahara (1572), where he commanded the left wing of his master's army, facing off against troops under one of the Takeda clan's more notable generals, Nait≈ç Masatoyo. Although that battle ended in defeat, Honda Tadakatsu was one of those Tokugawa generals present to exact vengeance upon the Takeda at the Battle of Nagashino (1575). Honda commanded a rank of musketeers as the combined Oda-Tokugawa forces annihilated Takeda Katsuyori's army, partly thanks to the skillful use of ranked muskets, as they fired in cycling volleys. One would fire while another was reloading and another was cleaning the barrel of the musket. This enabled the muskets to fire without stopping, effectively destroying the Takeda army. His finest moment came in the Komaki Campaign (1584). Left at Komaki while Ieyasu departed to engage Toyotomi troops at Nagakute, Tadakatsu observed a huge host under Hideyoshi himself move out in pursuit. With a handful of men, Tadakatsu rode out and challenged the Toyotomi army from the opposite bank of the Sh≈çnai River. Toyotomi Hideyoshi (who outnumbered Honda by up to 50 or 60 to 1) was said to have been struck by the bravery of this warrior, and ordered that no harm come to him, his men, or Ishikawa Yasumichi, who accompanied him on this bid to buy time for Ieyasu. Tadakatsu had a major role in the 1600 Battle of Kuisegawa, where he successfully rescued the Tokugawa officers Nakamura Kazuhide and Arima Toyouji, who were ambushed by the Western Army officers Shima Sakon and Akashi Teruzumi Honda Tadakatsu was present at the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), where Tokugawa Ieyasu's forces defeated the western alliance of daimyo under Ishida Mitsunari, allowing Tokugawa to assume control of the country, bringing the Sengoku era to a close. Tadakatsu seems to have been a colorful figure, around whom a few legends have sprung up - it is often said that of all the battles in which he served, he never once received a wound. His helmet, famously adorned with deer antlers, ensured that he was always a recognizable figure on the field of battle. His horse was known as Mikuniguro. His spear was named Tonbo-Giri, or Dragonfly Cutter, because legend held that the tip of the spear was so sharp that a dragonfly that landed on it was cut in two. His fighting prowess with it was so great that it became known as one of the \\"Three Great Spears of Japan\\". Aside from this incredible spear, Tadakatsu also used the katana Nakatsukasa Masamune (‰∏≠ÂãôÊ≠£ÂÆó), a 67 cm blade, another national treasure of Japan. Popular culture Honda Tadakatsu appears in numerous Japanese jidaigeki (hisotorical dramas for television) set in the 16th century. He is a minor character in Akira Kurosawa's movie Kagemusha. Honda Tadakatsu, or fictive characters based loosely on the historical figure, appears in several video games and associated anime, including the Sengoku Basara games and anime, Samurai Warriors, Warriors Orochi, and Pokemon Conquest.

She appeared in over 100 films, but was unable to make the transition to sound films. Early life Born Virginia Flugrath on June 26, 1897 in Brooklyn, New York City, where she was raised, she was the middle sister of three siblings who all became actresses. Her sisters were known as Edna Flugrath and Shirley Mason. Dana appeared on the stage at the age of three. She read Shakespeare and particularly identified with the teenage Juliet. She enjoyed a long run at the Hudson Theater in Manhattan. Between 1910 and 1912, she made four small appearances in the emergent film industry in New York, using the name Viola Flugrath. A particular favorite of audiences was her performance in David Belasco's Poor Little Rich Girl when she was 16. She began performing in vaudeville with Dustin Farnum in The Little Rebel and played a bit part in The Model by Augustus Thomas.Stone, Tammy. \\"Viola Dana.\\" The Silent Collection; retrieved October 22, 2014. Film career With the stage name of Viola Dana, she entered films in 1910, including A Christmas Carol (1910). Her first motion picture was made at a former Manhattan (New York) riding academy on West 61st Street. The stalls had been transformed to dressing rooms. Dana became a star with the Edison Manufacturing Company, working at their studio in the Bronx. She fell in love with Edison director John Hancock Collins, and they married in 1915. Dana's success in Collins's Edison features such as Children of Eve (1915) and The Cossack Whip (1916) encouraged producer B.A. Rolfe to offer the couple lucrative contracts with his company, Rolfe Photoplays, which released through Metro Pictures Corporation. Dana and Collins accepted Rolfe's offer in 1916 and made several films for Rolfe/Metro, notably The Girl Without a Soul and Blue Jeans (both 1917). Rolfe closed his New York-area studio in the face of the 1918 flu pandemic and sent most of his personnel to California. Dana left before Collins, who was finishing work at the studio; however, Collins contracted influenza and died in a New York hotel room on October 23, 1918. Dana remained in California acting for Metro throughout the 1920s, but her popularity gradually waned. One of her latter roles was in Frank Capra's first film for Columbia Pictures, That Certain Thing (1928). She retired from the screen in 1929. Her final screen credits are roles in Two Sisters (1929), One Splendid Hour (1929), and with her sister Leonie Flugrath, better known as Shirley Mason (years earlier she had appeared with her older sister, Edna Flugrath, in the 1923 film The Social Code), in The Show of Shows (1929). By the time she made her final film appearance in 1933, she had appeared in over 100 films. She briefly came out of retirement to appear in her first and only television role in a small part on Lux Video Theatre in 1956.Lussier, Tim. \\"The tragic Flugrath sisters: Hard to believe, But all three experienced the same loss.\\" silentsaregolden.com, 1999.

Ahmed Tekuder (Mongolian: Teg√ºlder, meaning ‚Äúperfect‚Äù; ) (c.1246 10 August 1284), also known as Sultan Ahmad (reigned 1282‚Äì1284), was the sultan of the Persian-based Ilkhanate, son of Hulegu and brother of Abaqa. He was eventually succeeded by his nephew Arghun Khan. Early life Tekuder was born c. 1246 in Mongolia to Hulagu and Qutui Khatun from Khongirad tribe as his seventh son. His birth date is not mentioned elsewhere but according to sources he died at age of 37, therefore his birth year must have been around 1246 or 1247. He was baptized in his childhood as a Nestorian Christian and was given name Nicholas. He arrived in the Ilkhanate sometime in 1260s with his mother Qutui and brother Tekshin. Years later, he was granted governorship of Nahavand and Dinavar by Abaqa, who respected his mother Qutui. Qutui was also invested with territories with income of 100.000 gold coins near Mayyafariqin by Abaqa.  Conversion to Islam  The circumstances of Tekuder's conversion to Islam are unknown. However, according to Ibn al-Fuwati he had been given information about his religious mentor and perhaps the person responsible for Tekuder's conversion - Kamal al-Din Abd ul-Rahman. He was described as a Greek slave of al-Mu'tasim Billah, who rose in rank thanks to his skills at alchemy and met Abaqa to whom he was introduced by Aybak. Abd ul-Rahman was introduced to Tekuder later by his mother Qutui Khatun. Tekuder sometime later converted to IslamSteven Runciman.

While Abd ul-Rahman would later rise in court and eventually be an ambassador to Mamluk Egypt. Arghun and Tekuder.  Election and reign  He arrived from Kurdistan to the Jaghatu valley near Maragha to attend the qurultai for the election of new Il- Khan after Abaqa's death in April 1282. The main competition was between his nephew Arghun, his brother M√∂ngke-Tem√ºr, and himself. He was supported by most of the nobles and emirs, including Jalairs such as Shiktur Noyan, Suqunjaq Noyan and the Khongirads. He was elected on 6 May 1282 and enthroned on 21 June 1282 at Aladagh (), east of lake Van. He adopted his Muslim name Ahmed as his regnal name. His first act was to clear Ata-Malik Juvayni of charges brought against him by Majd al-Mulk Yazdi, a vizier who accused him of embezzling state funds. Tekuder restored him to the government of Baghdad, while people lynched Majd al-Mulk for witchcraft. He also appointed his younger half-brother, Qonqurtai, as viceroy of Anatolia the following month. However Arghun believed that the Juvayni brothers were responsible for his father's death by poisoning. He came to Baghdad to spend the winter of 1282-1283 and restarted the investigation of the accusations of embezzlement which may have caused Ata Malik's stroke on 5 March 1283. = Rivalry with Arghun = As Arghun's dissatisfaction grew, he left for Khorasan in spring to gain the allegiance of minor nobles and amirs. Tekuder on the other hand began to be suspicious of his half-brother Qonqurtai and Arghun's potential alliance. Qonqurtai was accused of conspiracy and was arrested by Tekuder's son-in-law, Alinaq - the viceroy of Georgia - on 17 January 1284, and was executed the next day. An army contingent was sent to Jazira, from where Gaykhatu and Baydu fled to Khorasan, to Arghun's encampment while several emirs such as Taghachar and Doladai were arrested. His next step was to send Alinaq with 15,000 men against Arghun, while he himself followed Alinaq on 26 April with his main army composed of Armenians and Georgians in addition to Mongols stationed in Mughan plain near Bilasuvar. Arghun prevailed against Alinaq in battle on 4 May, south of Qazvin, but nevertheless retreated to his lands in Khorasan. Ala ud-Daula Simnani, future sufi saint of Kubrawiya order also fought in Arghun's army during this battle. Arghun tried negotiate a truce, which Ahmad, against the advice of his councillors, refused. Another embassy sent by Arghun, this time led by his son Ghazan arrived at Tekuder's camp near Semnan on 31 May. The embassy was a success, as Ahmad accepted a truce on the condition that Arghun send his brother Gaykhatu as a hostage. Arghun agreed to the terms and sent his brother accompanied by two amirs, including Nawruz into the custody of Buqa, then the most senior of Tekuder's commanders, on 13 or 28 June. Buqa in turn handed him over to Ahmad who put Gaykhatu in T√∂dai Khatun's encampment. Despite this, Tekuder continued hostilities and continued to advance on Arghun. This caused Buqa to harbour resentment towards Tekuder and to grow more sympathetic to Arghun. On the other hand, he lost the favour of Tekuder who started to invest his trust in Aq Buqa, another Jalair general. Arghun's next step was to seek refuge in Kalat-e Naderi, a strong fortress on 7 July with 100 men. But he was forced to surrender to Alinaq four days later. Victorious, Tekuder left Arghun in Alinaq's custody while he himself left for Kalpush, where his main army was stationed. This was the opportunity Buqa was seeking - he broke into Alinaq's camp and set Arghun free, while killing Alinaq. Tekuder fled west and looted Buqa's encampment near Sultaniya in revenge. He continued on to his own pasturelands near Takht-i Suleyman on 17 July planning to escape to the Golden Horde via Derbent. However, Qaraunas, who had been sent by Buqa, soon caught up with and arrested Tekuder. He was turned over to Arghun on 26 July on the Ab-i Shur pasturelands, near Maragha.  Trial and death  Tekuder was accused of the unjust execution of Qonqurtai, his half-brother in a trial presided over by Arghun. While Tekuder asked for mercy and clemency, Qonqurtai's Chinese (or Khitan) mother Ajuja demanded his execution. While not in favour of execution, the rebellions of his uncle Hulachu and cousin Jushkab in Hamadan forced him decide in favour of Qonqurtai's family. They had Ahmed executed on 10 August 1284 by breaking his back. Tekuder and Shams al-Din Juvayni.  Relations with Mamluks  Shams al-Din Juvayni advised him to make peace with Mamluk Egypt since he was a Muslim sultan. The first embassy headed by Qutb al-Din Shirazi left Aladagh for Egypt on 25 August 1282. He expressed his aim to forge an alliance with Qalawun against the wishes of his own council in a letter. Qalawun sent a reply on 3 December 1282 urging Tekuder to release the Sultanate of Rum from vassalage as a fellow Muslim. Tekuder sent a second embassy, headed by his religious mentor Kamal al-Din Abd ul-Rahman to Egypt from Tabriz in June 1283. However, this embassy was late as it arrived on 2 March 1284 and was granted audience on 26 August 1284, 16 days after Tekuder's death. Which led to envoy's arrest and death. When Arghun received no reply, he declared war against Tekuder. Tekuder requested help from the Mamluk Sultan, but the Mamluks did not fully co-operate with him. Having a small and inferior army, Tekuder was defeated by Arghun's larger force, and he was eventually executed on August 10, 1284. Shams al-Din Juvayni was also arrested and executed by Buqa on 16 October 1284.

Garai is part of the comarca of Durangaldea and has a population of 318 inhabitants as of 2009 according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.  Toponymy  The complete name of the elizate was San Miguel de Garay, but the municipality was named just \\"Garay\\". The name may have two different origins; one due its geographical location, as Garai is located in the upper area of Durangaldea and garai is the Basque word for \\"upper\\" or \\"the upper part\\"; but also, the name might be related to the h√≥rreos, very common in this area of Biscay and that have the Basque name of garaidxe. Then, San Miguel de Garay could be translated as \\"San Miguel of the upper part\\" of \\"San Miguel of the h√≥rreos\\". Traditionally, the name of the town has been written as \\"Garay\\", but according to the new orthographic rules of the Basque language, the correct spelling is \\"Garai\\". In the 1990s, the town hall changed the official denomination from Garay to Garai.  History  As happens with most of the elizates, the origin and date of foundation of the town is unknown. As a member of the ancient merindad of Durango, it had voice and right to vote in the Juntas of Guerendiaga, where it occupied the seat number six. The town was divided into two neighborhoods and it was focused on farming activities; production of corn, wheat, several sorts of vegetables, legumes, cherries, apples and chestnuts. In the oldest part of the town is located a small palace-baserri named Garatikua and built by Juan de Garay, governor of Paraguay. In the 19th century, it was called \\"Garay-Goitia\\". On May 1, 1966, the terrorist-separatist organization ETA occupied the town for several hours in one of its first official actions. The telephone lines were shut down, several graffities were made and the Ikurri√±a (by that time, illegal) was set on a visible part of the town. The command abandoned the town before the arriving of the Civil Guard.  Geography  Garai is located in the eastern part of the province of Biscay, in the comarca of Durangaldea, northern Spain. It has an extension of 7,12 km¬≤. It limits at north and east with Berriz, at south with Abadi√±o and at west with Iurreta.

The duo began in stand up comedy, and first came together when they teamed up for what was intended to be a one-off comedy show in 1996. They are best known for their syndicated radio programs, TV shows, stand up comedy tours, comedy DVDs and books. Radio Merrick and Rosso first came to prominence performing a weekly guest spot on the drive- time program on Triple J radio in 1998. They became full-time presenters for that segment for the next two years; regulars on their show included Myf Warhurst and Peter Helliar. In 2001, they moved to newly launched commercial radio station Nova 96.9 for the breakfast radio shift (6am to 9am). They remained in this time slot from the station's launch until the show's end. Sami Lukis at one time served as a co-host until she moved to Brisbane at the end of 2007. In 2008, actress Kate Ritchie began to co-host the show. In 2009, previous co-host Lukis started co-hosting a breakfast program on Triple M in Sydney, directly competing with Merrick and Rosso. On 10 November 2009, Ross announced his impending departure from the Merrick, Rosso & Kate breakfast show. Ritchie also announced her departure from the show, while Watts planned to continue on radio. Ross's departure ended an 11-year radio partnership with Watts. Merrick and Rosso's final radio show as a duo on Nova 969 took place on 4 December 2009. Tributes were paid to them by comedians including Peter Helliar and Judith Lucy, as well as celebrities such as Tom Williams and Ray Hadley. Snippets of the duo's favourite prank calls were played, as well as an audio montage of highlights from the past nine years. Television Their first foray into television was a short-lived pay TV show, Planet Merrick and Rosso (later known as Super Planet Merrick and Rosso) on The Comedy Channel. In 2003 their television show Merrick and Rosso Unplanned debuted on the Nine Network, based on the antiformat established by Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned in the UK. It featured comedy, chat and audience interaction which ran for three seasons. In 2005, Merrick and Rosso starred in the television series The B Team on Network Ten. On 7 July 2007 they presented at Live Earth. Merrick Watts has also appeared in the comedy series The Hollowmen and Thank God You're Here.

He has also appeared as Marty Johnstone, a New Zealand drug dealer who was originally the leader of the Mr Asia drug syndicate in the hit series Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities.  The Merrick & Rosso Show  In 2008, Merrick and Rosso returned to Australia's Comedy Channel with an original format entitled The Merrick & Rosso Show. A mixture of sketches, stunts and parodies, often featuring the guest star, it quickly became the highest rating show in the channel's fifteen-year history. Guests throughout the first season were Ray Martin, Brendan Cowell, Kate Ritchie, The Veronicas, Stephen Curry, Ian Thorpe, Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald, Peter Helliar, Hugh Jackman, Dicko and Judith Lucy. One popular sketch that picked up a following on YouTube and FunnyorDie was 'The Almost Transformers' which featured the stars disguised as a fridge and a washing machine for the purpose of terrifying shoppers. Another stunt included adopting an entire village in PNG (a popular trend amongst Hollywood celebrities) and renaming it Merrick & Rosso Land, distributing T-shirts bearing slogans such as \\"Sorry Madonna, I'm Taken\\", \\"Angelina Rejected Me\\" and \\"Property of Merrick And Rosso\\". Guests for the second series included Will Ferrell, The Wiggles, Ed Phillips, Tommy Williams, Magda Szubanski, Bob Evans, Eskimo Joe, David Wenham, Asher Keddie, Charlotte Dawson and Alex Perry, Antonia Kidman and cricketer Stuart MacGill. The show also created the anti-testimonial, where big-name celebrity guests who came into the Nova studios were given (often scripted) material and invited to explain why they could not or did not want to appear on the TV show. Anti-Testimonials were given by Will Smith, Lily Allen, Russell Brand, Chris Rock, Ryan Reynolds, Kelly Clarkson, Rhys Darby, Seth Rogen, Macy Gray, Eric Hutchinson and Cesar Millan.

Overview A large proportion of the economy of the United States and its labour market falls within corporate control.\\"Statistics about Business Size (including Small Business)\\". from the United States Census Bureau. In the developed world, corporations dominate the marketplace, comprising 50% or more of all businesses. Those businesses which are not corporations contain the same bureaucratic structure of corporations, but there is usually a sole owner or group of owners who are liable to bankruptcy and criminal charges relating to their business. Corporations have limited liability and remain less regulated and accountable than sole proprietorships. Corporations are usually called public entities or publicly traded entities when parts of their business can be bought in the form of shares on the stock market. This is done as a way of raising capital to finance the investments of the corporation. The shareholders appoint the executives of the corporation, who are the ones running the corporation via a hierarchical chain of power, where the bulk of investor decisions are made at the top and have effects on those beneath them. =Corporate power= Corporate capitalism has been criticized for the amount of power and influence corporations and large business interest groups have over government policy, including the policies of regulatory agencies and influencing political campaigns (see corporate welfare). Many social scientists have criticized corporations for failing to act in the interests of the people, and their existence seems to circumvent the principles of democracy, which assumes equal power relations between individuals in a society.Bakan, Joel (writer). \\"The Corporation (2003)\\" (documentary).

The tree only occurs in Africa and is the only species in genus Colophospermum. Its distinctive butterfly-shaped (bifoliate) leaf and thin seed pod make it easy to identify. In terms of human use it is, together with camel thorn and leadwood, one of the three regionally important firewood trees. Range and habit It is native to Southern Africa, including Southern Angola, Zambia, Southern Malawi, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Northern South Africa. It grows in alkaline (high lime content) soils which are shallow and not well drained. It also grows in alluvial soils (soil deposited by rivers). Where it occurs, it is often the dominant tree species, frequently forming homogeneous stands. In Northern South Africa and larger adjacent areas of Botswana and Zimbabwe, the trees tend to vary between , often called \\"mopane scrub\\" (shrub) but also sometimes taller and forming woodland. Further north the trees are taller and form tall woodlands referred to as cathedral mopane. This tree does not grow well outside hot, frost-free areas with summer rainfall. =Mopane ecoregions= There are two ecoregions where mopane is the predominant vegetation. The Angolan mopane woodlands are in southwestern Angola and northern Namibia, and the Zambezian and mopane woodlands extend over the lowlands of the Zambezi River and its tributaries in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, and Swaziland.  Uses  Mopane worm on a mopane branch. Immediately below the caterpillar, a pair of distinctive, butterfly-shaped leaves have survived. Butterfly-shaped leaf of the Mopane tree Mopane wood is one of southern Africa's heaviest and is difficult to work because of its hardness.The Wood Database Mopane. Retrieved 24 June 2013. However, this also makes it termite resistant. For this reason it has long been used for building houses and fences, as railway sleepers and as pit props. The termite-resistance and rich, reddish colouring also make it popular for flooring. Outside Africa, mopane is gaining popularity as a heavy, decorative wood, its uses including aquarium ornaments, bases for lamps or sculptures, and garden accents. Mopane in Namibia It is also increasingly being used in the construction of musical instruments, particularly woodwind. Suitable quality African blackwood (Dalbergia melanoxylon), traditionally used for clarinets, is becoming harder to find. Mopane is fairly oily, seasons very well with few splits or shakes, and produces instruments of a warm, rich tone.Prosono International Woods for woodwinds. Retrieved 23 April 2010. Mopane twigs have been traditionally used as tooth brushes, bark to make twine and for tanning, and leaves for healing wounds. The wood is also used to make charcoal and for braai wood. The tree is a major food source for the mopane worm, the caterpillar of the moth Gonimbrasia belina. The caterpillars are rich in protein and are eaten by people. The mopane worm is also rich in crude fats and contains vitamins and minerals such as iron, calcuim and phosphorus. The tree also acts as a foodplant for a wild silk moth, Gonometa rufobrunnea. Cocoons of the moth are harvested as wild silk, to make cloth. Mopane worm creates employment and serve as a source of income for the majority of rural women. Harvesters sell it in villages, towns or to the trader The mopane tree also serves as a host plant for the mopane psyllid Retroacizzia mopani.Oppong, C.K., Addo-Bediako, A., Potgieter, M.J. & Wessels, D.C.J. 2009.

It had locations in the New York City neighborhoods of Hell's Kitchen and the East Village and currently operates theaters in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Hollywood and Sunset Boulevard. UCB was located in Chelsea West 26th St location from April 2003 until November 2017. After which the theatre moved to Hell's Kitchen, 555 West 42nd St in December 2017. The second theatre located in the East Village opened in 2011 and the Los Angeles expansion started in 2014. The troupe was originally trained by Del Close at Chicago's ImprovOlympic, invented the ASSSSCAT show the success of which led to the troupe getting their own sketch show on Comedy Central from 1998 to 2000, and eventually founded their own theatre. In 2013, they co-authored a manual The Upright Citizens Brigade Comedy Improvisation Manual.Get the Laughs, but Follow the Rules, The New York Times, 20 February 2014 Philosophy The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre Training Center teaches longform improv, sketch, writing, parts of directing and various other comedy skills. The training center's philosophy of improv is based largely on the teachings of Del Close, with a strong emphasis on the \\"game\\" of the scene. The primary improvisational form is \\"The Harold\\", and the theater in all its incarnations has had a group of \\"Harold Teams\\", house teams that perform regularly. History =New York= Prior to opening their own theatre, the Upright Citizens Brigade performed their signature improv show, ASSSSCAT, first at KGB Bar, and then later at Solo Arts. Solo Arts was the first semi- permanent home to the Upright Citizens Brigade's Harold Teams and is considered by some to be the group's first theatre. The troupe's first permanent space was at 161 West 22nd Street, a 75-seat auditorium that used to be the Harmony Burlesque Theater, an all-nude lap-dancing club‚Äîessentially a storefront. The original theatre was closed on November 18, 2002, after a building inspector ordered the theater to be shut down due to fire code violations. In the months that followed, the theater found a temporary home at the Access Theater on lower Broadway, then moved to the Chelsea Playhouse for a short time before finding a permanent space. On April 1, 2003, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre moved to its second official space in Chelsea - a 150-seat theater at 307 West 26th Street in NYC in the former Maverick Theater. The new venue had several advantages over the previous theater on West 22nd, such as double capacity, a more professional tech booth, larger green room with a greater separation from the stage area, two dressing rooms, storage rooms, twice the number of bathrooms, and a \\"chill out room\\". In September 2011, UCB opened a second theater on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, at 153 E 3rd St. This theater features 124 seats, two lobbies, and a full bar known as the \\"Hot Chicks Room\\" in reference to an episode of the Upright Citizens Brigade TV show. Often referred to as \\"Beast\\", the theater was initially opened in hopes of showcasing more stand-up comedy. However, it primarily featured improv and sketch shows. In January 2019 it was announced that UCB East would close in February 2019, following financial issues. At the start of 2017, ticket prices increased (the first in ten years). In October 2017, it was announced that the UCB Chelsea location would close. The last show in Chelsea was Wednesday, November 28, 2017. The next UCB space was at 555 42nd St in Hell's Kitchen, the former home to the Pearl Theatre Company. This location and the New York training center were closed on Tuesday, April 21, 2020, leaving no current NYC locations of UCB. =UCB LA= In 2005, with Daisy Rosario as general manager, the Los Angeles branch of the theater opened at 5919 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood, offering up improv, sketch and stand-up comedy shows nightly with a 120-seat capacity. Soon after, Comedy Bang! Bang! (formerly Comedy Death-Ray), a Los Angeles alternative comedy show moved from its former home at the M Bar to join the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, appearing on Tuesday nights. In 2014, UCB announced the opening of UCB Theatre Sunset located at 5419 Sunset Boulevard for November 1. The new venue plays home to Upright Citizens Brigade's training center, an 85-seat theatre, cafe/performance space called Inner Sanctum, video production offices, and even retail stores on street level.

Ferrite beads employ high-frequency current dissipation in a ferrite ceramic to build high-frequency noise suppression devices.  Use  A ferrite bead with its plastic shell removed Ferrite beads prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI) in two directions: from a device or to a device. A conductive cable acts as an antenna ‚Äì if the device produces radio-frequency energy, this can be transmitted through the cable, which acts as an unintentional radiator. In this case the bead is required for regulatory compliance, to reduce EMI. Conversely, if there are other sources of EMI, such as household appliances, the bead prevents the cable from acting as an antenna and receiving interference from these other devices. This is particularly common on data cables and on medical equipment. Large ferrite beads are commonly seen on external cabling. Various smaller ferrite beads are used internally in circuits‚Äîon conductors or around the pins of small circuit-board components, such as transistors, connectors and integrated circuits. On wires intended to be DC conductors, beads can block low level unintended radio frequency energy by acting as a low pass filter. On unbalanced coax transmission lines (for instance, USB cables and video cables) the cable is designed to contain the signal, and beads can be used to block stray common mode current from using the cable as an antenna while not interfering with the signal carried inside the cable. In this use, the bead is a simple form of a balun. Ferrite beads are one of the simplest and least expensive types of interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple ferrite ring, the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. (Note, however, that although each loop increases the impedance to high frequencies, it also shifts the frequency of the highest impedance to a lower frequency.) Small ferrite beads can be slipped over component leads to suppress parasitic oscillation. Surface-mount ferrite beads are available. These are soldered into a gap in the printed circuit board trace, just like any other surface-mount inductor. Inside the bead component, a coil of wire runs between layers of ferrite to form a multi-turn inductor around the high-permeability core.Ferrite Bead Inductors ‚Äì Electronics Notes  Theory of operation  An RF inductor wound on a ferrite core (not a ferrite bead), and a PCB mount ferrite bead Ferrite beads are used as a passive low-pass filter, by converting RF energy to heat, by design. (Contrast this with inductors, which by design minimize conversion of RF energy to heat, offering a high impedance to RF.) The geometry and electromagnetic properties of coiled wire over the ferrite bead result in an impedance for high-frequency signals, attenuating high-frequency EMI/RFI electronic noise. The energy is either reflected back up the cable, or dissipated as low-level heat. Only in extreme cases is the heat noticeable. A pure inductor does not dissipate energy but it produces reactance that impedes the flow of higher frequency signals. This reactance is commonly referred to simply as impedance, although impedance can be any combination of resistance and reactance. A collection of snap-on/clamp-on ferrite beads A ferrite bead can be added to an inductor to improve, in two ways, its ability to block unwanted high frequency noise. First, the ferrite concentrates the magnetic field, increasing inductance and therefore reactance, which impedes or ‚Äòfilters out‚Äô the noise. Second, if the ferrite is so designed, it can produce an additional loss in the form of resistance in the ferrite itself. The ferrite creates an inductor with a very low Q factor. This loss heats the ferrite, normally by a negligible amount. While the signal level is large enough to cause interference or undesirable effects in sensitive circuits, the energy blocked is typically quite small. Depending on the application, the resistive loss characteristic of the ferrite may or may not be desired. A design that uses a ferrite bead to improve noise filtering must take into account specific circuit characteristics and the frequency range to block. Different ferrite materials have different properties with respect to frequency, and manufacturer's literature helps select the most effective material for the frequency range. Typically the material used in the beads is powdered ferrite, with the mix of grain sizes adjusted to control the range of frequencies absorbed or blocked and minimize magnetic field storage. Contrast this with inductors and transformers, which use solid or laminated iron or copper cores to store magnetic fields and maximize energy transfer.

Biography Commerson was born at Ch√¢tillon-les-Dombes in France. He studied in Montpellier, and for a time was a practicing physician. He was in contact with Carl Linnaeus, who encouraged him to study fish of the Mediterranean. Commerson returned to live at Ch√¢tillon-les-Dombes, where he occupied himself in creating a botanical garden in 1758. After the death of his wife in 1764, he moved to Paris. In 1766, Commerson joined Bougainville on his voyage of circumnavigation after being recommended for the position of naturalist by the Paris Academy of Sciences. He had previously drawn up an extensive programme of nature studies for the Marine Ministry, in which he elaborated the \\"three natural kingdoms\\" which a naturalist should investigate on a voyage around the world. Among the wildlife that Commerson observed was a particular kind of dolphin in the Strait of Magellan, now known as Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii). Commerson's partner and assistant, Jeanne Bar√© (also referred to Jeanne Baret), accompanied him on the voyage, disguised as a man. Bar√© acted as a nurse to Commerson, who was often ill, as well as assisting him in his scientific work. Her gender was only publicly discovered while the expedition was at Tahiti, but she remained with Commerson, nursing him and assisting him in his professional activities until the end of his life. Commerson was an astute observer of the Tahitian people and culture, thanks in part to a remarkable lack of European prejudice compared to other early visitors to the island. Commerson and Bougainville together were responsible for spreading the myth of Tahitians as the embodiment of the concept of the noble savage. Commerson also studied and collected plants wherever the expedition stopped; among others, he described the genus Bougainvillea. On the return voyage to France in 1768, he remained behind at Mauritius (the then-French Isle de France), in order to botanize there and on Madagascar, an island that fascinated him. Pierre Sonnerat, who would also become a renowned botanist, was his personal secretary on the Isle de France. Death and legacy Commerson died at Mauritius at the age of 45. His extensive collections from the voyage did not, unfortunately, receive their deserved recognition. Although his numerous manuscripts and herbaria were brought to Paris after his death they were never systematically organized and evaluated. Unaware of his death in 1773, the Paris Academy of Sciences elected him as a fellow botanist just a few months later.

She had a dominant stage presence and played a wide range of powerful characters. She is best remembered for her performance as Miss Havisham in David Lean's Great Expectations. Biography =Early life= Hunt was born in Buenos Aires on 30 January 1900Roy, Donald (2004). \\"Hunt, Martita (1900‚Äì1969)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. to English parents Alfred and Marta (n√©e Burnett) Hunt. She spent the first 20 years of her life in Argentina before she returned with her parents to the United Kingdom to attend Queenwood Ladies' College in Eastbourne and then to train as an actress. =Early theatrical career= Hunt began her acting career in repertory theatre at Liverpool before moving to London. She first appeared there in the Stage Society's production of Ernst Toller's The Machine Wreckers at the Kingsway Theatre in May 1923. From 1923 to 1929, she appeared as the Principessa della Cercola in W. Somerset Maugham's Our Betters (Globe, 1924) and as Mrs. Linde in Ibsen's A Doll's House (Playhouse, 1925) in the West End, along with engagements at club theatres such as the Q Theatre and the Arts Theatre and a short 1926 Chekhov season at the small Barnes Theatre under Theodore Komisarjevsky (playing Charlotta Ivanovna, in The Cherry Orchard and Olga in Three Sisters). In September 1929, she joined the Old Vic company, then led by Harcourt Williams, and, during the following eight months played B√©line in Moli√®re's The Imaginary Invalid, Queen Elizabeth in George Bernard Shaw's The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, and Lavinia in Shaw's Androcles and the Lion. However, her time there was more noted for a succession of Shakespearean roles: the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet, Portia in The Merchant of Venice, the Queen in Richard II, Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Portia in Julius Caesar), including roles with John Gielgud (Rosalind in As You Like It, Lady Macbeth in Macbeth, and Gertrude in Hamlet). In Hunt's entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Donald Roy wrote: > \\"With an arresting appearance and a dominant stage presence, she proved most > effective as strong, tragic characters, her Gertrude in Hamlet being > accounted by some critics the finest they had seen.\\" She then returned to the West End (briefly returning to the Old Vic to play Emilia in the 1938 Othello), notably playing Edith Gunter in Dodie Smith's Autumn Crocus (Lyric, 1931), the Countess of Rousillon in All's Well That Ends Well (Arts, 1932), Lady Strawholme in Ivor Novello's Fresh Fields (Criterion, 1933), Liz Frobisher in John Van Druten's The Distaff Side (Apollo, 1933), Barbara Dawe in Clemence Dane's Moonlight Is Silver (Queen's, 1934), Theodora in Elmer Rice's Not for Children (Fortune, 1935), Masha in Chekhov's The Seagull (New Theatre, 1936), the Mother in an English-language version of Garc√≠a Lorca's Bodas de sangre (\\"Marriage of Blood\\"; Savoy, 1939), L√©onie in Jean Cocteau's Les Parents Terribles (Gate, 1940), Mrs Cheveley in Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband (Westminster, 1943), and Cornelia in John Webster's The White Devil (Duchess, 1947). =Early film career= Hunt also appeared in many supporting roles in several popular British films such as Good Morning, Boys (1937), Trouble Brewing (1939), and The Man in Grey (1943). The Wicked Lady (1945) was an international success, but her next film role in David Lean's Great Expectations (1946) would be her most famous and most lauded. As Miss Havisham, she reprised her role from the 1939 stage adaptation by Alec Guinness which provided the inspiration and template for Lean's film. Her performance met with significant acclaim, and Roger Ebert later wrote in 1999 that she \\"dominate[d] the [film's] early scenes, playing Miss Havisham as a beak-nosed, shabby figure, bedecked in crumbling lace and linen, not undernourished despite her long exile.\\"Review of Great Expectations, Chicago Sun-Times. Retrieved 10 December 2014. =Later career= From this time on, she divided her time between British and American films as well as the stage. She won a Tony Award in 1949 for her Broadway d√©but as Countess Aurelia in the English-speaking premi√®re of Giraudoux's The Madwoman of Chaillot (though she had relatively less impact on the production's 1952 tour). Her last stage role was as Ang√©lique Boniface in Hotel Paradiso, an adaptation from Feydeau, again with Guinness at the Winter Garden Theatre in May 1956. Other films in which she appeared include: Anna Karenina (1948), The Fan (1949), Anastasia (1956), Three Men in a Boat (1956), The Admirable Crichton (1957), The Brides of Dracula (1960), The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962), Becket (1964), The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964) and Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965). She also appeared on TV as Lady Bastable in several adaptations of the Saki stories (1962) =Death= Martita Hunt died of bronchial asthma at her home in Hampstead, London, aged 69, on 13 June 1969. Her estate was valued at ¬£5,390. She never married. She was an aunt of actor Gareth Hunt. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 19 June and her ashes lie in the Ivor Novello Rose Bed.

He is currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) as a senior producer. He is best known for his time with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He is also known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as a wrestler and a road agent and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Although never a world champion, Malenko achieved championship success in ECW, WCW and the WWF, winning 11 total titles between the three organizations. Pro Wrestling Illustrated named Malenko the #1 wrestler in the world in 1997, and he was inducted into the Hardcore Hall of Fame in 2015. Five-time WWE world champion Daniel Bryan said that his \\"number one guy, growing up, was Dean Malenko\\". Following his retirement, he worked as a road agent for WWE for 18 years from 2001 until 2019. Professional wrestling career =Florida independent circuit (1979‚Äì1994)= Malenko was born into a wrestling family, and his father Boris Malenko was a prominent wrestling figure. He started out as a referee in the Tampa area and even worked briefly as a referee for the WWF in the mid-1980s. He has wrestled all over the world and has spent much time wrestling in Mexico and Japan. He wrestled with his brother Joe Malenko from 1988 to 1992, forming a tag team, until his brother retired. On January 24, 1992, Malenko defeated \\"The Superstar\\" for the Suncoast Pro Wrestling (SPW) Southern title in Palmetto, Florida. Malenko defeated Jimmy Backlund for the ICWA Light Heavyweight title on March 12, 1992, in Tampa. =NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling = The Shooter (1994) In 1994, Malenko joined Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) on August 27, 1994, as a heel participating in a professional wrestling tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He defeated Osamu Nishimura in the quarterfinals before he ended up losing to the eventual winner Shane Douglas in the semifinals. Malenko became known as \\"The Shooter\\" and was given a gimmick similar to an Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter (due to his resemblance to Royce Gracie). On November 4, 1994, he defeated 2 Cold Scorpio to win his first ECW Television Championship. Triple Threat and feud with Eddie Guerrero (1995) In the beginning of 1995, Malenko formed a faction called the Triple Threat with Chris Benoit and Shane Douglas. On February 25, 1995, Benoit and Malenko defeated Sabu and Tazmaniac for the ECW Tag Team Championship, making Malenko a double champion. A month later, Malenko dropped the Television title to 2 Cold Scorpio. On April 8 at Three Way Dance, he and Benoit lost the tag titles to The Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock). In the summer of 1995, Malenko feuded with TV Champion Eddie Guerrero, culminating in a match on July 21 where Malenko defeated Guerrero to win his second ECW Television Championship. Only a week later, Malenko dropped the title back to Guerrero. The two continued to battle over the Television Title and fought a series of matches that led to them being offered a WCW contract. His last ECW match was a two out of three falls match against Guerrero, which took place on August 26. The match ended in a draw as the last fall had both men's shoulders on the mat. This would be both men's last match in ECW and they both gave‚Äîand received‚Äîan emotional farewell to the fans. =World Championship Wrestling= Cruiserweight Champion and United States Heavyweight Champion (1995‚Äì1998) In September 1995, Malenko and Benoit joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he continued to be a villain. Malenko came to be known in WCW as \\"The Iceman\\" Dean Malenko because of his cold, calculating demeanor and was also given the nickname of \\"The Man of 1,000 Holds\\". On May 2, 1996, Malenko defeated Shinjiro Otani for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship in Orlando. He held the title for two months, making successful defenses against the likes of Brad Armstrong, Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Disco Inferno before losing the title to Mysterio on the July, 8 edition of Nitro. He defeated Mysterio Jr. for his second WCW Cruiserweight Championship at Halloween Havoc 1996. After a successful title defense against Psychosis at World War 3 (1996), Malenko lost the Cruiserweight title to Ultimate Dragon (√öltimo Drag√≥n) at Starrcade 1996 where Drag√≥n's J-Crown Championship was also on the line. Malenko defeated Drag√≥n on the January 22, 1997 Clash of the Champions XXXIV to win his third WCW Cruiserweight Championship. He would hold the belt for nearly a month before losing it to Syxx at SuperBrawl VII. Malenko lost the match after Eddie Guerrero inadvertently caused Malenko to be hit with Guerrero's United States Title belt.http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/superbrawl.htm Malenko then entered a feud with Guerrero, angry over the fact that he had caused him to lose his Cruiserweight belt, and began to attempt to win the United States title from him. The match between the two took place at Uncensored the next month and interference from Syxx played a role again. The Cruiserweight Champion again tried to take Guerrero's title, but in the process dropped the camcorder he carried to the ring with him. After Guerrero took the belt back, Malenko hit him in the back of the head with the camcorder and knocked the champion out, enabling him to pin Guerrero and win his first United States Championship. He retained the belt at Slamboree on May 18, 1997 by defeating Jeff Jarrett, but lost the title to him on the June 9, 1997 episode of Nitro. At World War 3, Malenko participated in a 60-man, three-ring battle royal won by The Giant. At Starrcade 1997, he challenged Guerrero for the Cruiserweight Title but ended up losing the match. In mid-1998, Malenko engaged in a heated feud with Chris Jericho. To better Malenko's claims, Jericho boasted that he was \\"The Man of 1,004 Holds\\" and the two had a final showdown at Uncensored 1998 for the Cruiserweight title. After a long match, Jericho forced Malenko to submit in an angled Liontamer. After the match, the otherwise collected Malenko was left in an unusual fit of frustration. Gene Okerlund then confronted Malenko post match, aggressively citing his many losses in the past several months and asking where he would go from this point. Dejected and worn down, Malenko replied simply, \\"Home,\\" and would not be seen on WCW TV for two months. In the ensuing two months, Jericho proceeded to mercilessly taunt Malenko, including insulting Malenko's father and attacking Malenko's brother. At Slamboree 1998, Jericho held a Battle Royal for a shot at his Cruiserweight Championship. Malenko entered the battle royal dressed as masked wrestler Ciclope and won the match, after Juventud Guerrera shook his hand, and eliminated himself. He then unmasked, revealing himself to the crowd following his win. Malenko went on to defeat Jericho for his fourth and final WCW Cruiserweight Championship, thus becoming the first-ever wrestler to win the Cruiserweight title four times. Malenko was stripped of the title, however, as he did not earn the title shot as himself. At The Great American Bash 1998, Malenko and Jericho faced each other in a match for the vacant Cruiserweight title. Malenko lost by disqualification, making Jericho the champion. At Bash at the Beach 1998, Malenko interfered in Jericho's title defense against Rey Mysterio, Jr. allowing Mysterio to pin Jericho for the title. The title was returned to Jericho, however, because of interference by Malenko. Malenko was fired in storyline, but returned at Road Wild 1998 as the special guest referee during Jericho's defense against Juventud Guerrera. Juventud won the match and the title. The Four Horsemen and The Revolution (1998‚Äì2000) In September 1998, Malenko became a part of the final incarnation of Ric Flair's Four Horsemen faction. They feuded with the New World Order (nWo), particularly Eric Bischoff. Malenko and Benoit also battled The West Texas Rednecks (Curt Hennig and Barry Windham) during this period. At SuperBrawl IX, they lost to the Rednecks in the finals of a tag team tournament for the vacant World Tag Team Championship. At Uncensored 1999, however, they defeated the Rednecks in a lumberjack match to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Two weeks later, they lost the titles to Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Billy Kidman. After the Horsemen were finally disbanded in May 1999 due to Flair's abuse of power, Malenko joined up with Shane Douglas' faction, The Revolution, which was formed in July 1999. They feuded with David Flair, Diamond Dallas Page and Chris Kanyon. At Bash at the Beach (1999), Malenko challenged David for the US title but lost the match. They battled many teams throughout the year including West Texas Rednecks, First Family, The Filthy Animals and The Varsity Club. Malenko's last WCW match was a \\"catch-as-catch-can\\" match with Billy Kidman at Souled Out. Early on, Malenko instinctively left the ring to regroup and was disqualified under the match stipulations because his feet hit the arena floor. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE= The Radicalz and Light Heavyweight Champion (2000‚Äì2001) After being granted his release from WCW the night after his last WCW match, Malenko signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and debuted on January 31, 2000 edition of Raw Is War. Malenko first appeared in the crowd with the infamous Radicalz ‚Äì himself, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, and Perry Saturn ‚Äì who all made exits from WCW at the same time. While not having as much success in the WWF, Malenko was a force in the promotion's light heavyweight division. Along with Guerrero, Benoit, and Saturn, he had some measure of success as part of The Radicalz. On the March 13 edition of Raw Is War, Malenko defeated Essa Rios for his first Light Heavyweight Championship. In April 2000, he feuded with Scotty 2 Hotty who was the new challenger for his Light Heavyweight title. He dropped the title to Scotty on the April 17 edition of Raw Is War before he won his second WWF Light Heavyweight Championship from Scotty on the April 27 episode of SmackDown!. At Backlash 2000, Malenko successfully defended the title against Scotty, thus ending the feud between the two. Later that year, with Benoit having drifted away from the group, Malenko engaged in a feud with Guerrero and Saturn which stemmed from Guerrero's on-screen relationship with Chyna and a number of losses suffered when working as a tag team with Saturn. The feud led to a triple threat match at Judgment Day 2000 where Guerrero retained the WWF European Championship against both Malenko and Saturn. After a brief absence from TV, Malenko returned to reform The Radicalz with Guerrero, Benoit, and Saturn. Around this time, Malenko briefly became known as \\"Double Ho Seven\\", a parody of the fictional character, James Bond. The gimmick was born out of a match with The Godfather, who offered one of his female escorts to Malenko instead of wrestling him. Malenko gladly accepted his opponent's offer. As Double Ho Seven, Malenko competed for the affections of Lita and feuded with her tag team the Hardy Boyz. He even offered Lita a title match for his Light Heavyweight Championship, but under the condition that if she lost she would be obliged to go on a date with him. Lita accepted and almost caught Malenko by a few nearfalls throughout the match, but in the end lost the match by submitting to his signature Cloverleaf. Malenko's feud with the Hardy Boyz and Lita continued in early 2001, culminating with Lita pinning him (with some assistance from Matt Hardy) in a match on the February 19, 2001 edition of Raw Is War. He also briefly feuded with Jacqueline and Ivory, who were disgusted by his lecherous ways. A title feud with Crash Holly would begin after Crash interfered in a two-on-one intergender handicap match between Malenko, and both Jacqueline and Ivory, costing him the match. After both Guerrero and Benoit drifted away from the Radicalz, Malenko teamed with Saturn for a few weeks before quietly disappearing off television as the WCW/ECW Invasion storyline began in summer 2001. Retirement and occasional appearances (2001‚Äì2019) Malenko's third-last wrestling match took place at the 4th Annual Brian Pillman Memorial Show in August 2001, where he teamed with longtime friend Perry Saturn and defeated Raven and Justin Credible. That December, he defeated his student, Chad Collyer, by disqualification in the WWF farm promotion, the Heartland Wrestling Association. Malenko appeared in the ring along with other WWE alumni during a segment of the WWE Homecoming edition of Raw on October 3, 2005. His close friend Eddie Guerrero died on November 13, 2005 and Malenko made a special appearance on the November 14 edition of Raw alongside Chris Benoit. The following Friday on SmackDown!, Malenko once again appeared after a match between Chris Benoit and Triple H, and the three embraced. After the 2006 Royal Rumble, he was seen congratulating Rey Mysterio on his Rumble victory. At Vengeance 2007, he appeared in a backstage segment watching Chavo Guerrero. On the Chris Benoit memorial episode of Monday Night Raw, he talked about the life of Chris Benoit. He was very sad since two of his close friends, Eddie and Benoit, both died, but said he was happy that they were together again. On February 27, 2007, M√≠stico (later known in WWE as Sin Cara) defeated Malenko in a tryout dark match before a TV taping in San Jose, California. Malenko then appeared on the March 31, 2008 episode of Raw to join The Four Horsemen and other WWE superstars in a farewell tribute to Ric Flair. He made an appearance on the June 28, 2010 episode of Raw congratulating Ricky Steamboat on his DVD release. He and all the others in the ring were attacked by the Nexus. Malenko appeared along the rest of the WWE roster after the April 23, 2012 episode of Raw to celebrate John Cena's 35th birthday. In November 2015, Malenko was inducted into 2300 Arena Hardcore Hall of Fame. On the September 11, 2017 episode of Raw, Malenko made a brief backstage appearance alongside Jamie Noble, where the two were seen as possible choices by Raw Tag Team Champions Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose as their partners for an eight-man tag-team match, but were quickly dismissed. On the June 5, 2018 episode of Smackdown Live, Malenko appeared during the contract signing between AJ Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura. On April 26, 2019, Malenko and WWE ended their working relationship. This came after Malenko was a road agent for them for the previous 18 years. Pro Wrestling Insider would later report that he did not do anything wrong, WWE was just in the process of cycling out some of the older agents, due to the recent signings of multiple new agents. = All Elite Wrestling (2019‚Äìpresent) = On May 24, All Elite Wrestling (AEW) announced that Malenko has joined them as a senior producer. Personal life Simon is Jewish. He and his wife have three children. Their eldest, Larrisa, was born December 25, 1997. Simon had a heart attack in the latter half of 2010, but was back at work by Survivor Series on November 21. In November 2013, he was taken to a hospital and later sent home from a WWE European tour after suffering chest pains. At Starrcast III in August 2019, Simon revealed that he suffers from Parkinson's disease.

Proficient in classics; mathematics, he was a schoolmaster, headmaster and schoolkeeper, who wrote extensively on functional equations, number theory and approximation theory, but also on optics. His contribution to approximation theory is honoured in the designation Horner's method, in particular respect of a paper in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London for 1819. The modern invention of the zoetrope, under the name Daedaleum in 1834, has been attributed to him.EarlyCinema.com. EarlyCinema.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-11.Glossary ‚Äì Z. Wernernekes.de. Retrieved on 2011-10-11. Horner died comparatively young, before the establishment of specialist, regular scientific periodicals. So, the way others have written about him has tended to diverge, sometimes markedly, from his own prolific, if dispersed, record of publications and the contemporary reception of them. Family life The eldest son of the Rev. William Horner, a Wesleyan minister, Horner was born in Bristol. He was educated at Kingswood School, a Wesleyan foundation near Bristol, and at the age of sixteen became an assistant master there. In four years he rose to be headmaster (1806), but left in 1809, setting up his own school, The Classical Seminary, at Grosvenor Place, Bath, which he kept until he died there 22 September 1837. He and his wife Sarah (1787?‚Äì1864) had six daughters and two sons. One of the sons, another William Horner, continued to run the school. He, too, had a large family; the youngest were twins, Charles and Francis John Horner (1852‚Äì1887). Francis Horner matriculated at St. John's College, Cambridge in 1872, taking out a BA in 1876 and an MA in 1883. He became a lecturer in mathematics at the University in Sydney, where he died after only a few years - he had been advised to try a change of climate on account of tuberculosis. A longer association with Australia comes through the issue of Horner's daughter Mary, who retained the name \`Horner' through several generations. Mary's son Joseph Horner Fletcher, was a Methodist school headmaster in New Zealand and then Australia. Neville Horner Fletcher (1930‚Äì ), FTSE, FAA, is a physicist at the Australian National University. Note by another author: It seems that the recurrence of the name William may be causing some generational confusion here. Mary Horner, mentioned below, married Joseph Fletcher on 14 November 1822, at the school Kingswood. She could hardly have been less than 16 at the time, meaning she was born no later than 1806, at which time, if this date of birth is correct, Horner would have been only 20. And Mary's sister, Sarah Jane, was baptised on 5 June 1803 Computer printouts of Portsea Hampshire Wesleyan St Peter's Daniel Street, Christenings 1798-1837, Salt Lake City, Genealogical Society of Utah, 1977, film no, 883967, at which time Horner would have been a few days short of 17. Whilst none of these things is impossible, it seems more likely that Mary and Sarah Jane were this William George Horner's younger sisters, daughters of William Horner senior. On Horner's death in 1837, Sarah Horner lived with another daughter, Charlotte Augusta (1819?‚Äì1863; m. 1849), and son-in-law, John Harrison (1820?‚Äì1877), and their daughters, Charlotte Sarah (b. 1852) and Elizabeth Caroline (b. 1856), at 33, Grovesnor Place, Bath Horner's youngest brother, Joseph Horner, was also an assistant master at Kingswood School, but in 1834 matriculated as a mature student at Clare College, Cambridge, standing twelfth Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos in 1838 (the same year, John Thompson Exley, the son of W. G. Horner's associate Thomas Exley, stood twenty-third). Joseph Horner was a Fellow of Clare College and then vicar of Everton with Tetsworth from 1839 until his death in 1875. He, too, published in mathematics. Other brothers were Thomas Horner, who died young; John Horner, a Wesleyan minister in India; and James Horner, cabinet maker of Bath. According to Horner, John Horner was the first missionary to come out of Kingswood School: he translated Bel and the Dragon into Marathi and his son, Horner's nephew, again John Horner, was tutor to the children of servants in the Sovereign's Household. Physical sciences, optics Although Horner's article on the D√¶dalum (zoetrope) appeared in Philosophical Magazine only in January, 1834, he had published on Camera lucida as early as August, 1815. Mathematics Horner's name first appears in the list of solvers of the mathematical problems in The Ladies' Diary: or, Woman's Almanack for 1811, continuing in the successive annual issues until that for 1817. Up until the issue for 1816, he is listed as solving all but a few of the fifteen problems each year; several of his answers were printed, along with two problems he proposed. He also contributed to other departments of the Diary, not without distinction, reflecting the fact that he was known to be an all-rounder, competent in the classics as well as in mathematics. Horner was ever vigilant in his reading, as shown by his characteristic return to the Diary for 1821 in a discussion of the Prize Problem, where he reminds readers of an item in (Thomson's) Annals of Philosophy for 1817; several other problems in the Diary that year were solved by his youngest brother, Joseph. His record in The Gentleman's Diary: or, Mathematical Repository for this period is similar, including one of two published modes of proof in the volume for 1815 of a problem posed the previous year by Thomas Scurr (d. 1836), now dubbed the Butterfly theorem. Leaving the headmastership of Kingswood School would have given him more time for this work, while the appearance of his name in these publications, which were favoured by a network of mathematics teachers, would have helped publicize his own school. At this stage, Horner's efforts turned more to The Mathematical Repository, edited by Thomas Leybourn, but to contributing occasional articles, rather than the problem section, as well as to Annals of Philosophy, where Horner begins by responding to other contributors and works up to independent articles of his own; he has a careful style with acknowledgements and, more often than not, cannot resist adding further detail. Several contributions pave the way for, or are otherwise related to, his most celebrated mathematical paper, in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1819, which was read by title at the closing meeting for the session on 1 July 1819, with Davies Gilbert in the Chair. The article, with significant editorial notes by Thomas Stephens Davies, was reprinted as a commemorative tribute in The Ladies' Diary for 1838. The issue of The Gentleman's Diary for that year contains a short obituary notice. A careful analysis of this paper has appeared recently in Craig Smory≈Ñski's History of Mathematics: A Supplement. esp. Chap. 7 While a sequel was read before the Royal Society, publication was declined for Philosophical Transactions, having to await appearance in a sequence of parts in the first two volumes of The Mathematician in the mid-1840s, again largely at the instigation of T. S. Davies. However, Horner published on diverse topics in The Philosophical Magazine well into the 1830s. Davies mooted an edition of Horner's collected papers, but this project never came to fruition, partly on account of Davies' own early death. Contemporary reception Some idea of Horner's standing with his contemporaries is provided by exchanges in the issues of Annals of Philosophy for July and August, 1817. Thomas Thomson, in commending to an enquirer Euler's work on algebra, is under some impression that the English translation is by Horner. Horner writes promptly to correct this, supposing the translation to be the work of Peter Barlow. Thomson, a professor in Glasgow, might not have known that the translation, originally published as far back as 1789, was the work of Francis Horner MP, an Edinburgh native, who had died only that February. Peter Barlow and continued fractions When Peter Barlow wrote, in 1845, he remembered Davies, but not Horner, asking to borrow a book by Budan (both Davies and Horner were living in Bath at the time). Barlow also had a vague recollection that the material on approximations Horner sent him related to continued fractions, rather than what appeared in the Philosophical Transactions. Horner clearly held Barlow in high regard and it would have been natural for Horner to approach him to request both books and critical advice as Horner draws attention to Barlow's article in New Series of the Mathematical Repository and in his survey of approximation methods in the following volume of the Repository (bound up in 1819). The anonymous reviewer for The Monthly Review in the issue for December, 1820 writes that he has seen Horner's letter to Barlow and that the letter confirms that Horner already had his method of approximation at that date (1818). The methods of both Barlow and Horner use a nesting of expressions akin to continued fractions. Horner was aware of Lagrange's use of continued fractions at least through his reading of Bonnycastle's Algebra which is also mentioned in the survey article in the Repository. Horner may have rewritten his paper either under guidance or of his own volition, with an eye to publication in Philosophical Transactions. Horner goes on to write on the use of continued fractions in the summation of series in Annals of Philosophy in 1826 and on their use in improvements they yield in the solution of equations in Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature and the Arts running over into 1827; he explicitly cites work of Lagrange. Barlow's memory of events may have been confused by the appearance of this later work.

It is designed to allow a computer to boot from a CD-ROM. It was announced in November 1994 and first issued in January 1995 as a joint proposal by IBM and BIOS manufacturer Phoenix Technologies.  Etymology  According to legend, the El Torito CD/DVD extension to ISO 9660 gained its name because its design originated in an El Torito restaurant in Irvine, California (). This is supported by a claim by Jack Allweiss, founder of Future Domain Inc. who states that Future Domain helped establish the standard.http://jack.hoa.org/FDCStory/FDC148.php The initial two authors were Curtis Stevens, of Phoenix Technologies, and Stan Merkin, of IBM.  Boot modes  According to the El Torito specification, a 32-bit CPU PC BIOS will search for boot code on an ISO 9660 CD-ROM. The standard allows for booting in two different modes. Either in hard disk emulation when the boot information can be accessed directly from the CD media, or in floppy emulation mode where the boot information is stored in an image file of a floppy disk, which is loaded from the CD and then behaves as a virtual floppy disk. This is useful for computers built before about 1999, which were designed to boot only from floppy drive. For modern computers the \\"no emulation\\" mode is generally the more reliable method. The BIOS will assign a BIOS drive number to the CD drive. The drive number (for INT 13h) assigned is any of 80hex (hard disk emulation), 00hex (floppy disk emulation) or an arbitrary number if the BIOS should not provide emulation. Emulation allows older operating systems to be booted from a CD, by making it appear to them as if they were booted from a hard or floppy disk. El Torito can also be used to produce CDs which can boot up Linux operating systems, by including the GRUB bootloader on the CD and following the Multiboot Specification. While the El Torito spec alludes to a \\"Mac\\" platform ID, PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh computers don't use it.

He played 63 Tests for Ireland including eleven as captain, and toured with the Lions five times ‚Äî a record that gave him 17 Lions Test caps. He also captained the most successful ever Lions side, which toured South Africa in 1974. Youth McBride was born at Toomebridge, County Antrim. Owing to his father's death when he was five years old, he spent most of his spare time helping out on his family farm. Because of this he did not start playing rugby until he was 17. He was educated at Ballymena Academy and played for the school's First XV. After he left he joined Ballymena R.F.C.. Playing career In 1962 was selected to play for Ireland. His first Test on 10 February 1962 was against England at Twickenham. Later that year he was selected to tour South Africa with the British and Irish Lions. McBride continued to play for Ireland throughout the 1960s and played for Ireland when they first defeated South Africa (the Springboks) in 1965, and when Ireland defeated Australia in Sydney ‚Äî the first time a Home Nations team had defeated a major southern hemisphere team in their own country. He was again selected for the Lions in 1966, this time touring New Zealand and Australia. He toured South Africa with the Lions again in 1968. He was selected to play for the Lions in their 1971 tour of New Zealand. Despite being criticized by some as being \\"over the hill\\", McBride was made pack leader and helped the Lions to a Test series win over New Zealand; their first and last series win over New Zealand. He received an MBE in 1971 for services to rugby football. 1974 Lions tour to South Africa McBride's outstanding leadership qualities led to his appointment as captain of the British and Irish Lions in their 1974 tour to South Africa. The Test series was won 3‚Äì0, with one match drawn ‚Äî the first Lions series ever won in South Africa. It was one of the most controversial and physical Test match series ever played. The management of the Lions concluded that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, and so decided to match fire with fire.Great Lions rugby moments: Willie John McBride's '99' call Telegraph.

Retrieved 20 October 2011 At that time there were only substitutions if a doctor agreed that a player was physically unable to continue and there were no video cameras and sideline officials to keep the punching, kicking, and head butting to a minimum. If the South Africans were to resort to foul play then the Lions decided \\"to get their retaliation in first.\\" The signal for this was to call \\"99\\" (a shortened version of the emergency number in Ireland and in the United Kingdom ‚Äî 999). This was a signal for the Lions to clobber their nearest rival players. Retirement In 1975 as his international career was ending he played his last game for Ireland at Lansdowne Road. The game was against France, and near the end of the match he scored his first test try for Ireland. It was the crowning moment of a great playing career. His last international game was against Wales on Saturday 15 March 1975.Willie-John McBride ESPN Scrum. After retiring from playing the game, McBride coached the Irish team and was manager of the 1983 Lions tour to New Zealand. Despite the test results being mainly poor, team camaraderie was high and some good wins were recorded in other games. In 1997 he was an inaugural inductee into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. He lives in Ballyclare. He has been asked to present Test jerseys and give motivational speeches to Lions players prior to matches.

Through his mother‚Äôs second marriage to Ptolemy I he became a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. He managed to wrest independence for Cyrenaica (in modern Libya) from the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt, and became King of Cyrenaica from 276 BC to 250 BC. Family background and early life Magas was the first-born son of the noblewoman Berenice I and her first husband Philip, who had served as a military officer in the campaigns of Alexander the Great.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I He had two younger sisters: Antigone of Epirus and Theoxena of Syracuse.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I His father, Philip was the son of Amyntas by an unnamed mother.Ancient Library article: Philippus no. 5 Plutarch (Pyrrhus 4.4) implies that his father was previously married and had children, including daughters born to him.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I, Footnote 6 Phillip served as a military officer in the service of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great and was known for commanding one division of the phalanx in Alexander‚Äôs wars.Ancient Library article: Magas no.1 Berenice I, mother of Magas, represented on a coin with her second husband, the powerful Ptolemy I Soter.

About 318 BCE, his father died of natural causes. After the death of Magas‚Äô father, Magas‚Äô mother took him and his siblings to the Ptolemaic Kingdom, where they were a part of the entourage of his mother‚Äôs second maternal cousin Eurydice. Eurydice was then the wife of Ptolemy I Soter, the first Greek pharaoh and founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty. By 317 BCE, Ptolemy I fell in love with Berenice and repudiated Eurydice to marry her. His mother, through her marriage to Ptolemy, thus became an Egyptian Queen and the Queen mother of the Ptolemaic dynasty.Berenice I article at Livius.org Through his mother's marriage to Ptolemy, Magas was a stepson to Ptolemy; he became an Egyptian Prince living in his stepfather's court and was a member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. His mother bore Ptolemy three children: two daughters, Arsinoe II, Philotera and the future Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Berenice I Governorship and kingship of Cyrenaica Magas as Ptolemaic governor, first reign, circa 300 - 282/75 BC. Rev: silphium and small crab symbols. Around five years after the death of the Cyrenese ruler Ophellas, Magas, then about 20 years old, received the governorship of Cyrenaica from the ruling Ptolemies in Egypt: his mother Queen Berenice I and his stepfather Ptolemy I. As a posthumous honor to his biological father, Magas, when he served as a priest of the Greek God Apollo, had dedicated an honorific inscription proudly naming him as ‚Äòthe eponymous priest‚Äô and ‚ÄòMagas son of Philip‚Äô.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Magas of Cyrene, Footnote 2 Following the death of his stepfather Ptolemy I in 283 BC, Magas tried on several occasions to wrest independence for Cyrenaica from his stepfather's successor, his maternal half-brother Ptolemy Philadelphus, until he crowned himself King around 276 BC. It was the first time Cyrene had a king since Arcesilaus IV around 440 BC. Berenice II was the daughter of Magas of Cyrene. Magas then married Apama II, his third maternal cousin and one of the daughters of Seleucid King Antiochus I Soter and Stratonice of Syria. Antiochus I used his marital alliance to foment a pact to invade Egypt. Apama II and Magas had a daughter called Berenice II, who was their only child. Magas opened hostilities against Ptolemy II in 274 BC, attacking Egypt from the west, as Antiochus I was attacking Palestine. However, Magas had to cancel his operations due to an internal revolt of the Libyan nomad Marmaridae. In the east, Antiochus I suffered defeat against the armies of Ptolemy II. Magas at least managed to maintain the independence of Cyrenaica until his death in 250 BC. Magas betrothed his daughter Berenice II to Ptolemy III Euergetes, the son of Ptolemy II, as a way to seal an alliance between the two realms and secure the independence of Cyrene.Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L. Clayman, Oxford University Press, 2014, p.32 sq. After the death of Magas, Apama II broke the marital alliance between her daughter Berenice II and Ptolemy III and proposed her daughter and the throne to Demetrius the Fair, son of the Antigonid king Demetrius I Poliorcetes, who became the new king of Cyrene.Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L. Clayman, Oxford University Press, 2014, p.36 sq. This gave the Antigonids strategic control of the western side of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. After Demetrius was assassinated by Berenice for cheating with her mother Apama, Berenice returned to Egypt to finally marry her original fianc√©, Ptolemy III Euergetes. Magas is known to have favored the arts and sciences in Cyrene, and was close to the philosophical school of the Cyrenaics. The philosophy of the Cyrenaics under Magas evolved in a way that has similarities with Skepticism, Epicurianism and also Buddhism.Berenice II and the Golden Age of Ptolemaic Egypt, Dee L.

Magas was known by name to the contemporary Indian Emperor Ashoka, and he may have received Buddhist emissaries from India: indeed Magas is mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka, as one of the recipients of Ashoka's Buddhist proselytism.\\"The conquest by Dharma has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred yojanas (5,400-9,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni (Sri Lanka).\\" (Edicts of Ashoka, 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika). Ashoka also claims that he encouraged the development of herbalism, for men and animals, in the territories of the Hellenistic Kings.\\"Everywhere within Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi's [Ashoka] domain, and among the people beyond the borders, the Cholas, the Pandyas, the Satiyaputras, the Keralaputras, as far as Tamraparni and where the Greek king Antiochos rules, and among the kings who are neighbors of Antiochos, everywhere has Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, made provision for two types of medical treatment: medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals. Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available, I have had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animals.\\" Edicts of Ashoka, 2nd Rock Edict Buddhist proselytism at the time of king Ashoka (260‚Äì218 BCE), according to the Edicts of Ashoka. There are no records of such emissaries in Western sources. However, the philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene, from the city of Cyrene where Magas ruled in Cyrenaica, is sometimes thought to have been influenced by the teachings of Ashoka's Buddhist missionaries, given the similarity of some of his teachings with Buddhism.\\"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed Peisithanatos, \\"The advocate of death\\") was contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited to teach.\\"Jean-Marie Lafont, INALCO in \\"Les Dossiers d'Arch√©ologie\\", No254, p.78Historical Dictionary of Ancient Greek Philosophy, Anthony Preus, Rowman & Littlefield, 2015, p.184 Still, Magas probably was quite knowledgeable about India. His father, Philip, had been a phalanx officer in the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Later, Magas, having been raised in part at the Ptolemaic court, must also have received first-hand accounts of India from his stepfather Ptolemy I, a former general in Alexander's campaigns. The predecessor of Magas in Cyrene, the Ptolemaic governor named Ophellas, had also been one of the Alexander's officers in India, in charge of one of his triremes during the expedition down the Indus River. Magas was probably quite acquainted with matters pertaining to India through his contacts with such veterans of the Indian campaigns. See also *List of kings of Cyrene References Sources * W.

She funded most of the research necessary to develop the first birth control pill. Early life and education Katharine Dexter was born on August 27, 1875, in Dexter, Michigan, in her grandparents' mansion, Gordon Hall, and grew up in Chicago where her father, Wirt Dexter, was a prominent lawyer. Following the early death of her father of a heart attack at age 57 when she was 14 years old, she and her mother Josephine moved to Boston in 1890. Four years later, her brother Samuel died of meningitis at age 25. Katharine graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1904, earning a BSc in biology. Marriage to Stanley McCormick She planned to attend medical school, but instead married Stanley Robert McCormick, the youngest son of Cyrus McCormick and heir to the International Harvester fortune, on September 15, 1904. In September 1905, they moved into a house in Brookline, Massachusetts. The couple did not have any children. Stanley graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1895 where he had also been a gifted athlete on the varsity tennis team. He had been showing signs of progressively worsening mental illness. In September 1906, he was hospitalized for over a year at McLean Hospital and was originally diagnosed with dementia praecox, an early label for what is now today known as schizophrenia. In June 1908, Stanley was moved to the McCormicks' Riven Rock estate in Montecito, California, where his schizophrenic older sister, Mary Virginia, had lived from 1898 to 1904 before being placed in a Huntsville, Alabama, sanitarium. While there, he was examined by the prominent German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin and diagnosed with the catatonic form of dementia praecox. In 1909, Stanley was declared legally incompetent and his guardianship divided between Katharine and the McCormick family. Women's rights activist Katharine's plea for gender equality was apparent from early on. As an undergraduate at MIT, she confronted administration officials. MIT required that women wear hats (fashionably spruced up with feathers). Katharine refused. She argued that it was a fire hazard for feathered hats to be worn in laboratories. As a result, MIT's administration changed their policies. In 1909 McCormick spoke at the first outdoor rally for woman suffrage in Massachusetts. She became vice president and treasurer of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and funded the association's publication the Woman's Journal. McCormick organized much of Carrie Chapman Catt's efforts to gain ratification for the Nineteenth Amendment. While working with Catt, she met other social activists, including Mary Dennett and Margaret Sanger. Katharine met Sanger in 1917, and later that year joined the Committee of 100, a group of women who practiced promoting the legalization of birth control. During World War I, Katharine also worked as a chairwoman of the association's War Service Department. In addition, she was a member of the Women's Committee of the Council of National Defense. In 1920, after the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, McCormick became the vice president of the League of Women Voters. Throughout the 1920s McCormick worked with Sanger on birth control issues. McCormick smuggled more than 1,000 diaphragms from Europe to New York City to Sanger's Clinical Research Bureau. She scheduled meetings with major European diaphragm manufacturers in cities such as Rome and Paris, and used her language skills and biology background to pose as a French or German scientist and place large orders for the devices. They were shipped to her family chateau outside Geneva, where they were sewn into the linings of fashionable coats and other garments. She smuggled them past U.S. customs agents in New York, having successfully disguised them as the spoils of extravagant European shopping sprees for high-end fashions. She made these trips every summer from 1922 to 1925, only retiring after the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake forced her to redirect her attention to rebuilding her husband's estate and devote her energy to helping direct his care. In 1927, McCormick hosted a reception of delegates attending the 1927 World Population Conference at her home in Geneva. In that year McCormick also turned to the science of endocrinology to aid her husband, believing that a defective adrenal gland caused his schizophrenia. Philanthropist Inspired by her husband's diagnosis, Katharine was determined to find a cure. Believing that Stanley's illness was a defective adrenal gland, and could be treated with hormone treatment., she established the Neuroendocrine Research Foundation from 1927 to 1947 at Harvard Medical School, and subsidized the publication of the journal Endocrinology. Originally called the \\"Stanley R. McCormick Memorial Foundation for Neuro- Endocrine Research Corporation\\", it was the first U.S institute to launch research on the link between endocrinology and mental illness. In addition, Katharine also created a research center for the care of the mentally ill at Worcester State Hospital. Katharine's mother Josephine died on November 16, 1937, at age 91 leaving Katharine an estate of more than 10 million dollars. Stanley died on January 19, 1947, at age 72 leaving an estate of over 35 million dollars to Katharine. She spent five years settling his estate, 85% of which went to pay inheritance taxes. In 1953 McCormick met Gregory Goodwin Pincus through Margaret Sanger. Pincus had been working on developing a hormonal birth control method since 1951 and his own research laboratory, the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology. The drug company that supported Pincus stopped funding his pioneering research because he had yet to make a profit. As a result, McCormick started to fund Pincus's research foundation. The donations started at $100,000 annually, and later $150,000-$180,000 up until her death in 1967. In sum, McCormick had provided $2 million (around $20 million today) of her own money for the development of the oral contraceptive pill. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the sale of the Pill in 1957 for menstrual disorders and added contraception to its indications in 1960. Even after the pill was approved, she continued to fund Pincus's lab and research on ways into improving birth control research through the 1960s. After the successful development and approval of the contraceptive pill, Katharine yielded her attention to the lack of housing for women at MIT. MIT was always coeducational, however, it could provide housing to only some fifty female students. Therefore, many of the women who attended MIT had to be local residents. However, the place of women at the Institute was far from secure as Katharine Dexter told Dorothy Weeks (a physicist and mathematician who earned her master's and doctorate from MIT) that she had lived \\"in a cold fear that suddenly‚Äîunexpectedly‚ÄîTech might exclude women...\\". In order to provide female students a permanent place at MIT, she would donate the money to found Stanley McCormick Hall, an all female dormitory that would allow MIT to house 200 female students. Katharine's funding made a tremendous impact of the number of women at MIT, increasing from 3% to 40%. The ramifications of the hall are best stated by William Hecht '61, executive vice president of the Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT when he said, \\"the visible presence of women at MIT helped open up the science and engineering professions to a large part of the population that before had been excluded. It demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that at MIT men and women are equal.\\" McCormick was also an avid supporter of the arts, particularly to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art where she was one of the Museum's founding members, vice president and donor of the Stanley McCormick Gallery in 1942. Sharing vice president duties with fellow philanthropist and art collector Wright S. Ludington, McCormick served on the Museum's Buildings Committee and was responsible for the hiring of the renowned Chicago architect, David Adler, to convert the old post office into the art museum. Death She died on December 28, 1967, in Boston, Massachusetts, aged 92. Her will provided $5 million to the Stanford University School of Medicine to support female physicians, $5 million to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which funded the Katharine Dexter McCormick Library in Manhattan, New York City, and $1 million to the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology. In addition, McCormick made arrangements for $500,000 to be donated to the Chicago Art Institute and the donation of nine important impressionist paintings to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, which included three major landscapes by Claude Monet. Along with these paintings, McCormick also donated her residence, which is now known as the Ridley-Tree Education Center. It is currently used by the Museum for child and adult art classes. Legacy Katharine McCormick is a character in T.C. Boyle's novel Riven Rock (1998), which is mainly about her husband Stanley's mental illness. McCormick was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1998. She was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2000.

In Chichester Cathedral a shrine dedicated to Richard had become a richly decorated centre of pilgrimage. In 1538, during the reign of Henry VIII, the shrine was plundered and destroyed by order of Thomas Cromwell. Richard of Chichester is the patron saint of Sussex in southern England; since 2007, his translated saint's day of 16 June has been celebrated as Sussex Day. Life Richard was born in Burford, near the town of Wyche (modern Droitwich, Worcestershire) and was an orphan member of a gentry family.Greenway. Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: volume 5: pp. 1-6.Capes, 1913, p. 13) On the death of their parents Richard's elder brother was heir to the estates but he was not old enough to inherit, so the lands were subject to a feudal wardship. On coming of age his brother took possession of his lands, but was required to pay a medieval form of death duty that left the family so impoverished, that Richard had to work for him on the farm.Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. p. 242 His brother also made Richard heir to the estate. According to Richard's biographers, friends tried to arrange a match with a certain noble lady. However Richard rejected the proposed match, suggesting that his brother might marry her instead; he also reconveyed the estates back to his brother, preferring a life of study and the church.Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. pp. 242-243 Educated at the University of Oxford, Richard soon began to teach in the university. From there he proceeded to Paris and then Bologna, where he distinguished himself by his proficiency in canon law. On returning to England in 1235, Richard was elected Oxford's chancellor.Stephens. Memorials. pp. 84 - 85. His former tutor, Edmund of Abingdon, had become archbishop of Canterbury.Farmer. Richard of Chichester in Oxford Dictionary of Saints. Available Online Retrieved 12 March 2011. Richard shared Edmund's ideals of clerical reform and supported papal rights even against the king. In 1237, Archbishop Edmund appointed Richard chancellor of the diocese of Canterbury. Richard joined the archbishop during his exile at Pontigny, and was with him when the archbishop died circa 1240.Foster. Richard of Chichester (1197 - 1253). p.12 Richard then decided to become a priest and studied theology for two years with the Dominicans at Orl√©ans. Upon returning to England, Richard became the parish priest at Charing and at Deal, but soon was reappointed chancellor of Canterbury by the new archbishop Boniface of Savoy. In 1244 Richard was elected Bishop of Chichester. Henry III and part of the chapter refused to accept him, the king favouring the candidature of Robert Passelewe (d. 1252). Archbishop Boniface refused to confirm Passelew, so both sides appealed to the pope. The king confiscated the see's properties and revenues, but Innocent IV confirmed Richard's election and consecrated him bishop at Lyons in March 1245.Fryde Handbook of British Chronology p. 239 Richard then returned to Chichester, but the king refused to restore the see's properties for two years, and then did so only after being threatened with excommunication. Henry III forbade anyone to house or feed Richard. At first, Richard lived at Tarring in the house of his friend Simon, the parish priest of Tarring, visited his entire diocese on foot, and cultivated figs in his spare time. Richard's private life was supposed to have displayed rigid frugality and temperance. Richard was an ascetic who wore a hair-shirt and refused to eat off silver. He kept his diet simple and rigorously excluded animal flesh; having been a vegetarian since his days at Oxford. Richard was merciless to usurers, corrupt clergy and priests who mumbled the Mass. He was also a stickler for clerical privilege. Richard's episcopate was marked by the favour which he showed to the Dominicans, a house of this order at Orl√©ans having sheltered him during his stay in France, and by his earnestness in preaching a crusade. After dedicating St Edmund's Chapel at Dover, he died aged 56 at the Maison Dieu, Dover at midnight on 3 April 1253, where the Pope had ordered him to preach a crusade. His internal organs were removed and placed in that chapel's altar. Richard's body was then carried to Chichester and buried, according to his wishes, in the chapel on the north side of the nave, dedicated to his patron St. Edmund.Atkinson. Chichester Cathedral: The Shrine of St Richard (Retroquire). pp.16-18 His remains were translated to a new shrine in 1276. Episcopal statutes Sculpture of Richard of Chichester outside St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean After the full rights of the see and its revenues were returned to him in 1246, the new bishop showed much eagerness to reform the manners and morals of his clergy, and also to introduce greater order and reverence into the services of the Church.Stephens. Memorials of The See at Chichester pp.87-93 Richard overruled Henry on several occasions. Richard defrocked a priest who had seduced a nun out of her convent, turning aside a petition from the king in the priest's favour.Lower. The Worthies of Sussex. p. 244 Richard was militant in protecting the clergy from abuse. The townsmen of Lewes violated the right of sanctuary by seizing a criminal in church and lynching him, and Richard made them exhume the body and give it a proper burial in consecrated ground. He also imposed severe penance on knights who attacked priests. Richard produced a body of statutes with the aid of his chapter, for the organisation of the church in his diocese and the expected conduct of its clergy. It seems that many of the clergy still secretly married, though such alliances were not recognised by canon law, and as such their women's status was that of a mistress or concubine. The Bishop endeavoured to suppress the practice in his diocese with relentless austerity. By Richard's statutes: > It was decreed that married clergy should be deprived of their benefices; > their concubines were to be denied the privileges of the church during their > lives and also after death; they were pronounced incapable of inheriting any > property from their husbands, and any such bequests would be donated for the > upkeep of the cathedral.

Shrine It was generally believed that miracles were wrought at Richard's tomb in Chichester cathedral, which was long a popular place of pilgrimage, and in 1262, just 9 years after his death, he was canonized at Viterbo by Pope Urban IV.* Richard's feast day is on 3 April in the West, but because this date generally falls within Lent or Eastertide this is normally translated to 16 June in some provinces of the Anglican Communion (the Anglican Church of Canada, for example, commemorates Richard on 3 April), which venerates St. Richard more widely than does the Roman Catholic Church. Richard furnished the chronicler, Matthew Paris, with material for the life of St. Edmund Rich, and instituted the offerings for the cathedral at Chichester which were known later as \\"St. Richard's pence\\". During the episcopate of the first Anglican bishop of Chichester, Richard Sampson, King Henry VIII of England, through his Vicar-General, Thomas Cromwell ordered the destruction of Richard's shrine in Chichester cathedral in 1538.Tatton-Brown.Chichester Cathedral: Destruction, Repair and Restoration in Mary Hobbs. Chichester Cathedral: An Historic Survey. p.143. The shrine was demolished on Friday 20 November and all the silver, gold and jewels were ordered by Henty VIII to be taken to the Tower of London. > Forasmuch as we have lately been informed that in our cathedral church of > Chichester there hath been used long heretofore, and yet at this day is > used, much superstition and a certain kind of idolatry about the shrine and > bones of a certain bishop of the same, whom they call Saint Richard, and a > certain resort there of common people, which being men of simplicity are > seduced by the instigation of some of the clergy, who take advantage of > their credulity to ascribe miracles of healing and other virtues to the said > bones, that God only hath authority to grant. . . . .

The Shrine of St. Richard had, up to this point, enjoyed a level of popularity approaching that accorded to Thomas Becket at Canterbury. It seems that someone associated with the parish of West Wittering in Sussex, possibly William Ernley, using his position as royal commissioner for the destruction of St. Richard's Shrine, may have spirited away the relics and bones of St. Richard and hidden them in their own parish church, as there are persistent legends of the presence there, of the remains of the saint: > The Lady Chapel not only contains the Saxon Cross but also an ancient broken > marble slab engraved with a Bishop's pastoral staff and a Greek cross > believed to have come from a reliquary containing the relics of St. Richard > of Chichester, a 13th century bishop who often visited West Wittering.

The modern St Richard's Shrine is located in the retro-quire of Chichester cathedral and was re-established in 1930 by Dean Duncan Jones.Foster. Richard of Chichester. p. 65 In 1987 during the restoration of the Abbey of La Lucerne, in Normandy, the lower part of a man's arm was discovered in a reliquary, the relic was thought to be Richard's.Mary Foster. The relic in Paul Fosters. Richard of Chichester. pp. 70-73 After examination, to establish its provenance, the relic was offered to Bishop Eric Kemp and received into the cathedral on 15 June 1990. The relic was buried in 1991 below the St Richard altar. A further relic, together with an authentication certificate, was offered from Rome at the same time and is now housed at the bishop's chapel in Chichester. The modern shrine of Richard contains an altar that was designed by Robert Potter, a tapestry designed by Ursula Benker-Schirmer (partly woven in her studio in Bavaria and partly at the West Dean College) and an icon designed by Sergei Fyodorov that shows St Richard in episcopal vestments, his hand raised in blessing towards the viewer, but also in supplication to the figure of Christ who appears to him from heaven . Prayer Richard is widely remembered today for the popular prayer ascribed to him: > Thanks be to Thee, my Lord Jesus Christ > For all the benefits Thou hast given me, > For all the pains and insults Thou hast borne for me. > O most merciful Redeemer, friend and brother, > May I know Thee more clearly, > Love Thee more dearly, > Follow Thee more nearly.Bullock-Webster. p.31 Acts and Devotion. Prayer 48. > Retrieved 18 June 2013 Richard is supposed to have recited the prayer on his deathbed, surrounded by the clergy of the diocese.Mike Stone. The St Richard Prayer in Fosters. Richard of Chichester (1197 - 1253) pp.78-83 The words were transcribed, in Latin, by his confessor Ralph Bocking, a Dominican friar, and were eventually published in the Acta Sanctorum, an encyclopedic text in 68 folio volumes of documents examining the lives of Christian saints. The British Library copy, contains what is believed to be Bockings transcription of the prayer: > Gratias tibi ago, Domine Jesu Christe, de omnibus beneficiis quae mihi > praestitisti; > pro poenis et opprobriis, quae pro me pertulisti; > propter quae planctus ille lamentabilis vere tibi competebat. > Non est dolor similis sicut dolor meus.Acta Sanctorum.

Whoever translated the Latin into English was obviously skilled in his craft as he managed to produce a rhyming triplet, namely \\"clearly, dearly, nearly\\". However, versions of St Richards prayer, before the 20th century, did not contain the triplet and it is thought that the first version that did was published in \\"The Churchmans Prayer Manual\\" by G.R.Bullock-Webster in 1913. The first use of the rhyming triplet in a hymn was in the \\"Mirfield Mission Hymnbook\\" of 1922, and the first use of the phrase \\"Day by Day\\" was in the \\"Songs of Praise, Enlarged Edition\\" published in 1931.Vaughan Williams.Songs of Praise, Enlarged Edition. Hymn 399. Tune: Stonethwaite by Arthur Somervell The author who is credited with translating the prayer from the original Acta Sanctorum and bringing it to public notice, was Cecil Headlam in 1898.Headlam. Prayers of Saints. pp.v - viii The following version in the \\"Prayers of Saints\\" is quite different from the one that is familiar today : > THE DYING PRAYER OF S. RICHARD, > Bishop of Chichester. > LORD JESU CHRIST, I thank Thee for > all the blessings Thou hast given me, > and for all the sufferings and shame Thou > didst endure for me, on which account that > pitiable cry of sorrow was Thine : \\" Behold and > see, if there was any sorrow like unto My > sorrow ! \\" Thou knowest, Lord, how willing > I should be to bear insult, and pain, and death > for Thee ; therefore have mercy on me, for to > Thee do I commend my spirit. AmenHeadlam. Prayers of Saints. pp.33 - 34 > The prayer was adapted for the song \\"Day by Day\\" in the musical Godspell (1971), with music by Stephen Schwartz.Schwartz. Godspell:Vocal Selections. p.8. The words used, with a few embellishments, were based on the following from \\"Songs of Praise, Enlarged Edition\\": > Day by day, > Dear Lord, of thee three things I pray: > To see thee more clearly, > Love thee more dearly, > Follow thee more nearly, > Day by Day. > A portion of the prayer has been incorporated into the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church for use by the personal ordinariates established to bring the Anglican patrimony into the Church. Observance of the memorial of Saint Richard of Chichester on 16 June is inscribed in the calendar of Divine Worship: The Missal and the following Collect is provided: > MOST merciful Redeemer, > who gavest to thy Bishop Richard a love of learning, > a zeal for souls, and a devotion to the poor: > grant that, encouraged by his example, > and aided by his prayers, > we may know thee more clearly, > love thee more dearly, > and follow thee more nearly, > day by day; > who livest and reignest with the Father > in the unity of the Holy Spirit, ever one God, > world without end.

Since 2007, his translated saint's day, 16 June, has been celebrated as Sussex Day. Richard is honoured with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 3 April, which is also the date for his commemoration in the new Roman Martyrology of 2004 for the Roman Catholic Church.

The medium to large tree has a sparse, semi-deciduous canopy of grey-green leaves. The twigs and leaves are hairless as the name imberbe suggests. Its heartwood is dark brown, close- grained, and very hard and heavy, as suggested by its vernacular name. The durable heartwood is much sought after in the woodcarving industry. The Hereros and Ovambos of Namibia attach special cultural and religious significance to the tree, as to them it is the great ancestor of all animals and people, which must be passed with respect. Range It is native to the mesic savannas of Africa south of the equator, from KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, in the south to Tanzania in the north. It is a native tree in South Africa, eSwatini, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, Zambia and Tanzania. It is a protected tree in South Africa. Description The largest bushwillow species of southern Africa has a distinct habit and features. It has a spreading, rather sparse, roundish to slightly umbrella- shaped crown. The smallish, grey-green leaves and small, yellowish-green samaras are carried on spiny, attenuate branchlets. It typically grows to tall, but may reach . In maturity the single, solid bole may be up in diameter. The distinctive bark is pale to dark grey in colour, deeply fissured lengthwise. Irregular horizontal cracks infuse the bark a fairly regular, coarse-grained appearance. Uses *The wood is dense and very hard, difficult to plane, but drills, sands and turns well. It is termite resistant. It was once used for railway sleepers and is now prized as wood for ornamental work and furniture. *It burns very slowly with intense heat, and is often used for a fire which is intended to burn all night in order to keep wild animals at bay. It is sometimes used in a barbecue to provide a hot, long-lasting flame. *The ashes are used as whitewash for painting walls of kraal huts. *The ashes can also be used as toothpaste when mixed into a paste with water.

His work was considered to be visionary and inspired by the rugged Cornish landscape. He was the son of a clay-kiln worker and his mother, Eveline Clemo (n√©e Polmounter, died 1977), was a dogmatic nonconformist. Early life Clemo was born in the parish of St Stephen-in- Brannel near St Austell. His father was killed at sea towards the end of the First World War and he was raised by his mother, who exerted a dominant influence on him. He was educated at the village school but after age of 13 his formal schooling ceased with the onset on his blindness. He became deaf around age 20, and blind in 1955, about 19 years later. The china clay mines and works around which he grew up were to feature strongly in his work. Literary career Clemo's early work was published in the local press but his literary breakthrough came with the novel Wilding Graft, which was published by Chatto and Windus in 1948 winning an Atlantic Award. This was followed in 1949 by his autobiography, Confessions of a Rebel, which established Clemo as a remarkable and original writer. Clemo developed further as a writer and in 1951 he published his first collection, The Clay Verge. Set in a stark landscape, the poems explore the forces of nature and the workings of a hard-won grace. He received national recognition for the first time in the same year during the Festival of Britain where he was awarded a literary prize. In 1970 he was appointed a Bard of the Gorseth Kernow and conferred with the title Poet of the Clay. In 1981, at the age of 65, he received an honorary literary doctorate from the University of Exeter. Marriage Trethosa Chapel Clemo was deeply religious and believed it was God's will for him to marry. However it was not until he reached his early 50s when he met and subsequently married Ruth Peaty in 1968, who came from Weymouth. Following his marriage in 1968 he was able to discover a lighter side to life and poetry. His love for Ruth, both expressed through his poetry and his mischievous wit, are encapsulated in the little romantic cards he composed each year for her. Public recognition By the age of 65 he had achieved sufficient recognition for a dramatised version of his biography, directed by Norman Stone, to be produced and screened by the BBC in 1980. A few years later, a book about the role of providence in the marriage of Jack Clemo was written by Sally Magnusson. He was also photographed by Tricia Porter in 1975, and the images are held at the National Portrait Gallery in London. The first major academic conference on Clemo, \\"Kindling the Scarp\\",\\"Kindling the Scarp\\" was held at Wheal Martyn, Cornwall, on 31 May and 1 June 2013, organised by scholars at the University of Warwick and the University of Exeter. This coincided with the closure of Trethosa Chapel on Sunday 2 June and the relocation of their Clemo Memorial Room artefacts to Wheal Martyn Museum and Park in St Austell. Italian sojourn An unexpected change to his writing subsequently occurred after two trips to Italy late in his life. In 1987 he first visited Venice and then, six years later, he also travelled to Florence. This seemed to prompt a blaze of much more colourful verse, integrating the personal drama of his own life with the sweep of Italian faith, culture, landscape and history. In \\"Heretic in Florence\\" he recounted the stench of the dry river Arno and its cure, portraying it as a metaphor for his own release from merely barren art. Death and legacy Clemo died, aged 78, in Weymouth on 25 July 1994. His personal and literary papers, including diaries, correspondence, and manuscripts of prose and poetry works, are held by the University of Exeter. An annual Jack Clemo Poetry Competition was established in 1995 by the Arts Centre Group (ACG) having received a legacy from Jack Clemo's estate. The first winner was Ulster English teacher and poet Ray GivansACG Magazine Rhubarb Rhubarb p. 5 Dec 1995 and the prize was ¬£30 and a sculpture by ACG member Iain Cotton in Cornish stone with a Celtic design (the sculpture to be held for one year). The winning poem was entitled Work Ethic. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in Jack Clemo, led by writer and editor Luke Thompson. This has led to the publication of a new Selected Poems (Enitharmon, 2015), a complete collection of dialect tales A Proper Mizz-Maze (Francis Boutle, 2016), a pamphlet short story The Clay Dump (Guillemot Press, 2016), an album of Clemo's poetry, Clay Hymnal, set to music by folk musician Jim Causley, and the first full biography of Jack Clemo, written by Luke Thompson and entitled Clay Phoenix (Ally Press, 2016). Posthumous controversy The former Cornish home of Jack Clemo was demolished by the Goonvean China Clay Company on 6 September 2005 to make way for new laboratories. This provoked much anger both locally and from fans of the poet, who had lived most of his life at the cottage, except for his last 10 years after having moved to Weymouth in 1984. Dr Philip Payton, director of the Institute of Cornish Studies in Truro, said he would like to see the cottage as a museum. \\"You cannot think about Jack Clemo without thinking about the china clay country. And you cannot think about the china clay country in any serious sense without pondering about Jack Clemo. To obliterate the cottage would be to erase [Clemo] from the landscape of Cornwall. He is hugely important in a Cornish context and also as an international poet. He is one of the greats. There is something about Jack Clemo's cottage that says so much about him as a person. It is so humble and in such a bleak place and it speaks volumes about his disabilities and achievements.\\" Alan Sanders, secretary of the Jack Clemo Memorial Room at Trethosa Chapel, said: \\"On a personal and literary level this cottage was highly important. I have known this cottage all my life so I am deeply saddened.

Balliol College, in Oxford, is named after him. Life John de Balliol was born before 1208 to Cecily de Fontaines, daughter of Al√©aume de Fontaines, chevalier, seigneur of Fontaines and Longpr√©-les-Corps- Saints and Hugh de Balliol, Lord of Balliol and of Barnard Castle and Gainford (c. 1177 ‚Äì 2 February 1229). It is believed that he was educated at Durham School in the city of Durham. In 1223, Lord John married Dervorguilla of Galloway, the daughter of Alan, Lord of Galloway and Margaret of Huntingdon. By the mid-thirteenth century, his wife had become very wealthy, principally as a result of inheritances from her family. This wealth allowed Balliol to play a prominent public role, and, on Henry III's instruction, he served as joint protector of the young king of Scots, Alexander III. He was one of Henry III's leading counsellors between 1258 and 1265. and was appointed Sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire from 1261 to 1262. He was captured at the Battle of Lewes in 1264, but escaped and rejoined King Henry. http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT4/JUST1/JUST1no618/aJUST1no618fronts/IMG_1246.htm ; third entry, mentioning Simon de Montford & the Battle of Lewes, in line 4 In 1265 Thomas de Musgrave owed him a debt of 123 marks.

It is the main city of the mesoregion and microregion of Bauru. The population is 376,818 (2019 est.) in an area of 667.68 km¬≤.Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica Established in 1896, its boundaries are Regin√≥polis to the north, Arealva to the northeast, Pederneiras to the east, Agudos and Piratininga to the south and Ava√≠ to the west. The presence of a strong service sector, many college campuses - including the University of S√£o Paulo and Universidade Estadual Paulista - and the city's location at the junction of three railroads and three highways make Bauru a major urban center of the State of S√£o Paulo. It is the hometown of Marcos C√©sar Pontes, the first Brazilian in space. It is also the town where Pel√© grew up and learned his football skills. The city is served by two airports: the older Comte. Jo√£o Ribeiro de Barros Airport and the newer Bauru- Arealva Airport, officially known as Moussa Nakhl Tobias Airport, located in the adjoining municipality of Arealva. Origin of the name There are various theories intended to explain the origin of the name Bauru. One was proposed by Ismael Marinho Falc√£o, an engineer who lived for many years with the Kaingang tribe, which used to inhabit the region. According to him, the region was called ubaur√∫ because of the abundance of a herbaceous plant called ub√°, used for hampers and wicker baskets, and ur√∫, a ground bird related to the chicken. Others think that the name comes from mbai-yuru, meaning 'waterfall' or 'river in strong declivity'; or yb√° or uru, 'basket of fruits' in Old Tupi;University of S√£o Paulo , Old Tupi Vocabulary (in Portuguese) or even bauruz, as the natives who inhabited the edges of the Batalha River were called.Busch, Marcela UNESP Exposi√ß√£o \\"Bauruz\\" apresenta estilo de vida ind√≠gena, Retrieved 14 December 2011 History Historically, the region occupied by Bauru was a disputed territory between two Indigenous groups: the Kaingang and the Guaran√≠. In the eighteenth century, ethnic Brazilian pioneers attempted to settle in S√£o Paulo region, which was a crossing point of the mon√ß√µes (river expeditions) that went through Mato Grosso and Goi√°s, but they were prevented by local natives' attacks. The non-Indians only managed to settle in the region in the nineteenth century with the coming of the population coming from S√£o Paulo's coast as well the states of Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. After 1850, in search of new land for occupation and colonization, pioneers from S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais began to explore the vast region between the Serra de Botucatu, Tiet√™ River, Paranapanema River and Paran√° River, until then inhabited by Kaingang indigenous groups. In 1856, Felicissimo Antonio Pereira, coming from Minas Gerais, purchased land and settled, near the current center of Bauru, the Fazenda das Flores (Farm of Flowers). Years later, in 1884, this farm (also called Campos Novos de Bauru) have spun off part of its area for the training camp of the S√£o Sebasti√£o de Bauru. The district has progressed, even being subject to attacks of native Kaingang and relatively isolated from the rest of the state and became district of Agudos on 1888. The arrival of migrants from eastern S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais led to the emancipation of the city on August 1, 1896. The new municipality at first lived from the cultivation of coffee, despite having weaker and infertile lands than the rest of the state. In 1905, Bauru was chosen as the starting point of the Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, which linked by rail, Bauru to Corumb√°, Mato Grosso do Sul, near the border with Bolivia. During the first half of the twentieth century, Bauru becomes the main economic hub of the region comprised by west S√£o Paulo, northern Paran√° and Mato Grosso do Sul.

The new stadium, opened on 5 April 2009, has been named Gamla Ullevi as well.  Name  Gamla Ullevi was named after the Nordic god Ull. He was a skier and archer who chased away the winter so he could wake up the goddess of the earth. The word vi means holy place. When Gamla Ullevi first opened it was called Ullervi, but after being pressured by a professor of Nordic languages, Hjalmar Lindroth, the r was removed. It was only added in the first place to make the name easier to pronounce. (Johansson & Nilsson 1992, p. 4)  History  Before Ullevi, the location was called Idrottsplatsen. It was a velocipede arena with room for 600 spectators. Eventually other sports began to use the facilities and a tenniscourt was built in 1901. Other courts were added too, but a new football stadium was needed with a proper grass pitch because of the growing interest in football. G√∂teborgs idrottsf√∂rbund created a corporation that had a capital of 90 000kr to spend on a new arena. The end cost of Gamla Ullevi was 160 000kr. It was designed as a stadium for only football despite half-promises being made to the archers and equestrians about space. At that time, the finished arena could hold 12 000 spectators. (Johansson & Nilsson 1992, p. 6‚Äì7) Ullevi became more than just an arena for football though. Next to the football pitch, the ice-skating rink was built and opened 6 January 1917 with a bandy match. Ice hockey and figure skating were two sports that also used the facilities, as well as boxing, fencing, handball, and tennis. (Johansson & Nilsson 1992) In 1924, Gothenburg city became the owners of Gamla Ullevi. They closed it in 1934 for renovations where they added more seats for spectators, and reopened in 1935.

The Shroud of Turin, also called the Holy Shroud (, ' or '), is a length of linen cloth bearing the negative image of a man. Some claim the image depicts Jesus of Nazareth and the fabric is the burial shroud in which he was wrapped after crucifixion. First mentioned in 1354, the shroud was denounced in 1389 by the local bishop of Troyes as a fake. Currently the Catholic Church neither formally endorses nor rejects the shroud, and in 2013 the current Pope Francis referred to it as an ‚Äúicon of a man scourged and crucified‚Äù. The shroud has been kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Turin, in northern Italy, since 1578. In 1988 radiocarbon dating established the shroud was from the Middle Ages, between the years 1260 and 1390. Some shroud researchers have challenged this carbon dating, arguing the results were skewed by the introduction of material from the Middle Ages to the portion of the shroud used for radiocarbon dating. Diverse arguments have been made in scientific and popular publications claiming to prove that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. However, all of the hypotheses put forward to challenge the radiocarbon dating have been scientifically refuted, including the medieval repair hypothesis, the bio-contamination hypothesis and the carbon monoxide hypothesis. The image on the shroud is much clearer in black-and-white negative‚Äîfirst observed in 1898‚Äîthan in its natural sepia color. A variety of methods have been proposed for the formation of the image, but the actual method used has not yet been conclusively identified. The shroud continues to be both intensely studied and controversial. Description Secondo Pia's 1898 negative of the image on the Shroud of Turin has an appearance suggesting a positive image. It is used as part of the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. Image from Mus√©e de l'√âlys√©e, Lausanne. The shroud is rectangular, measuring approximately . The cloth is woven in a three-to-one herringbone twill composed of flax fibrils. Its most distinctive characteristic is the faint, brownish image of a front and back view of a naked man with his hands folded across his groin. The two views are aligned along the midplane of the body and point in opposite directions. The front and back views of the head nearly meet at the middle of the cloth. The image of the \\"Man of the Shroud\\" has a beard, moustache, and shoulder-length hair parted in the middle. He is muscular and tall (various experts have measured him as from ). Reddish-brown stains are found on the cloth, correlating, according to proponents, with the Biblical description of the crucifixion of Jesus. In May 1898 Italian photographer Secondo Pia was allowed to photograph the shroud. He took the first photograph of the shroud on 28 May 1898. In 1931, another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia's. In 1978, ultraviolet photographs were taken of the shroud. The shroud was damaged in a fire in 1532 in the chapel in Chambery, France. There are some burn holes and scorched areas down both sides of the linen, caused by contact with molten silver during the fire that burned through it in places while it was folded. Fourteen large triangular patches and eight smaller ones were sewn onto the cloth by Poor Clare nuns to repair the damage. History The historical records for the shroud can be separated into two time periods: before 1390 and from 1390 to the present. Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the Pray Codex. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images. The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud. The first possible historical record dates from 1353 or 1357, and the first certain record (in Lirey, France) in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a memorandum to Pope Clement VII (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed. Historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed in the small town of Lirey around the years 1353 to 1357 in the possession of a French Knight, Geoffroi de Charny, who died at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. There are no definite historical records concerning the particular shroud currently at Turin Cathedral prior to the 14th century. A burial cloth, which some historians maintain was the Shroud, was owned by the Byzantine emperors but disappeared during the Sack of Constantinople in 1204. Although there are numerous reports of Jesus' burial shroud, or an image of his head, of unknown origin, being venerated in various locations before the 14th century, there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at Turin Cathedral. The pilgrim medallion of Lirey (before 1453), drawing by Arthur Forgeais, 1865. The history of the shroud from the 15th century is well recorded. In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the House of Savoy. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by Guarino Guarini) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition. In 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of Chamb√©ry, capital of the Savoy region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. Poor Clare Nuns attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb√©ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since. Repairs were made to the shroud in 1694 by Sebastian Valfr√® to improve the repairs of the Poor Clare nuns. Further repairs were made in 1868 by Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy. The shroud remained the property of the House of Savoy until 1983, when it was given to the Holy See. A fire, possibly caused by arson, threatened the shroud on 11 April 1997. In 2002, the Holy See had the shroud restored. The cloth backing and thirty patches were removed, making it possible to photograph and scan the reverse side of the cloth, which had been hidden from view. A faint part-image of the body was found on the back of the shroud in 2004. The Shroud was placed back on public display (the 18th time in its history) in Turin from 10 April to 23 May 2010; and according to Church officials, more than 2 million visitors came to see it. On Holy Saturday (30 March) 2013, images of the shroud were streamed on various websites as well as on television for the first time in 40 years. Roberto Gottardo of the diocese of Turin stated that for the first time ever they had released high definition images of the shroud that can be used on tablet computers and can be magnified to show details not visible to the naked eye. As this rare exposition took place, Pope Francis issued a carefully worded statement which urged the faithful to contemplate the shroud with awe but, like his predecessors, he \\"stopped firmly short of asserting its authenticity\\". The shroud was again placed on display in the cathedral in Turin from 19 April 2015 until 24 June 2015. There was no charge to view it, but an appointment was required. Conservation The Shroud has undergone several restorations and several steps have been taken to preserve it to avoid further damage and contamination. It is kept under laminated bulletproof glass in an airtight case. The temperature- and humidity-controlled case is filled with argon (99.5%) and oxygen (0.5%) to prevent chemical changes. The Shroud itself is kept on an aluminum support sliding on runners and stored flat within the case. Religious views A poster advertising the 1898 exhibition of the shroud in Turin. Secondo Pia's photograph was taken a few weeks too late to be included in the poster. The image on the poster includes a painted face, not obtained from Pia's photograph. The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke state that Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of Jesus in a piece of linen cloth and placed it in a new tomb. The Gospel of John refers to strips of linen used by Joseph of Arimathea. After the resurrection, the Gospel of John states: \\"Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus‚Äô head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen.\\" The Gospel of Luke states: \\"Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves.\\" Although pieces said to be of burial cloths of Jesus are held by at least four churches in France and three in Italy, none has gathered as much religious following as the Shroud of Turin. The religious beliefs and practices associated with the shroud predate historical and scientific discussions and have continued in the 21st century, although the Catholic Church has never passed judgment on its authenticity. An example is the Holy Face Medal bearing the image from the shroud, worn by some Catholics. Indeed, the Shroud of Turin is respected by Christians of several traditions, including Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Orthodox, Pentecostals, and Presbyterians. Several Lutheran parishes have hosted replicas of the Shroud of Turin, for didactic and devotional purposes. =Devotions= Although the shroud image is currently associated with Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus, the devotions themselves predate Secondo Pia's 1898 photograph. Such devotions had been started in 1844 by the Carmelite nun Marie of St Peter (based on \\"pre-crucifixion\\" images associated with the Veil of Veronica) and promoted by Leo Dupont, also called the Apostle of the Holy Face. In 1851 Dupont formed the \\"Archconfraternity of the Holy Face\\" in Tours, France, well before Secondo Pia took the photograph of the shroud. =Miraculous image= The Vatican Veil of Veronica 17th-century Russian icon of the Mandylion by Simon Ushakov The religious concept of the miraculous acheiropoieton has a long history in Christianity, going back to at least the 6th century. Among the most prominent portable early acheiropoieta are the Image of Camuliana and the Mandylion or Image of Edessa, both painted icons of Christ held in the Byzantine Empire and now generally regarded as lost or destroyed, as is the Hodegetria image of the Virgin Mary. Other early images in Italy, all heavily and unfortunately restored, that have been revered as acheiropoieta now have relatively little following, as attention has focused on the Shroud. Proponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of Resurrection. Some proponents have argued that the image on the shroud can be explained with scientific evidence that supports the Gospel narrative. John Jackson (a member of STURP) proposed that the image was formed by radiation methods beyond the understanding of current science, in particular via the \\"collapsing cloth\\" onto a body that was radiating energy at the moment of resurrection. However, STURP member Alan Adler has stated that Jackson's theory is not generally accepted as scientific, given that it runs counter to the laws of physics. In 1989 physicist Thomas Phillips speculated that the Shroud image was formed by neutron radiation due to a miraculous bodily resurrection. =Vatican position= Antipope Clement VII refrained from expressing his opinion on the shroud; however, subsequent popes from Julius II on took its authenticity for granted. The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano covered the story of Secondo Pia's photograph of 28 May 1898 in its edition of 15 June 1898, but it did so with no comment and thereafter Church officials generally refrained from officially commenting on the photograph for almost half a century. The first official association between the image on the Shroud and the Catholic Church was made in 1940 based on the formal request by Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli to the curia in Milan to obtain authorization to produce a medal with the image. The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to Pope Pius XII who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the Holy Face Medal worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its feast to be celebrated every year the day before Ash Wednesday. Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud. In 1936, Pope Pius XII called the Shroud a \\"holy thing perhaps like nothing else\\", and went on to approve of the devotion accorded to it as the Holy Face of Jesus. Still, in 1998, Pope John Paul II called the Shroud a \\"distinguished relic\\" and \\"a mirror of the Gospel\\". His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, called it an \\"icon written with the blood of a whipped man, crowned with thorns, crucified and pierced on his right side\\". In 2013, Pope Francis referred to it as an \\"icon of a man scourged and crucified\\". Other Christian denominations, such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin. In 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the House of Savoy. However, as with all relics of this kind, the Roman Catholic Church made no pronouncements on its authenticity. As with other approved Catholic devotions, the matter has been left to the personal decision of the faithful, as long as the Church does not issue a future notification to the contrary. In the Church's view, whether the cloth is authentic or not has no bearing whatsoever on the validity of what Jesus taught or on the saving power of his death and resurrection. Pope John Paul II stated in 1998 that: \\"Since it is not a matter of faith, the Church has no specific competence to pronounce on these questions. She entrusts to scientists the task of continuing to investigate, so that satisfactory answers may be found to the questions connected with this Sheet.\\" Pope John Paul II showed himself to be deeply moved by the image of the Shroud and arranged for public showings in 1998 and 2000. In his address at the Turin Cathedral on Sunday 24 May 1998 (the occasion of the 100th year of Secondo Pia's 28 May 1898 photograph), he said: \\"The Shroud is an image of God's love as well as of human sin ... The imprint left by the tortured body of the Crucified One, which attests to the tremendous human capacity for causing pain and death to one's fellow man, stands as an icon of the suffering of the innocent in every age.\\" In 2000, Cardinal Ratzinger, later to become Pope Benedict XVI, wrote that the Shroud of Turin is \\"a truly mysterious image, which no human artistry was capable of producing. In some inexplicable way, it appeared imprinted upon cloth and claimed to show the true face of Christ, the crucified and risen Lord\\". The Shroud was publicly displayed in the spring of 2010; Pope Benedict went to Turin to see it along with other pilgrims. He described the Shroud of Turin as an \\"extraordinary Icon\\", the \\"Icon of Holy Saturday ... corresponding in every way to what the Gospels tell us of Jesus\\", \\"an Icon written in blood, the blood of a man who was scourged, crowned with thorns, crucified and whose right side was pierced\\". The pope said also that in the Turin Shroud \\"we see, as in a mirror, our suffering in the suffering of Christ\\". On 30 May 2010, Benedict XVI beatified Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who coined the Holy Face Medal, based on Secondo Pia's photograph of the Shroud. On 30 March 2013, as part of the Easter celebrations, there was an extraordinary exposition of the shroud in the Cathedral of Turin. Pope Francis recorded a video message for the occasion, in which he described the image on the shroud as \\"this Icon of a man\\", and stated that \\"the Man of the Shroud invites us to contemplate Jesus of Nazareth.\\" In his carefully worded statement Pope Francis urged the faithful to contemplate the shroud with awe, but \\"stopped firmly short of asserting its authenticity\\". Pope Francis went on a pilgrimage to Turin on 21 June 2015, to pray before, venerate the Holy Shroud and honor St. John Bosco on the bicentenary of his birth. Scientific analysis Station biologique de Roscoff in Brittany, France where Yves Delage performed the first scientific analysis of the photographs of the shroud in 1902. Sindonology (from the Greek œÉŒπŒΩŒ¥œéŒΩ‚Äîsindon, the word used in the Gospel of Mark to describe the type of the burial cloth of Jesus) is the formal study of the Shroud. The Oxford English Dictionary cites the first use of this word in 1964: \\"The investigation ... assumed the stature of a separate discipline and was given a name, sindonology,\\" but also identifies the use of \\"sindonological\\" in 1950 and \\"sindonologist\\" in 1953. Secondo Pia's 1898 photographs of the shroud allowed the scientific community to begin to study it. A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: material analysis (both chemical and historical), biology and medical forensics and image analysis. =Early studies= The initial steps towards the scientific study of the shroud were taken soon after the first set of black and white photographs became available early in the 20th century. In 1902 Yves Delage, a French professor of comparative anatomy, published the first study on the subject. Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of rigor mortis, wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage. These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself. The first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969‚Äì1973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973. In 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used image analysis technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the Shroud of Turin Research Project. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud. Also in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at CSELT a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face. =Material chemical analysis= Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin. The carbohydrate layer is visible along top edge. The lower-right edge shows that coating is missing. The coating can be scraped off or removed with adhesive or diimide. Radiocarbon dating After years of discussion, the Holy See permitted radiocarbon dating on portions of a swatch taken from a corner of the shroud. Independent tests in 1988 at the University of Oxford, the University of Arizona, and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology concluded with 95% confidence that the shroud material dated to 1260‚Äì1390 AD. This 13th- to 14th-century dating is much too recent for the shroud to have been associated with Jesus. The dating does on the other hand match the first appearance of the shroud in church history. This dating is also slightly more recent than that estimated by art historian W. S. A. Dale, who postulated on artistic grounds that the shroud is an 11th-century icon made for use in worship services. Some proponents for the authenticity of the shroud have attempted to discount the radiocarbon dating result by claiming that the sample may represent a medieval \\"invisible\\" repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth. However, all of the hypotheses used to challenge the radiocarbon dating have been scientifically refuted, including the medieval repair hypothesis, the bio-contamination hypothesis and the carbon monoxide hypothesis. In recent years several statistical analyses have been conducted on the radiocarbon dating data, attempting to draw some conclusions about the reliability of the C14 dating from studying the data rather than studying the shroud itself. They have all concluded that the data shows a lack of homogeneity, which might be due to unidentified abnormalities in the fabric tested, or else might be due to differences in the pre-testing cleaning processes used by the different laboratories. The most recent analysis (2020) concludes that the stated date range needs to be adjusted by up to 88 years in order to properly meet the requirement of \\"95% confidence\\". Tests for pigments In the 1970s a special eleven-member Turin Commission conducted several tests. Conventional and electron microscopic examination of the Shroud at that time revealed an absence of heterogeneous coloring material or pigment. In 1979, Walter McCrone, upon analyzing the samples he was given by STURP, concluded that the image is actually made up of billions of submicrometre pigment particles. The only fibrils that had been made available for testing of the stains were those that remained affixed to custom-designed adhesive tape applied to thirty-two different sections of the image. Mark Anderson, who was working for McCrone, analyzed the Shroud samples. In his book Ray Rogers states that Anderson, who was McCrone's Raman microscopy expert, concluded that the samples acted as organic material when he subjected them to the laser. John Heller and Alan Adler examined the same samples and agreed with McCrone's result that the cloth contains iron oxide. However, they concluded, the exceptional purity of the chemical and comparisons with other ancient textiles showed that, while retting flax absorbs iron selectively, the iron itself was not the source of the image on the shroud. =Material historical analysis= Historical fabrics Roman loom, c. 2nd century AD In 1998, shroud researcher Joe Nickell wrote that no examples of herringbone weave are known from the time of Jesus. The few samples of burial cloths that are known from the era are made using plain weave. In 2000, fragments of a burial shroud from the 1st century were discovered in a tomb near Jerusalem, believed to have belonged to a Jewish high priest or member of the aristocracy. The shroud was composed of a simple two-way weave, unlike the complex herringbone twill of the Turin Shroud. Based on this discovery, the researchers stated that the Turin Shroud did not originate from Jesus-era Jerusalem. According to textile expert Mechthild Flury-Lemberg of Hamburg, a seam in the cloth corresponds to a fabric found at the fortress of Masada near the Dead Sea, which dated to the 1st century. The weaving pattern, 3:1 twill, is consistent with first-century Syrian design, according to the appraisal of Gilbert Raes of the Ghent Institute of Textile Technology in Belgium. Flury- Lemberg stated: \\"The linen cloth of the Shroud of Turin does not display any weaving or sewing techniques which would speak against its origin as a high- quality product of the textile workers of the first century.\\" Dirt particles A piece of travertine. Joseph Kohlbeck from the Hercules Aerospace Company in Utah and Richard Levi-Setti of the Enrico Fermi Institute examined some dirt particles from the Shroud surface. The dirt was found to be travertine aragonite limestone. =Biological and medical forensics= Blood stains There are several reddish stains on the shroud suggesting blood, but it is uncertain whether these stains were produced at the same time as the image, or afterwards. McCrone (see painting hypothesis) identified these as containing iron oxide, theorizing that its presence was likely due to simple pigment materials used in medieval times. Other researchers, including Alan Adler, identified the reddish stains as blood and interpreted the iron oxide as a natural residue of hemoglobin. Working independently, forensic pathologist Pier Luigi Baima Bollone concurred with Heller and Adler's findings and identified the blood as the AB blood group. Joe Nickell argues that results similar to Heller and Adler's could be obtained from tempera paint. Skeptics also cite other forensic blood tests whose results dispute the authenticity of the Shroud, and point to the possibility that the blood could belong to a person who handled the shroud, and that the apparent blood flows on the shroud are unrealistically neat. Flowers and pollen Chrysanthemum coronarium, now called Glebionis coronaria In 1997 Avinoam Danin, a botanist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, reported that he had identified Chrysanthemum coronarium (now called Glebionis coronaria), Cistus creticus and Zygophyllum whose pressed image on the shroud was first noticed by Alan Whanger in 1985 on the photographs of the shroud taken in 1931. He reported that the outlines of the flowering plants would point to March or April and the environs of Jerusalem. In a separate report in 1978 Danin and Uri Baruch reported on the pollen grains on the cloth samples, stating that they were appropriate to the spring in Israel. Max Frei, a Swiss police criminologist who initially obtained pollen from the shroud during the STURP investigation, stated that of the 58 different types of pollens found, 45 were from the Jerusalem area, while six were from the eastern Middle East, with one pollen species growing exclusively in Istanbul, and two found in Edessa, Turkey. Mark Antonacci argues that the pollen evidence and flower images are inherently interwoven and strengthen each other. However it was subsequently determined that Baruch's work was \\"scientifically unsafe\\", and Danin thereafter disowned the publication of this work. Danin stated in 2011, that: \\"In 2001 we brought most of the slides to Prof. Dr. Thomas Litt who is an expert palynologist and has very sophisticated microscopic equipment. Prof. Litt concluded that none of the pollen grains he saw could be named at a species level. Hence, all the conclusions drawn from previous palynological investigations of Dr. Frei's material should be suspended until a new collection of pollen grains can be carried out and the grains thus obtained can be studied with modern equipment and by an expert of pollen of this area.\\" Skeptics have argued that the flower images are too faint for Danin's determination to be definite, that an independent review of the pollen strands showed that one strand out of the 26 provided contained significantly more pollen than the others, perhaps pointing to deliberate contamination. Skeptics also argue that Max Frei had previously been duped in his examination of the Hitler Diaries and that he may have also been duped in this case, or may have introduced the pollens himself. J. Beaulieau has stated that Frei was a self-taught amateur palynologist, was not properly trained, and that his sample was too small. In 2008 Avinoam Danin reported analysis based on the ultraviolet photographs of Miller and Pellicori taken in 1978. Danin reported five new species of flower, which also bloom in March and April and stated that a comparison of the 1931 black and white photographs and the 1978 ultraviolet images indicate that the flower images are genuine and not the artifact of a specific method of photography. A study published in 2011 by Lorusso and others subjected two photographs of the shroud to detailed modern digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any images of flowers or coins or anything else on either image, they noted that the faint images identified by the Whangers were \\"only visible by incrementing the photographic contrast\\", and they concluded that these signs may be linked to protuberances in the yarn, and possibly also to the alteration and influence of the texture of the Enrie photographic negative during its development in 1931. In 2015, Italian researchers Barcaccia et al. published a new study in Scientific Reports. They examined the human and non-human DNA found when the shroud and its backing cloth were vacuumed in 1977 and 1988. They found traces of 19 different plant taxa, including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human mtDNA, sequences were found belonging to haplogroups that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India. A few non- plant and non-human sequences were also detected, including various birds and one ascribable to a marine worm common in the Northern Pacific Ocean, next to Canada. After sequencing some DNA of pollen and dust found on the shroud, they confirmed that many people from many different places came in contact with the shroud. According to the scientists, \\"such diversity does not exclude a Medieval origin in Europe but it would be also compatible with the historic path followed by the Turin Shroud during its presumed journey from the Near East. Furthermore, the results raise the possibility of an Indian manufacture of the linen cloth.\\" In 2017, a new examination claimed that \\"the most abundant pollen on the relic may be attribruted to the genus Helichrysum\\". According to the author, palynologist Marzia Boi, it \\"confirms and authenticates the theory that the corpse kept in the Shroud received a funeral and burial with all the honour and respect that would have been customary in the Hebrew tradition\\". Anatomical forensics Full length negatives of the shroud. A number of studies on the anatomical consistency of the image on the shroud and the nature of the wounds on it have been performed, following the initial study by Yves Delage in 1902. While Delage declared the image anatomically flawless, others have presented arguments to support both authenticity and forgery. In 1950 Pierre Barbet wrote a long study called A Doctor at Calvary which was later published as a book. Barbet stated that his experience as a battlefield surgeon during World War I led him to conclude that the image on the shroud was authentic, anatomically correct and consistent with crucifixion. For over a decade, Frederick Zugibe performed a number of studies using himself and volunteers suspended from a cross, and presented his conclusions in a book in 1998. Zugibe considered the shroud image and its proportions as authentic, but disagreed with Barbet and Bucklin on various details such as blood flow. Zugibe concluded that the image on the shroud is of the body of a man, but that the body had been washed. In 2001, Pierluigi Baima Bollone, a professor of forensic medicine in Turin, stated that the forensic examination of the wounds and bloodstains on the Shroud indicate that the image was that of the dead body of a man who was whipped, wounded around the head by a pointed instrument, and nailed at the extremities before dying. In 2010 Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical measurements, wrote that \\"apart from the hands afterward placed on the pubic area, the front and back images are compatible with the Shroud being used to wrap the body of a man tall, which, due to cadaveric rigidity, remained in the same position it would have assumed during crucifixion\\". Joe Nickell in 1983, and Gregory S. Paul in 2010, separately state that the proportions of the image are not realistic. Paul stated that the face and proportions of the shroud image are impossible, that the figure cannot represent that of an actual person and that the posture was inconsistent. They argued that the forehead on the shroud is too small; and that the arms are too long and of different lengths and that the distance from the eyebrows to the top of the head is non-representative. They concluded that the features can be explained if the shroud is a work of a Gothic artist. A 2013 study analysed the wounds seemingly evident on the image in the shroud and compared them favorably to the wounds which the gospels state were inflicted on Jesus. However, the analysis of a crucified Roman, discovered near Venice in 2007, shows heel wounds consistent with those found on Jehohanan and are not consistent with wounds depicted on the shroud. Also, neither of the crucifixion victims known to archaeology show evidence of wrist wounds. In 2018 an experimental Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) was performed to study the behaviour of blood flows from the wounds of a crucified person, and to compare this to the evidence on the Turin Shroud. The comparison between different tests demonstrated that the blood patterns on the forearms and on the back of the hand are not connected, and would have had to occur at different times, as a result of a very specific sequence of movements. In addition, the rivulets on the front of the image are not consistent with the lines on the lumbar area, even supposing there might have been different episodes of bleeding at different times. These inconsistencies suggest that the Turin linen was an artistic or \\"didactic\\" representation, rather than an authentic burial shroud. =Image and text analysis= Image analysis Both art-historical, digital image processing and analog techniques have been applied to the shroud images. In 1976 Pete Schumacher, John Jackson and Eric Jumper analysed a photograph of the shroud image using a VP8 Image Analyzer, which was developed for NASA to create brightness maps of the moon. A brightness map (isometric display) interprets differences of brightness within an image as differences of elevation‚Äîbrighter patches are seen as being closer to the camera and darker patches as farther away. Our minds interpret these gradients as a \\"pseudo-three-dimensional image\\". They found that, unlike any photograph they had analyzed, the shroud image has the property of decoding into a 3-dimensional image, when the darker parts of the image are interpreted to be those features of the man that were closest to the shroud and the lighter areas of the image those features that were farthest. The researchers could not replicate the effect when they attempted to transfer similar images using techniques of block print, engravings, a hot statue, and bas-relief. However optical physicist and former STURP member John Dee German has since noted that it is not difficult to make a photograph which has 3D qualities. If the object being photographed is lighted from the front, and a non-reflective \\"fog\\" of some sort exists between the camera and the object, then less light will reach and reflect back from the portions of the object that are farther from the lens, thus creating a contrast which is dependent on distance. Researchers Jackson, Jumper, and Stephenson report detecting the impressions of coins placed on both eyes after a digital study in 1978. They claimed to have seen a two-lepton coin on the right eyelid dating from 29‚Äì30, and a one-lepton coin on the left eyebrow minted in 29. The existence of the coin images is rejected by most scientists. A study published in 2011 by Lorusso and others subjected two photographs of the shroud to detailed modern digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any images of flowers or coins or any other additional objects on the shroud in either photograph, they noted that the faint images identified by the Whangers were \\"only visible by incrementing the photographic contrast\\", and they concluded that these signs may be linked to protuberances in the yarn, and possibly also to the alteration and influence of the texture of the Enrie photographic negative during its development in 1931. The use of coins to cover the eyes of the dead is not attested for 1st-century Palestine. In 2004, in an article in Journal of Optics A, Fanti and Maggiolo reported finding a faint second face on the backside of the cloth, after the 2002 restoration. The front image of the Turin Shroud, 1.95 m long, is not directly compatible with the back image, 2.02 m long. If Jesus' dead body actually produced the images on the shroud, one would expect the bodily areas touching the ground to be more distinct. In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. However, medical studies of the image speculate that the man's right humerus may have been dislocated, which could potentially account for the right arm lowering. No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body. For comparison, see oshiguma; the making of face-prints as an artform, in Japan. Furthermore, Jesus' physical appearance corresponds to Byzantine iconography. Claims of writing on the Shroud A late 19th-century photograph of the Chapel of the Holy Shroud In 1979 Greek and Latin letters were reported as written near the face. These were further studied by Andr√© Marion, a professor at the √âcole sup√©rieure d'optique and his student Anne Laure Courage, in 1997. Subsequently, after performing computerized analysis and microdensitometer studies, they reported finding additional inscriptions, among them INNECEM (a shortened form of Latin \\"in necem ibis\\"‚Äî\\"you will go to death\\"), NNAZAPE(N)NUS (Nazarene), IHSOY (Jesus) and IC (Iesus Chrestus). The uncertain letters IBE(R?) have been conjectured as \\"Tiberius\\". Linguist Mark Guscin disputed the reports of Marion and Courage. He stated that the inscriptions made little grammatical or historical sense and that they did not appear on the slides that Marion and Courage indicated. In 2009, Barbara Frale, a paleographer in the Vatican Secret Archives, who had published two books on the Shroud of Turin reported further analysis of the text. In her books Frale had stated that the shroud had been kept by the Templars after 1204. In 2009 Frale stated that it is possible to read on the image the burial certificate of Jesus the Nazarene, or Jesus of Nazareth, imprinted in fragments of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin writing. Frale stated the text on the Shroud reads: \\"In the year 16 of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius Jesus the Nazarene, taken down in the early evening after having been condemned to death by a Roman judge because he was found guilty by a Hebrew authority, is hereby sent for burial with the obligation of being consigned to his family only after one full year.\\" Since Tiberius became emperor after the death of Octavian Augustus in AD 14, the 16th year of his reign would be within the span of the years AD 30 to 31. Frale's methodology has been criticized, partly based on the objection that the writings are too faint to see. Dr Antonio Lombatti, an Italian historian, rejected the idea that the authorities would have bothered to tag the body of a crucified man. He stated that \\"It's all the result of imagination and computer software.\\" A study by Lorusso et al. subjected two photographs of the shroud to digital image processing, one of them being a reproduction of the photographic negative taken by Giuseppe Enrie in 1931. They did not find any signs, symbols or writing on either image, and noted that these signs may be linked to protuberances in the yarn, as well possibly as to the alteration and influence of the texture of the Enrie photographic negative during its development in 1931. =Hypotheses on image origin=  Painting  The technique used for producing the image is, according to Walter McCrone, described in a book about medieval painting published in 1847 by Charles Lock Eastlake (Methods and Materials of Painting of the Great Schools and Masters). Eastlake describes in the chapter \\"Practice of Painting Generally During the XIVth Century\\" a special technique of painting on linen using tempera paint, which produces images with unusual transparent features‚Äîwhich McCrone compares to the image on the shroud. Pro-authenticity journals have declared this hypothesis to be unsound, stating that X-ray fluorescence examination, as well as infrared thermography, did not reveal any pigment. The non-paint origin has been further examined by Fourier transform of the image: common paintings show a directionality that is absent from the Turin Shroud.  Acid pigmentation  In 2009, Luigi Garlaschelli, professor of organic chemistry at the University of Pavia, stated that he had made a full size reproduction of the Shroud of Turin using only medieval technologies. Garlaschelli placed a linen sheet over a volunteer and then rubbed it with an acidic pigment. The shroud was then aged in an oven before being washed to remove the pigment. He then added blood stains, scorches and water stains to replicate the original. Giulio Fanti, professor of mechanical and thermic measurements at the University of Padua, commented that \\"the technique itself seems unable to produce an image having the most critical Turin Shroud image characteristics\\". Garlaschelli's reproduction was shown in a 2010 National Geographic documentary. Garlaschelli's technique included the bas-relief approach (described below) but only for the image of the face. The resultant image was visibly similar to the Turin Shroud, though lacking the uniformity and detail of the original. Medieval photography According to the art historian Nicholas Allen, the image on the shroud was formed by a photographic technique in the 13th century. Allen maintains that techniques already available before the 14th century‚Äîe.g., as described in the Book of Optics, which was at just that time translated from Arabic to Latin‚Äîwere sufficient to produce primitive photographs, and that people familiar with these techniques would have been able to produce an image as found on the shroud. To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis, in papers published in several science journals, and in a book. Silver bromide is believed by some to have been used for making the Shroud of Turin as it is widely used in photographic films. Dust-transfer technique Scientists Emily Craig and Randall Bresee have attempted to recreate the likenesses of the shroud through the dust-transfer technique, which could have been done by medieval arts. They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three- dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes. However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level. Bas-relief In 1978, Joe Nickell noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a bas-relief might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in Popular Photography magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step. Other researchers later replicated this process. In 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of ferric oxide and gelatine. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide. Instead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object‚Äîthus producing an all-or- nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud. According to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the histograms of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). Maillard reaction The Maillard reaction is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The cellulose fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin carbohydrate layer of starch fractions, various sugars, and other impurities. In a paper entitled \\"The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction may explain the image formation,\\" Raymond Rogers and Anna Arnoldi propose that amines from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid decomposition products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as putrescine and cadaverine. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body, and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud. Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas. Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion. Alan A. Mills argued that the image was formed by the chemical reaction auto- oxidation. He noted that the image corresponds to what would have been produced by a volatile chemical if the intensity of the color change were inversely proportional to the distance from the body of a loosely draped cloth. Energy source Since 1930 several researchers (J. Jackson, G. Fanti, T. Trenn, T. Phillips, J.-B. Rinaudo and others) endorsed the flash- like irradiation hypothesis. It was suggested that the relatively high definition of the image details can be obtained through the energy source (specifically, protonic) acting from inside. The Russian researcher Alexander Belyakov proposed an intense, but short flashlight source, which lasted some hundredths of a second. Some other authors suggest the X-radiation or a burst of directional ultraviolet radiation may have played a role in the formation of the Shroud image. From the image characteristics, several researchers have theorized that the radiant source was prevalently vertical. These theories do not include the scientific discussion of a method by which the energy could have been produced. =Corona discharge= During restoration in 2002, the back of the cloth was photographed and scanned for the first time. Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the University of Padua, wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic corona discharge as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud. Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body. Raymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \\"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin. Corona discharges and/or plasmas made no contribution to image formation.\\" In December 2011, Fanti published a critical compendium of the major hypotheses regarding the formation of the body image on the shroud. He stated that \\"none of them can completely explain the mysterious image\\". Fanti then considered corona discharge as the most probable hypothesis regarding the formation of the body image. He stated that it would be impossible to reproduce all the characteristics of the image in a laboratory because the energy source required would be too high. Fanti has restated the radiation theories in a 2013 book. =Ultraviolet radiation= In December 2011 scientists at Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Development ENEA deduced from the STURP results that the color of the Shroud image is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen, similar to the yellowing of the paper of ancient books. They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to ultraviolet light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation. Paolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \\"... it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web. Professional skeptic Joe Nickell states that the latest findings are nothing new despite being \\"dressed up in high-tech tests\\", and that they don't prove much of anything. =Burial ointments= In November 2011, F. Curciarello et al. published a paper that analyzed the abrupt changes in the yellowed fibril density values on the Shroud image. They concluded that the rapid changes in the body image intensity are not anomalies in the manufacturing process of the linen but that they can be explained with the presence of aromas or burial ointments. However, their work leaves the existence of an energy source for the image an open question. Replica of the Shroud of Turin, found in the Real Santuario del Cristo de La Laguna in Tenerife (Spain).

She is best known for her work in comic books. As an editor for Marvel Comics, she edited New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men. With artist collaborators, she created such Marvel characters as Typhoid Mary, Blackheart, Longshot, Mojo, and Spiral. Nocenti is particularly noted for her outspoken political views. Some focus on the status of women in society, as well as the role of government in Nocenti's work, particularly during her run on the Marvel superhero comic book Daredevil, which caused conflict with her editors. Early life When Ann Nocenti was a child, her parents frowned upon comics, though there were some in her house, including Archie Comics, a \\"Pogo\\" anthology that Nocenti loved, and a Dick Tracy anthology whose grotesquely-rendered characters piqued Nocenti's curiosity, more so than the heroes. Nocenti attended college at SUNY New Paltz, during which she discovered the work of Robert Crumb. Career = Comics = After graduating from SUNY New Paltz, she discovered the superhero genre when she answered an ad in the Village Voice, which led to her being given her first published comics job at Marvel Comics by editor Dennis O'Neil. Nocenti made her comics writing debut with a six-page mythological story, drawn by Greg LaRocque, in the Marvel anthology Bizarre Adventures #32 (August 1982). She got her first regular comics assignment with Marvel's superhero series Spider-Woman, starting with issue #47 (December 1982). It was not a promising assignment; Marvel had already decided to end the series with issue #50 (June 1983) due to flagging sales. With heavy guidance from editor Mark Gruenwald (who had himself written the series for a time), Nocenti ended the series with the death of the titular character, a decision she came to regret. She recalled, \\"It was before I understood the intense, personal attachment the readers have to the characters. In retrospect, I realized it wasn't a nice thing to kill a character off. As I worked in the field for a while, I developed a strong personal attachment to a lot of characters and I realized how alive they were.\\" Shortly after, Nocenti lent a hand to Spider-Woman's resurrection in Avengers #240‚Äì241 as \\"story consultant\\". She wrote an issue each of Doctor Strange and Star Wars before writing the four-issue miniseries Beauty and the Beast (December 1984 ‚Äì June 1985), featuring the superheroes Dazzler and the Beast. During this period Nocenti was on staff at Marvel, working as an assistant editor for Carl Potts\\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel comics cover-dated February 1984. on such titles as The Incredible Hulk, The Defenders, Doctor Strange, and The Thing. Nocenti with Whilce Portacio and Arthur Adams at the 2015 East Coast Comicon, during the 30th anniversary year of their collaboration on Longshot, and the first time they had appeared in public together since publication of that miniseries Nocenti and artist Arthur Adams created the character Longshot in a titular, six-issue miniseries (September 1985 ‚Äì February 1986). Explaining the concept of the character, which Nocenti borrowed from existentialist writers, she states, \\"Longshot is the idea of stripping someone of everything that they are. I never read comics, so the idea of a hero to me was different. I couldn't think of it in terms of a 'super hero' hero. I thought of it more as a conceptual hero. Not having a comic book background, I tend to come up with the metaphysics before I come up with the characters. I knew that I wanted to deal with the metaphysics of luck. It was a concept that interested me ... what luck is, what probability is, how you could shift probabilities towards yourself. What are the repercussions of that? So, I did a character centered around that idea.Ringgenberg, Steve (August 1985). Marvel Age #29. p. 13‚Äì15. At the time, Nocenti was pursuing her Master's degree at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, working at the magazine Lies of Our Times, and reading the work of writers such as Marshall McLuhan, Noam Chomsky, Edward S. Herman and Walter Lippmann. Longshot's archvillain, Mojo, a slaver and dictator who rules his dimension through the television programs he produces, was created as a direct result of these influences. A character named Manufactured Consent after the Chomsky book of the same name, who appeared in the Nocenti's 1990 book The New Mutants Summer Special in 1990, was also born of these works.Keller, Katherine (November 2, 2007). \\"Writer, Creator, Journalist, and Uppity Woman: Ann Nocenti\\". Sequential Tart. After collaborating with Adams on the Spider-Man feature in Web of Spider-Man Annual #2 (September 1986), and with penciler Mike Mignola on a short backup story there, Nocenti teamed with artist Barry Windsor-Smith on Daredevil #236 (November 1986). Two issues later, she became the regular writer for a four- and-a-quarter year run from #238‚Äì291 (January 1987 ‚Äì April 1991), minus issues #246 and #258. John Romita Jr. joined as penciler from #250‚Äì282 (January 1988 ‚Äì July 1990), and was generally inked by Al Williamson. Nocenti specifically addressed societal issues, with Murdock, now running a non-profit urban legal center, confronting sexism, racism, and nuclear proliferation while fighting supervillains. Nocenti introduced the popular antagonist Typhoid Mary in issue #254 (May 1988).DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 237: \\"Mary was first introduced in Daredevil #254 by Ann Nocenti and artist John Romita Jr.\\" as well as the demon Blackheart in #270 (September 1989).DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 242 In addition to contributing occasional stories to such anthologies as Marvel Comics Presents and Marvel Fanfare, and writing a handful of Spider-Man fill-ins, Nocenti also produced the graphic novel Someplace Strange in collaboration with artist John Bolton. She also wrote The Inhumans Graphic Novel in 1988, and the 1998 X-Men novel Prisoner X. For the DC Comics imprint Vertigo, Nocenti wrote the 16-issue run of Kid Eternity (May 1993 ‚Äì September 1994). Later in the mid-1990s, for Marvel, she wrote a four- issue miniseries each starring Typhoid Mary and the supernatural supervillain Nightmare. After writing two issues of Marvel's The All New Exiles in 1996, plus the four-page dramatic story \\"Old Man\\", with artist Bolton, in the Dark Horse Comics anthology Strange Wink #3 (May 1998), Nocenti left comics to pursue journalism. She returned briefly, in 2003 and 2004, writing four Batman stories for DC. Nocenti was among the writers for Daredevil #500 published in August 2009. Nocenti wrote Green Arrow starting with issue #7 published in March 2012. In September 2012, Nocenti became the writer of Catwoman with issue #0. She launched a Katana series the following February.Manning \\"2010s\\" in Dougall, p. 336: Katana #1 \\"This issue was written by Ann Nocenti and drawn by Alex Sanchez.\\" = Journalism and film = In 1990s, Nocenti began to focus on journalism and filmmaking. She edited High Times magazine for one year (2004) and was an editor on Prison Life Magazine. Her journalism has been published in The Nation, Print, Utne, Heeb, The Brooklyn Rail, CounterPunch, Filmmaker, and Details, as well for MoveOn.org. Nocenti's story \\"The Most Expensive Road Trip in the World\\" was collected in The Best American Travel Writing 2008, edited by Anthony Bourdain (Houghton Miifflin). She was an editor and writer for Stop Smiling, guest editing the \\"Gambling Issue\\". As editor of the screenwriting magazine Scenario, Nocenti published the original versions of screenplays and interviewed directors and screenwriters. Nocenti co-directed the documentary The Baluch, shot in Baluchistan, and made the short Creep for Glass Eye Pix. In 2009, Nocenti taught screenplay writing at the Cin√© Institute in Haiti and in 2012 wrote a series for HiLobrow about the country. Nocenti made a short documentary film with Wendy Johnson called Disarming Falcons in 2014 which premiered at DOCNYC. In 2016 she was one of the producers and writers on MAGIC CITY: The Art of the Street, for SC Exhibitions in Dresden, Germany. In 2018 she was an executive producer on MARVEL: Universe of Super-Heroes at MoPOP museum in Seattle, Washington. In 2018 she wrote The Seeds (with artist David Aja) and in 2019 she wrote Ruby Falls (with artist Flavia Biondi), both for Karen Berger‚Äôs new comic imprint Berger Books at Dark Horse Comics.  Cameos and homages  Nocenti appears on the photo cover of Spider-Woman #50, in costume as Tigra. Nocenti appears in The Avengers #215 (Jan. 1982) as a secretary at an advertising agency that Steve Rogers visits looking for work. Nocenti makes a cameo appearance in The Incredible Hulk #291 (January 1984). At the time Nocenti was assistant editor to Larry Hama on The Incredible Hulk and X-Men. She also appeared in a spoof comic strip in 1984's The Defenders #127. Arthur Adams visually based the character Ricochet Rita in the Longshot limited series on Nocenti. In Ultimate X-Men, a re-imagination of the X-Men in the alternate universe Ultimate Marvel imprint, the superhero Longshot has the civilian name Arthur Centino ‚Äî his last name an anagram of \\"Nocenti\\" and his first name an homage to artist Arthur Adams, the original character's co-creators.

He received his PhD in Political Science at Yale University in 1963, after studying at Principia College from 1955 to 1958. He is currently Research Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the University of California, San Diego. Dutch by birth, he has spent most of his working life in the United States and became an American citizen. He has since regained his Dutch citizenship and is now a dual citizen of both the Netherlands and the United States. Major works Lijphart is the leading authority on consociationalism, or the ways in which segmented societies manage to sustain democracy through power-sharing. Lijphart developed this concept in his first major work, The Politics of Accommodation, a study of the Dutch political system, and further developed his arguments in Democracy in Plural Societies. His later work has focused on the broader contrasts between majoritarian and \\"consensus\\" democracies. While Lijphart advocated consociationalism primarily for societies deeply divided along ethnic, religious, ideological, or other cleavages, he sees consensus democracy as appropriate for any society with a consensual political culture. In contrast to majoritarian democracies, consensus democracies have multiparty systems, parliamentarism with oversized (and therefore inclusive) cabinet coalitions, proportional electoral systems, corporatist (hierarchical) interest group structures, federal structures, bicameralism, rigid constitutions protected by judicial review, and independent central banks. These institutions ensure, firstly, that only a broad supermajority can control policy and, secondly, that once a coalition takes power, its ability to infringe on minority rights is limited. In Patterns of Democracy (1999, 2nd ed., 2012), Lijphart classifies thirty-six democracies using these attributes. He finds consensus democracies to be \\"kinder, gentler\\" states, having lower incarceration rates, less use of the death penalty, better care for the environment, more foreign aid work, and more welfare spending ‚Äì qualities he feels \\"should appeal to all democrats\\". He also finds that consensus democracies have a less abrasive political culture, more functional business- like proceedings, and a results-oriented ethic. The 2012 edition included data up to 2010 and found proportional representation (PR) was vastly superior for the \\"quality of democracy\\", being statistically significantly better for 19 of 19 indicators. On the issue of ‚Äúeffective government‚Äù 16 out of 17 indicators pointed to PR as superior, with 9 out of 17 statistically significant. These results held up when controlling for the level of development and population size. Lijphart has also made influential contributions to methodological debates within comparative politics, most notably through his 1971 article 'Comparative politics and the comparative method', published in the American Political Science Review. Honours In 1989, Lijphart was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and from 1995 to 1996 served as President of the American Political Science Association. In 1993 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the prestigious Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science in 1997.

Graustark's neighbors, which also figure in the stories, are Axphain to the north and Dawsbergen to the south. Description Graustark is described as a mountainous country with an area of approximately ; there is at least one reference in the books that fixes its location as somewhere in the Carpathian Mountains near Romania. On the other hand, in Graustark it is said to be threatened with reduction to being only 25 miles wide by 150 miles long (3750 square miles) and in Truxton King is said to provide a shorter rail route to Russian territories in or near Afghanistan. Graustark's capital city, Edelweiss, is accessible by train from Vienna. The mountain town of Ganlook is near the border with Axphain, Graustark's traditional enemy. Graustark is ruled as a principality and its unit of currency is called the gavvo, worth $1.40 at the time of the novel Truxton King. Graustarkian is the native language of the people, although American English is universally spoken among the educated classes and is the everyday language of the royal family and court. Novels The Graustark novels are stories of court intrigue, royal disguise, and romance similar to Anthony Hope's 1894 novel, The Prisoner of Zenda, and its sequels. They were popular best-sellers at the time they were published and the original editions are still readily available in used book shops. The two authors' novels gave their name to a fictional genre called either Ruritanian romance based on The Prisoner of Zenda, or \\"Graustarkian,\\"\\"a highly romantic piece of writing,\\" http://merriam-webster.com . Accessed 2020 September 14. from McCutcheon's novels. This genre contains tales of romance and intrigue usually featuring titled characters in small, fictional, Central European or East European countries. The novels in McCutcheon's series are: * Graustark: The Story of a Love Behind a Throne (1901) Gutenberg text * Beverly of Graustark (1904) Gutenberg text (filmed in 1926 with Marion Davies) * Truxton King: A Story of Graustark (1909) Gutenberg etext in HTML * The Prince of Graustark (1914) Gutenberg text * East of the Setting Sun (1924) * The Inn of the Hawk and Raven (1927) In 2009, issue 31 of McSweeney's featured a Graustarkian short story, as part of a series on lost literary forms. The story, Feasts and Villains, was written by John Brandon.  History of Graustark  During the 1870s, Graustark's ruler, Prince Ganlook of Graustark, was killed in a war with neighboring Axphain. As part of the ensuing peace treaty, Graustark agreed to pay a large indemnity to Axphain, to be due, with interest, in fifteen years. Graustark found itself without the resources to pay the indemnity when it was due, and in desperation, Princess Yetive‚ÄîGanlook's daughter and now occupying Graustark's throne‚Äîwas on the verge of contracting a state marriage to Prince Lorenz of Axphain in exchange for more favorable payment terms. But before the marriage could take place, Lorenz was murdered. The princess's true love, the American Grenfall Lorry, whom she had met while travelling in the United States appeared to be the murderer. Lorenz's father insisted on the murderer's punishment, but the execution was prevented by the revelation of the true murderer: the villainous Prince Gabriel, ruler of Dawsbergen, who was another of Yetive's suitors. With Lorenz dead and Gabriel imprisoned, Yetive instead married her true love. During Gabriel's imprisonment, Dawsbergen was ruled by his younger half- brother, Prince Dantan, a popular figure among his own people and a staunch friend of Graustark as well. But after two years, Gabriel escaped from prison and, supported by the Dawsbergen army, returned to the throne. Dantan was forced to go into hiding in disguise in Graustark. For a time it appeared that Graustark might be forced into war with both Dawsbergen and Axphain, but this was averted when Gabriel was recaptured. Meanwhile, the disguised Prince Dantan had fallen in love with Beverly Calhoun, an American guest of the Lorrys; they were married upon his restoration to the throne of Dawsbergen. Yetive and her husband were tragically killed in a railway accident near Brussels, leaving their young son Prince Robin as ruler of Graustark. While still a child, Robin was the target of an assassination plot by anarchists acting under the direction of the exiled Count Marlanx, whose ultimate goal was to establish himself as sole dictator of Graustark. But the assassination attempt was foiled by the intervention of the American Truxton King, and Marlanx was killed in the ensuing attack on the royal palace. Graustark was still in financial difficulties by the time Prince Robin reached adulthood. William W. Blithers, a very rich and very vulgar American, offered to finance the country in the hopes of arranging a marriage between Robin and his own daughter. The two principals, however, had very different ideas of their own about marriage. Robin eventually married Bevra, the Crown Princess of Dawsbergen, daughter of Dantan and Beverly. Graustark's debts eventually ended up being held by Russia. In exchange for entering World War I as Russia's ally, Graustark negotiated cancellation of this debt. Later, with Russia out of the war, Graustark also negotiated a separate peace. There followed a period of prosperity in the country. Axphain, however, was taken over by communists after the war, and was in a state of much distress and unrest. Its ruler, Prince Hedrik (brother of Lorenz), and his elder son were murdered in the communist revolution, leaving the younger son Prince Hubert in exile in Graustark and an illegitimate son Gregory who lived with his mother in Italy. Hubert was hoping to marry Princess Virginia of Dawsbergen‚ÄîBevra's younger sister‚Äîbut she had previously contracted a marriage of convenience to Pendennis Yorke, an American journalist, and much to the surprise of everyone it became a genuine love match. The communist regime in Axphain was defeated after an unsuccessful attempt to invade Graustark, and the monarchy in that country was restored with Gregory on the throne rather than the unpopular Hubert, who was himself assassinated in the aftermath. In the classic novel Three Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson, the hero Holger Carlsen gives his hastily constructed alias as 'Sir Rupert of Graustark.' On film * Graustark (1915) * ' was made as a film in 1916 at the Chicago Essanay Studios, and is of note because it is claimed that Colleen Moore has a quick, uncredited role as a maid in the background of one scene. Some historians, viewing the scene, are convinced the girl is. Others have seen stills of the scene and do not see the resemblance at all. As such, this is not considered to be one of her film roles, though she did spend some summers in Chicago growing up, and could easily have been an extra in this film.Jeff Codori (2012), Colleen Moore; A Biography of the Silent Film Star, McFarland Publishing , Print , EBook . * Truxton King (1923) * Graustark (1925)Stanford University film entry * Beverly of Graustark (1926) Footnotes  See also  * George Barr McCutcheon External links * Fictional European countries Novel series American novels adapted into films Fictional principalities ","title":"Graustark"},{"id":"998812","text":"Aarburg is a historic town and a municipality in the district of Zofingen in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland. The small town lies in the southwest Aargau, in a narrow section of the Aare valley, at the confluence with the Wigger. It lies in the intersection of the most important traffic routes of Switzerland. The dominant landmark is the Aarburg Castle, one of Switzerland's largest castles and a heritage site of national significance. The visual character of Aarburg is shaped by the fortification and the church on a rock spur. The official language of Aarburg is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. History Aarburg Castle In Roman times a road went by Aarburg, connecting the Olten region with the rest of inner Switzerland. During the construction of a factory in the 20th century, a hoard of coins produced during the reign of Emperor Tetricus I was discovered. The coin hoard was probably buried during the Bagauden Invasions in 284 CE. When, precisely, the fortress of Aarburg was constructed on the rocky outcropping is unknown. The first time it was documented was in 1123 when it is mentioned as Areburc. At the time it was the property of the Grafen von Frohburg family. From this castle the Bailiwick of Aarburg was governed, what is today the western part of the county of Zofingen, though not the town of Zofigen itself. In 1299 the Frohburgs sold the castle and the Bailiwick of Aarburg to the Habsburg family. The settlement at the foot of the castle was clearly identified as a town in the year 1330. Archeological evidence has shown that the town was probably founded around the year 1312. Wedged between the cities of Olten and Zofingen, with only four kilometers between them, Aarburg could not develop commercially and remained a small town. The people of Aarburg lived mainly on the tariff revenues that commerce along the Gotthard Pass provided. A small harbor on the river Aare was constructed in 1361. The resulting river boat traffic was of great economic importance until the 16th and 17th centuries. After a short siege the town was captured by Bern on 14 April 1415. In 1416, the castle became the residence of the bailiff of the Bailiwick of Aarburg. Under control of Bern, the castle was expanded into a fortress in the 16th and 17th centuries, in order to protect the alliance between the Reformed cities of Bern and Zurich from attack by their Catholic neighbors. On 4 May 1798 the town and fortress were captured by France without a struggle. The district of Aarburg was dissolved and the regional administrative functions of the French imposed Helvetic Republic were moved to Zofingen. The newly established Canton of Aargau took over the fortress in 1804, initially using it as a jail and prison. Since 1893 the castle has housed a canton-run school. A huge fire destroyed much of the premises and the church on 4 May 1840, leaving 68 families homeless. The village was rebuilt, though without the main fortifications. On the rock spur, near the castle, a church was raised up between 1842 and 1845 in the new gothic style. The first textile factory was opened in 1824. The railway station was opened in on 9 July 1856 along the Aarau ‚Äì Olten ‚Äì Zofingen ‚Äì Emmenbr√ºcke line; on 16 March 1857, the Herzogenbuchsee line was opened, later extended to Bern. Aarburg thereby became a privileged industrial town. In the second half of the 20th century the township's population doubled due to the construction of the autobahn nearby.

The houses are grouped around a similarly wedge-shaped square. The town fortification on the north side was never rebuilt after the fire of 1840. Dominating the old town is a narrow, extended rock spur, on which one finds the Aarburg fortress. It was constructed at the beginning of the 12th century and expanded into a mighty fortress when it was controlled by Bern. The fortress complex is a nationally recognized cultural asset and serves as a youth center today. The fortress offers public tours at 2:00 PM on Saturdays during the spring and summer months (around April‚ÄìOctober). A tour fee is charged (2010:10.CHF) for persons 16 and over. Private tours may be arranged by reservation all year through the youth center (Jugendheim Aarburg). The Aarburg Historic Museum is open the 2nd and 4th Sunday mornings of the month. On a terrace between the fortress and the old town one finds the reformed church. It was constructed from 1842 to 1845 in the new gothic style with two spires located on the west side. Beneath the church on the rock spur is the parsonage, constructed in 1726; until the town fire of 1840 the town gate went through its basement.

It originates from Namby Pamby (1725) by Henry Carey. Carey wrote his poem as a satire of Ambrose Philips and published it in his Poems on Several Occasions. Its first publication was Namby Pamby: or, a panegyrick on the new versification address'd to A----- P----, where the A-- P-- implicated Ambrose Philips. Philips had written a series of odes in a new prosody of seven- syllable lines and dedicated it to \\"all ages and characters, from Walpole steerer of the realm, to Miss Pulteney in the nursery.\\" This 3.5' line became a matter of consternation for more conservative poets, and a matter of mirth for Carey. Carey adopts Philips's choppy line-form for his parody and latches onto the dedication to nurseries to create an apparent nursery rhyme that is, in fact, a grand bit of nonsense and satire mixed. Philips was a figure who had become politically active and was a darling of the Whig party. He was also a target of the Tory satirists. Alexander Pope had criticized Philips repeatedly (in The Guardian and in his Peri Bathos, among other places), and praising or condemning Philips was a political as much as poetic matter in the 1720s, with the nickname also employed by John Gay and Jonathan Swift. The poem begins with a mock-epic opening (as had Pope's Rape of the Lock and as had Dryden's MacFlecknoe), calling all the muses to witness the glory of Philips's prosodic reform: :\\"All ye Poets of the Age! :All ye Witlings of the Stage! :Learn your Jingles to reform! :Crop your Numbers and Conform: :Let your little Verses flow :Gently, Sweetly, Row by Row: :Let the Verse the Subject fit; :Little Subject, Little Wit. :Namby-Pamby is your Guide; :Albion's Joy, Hibernia's Pride.\\" Carey's Namby Pamby had enormous success. It became so successful that people began to call Philips himself \\"Namby Pamby\\" (as, for example, in The Dunciad in 1727), as he had been renamed by the poem, and Carey was referred to as \\"Namby Pamby Carey\\".

Grigson's one surviving brother, Wilfrid Grigson, was killed in an air crash in 1948, on mission as Commissioner for Refugees in Pakistan. Geoffrey Grigson's first wife was Frances Franklin Galt (who died in 1937 of tuberculosis). With her, he founded the poetry magazine New Verse. They had one daughter, Caroline (who was married to designer Colin Banks). With his second wife, Berta Emma Kunert, Grigson had two children, Anna and Lionel Grigson. Following divorce from his second wife, Grigson married Jane Grigson, n√©e McIntire (1928‚Äì90). Their daughter is Sophie Grigson. Among Grigson's grandchildren is the political scientist Giacomo Benedetto.

Data organization involves characters, fields, records, files and so on. This concept is a starting point when trying to see what makes up data and whether data has a structure. For example, how does a person make sense of data such as 'employee', 'name', 'department', 'Marcy Smith', 'Sales Department' and so on, assuming that they are all related? One way to understand them is to see these terms as smaller or larger components in a hierarchy. One might say that Marcy Smith is one of the employees in the Sales Department, or an example of an employee in that Department. The data we want to capture about all our employees, and not just Marcy, is the name, ID number, address etc.  Purpose of the Data Hierarchy  \\"Data hierarchy\\" is a basic concept in data and database theory and helps to show the relationships between smaller and larger components in a database or data file. It is used to give a better sense of understanding about the components of data and how they are related.  Components of the Data Hierarchy  The components of the data hierarchy are listed below. A data field holds a single fact or attribute of an entity. Consider a date field, e.g. \\"19 September 2004\\". This can be treated as a single date field (e.g. birthdate), or three fields, namely, day of month, month and year. A record is a collection of related fields. An Employee record may contain a name field(s), address fields, birthdate field and so on. A file is a collection of related records. If there are 100 employees, then each employee would have a record (e.g. called Employee Personal Details record) and the collection of 100 such records would constitute a file (in this case, called Employee Personal Details file). Files are integrated into a database. This is done using a Database Management System. If there are other facets of employee data that we wish to capture, then other files such as Employee Training History file and Employee Work History file could be created as well.  Illustration of the data hierarchy  An illustration of the above description is shown in this diagram below. Data Hierarchy diagram The following terms are for better clarity. With reference to the example in the above diagram. Data field label = Employee Name or EMP_NAME Data field value = Jeffrey Tan The above description is a view of data as understood by a user e.g. a person working in Human Resource Department. The above structure can be seen in the hierarchical model, which is one way to organize data in a database. In terms of data storage, data fields are made of bytes and these in turn are made up of bits.

An administrative division (sous-pr√©fecture) of the Bas-Rhin department, the town lies on the Ill river, from the Rhine and the German border. S√©lestat is located between the largest communes of Alsace, Strasbourg and Mulhouse. In 2013, S√©lestat had a total population of 19,332, which makes it the eighth most populous town in Alsace. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance it was the third largest city in the region, after Strasbourg and Colmar, and it is ranked the third commune in Alsace for cultural heritage. S√©lestat was founded in the 8th century as a port on the Ill and it experienced a long period of prosperity thanks to the trade in wine and a thriving religious and cultural life. It gradually declined after the Reformation and the French conquest in the 17th century. The town eventually experienced a new demographic growth in the second half of the 20th century when it became a small industrial and cultural centre. Thanks to its rich heritage, which includes the renowned Humanist Library and an imposing pair of medieval churches, S√©lestat is an important tourist destination in Alsace. It also benefits from its location on the Alsace wine road and its proximity to Haut-K≈ìnigsbourg castle. Aside from the medieval old town, the commune of S√©lestat encompasses a nature reserve including one of the largest riparian forests of France.  Name  Bilingual French-Alsatian road-sign at the entrance of S√©lestat. The present name of the town is a Frenchification of the original Germanic name. It appeared soon after the French conquest in the 17th century.. The town is called Schlettst√†dt () in Alsatian and () in German. S√©lestat was first mentioned in 727 as Sclastat.. It was mentioned as Scalistati in 775, as Slectistat in 881, as Sclezistat in 884 and as Slezestat in 1095. The current German name, Schlettstadt, appeared in 1310, although various spellings can be noticed on posterior documents, such as Schlestat, Schletstat and Schlettstat. The French administration used various forms from the 17th to the 19th century, such as Frenchified (S√©lestat, S√©lestadt) and Germanic (Schlestadt, Schelestadt). The town was officially known as Schlettstadt between 1871 and 1919, when Alsace was part of the German Empire. Since 1920, the town's French name is fixed as S√©lestat. The origin of the name \\"Schlettstadt\\" is unclear. It probably derives from Germanic words slade or sclade meaning \\"marshes\\", and stat for \\"city\\". S√©lestat would then be a \\"city in the marshes\\", a reference to its position in the Grand Ried, a vast area subject to flooding that stretches over the centre of Alsace. Stat could also mean \\"area\\" rather than \\"city\\". A popular myth explains that the town takes its name from a dragon called Schletto that founded the settlement after opening up the nearby Li√®pvre valley in the Vosges mountains.  History  = Birth of the town = An 18th-century relief on a house in the old town. It recalls the origins of S√©lestat: the three mermaids symbolise the Ill river and its tributaries Li√®pvrette and Giessen, the tree and reed stand for the Illwald forest and marshes, and the boat evokes the wine trade. S√©lestat was first mentioned in 727 AD but the town probably has an earlier Celtic or Roman origin.. Archaeological findings provide evidence of human settlement during the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. A large number of wood piles dating from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were discovered around St. Quirin chapel, suggesting a Roman settlement. At that time S√©lestat might have already been a port on the river Ill.. When S√©lestat started to appear in written documents in the 8th century, it may have been a market town or simply a village populated by fishermen and farmers. The area was part of the estate of Eberhard, a member of the Alsatian ducal family, who donated it to Murbach Abbey at the end of his life. In 775, Charlemagne spent Christmas in S√©lestat, which indicates that the town must have had enough appropriate buildings and population to accommodate his court and troops. In the 1080s, S√©lestat was the property of Hildegard von Eguisheim, mother of Frederick I, Duke of Swabia, the first member of the House of Hohenstaufen. Hildegard transformed the place into a religious centre when she founded St. Faith's Church, which she gave to the Benedictines of Conques Abbey. Monks from Conques opened a priory next to the church in 1092. The House of Hohenstaufen quickly became the leading dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire, which came to the imperial throne in 1152. Being under their protection, the priory of S√©lestat strongly influenced local life. Even though S√©lestat constituted a distinct parish, its priest had only limited power and the Benedictine prior was the true head of the municipality. At the end of the 12th century, the Hohenstaufen dynasty gradually lost power and as a result the priory started to decline. The citizens used this opportunity to reduce the prior's dominance. and secure the power of their parish. They started to build a new parish church in the 1220s. St. George's Church was designed in Gothic style and was significantly larger than St. Faith's Church, another way to signify the end of Benedictine hegemony.. = Free imperial city = Engraving from Wapen des Heyligen R√∂mischen Reichs Teutscher Nation (1545) with the coat of arms of S√©lestat (at that time an eagle instead of a lion). Frederick II, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire in the 13th century, realised that his dynasty was losing its power and granted freedoms to many cities in order to keep their allegiance. These cities became Free imperial cities and S√©lestat became one of them in 1217. Under the new status S√©lestat was able to build city walls and collect taxes on its own. Its serfs and settlers were freed. The German monarch Adolf of Nassau granted S√©lestat a constitution in 1292. It was amended many times but it regulated local politics until 1789. Although the new status favoured trade and prosperity, free cities in Alsace were afraid that they would not be defended by imperial forces if a conflict was to occur. So they decided to form an alliance called the Decapolis in 1354, which comprised ten cities: (Haguenau, Colmar, Wissembourg, Turckheim, Obernai, Kaysersberg, Rosheim, Munster, S√©lestat and Mulhouse). The seat of the alliance was in Haguenau but its archives were kept in S√©lestat. Because the town was the most centrally located, it often hosted meetings of the association.. The Benedictine priory was closed in 1424 after many years of decline. It had long lost its power to the local nobility that were gradually replaced by the bourgeoisie in the mid-14th century. Nevertheless, S√©lestat remained a religious centre even after the closing of the priory. Convents were established in the 13th century by Dominicans, Knights Hospitaller and Franciscans. Several abbeys located outside of the town also had a residence in town. At the beginning of the 16th century, S√©lestat was a noted centre of Renaissance humanism thanks to its celebrated Latin school. Reformers Beatus Rhenanus and Martin Bucer were among the school's alumni. This school helped spread Protestant ideas among the population, although the local authorities remained faithful to Rome. Erasmus of Rotterdam visited S√©lestat four times between 1515 and 1522.. Being a free city, S√©lestat attracted settlers from the region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had become too constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At the end of the Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each).. The local economy reached its zenith around 1500.. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). As the road network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river. = Decline = \\"Are illustrious times gone?\\", early 17th-century engraving symbolising S√©lestat with broken Tables of the Law and columns in the foreground. The decline of the town started in the 1520s, when the humanist school lost its former influence. The troubles surrounding the Protestant Reformation brought instability and unrest to the region. The town experienced the German Peasants' War in 1525 and its convents were sacked by a mob in 1534.. During the same period S√©lestat lost its pre-eminence in the Decapolis because the city of Mulhouse left the alliance in 1515 and was replaced by Landau in 1521, moving the geographical centre of the alliance to the north.. During the 17th century, Alsace was one of the main battlefields of the Thirty Years War. S√©lestat was seized by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They surrendered the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly faithful to the House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France.. S√©lestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674.. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis. At first, S√©lestat was a major strategic stronghold for the French. Located near the Rhine, it controlled the access to the Vosges mountains and the rest of France. Vauban, the foremost military architect at that time, rebuilt the town walls between 1675 and 1691. However, after the conquest of Strasbourg in 1681 S√©lestat lost much of its strategic importance, as Strasbourg was better located. But it remained a garrison town, and the troops stationed there helped to improve the faltering local economy. Although Protestantism was not forbidden in Alsace, French authorities largely encouraged Catholicism and opened three new convents in S√©lestat.. Jews were expelled from the town in 1642.. During the French Revolution the population was extremely conservative and opposed to change.. The new territorial organisation confirmed the decline of the town, which did not become a prefecture and was not distinguished as a subprefecture until 1806, when it replaced Barr in that capacity.. S√©lestat suffered from the Napoleonic wars as it was besieged and bombed by the Bavarians in 1814 and blockaded by a German coalition in 1815.. = Since 1815 = The train station in 1842, soon after its opening. Industry appeared very early in S√©lestat. The town had already several factories at the beginning of the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. S√©lestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence.. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.. S√©lestat became French again after the First World War, during which almost a thousand inhabitants died. It was part of the Third Reich during the Second World War. Its liberation took three months and ended in February 1945. The town is a recipient of the War Cross 1914‚Äì1918 and War Cross 1939‚Äì1945.. S√©lestat has experienced steady demographic and economic growth since 1945. Its population almost doubled between 1946 and 1999 and two industrial parks were built to accommodate new large factories. The service industry has enriched the town's economy since the 1970s with a large number of small businesses.. South of the town, at , a large broadcasting facility was used for transmitting on 1161 kHz and 1278 kHz in the medium-wave range. It was opened in 1948 and ceased to emit on 1 January 2016.  Governance  The town hall. S√©lestat is one of the six subprefectures of the Bas-Rhin departement. As such it is at the head of the S√©lestat-Erstein arrondissement. S√©lestat is also the administrative centre of a canton including 28 other communes which primarily serve as a constituency for local elections.. S√©lestat is part of the 5th Bas-Rhin constituency for national elections. Since 2002, the Member of the National Assembly for the constituency has been the Republican Antoine Herth.. S√©lestat is a member of a federation of communes with shared competencies: the Communaut√© de communes de S√©lestat. S√©lestat is its main town, and it includes 11 neighbouring villages. It was created in 1995 to replace an older but similar structure founded in 1969.. S√©lestat is also the seat of the Central Alsace pays, a structure aiming at developing the area.. The town has had a council since 1292, when it was granted a constitution under the Holy Roman Empire. The constitution shaped the local political system until the French Revolution of 1789. Since then, the town has been administered as all the other communes of France. Its council currently comprises 33 councillors, whose number is defined by law according to the size of the population. The town also has a mayor elected by the councillors.Art L. 2121-2 du code g√©n√©ral des collectivit√©s territoriales. Alsace in general is a stronghold of the French right. The main French right- wing party, The Republicans, currently holds a large majority in the council (26 councillors). Marcel Bauer, who has been mayor since 2001, is also a member of that party. Voters in S√©lestat generally favour right-wing candidates at other elections as well, although S√©lestat was governed by the Socialist Party between 1989 and 2001.  Geography  S√©lestat and its bell towers with the Vosges mountains in the background. S√©lestat is located at the very centre of Alsace, near the limit separating the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin departments, which traditionally correspond to Lower and Upper Alsace, respectively. The town is located between Strasbourg and Mulhouse, the first being north and the latter south of the city. S√©lestat is also located between Obernai () and Colmar (). On the other side of the Rhine, Freiburg im Breisgau is around distant.. S√©lestat lies on the Alsace plains, a narrow, very fertile area that stretches between the Rhine and the Vosges mountains. The Ill flows parallel to the Rhine and crosses S√©lestat. This river frequently branches and swells, making the area very wet and subject to flooding. S√©lestat is only from the Vosges,. at the opening of one of the rare valleys crossing the mountain range and providing a connection to the rest of France.. This valley corresponds to the course of the Giessen, a long tributary of the Ill. In contrast to the Ill, which has a constant annual flow, the Giessen is a mountain river subject to sudden increases in the water level, especially during the spring thaw period. The Giessen passes north of the town and meets the Ill several kilometers to the east, in Ebersmunster.. The town itself is built on the Giessen alluvial fan so it is slightly higher than the rest of the Alsace plains. Much of its territory is however located on areas liable to flooding. Such areas are mostly located inside the Illwald natural reserve and comprise both forests and meadows. There the Ill forms more than of waterways..

File:Giessen, S√©lestat.JPG|The Giessen.  Transport  S√©lestat train station. A TIS bus in S√©lestat. Despite its small size, S√©lestat is well connected to transport networks. Alsace as a whole, being part of the economic heart of Europe, has a high road and railway density. The town is served by the A35 autoroute, a motorway that crosses Alsace north to south, connecting Strasbourg, Colmar and Mulhouse. Further south it connects to the Swiss A3 motorway, and further north to the German B9 highway. Taken together, these three roads connect the Netherlands to Austria. S√©lestat is also located at one of the seven crossings of the Vosges mountains, connecting Lorraine to Alsace and Germany. S√©lestat train station was opened in 1840, which makes it one of the oldest in France. It lies on the Strasbourg‚ÄìBasel railway, which also serves Colmar, Mulhouse and Saint-Louis.. S√©lestat is at the terminus of two local railways that are partly closed: S√©lestat-Lesseux, now ending in Li√®pvre, and S√©lestat-Saverne, now ending in Molsheim. The former railway runs towards the west through the Vosges, while the latter runs towards the northwest. A third local line, S√©lestat-Sundhouse, closed in 1953.. Although one of the oldest in France, the Strasbourg-Basel railway allows high speed travel of () because it is very rectilinear and crosses a very flat landscape. S√©lestat is served by all regional trains between Strasbourg and Basel (one train in each direction every hour on weekdays).. Local trains also run between S√©lestat and Molsheim, S√©lestat and Strasbourg and S√©lestat and Barr... S√©lestat is served by a Paris-Colmar TGV every day in each direction, by Strasbourg-Nice and Strasbourg-Cerb√®re Intercit√©s in the summer, and by EuroCity trains connecting Zurich to Brussels and Basel to Luxembourg City. SNCF and the Bas-Rhin council operate coach lines between S√©lestat and Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines, Saint-Di√©- des-Vosges, Ribeauvill√©, Marckolsheim, Sundhouse and Vill√©. The council also arranges for seasonal connections with Haut-K≈ìnigsbourg castle and Europa Park... S√©lestat and its communaut√© de communes have their own local bus network, the \\"Transport intercommunal de S√©lestat\\" (TIS). It comprises two lines, one connecting Ch√¢tenois to Ebersheim, and the other Scherwiller to Muttersholtz. These two lines make several stops in S√©lestat proper, which is at the centre of the network..  Demography  , S√©lestat had 19,252 inhabitants.T√©l√©chargement du fichier d'ensemble des populations l√©gales en 2017, INSEE It is the 8th most populated commune in Alsace, having reached its maximum population in 2006, with 19,459 inhabitants. The oldest preserved birth registries of the town's Catholic parish go back to the year 1608; the oldest vital records (√©tat civil) go back to the year 1793. S√©lestat was one of the largest towns in the region from the Middle Ages until the beginning of the 19th century. In 1801, it was still the third most populous in Alsace behind Strasbourg and Colmar. It then had 7,375 inhabitants, a slightly higher figure than for Mulhouse (7,197) and Haguenau (7,009). Through the 19th century, S√©lestat did not take advantage of industrialisation and rural exodus because its city wall and military function prevented urban growth. It reached its overpopulation threshold around 1830, with around 10,000 inhabitants living on only .. Only after the Second World War did S√©lestat experience significant demographic growth, almost doubling its population in 50 years. However, this growth was not strong enough for S√©lestat to recover its previous rank. The demographic growth that occurred in S√©lestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‚Ä∞ in S√©lestat over the period 1968‚Äì1975, compared to 16.9‚Ä∞ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990Dossier complet, Commune de S√©lestat (67462), INSEE because S√©lestat and Central Alsace were on the margins of the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach S√©lestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers. The population of S√©lestat is relatively young, 36.2% of the population were under 30 in 2017 (France: 35.7%) and the percentage of people over 60 years old (23.6%) was lower than the national (25.5%) figure. S√©lestat has a significant proportion of people between 15 and 44 (39.7%, compared to 36.4% for all of France) because it attracts a large number of young actives and couples starting a family. As other towns in the region, such as Saverne, Haguenau and Molsheim, it welcomes young adults and encourages them to settle in the surrounding villages..  Economy  Small shops in the old town. At the end of 2015, S√©lestat had 2,142 businesses, most of them (1,441) in the tertiary sector. A large share were small businesses; only 9% had more than 10 employees. S√©lestat is a retail and services centre for the whole Central Alsace, with a large shopping park and administrative and educational institutions.. Industry is nonetheless represented by some large firms, such as the Soci√©t√© alsacienne de meubles, which builds kitchens and bathrooms under a Schmidt and Cuisinella franchise, Amcor (aluminium packaging), Daramic (battery separators), Albany (gauzes for the printing industry), Wanzl (warehouse material), and DHJ (textiles).. Most of the large factories are in an industrial estate located south of the town centre. Created in the 1930s, it covers a site of ... The newer commercial estate north of the town was developed in the 1970s and is dedicated to retail and cottage industry. It covers .. The town centre is also an important shopping area with more than 200 businesses..  Sights and culture  In terms of architecture the city is one of the richest and most varied among the smaller cities of Alsace. Although it is only the 8th most populous town in the region, it has the third largest cultural heritage after Strasbourg and Colmar.. S√©lestat has 35 listed buildings. and 119 additional sites that are indexed in the French list of cultural heritage monuments.. = Museums = The Humanist Library of S√©lestat. The Humanist Library displays one of the oldest and most homogeneous collections of medieval manuscripts and Renaissance books in Europe. Its core is the still almost intact library of Beatus Rhenanus, which was bequeathed to the city and has been maintained by it ever since. The institution also holds the books that belonged to the Latin school of S√©lestat, at which Rhenanus and many other reformers were educated around 1500. In 2011, the library has been inscribed in the Unesco's Memory of the World Register. The library is open to both researchers and tourists, with an exhibition displaying some of its most noteworthy items: an 8th-century lectionary, the first books printed in Alsace, a copy of the Cosmographiae Introductio where the oldest mention of America can be found, and a 1521 document which contains the oldest record of a Christmas tree.. S√©lestat also has a museum dedicated to bread and baking. and it is the seat of the FRAC d'Alsace, a regional institution whose aim is to collect contemporary works of art (see below, Cultural institutions and events). These works are regularly part of temporary exhibits in S√©lestat and other places in Alsace. FRAC possesses works by Aur√©lie Nemours, Olivier Debr√©, Mario Merz and Panamarenko, among other artists.. = Religious architecture = St Faith's Church. S√©lestat has two large and remarkable churches from the Middle Ages. St. Faith's Church is the oldest and a prime example of Romanesque architecture. Its design is related to similar buildings both in the Rhine region and in Lorraine. It was built during the second half of the 12th century to replace an earlier building.. The church was renovated in the 19th century and a medieval death mask was found during this work. It is often attributed to Hildegard of Eguisheim, founder of the church, and is now displayed in a crypt.. St. George's Church has always served as the main parish church. It is often referred to as \\"the cathedral\\" because of its size, but it has never been the seat of a diocese. Its construction started soon after 1200 and was completed at the beginning of the 15th century. Its design is pure Gothic, save for a Romanesque side portal. The choir, the last part to be completed, is the most remarkable element. It is illuminated by 288 stained glass panels, of which 55 date from the 15th century.. Most of the convents of the town have disappeared; the Dominican convent is the only one to have retained much of its original appearance. It was built in the 13th century and still has its church and cloister... The Franciscan convent was completely destroyed, apart from the choir of its church, which now serves as a Protestant church.. S√©lestat also has an old granary that belonged to the Benedictine priory, and a 16th-century commandery built by the Knights Hospitaller.. The synagogue was built in 1890. Its architecture is typical of the region, with a square shape and discreet neo-romanesque ornaments. Its cupola was destroyed in 1940 by the Nazis and never rebuilt. The Jewish cemetery, located outside the old town, was opened in 1622. It has several 18th century gravestones showing a Christian artistic influence..

The old town comprises a large number of medieval and Renaissance buildings. The quai des Tanneurs (\\"tanners' quay\\") is one of the most picturesque streets in Alsace. A stream used to flow in the middle of the street until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious- smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of flowing water for treating and washing animal skins. Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a ventilated space for drying leather.. In the neighbouring streets, rue des Oies (\\"geese street\\") and rue des Veaux (\\"calf street\\"), many houses were covered with a coat of plaster in the 19th century in order to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic. Several h√¥tels particuliers (large townhouses) date from the Renaissance. Most of them have oriel windows that are characteristic of German Renaissance architecture. The grandest of these h√¥tels belonged to the Ebersmunster abbey and it has a large three-story granary. The Ziegler house has a beautiful oriel that shows the interest of the elite of that time in Antiquity. The oriel partly reflects Vitruvius's architectural legacy and displays the portraits of four key figures of Antiquity. Baroque architecture is visible on some later h√¥tels dating from the 17th and 18th century. French classical architecture and its main feature, the mansard roof, were largely employed in the 18th century. To reduce costs, buildings were still built with timber framing, but as this technique was considered too Germanic and rustic, they were often covered with a rendering imitating stone.. Quai des Tanneurs. The German period (1871‚Äì1918) left some examples of Wilhelminism in the city's architecture. This prestige-oriented style is a mixture of various earlier styles, including Romanesque, Gothic and neoclassical. Noteworthy are the post office (1884),. the courthouse (1900),. the lyc√©e Koeberl√© (1913). and the water tower (1906). The latter (height: ) was largely inspired by the water tower in Deventer, Netherlands. The medieval city walls, built in several stages between the 13th and the 16th century, were torn down after the French annexation in the 17th century. However, four towers escaped destruction. The Tour des Sorci√®res (\\"witches' tower\\"), which served as a gate and a jail, is the tallest.. The Tour de l'Horloge (\\"clock tower\\") was also originally part of a gate. The clock and the elaborate roof were added in 1614.. Two much smaller towers can also be seen, one near the Ill river and another integrated into a later house. All these remains date from the 13th century.. New walls were built by Tarade and Vauban in the 17th century. They were in their turn destroyed in 1874. Only small portions survive: two bastions and the Porte de Strasbourg (\\"Strasbourg gate\\"), a good example of French architecture under Louis XIV.. S√©lestat still has two old arsenals, Sainte-Barbe on the main square (1470) and Saint-Hilaire (1518).. The first, with a large crenelated gable, is a fine example of Gothic architecture.

The Illwald forest was designated a regional nature reserve in 2013. It covers , almost half of the territory of S√©lestat, and is one of the largest riparian forests in France. It lies on the Ill, which forms a complex hydrographic network there. The site is subject to flooding and it is characteristic of the Grand Ried, a flat region located between the Ill and the Rhine that serves as a natural spillway for the two rivers. Common trees are oaks, willows and alders, which tolerate wet soils. Because the phreatic table is very close to the surface, soils hardly freeze in winter and drought rarely occurs in summer. The nature reserve also has meadows and reed beds. Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve is home to the largest fallow deer population in France. This animal was introduced to the area in 1854. The Illwald contains three chapels that were originally pilgrimage destinations. The Schnellenbuhl chapel was built by Jesuits in 1683; Our Lady of the Oaks dates back to the 15th century but it was rebuilt after a fire in 1920; Our Lady of Peace was built in 1960, and St. Anthony was founded in 1280 but rebuilt in 1930.. = Other cultural institutions and events = The \\"corso fleuri\\". S√©lestat is the seat of the Agence culturelle d'Alsace (\\"cultural agency of Alsace\\", ACA) since 1976. Since 1982, S√©lestat is the seat of the FRAC Alsace, the Alsace branch of the Fonds r√©gional d'art contemporain (\\"Regional Contemporary art fund\\"), administered by the ACA. A biennale dedicated to contemporary art takes place every two year in autumn since 1984. It has welcomed artists like Daniel Buren, Ben Vautier, Sarkis Zabunyan and Agn√®s Varda.. Since 2006, S√©lestat is the seat of Arch√©ologie Alsace (formerly known as the P√¥le interd√©partemental d'arch√©ologie rh√©nan, the \\"Rhenish inter- d√©partemental center for archaeology\\"), which conducts and documents archaeological field surveys and excavations in Alsace. Every year since 1927, S√©lestat has organised a large flower procession through its old town. The \\"corso fleuri\\" is one of the biggest floral shows in eastern France. New floats are made each year around a theme and decorated with dahlias only.. A carnaval procession is also held in March. It is the remnant of a very old tradition started by the town's butchers.. S√©lestat also has festivals dedicated to electronic music (Epidemic Experience), satirical cartoons (S√©lest'ival), a spring fun fair, and a summer medieval reenactment with a market and a procession.. The cultural complex Les Tanzmatten, built by Rudy Ricciotti, was inaugurated in 2000. It serves as the town's concert and performances hall, as well as for exhibitions, commercial fairs and weddings.  Sports  S√©lestat Alsace Handball is a noted French handball club.

Biography Liliencron was the son of Louis (Ludwig) Freiherr von Liliencron and Adeline von Harten. He entered the Prussian army and took part in the campaigns of 1866 and 1870‚Äì71 (Franco- Prussian War), in both of which he was wounded. In 1875, he retired with the rank of captain and spent some time in America (1875 to 1877), afterwards settling at Kellinghusen in Holstein, where he remained until 1887. After some time at Munich, he settled in Altona and later at Alt-Rahlstedt, now a part of Hamburg. Assessment Liliencron was one of the most eminent of German lyric poets of his time; his Adjutantenritte, with its fresh original style, broke with the well-worn literary conventions then prevalent which had been handed down from the middle of the century. Rainer Maria Rilke, among others, was heavily influenced by Liliencron's poems. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Liliencron's work is somewhat uneven, since he lacked the sustained power which makes a prose writer successful. Music His poems were set to music, such as \\"Auf dem Kirchhofe\\" by Johannes Brahms as No. 4 of his F√ºnf Lieder, Op. 105. Works He first attracted attention by the volume of poems, Adjutantenritte und andere Gedichte (1883), which was followed by several unsuccessful dramas, a volume of short stories, Eine Sommerschlacht (1886), and a novel Breide Hummelsb√ºttel (1887). Other collections of short stories appeared under the titles Unter flatternden Fahnen (1888). Der M√§cen (1889), Krieg und Frieden (1891); of lyric poetry in 1889, 1890 (Der Heideg√§nger und andere Gedichte), 1893, and 1903 (Bunte Beute). Interesting, too, is the humorous epic Poggfred (1896; 2nd ed. 1904). Liliencron's complete works were published in 14 volumes (1904‚Äì1905); his Gedichte having been previously collected in four volumes under the titles Kampf und Spiele, K√§mpfe und Ziele, \\"Nebel und Sonne and Bunte Beute (1897‚Äì1903).

Early years and career George Darley was born in Dublin, to Arthur Darley and his wife Mary. The Darleys were an important Dublin family of their time, and related to the Guinnesses by marriage, Arthur's sister Mary having married Richard Guinness, whose uncle Arthur Guinness founded the Guinness brewing company.Mary Guinness (Darley) at Geni.com The Darleys also had a country house called Springfield in south County Dublin, near Enniskerry in County Wicklow, where George spent his early years.The Irish Monthly, Volume 36 p. 231Pearson, Peter (1998). Between the Mountains and the Sea. Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County. p. 310, Dublin: O'Brien Press, George was awarded a BA in mathematics and classics from Trinity College Dublin in 1820. Having decided to follow a literary career, in 1821 he moved to London. He wrote poetry and plays in an attempt to break into literary circles, but had more luck getting published as a critic. During this period he supported himself by writing several mathematical texts for a series published by John Taylor (London) called Darley's Scientific Library. In later life, he fell into depression and died on 23 November 1846 in London. Playwright Dion Boucicault was a nephew. His grandnephew was the Irish musician and music collector Arthur Warren Darley. Works Darley published his first poem, Errors of Ecstasie, in 1822. He also wrote for the London Magazine, under the pseudonym of John Lacy. In it appeared his story Lilian of the Vale, later reprinted in his short-story collection The Labours of Idleness, or, Seven Nights' Experiments (1826), published under the pseudonym \\"Guy Penseval.\\" Various other books followed, including Sylvia, or The May Queen, a poem (1827). Thereafter Darley joined the Athenaeum, in which he became a severe critic. He was also a dramatist and studied old English plays, editing those of Beaumont and Fletcher in 1840. His poem \\"It is not beauty I desire\\" was included by F. T. Palgrave in the first edition of his Golden Treasury as an anonymous lyric of the 17th century. Darley wrote a number of songs such as \\"I've been Roaming\\", once popular, and praised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He was also a mathematician, and published some treatises on the subject. His works included: *Nepenthe *Sylvia; or, The May Queen *The Mermaidens' Vesper-Hymn *The Sea-Bride *Thomas √† Beckett: A Dramatic Chronicle in Five Acts *A System of Popular Algebra (John Taylor, London, 1826?). *A System of Popular Geometry (John Taylor, London, 1826). *A System of Popular Trigonometry (John Taylor, London, 1827). *The Geometrical Companion (John Taylor, London, 1828). *Familiar Astronomy (John Taylor, London, 1830). Reputation A. E. Housman said of a passage from his poem Nepenthe, \\"Admirers of the sea may call that a lampoon or a caricature, but they cannot deny that it is life-like: the man who wrote it had seen the sea, and the man who reads it sees the sea again\\". Darley was a friend of such literary luminaries as Charles Lamb, Thomas Carlyle, John Clare, and other writers such as Allan Cunningham and Monckton Milnes.\\"Oxford Companion to English Literature\\", ed.

Biography Although alleged to be of Norwich, Thomas Deloney was most likely born in London where he was trained as a silk-weaver.Assertions that Deloney was probably born in Norwich are all based on a failure to double- check sources. F. O. Mann misquoted Thomas Nashe as referring to Deloney as \\"the balletiting silk-weaver of Norwich.\\" The phrase \\"of Norwich\\" is Mann's invention, one that has somehow eluded scholars. See Hyder E. Rollins, \\"Notes on Thomas Deloney,\\" Modern Language Notes 32.2 (1917): 121-23. On the possibility that Deloney was of immigrant heritage, see Scott Oldenburg, Alien Albion: Literature and Immigration in Early Modern England (U. of Toronto Press, 2014), 75-98.

Readers are, however, encouraged to consult Hyder E. Rollins, \\"Notes on Thomas Deloney,,\\" Modern Language Notes 32 (1917), 121-23. This long ignored article draws attention to the lack of actual evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, for Norwich as Deloney's birthplace. In the course of the next ten years he is known to have written about fifty ballads, one-sheet stories and news sheets, some of which got him into trouble, and caused him to keep a low profile for a time. John Strype described him as \\"presumptuous\\", because the heroes and heroines of his works were clearly common people, and therefore in Strype's terms only suitable for comedy or farce.Rollison, David A Commonwealth of the People: Popular Politics and England's Long Social Revolution, 1066-1649, Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 330 His more important work as a novelist, in which he ranks with Robert Greene and Thomas Nashe, was not noted until much later. He appears to have turned to this genre to try to keep out of trouble. According to A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature, 'Less under the influence of John Lyly and other preceding writers than Greene, he is more natural, simple, and direct, and writes of middle-class citizens and tradesmen with light humour.

There is evidence to suggest that his son traveled to the Virginia colony. The lavish diversity of his characters, has led to him being viewed as a precursor of Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, and Charles Dickens. The critic Merritt E.

He served as Surveyor of the King's Works and is buried in Westminster Abbey.'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p12: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966 Early life Denham was born in Dublin to Sir John Denham, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and his second wife Eleanor Moore, daughter of Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore and his wife Mary Colley. His father was a native of London; the family later settled at Egham in Surrey. He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford and at Lincoln's Inn in London. He was an indifferent student, and was notorious for heavy gambling, which was a source of much worry to his father. He married firstly in 1634 Ann Cotton, by whom he had three children, a son who died young and two daughters who reached adulthood. He married secondly in 1665 Margaret Brooke (1642-1667), daughter of Sir William Brooke and his second wife Penelope Hill. His unhappy second marriage was the cause of much gossip, and Margaret's sudden death in 1667 gave rise to rumours that he had poisoned her. Civil War In his earlier years Denham suffered for his Royalism; during the English Civil War, he was appointed High Sheriff of Surrey (for 1642) and governor of Farnham Castle. Farnham quickly fell to the Parliamentary forces and Denham was sent a prisoner to London, but was soon released. He spent the next five years in Oxford, where he enjoyed the trust and confidence of Charles I. During the abortive peace negotiations of 1646, Parliament listed him as one of those who must be excluded from the King's counsels. In 1648 he joined the Court in exile, and spent the next four years abroad. He returned to England in 1652 to find that his lands had been sold; for a time he was almost penniless, until he acquired the protection of Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke. The authorities, worried by his frequent visits to London, ordered him to choose a residence more than twenty miles from the capital, which he was not to leave. He settled at Bury St. Edmunds. John Aubrey recorded a story of this period which reflects well on Denham's wit and generosity of spirit: > ‚ÄúIn the time of the civill warres, George Withers, the poet, begged Sir John > Denham's estate at Egham of the Parliament, in whose cause he was a captaine > of horse. It happened that G. W. was taken prisoner, and was in danger of > his life, having written severely against the king, &c.; Sir John Denham > went to the king, and desired his majestie not to hang him, for that whilest > G. W. lived he should not be the worst poet in England.‚ÄùJohn Aubrey, Brief > Lives (ed. Andrew Clark), Volume I (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1898), at page > 221 After 1660 Denham became a Member of Parliament for Old Sarum in 1661, became a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 May 1663, and became a Knight of the Bath. He received substantial grants of land in compensation for his forfeited estates. He built or commissioned the original Burlington House in Piccadilly in about 1665. After the Restoration Denham became Surveyor of the King's Works, probably due to his earlier political services rather than for any aptitude as an architect. John Webb, who, as Inigo Jones's deputy undoubtedly had the competence to have served in the post, complained that \\"though Mr. Denham may, as most gentry, have some knowledge of the theory of architecture, he can have none of the practice and must employ another.\\"Quoted in Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press), 1995, s.v. \\"Denham, Sir John;\\" Denham has a brief entry ex officio. There is no evidence that he personally designed any buildings, although he seems to have been a competent administrator; he may however have played some part in the design of his own home, Burlington House. John Webb was appointed Denham's deputy by 1664 and did Denham's work at Greenwich (from 1666) and elsewhere. =Second marriage to Margaret Brooke= Denham in 1665 made an unhappy second marriage to Margaret Brooke, a beautiful young woman almost thirty years his junior, who conducted a very public affair with the future King James II. To her husband's mortification, she insisted on being acknowledged publicly as a Royal mistress, saying that she would not, unlike her predecessor Goditha Price (daughter of Sir Herbert Price, the Master of the Household), \\"go up and down the back stairs\\".Diary of Samuel Pepys 10 June 1666 When she died in January 1667 after a short illness, Denham was rumoured, by Samuel Pepys among others, to have murdered her by giving her a poisoned cup of chocolate, although the autopsy found no trace of poison (she had been seriously ill the previous year). In any case rumour named several other possible poisoners, including James, his wife Anne Hyde and his sister-in-law, Lady Rochester.Diary of Samuel Pepys 10 November 1666, 7 January 1667 =Last years = His last years were clouded by dementia. With Denham's increasing mental incapacity, Charles II requested in March 1669 that Christopher Wren be appointed Denham's \\"sole deputy\\"; Wren succeeded him as King's Surveyor upon his death two weeks later. Denham was buried in Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. He was survived by his daughters, Elizabeth, who never married, and Anne, who married Sir William Morley, by whom she had a daughter Mary, who married James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby. Denham's second wife Margaret Brooke, painted by Peter Lely. Works Denham began his literary career with a tragedy, The Sophy (1641), but his poem, Cooper's Hill (1642), is the work by which he is remembered. It is the first example in English of a poem devoted to local description, picturing the Thames Valley scenery round his home at Egham in Surrey. Denham wrote many versions of this poem, reflecting the political and cultural upheavals of the Civil War. Gilfillan wrote of Denham and his contemporary Edmund Waller: \\"Neither Denham nor Waller were great poets; but they have produced lines and verses so good, and have, besides, exerted an influence so considerable on modern versification, and the style of poetical utterance, that they are entitled to a highly respectable place amidst the sons of British song.\\"George Gilfillan, \\"Life of Sir John Denham\\", in The Poetical Works of Edmund Waller and Sir John Denham, ed. George Gilfillan (Edinburgh: James Nichol, 1857), p. 203. He also received extravagant praise from Samuel Johnson, who quoted Denham's verse to exemplify the use of several words;Allen Reddick, The Making of Johnson‚Äôs Dictionary 1746-1773 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 166. but the place now assigned him is more humble.

Life  Engel was born and died in Parchim, in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He studied theology at Rostock and B√ºtzow,See entries of Johann Jakob Engel in Rostock Matrikelportal and philosophy at Leipzig, where he took his doctors' degree. In 1776 he was appointed professor of moral philosophy and belles- lettres in the Joachimstal gymnasium at Berlin, and a few years later he became tutor to the crown prince of Prussia, afterwards Frederick William III. The lessons which he gave his royal pupil in ethics and politics were published in 1798 under the title F√ºrstenspiegel (\\"Mirror for Princes\\"), and are a favourable specimen of his powers as a popular philosophical writer. In 1787 he was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, and in the same year he became director of the royal theatre, an office he resigned in 1794.  Works  Illustration from Ideen zu einer Mimik, 1785 Besides numerous dramas, some of which had a considerable success, Engel wrote several valuable books on aesthetic subjects. His Anfangsgr√ºnde einer Theorie der Dichtungsarten (\\"Initial foundations for a theory of poetry types,\\" 1783) showed fine taste and acute critical faculty if it lacked imagination and poetic insight. The same excellences and the same defects were apparent in his Ideen zu einer Mimik (1785), written in the form of letters. It demonstrated a knowledge of human nature, and may be regarded as a kind of manual for actors. His most popular work was Der Philosoph f√ºr die Welt (1775), which consists chiefly of dialogues on men and morals, written from the utilitarian standpoint of the philosophy of the day. His last work, a romance entitled Herr Lorenz Stark (1795), achieved a great success, by virtue of the marked individuality of its characters and its appeal to middle-class sentiment. He wanted to make the German theatre the mirror of the national life, and he wrote several plays, but they were of little merit ‚Äî Der dankbare Sohn and Edelknaben are examples.

The kinetochore assembles on the centromere and links the chromosome to microtubule polymers from the mitotic spindle during mitosis and meiosis. Its proteins also help to hold the sister chromatids together and play a role in chromosome editing. Details of the specific areas of origin are unknown. Monocentric organisms, including vertebrates, fungi, and most plants, have a single centromeric region on each chromosome which assembles a single, localized kinetochore. Holocentric organisms, such as nematodes and some plants, assemble a kinetochore along the entire length of a chromosome. Kinetochores start, control, and supervise the striking movements of chromosomes during cell division. During mitosis, which occurs after chromosomes are duplicated in S phase, two sister chromatids are held together by a centromere. Each chromatid has its own kinetochore, which face in opposite directions and attach to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle apparatus. Following the transition from metaphase to anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other, and the individual kinetochores on each chromatid drive their movement to the spindle poles that will define the two new daughter cells. The kinetochore is therefore essential for the chromosome segregation that is classically associated with mitosis and meiosis. Structure of Kinetochore The kinetochore contains two regions: * an inner kinetochore, which is tightly associated with the centromere DNA and assembled in a specialized form of chromatin that persists throughout the cell cycle; * an outer kinetochore, which interacts with microtubules; the outer kinetochore is a very dynamic structure with many identical components, which are assembled and functional only during cell division. Even the simplest kinetochores consist of more than 19 different proteins. Many of these proteins are conserved between eukaryotic species, including a specialized histone H3 variant (called CENP-A or CenH3) which helps the kinetochore associate with DNA. Other proteins in the kinetochore adhere it to the microtubules (MTs) of the mitotic spindle. There are also motor proteins, including both dynein and kinesin, which generate forces that move chromosomes during mitosis. Other proteins, such as Mad2, monitor the microtubule attachment as well as the tension between sister kinetochores and activate the spindle checkpoint to arrest the cell cycle when either of these is absent.Peter De Wulf, William C. Earnshaw, The Kinetochore: From Molecular Discoveries to Cancer Therapy The actual set of genes essential for kinetochore function varies from one species to another. Kinetochore functions include anchoring of chromosomes to MTs in the spindle, verification of anchoring, activation of the spindle checkpoint and participation in the generation of force to propel chromosome movement during cell division. On the other hand, microtubules are metastable polymers made of Œ±- and Œ≤-tubulin, alternating between growing and shrinking phases, a phenomenon known as dynamic instability. MTs are highly dynamic structures, whose behavior is integrated with kinetochore function to control chromosome movement and segregation. It has also been reported that the kinetochore organization differs between mitosis and meiosis and the integrity of meiotic kinetochore is essential for meiosis specific events such as pairing of homologous chromosomes, sister kinetochore monoorientation, protection of centromeric cohesin and spindle-pole body cohesion and duplication. =In animal cells= The kinetochore is composed of several layers, observed initially by conventional fixation and staining methods of electron microscopy, (reviewed by C. Rieder in 1982) and more recently by rapid freezing and substitution. Kinetochore structure and components in vertebrate cells. Based on Maiato et al. (2004). The deepest layer in the kinetochore is the inner plate, which is organized on a chromatin structure containing nucleosomes presenting a specialized histone (named CENP-A, which substitutes histone H3 in this region), auxiliary proteins, and DNA. DNA organization in the centromere (satellite DNA) is one of the least understood aspects of vertebrate kinetochores. The inner plate appears like a discrete heterochromatin domain throughout the cell cycle. External to the inner plate is the outer plate, which is composed mostly of proteins. This structure is assembled on the surface of the chromosomes only after the nuclear envelope breaks down. The outer plate in vertebrate kinetochores contains about 20 anchoring sites for MTs (+) ends (named kMTs, after kinetochore MTs), whereas a kinetochore's outer plate in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) contains only one anchoring site. The outermost domain in the kinetochore forms a fibrous corona, which can be visualized by conventional microscopy, yet only in the absence of MTs. This corona is formed by a dynamic network of resident and temporary proteins implicated in the spindle checkpoint, in microtubule anchoring, and in the regulation of chromosome behavior. During mitosis, each sister chromatid forming the complete chromosome has its own kinetochore. Distinct sister kinetochores can be observed at first at the end of G2 phase in cultured mammalian cells. These early kinetochores show a mature laminar structure before the nuclear envelope breaks down. The molecular pathway for kinetochore assembly in higher eukaryotes has been studied using gene knockouts in mice and in cultured chicken cells, as well as using RNA interference (RNAi) in C. elegans, Drosophila and human cells, yet no simple linear route can describe the data obtained so far. Fluorescence microscopy micrographs, showing the endogenous human protein Mad1 (one of the spindle checkpoint components) in green, along the different phases in mitosis; CENP-B, in red, is a centromeric marker, and DAPI (in blue) stains DNA The first protein to be assembled on the kinetochore is CENP-A (Cse4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This protein is a specialized isoform of histone H3. CENP-A is required for incorporation of the inner kinetochore proteins CENP-C, CENP-H and CENP-I/MIS6. The relation of these proteins in the CENP-A-dependent pathway is not completely defined. For instance, CENP-C localization requires CENP-H in chicken cells, but it is independent of CENP-I/MIS6 in human cells. In C. elegans and metazoa, the incorporation of many proteins in the outer kinetochore depends ultimately on CENP-A. Kinetochore proteins can be grouped according to their concentration at kinetochores during mitosis: some proteins remain bound throughout cell division, whereas some others change in concentration. Furthermore, they can be recycled in their binding site on kinetochores either slowly (they are rather stable) or rapidly (dynamic). * Proteins whose levels remain stable from prophase until late anaphase include constitutive components of the inner plate and the stable components of the outer kinetocore, such as the Ndc80 complex, KNL/KBP proteins (kinetochore-null/KNL-binding protein), MIS proteins and CENP-F. Together with the constitutive components, these proteins seem to organize the nuclear core of the inner and outer structures in the kinetochore. * The dynamic components that vary in concentration on kinetochores during mitosis include the molecular motors CENP-E and dynein (as well as their target components ZW10 and ROD), and the spindle checkpoint proteins (such as Mad1, Mad2, BubR1 and Cdc20). These proteins assemble on the kinetochore in high concentrations in the absence of microtubules; however, the higher the number of MTs anchored to the kinetochore, the lower the concentrations of these proteins. At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels diminish by a factor of about three to four as compared with free kinetochores, whereas dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 levels are reduced by a factor of more than 10 to 100. * Whereas the spindle checkpoint protein levels present in the outer plate diminish as MTs anchor, other components such as EB1, APC and proteins in the Ran pathway (RanGap1 and RanBP2) associate to kinetochores only when MTs are anchored. This may belong to a mechanism in the kinetochore to recognize the microtubules' plus-end (+), ensuring their proper anchoring and regulating their dynamic behavior as they remain anchored. A 2010 study used a complex method (termed \\"multiclassifier combinatorial proteomics\\" or MCCP) to analyze the proteomic composition of vertebrate chromosomes, including kinetochores. Although this study does not include a biochemical enrichment for kinetochores, obtained data include all the centromeric subcomplexes, with peptides from all 125 known centromeric proteins. According to this study, there are still about one hundred unknown kinetochore proteins, doubling the known structure during mitosis, which confirms the kinetochore as one of the most complex cellular substructures. Consistently, a comprehensive literature survey indicated that there had been at least 196 human proteins already experimentally shown to be localized at kinetochores. Function The number of microtubules attached to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals there can be 15‚Äì35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and they are responsible for spindle length) and some shorter ones are interdigitated between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores. =Chromosome anchoring to MTs in the mitotic spindle= Capturing MTs Chromosomes attach to the mitotic spindle through sister kinetochores, in a bipolar orientation During the synthesis phase (S phase) in the cell cycle, the centrosome starts to duplicate. Just at the beginning of mitosis, both centrioles in each centrosome reach their maximal length, centrosomes recruit additional material and their nucleation capacity for microtubules increases. As mitosis progresses, both centrosomes separate to establish the mitotic spindle. In this way, the spindle in a mitotic cell has two poles emanating microtubules. Microtubules are long proteic filaments with asymmetric extremes, a \\"minus\\"(-) end relatively stable next to the centrosome, and a \\"plus\\"(+) end enduring alternate phases of growing-shrinking, exploring the center of the cell. During this searching process, a microtubule may encounter and capture a chromosome through the kinetochore. Microtubules that find and attach a kinetochore become stabilized, whereas those microtubules remaining free are rapidly depolymerized. As chromosomes have two kinetochores associated back- to-back (one on each sister chromatid), when one of them becomes attached to the microtubules generated by one of the cellular poles, the kinetochore on the sister chromatid becomes exposed to the opposed pole; for this reason, most of the times the second kinetochore becomes attached to the microtubules emanating from the opposing pole, in such a way that chromosomes are now bi- oriented, one fundamental configuration (also termed amphitelic) to ensure the correct segregation of both chromatids when the cell will divide. Scheme showing cell cycle progression between prometaphase and anaphase. (Chromosomes are in blue and kinetochores in light yellow). When just one microtubule is anchored to one kinetochore, it starts a rapid movement of the associated chromosome towards the pole generating that microtubule. This movement is probably mediated by the motor activity towards the \\"minus\\" (-) of the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein, which is very concentrated in the kinetochores not anchored to MTs. The movement towards the pole is slowed down as far as kinetochores acquire kMTs (MTs anchored to kinetochores) and the movement becomes directed by changes in kMTs length. Dynein is released from kinetochores as they acquire kMTs and, in cultured mammalian cells, it is required for the spindle checkpoint inactivation, but not for chromosome congression in the spindle equator, kMTs acquisition or anaphase A during chromosome segregation. In higher plants or in yeast there is no evidence of dynein, but other kinesins towards the (-) end might compensate for the lack of dynein. Metaphase cells with low CENP-E levels by RNAi, showing chromosomes unaligned at the metaphase plate (arrows). These chromosomes are labeled with antibodies against the mitotic checkpoint proteins Mad1/Mad2. Hec1 and CENP-B label the centromeric region (the kinetochore), and DAPI is a specific stain for DNA. Another motor protein implicated in the initial capture of MTs is CENP-E; this is a high molecular weight kinesin associated with the fibrous corona at mammalian kinetochores from prometaphase until anaphase. In cells with low levels of CENP-E, chromosomes lack this protein at their kinetochores, which quite often are defective in their ability to congress at the metaphase plate. In this case, some chromosomes may remain chronically mono-oriented (anchored to only one pole), although most chromosomes may congress correctly at the metaphase plate. It is widely accepted that the kMTs fiber (the bundle of microtubules bound to the kinetochore) is originated by the capture of MTs polymerized at the centrosomes and spindle poles in mammalian cultured cells. However, MTs directly polymerized at kinetochores might also contribute significantly. The manner in which the centromeric region or kinetochore initiates the formation of kMTs and the frequency at which this happens are important questions, because this mechanism may contribute not only to the initial formation of kMTs, but also to the way in which kinetochores correct defective anchoring of MTs and regulate the movement along kMTs. Role of Ndc80 complex MTs associated to kinetochores present special features: compared to free MTs, kMTs are much more resistant to cold-induced depolymerization, high hydrostatic pressures or calcium exposure. Furthermore, kMTs are recycled much more slowly than astral MTs and spindle MTs with free (+) ends, and if kMTs are released from kinetochores using a laser beam, they rapidly depolymerize. When it was clear that neither dynein nor CENP-E is essential for kMTs formation, other molecules should be responsible for kMTs stabilitation. Pioneer genetic work in yeast revealed the relevance of the Ndc80 complex in kMTs anchoring. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ndc80 complex has four components: Ndc80p, Nuf2p, Spc24p and Spc25p. Mutants lacking any of the components of this complex show loss of the kinetochore-microtubule connection, although kinetochore structure is not completely lost. Yet mutants in which kinetochore structure is lost (for instance Ndc10 mutants in yeast) are deficient both in the connection to microtubules and in the ability to activate the spindle checkpoint, probably because kinetochores work as a platform in which the components of the response are assembled. The Ndc80 complex is highly conserved and it has been identified in S. pombe, C. elegans, Xenopus, chicken and humans. Studies on Hec1 (highly expressed in cancer cells 1), the human homolog of Ndc80p, show that it is important for correct chromosome congression and mitotic progression, and that it interacts with components of the cohesin and condensin complexes. Different laboratories have shown that the Ndc80 complex is essential for stabilization of the kinetochore- microtubule anchoring, required to support the centromeric tension implicated in the establishment of the correct chromosome congression in high eukaryotes. Cells with impaired function of Ndc80 (using RNAi, gene knockout, or antibody microinjection) have abnormally long spindles, lack of tension between sister kinetochores, chromosomes unable to congregate at the metaphase plate and few or any associated kMTs. There is a variety of strong support for the ability of the Ndc80 complex to directly associate with microtubules and form the core conserved component of the kinetochore-microtubule interface. However, formation of robust kinetochore-microtubule interactions may also require the function of additional proteins. In yeast, this connection requires the presence of the complex Dam1-DASH-DDD. Some members of this complex bind directly to MTs, whereas some others bind to the Ndc80 complex. This means that the complex Dam1-DASH-DDD might be an essential adapter between kinetochores and microtubules. However, in animals an equivalent complex has not been identified, and this question remains under intense investigation. =Verification of kinetochore‚ÄìMT anchoring= During S-Phase, the cell duplicates all the genetic information stored in the chromosomes, in the process termed DNA replication. At the end of this process, each chromosome includes two sister chromatids, which are two complete and identical DNA molecules. Both chromatids remain associated by cohesin complexes until anaphase, when chromosome segregation occurs. If chromosome segregation happens correctly, each daughter cell receives a complete set of chromatids, and for this to happen each sister chromatid has to anchor (through the corresponding kinetochore) to MTs generated in opposed poles of the mitotic spindle. This configuration is termed amphitelic or bi-orientation. However, during the anchoring process some incorrect configurations may also appear: Scheme showing different anchoring configurations between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle. * monotelic: only one of the chromatids is anchored to MTs, the second kinetochore is not anchored; in this situation, there is no centromeric tension, and the spindle checkpoint is activated, delaying entry in anaphase and allowing time for the cell to correct the error. If it is not corrected, the unanchored chromatid might randomly end in any of the two daughter cells, generating aneuploidy: one daughter cell would have chromosomes in excess and the other would lack some chromosomes. * syntelic: both chromatids are anchored to MTs emanating from the same pole; this situation does not generate centromeric tension either, and the spindle checkpoint will be activated. If it is not corrected, both chromatids will end in the same daughter cell, generating aneuploidy. * merotelic: at least one chromatid is anchored simultaneously to MTs emanating from both poles. This situation generates centromeric tension, and for this reason the spindle checkpoint is not activated. If it is not corrected, the chromatid bound to both poles will remain as a lagging chromosome at anaphase, and finally will be broken in two fragments, distributed between the daughter cells, generating aneuploidy. Both the monotelic and the syntelic configurations fail to generate centromeric tension and are detected by the spindle checkpoint. In contrast, the merotelic configuration is not detected by this control mechanism. However, most of these errors are detected and corrected before the cell enters in anaphase. A key factor in the correction of these anchoring errors is the chromosomal passenger complex, which includes the kinase protein Aurora B, its target and activating subunit INCENP and two other subunits, Survivin and Borealin/Dasra B (reviewed by Adams and collaborators in 2001). Cells in which the function of this complex has been abolished by dominant negative mutants, RNAi, antibody microinjection or using selective drugs, accumulate errors in chromosome anchoring. Many studies have shown that Aurora B is required to destabilize incorrect anchoring kinetochore-MT, favoring the generation of amphitelic connections. Aurora B homolog in yeast (Ipl1p) phosphorilates some kinetochore proteins, such as the constitutive protein Ndc10p and members of the Ndc80 and Dam1-DASH-DDD complexes. Phosphorylation of Ndc80 complex components produces destabilization of kMTs anchoring. It has been proposed that Aurora B localization is important for its function: as it is located in the inner region of the kinetochore (in the centromeric heterochromatin), when the centromeric tension is established sister kinetochores separate, and Aurora B cannot reach its substrates, so that kMTs are stabilized. Aurora B is frequently overexpressed in several cancer types, and it is currently a target for the development of anticancer drugs. =Spindle checkpoint activation= The spindle checkpoint, or SAC (for spindle assembly checkpoint), also known as the mitotic checkpoint, is a cellular mechanism responsible for detection of: * correct assembly of the mitotic spindle; * attachment of all chromosomes to the mitotic spindle in a bipolar manner; * congression of all chromosomes at the metaphase plate. When just one chromosome (for any reason) remains lagging during congression, the spindle checkpoint machinery generates a delay in cell cycle progression: the cell is arrested, allowing time for repair mechanisms to solve the detected problem. After some time, if the problem has not been solved, the cell will be targeted for apoptosis (programmed cell death), a safety mechanism to avoid the generation of aneuploidy, a situation which generally has dramatic consequences for the organism. Whereas structural centromeric proteins (such as CENP-B), remain stably localized throughout mitosis (including during telophase), the spindle checkpoint components are assembled on the kinetochore in high concentrations in the absence of microtubules, and their concentrations decrease as the number of microtubules attached to the kinetochore increases. At metaphase, CENP-E, Bub3 and Bub1 levels decreases 3 to 4 fold as compared to the levels at unattached kinetochores, whereas the levels of dynein/dynactin, Mad1, Mad2 and BubR1 decrease >10-100 fold. Thus at metaphase, when all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, all checkpoint proteins are released from the kinetochore. The disappearance of the checkpoint proteins out of the kinetochores indicates the moment when the chromosome has reached the metaphase plate and is under bipolar tension. At this moment, the checkpoint proteins that bind to and inhibit Cdc20 (Mad1-Mad2 and BubR1), release Cdc20, which binds and activates APC/CCdc20, and this complex triggers sister chromatids separation and consequently anaphase entry. Several studies indicate that the Ndc80 complex participates in the regulation of the stable association of Mad1-Mad2 and dynein with kinetochores. Yet the kinetochore associated proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, CENP-E, CENP-H and BubR1 are independent of Ndc80/Hec1. The prolonged arrest in prometaphase observed in cells with low levels of Ndc80/Hec1 depends on Mad2, although these cells show low levels of Mad1, Mad2 and dynein on kinetochores (<10-15% in relation to unattached kinetochores). However, if both Ndc80/Hec1 and Nuf2 levels are reduced, Mad1 and Mad2 completely disappear from the kinetochores and the spindle checkpoint is inactivated. Shugoshin (Sgo1, MEI-S332 in Drosophila melanogaster) are centromeric proteins which are essential to maintain cohesin bound to centromeres until anaphase. The human homolog, hsSgo1, associates with centromeres during prophase and disappears when anaphase starts. When Shugoshin levels are reduced by RNAi in HeLa cells, cohesin cannot remain on the centromeres during mitosis, and consequently sister chromatids separate synchronically before anaphase initiates, which triggers a long mitotic arrest. On the other hand, Dasso and collaborators have found that proteins involved in the Ran cycle can be detected on kinetochores during mitosis: RanGAP1 (a GTPase activating protein which stimulates the conversion of Ran- GTP in Ran-GDP) and the Ran binding protein called RanBP2/Nup358. During interphase, these proteins are located at the nuclear pores and participate in the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. Kinetochore localization of these proteins seem to be functionally significant, because some treatments that increase the levels of Ran-GTP inhibit kinetochore release of Bub1, Bub3, Mad2 and CENP-E. Orc2 (a protein that belongs to the origin recognition complex -ORC- implicated in DNA replication initiation during S phase) is also localized at kinetochores during mitosis in human cells; in agreement with this localization, some studies indicate that Orc2 in yeast is implicated in sister chromatids cohesion, and when it is eliminated from the cell, spindle checkpoint activation ensues. Some other ORC components (such orc5 in S. pombe) have been also found to participate in cohesion. However, ORC proteins seem to participate in a molecular pathway which is additive to cohesin pathway, and it is mostly unknown. =Force generation to propel chromosome movement= Most chromosome movements in relation to spindle poles are associated to lengthening and shortening of kMTs. One of the most interesting features of kinetochores is their capacity to modify the state of their associated kMTs (around 20) from a depolymerization state at their (+) end to polymerization state. This allows the kinetochores from cells at prometaphase to show \\"directional instability\\", changing between persistent phases of movement towards the pole (poleward) or inversed (anti-poleward), which are coupled with alternating states of kMTs depolymerization and polymerization, respectively. This kinetochore bi-stability seem to be part of a mechanism to align the chromosomes at the equator of the spindle without losing the mechanic connection between kinetochores and spindle poles. It is thought that kinetochore bi-stability is based upon the dynamic instability of the kMTs (+) end, and it is partially controlled by the tension present at the kinetochore. In mammalian cultured cells, a low tension at kinetochores promotes change towards kMTs depolymerization, and high tension promotes change towards kMTs polymerization. Kinetochore proteins and proteins binding to MTs (+) end (collectively called +TIPs) regulate kinetochore movement through the kMTs (+) end dynamics regulation. However, the kinetochore-microtubule interface is highly dynamic, and some of these proteins seem to be bona fide components of both structures. Two groups of proteins seem to be particularly important: kinesins which work like depolymerases, such as KinI kinesins; and proteins bound to MT (+) ends, +TIPs, promoting polymerization, perhaps antagonizing the depolymerases effect. * KinI kinesins are named \\"I\\" because they present an internal motor domain, which uses ATP to promote depolymerization of tubulin polymer, the microtubule. In vertebrates, the most important KinI kinesin controlling the dynamics of the (+) end assembly is MCAK. However, it seems that there are other kinesins implicated. * There are two groups of +TIPs with kinetochore functions. ** The first one includes the protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and the associated protein EB1, which need MTs to localize on the kinetochores. Both proteins are required for correct chromosome segregation. EB1 binds only to MTs in polymerizing state, suggesting that it promotes kMTs stabilization during this phase. ** The second group of +TIPs includes proteins which can localize on kinetochores even in absence of MTs. In this group there are two proteins that have been widely studied: CLIP-170 and their associated proteins CLASPs (CLIP-associated proteins). CLIP-170 role at kinetochores is unknown, but the expression of a dominant negative mutant produces a prometaphase delay, suggesting that it has an active role in chromosome alignment. CLASPs proteins are required for chromosome alignment and maintenance of a bipolar spindle in Drosophila, humans and yeast.

History There are traces of neolithic, Hallstatt, Roman and Alamanni settlements in or near Beinwil. However, Beinwil am See is first mentioned in 1036 as Beinwile. In 1045 it was mentioned as Peinuuilare. The noble von Beinwil family is first mentioned in 1153. This family was, in succession, vassals to the Lenzburg, Kyburg and Habsburgs before becoming extinct in the mid-14th Century. The family castle has disappeared. The power of Zwing und Bann (Manor rights as well as low justice) over the village, were inherited in about 1300 by the Stewards of Wolhusen, then donated in 1501 to Berom√ºnster, and sold in 1520 to Bern. The Counts of Hallwyl owned land on the lake (Dingst√§tte) to safeguard their maritime rights, which were first stipulated in 1419. Starting with the conquest of the Aargau in 1415 by Bern, until the French conquest and creation of the Helvetic Republic in 1798, the rights to high and low justice were held by the bailiff in Lenzburg. Following the collapse of the Helvetic Republic and the creation of the Canton of Aargau in the 1803 Act of Mediation, Beinwil came to the newly formed Canton. Religiously it originally belonging to the Pfeffikon parish, though it had a chapel that predates written records. This chapel was demolished in 1852. In 1528 the Reformation entered the village and it joined the Reformed parish of Reinach. It has been a separate parish since 1932, and in 1935 the local parish church was consecrated. In 1964 the Roman Catholic Church of St. Martin was built in the municipality to service the growing diaspora community of Menziken-Reinach. Economically, the decline in the 18th Century of imported cotton processing was mitigated by the increasingly dominant tobacco industry (first factory in 1841). Today, the industrial focus of the municipality is the manufacture of cigars, candy, glass and mirrors, electric motors, electronics and technology for testing construction materials. In 1990 the secondary sector provided 42% of jobs, while the tertiary sector provided 53%. About 55% of the work force commuted into the municipality while 59% of the work force commuted away.

(5 Cush.) 198 (1850), was a court case seeking to end racial discrimination in Boston public schools. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in favor of Boston, finding no constitutional basis for the suit. The case was later cited by the US Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the \\"separate but equal\\" standard. The 2004 book, Sarah's Long Walk: The Free Blacks of Boston and How Their Struggle for Equality Changed America, co-authored by Stephen and Paul Kendrick, explores this case, along with its social and political context. Overview Roberts v. Boston centered on Sarah C. Roberts, a five-year-old African-American girl. She was enrolled in Abiel Smith School, an underfunded all-black common school, far from her home in Boston, Massachusetts. Her father, Benjamin F. Roberts, also African-American, attempted to enroll her at closer, whites-only schools. After Sarah Roberts was denied on the basis of her race, and was physically removed from one school, her father wrote to the state legislature to seek a solution. Eventually, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts heard the case, in which Benjamin Roberts listed his daughter Sarah as the Plaintiff and the City of Boston as the Defendant. Not all African-Americans supported Roberts; most believed in \\"separate but equal\\" schooling and questioned the kind of education their children would receive from a white teacher. The defendant's attorney was Peleg Chandler, the plaintiff's attorneys were Charles Sumner and Robert Morris (one of the country's first African-American lawyers), and the judge was Lemuel Shaw. Sumner noted the distance that Sarah had to travel and the psychological trauma the girl would experience having to go to an all-black, sub-standard school.Sumner, Charles, Argument Against the Constitutionality of Separate Colored Schools, 1849. Despite the plaintiff's lawyers' best efforts, Shaw ruled for the defendant.Roberts v. City of Boston 5 Cush. (Mass.) 198 (1850). Roberts brought the issue to the state legislature with Sumner's help and in 1855, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts banned segregated schools in the state.Massachusetts Chapter 256, Desegregating Public Schools, 1855.

Friend after friend he gained and lost. Patron after patron he abused. They clothed and cleaned him and made him presentable, but he would drink himself to nakedness and rags and behave like a brute. Such from day to day and year to year was his life, and in the end he drank himself to death and perished in a miserable cottage near Lewisham. He was filled with conceit and a slave to his desires, but the lines that are fading away on the stone above his grave show that he was a poet. He is buried in the churchyard of St. Mary's church Lewisham. Works Dermody published two books of poems, which after his death were collected as The Harp of Erin. Some 56 of his sonnets being published in various works, from his first 1789 collection Poems to those published in 1792, with a few posthumously published verses in the biography by James Grant Raymond. Samuel Taylor Coleridge took an interest in some of his verse which had been included in the literary magazine The Anthologia Hibernica.

It is second in size in the Bas-Rhin only to Strasbourg, some to the south. To the north of the town, the Forest of Haguenau () is the largest undivided forest in France. Haguenau was founded by German dukes and has swapped back and forth several times between Germany and France over the centuries, with its spelling altering between \\"Hagenau\\" and \\"Haguenau\\" by the turn. After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Haguenau was ceded to the new German Empire. It was part of the German Empire for 48 years from 1871 to 1918, when at the end of World War I it was returned to France. This transfer was officially ratified in 1919 with the Treaty of Versailles. Haguenau is a rapidly growing town, its population having increased from 22,944 inhabitants in 1968 to 34,504 inhabitants in 2017.√âvolution et structure de la population en 2017: Commune de Haguenau (67180), INSEE Haguenau's urban area has grown from 40,375 inhabitants in 1968 to 59,796 inhabitants in 2017.√âvolution et structure de la population en 2017: Aire urbaine de Haguenau (133), INSEE History Haguenau dates from the beginning of the 12th century, when Duke Frederick II the One-Eyed (1090 - 6 April 1147) of Swabia erected a hunting lodge on an island in the Moder River. The medieval King and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa fortified the settlement and gave it town rights, important for further development, in 1154. On the site of the hunting lodge he founded an imperial palace he regarded as his favourite residence. In this palace were preserved the \\"Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empire\\", i.e. the jewelled imperial crown, sceptre, imperial orb, and sword of Charlemagne. Richard of Cornwall, King of the Romans, made it an imperial city in 1257. Subsequently, through Rudolph I of Germany (House of Habsburg) Haguenau became the seat of the of Hagenau, the German imperial advocate in Lower Alsace. In the 14th century, it housed the executive council of the Decapole, a defensive and offensive association of ten Alsatian towns against external aggression, economic expansion and related political instability. In the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Alsace was ceded to France, which had repeatedly invaded and looted the region in the past. In 1673 King Louis XIV had the fortifications as well as the remains of the king's palace razed in order to extinguish German traditions. Haguenau was recaptured by German troops in 1675, but was taken again by the French two years later, when it was nearly destroyed by fire set by looting French troops. In 1793 Prussians and Austrians had occupied Lower Alsace from the Lauter to Moder to support the Royalists and before the year's end were driven back over the border by the French Revolutionary Army, causing the ‚Äúgreat flight‚Äù. In 1871, Haguenau was ceded to the German Empire upon its victory in the Franco-Prussian War; the community was made part of Alsace-Lorraine, with its Germanic spelling-Hagenau-restored. The Haguenau Airport was built in 1916 by the German military to train fighter and bomber pilots to fight in the First World War.History . - Haguenau Aeroclub. Hagenau was part of the briefly independent Republic of Alsace-Lorraine after World War I, before being returned to France in 1919. =Second World War= In the Second World War, Germany retook the town in 1940. In November 1944 the area surrounding Haguenau was under the control of the 256th Volksgrenadier Division under the command of General Gerhard Franz.Clarke, Jeffrey J., and Robert Ross Smith (1993). - Riviera to the Rhine. - Washington, D.C.: Center of Military History. U.S. Army. - p.478. - . On 1 December 1944, the 314th Infantry Regiment of the 79th Division, XV Corps, 7th U.S. Army, moved into the area near Haguenau, and on 7 December the regiment was given the assignment to take it and the town forest just north that included German ammunition dumps. The attack began at 0645, 9 December, and sometime during the night of 10 December and the early morning of 11 December the Germans withdrew under the cover of darkness leaving the town proper largely under American control.The 314th Infantry Regiment - Haguenau . - The 314th Infantry Regiment - 79th Division, U.S. Army, World War II. Before they withdrew, the Germans demolished bridges, useful buildings, and even the town park. However, as experienced by Haguenau throughout its history, the Germans came back and retook the town in late January. Most of the inhabitants fled with the assistance of the U.S. Army. The Americans launched an immediate counterattack to retake the town.Stars and Stripes, Nancy, ed., Jan. 25 and 26, 1945 The 313th Infantry Regiment of the 79th Division was relieved by the 101st Airborne Division on 5 February 1945.Ambrose, p.225 The 36th Infantry Division would relieve the 101st on 23 February 1945.Ambrose, p.236 On March 15 the Allied Operation Undertone, a combined effort of the U.S. Seventh and French 1st Armies of the U.S. Sixth Army Group was launched to drive the Germans back along a 75 km line from Saarbr√ºcken to Haguenau. The last German soldier was not cleared out of the town until March 19, 1945, after house-to-house fighting. Much of the town had been destroyed despite the Allied reluctance to use artillery to clear out the Germans.Stars and Stripes, Nice, ed., Mar. 20, 1945 Technical Sergeant Morris E. Crain, Company E, 141st Infantry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for providing covering fire for his men on 13 March 1945. Population Economy The town has a well balanced economy. Centuries of troubled history in the buffer lands between France and Germany have given Haguenau a rich historical and cultural heritage which supports a lively tourist trade. There is also a thriving light manufacturing sector centred on the industrial zone to the west of the town. Here the presence nearby of significant retail developments testifies to Haguenau's importance as a regional commercial centre. The recent extension of the ring road has improved access to the commercial and industrial zones and reduced the traffic congestion which used to be a frequent challenge for vehicle drivers using the road which follows the line of the old town walls on the western side of town. Sights St. George's Church Historical Museum Fisher's gate Theatre =Architecture= In spite of the extensive destruction Haguenau suffered during the many wars experienced by Alsace, especially the Thirty Years War, the French conquest in 1677 and the Second World War, it still possesses monuments from nine centuries, even if nothing is left of arguably the most prestigious of them, Frederick I Barbarossa's imperial palace (Kaiserpfalz). Medieval Haguenau retains three gates from its former fortification, the Tour des Chevaliers (Tower of the knights), the Tour des P√™cheurs (Tower of the fishermen) and the Porte de Wissembourg (Wissembourg gate), two fairly large Gothic churches, Saint-Georges and Saint-Nicolas, an ancient water-mill and the old custom-house (Ancienne Douane). Both Saint- Georges and Saint-Nicolas Church have lost many of their artistic treasures over the centuries, especially their medieval stained glass windows and outside sculptures. Still, both display to this day some fine liturgical furniture (altars, choir stalls, organ cases, church tabernacles, calvaries...). Saint-Nicolas has become the receptacle for the baroque wooden decoration of the church of the destroyed Neubourg Abbey nearby. French Baroque and classicism has bequeathed the town several buildings, among which the former hospital and the current town hall. The Synagogue (1820) is a fine example of French Neo-classicism, as is the theatre (Th√©√¢tre municipal) (1846). The large Hop hall (Halle au houblon) is a good example of historicism in architecture. It was built by the French in 1867 and extended twice by the Germans, in 1881 and 1908. The Basilica of Our Lady in the locality of Marienthal is a vast Gothic Revival sanctuary (1863‚Äì1866). It keeps two early 15th-century statues, and a host of sculptures from around 1519. Haguenau's streets are adorned by attractive fountains, the medieval Saint-Georges fountain, the 18th-century Bee fountain (Fontaine aux abeilles) and the 1825 Dolphin fountain (Fontaine aux dauphins). =Museums= * Mus√©e historique de Haguenau (Historical Museum).

Professional life  He served for many years in the Navy Pay-Office, on retiring from which in 1830 he devoted himself to literary pursuits.  Literary life His liberal political views and literary interests brought him into contact with Leigh Hunt, the editor of The Examiner. He had in 1814-16 made a continuation of Robert Dodsley's Collection of English Plays, and in 1829 he became part proprietor and editor of Athenaeum magazine, the influence of which he greatly extended. In 1846 he resigned the editorship, and assumed that of the Daily News, but contributed to Athenaeum papers on Alexander Pope, Edmund Burke, Junius, and others. His grandson, Sir Charles Dilke, published these writings in 1875 under the title, Papers of a Critic. Thanks to his grandson, Dilke is also acknowledged as the author of ', published anonymously in 1821, which exercised an important influence on Marx.  Wentworth Place Around October 1816, Charles Wentworth Dilke and his friend Charles Armitage Brown moved into a pair of semi-detached houses later called Wentworth Place in Hampstead, London. The poet John Keats lived with Charles Brown around 1818-20 and was well known to Charles Dilke. In 1822 Charles Brown moved to Italy, selling his share of the property to Charles Dilke. Today Wentworth Place is known as Keats House and is a museum to John Keats. Personal life Dilke was married for 40 years to a \\"Yorkshire farmer's daughter\\" who died in 1850.

He was also active in organizing London's Great Exhibition of 1851. Early life He was born on 30 June 1821, at Great Ancoats in Manchester. His father was Abner Dixon of Holmfirth and Kirkburton in the West Riding of Yorkshire, his mother Mary Cryer. His uncle was the reform campaigner and manufacturer Elijah Dixon. His boyhood was passed in the hill country of Over Darwen, under the tuition of his grand-uncle, Michael Beswick. As a lad he became clerk to a merchant named Thompson at Manchester. Man of letters Early in 1846 Dixon decided on a literary career. He was for two months editor of the Cheltenham Journal. While at Cheltenham he won two principal essay prizes in Madden's Prize Essay Magazine. In the summer of 1846, on the recommendation of Douglas Jerrold, he moved to London. He entered the Inner Temple, but was not called to the bar until 1 May 1854. He never practised as a barrister. About 1850 Dixon was appointed a deputy-commissioner of the Great Exhibition of 1851. He helped to start more than one hundred out of three hundred committees then formed. After a long tour in Europe Dixon became, in January 1853, editor of The Athenaeum, to which he had been a contributor for some years. He remained editor until 1869.Retrieved 29 January 2020. Traveller 1872 caricature of Dixon entitled 'One farthing damages' In 1861 Dixon travelled in Portugal, Spain, and Morocco. In 1863 he travelled in the East, and on his return helped to found the Palestine Exploration Fund; Dixon was an active member of the executive committee, and eventually became chairman. In 1866 he travelled through the United States, going as far west as Salt Lake City. During this tour he discovered a collection of state papers, originally Irish, in the Public Library at Philadelphia. They had been missing since the time of James II, and on Dixon's suggestion were given to the British government.With them was found the original manuscript of the Marquis of Clanricarde's ‚ÄòMemoirs‚Äô from 23 October 1641 to 30 August 1643, which were supposed to have been destroyed, and of which mention had been made in Hardy's Report on the Carte and Carew Papers. In autumn 1867 Dixon travelled through the Baltic provinces. In the latter part of 1869 he travelled for some months in Russia. During 1871 he was mostly in Switzerland. Shortly afterwards he was sent to Spain on a financial mission by a council of foreign bondholders. On 4 October 1872 he was created a knight commander of the Crown by Kaiser Wilhelm I. In the September 1874 he travelled through Canada and the United States; in the latter part of 1875 he travelled once more in Italy and Germany. Politician and activist At the general election of 1868 Dixon declined an invitation to stand for Marylebone, though he frequently addressed political meetings. In August 1869 he resigned the editorship of the Athen√¶um. Soon afterwards he was appointed justice of the peace for Middlesex and Westminster. Dixon took a leading part in establishing the Shaftesbury Park Estate and other centres of improved dwellings for the labouring classes. He was a member of the first School Board for London (1870). During the first three years of the School Board's existence Dixon's labours were extensive. In direct opposition to Lord Sandon he succeeded in carrying a resolution which thenceforth established military drill in all rate-paid schools in the metropolis. About 1873 Dixon began a movement for opening the Tower of London free of charge to the public. To this proposal the prime minister Benjamin Disraeli assented, and on public holidays Dixon personally conducted crowds of working men through the building. Later life Caricature by Frederick Waddy Dixon lost most of his savings, invested in Turkish stock. On 2 October 1874 his house near Regent's Park, 6 St. James's Terrace, was completely wrecked by an explosion of gunpowder on Regent's Canal. He lost his eldest daughter, and his eldest son, William Jerrold Dixon, to a sudden death in Dublin, on 20 October 1879. However, his youngest daughter, Ella Hepworth Dixon, became a writer, editor and novelist of some repute.ODNB entry for Ella Hepworth Dixon, by Nicola Beauman: Retrieved 25 July 2013. Pay-walled. Dixon was a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, of the Society of Antiquaries of London, of the Pennsylvania Society, and of other learned associations. Before the close of 1878 he visited Cyprus. There a fall from his horse broke his shoulder-bone, and he was left an invalid. He was revising the proof sheets of the concluding volumes of Royal Windsor and on Friday 26 December 1879, made an effort to finish the work. He died in his bed on the following morning from a seizure. On 2 January 1880 he was buried in Highgate cemetery. Works Before he was of age Dixon wrote a five-act tragedy, The Azamoglan, which was privately printed. In 1842‚Äì3 he wrote articles signed W. H. D. in the North of England Magazine. In December 1843 he first wrote under his own name in Douglas Jerrold's Illuminated Magazine. He became a contributor to the Athen√¶um and the Daily News. Dixon was criticised for inaccuracy as an author. =Social issues= In the Daily News Dixon published a series of startling papers on The Literature of the Lower Orders, which may have suggested Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor. Another series of articles, descriptive of the London Prisons, led to his work, John Howard and the Prison World of Europe, which appeared in 1849, and though declined by many publishers then passed through three editions. =History and biography= \\"He discovered New America and Free Russia\\" Dixon as caricatured by alt=Dixon's Life of William Penn was published in 1851; in a supplementary chapter \\"Macaulay's charges against Penn\\",‚Äô eight in number, were elaborately answered. Thomas Babington Macaulay never took notice of these criticisms. In 1852 Dixon published a life of Robert Blake, Admiral and General at Sea, based on Family and State Papers. In 1854 he began researches on Francis Bacon. He had leave, through Lord Stanley and Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, to inspect the \\"State Papers\\", until then jealously guarded from the general view by successive secretaries of state. He published four articles criticising John Campbell's Life of Bacon in the Athen√¶um for January 1860. These were enlarged and republished as The Personal History of Lord Bacon from Unpublished Papers in 1861. He published separately as a pamphlet in 1861 A Statement of the Facts in regard to Lord Bacon's Confession, and a more elaborate volume called The Story of Lord Bacon's Life, 1862. Dixon's books on Bacon have not been valued by scholars. Some of Dixon's papers in the Athen√¶um led to the publication of the Auckland Memoirs and of Court and Society, edited by the Duke of Manchester. To the latter he contributed a memoir of Queen Catherine. In 1869 Dixon brought out the first two volumes of Her Majesty's Tower, which he completed two years afterwards by the publication of the third and fourth volumes. While in Spain Dixon wrote most of his History of Two Queens, i.e. Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. The work expanded into four volumes, the first half of which was published in 1873, containing the life of Catherine of Aragon, and the second half in 1874, containing the life of Anne Boleyn. In 1878 appeared the first two volumes of his four-volumed work Royal Windsor. =Religion= Dixon's book Spiritual Wives (1868), treating partly Mormonism, was accused of indecency. He brought an action for libel against the Pall Mall Gazette which had made the charge in a review of Free Russia. He obtained a verdict for one farthing (29 November 1872). =Travel books= In 1865 Dixon published The Holy Land, a picturesque handbook to Palestine. In 1867 he published his ‚ÄòNew America.‚Äô It passed through eight editions in England, three in America, and several in France, Russia, Holland, Italy, and Germany. In 1872 he published The Switzers. In March 1875 he wrote on North America in The White Conquest. Other books of travel were Free Russia (1870), and British Cyprus (1879). =Novels= In 1877 Dixon published his first romance, in 3 volumes: Diana, Lady Lyle. Another three-volume work of fiction followed in 1878: Ruby Grey. =Other works= During a panic in 1851 Dixon brought out an anonymous pamphlet, The French in England, or Both Sides of the Question on Both Sides of the Channel, arguing against the possibility of a French invasion. In 1861 he edited the Memoirs of Sydney, Lady Morgan, who had appointed him her literary executor. During 1876 he wrote in the Gentleman's Magazine \\"The Way to Egypt\\", as well as two other papers in which he recommended the government to purchase from Turkey its Egyptian suzerainty. In 1872 under the pseudonym Onslow Yorke he published an expos√© of the International Workingmen's Association The Secret History of \\"The International\\" Working Men's Association, which following the Bolshevik Revolution was republished by the British far right in 1921.

He was the 15th governor of Texas from 1874 to 1876 and represented Texas in the U.S. Senate from 1877 to 1895. His uncle was Congressman Richard Coke, Jr.. Early life and education Richard Coke was born in 1829 in Williamsburg, Virginia, to John and Eliza (Hankins) Coke. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1848 with a law degree. Texas and career In 1850, he moved to Texas and opened a law practice in Waco. In 1852, he married Mary Horne of Waco. The couple had four children, but all of them died before age 30. Coke was a delegate to the Secession Convention at Austin in 1861. He joined the Confederate Army as a private.http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=C000601 US Congressional bioguide In 1862, he raised a company that became part of the 15th Texas Infantry and served as its captain for the rest of the war. He was wounded in an action known as Bayou Bourbeau on November 3, 1863, near Opelousas, Louisiana. After the war, he returned home to Waco. Reconstruction In 1865, Coke was appointed a Texas district court judge, and in 1866, he was elected as an associate justice to the Texas Supreme Court. The following year, the military Governor-General Philip Sheridan fired Coke and four other judges as ‚Äòan impediment to reconstruction‚Äô, in pursuit of unionist Reconstruction policies. The firing of the five judges became a cause c√©l√®bre and made their names famous, synonymous in the public eye with resistance to Union occupation. No one benefited more from prevailing public sentiment than Richard Coke, who in 1873, leveraged resentment at Union occupation to construct a Democratic electoral coalition that ruled Texas for more than 100 years. This Democratic power was based on disfranchisement of blacks, Mexican Americans, and poor whites through the use of poll taxes and white primaries. For example, the number of black voters decreased sharply from more than 100,000 in the 1890s to 5,000 in 1906. Having been fired by Sheridan, Coke ran for governor as a Democrat in 1873 and took office in January 1874. The Texas Supreme Court ‚Äì forever after known as the \\"Semicolon Court\\" due to this case ‚Äì ruled his election invalid in an extraordinary habeas corpus writ styled Ex Parte Rodriguez. https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/jps01 As recounted by the Texas State Historical Association, in response, > Disregarding the court ruling, the Democrats secured the keys to the second > floor of the Capitol and took possession.

He was also instrumental in creating the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, which became Texas A&M; University. Having once been fired from the Texas Supreme Court, as governor, he appointed all its members, naming as Chief Justice Oran Roberts (after the US Senate had refused to seat him). George F. Moore, who was Chief Justice when he had been fired along with Coke, became the first chief justice elected under Texas' 1876 Constitution, an honor he held until his death. Others from the Texas judiciary under the Confederacy received key appointments. Once the new Constitution had been negotiated, Coke resigned his office in December 1876, following his election by the legislature to the United States Senate. He was re-elected to federal office in 1882 and 1888, serving in the 45th ‚Äì 53rd Congresses until March 3, 1895. Coke was not a candidate for reelection in 1894. Coke retired to his home in Waco and his nearby farm. He became ill after suffering exposure while fighting a flood of the Brazos River in April 1897. After a short illness, he died at his home in Waco and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery. Coke County in West Texas is named in his honor.

Types  = Thyroid surgery = Surgery of the thyroid gland constitutes the bulk of endocrine surgical procedures worldwide. This may be done for a variety of conditions, help ranging from benign multinodular goiter to thyroid cancer. In the United Kingdom it was developed as a separate specialty from general surgery by Richard Welbourne and John Lynn, surgeons at what was then the 'Royal Postgraduate Medical School' and is now the Hammersmith Hospital and contains the Department of Thyroid and Endocrine Surgery staffed by consultant surgeons Professor Fausto Palazzo, Professor Neil Tolley and Miss Aimee Di Marco. Operations involve removal of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) either as a part of the gland (lobectomy or hemithyroidectomy), or the whole gland (total thyroidectomy). Incomplete resections (sub-total or near total thyroidectomy) are also infrequently performed, but are disfavored by most surgeons. = Parathyroid surgery = Removal of the parathyroid gland(s) is referred to as parathyroidectomy and is most commonly performed for primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy is also performed to treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism arising from chronic kidney failure. = Adrenal surgery = adrenalectomy, i.e. surgical removal of the adrenal gland is done in conditions like Conn syndrome, pheochromocytoma, adreno-cortical cancer etc. = Pancreatic surgery = Diseases of the endocrine pancreas occur very infrequently; these include insulinomas, gastrinomas etc. Surgery for these conditions range from simple tumor enucleation to more larger resections. Development Endocrine surgery is generally well developed. Endocrine surgery has developed as a sub- specialty surgical category because of the technical nature of these operations and the associated risks of operating in the neck. In Surgery: Basic Science and Clinical Evidence, the book the efficacy prior research: In the 1970s, a specialty training program at Hammersmith Hospital was the primary location for early work in training a large number of surgeons. It is well established that complications are much less common if performed by surgeons who do at least 100 thyroid operations per year. In the United Kingdom most thyroid surgery is performed by surgeons doing less than 20 thyroid operations per year. Permanent damage to both voice box nerves is an extreme rarity and needs in most cases a permanent tracheostomy. Data on the outcomes of all surgeons performing endocrine surgery in the UK is publicly available via the 'British Association of Endocrine and Thyroid Surgeons' website.  Technique  = Thyroid surgery = Some surgical teams leave wound drains in place after surgery to the thyroid gland. There is no strong evidence that wound drains improve outcomes following surgery and there is low-quality evidence that wound drains increase the length of time a person stays in the hospital following thyroid surgery.

What fate meets them there is usually left ambiguous.  The Mountains High  The original English ballads, most of which date to the Victorian era, are generally found under the title The Mountains High. In the original story, Ranordine (also given as Rinordine, Rinor Dine, Ryner Dyne, Rine-a-dine, Rynadine, Retterdyne, Randal Rhin or Randal Rine) is a bandit or outlaw who encounters a young woman in the wilderness and seduces or abducts her. The song ends with a warning to young women to beware of strange men. \\"The Mountains High\\" appears not to be very old, since only one version was collected before 1800. A version appears in George Petrie's 1855 collection of ballads; other variants appear in a number of broadside ballads from the nineteenth century. Washington Irving relates that the song had crossed the Atlantic and was being sung in Kentucky before 1832, and spread through North America in the nineteenth century as well. A text of a circa 1814 broadside :A new Song, called the :MOUTAINS [sic] HIGH. :ONE evening in my rambles two miles below Pimroy,Pomeroy is in Tyrone in Ireland. The song the Mountains of Pomeroy has many similarities with this song :I met a farmer's daughter all on the mountains high, :Her beauty so enticed me, I could not pass her by, :So with my gun I'll guard her, all on the mountains high. :I said my pretty creature I'm glad to meet you here, :On these lonesome mountains, your beauty shines so clear, :She said kind sir, be civil, my company forsake, :For it is my opinion I fear you are some rake. :Said he I am no rake, I'm brought up in Venus' train,The significance of \\"brought up in Venus' train\\" is unclear. The \\"train\\" may refer to Venus' ladies-in-waiting, in which case the phrase might indicate that Rynadine is accustomed to the company of beautiful women. How this would distinguish him from a rake is not immediately apparent. :I'm seeking for concealment, all in the judge's name, :Oh! if my parents they did know your life they would destroy,This line and the next are presumably spoken by the young lady. :For keeping of my company, all on the mountains high. :I said my pretty creature don't let your parents know, :For if you do they'll ruin me and prove my overthrow, :This pretty little young thing she stood all in amaze, :With eyes as bright as Amber upon me she did gaze. :Her ruby lips and cherry cheeks, the lass of Firmadie,Firmadie also does not appear to be an actual place-name. Most versions have \\"they lost their former dye\\" as the half-line instead. :She fainted in my arms there, all on the mountains high, :When I had kissed her once or twice, she came to herself again, :And said kind Sir be civil and tell to me your name. :Go down in yonder forest, my castle there you'll find, :Well wrote in ancient history, my name is Rynadine: :Come all you pretty fair maids, a warning take by me, :Be sure you quit night walking, and shun bad company, :For if you don't you are sure to rue until the day you die :Beware of meeting Rynadine all on the mountains high. :::::Wood, Printer, Liverpool.  A. L. Lloyd's contributions  According to folklorist Stephen Winick, although the name \\"Reynardine\\" is found in one 19th century version, the association with foxes, as well as Reynardine's supernatural characteristics, first arise in connection with a fragment of the ballad (a single stanza) that was collected in 1904 by Herbert Hughes. The source's recollection of the ballad was that Reynardine was an Irish \\"fa√´ry\\" who could turn into a fox. This ability (which is not suggested in any extant version of \\"The Mountains High\\") may have derived from the word \\"Reynardine\\": renard is French for \\"fox,\\" deriving from the trickster figure Reynard. Winick points out that Hughes and a friend named Joseph Campbell (not to be confused with the mythologist) wrote short poems incorporating this stanza and the fox interpretation, aspects of which A. L. Lloyd in turn adapted for his versions of \\"Reynardine\\" (see Winick 2004). Winick also shows that Lloyd's versions incorporate several striking turns of phrase, including \\"sly, bold Reynardine\\" and \\"his teeth did brightly shine\\", that are found neither in the original ballads, nor in Hughes' or Campbell's versions. Lloyd generally represented his versions of \\"Reynardine\\" as \\"authentic\\" folksongs (going so far as to claim to have collected the song from one \\"Tom Cook, of Eastbridge, Suffolk\\"), but this informant has never apparently been encountered by any other collector. Lloyd's claims have led to the current state of confusion; few modern singers know that the \\"werefox\\" interpretation of the ballad is not traditional. Lloyd's reworkings are certainly more interesting to the modern listener than the simple and moralistic original ballads, and have gained far greater interest from singers and songwriters; his versions of \\"Reynardine\\" have served as inspiration for many additional modern reworkings.  Modern recordings  Modern versions of the song have been recorded for the following albums: *1964: Folk Roots, New Routes by Shirley Collins and Davy Graham *1967: Fire & Fleet & Candlelight by Buffy Sainte-Marie *1969: Liege & Lief by Fairport Convention *1969: Prince Heathen by Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick *1971: Anne Briggs by Anne Briggs *1971: Rosemary Lane by Bert Jansch *1972: On the Mountains High by Margaret MacArthur *1976: Airs and Graces by June Tabor *1977: A Maid in Bedlam by John Renbourn *1977: Dark Ships in the Forest by Roberts and Barrand *1992: Weaving my Ancestors' Voices by Sheila Chandra *1993: Live in Concert by Green Fields of America *2001: Arthur the King by Maddy Prior *2002: Retterdyne by Zoe Speaks on album Birds Fly South *2003: Country Life by Show of Hands *2005: Milkwhite Sheets by Isobel Campbell *2008: Changing Trains by Mozaik *2010: Genuine Negro Jig by Carolina Chocolate Drops *2012: La Strega and the Cunning Man In the Smoke by Dylan Carlson (as Drcarlsonalbion) *2015: Falling with a Thousand Stars and Other Wonders from the House Of Albion by Dylan Carlson (as Drcarlsonalbion) and Coleman Grey *2016: On the Lonesome Plain by Donal Clancy (son of Liam Clancy) *2017: Trails and Tribulations by Martin Simpson See also *Reynard the Fox References * Winick, Stephen. 2004. \\"A.

The town, founded in the Middle Ages, lies in the Seetal valley, about 3 kilometres south of the Aare river. Lenzburg and the neighbouring municipalities of Niederlenz and Staufen have grown together in an agglomeration. History Coat of Arms from Lenzburg castle, showing some of the history of the castle. At the bottom, the coat of arms of the von Erlach family, above that the flag of the canton of Bern, all topped by the Reichsadler of the Holy Roman Empire. A Neolithic grave field of the Cortaillod culture has been discovered on the Goffersberg (close to the Lenzburg Castle) dating from 4300 - 3500 BCE. A Roman theater was uncovered when a motorway was built in 1964. It was part of a small settlement with 500 inhabitants that existed for approximately 200 years. The settlement was abandoned in the 3rd century. In the 5th and 6th centuries, an Alamanni settlement existed. Lenzburg is first mentioned in 924 as de Lencis. In 1036, Lenzburg Castle was used for the first time as seat for the Count of Lenzburg, then an important lord. The house however died out in 1173, and the castle was then transferred to emperor Frederick Barbarossa. In the following period, it was mainly used by the Kyburger house. The Habsburgs took over the castle in 1273. City rights were granted in 1306. Castle Lenzburg in 1642 Lenzburg was conquered by Bern in 1415, along with the western part of current Aargau, though Bern did not take away its city rights. In 1433, the city of Bern bought the castle and used it to govern the region from 1444 to 1798. A major fire devastated the town in 1491, sparing only fifteen houses. The Reformation was carried out simultaneously with the rest of the region in 1528, and the economy started to transform slowly from an agrarian to a more industrial one in the 16th century. In the 18th century Lenzburg developed into a centre for cotton trade and processing. An Indienne textile factory was founded in 1732. In 1798, the Helvetian Republic was proclaimed and the lords from Bern were ousted. The canton of Aargau was founded and Lenzburg became a district capital in 1803. In 1830, a series of meetings were held in Lenzberg to discuss changing the cantonal constitution. When peaceful negotiation with the cantonal authorities in Aarau failed to produce results, Johann Heinrich Fischer from Merenschwand called for a rebel militia from the Frei√§mter to force the government to change, in what was known as the Frei√§mtersturm. On 6 December 1830, his rebel troops marched toward Lenzberg on their way to Aarau. At Lenzberg, about 100 government soldiers formed to resist the militia, and brought their guns in position. The Frei√§mter militia ran toward the militia with wild battle cries, and the government soldiers broke and ran without firing a shot. By 6pm the militia entered Aarau and the commander of government troops surrendered without any resistance. Debenture of Lenzburg, issued 10. August 1885 Lenzburg transformed into the economic centre of the region in the second half of the 19th century. On 23 June 1874, Lenzburg was connected to the Aargauische S√ºdbahn railway. On 6 September 1877 the Schweizerische Nationalbahn opened a line from Wettingen to Zofingen as part of a plan to connect Singen, Germany and Lake Geneva in competition with the established railway companies. The line went bankrupt in 1878 and was taken over by the Schweizerische Nordostbahn. The bankruptcy of the Nationalbahn brought Lenzburg to the brink of economic ruin, as the city itself was heavily involved in financing it. Paying back the city's debt took half a century. The castle changed hands several times in the 19th and 20th century. In 1860, it was bought by Frank Wedekind, a poet from Germany. In 1893, it was purchased by Americans and renovated. Finally, in 1956, it was bought by the canton and since been used to house a museum.

It runs with the help of JDK (Java Development Kit). BlueJ was developed to support the learning and teaching of object-oriented programming, and its design differs from other development environments as a result. The main screen graphically shows the class structure of an application under development (in a UML-like diagram), and objects can be interactively created and tested. This interaction facility, combined with a clean, simple user interface, allows easy experimentation with objects under development. Object-oriented concepts (classes, objects, communication through method calls) are represented visually and in its interaction design in the interface.  History  The development of BlueJ was started in 1999 by Michael K√∂lling and John Rosenberg at Monash University, as a successor to the Blue system. BlueJ is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Blue was an integrated system with its own programming language and environment, and was a relative of the Eiffel language. BlueJ implements the Blue environment design for the Java programming language. In March 2009, the BlueJ project became free and open source software, and licensed under GNU GPL with the classpath exception. BlueJ is currently being maintained by a team at King's College London, England, where K√∂lling works.  Functionality  BlueJ has a simpler interface than most professional IDEs, but its functionality is not a subset of those kinds of environment. While many of the standard development tools exist, such as an editor, compiler and runtime environment, it also offers tools that are specific to its educational goals and not found in this form in common professional environments. These includes interactive object creation and method invocation (via the \\"Object Bench\\"), simplified debugging and teamwork controls, interactive, line-based expression and statement evaluation (via the \\"Code Pad\\"), and automated creation of JUnit classes from recordings of interactive test sequences. = Visualisation = The BlueJ interface emphasises class structure (in preference of source code) by showing a UML- like diagram as its main screen. Class structures can be manipulated by the user, and the class relation display is generated automatically from the source code. Source level structure is visualised through scope highlighting (the visual emphasis of lexical scope through use of graphical frames and background colour). = Interaction and experimentation = Supported interaction features include the ability to create objects interactively for ad-hoc testing and experimentation, and support for interactive invocation of public methods. Parameters may be passed and objects can be composed in interactive calls. Interactive tests may be recorded and stored as standard unit test classes. Code fragments can be evaluated interactively in the Code Pad, which provides a Java-based REPL. = Supported languages = BlueJ supports programming in Java and in Stride.Stride Java support has been provided in BlueJ since its inception, while Stride support was added in 2017.

In its application for a full-time licence, Crash FM said it would provide an alternative rock and dance station, aimed at 15- to 34-year-olds, with a target audience of over 80,000 tuning in for around eight hours per week in the first year. The original shareholders also included CLT, although they withdrew before launch with their 25% stake taken by Channel Radio. =Juice 107.6= Crash was bought out by Forever Broadcasting in late 1999 and relaunched as Juice 107.6 on 26 March 2000. By September of that year, the station's RAJAR had increased significantly, after its format had been altered to include more mainstream pop and dance music. In September 2003, Juice was sold to Absolute Radio (UK) Limited (AR-UK), a consortium made up of UTV Media and Eurocast, for ¬£3.1m. AR-UK were, at the time, making moves in the FM radio licence world, notably in the West Midlands and Glasgow. The new owners aimed to develop more local programming, news and marketing but sold the station to UTV less than two years later. On 12 January 2012, Juice switched from its Fleet Street studios to a new ¬£1.1m facility at One Park West in Liverpool One, overlooking the Albert Dock. =Capital Liverpool= On 5 June 2015, Juice FM was sold again to Global for ¬£10 million.Juice FM sold to Global to expand Capital, Radio Today, 5 June 2015UTV Media sells Juice FM to Global Radio for ¬£10m, theguardian.com, 5 June 2015 The sale was given regulatory approval from the Competition and Markets Authority exactly three months later, following a consultation.

But as of RAJAR Q2 2019, after significant changes to the initial lineup, the numbers had recovered to 212,000 reach, with vast improvements in market share and listening hours to the two years after the rebranding. On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed the station's local breakfast and weekend shows would be replaced with networked programming from April 2019. The weekday drivetime show was retained alongside news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

It served the Brighton and Hove area broadcasting on 107.2 FM and across Sussex on DAB. In April 2019, the station was merged with a sister Capital station in Hampshire to form Capital South. History =Surf 107= The station was first launched as Surf 107 in March 1998, when the Radio Authority licensed Brighton and Hove Local Radio Ltd to broadcast on a commercial basis to the Brighton and Hove area. Co-founders Daniel Nathan and Eugene Perera had previously run a series of trial broadcasts in the city beginning with Festival Radio 97.7 operating under a Home Office special events radio licence in May 1990 during the Brighton Festival and in subsequent years using a Radio Authority restricted service licence from 1991 to 1993. Writer and broadcaster Simon Fanshawe was the first chairman of the company with Eugene Perera as managing director. Various local companies held shares. Surf 107 began broadcasting on Friday 27 March 1998 and went on to win its first Sony Award a year later. =Juice 107.2= Logo used by Juice 107.2In December 2000, the radio station was sold to Forever Broadcasting plc which rebranded the station as Juice 107.2. In August 2003, Daniel Nathan led a group of local investors with the aim of returning the station to local ownership. In 2011, Juice 107.2 managing director Ryan Heal was recognised as an Outstanding Brightonian for his stewardship at the radio station and leadership within the community. By this point, Juice 107.2 was required to pay for simulcast on the emerging DAB digital radio platform. The company's directors did not consider the format suitable or financially sustainable and began lobbying parliament. In September 2012, in order to demonstrate an alternative approach to DAB, senior Ofcom engineer Rashid Mustapha together with Daniel Nathan initiated an experimental low cost DAB transmission that ran from the Juice 107.2 rack room and transmission site from September 2012 to January 2013 using open-source software. This work was commended in parliament by the Minister of State Ed Vaizey in November 2013. An official trial was set in motion and on 31 July 2015, the Juice DIY DAB multiplex went live. In the same month, radio group UKRD acquired a 51% majority holding in the broadcaster, with Daniel Nathan remaining as chairman and local shareholders retaining the minority stake. In August 2016, UKRD returned its holding in Juice to local investors. As part of the sale, Laurence Elphick, who had departed as Juice managing director in 2014, returned to the post. In late October 2016, Ofcom's report concluded that the small scale trials had been a success. In March 2017, the Brighton multiplex became UK's first to only broadcast DAB+. A month later, the work that began as an experiment in Brighton was officially recognised when the Private Members‚Äô Small-Scale DAB Bill received Royal Assent to pass into law as an Act of Parliament. paving the way for a new generation of low cost DAB transmission around the UK. =Capital Brighton= In January 2018, Global Radio announced it had bought Juice 107.2 for an undisclosed sum.Global buys Juice 107.2 in Brighton & Hove, RadioToday, 17 January 2018 The sale was expected to be finalised the following month.

He edited Horace Walpole's Journal of the Reign of George III.. Among other posts, Doran was for a short time editor of The Athenaeum. Life He was born in London on 11 March 1807. Both his parents were Irish: his father, John Doran, was a native of Drogheda, who after the Irish rebellion of 1798 went to England, and as a naval contractor was captured by the French. He was kept in France for three years, and acquired a knowledge of French, which he passed on to his son. When very young John Doran was sent to Matheson's Academy in Margaret Street, Cavendish Square. Before he was seventeen he was an orphan. His knowledge of French earned for him in the early part of 1823 an appointment as tutor to the eldest son of James Murray, 1st Baron Glenlyon. He travelled on the continent for five years with his pupil George Murray. From 1828 to 1837 he was tutor to Lord Rivers, and to the sons of Lord Harewood and of Lord Portman. After giving up his last tutorship, Doran travelled on the continent for two or three years, and took a doctor's degree in the faculty of philosophy at the University of Marburg in Prussia. Returning to England he became a professional writer, and settled in St. Peter's Square, Hammersmith. In 1841 he began as literary editor of the Church and State Gazette until 1852. Soon afterwards he became a regular contributor to the Athen√¶um. He became closely connected with William Hepworth Dixon, the editor, and during Dixon's absences acted as his substitute. In August 1869, on the death of Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, Doran for about a year succeeded Dixon as editor. On the retirement of William John Thoms, Doran was appointed to the editorship of Notes and Queries. Doran died at Notting Hill on 25 January 1878, and was buried on 29 January at Kensal Green. Works At the age of seventeen Doran wrote a melodrama Justice, or the Venetian Jew, which was on 8 April 1824 produced at the Surrey Theatre. Before leaving England Doran had begun writing on the London Literary Chronicle (absorbed in the Athen√¶um in 1828), and during his time abroad he became a regular contributor. A collection of his Parisian sketches and Paris letters appeared in 1828 under the title of Sketches and Reminiscences. Doran began in 1830 to supply the Bath Journal with lyrical translations from the French, German, Latin, and Italian, two of his favourite authors being B√©ranger and Catullus. In 1835 he published the History of Reading. In 1852 Doran published the memoir of Marie Th√©r√®se Charlotte, Madame Royale, under the title of Filia Dolorosa. The first 115 pages had been written by Isabella Frances Romer, who died, leaving the fragment. In 1852 he also edited a new edition of Charles Anthon's text of the Anabasis of Xenophon. In 1853 he prefixed a life of Edward Young to a reissue of the Night Thoughts, rewritten in 1854 for Young's complete works. John Doran, portrait engraved by Joseph Brown from a photograph. At the same period Doran began a series of popular works. In 1854 he published Table Traits and Something on Them and Habits and Men, both rich in anecdotes. In 1855 he published in 2 vols. The Queens of the House of Hanover. In 1856 appeared Knights and their Days. In 1857 Doran published, in 2 vols. a historical compilation entitled 'Monarchs retired from Business.' In 1858 he published his History of Court Fools, and edited the Bentley Ballads, which passed through several editions. In 1859 he produced New Pictures and Old Panels. Nearly at the same time he published for the first time from the original manuscripts, in 2 vols., The Last Journals of Horace Walpole. In 1860 appeared Doran's Book of the Princes of Wales, and in 1861 his Memoir of Queen Adelaide. In 1860 Doran published his most elaborate work, Their Majesties' Servants, a history of the English stage, of which a new edition was issued in 1887, revised by Robert W. Lowe. Saints and Sinners, or in the Church and about it, appeared in 1868. In the same year he edited Henry Tuckerman's The Collector, a series of essays on books, newspapers, pictures, inns, authors, doctors, holidays, actors, and preachers. Immediately after the raising of the siege of Paris he brought out A Souvenir of the War of 1870‚Äì1. In 1873 he published A Lady of the Last Century, on Elizabeth Montagu. Three years later he published, in 2 vols. Mann and Manners at the Court of Florence, 1740‚Äì86, based on the letters of Sir Horace Mann to Horace Walpole. Also in 2 vols. was London in the Jacobite Times(1877). Memories of our Great Towns, with Anecdotic Gleanings concerning their Worthies and their Oddities (1878) was a humorous volume. His final publication was produced as a serial contribution to Temple Bar, and published posthumously in 1885 as In and about Drury Lane, a kind of appendix to Their Majesties' Servants. Family On 3 July 1834 he married at Reading Emma, the daughter of Captain Gilbert, R.N., and settled down for a time in Hay-a-Park Cottage, at Knaresborough. He left an only son, Alban Doran, F.R.C.S., and an only daughter, Florence, married to Andreas Holtz of Twyford Abbey, near Ealing.

Biography Douce was born in London. His father was a clerk in Chancery. After completing his education he entered his father's office, but soon quit it to devote himself to the study of antiquities. He became a prominent member of the Society of Antiquaries, and from 1799 to 1811 served as Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum, but was compelled to resign owing to a quarrel with one of the trustees. In 1807 he published his Illustrations of Shakespeare and Ancient Manners (2 vols. 8vo), which contained some curious information, along with a great deal of trifling criticism and mistaken interpretation. An unfavourable notice of the work in The Edinburgh ReviewThe Edinburgh Review, Vol. 14, pp. 449‚Äì68. greatly irritated the author, and made him unwilling to venture any further publications. He contributed, however, a considerable number of papers to the Archaeologia and The Gentleman's Magazine. In 1833 he published a Dissertation on the various Designs of the Dance of Death, the substance of which had appeared forty years before. He died on 30 March 1834. By his will he left his printed books, illuminated manuscripts, coins &c.;, to the Bodleian Library; his own manuscript works to the British Museum, with directions that the chest containing them should not be opened until 1 January 1900; and his paintings, carvings and miscellaneous antiquities to Sir Samuel Meyrick, who published an account of them, entitled The Doucean Museum. Reasons for Resignation In 1811 Douce resigned from the British Museum citing a series of reasons that have become legendary in institutional circles. The letter is preserved in the Bodleian Library.Oxford, Bodleian Library: Bodley MS Douce e. 28. His list of complaints runs as follows: # The Nature of the constitution of the M[useum] altogether objectionable. # The coldness, even danger, in the frequenting the great house in winter. # The vastness of the business remaining to be done & continually flowing in. # The total impossibility of my individual efforts, limited, restrained & controlled as they are, to do any real, or at least much, good. # An apparent, & I believe real, system of espionage throughout the place & certainly a want of due respect towards and confidence in the officers. # The total absence of all aid in my department # [omitted] # [omitted] # The want of society with the members, their habits wholly different & their manners far from fascinating & sometimes repulsive. # The want of power to do any good, & the difficulty to make the motley & often trifling committees sensible that they could do any. # The general pride & affected consequence of these committees. # Their assumption of power, that I think not vested in them. # The fiddle faddle requisition of incessant reports, the greatest part of which can inform them of nothing, or, when they do, of what they are generally incapable of understanding or fairly judging of.

Lindsay founded, with P. R. Stephensen and John Kirtley, the Fanfrolico Press for fine publishing, initially in North Sydney. He left Australia in 1926, never to return. When the University of Queensland Press tried to persuade him to come to Australia for the launch of The Blood Vote in 1985, he declined. In the UK In the 1930s the Fanfrolico Press ceased as a business. Lindsay described that experience later in the autobiographical work Fanfrolico and After (1962). He moved to the left politically, writing for Left Review and joining the Communist Party of Great Britain at the end of the decade, becoming an activist. He started writing novels while living in Cornwall.

The suited man in the centre appears to be Shigetaka Sasaki. The Nikkei Internment Memorial Centre, a National Historic Site of Canada In 1942, internment of Japanese Canadians occurred when over 22,000 Japanese Canadians, comprising over 90 percent of the total Japanese Canadian population, from British Columbia were forcibly relocated and interned in the name of national security. The majority were Canadian citizens by birth. This decision followed the events of the Japanese invasions of British Hong Kong and Malaya, the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and the subsequent Canadian declaration of war on Japan during World War II. This forced relocation subjected many Japanese Canadians to government-enforced curfews and interrogations, job and property losses, and forced repatriation to Japan. Beginning after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and lasting until 1949, Japanese Canadians were stripped of their homes and businesses and sent to internment camps and farms in the B.C. interior and across Canada. The internment and relocation program was funded in part by the sale of property belonging to this forcefully displaced population, which included fishing boats, motor vehicles, houses, and personal belongings. In August 1944, Prime Minister Mackenzie King announced that Japanese Canadians were to be moved east out of the British Columbia interior. The official policy stated that Japanese Canadians must move east of the Rocky Mountains or be repatriated to Japan following the end of the war. By 1947, many Japanese Canadians had been granted exemption to this enforced no-entry zone. Yet it was not until April 1, 1949, that Japanese Canadians were granted freedom of movement and could re-enter the \\"protected zone\\" along B.C.'s coast. On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney delivered an apology, and the Canadian government announced a compensation package, one month after President Ronald Reagan made similar gestures in the United States. The package for interned Japanese Canadians included $21,000 to each surviving internee, and the reinstatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan.Apology and compensation, CBC Archives Following Mulroney's apology, the Japanese Canadian Redress Agreement was established in 1988, along with the Japanese Canadian Redress Foundation (JCRF) (1988-2002), in order to issue redress payments for internment victims, with the intent of funding education. Prewar history =Early settlement= Tension between Canadians and Japanese immigrants to Canada existed long before the outbreak of World War II. Starting as early as 1858 with the influx of Asian immigrants during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, beliefs and fears about Asian immigrants began to affect the populace in British Columbia. Canadian sociologist Forrest La Violette reported in the 1940s that these early sentiments had often been \\"...organized around the fear of an assumed low standard of living [and] out of fear of Oriental cultural and racial differences\\". It was a common prejudiced belief within British Columbia that both Japanese and Chinese immigrants were stealing jobs away from white Canadians. Due to this fear, Canadian academic Charles H. Young concluded that many Canadians argued that \\"Oriental labour lowers the standard of living of White groups\\". It was also argued that Asian immigrants were content with a lower standard of living. The argument was that many Chinese and Japanese immigrants in British Columbia lived in unsanitary conditions and were not inclined to improve their living space, thereby proving their inferiority and their unwillingness to become truly Canadian. Forrest E. La Violette refuted this claim by stating that while Japanese and Chinese immigrants did often have poor living conditions, both of the groups were hindered in their attempt to assimilate due to the difficulty they had in finding steady work at equal wages. In reference to Japanese Canadians specifically, human geographer Audrey Kobayashi argues that prior to the war, racism \\"had defined their communities since the first immigrants arrived in the 1870s.\\" Starting in 1877 with Manzo Nagano, a nineteen-year-old sailor who was the first Japanese person to officially immigrate to Canada, and entering the salmon-exporting business, the Japanese were quick to integrate themselves into Canadian industries. Some Canadians felt that while the Chinese were content with being \\"confined to a few industries\\", the Japanese were infiltrating all areas of industry and competing with white workers. This sense of unease among white Canadians was worsened by the growing rate of Japanese fishermen in the early 1900s. In 1919, 3,267 Japanese immigrants held fishing licences and 50 percent of the total licences issued that year were issued to Japanese fishermen. These numbers were alarming to Canadian fishermen who felt threatened by the growing number of Japanese competitors. Japanese immigrants were also accused of being resistant to assimilation into Canadian society, because of Japanese-language schools, Buddhist temples, and low inter-marriage rates, among other examples. It was asserted that the Japanese had their own manner of living, and that many who had become naturalized in Canada did so to obtain fishing licences rather than out of a desire to become Canadian. These arguments reinforced the idea that the Japanese remained strictly loyal to Japan. =1907 riots= The situation was exacerbated when, in 1907, the United States began prohibiting Japanese immigrants from accessing mainland America through Hawaii, resulting in a massive influx (over 7,000 as compared to 2,042 in 1906) of Japanese immigrants into British Columbia. Largely as a result, on August 12, 1907, a group of Vancouver labourers formed an anti-Asiatic league, known as the Asiatic Exclusion League, with its membership numbering \\"over five hundred\\". On September 7, 1907, some 5,000 people marched on Vancouver City Hall in support of the League, where they had arranged a meeting with presentations from both local and American speakers. By the time of the meeting, it was estimated that at least 25,000 people had arrived at Vancouver City Hall and, following the speakers, the crowd broke out in rioting, marching into Chinatown and Japantown. The rioters stormed through Chinatown first, breaking windows and smashing store fronts.Gilmore, Julie. Trouble on Main Street: Mackenzie King, Reason, Race and the 1907 Riots.Toronto: Allan Lane, 2014, pp. 18. Afterwards, the rioters turned to the Japanese Canadian neighbourhood. Alerted by the previous rioting, Japanese Canadians in Little Tokyo were able to repel the mob without any serious injury or loss of life. After the riot, the League and other nativist groups used their influence to push the government into an arrangement similar to the United States' Gentlemen's Agreement, limiting the number of passports given to male Japanese immigrants to 400 per year. Women were not counted toward the quota, so \\"picture brides,\\" women who married by proxy and immigrated to Canada to join (and in many cases, meet for the first time) their new husbands, became common after 1908. The influx of female immigrants ‚Äì and soon after, Canadian-born children ‚Äì shifted the population from a temporary workforce to a permanent presence, and Japanese-Canadian family groups settled throughout British Columbia and southern Alberta. =World War I= During World War I, opinions of Japanese Canadians improved slightly. They were seen as an ally of the United Kingdom and some Japanese Canadians enlisted in the Canadian Forces. On the home front, many businesses began hiring groups that had been underrepresented in the workforce (including women, Japanese immigrants, and Yugoslavian and Italian refugees who had fled to Canada during the war) to help fill the increasing demands of Britain and its allies overseas. Businesses that had previously been opposed to doing so were now more than happy to hire Japanese Canadians as there was \\"more than enough work for all\\". However, by the end of the war, soldiers returning home to find their jobs filled by others, including Japanese immigrants, were outraged. While they had been fighting in Europe, the Japanese had established themselves securely in many business and were now, more than ever, perceived as a threat to white workers. \\"'Patriotism' and 'Exclusion' became the watchwords of the day.\\" =Interwar years= While groups like the Asiatic Exclusion League and the White Canada Association viewed Japanese Canadians as cultural and economic threats, by the 1920s, other groups had begun to come forward to the defence of Japanese Canadians, such as the Japan Society. In contrast to rival groups' memberships consisting of mostly labourers, farmers, and fishermen, the Japan Society was primarily made up of wealthy white businessmen whose goal was to improve relations between the Japanese and Canadians both at home and abroad. The heads of the organization included a \\"prominent banker of Vancouver\\" and a \\"manager of some of the largest lumbering companies in British Columbia.\\" They saw Japanese Canadians as being important partners in helping to open Japanese markets to businesses in British Columbia. Despite the work of organizations like the Japan Society, many groups still opposed Japanese immigration to Canada, especially in B.C.'s fishing industry during the 1920s and 1930s. Prior to the 1920s, many Japanese labourers were employed as pullers, a job that required them to help the net men row the boats out to fish. The job required no licence, so it was one of the few jobs for first-generation Japanese immigrants who were not Canadian citizens. In 1923, however, the government lifted a ban on the use of motorboats and required that pullers be licensed. This meant that first-generation immigrants, known as , were unable to get jobs in the fishing industry, which resulted in large‚Äìscale unemployment among these . Second-generation Japanese Canadians, known as , and who were born in Canada, began entering the fishing industry at a younger age to compensate for this, but even they were hindered as the increased use of motorboats resulted in less need for pullers and only a small number of fishing licences were issued to Japanese Canadians. This situation escalated in May 1938 when the Governor General abolished the puller licence entirely despite Japanese-Canadian protests. This resulted in many younger Japanese Canadians being forced from the fishing industry, leaving Japanese-Canadian net men to fend for themselves. Later that year, in August, a change to the borders of fishing districts in the area resulted in the loss of licences for several Japanese-Canadian fishermen, who claimed they had not been informed of the change. While these events did result in reduced competition from Japanese Canadians in the fishing industry, it created further tensions elsewhere. Japanese Canadians had already been able to establish a secure position in many businesses during World War I, but their numbers had remained relatively small as many had remained in the fishing industry. As Japanese Canadians began to be pushed out of the fishing industry, they increasingly began to work on farms and in small businesses. This outward move into farming and business was viewed as more evidence of the economic threat Japanese Canadians posed towards white Canadians, leading to increased racial tension. In the years leading up to World War II, approximately 29,000 people of Japanese ancestry lived in British Columbia; 80% of these were Canadian nationals.Summary of Memorandum, Maj. Gen. Maurice Pope, Vice Chief of General Staff (VCGS) to Chief of General Staff (Permanent), 13 January 1942, extracted from HQS 7368, vol. I, Defence Records, 322.009(D358), DND. in The Politics of Racism by Ann Gomer Sunahara At the time, they were denied the right to vote and barred by law from various professions. Racial tensions often stemmed from the belief of many Canadians that all Japanese immigrants, both first- generation and second-generation , remained loyal to Japan alone. Published in Maclean's Magazine, a professor at the University of British Columbia stated that the \\"Japanese in B.C. are as loyal to [Japan] as Japanese anywhere in the world.\\" Other Canadians felt that tensions, in British Columbia specifically, originated from the fact that the Japanese were clustered together almost entirely in and around Vancouver. As a result, as early as 1938, there was talk of encouraging Japanese Canadians to begin moving east of the Rocky Mountains, a proposal that was reified during World War II. The actions of Japan leading up to World War II were also seen as cause for concern. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933, ignored the naval ratio set up by the Washington Naval Conference of 1922, refused to follow the Second London Naval Treaty in 1936, and allied with Germany with the Anti-Comintern Pact. Because many Canadians believed that resident Japanese immigrants would always remain loyal to their home country, the Japanese in British Columbia, even those born and raised in Canada, were often judged for these militant actions taken by their ancestral home. World War II When the Pacific War began, discrimination against Japanese Canadians increased. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japanese Canadians were categorized as enemy aliens under the War Measures Act, which began to remove their personal rights.Fujiwara, Aya. \\"Japanese-Canadian Internally Displaced Persons:Labour Relations and Ethno-Religious Identity in Southern Alberta, 1942‚Äì1953. Page 65 Starting on December 8, 1941, 1,200 Japanese-Canadian-owned fishing vessels were impounded as a \\"defence measure.\\"Sunahara (1981), 28. On January 14, 1942, the federal government issued an order calling for the removal of male Japanese nationals between 18 and 45 years of age from a designated protected area of 100 miles inland from the British Columbia coast. The federal government also enacted a ban against Japanese-Canadian fishing during the war, banned shortwave radios, and controlled the sale of gasoline and dynamite to Japanese Canadians.Sunahara (1981), 37. Japanese nationals removed from the coast after the January 14 order were sent to road camps around Jasper, Alberta. Three weeks later, on February 19, 1942, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which called for the removal of 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry from the American coastline. Anne Sunahara, a historian of internment, argues that \\"the American action sealed the fate of Japanese Canadians.\\"Sunahara (1981), 46. On February 24, the federal government issued order-in-council PC 1486, which allowed for the removal of \\"all persons of Japanese origin.\\"Sugiman, Pamela. \\"Life is Sweet: Vulnerability and Composure in the Wartime Narratives of Japanese Canadians\\". Journals of Canadian Studies. Winter 2009: 186‚Äì218, 262. This order-in-council granted the Minister of Justice the broad powers of removing people from any protected area in Canada, but was meant for Japanese Canadians on the Pacific coast in particular. On February 25, the federal government announced that Japanese Canadians were being moved for reasons of national security.Sunahara, Ann. \\"The Politics of Racism: The Uprooting of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War.\\" Toronto: J, Larimer, 1981.Pg 47‚Äì48. In all, some 27,000 people were detained without charge or trial, and their property confiscated. Others were deported to Japan.Kobayashi, Audrey. \\"The Japanese-Canadian redress settlement and its implications for ‚Äòrace relations‚Äô\\" Canadian Ethnic Studies. Vol. 24, Issue 1. However, not all Canadians believed that Japanese Canadians posed a threat to national security, including select senior officials of the RCMP, Royal Canadian Navy, and Department of Labour and Fisheries.Paolini, David. \\"Japanese Canadian Internment and Racism During World War II\\" The Canadian Studies Undergraduate. 23 March 2010. Notable individuals on the side of the Japanese Canadians included Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, Assistant Under-Secretary at External Affairs during the internment of Japanese Canadians. Anne Sunahara argues that Keenleyside was a sympathetic administrator who advocated strongly against the removal of Japanese Canadians from the BC coast. He unsuccessfully tried to remind other government officials of the distinction between Japanese foreign nationals and Canadian citizens in regards to personal and civil rights.Sunahara (1981), chapter 2. Frederick J. Mead, RCMP Assistant Commissioner, also used his position to advocate for Japanese Canadians and mitigate government actions. Mead was given the task of implementing several federal policies, including the removal of Japanese Canadians from the \\"protected zone\\" along the coast in 1942. Mead attempted to slow down the process, allowing individuals and families more time to prepare by following the exact letter of the law, which required a complicated set of permissions from busy government ministers, rather than the spirit of quick removal it intended.Sunahara (1981), chapter 3. However, it was not just government officials, but also private citizens, who were sympathetic to the Japanese-Canadian cause. Writing his first letter in January 1941, Captain V.C. Best, a Salt Spring Island resident, advocated against mistreatment of Japanese Canadians for over two years.Library and Archives Canada (LAC), RG25, vol. 3037, file 4166-40, letter from Captain V.C. Best to Hugh Keenleyside, 9 January 1941. Best wrote to Keenleyside directly for much of that period, protesting anti-Japanese sentiment in the press, advocating for Japanese-Canadian enlistment in the armed forces, and, when the forced removal and internment of Japanese Canadians was underway, the conditions Japanese Canadians faced in internment camps.LAC, RG25, vol. 3037, file 4166-40, letter from Captain V.C. Best to Hugh Keenleyside, 2 February 1941. LAC, RG25, vol. 3037, file 4166-40, letter from Captain V.C. Best to Hugh Keenleyside, 13 January 1942. LAC, RG25, vol. 3037, file 4166-40, letter from Captain V.C. Best to Hugh Keenleyside, 7 February 1943. =Mackenzie King= William Lyon Mackenzie King served his final term as Prime Minister between 1935 and 1948, at which point he retired from Canadian politics. He had served two previous terms as Prime Minister, but this period was perhaps his most well-known. His policies during this period included unemployment insurance and tariff agreements with the UK and the United States. Prime Minister King wrote in his diary daily for most of his life. These diary entries have provided historians with a sense of the thoughts and feelings King held during the war. Historian N.F. Dreisziger has written that \\"though he undoubtedly considered himself a man of humanitarian outlook, he was a product of his times and shared the values of his fellow Canadians. He was‚Äîbeyond doubt‚Äîan anti-Semite, and shouldered, more than any of his Cabinet colleagues, the responsibility of keeping Jewish refugees out of the country on the eve of and during the war.\\"Dreisziger, N F. \\"7 December 1941: A turning point in Canadian wartime policy toward enemy ethnic groups?\\" Journal of Canadian Studies. Spring 1997: 93‚Äì11 Prior to the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan, Prime Minister King was not considered a racist. He seemed concerned for humanity and was against the use of the atomic bomb and even its creation. When King learned of the estimated date of the bomb dropping, he wrote in his diary: \\"It makes one very sad at heart to think of the loss of life that it [the bomb] will occasion among innocent people as well as those that are guilty\\".Johnson, Gregory A. \\"An Apocalyptic Moment: Mackenzie King and the Bomb\\". Pg 103 Historians, however, point to King's specific diary entry on August 6, 1945, when referring to King's racism toward the Japanese. On August 6, King wrote in his diary: :\\"It is fortunate that the use of the bomb should have been upon the Japanese rather than upon the white races of Europe\\".King Diary, 6 August 1945. =Japanese Canadians serving in the war= For many Japanese Canadians, World War I provided an opportunity to prove their loyalty to Canada and their allies through military service in the hopes of gaining previously denied citizenship rights. In the early years of the war, however, the supply of enlisting men surpassed demand, so recruiting officers could be selective in who they accepted. However, large numbers of Japanese Canadians volunteered, as did members of other visible minorities like Black Canadians and First Nations, so the Canadian government proposed a compromise that, if enlisted, minorities could fight separately. The Japanese Canadian community was very energetic on this front. The Canadian Japanese Association of Vancouver offered to raise a battalion in 1915 and, upon receiving a polite reply, proceeded to enlist and train 277 volunteers at the expense of the Japanese Canadian community.Walker (1989), 7. This offer, however, was rejected by Prime Minister Robert Borden and his federal cabinet. Yet, by the summer of 1916, the death toll in the trenches had risen, creating a new demand for soldiers and an increased need for domestic labour, which meant that the recruitment of minorities was reconsidered. Under this new policy, Japanese Canadians were able to enlist individually by travelling elsewhere in Canada where their presence was deemed less of a threat. By the end of World War I, 185 Japanese Canadians served overseas in 11 different battalions.Walker (1989), 12. During World War II, some of the interned Japanese Canadians were combat veterans of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, including several men who had been decorated for bravery on the Western Front. Despite the first iterations of veterans affairs associations established during World War II, fear and racism drove policy and trumped veterans' rights, meaning that virtually no Japanese-Canadian veterans were exempt from being removed from the BC coast. Small numbers of military-age Japanese- Canadian men were permitted to serve in the Canadian Army in the Second World War as interpreters and in signal/intelligence units.\\"Will Register B.C Japanese to Eliminate Illegal Entrants,\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto: January 9, 1941) By January 1945, several Japanese Canadian men were attached to British units in the Far East as interpreters and translators. In total, about 200 Canadian joined Canadian forces during World War II. Throughout the war, Canadians of \\"Oriental racial origin\\" were not called upon to perform compulsory military service. Japanese Canadian men who had chosen to serve in the Canadian army during the war to prove their allegiance to Canada were discharged only to discover they were unable to return to the BC coast, or unable to have their rights reinstated. Internment camps The December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor spurred prominent British Columbians, including members of municipal governments, local newspapers, and businesses to call for the internment of ethnic Japanese living in Canada under the Defence of Canada Regulations. In British Columbia, there were fears that some Japanese Canadians who worked in the fishing industry were charting the coastline for the Japanese Navy and spying on Canada's military. British Columbia borders the Pacific Ocean, and was therefore believed to be easily susceptible to enemy attacks from Japan. In total, 22,000 Japanese Canadians (14,000 of whom were born in Canada) were interned starting in 1942. Even though both the RCMP and the Department of National Defence lacked proof of any sabotage or espionage, Prime Minister Mackenzie King decided to intern Japanese Canadians based on speculative evidence. Widespread internment began on February 24, 1942, with an order-in-council passed under the Defence of Canada Regulations of the War Measures Act, which gave the federal government the power to intern all \\"persons of Japanese racial origin.\\"Wild Daisies in the Sand: Life in a Canadian Internment Camp, Tsuneharu Gonnami, Pacific Affairs, Winter 2003/2004. A wide strip along the Pacific coast was deemed \\"protected\\", and men of Japanese origin between the ages of 18 and 45 were removed. =Sugar beet farms, road work, and prisoner-of-war camps= Japanese Canadian evacuation Hastings Park - kindergarten Many of the Japanese nationals removed from the coast after January 14, 1942, were sent to road camps in the British Columbia interior or sugar beet projects on the Prairies, such as in Taber, Alberta. Despite the 100-mile quarantine, a few Japanese-Canadian men remained in McGillivray Falls, which was just outside the protected zone. However, they were employed at a logging operation at Devine (near D'Arcy in the Gates Valley), which was in the protected zone but without road access to the coast. Japanese-Canadians interned in Lillooet Country found employment within farms, stores, and the railway.My Sixty Years in Canada, Dr. Masajiro Miyazaki, self- publ. The Liberal government also deported able-bodied Japanese-Canadian labourers to camps near fields and orchards, such as the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. The Japanese-Canadian labourers were used as a solution to a shortage of farm workers.\\"Propose Japs Work in Orchards of B.C,\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto: January 16, 1942) This obliterated any Japanese competition in the fishing sector. During the 1940s, the Canadian government created policies to direct Chinese, Japanese, and First Nations into farming, and other sectors of the economy that \\"other groups were abandoning for more lucrative employment elsewhere\\".Carmela Patrias, \\"Race, Employment Discrimination, and State Complicity in Wartime Canada, 1939‚Äì1945,\\" Labour no. 59 (April 1, 2007), 32. The forced removal of many Japanese-Canadian men to become labourers elsewhere in Canada created confusion and panic among families, causing some men to refuse orders to ship out to labour camps. On March 23, 1942, a group of Nisei refused to be shipped out and so were sent to prisoner-of-war camps in Ontario to be detained.Sunahara (1981), 66. The Nisei Mass Evacuation Group was formed to protest family break-ups and lobbied government organizations on the topic. However, their attempts were ignored and members of the group began going underground, preferring to be interned or sent to Ontario rather than join labour groups.Sunahara (1981), 68. By July 1942, after strikes occurred within the labour camps themselves, the federal government made a policy to keep families together in their removal to internment camps in the BC interior or sugar beet farms across the prairies.Sunahara (1981), 74‚Äì75. =\\"Self- supporting projects\\"= In early March, all ethnic Japanese people were ordered out of the protected area, and a daytime-only curfew was imposed on them. Various camps in the Lillooet area and in Christina Lake were formally \\"self-supporting projects\\" (also called \\"relocation centres\\") which housed selected middle- and upper-class families and others not deemed as much of a threat to public safety.Explanation of different categories of internment, Nat'l Assn. of Japanese Canadians website Map of Internment Centres in BC, Nat'l Assn. of Japanese Canadians website =Internment camps= Before being sent off to road camps, sugar beet farms, or prisoner-of-war camps, many Japanese-Canadian men and their families were processed through Hastings Park in Vancouver, BC. Many of the men were separated from their families and sent into the B.C. interior or across Canada, but most women and children stayed in the park until they were sent to internment camps in the interior or decided as a family to join the sugar beet farms in the prairies.Sunahara (1981), 55, 78. =Effects of internment camps on women and children= Japanese-Canadian women and children faced a specific set of challenges that greatly affected their way of life and broke down the social and cultural norms that had developed. Whole families were taken from their homes and separated from each other. Husbands and wives were almost always separated when sent to camps and, less commonly, some mothers were separated from their children as well. Japanese-Canadian families typically had a patriarchal structure, meaning the husband was the centre of the family. Since husbands were often separated from their families, wives were left to reconfigure the structure of the family and the long-established divisions of labour that were so common in the Japanese- Canadian household.Oikawa, Mona. Cartographies of Violence: Japanese Canadian Women, Memory, and the Subjects of the Internment. Toronto: U of Toronto, 2012. Print. Life after internment Oftentimes after internment, families could not be reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community led to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese with outside the home and as a result they rarely learned the language fluently. This fracturing of community also led to a lack of Japanese cultural foundation and many children lost a strong connection with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to teach their children about Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.Henderson, Jennifer, and Pauline Wakeham. Reconciling Canada: Critical Perspectives on the Culture of Redress. Toronto: U of Toronto, 2013. Print =Camp conditions= Internment camp, June 1944, upper part of British Columbia (Canada) A road crew of interned men building the Yellowhead Highway Many Canadians were unaware of the living conditions in the internment camps. The Japanese Canadians who resided within the camp at Hastings Park were placed in stables and barnyards, where they lived without privacy in an unsanitary environment. Kimiko, a former internee, attested to the \\"intense cold during the winter\\" and her only source of heat was from a \\"pot-bellied stove\\" within the stable. General conditions were poor enough that the Red Cross transferred fundamental food shipments from civilians affected by the war to the internees.Japanese Canadian Internment , University of Washington Libraries Some internees spoke out against their conditions, often complaining to the British Columbia Security Commission directly whenever possible. In one incident, fifteen men who had been separated from their families and put to work in Slocan Valley protested by refusing to work for four days straight. Despite attempts at negotiation, the men were eventually informed that they would be sent to the Immigration Building jail in Vancouver for their refusal to work. Their mistreatment caused several of the men to begin hoping that Japan would win the war and force Canada to compensate them. Tashme, a camp on Highway 3 just east of Hope, was notorious for the camp's harsh conditions and existed just outside the protected area. Other internment camps, including Slocan, were in the Kootenay Country in southeastern British Columbia.The Dewdney Trail, 1987, Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd. Leadership positions within the camps were only offered to , or Canadian-born citizens of Japanese origin, thereby excluding , the original immigrants from Japan. The internment camps in the B.C. interior were often ghost towns with little infrastructure to support the influx of people. When Japanese Canadians began arriving in the summer and fall of 1942, any accommodations given were shared between multiple families and many had to live in tents while shacks were constructed in the summer of 1942. The shacks were small and built with damp, green wood. When winter came, the wood made everything damp and the lack of insulation meant that the inside of the shacks often froze during the night.Sunahara (1981), chapter 4. Very little was provided for the internees ‚Äì green wood to build accommodation and a stove was all that most received. Men could make some money in construction work to support their families, but women had very few opportunities. Yet, finding work was almost essential since interned Japanese Canadians had to support themselves and buy food using the small salaries they had collected or through allowances from the government for the unemployed. The relief rates were so low that many families had to use their personal savings to live in the camps. By the spring of 1943, however, some conditions began to change as Japanese Canadians in the camp organized themselves. Removal from the coast to ghost towns had been done based on location, so many communities moved together and were placed in same camp together. This preserved local communal ties and facilitated organizing and negotiating for better conditions in the camp. =Camp locations= *Camps and relocation centres in the Kootenay region of British Columbia **Bay Farm **Greenwood **Kaslo **Lemon Creek **New Denver **Popoff **Rosebery **Sandon **Slocan City *Camps and relocation centres elsewhere in British Columbia **Bridge River (South Shalalth) **McGillivray Falls **Minto City **East Lillooet **Sunshine Valley **Tashme *Camps and relocation centres elsewhere in Canada **Kananaskis, Alberta **Chatham, Ontario **Petawawa, Ontario **Schreiber, Ontario **Cheese Island, Ontario **St. Thomas, Ontario **Toronto, Ontario **Hull, Quebec **Minto, New Brunswick **Amherst, Nova Scotia Restriction of property rights Those living in \\"relocation camps\\" were not legally interned‚Äîthey could leave, so long as they had permission‚Äîhowever, they were not legally allowed to work or attend school outside the camps. Since the majority of Japanese Canadians had little property aside from their (confiscated) houses, these restrictions left most with no opportunity to survive outside the camps. It was the hope of the Canadian government that selling all of the Japanese Canadians' personal possessions and property would deter them from returning to British Columbia.Sunahara (1981), 101. Prime Minister King issued a ruling that all property would be removed from Japanese Canadian inhabitants. They were made to believe that their property would be held in trust until they had resettled elsewhere in Canada. Dispossession began with the seizure and forced sale of Japanese-Canadian fishing vessels in December 1941. After their seizure, the boats sat in disrepair for several months before being sold by the \\"Japanese Fishing Vessel Disposal Committee\\" at below-market prices.Sunahara (1981), 102. With this precedent set, B.C. politician Ian Mackenzie, federal Minister of Pensions and Health, wanted to ensure that Japanese Canadians never returned home and achieved this by selling Japanese Canadian farms and property as cheaply as possible. In his mind, this would stop Japanese Canadians from returning to the coast after the war and would provide farms for the Veterans Land Act program, a program to resettle World War II veterans after the war.Sunahara (1981), 103. In 1943, the Canadian \\"Custodian of Enemy Property\\" liquidated all possessions belonging to the 'enemy aliens'. The Custodian of Enemy Property held auctions for these items, ranging from farm land, homes, and clothing. Japanese Canadians lost their fishing boats, bank deposits, stocks, and bonds; all items that had provided them with financial security.Forrest E. LaViolette, \\"Japanese Evacuation in Canada,\\" Far Eastern Survey, Vol. 11, No. 15 (Institute of Pacific Relations, 1942),165. Japanese Canadians protested that their property was sold at prices far below the fair market value at the time.\\"Jap Expropriation Hearing May Last 3 Years, Is Estimate,\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto: January 12, 1948) Prime Minister King responded to the objections by stating that the \\"Government is of the opinion that the sales were made at a fair price.\\"\\"Retreat Under Pressure,\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto: January 27, 1947) In all, 7,068 pieces of property, personal and landholdings alike, were sold for a total of $2,591,456. As well, robberies against businesses in Japantown rose after Pearl Harbor was bombed. At least one person died during a botched robbery.Merciful Injustice, Facebook page of Merciful Injustice documentaryVancouver Sun series Merciful Injustice A Royal Canadian Navy officer questions Japanese-Canadian fishermen while confiscating their boat. Confinement in the internment camps transformed the citizenship of many Japanese Canadians into an empty status and revoked their right to work. =Fishing boats= There were some economic benefits that came with the internment of Japanese Canadians. Specifically, white fishermen directly benefited due to the impounding of all Japanese-Canadian-owned fishing boats. Fishing for salmon was a hotly contested issue between the white Canadians and Japanese Canadians. In 1919, Japanese Canadians received four thousand and six hundred of the salmon-gill net licences, representing roughly half of all of the licences the government had to distribute. In a very public move on behalf of the Department of Fisheries in British Columbia, it was recommended that in the future Japanese Canadians should never again receive more fishing licences than they had in 1919 and also that every year thereafter that number be reduced. These were measures taken on behalf of the provincial government to oust the Japanese from salmon fishing. The federal government also got involved in 1926, when the House of Commons‚Äô Standing Committee on Fisheries put forward suggestions that the number of fishing licences issued to Japanese Canadians be reduced by ten percent a year, until they were entirely removed from the industry by 1937. Yet, the reason the government gave for impounding the few remaining and operating Japanese-Canadian fishing boats was that the government feared these boats would be used by Japan to mount a coastal attack on British Columbia. Many boats belonging to Japanese Canadians were damaged, and over one hundred sank.Establishing Recognition of Past Injustices: Uses of Archival Records in Documenting the Experience of Japanese Canadians During the Second World War. Roberts-Moore, Judith. Archivaria: The Journal of the Association of Canadian Archivists, 53 (2002). A few properties owned by Japanese Canadians in Richmond and Vancouver were vandalized, including the Steveston Buddhist Temple. =Other property= The dispossession and liquidation of Japanese-Canadian property began in April 1942, when Ian Mackenzie asked the head of the Soldier Settlement Board, Thomas A. Crerar, and administrative head Gordon Murchison, to look into taking over Japanese Canadian farms for the Veteran's Land Act program, which was not yet put into law. They undertook a survey of the farms, but their survey metrics were flawed. They used measures from the Depression Era, when property values were low, did not take into account current crops or other land uses, and discounted the value of buildings by 70%. In June 1942, Order in Council PC 5523 authorized Crerar to buy or lease Japanese Canadian farms without consulting their owners. Because of this, 572 farms were sold for $841,225, substantially less than their assessed value of $1,239,907.Adachi (1976), 320. What started with the sale of farms soon expanded to include the sale of residential properties. In November 1942, the Custodian of Enemy Property, which already controlled most Japanese-Canadian property, began hinting towards obtaining the right to sell the property, not just administer it. This idea was well received by the Department of Labour, who were unsure how to pay for Japanese Canadian internment; selling their property would help Japanese Canadians pay for their own detention.Sunahara (1981), 104. Separately, the City of Vancouver also pushed for the sale of Japanese Canadian properties in the Powell Street \\"ghetto\\" to allow for redevelopment in the area. What began with discussions in the summer of 1942 about city-level urban renewal was quickly co-opted by the federal government in an attempt to sell all Japanese- Canadian properties, far beyond what the City of Vancouver had initially suggested.Sunahara (1981), 105. On January 11, 1943, the Cabinet Committee on Japanese Problems recommended the sale of urban and rural Japanese-Canadian properties, arguing that it would be safeguarding them and that it would be in the Japanese-Canadian owners‚Äô best interest to sell because the value of their properties would go down.Roy, Patricia. The Triumph of Citizenship: The Japanese and Chinese in Canada, 1941‚Äì67. Vancouver: UBC Press, 2007, 116. On January 23, 1943, an Order in Council was passed by the federal government that gave the Custodian of Enemy Property the right to sell Japanese Canadian property without the owner's consent, and by March 1943, the full dispossession of all property began.Sunahara (1981), 105‚Äì106. Japanese Canadians tried to resist the forced sale of their properties. At an internment camp in Kaslo, BC, Japanese Canadian property owners formed the \\"Japanese Property Owners‚Äô Association\\" with branches at other internment camps across B.C.Sunahara (1981), 107. Their aim was to explore the possibilities for legal action, and in May 1944 they launched a claim with the Exchequer Court in Ottawa.Adachi (1976), 322. The claim was delayed in courts until August 28, 1947, and in the meantime, approximately $11.5 million worth of Japanese Canadian property had been sold for just over $5 million.Sunahara (1981), 110. For those Japanese Canadians living in the internment camps, the forced sale of their properties meant they now had less money and resources. They were not receiving any rental income from their properties, and the Custodian of Enemy Property took control of the funds resulting from property sales. The Custodian did not provide interest on the funds, and restricted withdrawals from the funds held in their possession. What little funds Japanese Canadians were able to receive went to supporting themselves and their families in the camps, often helping those who could not work or were not able to live off inadequate government subsidies. As a result, many families and single men began leaving B.C. in search of employment elsewhere.Sunahara (1981), 111. =Bird Commission= In 1946 and 1947, pressure began to build for the federal government to address the forced sale of Japanese-Canadian property. In 1947, representatives from the Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians and the Japanese Canadian Committee for Democracy asked the federal government's Public Accounts Committee to launch a Royal Commission to look into the losses associated with the forced sales. In June 1947, the Public Accounts Committee recommended that a commission be struck to examine the claims of Japanese Canadians living in Canada for losses resulting from receiving less than the fair market value of their property.Adachi (1976), 325. A Royal Commission was set up later that year, headed by Justice Henry Bird, with terms of reference that placed the onus on the Japanese-Canadian claimant to prove that the Custodian of Enemy Property was negligent in the handling of their property. The terms of reference soon expanded to also include the sale of the property below market value, but no cases were accepted that dealt with issues outside the control of the Custodian of Enemy Property.Adachi (1976), 325‚Äì326. In late 1947, Bird began to hear individual claims, but by 1948 it became clear to the commission that the magnitude of claims and amount of property in dispute could take years to settle and become very expensive for claimants because of legal fees. Thus, in the spring of 1949, the Bird Commission adopted a category formula that set out certain reimbursement percentages for each category of claim, except for unusual circumstances.Adachi (1976), 327. The commission concluded in 1950, and the report stated that:Adachi (1976), 329‚Äì331. *The commission found that claims relating to fishing boats should receive 12.5% of the sale price as compensation and receive the Custodian of Enemy Property's 13.5% commission. Out of the 950 fishing boats seized in 1941, only 75 claims were processed by the Bird Commission. *Claims relating to fishing nets and gear should receive 25% of the sale price. *Claims relating to cars and trucks should receive 25% of the sale price. *Claims relating to the sale of personal belongings were deemed mostly worthless and claimants received the Custodian of Enemy Property's commission plus 6.8% of the sale price. *Very few claims relating to personal real estate received any form of compensation because the Commission concluded that most were sold for fair market value. *Farmers whose property had been seized by the Soldier Settlement Board received $632,226.61 combined, despite that being only half of their total claim. The top monetary award was $69,950 against a $268,675 claim by the Royston Lumber Company, and the smallest claim was $2.50 awarded to Ishina Makino for a claim against a car.Adachi (1976), 321. After the report was released, the CCJC and National Japanese Canadian Citizens‚Äô Association wanted to push for further compensation, however, when claimants accepted their Bird Commission reimbursements, they had to sign a form agreeing that they would not press any further claims.Adachi (1976), 332. By 1950, the Bird Commission awarded $1.3 million in claims to 1,434 Japanese Canadians. However, it only accepted claims based on loss of property, refusing to compensate for wrongdoing in terms of civil rights, damages due to loss of earnings, disruption of education, or other factors. The issue of Japanese Canadian losses was not revisited in-depth until the Price Waterhouse study in 1986. Resettlement and repatriation British Columbian politicians began pushing for the permanent removal of Japanese Canadians in 1944. By December, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt had announced that Japanese Americans would soon be allowed to return to the West Coast, and pressure to publicize Canada's plans for their interned Japanese Canadians was high. Officials created a questionnaire to distinguish \\"loyal\\" from \\"disloyal\\" Japanese Canadians and gave internees the choice to move east of the Rockies immediately or be \\"repatriated\\" to Japan at the end of the war. Some 10,000 Japanese Canadians, unable to move on short notice or simply hesitant to remain in Canada after their wartime experiences, chose deportation. The rest opted to move east, many to the city of Toronto, where they could take part in agricultural work. By 1947, most Japanese Canadians not slated for deportation had moved from British Columbia to the Toronto area, where they often become farmhands or took on similar labour jobs as they had done before.Uprooted Citizens Living New Lives, Seem Contented in Toronto Area,\\" Globe and Mail (Toronto: September 20, 1947) Several Japanese Canadians who resettled in the east wrote letters back to those still in British Columbia about the harsh labour conditions in the fields of Ontario and the prejudiced attitudes they would encounter.Carmela Patrias, \\"Race, Employment Discrimination, and State Complicity in Wartime Canada,\\" 36. White-collar jobs were not open to them, and most Japanese Canadians were reduced to \\"wage-earners\\". When news of Japan's surrender in August 1945 reached the internment camps, thousands balked at the idea of resettling in the war-torn country and attempted to revoke their applications for repatriation. All such requests were denied, and deportation to Japan began in May 1946. While the government offered free passage to those who were willing to be deported to Japan, thousands of born in Canada were being sent to a country they had never known. Families were divided, and being deported to a country that had been destroyed by bombs and was now hunger-stricken due to the war. Public attitudes towards the internees had softened somewhat since the start of the war, and citizens formed the Cooperative Committee on Japanese Canadians to protest the forced deportation. The government relented in 1947 and allowed those still in the country to remain; however, by this time 3,964 Japanese Canadians had already been deported to Japan. Postwar history Following public protest, the order-in-council that authorized the forced deportation was challenged on the basis that the forced deportation of Japanese Canadians was a crime against humanity and that a citizen could not be deported from his or her own country. The federal cabinet referred the constitutionality of the order-in-council to the Supreme Court of Canada for its opinion. In a five to two decision, the Court held that the law was valid. Three of the five found that the order was entirely valid. The other two found that the provision including both women and children as threats to national security was invalid. The matter was then appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, at that time the court of last resort for Canada. The Judicial Committee upheld the decision of the Supreme Court. In 1947, due to various protests among politicians and academics, the federal cabinet revoked the legislation to repatriate the remaining Japanese Canadians to Japan. It was only in April 1949 that all restrictions were lifted from Japanese Canadians. Issues surrounding the internment of Japanese Canadians also led to changes to Canadian immigration policy, with the legislation gaining momentum after a statement made by the Prime Minister on May 1, 1947: This reform to immigration policy was deemed necessary on two grounds: the inevitable post-war crisis of displaced persons from Europe, and the growing number of Canadians who wished to bring family to Canada following the war‚Äîthe large number of war brides being the chief concern on this front. Mackenzie King believed that Canada was under no legal obligations to make such accommodations, only a moral obligation. During this time, the Canadian government also made provisions to begin the repeal of the discriminatory Chinese Immigration Act. Notable individuals interned Redress In the postwar years, Japanese Canadians had organized the Japanese Canadian Committee for Democracy, which later became the National Association of Japanese Canadians (NAJC). In 1977, during the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the arrival of the first Japanese immigrant to Canada, discussions of redress began to have an effect. Meeting in basements and coffee houses, Japanese Canadian anger arose again, and the sense of shame was gradually replaced by one of indignation. This encouraged Japanese Canadians to fight for their rights and to gain compensation for what they had been through during the war. In 1983, the NAJC mounted a major campaign for redress which demanded, among other things, a formal government apology, individual compensation, and the abolition of the War Measures Act. To help their case, the NAJC hired Price Waterhouse to examine records to estimate the economic losses to Japanese Canadians resulting from property confiscations and loss of wages due to internment. Statisticians consulted the detailed records of Custodian of Enemy Property, and in their 1986 report, valued the total loss to Japanese Canadians at $443 million (in 1986 dollars). On September 22, 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney delivered an apology, and the Canadian government announced a compensation package, one month after President Ronald Reagan made similar gestures in the United States. The package for interned Japanese Canadians included $21,000 to each surviving internee, and the re- instatement of Canadian citizenship to those who were deported to Japan. Following Mulroney's apology, the Japanese Canadian Redress Agreement was established in 1988, along with the Japanese Canadian Redress Foundation (JCRF) (1988-2002), in order to issue redress payments for internment victims, with the intent of funding education. However, of the $12 million community fund, it was agreed upon by the JCRF board members that $8 million would go towards building homes and service centres for Issei senior citizens. Due to the fact that Issei had been stripped of their wealth, property, and livelihoods during internment, it was a main concern of the JCRF to provide aid to their community elders. Nothing was given for those that had been interned and died before compensation was paid out. Following redress, there was increased education in the public education system about internment. By utilizing this outlet, Canadians were able to confront the social injustice of Japanese Internment in a way that accepts those affected and aids in creating a community that values social reconstruction, equality, and fair treatment. Public education provides an outlet for wronged individuals to share their stories and begin to heal, which is a necessary process to repair their trust in a government that can care for and protect their individual and cultural rights. \\"The first step to recognition of Japanese-Canadian redress as an issue for all Canadians was recognition that it was an issue for all Japanese Canadians, not in the interests of retribution for their 'race', nor only in the interests of justice, but in recognition of a need to assert principles of human rights so that racism and other forms of discrimination might be challenged.\\" The question of whether Canada and Japanese Canadians can truly move on from the past has been explored in first-hand accounts and literature, such as Joy Kogawa's Obasan. The Nikkei Memorial Internment Centre in New Denver, British Columbia, is an interpretive centre that honours the history of interned Japanese Canadians, many of whom were confined nearby. Cultural references The internment of Japanese Canadians is the subject matter of the folk song ‚ÄúKiri‚Äòs Piano‚Äù on the album My Skies by James Keelaghan. Writer Joy Kogawa is the most famous and culturally prominent chronicler of the internment of Japanese Canadians, having written about the period in works including the novels Obasan and Itsuka, and the augmented reality application East of the Rockies.Samantha Edwards, \\"Joy Kogawa revisits Canada‚Äôs dark wartime past in new AR app\\".

Rice, 275 U.S. 78 (1927), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the exclusion on account of race of a child of Chinese ancestry from a state high school did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision effectively approved the exclusion of minority children from schools reserved for whites.Bot generated title --> Background In 1924, a nine-year-old Chinese-American named Martha Lum, daughter of Gong Lum, was prohibited from attending the Rosedale Consolidated High School of the Rosedale Consolidated School District in Bolivar County, Mississippi solely because she was of Chinese descent.Chapter 10: Gong Lum et al. v. Rice et al. (1927). In: Tong, Benson (editor). Asian American Children: A Historical Handbook and Guide. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. , 9780313330421. p. 182. There was no school in the district maintained for Chinese students, and she was forced by compulsory attendance laws to attend school. A lower court granted the plaintiff's request of a writ of mandamus to force the members of the Board of Trustees to admit Martha Lum. Gong Lum's case was not that racial discrimination as such was illegal but that his daughter, being Chinese, had incorrectly been classified as colored by the authorities. Since the ruling went against them, the Board of Trustees became the plaintiff, and Lum was named the defendant in the case Rice v. Gong Lum, which was heard in the Supreme Court of Mississippi. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision and allowed the Board of Trustees to exclude Martha Lum from the school for white children. Gong Lum appealed the state Supreme Court's ruling to the US Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's decision In an opinion written by Chief Justice William Howard Taft, the US Supreme Court affirmed the Mississippi Supreme Court's ruling and thus the position of the Board of Trustees. In the unanimous opinion, Taft held that the petitioner had not shown that there were no segregated schools accessible for the education of Martha Lum in Mississippi: > We must assume, then, that there are school districts for colored children > in Bolivar county, but that no colored school is within the limits of the > Rosedale consolidated high school district. This is not inconsistent with > there being at a place outside of that district and in a different district, > a colored school which the plaintiff Martha Lum may conveniently attend. Taft further stated that given the accessibility of segregated schools, the question then was whether a person of Chinese ancestry, born in and a citizen of the United States, was denied equal protection of the law by being given the opportunity to attend a school that received \\"only children of the brown, yellow or black races.\\" In reference to Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education, Taft concluded that the \\"right and power of the state to regulate the method of providing for the education of its youth at public expense is clear.\\" Additionally, Taft pointed to a number of federal and state court decisions, most prominently Plessy v. Ferguson, all of which had upheld segregation in the public sphere and particularly in the realm of public education. Accordingly, Taft concluded: > Most of the cases cited arose, it is true, over the establishment of > separate schools as between white pupils and black pupils; but we cannot > think that the question is any different, or that any different result can > be reached, assuming the cases above cited to be rightly decided, where the > issue is as between white pupils and the pupils of the yellow races. The > decision is within the discretion of the state in regulating its public > schools, and does not conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court was affirmed. Martha Lum was not allowed to go to the school for white children. Subsequent developments Lum was effectively overruled by the Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which outlawed segregation in public schools. However, an important part of the decision still stands. The power of the state to make racial distinctions in its school system, and to determine the race of its students, has not been overturned because it was not an issue in Brown v. Board of Education.347 U.S. 483Rawles, Lee. (Host). (2017, May 17).How a Chinese American Family Challenged School Segregation in 1920s Mississippi. ABA Journal: Modern Law Library [Audio podcast].

Other services offered by WoW include contraception, individual reproductive counseling, workshops, and education about unwanted pregnancy. Workshops are conducted for lawyers, doctors, artists, writers, public health care activists, as well as for women and men to learn about contraceptive practices and non-surgical, DIY abortion using RU-486.Whitten, Diana. 2014. Vessel. Documentary film. Published by Sovereignty Productions. Services are provided on a commissioned ship that contains a specially constructed mobile clinic, the A-Portable. When WoW visits a country, women make appointments, and are taken on board the ship. The ship then sails out approximately 20 km (12 miles), to international waters, where Dutch laws are in effect on board ships registered in the Netherlands. Once in international waters, the ship's medical personnel provide a range of reproductive health services that includes medical abortion. The A-Portable was designed by Dutch artist and sculptor Atelier van Lieshout and functions as both medical clinic and art installation. Women on Waves volunteers and personnel have been targeted by governmental authorities, religious organizations, and local groups who are opposed to abortion and/or contraception. The NGO is credited for reviving debates about abortion in the countries where Women on Waves visits. Rebecca Gomperts Rebecca Gomperts, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, 2017 Rebecca Gomperts is a physician in general practice, artist and women's rights activist. Born in 1966, Gomperts grew up in the port town of Vlissingen, the Netherlands. She moved to Amsterdam in the 1980s where she studied art and medicine simultaneously. Drawing on her experiences as a resident physician on the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior II, which was captained by Bart J. Terwiel, Gomperts created WoW in order to address the health issues created by illegal abortion. While visiting Latin America on board the Rainbow Warrior II, the organization was inspired by a desire to further facilitate social change and women's health. In some developing countries, as many as 800 illegal, unsafe abortions are performed daily, in contrast to some developed nations, such as the Netherlands, where residents have access to safe, legal, medical abortions and contraception.The Outlaw Ocean Project, \\"Mexico: Abortion on the High Seas\\" VIDEO, 2019. In collaboration with Atelier van Lieshout, she designed a portable gynaecology unit called \\"A-portable\\" that can be installed on chartered ships. The stated goals of the organization are to raise awareness and stimulate discussion about laws regarding abortion which they allege to be restrictive, as well as to provide safe, non-surgical abortions for women who live in countries where abortion is illegal.  The A-Portable  The mobile gynecological clinic was designed and named by Dutch artist and sculptor Atelier van Lieshout. Known as the A-Portable, the clinic is in a retrofitted shipping container. It is painted a light blue color with the Women on Waves logo painted on the sides. To travel, the shipping container is strapped onto ships registered in the Netherlands, and rented by Women on Waves, which is a nongovernmental organization (NGO). Lambert-Beatty describes the logo, which was designed by Kees Ryter in 2001: [the clinic's) \\"side is emblazoned with a purple spot on which, in turn, floats an orange shape outlined in pink: a squared cross, one quickly realizes, of the kind that symbolizes humanitarian and medical aid.\\" p. 309 The clinic is a fully functional gynecological clinic offering contraceptive counseling, sonograms, and medical and surgery abortions. It is generally staffed with two physicians and a nurse. Trained volunteers also staff the ship to provide education and counseling. The ship's crew is nearly all female. In ports in countries that allow it, the ship's staff provide workshops on legal and medical issues. During visits to countries with restrictive laws, the ship travels into international waters, usually about 12 miles from land, in order to provide services. The A-Portable functions as a medical clinic, but is also considered to be a work of art. The original funds to create the A-Portable were awarded by the Mondriaan Foundation, which is a Dutch \\"publicly financed fund for visual art and cultural heritage.\\" It appeared in Portugal at the Ute Meta Bauer's Women Building Exhibition; in Amsterdam at the Mediamatic art space; and in Artforum. Lambert-Beatty notes that Claire Bishop, an art historian, critic, and professor of art, interprets the A-Portable as \\"new political art.\\" Voyages In 2002, after contentious debate in the Dutch parliament, Holland's Minister of Health, Els Borst, gave permission to medical personnel on board the Women on Waves ship to offer pregnant women RU-486, known colloquially as the abortion pill, on board their boat, Aurora. According to Borst, the decision was in line with the Dutch government's policy on the issue of sexual independence of women. The permission was given on the condition that the abortion pill would only be used to terminate pregnancies of up to nine weeks and would be provided in the presence of a gynaecologist. =Ireland= Women on Waves made its maiden voyage aboard the Aurora to Ireland in 2001. The ship carried two Dutch doctors and one Dutch nurse. The stated purpose of Women on Waves Ireland was to \\"catalyze\\" the Irish movement to liberalize Ireland's abortion laws. At the time, Ireland had the most stringent prohibitions against abortion in Europe, with laws forbidding the procedure that dated to 1861. Women on Waves Ireland provided education about abortion and unwanted pregnancy to individuals and to groups in workshops. On that journey, they were not allowed to do surgical or medical abortions, and were limited by Dutch law to provide only information on contraceptives, and not the contraceptives themselves. The ship had been invited by Irish pro- choice organizations which coordinated a publicity campaign in advance of the Aurora's arrival. The ship anchored at Dublin Port, and traveled into international waters to provide educational services as Ireland's law prohibited discussion about abortion and contraceptives. During the ship's visit to Dublin Port, approximately 300 women participated. All of the ship's services were provided for free. In 2016, Women on Waves collaborated with pro-abortion group to use drones and speed boats to deliver abortion pills to women in Northern Ireland. =Poland= WoW sailed the Langenort to Poland in 2003. Women on Waves was charged with violating Poland's laws against abortion by bringing RU-486, also known as the abortion drug, into Poland. While docked, protesters pelted fake blood and eggs at the ship. Four months afterward, the government of Poland dropped the charges, noting that there was no evidence that Women on Waves had violated Poland's laws. Poland's official polling company, Centrum Badania Opinii Spolecznej, found that prior to WoW's visit, 44% of the population supported the liberalization of abortion laws, and that after the visit, the percentage rose to 56%. In 2015, WoW flew a drone carrying abortion pills from Frankfurt, Germany across the border to Slubice, Poland. German police attempted to prevent the drones from leaving, but were unsuccessful. Polish police confiscated the drones and the personal iPads of the drones' pilots. =Portugal= In 2004, the ship Borndiep, carrying the A-Portable, was physically blocked by a naval warship as it attempted to enter Portuguese waters. In 2009, the European Court of Human Rights rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiffs in Women on Waves and Others v. Portugal. The court determined that although Portugal had a right to enforce its laws prohibiting abortion, the nation could have enforced the law in less harmful ways, e.g. by sequestering the abortion drugs that were on board the ship. =Spain= In 2008, Women on Waves' ship landed in Valencia, Spain, where it had a mixed reception. Some demonstrators supported the group, others opposed it. According to Catholic News Agency, > \\"On 18 October a group of 40 feminists gathered to counter the pro-life > protests, which brought out four times as many people. They passed out boxes > of matches with the picture of a burning church and the caption, 'The only > church that brings light is the one that burns. Join us!' On 19 October the > feminists met again to distribute matches but decided to disband after they > were overwhelmed by the large number of pro-life protesters who gathered at > the port where the abortion ship was docked.\\" As the ship attempted to dock amid both pro-life and pro-choice protesters, harbor patrol agents in a small boat lassoed a rope around the helm of the ship and attempted to pull it away from the dock. =Morocco= Ibtissam Lachgar of MALI (Mouvement alternatif pour les libert√©s individuelles) invited Women on Waves to visit Morocco in 2012. On 3 October 2012, the Moroccan health ministry closed the port of Smir to prevent the entry of the Women on Waves ship Langenort. This was the first attempt by Women on Waves to make landfall in a Muslim-majority country. Anti-abortion protesters were present, many carrying signs against abortion. The activist Rebecca Gomperts was at the port to meet the ship, but she was escorted away upon encountering the protesters. =Guatemala= On 22 February 2017, the WoW ship docked in Puerto Quetzal on the Pacific coast for a planned five-day visit. On 23 February, a scheduled press conference was shut down shortly after it started and a blockade was imposed by Army troops, preventing the activists from disembarking and visitors from boarding. Catholic and other religious leaders and politicians spoke vociferously against the ship and its mission: \\" 'The boat of death has arrived in Guatemala,\\" said lawmaker Raul Romero during a Congress session earlier on Wednesday.\\" The WoW ship was ejected into international waters by a Guatemalan military ship. The argument to expel the boat was that they lied to the immigration authorities by saying that they were tourists, but in reality they are a health organization that aims to provide abortions to women.https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/internacionales/Expulsan-a-barco-de-ONG- proaborto-20170226-0048.html =Mexico= In April 2017, the Adelaide ship docked in Ixtapal Mexico, where abortion procedures are illegal in much of the country. To administer the procedures, the crew ferried the women seeking abortions thirteen miles out from Mexico‚Äôs Pacific coast, just past the edge of Mexican criminal law.

It is a popular destination for shopping, dining, and entertainment. The area has been under almost constant regeneration since the late 20th century as part of a citywide project of economic regrowth. It currently houses many bars and clubs popular with both locals and foreigners as well as international brand-name stores such as Uniqlo, Apple, Nike and Adidas. It is notable for housing the largest Adidas store in the world.  History  Prior to 1949, the Beijing Legation Quarter was the center of diplomatic activity in the capital. After the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the government wanted to move the diplomatic district outside the inner city. Sanlitun was chosen as the area where foreign legations and embassies were to be reallocated in the late 1950s. The area was called Sanlitun to designate its location from Dongzhimen gate (), with tun meaning 'locality' and san li meanings 'three li' (a li is 0.5 km), so that the name means \\"locality 1.5 km away (from Dongzhimen Gate)\\". Sanlitun began to grow when, along with the economic reforms of the late 1970s and early 1980s, bars serving expatriates and later locals began to open. International hotels introduced the first bars, but in the 1990s, standalone establishments appeared. Accounts differ over which was the first bar in Sanlitun, with one author crediting the Cat Cafe in 1995 while another names Frank's Place, which opened in 1990. The first supermarket in Beijing opened in Sanlitun in November 1982. This supermarket has an area about 300 square meters, selling a variety of products. The first bar on North Sanlitun Rd opened in 1995. After nearly 30 years, Sanlitun houses about 70% of bars in Beijing. South Sanlitun Rd used to have stores selling auto parts. After the construction of the Bar Street, those stores are demolished. Sanlitun Village opened in 2008, giving the area many new shops, restaurants, bars and a multiplex cinema. In 2013, Sanlitun Village changed its name to Taikoo Li Sanlitun. Sanlitun SOHO Topwin Center Sanlitun saw significant new construction as part of preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics. In April 2008, as part of an ongoing operation to clean up the city, a major drug bust occurred in Sanlitun and many arrests were made.Beijing police raid popular bar district for drugs A total of four bars and clubs were effectively closed, including a notorious bar known as Pure Girl for its cheap alcohol and availability of drugs, both its bartender and manager were executed for distribution of drugs. However, it has since reopened a year later with new management. The police operation was widely criticized for its violence and absence of proper due process. A number of drug dealers as well as a barman are believed to have received the death penalty as a result of this operation. The Uniqlo in Taikoo Li Sanlitun gained international attention after it was the site of a July 2015 sex tape that was filmed inside one of the store's fitting rooms. Uniqlo denied any involvement in the video. In an August 2015 incident near the Uniqlo, a Chinese woman was killed and her French husband was wounded in an attack by a sword-wielding man. On 25 December 2015, following the November 2015 Paris attacks by ISIS, several foreign embassies in Beijing warned of possible threats against Westerners in the Sanlitun shopping district on or around Christmas Day, urging their citizens to \\"exercise heightened vigilance.\\" A popular destination for foreigners and young people was the \\"dirty street\\" of hole-in- the-wall restaurants and bars at the center of Sanlitun. However, the street was cleaned up in 2017. As a landmark of Beijing, Sanlitun becomes a popular place to be chosen as the setting in many films and TV series.

History  Radio Jackie began as a pirate station first broadcasting in March 1969. Jackie broadcast on the 1525 kHz frequency and soon became one of the most popular pirate stations in the country. It changed frequency several times, settling on 1332 kHz in 1978 when the new European frequency guidelines were implemented. From February 1971, it also broadcast on FM on 94.4 MHz every Saturday evening. By the early 1980s, Radio Jackie had become a 24-hour-a-day local station with studios in Worcester Park and a shop in Morden. It employed full-time staff, was VAT-registered and had an entry in the phone directory--a very public operation for an illegal broadcaster. The station had huge public support with local borough councils and MPs supporting its wish to gain a licence. In 1972, a recording of the station was even played in the House of Commons at the committee stage of the Sound Broadcasting Bill, as an example of what local radio could sound like. In the mid-1980s, however, new laws meant that the days of pirate stations were numbered, and as one of the highest-profile stations Radio Jackie was an early target. Despite huge local protests the station ceased broadcasting on 4 February 1985. At the time it was south west London's second most popular station.  Licence Ten years after their pirate radio closedown, in 1996, Tony Collis made efforts to bring the station back as a legal broadcaster when the South-West London licence was advertised. A detailed set of plans were produced with a lot of community content, but the Radio Authority (now Ofcom) awarded Thames the licence on 107.8 FM. Over the years Thames Radio, as it was later renamed, fell into financial difficulty, and in 2003, the Radio Authority gave the original chairman Tony Collis permission to make a bid for the station. He purchased Thames Radio and Radio Jackie was relaunched on 107.8 MHz on Sunday 19 October 2003. The first song played was The Cars - 'Heartbeat City' because the chorus contains the lyrics 'Oh Jacki what took you so long'. The first on air presenter was Dave Owen who was the last presenter when the station closed down in 1985. Radio Jackie, Putney, London, 2016 Radio Jackie transmits from the top of Tolworth Tower.

At the present time, the Black Russian Terrier is a breed recognized by the FCI (FCI's from September 1983), AKC (AKC's from July 2004), CKC, KC, ANKC, NZKC and other cynological organizations. The contemporary Black Russian Terrier is a working dog, guarding dog, sporting and companion dog. Despite its name, the Black Russian Terrier is not a true terrier: it is believed that about seventeen breeds were used in its development, including the Airedale, the Giant Schnauzer, the Rottweiler, the Newfoundland, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog and other breeds. History The Black Russian Terrier was developed in the former USSR in Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) Kennel by the state for use as a military/working dogs. The breeding stock was largely imported from countries where the Red Army was active during the Second World War, especially East Germany. Breeds used in the development include the Giant Schnauzer, Airedale Terrier, Rottweiler, Newfoundland, Caucasian Shepherd Dog and other breeds. BRT were bred for working ability, rather than appearance, and early examples only resembled today's Black Russian Terrier in their build and coat type. The BRT was bred solely by the state owned Red Star Kennel in Moscow until 1957, when some puppies were sold to civilian breeders. These breeders began to breed for looks (as the original was rather plain) while retaining working ability. In time, the breed spread to the other parts of USSR like Saint Petersburg, Siberia, Ukraine and later to the first European country Finland and next to the other European countries: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany and finally to the United States, Canada, Australia and others. In 1955 the first working examples of the breed were put on show at an exhibition in Moscow and the first Breed Standard was published in 1958, which was then adopted by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 1984. In 1996 The Russian Federation Working Dog-breeders & Russian Kynological Federation (RKF) adopted a second Standard for the breed more in line to the modern day Russian Black Terrier. And it was also in 1996 that the breed was first introduced into the UK. In 1998 The Kennel Club added the Russian Black Terrier to the Import Register.  Description  =Coat= The coat is a double coat with a coarse outer guard hair over a softer undercoat. The coat is hard and dense, never soft, woolly, silky or frizzy. It should be trimmed to between 5 and 15 cm (2-6 inches) in length. It should form a beard and eyebrows on the face, and a slight mane around the withers and neck that is more pronounced in males. The coat is low-shedding and the colour is black or black with some scattered gray hairs. =Size= According to the FCI standard the male stands 72 to 76 cm and not more than 78 cm at the withers compared to the female's 68‚Äì72 cm and not more than 74 cm. The male weighs between 50 and 60 kg (110-132 lbs), and the females weigh between 45 and 50 kg (99-110 lbs). Nowadays, even larger individuals are tolerated if the dog is well proportioned and retains correct movements. At maturity (over 18 months of age), the AKC standard recommends 27-30 inches for males with the desired height between 27 and 29 inches and 26 and 29 inches for females with the desired height between 26 and 28 inches. A mature male less than 27 inches or more than 30 inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. A mature female less than 26 inches or more than 29 inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. Although the standard also states \\"Height consideration should not outweigh that of type, proportion, movement and other functional attributes.\\" In proportions, a Black Russian Terrier should be slightly longer than tall, a ratio of 9 ¬Ω to 10 being ideal. =Temperament= The character and temperament of the Black Russian Terrier is of utmost importance. The Black Russian Terrier is a calm, confident, courageous and self-assured dog, although they can also be stubborn and lazy. He is highly intelligent and adapts well to training. The Black Russian Terrier was initially bred to guard and protect. He is alert and responsive, instinctively protective, determined, fearless, deeply loyal to family, is aloof and therefore does not relish intrusion by strangers into his personal space. Shyness or excessive excitability is a serious fault. If you have a family with children, the Black Russian Terrier is a great fit for it. They are great companions for children since they have a strong guarding instinct towards children. Female Black Russian Terriers have more patience and will to play with children, but both sexes get along well with kids. BRTs have traditionally been used for a wide variety of tasks, such as carting Care The Black Russian Terrier, because of its breeding as a working dog, has a very strong \\"work ethic\\", and needs a job to do in order to be happy. Early training is a must and they are very responsive to firm, consistent training, excelling at Obedience competitions. They also perform well in other dog sports, such as Agility, and Schutzhund training. They have a low-shedding coat, and need grooming several times a week. Dogs who compete in conformation need to be groomed a minimum of every three weeks to keep the coat in show condition. This breed forms a strong bond with a single person and will not thrive if sent to boarding facilities. The young Black Russian Terrier needs much exercise, and may become hyperactive and destructive if not provided an outlet for its energy. Once the dog has reached maturity their energy level decreases dramatically and they are most content laying near their owner. Health The Black Russian Terrier is a generally healthy and somewhat long- lived dog (lifespan of 9‚Äì14 years), however it is prone to certain hereditary diseases: Major concerns: * Hip dysplasia * Elbow dysplasia * Hyperuricosuria * Juvenile laryngeal paralysis and polyneuropathy Minor concerns * Hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD) - a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies; * Panosteitis (Pano or Wandering Lameness) - a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies; * Heart Disease - the most common heart problems are aortic stenosis, mitral valve dysplasia, cardiomyopathy; * Eyes Disease - the most common eyes problems are ectropion, entropion, conjunctivitis; * Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Black Russian Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, contact allergies and inhalant allergies; Other problems * Hot spot; * Fungal infection - especially in ears and beard area. This is why it is extremely important to screen any potential breeders as well as their breeding stock. A well intended breeder will have all health checks on all breeding stock before making the decision to breed their dogs. While health checks on breeding stock can not guarantee a puppy will not develop any health issues later on, it is important to \\"do your homework\\" on any potential breeder.

Criminologist David Wilson believes that Ireland was a psychopath.Born to Kill?, Channel 5, 21 August 2012 Ireland suffered a severely dysfunctional upbringing. He committed various crimes from the age of 16 and had served time in borstals and prisons. While living in Southend, he started frequenting the Coleherne pub, a gay pub in Earl's Court. Ireland sought men who liked the passive role and sadomasochism, so he could readily restrain them as they initially believed it was a sexual game. Ireland said he was heterosexual: he had been twice married to women, and that he pretended to be gay only to befriend potential victims. Ireland claimed that his murders were not sexually motivated. He was highly organised, and carried a full murder kit of rope and handcuffs and a full change of clothes to each murder. After killing his victim he cleaned the flat of any forensic evidence linking him to the scene and stayed in the flat until morning in order to avoid arousing suspicion from leaving in the middle of the night. He was jailed for life for the murders in December 1993 and remained imprisoned until his death in February 2012, at the age of 57.  Early life  Ireland was born in 1954 in Dartford, Kent, to an unmarried teenage couple. Shortly after his birth, his father left him and his 17-year-old mother. His father is not named on his birth certificate, and Ireland did not know his identity. He was raised in poverty by his mother; they moved many times. In the early 1960s, she married. When she became pregnant, she put Ireland into care; he later returned to her. In 1966 she married another man. During the 1960s in Sheerness, Kent, Ireland was propositioned on three occasions and spied on once by men who were pedophiles. In his mid-teens, he was sent to borstal for theft, and whilst there, deliberately set fire to another resident's belongings. At age 17, Ireland was convicted of robbery. He escaped and was returned to borstal.  Early adulthood  In the attempt to make ends meet, Ireland had a series of manual jobs, then in December 1975, he was convicted of car theft, criminal damage and two burglaries, for which he was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. Ireland was released in November 1976 and moved to Swindon, Wiltshire. He lived with a woman and her children for a few months. In 1977, he was convicted of extortion, for which he was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. In 1980, he was convicted of robbery, for which he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. In 1981, he was convicted of attempted deception. In 1982, Ireland married Virginia Zammit; the couple and their daughter lived in the Holloway area of London. In 1985, he was convicted and sentenced to six months for \\"going equipped to cheat\\". He divorced in 1987, after his wife discovered he had committed adultery. In 1989, in Devon, he married Janet Young; he was violent towards her and stole from her. In the early 1990s, they separated; she and her children became homeless. He moved to Southend-on-Sea, where he became homeless and lived in a hostel. He later moved to a flat in the town and lived there whilst visiting the Coleherne pub, the gay pub in Earl's Court, London, where he first met his victims.  Victims  = Peter Walker = Peter Walker, a 45-year-old choreographer who enjoyed sadomasochism, took Ireland back to his flat in Battersea. There he was bound, and ultimately suffocated by a plastic bag being placed over his head. Ireland placed two teddy bears in a 69 position on the body. He left Walker's dogs locked in another room. The day after the murder, having heard no news reports of the crime, he called the Samaritans and a journalist from The Sun newspaper, advising them of the dogs, and that he had murdered their owner. He told them he wanted to become famous for being a serial killer. = Christopher Dunn = Dunn was a 37-year-old librarian who lived in Wealdstone. He was found naked in a harness, his death was initially believed to be an accident that occurred during an erotic game. In addition, because he lived in a different area from Walker, a different set of investigators worked on the case. For these reasons the death was not initially linked to Walker's. = Perry Bradley III = Ireland met a 35-year-old businessman named Perry Bradley III at the Coleherne pub. Bradley lived in Kensington and was the son of Texas Democratic Party fundraiser Perry Bradley Jr. The two men returned to Bradley's flat, where Ireland suggested that he tie Bradley up; Bradley expressed his displeasure at the idea. In order to get Bradley to comply, Ireland told him that he was unable to perform sexually without elements of bondage. Bradley hesitantly cooperated and was soon trussed up on his own bed, face down, with a noose around his neck. After Ireland had secured Bradley, he demanded money and a PIN under the threat of torture. Ireland assured Bradley that he was merely a thief and would leave after stealing Bradley's money. After Bradley gave Ireland his PIN, which Ireland later used to steal ¬£200, along with ¬£100 in cash stolen from Bradley's flat, Ireland told him that he should go to sleep, as he wouldn't be leaving his flat for hours. Bradley eventually did fall asleep and Ireland momentarily thought of leaving Bradley unharmed. Ireland then realised that Bradley could identify him and used the noose, which he had earlier attached around Bradley's neck, to strangle him. Before leaving Bradley's flat, he placed a doll on top of the dead man's body. = Andrew Collier = Ireland, angered that he had received no publicity even after three murders, killed again within three days. He met and courted 33-year-old Andrew Collier, a housing warden, and the pair went to Collier's home in Dalston. After entering the flat there was a disturbance outside and both men went to the window to investigate. Ireland gripped a horizontal metal bar that ran across the window. He later forgot to wipe the bar for fingerprints during his usual cleanup phase. The police found these prints. Once he had tied up his victim on the bed, Ireland again demanded his victim's bank details. This time his victim refused to comply. After killing Collier's cat, Ireland strangled Collier with a noose. He put a condom on Collier's penis and placed the dead cat's mouth over it, and placed the cat's tail into Collier's mouth. Ireland was angered at discovering Collier was HIV positive while rummaging through his personal effects looking for bank details. He then phoned the police, asking why they had not linked the four murders. He left the next morning with ¬£70. A suspected reason for his killing of the cat was that after Ireland killed Walker and had left this previous victim's dogs locked in a separate room, he later called anonymously to advise parties to the fact that these dogs were being or had been locked up. As a result, the media called the killer an animal lover. He strangled the cat to demonstrate that the \\"animal lover\\" assumption had been wrong. = Emanuel Spiteri = Ireland's fifth victim was a Maltese chef named Emanuel Spiteri, aged 41, whom he had met at the Coleherne pub. Spiteri was persuaded to be cuffed and bound on his bed. Once more, Ireland demanded his PIN but did not obtain it. He again used a noose to kill. After carrying out his post-murder ritual of cleaning and clearing the scene, Ireland set fire to the flat and left. He rang the police later to tell them to look for a body at the scene of a fire and added that he would probably not kill again. Criminal case = Investigation = There are suggestions that homophobia on the part of the police delayed the linking of all the murders and that they were initially not handled well, but police eventually connected all five killings. The crimes were publicised by the mass media and it quickly became known in the gay community that a serial killer was specifically targeting gay men. Investigations revealed that Spiteri had left the Coleherne pub and travelled home with his killer by train, and a security video successfully captured the two of them on the railway platform at Charing Cross station. Ireland recognised himself and decided to tell police he was the man with Spiteri but not the killer‚Äîhe claimed to have left Spiteri in the flat with another man. However, police had also found fingerprints in Collier's flat, which they linked to Ireland. = Trial, convictions and imprisonment = Ireland was charged with the murders of Collier and Spiteri, and confessed to the other three while awaiting trial in prison. He told police that he had no vendetta against gay men, but picked on them because they were the easiest targets. Ireland pretended to be gay in order to lure his victims.'Gay Slayer' serial killer dies in jail, Sky News, 21 February 2012 He had robbed those he killed because he was unemployed at the time, and he needed funds to travel to and from London when hunting for victims. When his case came to the Old Bailey on 20 December 1993, Ireland admitted all charges and was given life sentences for each. The judge, Mr Justice Sachs, said he was \\"exceptionally frightening and dangerous\\", adding: \\"To take one human life is an outrage; to take five is carnage.\\" On 22 December 2006, Ireland was one of 35 life sentence prisoners whose names appeared on the Home Office's list of prisoners who had been issued with whole life tariffs and were unlikely ever to be released. Ireland's crimes received sensationalist coverage in the tabloid press. As well as the nickname \\"The Gay Slayer\\", he was headlined as \\"Jack The Gripper\\" by the News of the World.Jake Arnott (2004), True Crime (The Long Firm Trilogy Part 3), Hodder General Publishing Division,  Death  Ireland died on 21 February 2012, at Wakefield Prison. A spokeswoman for Her Majesty's Prison Service said: \\"He is presumed to have died from natural causes; a post-mortem will follow.\\" Later, his death was ascribed to pulmonary fibrosis and a fractured hip he had suffered earlier in the month as preliminary causes of death.

In the revolution after the death of Khosrow's father Hormizd IV, the General Bahram Chobin took power over the Persian empire. Shirin fled with Khosrow to Syria, where they lived under the protection of Byzantine emperor Maurice. In 591, Khosrow returned to Persia to take control of the empire and Shirin was made queen. She used her new influence to support the Christian minority in Iran, but the political situation demanded that she do so discreetly. Initially she belonged to the Church of the East, the so- called Nestorians, but later she joined the miaphysite church of Antioch, now known as the Syriac Orthodox Church. After conquering Jerusalem in 614, amidst the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, the Persians captured the True Cross of Jesus and brought it to their capital Ctesiphon, where Shirin took the cross in her palace. Long after her death Shirin became an important heroine of Persian literature, as a model of a faithful lover and wife. She appears in the Shahnameh and the romance Khosrow and Shirin by Nizami Ganjavi (1141‚àí1209), and is referred to in very many other works. Her elaborated story in literature bears little or no resemblance to the fairly few known historical facts of her life, although her Christianity and difficulties after the assassination of her husband remain part of the story, as well as Khosrow's exile before he regained his throne. After their first accidental meeting, when Khosrow was initially unaware of her identity, their courtship takes a number of twists and turns, with the pair often apart, that occupy most of the story. After Khosrow's son kills him, the son demands that Shirin marry him, which she avoids by committing suicide.Baum's later chapters cover her literary depiction fully  Origin  Two early Syriac chronicles refer to Shirin as \\"Aramean\\", which would identify her homeland as the region known under the name Beth Aramaie in Syriac sources. The tradition identifying her as Armenian appears to be of later origin.  Marriage  Khusraw Discovers Shirin Bathing, From Pictorial Cycle of Eight Poetic Subjects, mid 18th century. Brooklyn Museum The earliest source mentioning Shirin is the Ecclesiastical history of Evagrius Scholasticus, where she is mentioned as \\"Sira\\". It preserves a letter sent by Khosrau II to the shrine of Saint Sergius in Resafa. One dated to 592/593 includes the following passage:Baum (2004), p. 30-32 \\"At the time when I [Khosrau II] was at Beramais, I begged of thee, O holy one, that thou wouldest come to my aid, and that Sira might conceive: and inasmuch as Sira was a Christian and I a heathen, and our law forbids us to have a Christian wife, nevertheless, on account of my favourable feelings towards thee, I disregarded the law as respects her, and among my wives I have constantly esteemed, and do still esteem her as peculiarly mine.\\"Evagrius Scholasticus, \\"Ecclesiastical History\\". Book 6, Chapter XXI (21). 1846 translation by E. Walford. \\"Thus I resolved to request of thy goodness, O Saint, that she might conceive: and I made the request with a vow, that, if Sira should conceive, I would send the cross she wears to thy venerable sanctuary. On this account both I and Sira purposed to retain this cross in memory of thy name, O Saint, and in place of it to send five thousand staters, as its value, which does not really exceed four thousand four hundred staters. From the time that I conceived this request and these intentions, until I reached Rhosochosron, not more than ten days elapsed, when thou, O Saint, not on account of my worthiness but thy kindness, appearedst to me in a vision of the night and didst thrice tell me that Sira should conceive, while, in the same vision, thrice I replied, It is well.\\" \\"From that day forward Sira has not experienced the custom of women, because thou art the granter of requests; though I, had I not believed thy words, and that thou art holy and the granter of requests, should have doubted that she would not thenceforward experience the custom of women. From this circumstance I was convinced of the power of the vision and the truth of thy words, and accordingly forthwith sent the same cross and its value to thy venerable sanctuary, with directions that out of that sum should be made a disc, and a cup for the purposes of the divine mysteries, as also a cross to be fixed upon the holy table, and a censer, all of gold: also a Hunnish veil adorned with gold. Let the surplus of the sum belong to thy sanctuary, in order that by virtue of thy fortune, O saint, thou mayest come to the aid of me and Sira in all matters, and especially with respect to this petition; and that what has been already procured for us by thy intercession, may be consummated according to the compassion of thy goodness, and the desire of me and Sira; so that both of us, and all persons in the world, may trust in thy power and continue to believe in thee.\\" Theophylact Simocatta gives a similar account with additional information. \\"In the following year the Persian king [Khosrau II] proclaimed as queen Seirem [Shirin] who was of Roman birth and Christian religion, and of an age blossoming for marriage, slept with her. ... \\"In the third year he entreated Sergius, the most efficacious in Persia, that a child by Seirem be granted to him. Shortly afterwards this came to pass for him.Excerpts from Theophylact's History. Chapters 13.7 and 14. 1 Translation by Michael Whitby The Roman (Byzantine) ancestry of Shirin is contradicted by Sebeos: \\"[Xosrov], in accordance with their Magian religion, had numerous wives. He also took Christian wives, and had an extremely beautiful Christian wife from the land of Xuzhastan named Shirin, the Bambish, queen of queens [tiknats' tikin]. She constructed a monastery and a church close to the royal abode, and settled priests and deacons there allotting from the court stipends and money for clothing. She lavished gold and silver [on the monastery]. Bravely, with her head held high she preached the gospel of the Kingdom, at court, and none of the grandee mages dared open his mouth to say anything‚Äîlarge or small‚Äîabout Christians. When, however, days passed and her end approached, many of the mages who had converted to Christianity, were martyred in various places.\\"\\"Sebeos' History \\", Chapters 4.

These were published under his own name and several pen names. Biography Born in Marple, near Stockport, Cheshire, Cooper left school at the age of 15. In 1942 he became engaged at 16 to a teacher four years older than he was, and married her four years later on 13 April 1946.Hans Joachim Alpers, Werner Fuchs, Ronald Hahn: Reclams Science- Fiction-F√ºhrer.

Deadly Image, the first novel to appear under his own name, was completed in 1957 and published in 1958 in the United States. (The novel was published in the UK later in 1958 in a variant form and under its better-known title The Uncertain Midnight.) The Uncertain Midnight was adapted without authorisation for Swiss television in 1969. His short story The Brain Child (1956) was adapted as the movie The Invisible Boy (1957), which featured the return of Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet. Cooper reviewed science fiction for the Sunday Times from 1967 until his death in 1982. In 2009, Carol Lake published Those Summers at Moon Farm (United Writers, Cornwall: 978-1-85200-141-4), a roman √† clef about the writer and family. The author's comments says 'Although inspired by real people, this story is fiction'. Dedicated in part to Joan and Edmund Cooper, Lake acknowledges the help of Glynis Greenman, one of Cooper's daughters, 'for sharing memories and anecdotes'. Work and criticism Cooper was an atheist and an individualist. His science fiction often depicts unconventional male heroes facing unfamiliar and remote environments.Ash, Brian: Who's Who in Science Fiction: Sphere Books Ltd; 1976 : \\"Cooper's forte is his portrayal of suspiciously Heinlein-type male heroes ... who act out their particular destinies (not always gloriously) against unfamiliar backdrops.\\" His novel The Uncertain Midnight was noted for its treatment of the subject of androids, which was considered original at the time of writing.Ash, Brian: Who's Who in Science Fiction: Sphere Books Ltd; 1976 Also uniquely treated is the subject of the colonisation of planets, which is the basis of Cooper's Expendables series, published under the pen name Richard Avery (the name of the hero of Transit). The Expendables series is notable both for the diversity of its cast of characters, and for the frank nature of their conversations and attitudes on racial and sexual topics. TwoFive to Twelve, Who Needs Men? (Gender Genocide) of Cooper's books depict future Earths dominated by women after the genetic or physical need for men has been reduced. His attitude to women is said to have been controversial.Edmund Cooper's Biography \\"commentary by the feminist mafia didn't help.'\\" Cooper was quoted as saying: \\"Let them have totally equal competition ... they'll see that they can't make it.\\"\\"We Must Love One Another or Die; an interview with Edmund Cooper by James Goddard page 3 The theme of both books is actually the need to retain both sexes.

In his novel Necropolis he visits Natzweiler-Struthof camp twenty years after his relocation to Dachau. Following Dachau, he was relocated three more times: to Mittelbau-Dora, Harzungen, and finally to Bergen-Belsen which was liberated on 15 April 1945. His success was not instant; openly expressing his disapproval of communism in Yugoslavia, he was not acknowledged and was probably intentionally overseen by his homeland until after Slovenia had gained its independence in 1991. It was not until 2013 that his novel was first translated into English. The first translation was titled Pilgrim Among the Shadows in 1995, and the second one Necropolis in 2010. The masterpiece has been translated into several other European languages; French: P√®lerin parmi les ombres (1996), German: Nekropolis (2001, 2003), Catalan: Necr√≤polis (2004), Finnish: Nekropoli (2006), Italian: Necropoli (2008), Serbian: Necropola (2009), Spanish: Necr√≥polis (2010), Dutch: Nekropolis (2011), Croatian: Nekropola (2012), Portuguese: Necr√≥pole (2013), and Esperanto: Pilgrimanto inter ombroj. Pahor is a prominent public figure in the Slovene minority in Italy, who were affected by Fascist Italianization. Although a member of the Slovene Partisans, he opposed Titoist Communism as well. He was awarded the Legion of Honour by the French government and the Cross of Honour for Science and Art by the Austrian government, and was nominated for the Nobel prize for literature by the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts.Boris Pahor was nominated for the Nobel prize , ff.uni-lj.si (Slovenian) He refused the title of honorary citizen of the capital of Slovenia because he believed that the Slovene minority in Italy (1920‚Äì47) was not supported the way it ought to have been during the period of Fascist Italianization by right-wing or left-wing Slovenian political elites. Pahor was married to the author Radoslava Premrl (1921‚Äì2009) and, at the age of 99, wrote a book dedicated to her.Boris Pahor turns 99 , slovenia.si; accessed 18 September 2015. He is, in addition to Slovene and Italian, fluent in French. Following the death of Marco Feingold on 19 September 2019, he became the oldest living survivor of the Holocaust. Early life under Italian Fascism View of Trieste, \\"The City in the Bay\\" from Pahor's novels Pahor was born into a Slovene minority community in Trieste, the main port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the capital of the Austrian Littoral region at the time. Pahor's father Franc was born in Kostanjevica na Krasu, a settlement that was severely ravaged by the Battles of the Isonzo during the First World War. Franc married Marija Ambro≈æiƒç and found a job in Trieste as a civil servant in the Austro-Hungarian administration. Under the Treaty of Rapallo, the Kingdom of Italy annexed territories that included a substantial ethnic Slovene population, and that included a quarter of Slovene ethnic territory and approximately 330,000 out of total population of 1.3Lipu≈°ƒçek, U. (2012) Sacro egoismo: Slovenci v krempljih tajnega londonskega pakta 1915, Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, Ljubljana. million Slovenes.Cresciani, Gianfranco (2004) Clash of civilisations, Italian Historical Society Journal, Vol. 12, No. 2, p. 4 After the annexation, and even more after Benito Mussolini came to power in 1922, the forced Fascist Italianization of the Slovene minority began. In 1920, Italian Black shirts in Trieste burned down the Slovene Community Hall (), which the young Pahor witnessed. All non-Italian languages (including Slovene and German) were forbidden as languages of instruction by the Fascist regime three years after this event. Between 1926 and 1932, all Slovene, Croatian, and German toponyms as well as first and last names begun to be subjected to Italianisation‚Äîduring which also his future wife's name (Radoslava) was changed to Francesca. Fascism had a traumatizing effect on young Pahor, which he remembered in an interview for Delo two months before his 100th birthday: Pahor later wrote about this childhood memory in one of his late novels, Trg Oberdan (Oberdan Square), named after the square on which the Slovene Community Hall stood, and also in essays. He enrolled in an Italian-language Catholic seminary in Koper, and graduated in 1935. He then went to Gorizia to study theology, leaving in 1938. The 1936 Fascist attack on Slovene choirmaster Lojze Bratu≈æ ‚Äî who was kidnapped, tortured, and killed on Christmas Eve because his choirs continued singing in Slovene ‚Äî was later referred to by Pahor as confirming his dedication to anti-Fascism and the Slovene ethnic cause, as well as a lifelong intellectual opposition to all totalitarianisms in the name of Christian humanist and communitarian values. Although no public and private use of Slovene was allowed and the relations between Slovenes living in Fascist Italy and those from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were forcibly cut off, Pahor nevertheless managed to publish his first short stories in several magazines in Ljubljana (then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) under the pseudonym Jo≈æko Ambro≈æiƒç, after he began to study standard Slovene during his stay in Capodistria and Gorizia. In 1939, he established contact with the Slovenian personalist poet and thinker Edvard Kocbek.Boris Pahor v Tivoliju o Edvardu Kocbeku, delo.si, 26 August 2013 (in Slovenian). Kocbek introduced him to contemporary literary trends and helped him improve his use of standard Slovene. In 1938, he returned to Trieste, where he established close contacts with the few Slovene intellectuals who were still working underground in Trieste, including poet Stanko Vuk and some members of the Slovene militant anti-fascist organization TIGR. Surviving Nazism and concentration camps View of Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp after liberation In 1940, Pahor was drafted into the Italian army and sent to fight in Libya. In 1941, he was transferred to Lombardy, where he worked as a military translator. At the same time, he enrolled at the University of Padua, where he studied Italian literature. After the Italian armistice in September 1943, he returned to Trieste, which had already fallen under Nazi occupation. After a few weeks in the German-occupied city, he decided to join the Slovene Partisans active in the Slovenian Littoral. In 1955, he described these crucial weeks of his life in the novel Mesto v zalivu (The City in the Bay), a story about a young Slovene intellectual from Trieste, wondering about what action to take confronted with the highly complex personal and political context of World War II on the border between Italy and Slovenia. The Littoral Home Guard‚Äîa local Slovene anti-communist and anti-Partisan military organization in Slovene Littoral that was directly subordinated to Odilo Globocnik‚Äîhanded 600 persons suspected of involvement with or sympathy to the resistance over to the Nazis, among them Boris Pahor. The Nazi administration first transported him to Dachau, from which he was relocated to Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines (Markirch) and Natzweiler-Struthof in Alsace. From there he was sent back to Dachau, Mittelbau-Dora, Harzungen, and finally to Bergen-Belsen, which was liberated on 15 April 1945. The concentration camp experience became the major inspiration of Pahor's work, which has been frequently compared to that of Primo Levi, Imre Kert√©sz, or Jorge Sempr√∫n. Between April 1945 and December 1946, Pahor recovered at a French sanatorium in Villers-sur-Marne, √éle-de- France. Opposing Communism Pahor returned to Trieste at the end of 1946, when the area was under Allied military administration. In 1947, he graduated from the University of Padua with a bachelor's thesis on the poetry of Edvard Kocbek. The same year, he met Kocbek for the first time. The two men were united in their criticism of the communist regime in Yugoslavia and established a close friendship that lasted until Kocbek's death in 1981. In 1951-52, Pahor defended Kocbek's literary work against the organized attacks launched by the Slovenian Communist establishment and its allies in the Free Territory of Trieste. This resulted in a break with the local leftist circles, with which Pahor had been engaged since 1946. He grew closer to Liberal Democratic positions and in 1966, together with fellow writer from Trieste Alojz Rebula, he founded the journal Zaliv (The Bay), in which he sought to defend \\"traditional democratic pluralism\\" against the totalitarian cultural policies of Communist Yugoslavia. The journal Zaliv was published in Slovene in Trieste in Italy outside of reach of Communist Yugoslavian authorities. This enabled Zaliv to become an important platform for democratic discussion, in which many dissidents from Communist Slovenia could publish their opinions. Pahor discontinued the journal in 1990, after the victory of the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia in the first free elections in Slovenia after World War II. Between 1953 and 1975, Pahor worked as an Italian literature instructor in a Slovene-language high school in Trieste. During this time, he was an active member of the international organization AIDLCM (Association internationale des langues et cultures minoritaires), which aims to promote minority languages and cultures. In this function, he traveled around Europe discovering the cultural plurality of the continent. This experience strengthened his communitarian and anti-centralist views. In 1969, Pahor was one of the co-founders of the political party Slovene Left (Slovenska levica), established to represent all Slovene leftist voters in Italy who did not agree with the strategy adopted by the Slovene Titoist groups after 1962 of participating in the mainstream Italian political parties (mostly the Communist Party of Italy and the Socialist Party of Italy).Profile, slovenskaskupnost.org; accessed 18 September 2015 (in Slovenian). The party eventually merged with the Slovene Union. Pahor publicly supported the Slovene Union on several occasions, and has run on its tickets for general and local elections. In 1975, Pahor and Alojz Rebula published a book in Trieste, entitled Edvard Kocbek: priƒçevalec na≈°ega ƒçasa (Edvard Kocbek: Witness to Our Time) and the 1975 Zaliv Scandal followed. Pahor, who lived in Italy and was an Italian citizen, was banned from entering Yugoslavia for several years. He was able to enter Yugoslavia only in 1981, when he was allowed to attend Kocbek's funeral. In 1989, his book Ta ocean stra≈°n√≥ odprt (This Ocean, So Terribly Open) published in Slovenia by the Slovene Society () publishing house, was dedicated to Pahor's memories of Kocbek and marked one of the first steps towards the final rehabilitation of Kocbek's public image in post- Communist Slovenia. Later years and recognition =Recognition in Slovenia= Boris Pahor at a public event together with the historians Milica Kacin Wohinz (left) and Marta Verginella (right) ;Pre≈°eren Award After 1990, Pahor gained widespread recognition in Slovenia. He was awarded the Pre≈°eren Award, the highest recognition for cultural achievements on Slovenia, in 1992. In May 2009, Pahor became a full member of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. ;2010 Documentary film In 2010, a documentary Trmasti spomin (The Stubborn Memory) was screened on primetime on the Slovenian National Television Broadcast, featuring several famous public figures that talk about Pahor, including Slovene philosopher who lives and works in Paris, two Slovene historians from Trieste, Marta Verginella and Jo≈æe Pirjevec, Italian writer Claudio Magris from Trieste, French literary critic Antoine Spire, Italian journalist Paolo Rumiz, and Slovene literary historian Miran Ko≈°uta from Trieste. ;Honorary Ljubljana Citizen proposal In 2010, several civil associations proposed him as an honorary citizen of the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana. However, the proposal stalled at the commission for awards of the City Municipality of Ljubljana, who decided not to forward the proposal to the Ljubljana city council for a vote since Pahor publicly refused the idea because the Slovene minority in Italy (1920-1947) was not supported the way it should be during the period of Fascist Italianization, neither by right-wing nor by left-wing Slovenian political elites in Ljubljana. =International recognition= It was predicted by a Slovene philosopher Evgen Bavƒçar living in France ‚Äì a Pahor's friend whose mother worked in Trieste like Pahor's mother did ‚Äì that as a Slovene writer Pahor would be recognized by Italian state only after he would be recognized by France and Germany. As explained in the 2010 documentary and in an interview with Pahor that was published in 2013 by Bukla Magazine,Interview with Pahor, Bukla Magazine, No. 91-92, ISSUU.com; accessed 18 September 2015. Italian publishers were not interested in publishing Pahor until French and German translations were published. Only after France and Germany recognized Pahor, his work begun to be finally published in Italy in 2007. In 2008, an influential article entitled Il caso Pahor\\" (\\"The Pahor Case\\"), deploring the fact that the author had remained unknown in Italy for so long and blaming the Italian nationalist milieu of Trieste for it, has emerged in the Italian journal La Repubblica: In 2008, Pahor was interviewed for the first time by RAI (Italian National Public Television). The interview was aired as part of the Che tempo che fa, a primetime Sunday talk show on the Italian public TV's third channel. In 2009, Pahor refused to accept an award by the mayor of Trieste Roberto Dipiazza because the mayor did not mention Italian Fascism alongside Nazism and Communism. causing a controversy on the political right in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, resonating in the Italian media, however, support of Pahor's decision was voiced by renowned Italian left-wing intellectuals, including the astrophysicist and popular science writer Margherita Hack, and the Trieste- based Association of Free and Equal Citizens (Associazione cittadini liberi ed uguali), offering an alternative award that would explicitly mention anti- Fascism. =International awards= In 2007, Pahor received the French Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government. In 2009, Pahor was awarded the Cross of Honour for Science and Art by the Austrian government. Theatre adaptation In 2010, a theater adaptation of Pahor's novel Necropolis, directed by the Trieste Slovene director Boris Kobal, was staged in Trieste's Teatro Verdi, sponsored by the mayors of Trieste and Ljubljana, Roberto Dipiazza and Zoran Jankoviƒá. The event was considered a \\"historical step\\" in the normalization of relations between Italians and Slovenes in Trieste, and was attended by numerous Slovenian and Italian dignitaries.Profile, vlada.si; accessed 18 September 2015 (in Slovenian). After the performance, Pahor declared that he could finally feel himself to be a first-rate citizen of Trieste. Literary achievements and influence Starting in the 1960s, Pahor's work started to become quite well known in Yugoslavia, but it did not gain wide recognition due to opposition from the Slovenian Communist Regime, which saw Pahor as a potential subversive figure. Nevertheless, he became one of the major moral referents for the new postwar generation of Slovene writers, including Drago Janƒçar, who has frequently pointed out his indebtedness to Pahor, especially in the essay The Man Who Said No, published in 1993 as one of the first comprehensive assessments of Pahor's literary and moral role in the postwar era in Slovenia. Pahor's major works include Vila ob jezeru (A Villa by the Lake), Mesto v zalivu (The City in the Bay), Nekropola (Pilgrim among the Shadows), a trilogy about Trieste and the Slovene minority in Italy (1920-1947) Spopad s pomladjo (A Difficult Spring), Zatemnitev (Obscuration), V labirintu (In the Labyrinth), and Zibelka sveta (The Cradle of the World). Five of his books have been translated into German. Political positions Pahor has been known for his lifelong defense of ethnic identity as the primary social identification. Pahor defines himself as a \\"Social Democrat in the Scandinavian sense of the word\\".YouTube; accessed 18 September 2015. However, he has supported different centrist positions, from Christian Democracy and Christian Socialism to more liberal positions. In the late 1980s, he was skeptical of the idea of independent Slovenia, but later supported Jo≈æe Puƒçnik's vision of an independent Slovenian welfare state. In 2007, he publicly supported the candidacy of the Liberal politician Mitja Gaspari for president of Slovenia. In 2009, he ran on the list of the South Tyrolean People's Party as a representative of the Slovene Union for the European Parliament. In 2011, before the Slovenian early elections, he publicly supported the Slovenian People's Party. Controversies In December 2010, Pahor criticized the election of Peter Bossman as the mayor of Piran on the basis of his ethnicity. He stated that it is a \\"bad sign if one elects a foreigner for mayor.\\" The statement echoed in the Slovenian and Italian media, and Pahor was accused of racism by some. He rejected these accusations, saying he had nothing against Bossman being black; he clarified his statement by saying that he would rather see a mayor from one of the indigenous ethnic groups from the region, either a Slovene or Istrian Italian. In March 2012, the Italian right-wing newspaper Il Giornale published a book review of his autobiography titled \\"Nobody's Son\\", in which the book reviewer labels Pahor a \\"Slovene nationalist\\" and \\"negationist\\" for his agreement with the historian Alessandra Kersevan's criticism of historical revisionism in Italy regarding foibe. The book review reproached Pahor for making personal observations about the period of Yugoslav occupation of Trieste (between May and June 1945), implying that he witnessed the events, although he did not reside in the city at the time.Il Giornale reproaches Pahor, ilgiornale.it; accessed 18 September 2015. In August 2013, Pahor criticized Giorgio Napolitano and Janez Jan≈°a for not explicitly mentioning Italian Fascism alongside German Nazism and Slovenian/Yugoslav Communism.Pahor o Jan≈°i in Napolitanu, Primorski Dnevnik, 28 August 2013 (in Slovenian).

It is not to be confused with the Palazzo Barbarigo Minotto and Palazzo Barbarigo della Terrazza, both also on the Gand Canal, and other palazzi, and several villas, once owned by the Barbarigo family. History It was originally built in the 16th century. It is distinguished by its mosaics of Murano glass applied in 1886. At the time it was owned by the proprietors of one of the glass factories, who were inspired by the exterior mosaics on the facade of St Mark's Basilica to apply those to the palace. The palazzo follows the Renaissance pattern of design on three floors: an open loggia gives access to the canal surmounted by a piano nobile with open loggias and decorated columns, with a \\"secondo piano nobile\\" (secondary floor) above. The comparatively modern mosaics probably cover original windows, and obliviate the original design. When the mosaics were executed, the then new owners were decried by their more aristocratic neighbours as nouveaux riches, and their taste garish and out of keeping with the genteel decay of the neighbouring buildings. However, it should be remembered that many of the Renaissance palazzi on the canal were once too covered in polychrome and gilt decorations, with elaborate plaster and stucco work. In the 1920s Palazzo Barbarigo was the headquarters of Pauly & C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano, the oldest of actually brands of venetian glass factory. Pauly was founded in 1866. Part of the Palazzo Barbarigo is today a showroom and shop of Murano glass.

It became a subsidiary of Kadokawa Group Holdings in 2004, and merged with another Kadokawa subsidiary MediaWorks on April 1, 2008, and became ASCII Media Works. The company published Monthly ASCII as the main publication. ASCII is best known for creating the Derby Stallion video game series, the MSX computer, and the RPG Maker line of programming software. History =1977‚Äì1990: Founding and first projects= ASCII was founded in 1977 by Kazuhiko Nishi and Keiichiro Tsukamoto. Originally the publisher of a magazine with the same name, ASCII, talks between Bill Gates and Nishi led to the creation of Microsoft's first overseas sales office, ASCII Microsoft, in 1979.Quote from Bill Gates' The Road Ahead, found in In 1980, ASCII made 1.2 billion yen of sales from licensing Microsoft BASIC. It was 40 percent of Microsoft's sales, and Nishi became Microsoft's Vice President of Sales for Far East. In 1983, ASCII and Microsoft introduced the MSX, a standardized specification for 8-bit home computers. In 1984, ASCII entered the semiconductor business, followed by a further expansion into commercial online service in 1985 under the brand of ASCII-NET. As the popularity of home video game systems soared in the 1980s, ASCII became active in the development and publishing of software and peripherals for popular consoles such as the Family Computer and Mega Drive. After Microsoft's public stock offering in 1986, Microsoft founded its own Japanese subsidiary, Microsoft Kabushiki Kaisha (MSKK), and dissolved its partnership with ASCII. At around the same time, the company was also obliged to reform itself as a result of its aggressive diversification in the first half of the 1980s. The company went public in 1989. =1989‚Äì2000: Satellites and later projects= ASCII's revenue in its fiscal year ending March 1996 was 56 billion yen, broken down by sectors: Publications (52.5% or 27.0 billion yen), Game entertainment (27.8% or 14.3 billion yen), Systems & semiconductors (10.8% or 6 billion yen) and others. Despite its struggles to remain focused on its core businesses, the company continued to suffer from accumulated debts, until an arrangement was made That CSK Corporation would execute a major investment into ASCII in 1997. In the mid-90s, ASCII acquired the company Something Good, and renamed it to ASCII Something Good, through which they developed 3 Sega Saturn Games: AI Shogi (1995), AI Igo (1997), AI Shogi 2 (1998). ASCII originally used the name Nexoft on early American releases. In 1991, they renamed Nexoft to ASCII Entertainment, although releases around this time used the Asciiware name. To focus on supporting the interactive entertainment channel in America, startup company Agetec (for \\"Ascii Game Entertainment TEChnology\\") was spun off as an independent corporation in 1998 and later became a fully independent publisher one year later. Co-founder Tsukamoto had left ASCII to create a company of his own in 1992, named Impress.Impress Holdings website =2000‚Äì2008: Ownership changes and dissolution= On November 26, 2001, CSK Corporation and Unison Capital Partners L.P. announced the approval of transferring the control of its subsidiary ASCII to Unison Capital Partners L.P., effective on March 30, 2002, as part of a strategy to focus CSK's operations on B2B enterprises. The transfer was approved on December 21, 2001. As a part of deal, ASCII's outstanding debt owed to CSK was forgiven, and under Unison's control, the ASCII's Enterbrain and IT publishing divisions would maintain autonomy, while ASCII was restructured to concentrate on PC and IT publishing businesses. On May 28, 2002, Unison Media Partners announced ASCII would become a fully owned subsidiary of via share exchange, and ASCII would be delisted, effective on October 1, 2002. On November 18, 2002, the Astroarts subsidiary was renamed to ASCII, while ASCII was renamed to MediaLeaves. The former Astroarts subsidiary would inherit the publishing business of the former ASCII. On January 29, 2004, Unison Capital Partners, L.P. announced the sale of ASCII's parent company MediaLeaves to Kadokawa Group Holdings, to be completed in March 2004. On September 27, 2007, Kadokawa Group Holdings announced the merger between subsidiaries MediaWorks and ASCII under the name ASCII Media Works, effective on April 1, 2008. The merger was approved in 2008. On January 10, 2010, the formerly named ASCII company MediaLeaves was merged into Enterbrain, dissolving the last of the ASCII entity.

It was conceived and marketed by Kazuhiko Nishi, then vice- president at Microsoft and director at ASCII Corporation. Nishi conceived the project as an attempt to create unified standards among various home computing system manufacturers of the period.Kazuhiko Nishi - eNotes.com Reference. MSX systems were popular in Japan and several other countries. It is difficult to determine how many MSX computers were sold worldwide, but eventually 5 million MSX-based units were sold in Japan alone. Despite Microsoft's involvement, few MSX-based machines were released in the United States.Faceoff: will MSX be a success in the United States.

She was built by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (Greenock, Scotland), with the keel being laid down on 19 April 1939. She was launched on 24 July 1940, and commissioned 12 June 1942. One of two sisters (the other was, appropriately, , see Scylla and Charybdis), Scylla was completed with four twin QF 4.5 in Mk.III in UD MK III mountings because of a shortage of the intended QF 5.25 inch gun mountings. The forward superstructure was considerably modified to accommodate these and also to increase crew spaces. Known as the 'toothless terrors', they proved to be very good anti-aircraft ships, often leading to comparisons with their sisters armed with the heavier QF guns. History A member of crew on the snow-covered deck whilst on patrol in the North Atlantic Scylla served with the Home Fleet escorting Arctic convoys. She was flagship of R. Adm. Robert Burnett during the battle for convoy PQ 18 in September 1942. She carried a signals intelligence team headed by F/O R. E. Gunn and on at least one trip to the Kola Peninsula she is reported as having collected Signals Intelligence (PRO HW 14/53 and 55). Scylla sailed for Gibraltar on 28 October 1942. The following month she was at the French North Africa landings (Operation Torch) as part of Force \\"O\\" with the Eastern Task Force, but in December was sent into the Bay of Biscay as part of the effort to catch homecoming Axis blockade runners. On 31 December 1942, she was directed to the German blockade runner by a RAF Coastal Command Whitley from 502 Squadron based at RAF St Eval, Cornwall. The aircraft piloted By F/O Arthur Hodgson had located Rhakotis in appalling weather after several attack runs they had run out of ammunition. The crew then shadowed the target for over an hour, reporting the vessel's position enabling Scylla to intercept Rhakotis some north-west of Cape Finisterre in position , when Scylla opened fire the Germans scuttled the ship. F/O Hodgson was awarded the DFC for his part in the operation. In February she returned to the Home Fleet for Arctic convoys but was back in the Bay of Biscay by June 1943 to cover anti-submarine operations. In July 1943 she stopped the Arklow schooner in the Bay of Biscay. Captain Dowds, formerly principal of the Irish Nautical College, was captain of the schooner. The officer in charge of the boarding party was a pupil of Dowds. There was a pleasant reunion, then Mary B Mitchell resumed her voyage to Lisbon, and Scylla continued her search for blockade runners. In September 1943 Scylla was part of the Support Carrier Force at the Salerno landings (Operation Avalanche) but came home to refit for duty as an Escort Carrier Flagship in October, which lasted until April 1944. The Sylla was one of two Dido class cruisers fitted with, an Action Information Organisation (AIO) room (the other was HMS Royalist) to co-ordinate radar and intercept information. Scylla was the allotted RN flagship for the Normandy landings and the flagship for Vice Admiral Philip Vian and it was considered vital to all shipping and naval movements in the area, particularly that of coastal RN MTBs and enemy E boats, to prevent blue on blue incidents. She served off Normandy as flagship of the Eastern Task Force, for 18 days. On 23 June 1944 Scylla was badly damaged by a mine and declared a constructive total loss. Although towed to Portsmouth, she was not disposed of until 1950, after use as a target between 1948 and 1950. She arrived at Thos W Ward, (Barrow-in-Furness, UK) on 4 May 1950 for breaking up.

It is one of the largest independent bookstores in the United States. Tattered Cover is open seven days a week at all branches, hosts prominent book signings, and is known for its customer service. Together, the stores maintain an inventory of over half a million books. Its LoDo store houses an events space that can seat over 250 persons, while its East Colfax store can seat around 100. History East Colfax Avenue location, a former theatre Cherry Creek location Tattered Cover opened in 1971 in the Cherry Creek district of Denver as a small bookshop. The original owner was Stephen Cogil, an Aurora native who became a Bookstore Consultant. It was purchased in 1974 by Joyce Meskis. Between 1973 and 1983, it expanded seven different times, and in 1986 it moved into and consolidated at a new location in the Cherry Creek neighborhood, which remained open for over 20 years. A second location was renovated and opened for business in 1994 in Denver's historic LoDo (lower downtown) district. In 1995, the Fourth Story Restaurant & Bar opened at the Cherry Creek location. In November 2004, a third location opened in Highlands Ranch. In April 2015, that store relocated to Littleton. The Cherry Creek location closed in June 2006 and moved to the newly renovated, long-defunct Lowenstein Theatre on Elizabeth Street at East Colfax Avenue in Denver. The Fourth Story restaurant did not move to that location and closed in 2006. Like many independent bookstores, Tattered Cover is a member of the American Booksellers Association, and Meskis served as president of that organization in the early 1990s. Meskis is a former board member of the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression and is also the recipient of The William J. Brennan, Jr. Award from The Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression, the PEN/Newman First Amendment Award, the Brandeis Award from Privacy International, and the American Library Association's John Phillip Immroth Memorial Award for Intellectual Freedom. Meskis announced the sale of the bookstore in 2015 to Len Vlahos and Kristen Gilligan. =Colorado Supreme Court case= In 2000 the store resisted, on First Amendment grounds, a search warrant for records related to purchases made by a customer suspected of illegally manufacturing methamphetamine. The case made national news, and was eventually decided in the store's favor by the Colorado Supreme Court. Officers were attempting to establish a connection between the suspect and books they found on how to manufacture the drug. The purchase in question was later revealed to be of a book on Japanese calligraphy.

He grew up in New Brunswick, made his fortune in the California Gold Rush, and became an influential figure upon settling in Monticello, Minnesota. He served in both houses of the Minnesota Legislature between 1873 and 1882. The Tobias G. Mealey House, his 1855 home in Monticello, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early years Tobias Mealey was born in Charlotte County, New Brunswick, Canada, in 1823 and was educated in the common school system. He engaged in farm labor and lumbering for a few years, then entered the retail trade at age 22. In 1849 he joined the California Gold Rush, where he put his hand to mining, retail, construction, and lumbering. In 1852 he returned to New Brunswick with $25,000 in gold. On the way he passed through Minnesota and liked what he saw there. In 1855 he married Catherine Prescott and together they emigrated to Minnesota. Saint Paul was too well established for him and Minneapolis had yet to come into prominence, so Mealey opted to settle in Monticello, then still called Moritzious. He sited their house on a hill away from the Mississippi riverfront to get away from the saloons, boatmen, and lumberjacks he found too raucous. Business and politics During his first year in Monticello, Mealey purchased an interest in a sawmill and opened a general store. In addition to hardware, groceries, footwear, and carpet, it was at the time the only store in Monticello to sell clothing. He soon sold both businesses and engaged in farming, but bought back into the general store in 1863. Later he developed business interests in a starch factory and a clothespin factory. His son S.J. joined him in running the general store. The elder Mealey forged connections with other influential Minnesotans, selling land to streetcar entrepreneur Thomas Lowry for a summer home and becoming close friends with railroad magnate James J. Hill. Active in politics, Mealey served as a justice of the peace and a probate judge in Wright County. Previously identifying as a Republican, he followed 1872 presidential candidate Horace Greeley into the breakaway Liberal Republican Party as he ran for and won election to the Minnesota House of Representatives. Running thereafter as a Democrat, he won election the following year to the Minnesota Senate, serving in the 1874 and 1875 legislatures. He declined a nomination to run again in the 1875 election, but was a delegate to the 1876 Democratic National Convention and returned as a state senate candidate in 1877. He won, but in 1878 Minnesota switched to four-year terms for senators, sending him into another election that November. He was reelected and served through 1882. During his term he was instrumental in passing a new tax code that so improved on prior law it was known as the \\"iron-clad tax law\\". Personal life Tobias Mealey married Catherine Prescott in New Brunswick in 1855. The couple had two sons and three daughters in Minnesota, enlarging their Monticello home several times to accommodate their growing family. In 1884 their daughter Susan married Rufus Rand, then vice-president of the Minneapolis Gas Light Company. As a wedding gift, the Mealeys gave the couple a large lot next to their own, upon which Susan designed the 30-room Rand House as a summer home. James J. Hill had a railroad spur constructed nearby for the convenience of his friend's wedding guests. Tobias Mealey died in 1904, whereupon Catherine moved in with one of their daughters. Their son S.J. ran the Mealey general store, as well as the starch factory (which had become a leading local business) and the Monticello post office. He went on to serve as president of the Monticello State Bank, president of the Monticello Preserving Company, and manager of the Monticello Mill and Elevator, and was credited as one of the leading businessmen in Wright County.

The works were finally closed for operation in 1964. Over ¬£3 million has been spent on restoring the engine, building and surrounding grounds, a full restoration of the park was completed by April 2010, and the park, museum, and beam engine re-opened for public access. The funding was secured through various sources including the Heritage Lottery Fund, Football Foundation, DCLG and Big Lottery Fund. The engine is now occasionally run for public display.

He is mostly known for his work on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles as well as the Star Wars Special Editions and prequel trilogy. He is best known for his frequent collaborations with American producer George Lucas, though he was also a long-time producer for British television playwright Dennis Potter. Early career and collaboration with Dennis Potter McCallum's career as producer began with Pennies from Heaven (1981), the film version of the 1978 BBC TV drama, for director Herbert Ross and writer Dennis Potter. After the commercial failure of the film, Potter invited McCallum to go to work in England. During the 1980s, McCallum's work with Potter included producing the films Dreamchild (1985), an unusual exploration by Potter of the creation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which was nominated for two BAFTA awards, and Track 29 directed by Nicolas Roeg; executive producing the landmark BBC-TV series The Singing Detective; and in 1989 producing the Potter-directed TV series Blackeyes. During the 1980s, McCallum also produced movies with filmmakers including David Hare (Strapless); Neil Simon (I Ought to Be in Pictures); Harvey Fierstein, whose HBO film Tidy Endings received two CableACE Awards; and Nicolas Roeg's Castaway. McCallum also produced the music video for the Rolling Stones' \\"Undercover of the Night\\", directed by Julien Temple. Collaboration with George Lucas On the set of Dreamchild, McCallum first met Star Wars creator George Lucas. =The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles= Several years after their first meeting, Lucas was preparing his first weekly live-action television program, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and turned to McCallum to produce the ambitious series, which was to be shot in 35 countries. With a unique perspective on the eventful early life of Indiana Jones ‚Äì including its cinematic qualities, an emphasis on storytelling and characters, and an enticing promise of new adventures each week ‚Äì McCallum attracted a stellar list of writers and actors to the creative ranks of the series. Among the directors with whom McCallum worked on the series were Bille August, Nicolas Roeg, David Hare, Mike Newell, Deepa Mehta, Terry Jones, Simon Wincer, and Carl Schultz. During its run, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences honored Young Indiana Jones with 12 Emmy Awards from 27 nominations. The series debuted on DVD in 2007, and McCallum served as executive producer on a series of 94 acclaimed documentaries that accompany the episodes and illuminate the real-life history behind their stories. =Star Wars= When Young Indiana Jones ended, McCallum produced Radioland Murders (1994), for which Lucas served as executive producer. During its production, Lucas confided to McCallum the plans for three new Star Wars movies. To test the nascent digital technology just then becoming available, McCallum produced revised versions of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi ‚Äì released in 1997 as the Special Editions. Assembling the teams that worked both in front of and behind the cameras, McCallum produced the next three films, which Lucas wrote and directed: Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace (1999), Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005). The Star Wars prequels also ushered in a new era of digital filmmaking, and McCallum played a leading role in its development, overseeing a team of creative and technical professionals that developed and created the industry's first all-digital production pipeline. McCallum makes a cameo appearance in The Phantom Menace during the end celebration scene. =Red Tails= McCallum was one of the producers of Red Tails, an action-adventure movie on which Lucas was executive producer, that pays tribute to the spirit of World War II's Tuskegee Airmen. The movie was released nationally in the U.S. on January 20, 2012. =Retirement from Lucasfilm= Following Lucasfilm's announced acquisition by The Walt Disney Company, on October 31, 2012, ForceCast.net podcast Lucasfilm's Steve Sansweet stated that \\"Rick has retired from Lucasfilm\\".\\"Weekly ForceCast: October 31, 2012\\", ForceCast.net, October 31, 2012.

They are sometimes also called Th√¥, T'o, Tai Tho, Ngan, Phen, Thu Lao, or Pa Di. There are about 1.7 million T√†y people living in Vietnam (based on the 2009 census and 5 years of population growth). This makes them the second largest ethnic group in Vietnam after the majority Kinh ethnic group. Most are in northern Vietnam in particular in the Cao B·∫±ng, L·∫°ng S∆°n, B·∫Øc K·∫°n, Th√°i Nguy√™n, and Qu·∫£ng Ninh Provinces, where they live along the valleys and the lower slopes of the mountains. They also live in some regions of the B·∫Øc Ninh and B·∫Øc Giang provinces. They inhabit fertile plains and are generally agriculturalists, mainly cultivating rice. They also cultivate maize, and sweet potato among other things. T√†y villages are usually based at the feet of mountains and are often named after a mountain, field or river. Each village has about 15-20 households. Because of their historical close proximity with the majority Viet, the T√†y and Viet have some mutual influences with regards to arts and religion. The T√†y are closely related to the N√πng and the San Chay in Vietnam and the Zhuang on the Chinese side of the Vietnamese-Chinese border. Religion The majority of the T√†y practices Then, an indigenous religion involving the worship of tutelary gods, gods of the natural environment, and ancestors and progenitors of human groups. The patterns of this religion are inherited from Taoism and the Chinese folk religion: the god of the universe is the Jade Emperor, in some local traditions (for example in the Qu·∫£ng Ho√† district of Cao B·∫±ng) also identified as the Yellow Emperor (Ho√†ng ƒê·∫ø). For their religious ceremonies they used to be able to recite Chinese characters but now along with the characters they use glosses because many of them can't recite anymore due to the fact that Vietnam schools don't teach Chinese characters. An altar for the ancestors is usually placed in a central location in the house. The altar room is considered sacred; guests and women who have given birth are not allowed to sit on the bed in front of the altar. Some T√†y have adopted Mahayana Buddhism under the influence of Vietnamese and Chinese culture. Language Characters formerly used by the T√†y people were added to Unicode in 2017. This one, U+2B86F, means \\"wealthy\\" and is romanized as gi√†u. It is a variant of , the corresponding character in Vietnamese.Ho√†ng Tri·ªÅu √Çn, T·ª± ƒëi·ªÉn ch·ªØ N√¥m T√†y [Nom of the Tay People], 2003, p. 178.

Members of the genus are trees or shrubs. Most are root parasites which photosynthesize their own food, but tap the roots of other species for water and inorganic nutrients. Several species, most notably S. album, produce highly aromatic wood, used for scents and perfumes and for herbal medicine. About 25 known species range across the Indomalayan, Australasian, and Oceanian realms, from India through Malesia to the Pacific Islands, as far as Hawaii and the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands off the coast of South America. Indian sandalwood (S. album) is found in the tropical dry deciduous forests of India, the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia, and Arnhem Land of northern Australia. It is the only species of the genus found on the Asian mainland, and may have been introduced to India from the Lesser Sundas centuries ago. Indian sandalwood has been stripped from most of India's forests, and is now rare in the wild. Five species, including S. album, are native to Australia. S. acuminatum, known as the sweet quandong or native peach, produces a shiny bright red fruit used increasingly in Australia for jams, jellies, chutneys, and pies. Four species, commonly called iliahi, are endemic to Hawaii. S. fernandezianum, endemic to the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands off the coast of Chile, was overexploited for its aromatic wood, and may now be extinct. Santalum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Endoclita malabaricus. Cultivation The initial challenges to cultivating Santalum are numerous, not only due to its germination and growth needs, but also the amount of growing time required for the tree to properly mature. Germination of Santalum seeds is not completely understood. Seeds cannot be effectively stored, and must be planted upon harvesting them from a fruiting tree. Even in doing this, the seeds may not germinate. As such, growing saplings can be quite labour-intensive. Furthermore, although Santalum trees photosynthesize on their own, the trees are hemiparasitic, with roots that seek out and tap the root systems of surrounding trees for water and nutrients. As such, each sapling is usually grown next to four or five host trees. Pruning of host trees is also needed at times, since Santalum trees require much sunlight for growth. To produce commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils, the trees have to be at least 40 years of age, but 80 or above is preferred. As such, those who begin cultivation of Santalum likely will not live to reap the rewards of their work. However, inferior sandalwood that has been cut or toppled at 30 years old can still fetch a decent price due to the demand for real sandalwood. Beyond these initial difficulties, growing sandalwood is not difficult, since it becomes more resistant to environmental stresses, pests, and diseases as it matures.

It is administered by .aeDA which is part of the UAE Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. The internationalized country code top-level domain in the Arabic alphabet of the UAE is ÿßŸÖÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™., which is represented as \`.xn--mgbaam7a8h\` in Punycode. Second and third level domain registrations The domain \`ae\` is administered by the UAE Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). Registrations are permitted directly at the second level (unrestricted zone) or at the third level (restricted zone) beneath several category labels. During 1995‚Äì2003 co.ae was used for commercial entities, but this has been deprecated by UAEnic in 2003 in preference to the commercial use of second- level registrations; existing co.ae registrations were allowed to be retained if their registrants so desire. During 2008 when ae was re-delegated to the TRA, the .aeDA published new policies in which co.ae was introduced only for local commercial companies provided that the name is connected to the business name. Re-delegation of .ae The .AE domain was originally delegated to UUNET. Recognising the domain should be administered in the country, the domain was transferred in 1995 to Etisalat, following a brief period of administration by the United Arab Emirates University. Since that time, Etisalat, through its division the UAE Network Information Center (UAEnic), has been responsible for the operation of the .ae domain. During GITEX 2006, the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority TRA announced that the .ae ccTLD management and operations will be re-delegated to the TRA from Etisalat/UAEnic, the current .ae ccTLD manager. A new entity called .ae Domain Administration (.ae DA) has been formed to take care of management and operations of .ae based on latest DNS and Domain Registry technologies. During January 2008, IANA officially re-delegated the .ae Domain to the TRA. On 3 August 2008, the .aeDA took over the DNS and launched their services with the new registry system which supports registry‚Äìregistrar model. Currently the .aeDA has accredited eight registrars from different parts of the world. For the first time, Internet users in the UAE will be able to register and manage their domain names under .ae automatically using an online system without going through manual process which used to take up to six weeks for domain registrations. As per .aeDA policies, current domain holders are allowed to transfer between registrars at no cost. The .ae is the first ccTLD in the Arab region to use the standard Registry-Registrar model and .aeDA is the first registry in the region to use the industry-standard Extensible Provisioning Protocol to manage its domains. Accredited registrars As of 26 April 2015, there are 20 accredited registrars: * Etisalat * Du * Ascio * Instra Corporation * Mark Monitor * IP Mirror * DataCenter99 * AEserver * InterNetworX * CPS-Datensysteme * Safenames * 123Domain * Consultix * Internetx * 101Domain * Durraq t/a Tasjeel.ae * Abu-Ghazaleh * Marcaria * BB- Online * DREAMSCAPE * EPAG * BUZINESSWARE Transfer between registrars Registrants (domain name holders) can transfer their domains from one registrar to another provided that they obtain a domain name password. Domain name passwords can be recovered online through .aeDA's website password- recovery.aeda.net.ae. After obtaining this password, registrants can supply this password to the gaining registrar who will be able to transfer it directly without dealing with the losing registrar. Losing registrars are prohibited from charging a fee when a domain transfer occur; however gaining registrars may do so. Domain name pricing .ae domain name retail prices ranges from to depending on the provider and the level of support and services provided with the domain name. The .ae registration prices have noticeably dropped since the introduction of .aeDA. Prior to 3 August 2008, .ae domains were offered by Etisalat for around per year while ac.ae, org.ae, gov.ae and sch.ae were offered for around per year. International providers used to charge around 100‚Äì in order to cover the administrative cost involved in the manual registration process. After .aeDA's go-live in August 2008, .ae registration price declined to as low as with international registrars. Domain name count On 16-Sep-2012 aeDA made an announcement on reaching the 100,000 registration mark in domain names. During Gitex2008, .aeDA domain name counter showed over 90,000 domain names currently held in the registry, making it the largest ccTLD registry in the Arab region. IDN and Arabic domain names On 2 March 2009, The UAE's Ministerial Council for Services passed a proposal by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority to register the domain address of 'Emarat' in Arabic script (ÿßŸÖÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™) for the country's Arabic domains, stating that the domain will contribute to increasing the number of Internet users visiting Arabic sites and further promote and strengthen the UAE's identity. During ICANN meeting no. 35 (21‚Äì26 June 2009) in Sydney, .aeDA representatives mentioned that aeDA's EPP-based registry system is fully compatible with IDN protocols and guidelines. In January 2010 ICANN announced that the UAE IDN ccTLD (DNS name: xn‚Äîmgbaam7a8h, ÿßŸÖÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™) was one of the first four new IDN ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process. ENUM of UAE (+971) .aeDA, the registry operator of .ae is also the official operator for UAE ENUM Space (971). The ENUM space was redelegated from the incumbent operator Etisalat since 16 April 2009.

They are enrolled in the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation. About half of the Mandan still reside in the area of the reservation; the rest reside around the United States and in Canada. The Mandan historically lived along both banks of the Upper Missouri River and two of its tributaries‚Äîthe Heart and Knife rivers‚Äî in present-day North and South Dakota. Speakers of Mandan, a Siouan language, they developed a settled, agrarian culture. They established permanent villages featuring large, round, earth lodges, some in diameter, surrounding a central plaza. Matrilineal families lived in the lodges. The Mandan were a great trading nation, trading especially their large corn surpluses with other tribes in exchange for bison meat and fat. Food was the primary item, but they also traded for horses, guns, and other trade goods. Population The Mandan population was 3,600 in the early 18th century.Pritzker 335 It is estimated to have been 10,000-15,000 before European encounter. Decimated by a widespread smallpox epidemic in 1781, the people had to abandon several villages, and remnants of the Hidatsa also gathered with them in a reduced number of villages. In 1836, there were more than 1,600 full-blood Mandans but, following another smallpox epidemic in 1836-37, this number was estimated to have dropped to 125 by 1838. In the 20th century, the people began to recover. In the 1990s, 6,000 people were enrolled in the Three Affiliated Tribes. In the 2010 Census, 1,171 people reported Mandan ancestry. Some 365 of them identified as full-bloods, and 806 had partial Mandan ancestry. Etymology Offering of the Mandan Indians, aquatint by Karl Bodmer The English name Mandan is derived from the French- Canadian explorer Pierre Gaultier, Sieur de la Verendrye, who in 1738 heard it as Mantannes from his Assiniboine guides, which call the Mandan May√°dƒÖna. He had previously heard the earth lodge peoples referred to by the Cree as Ouachipouennes, \\"the Sioux who go underground\\". The Assiniboine are Siouan speakers. Nearby Siouan speakers had exonyms similar to Mantannes in their languages, for instance, Teton Miw√°tha≈ãni or Miw√°tƒÖni, Yanktonai Miw√°tani, Yankton Maw√°tani or MƒÖw√°tanƒØ, Dakota Maw√°tƒÖna or Maw√°tadƒÖ, etc. The Mandan have used differing autonyms to refer to themselves: Numakaki (N≈≥mƒÖÃÅkh≈≥ÃÅ¬∑ki) (or R≈≥wƒÖÃÅ îka¬∑ki) (\\"many men, people\\") was inclusive and not limited to a specific village or band. This name was used before the smallpox epidemic of 1837-1838. Nueta (N≈≥ÃÅ îetaa), the name used after this epidemic (\\"ourselves, our people\\") was originally the name of Mandan villagers living on the west bank of the Missouri River. The Mandan probably used N≈≥mƒÖÃÅkh≈≥ÃÅ¬∑ki / R≈≥wƒÖÃÅ îka¬∑ki to refer to a general tribal entity. Later, this word fell to disuse and instead two divisions' names were used, Nuweta or Ruptare (i.e., Mandan N≈≥ÃÅ îetaa or R≈≥ÃÅ îeta). Later, the term N≈≥ÃÅ îetaa / R≈≥ÃÅ îeta was extended to refer to a general tribal entity. The name Mi-ah¬¥ta-nƒìs recorded by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden in 1862 reportedly means \\"people on the river bank\\", but this may be a folk etymology. Various other terms and alternate spellings that occur in the literature include: May√°tana, May√°tani, MƒÖw√°danƒØ, MƒÖw√°dƒÖŒ¥ƒØ, Huatanis, Mandani, Wahtani, Mantannes, Mantons, Mendanne, Mandanne, Mandians, Maw-d√¢n, Meandans, les Mandals, Me-too¬¥-ta-h√§k, Numakshi, R≈≥wƒÖÃÅ'k≈°i, W√≠hwatann, Mevatan, Mevataneo.Synonymy section written by D. R. Parks in Wood & Irwin, pp. 362‚Äì364. Gloria Jahoda in Trail of Tears states that they also call themselves the \\"Pheasant people.\\"Jahoda p. 174.

He was killed by a Sioux around a year after Bodmer painted him.Ewers, John C.: \\"Early White Influence Upon Plains Indian Painting: George Catlin and Karl Bodmer Among the Mandans, 1832-34\\". Indian Life on the Upper Missouri. Norman and London, 1988, pp. 98-109, quote p. 106. The Mandan language or N≈≥ÃÅ≈≥ÃÅ îetaa √≠roo belongs to the Siouan language family. It was initially thought to be closely related to the languages of the Hidatsa and the Crow. However, since the Mandan language has been in contact with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured. For this reason, linguists classify Mandan most often as a separate branch of the Siouan family. Mandan has two main dialects: Nuptare and Nuetare. Only the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. Linguist Mauricio Mixco of the University of Utah has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993. , there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive. , programs in local schools encourage students' learning the language.Personal communication from Mauricio Mixco in 1999, reported in Parks & Rankin p. 112. The Mandan and their language received much attention from European Americans, in part because their lighter skin color caused speculation they were of European origin. In the 1830s, Prince Maximilian of Wied spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and additionally prepared a comparison list of Mandan and Welsh words (he thought that the Mandan may have been displaced Welsh).Chafe pp. 37‚Äì38. The theory of the Mandan-Welsh connection was also supported by George Catlin, but researchers have found no evidence of such ancestry. Mandan has different grammatical forms that depend on the sex of the addressee. Questions asked of men must use the suffix -o î≈°a while the suffix -o îrƒÖ is used when asking of women. Likewise the indicative suffix is -o îs when addressing men and -o îre when addressing women, and also for imperatives: -ta (male), -rƒÖ (female).Hollow 1970, p. 457 (in Mithun p. 280). Mandan, like many other North American languages, has elements of sound symbolism in their vocabulary. A sound often denotes smallness/less intensity, denotes medium- ness, denotes largeness/greater intensity:Hollow & Parks 1980, p. 82. * s√≠re \\"yellow\\" * ≈°√≠re \\"tawny\\" * x√≠re \\"brown\\" * sr√≥ \\"tinkle\\" * xr√≥ \\"rattle\\" History Buffalo Dance: \\"Bison-Dance of the Mandan Indians in front of their Medecine Lodge in Mih-Tutta-Hankush\\": aquatint by Karl Bodmer from the book \\"Maximilian, Prince of Wied's Travels in the Interior of North America, during the years 1832‚Äì1834\\" =Origins and early history= The exact origins and early history of the Mandan is unknown. Early studies by linguists gave evidence that the Mandan language may have been closely related to the language of the Ho-Chunk or Winnebago people of present-day Wisconsin. Scholars theorize the Mandan ancestors may have settled in the Wisconsin area at one time. This idea is possibly confirmed in their oral history, which refers to their having come from an eastern location near a lake. Ethnologists and scholars studying the Mandan subscribe to the theory that, like other Siouan-speaking people (possibly including the Hidatsa), they originated in the area of the mid-Mississippi River and the Ohio River valleys in present- day Ohio. If this was the case, the Mandan would have migrated north into the Missouri River Valley and its tributary the Heart River in present-day North Dakota. That is where Europeans first encountered the historical tribe. This migration is believed to have occurred possibly as early as the 7th century but probably between 1000 CE and the 13th century, after the cultivation of maize was adopted.Hodge, p. 796. It was a period of a major climatic shift, creating warmer, wetter conditions that favored their agricultural production.Elizabeth Fenn, Encounters at the Hear of the World, New York: Hill and Wang, 2015 paperback, p. 8 After their arrival on the banks of the Heart River, the Mandan constructed several villages, the largest of which were at the mouth of the river. Archeological evidence and ground imaging radar have revealed changes in the defensive boundaries of these villages over time. The people built new ditches and palisades circumscribing smaller areas as their populations reduced. What was known as Double Ditch Village was located on the east bank of the Missouri River, north of where present-day Bismarck developed. It was occupied by the Rupture Mandan for nearly 300 years. Today the site has depressions that are evidence of their lodges and smaller ones where they created cache pits to store dehydrated corn. The name comes from two defensive trenches built outside the area of the lodges. Construction of the fortifications here and at other locations along the Missouri has been found to have correlated to periods of drought, when peoples would have raided each other for food.Fenn (2015), pp. 4-11, 13 At some point during this time, the Hidatsa people also moved into the region. They also spoke a Siouan language. Mandan tradition states that the Hidatsa were a nomadic tribe until their encounter with the Mandan, who taught them to build stationary villages and cultivate agriculture. The Hidatsa continued to maintain amicable relations with the Mandan and constructed villages north of them on the Knife River. Later the Pawnee and Arikara moved from the Republican River north along the Missouri River. They were Caddoan language speakers, and the Arikara were often early competitors with the Mandan, although both were horticulturalists. They built a settlement known as Crow Creek village on a bluff above the Missouri. The modern town of Chamberlain, South Dakota developed about eleven miles south of here.Fenn (2015), p. 11-13 The Mandan were divided into bands. The Nup'tadi (does not translate) was the largest linguistic group. The other bands were the Is'tope (\\"those who tattooed themselves\\"), Ma'nana'r (\\"those who quarreled\\"), Nu'itadi (\\"our people\\"), and the Awi'ka-xa / Awigaxa (does not translate). The Nup'tadi and Nu'itadi lived on both banks of the Missouri River, while the Awigaxa lived further upstream at the Painted Woods. The bands all practiced extensive farming, which was carried out by the women, including the drying and processing of corn. The Mandan-Hidatsa settlements, called the \\"Marketplace of the Central Plains\\", were major hubs of trade in the Great Plains Indian trading networks. Crops were exchanged, along with other goods that traveled from as far as the Pacific Northwest Coast. Investigation of their sites on the northern Plains have revealed items traceable as well to the Tennessee River, Florida, the Gulf Coast, and the Atlantic Seaboard.Fenn (2015), p. 18 The Mandan gradually moved upriver, and consolidated in present-day North Dakota by the fifteenth century. From 1500 to about 1782, the Mandan reached their \\"apogee\\" of population and influence. Their villages showed increasing densities as well as stronger fortifications, for instance at Huff Village. It had 115 large lodges with more than 1,000 residents.Fenn (2015), Preface, and pp. 15-18' The bands did not often move along the river until the late 18th century, after their populations plummeted due to smallpox and other epidemics. =European encounter= Painting of a Mandan village by George Catlin, c. 1832 The Koatiouak, mentioned in a 1736 letter by Jesuit Jean-Pierre Aulneau, are identified as Mandans. Aulneau was killed before his planned expedition to visit the Mandans could take place. The first European known to visit the Mandan was the French Canadian trader Sieur de la Verendrye in 1738.Burpee, Lawrence J. (Ed.): Journals and Letters of Pierre Gaultier de Varennes de la V√©rendrye and His Sons. New York, 1968. The Mandans carried him into their village, whose location is unknown.It was formerly thought that the village was Menoken, this was disproved when Menoken was shown to belong to an earlier periodMeyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, pp. 18 and 21. It is estimated that at the time of his visit, 15,000 Mandan resided in the nine well-fortified villages on the Heart River; some villages had as many as 1,000 lodges. According to V√©rendrye, the Mandans at that time were a large, powerful, prosperous nation who were able to dictate trade on their own terms. They traded with other Native Americans both from the north and the south, from downriver. Horses were acquired by the Mandan in the mid-18th century from the Apache to the South. The Mandan used them both for transportation, to carry packs and pull travois, and for hunting. The horses helped with the expansion of Mandan hunting territory on to the Plains. The encounter with the French from Canada in the 18th century created a trading link between the French and Native Americans of the region; the Mandan served as middlemen in the trade in furs, horses, guns, crops and buffalo products. Spanish merchants and officials in St. Louis (after France had ceded its territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain in 1763) explored the Missouri and strengthened relations with the Mandan (whom they called Mandanas). They wanted to discourage trade in the region by the English and the Americans, but the Mandan carried on open trade with all competitors. They were not going to be limited by the maneuvering of the Europeans. French traders in St. Louis also sought to establish direct overland communication between Santa F√© and their city; the fur trading Chouteau brothers gained a Spanish monopoly on trade with Santa Fe. A smallpox epidemic broke out in Mexico City in 1779/1780. It slowly spread northward through the Spanish empire, by trade and warfare, reaching the northern plains in 1781. The Comanche and Shoshone had become infected and carried the disease throughout their territory. Other warring and trading peoples also became infected. The Mandan lost so many people that the number of clans was reduced from thirteen to seven; three clan names from villages west of the Missouri were lost altogether. They eventually moved northward about 25 miles, and consolidated into two villages, one on each side of the river, as they rebuilt following the epidemic. Similarly afflicted, the much reduced Hidatsa people joined them for defense. Through and after the epidemic, they were raided by Lakota Sioux and Crow warriors.Elizabeth A. Fenn, Encounters at the Heart of the World, New York: Hill and Wang, 2014/2015 paperback, pp. 155-166 In 1796 the Mandan were visited by the Welsh explorer John Evans, who was hoping to find proof that their language contained Welsh words. Numerous European Americans held that there were Welsh Indians in these remote areas, a persistent myth that was widely written about. Evans had arrived in St. Louis two years prior, and after being imprisoned for a year, was hired by Spanish authorities to lead an expedition to chart the upper Missouri. Evans spent the winter of 1796‚Äì97 with the Mandan but found no evidence of any Welsh influence. In July 1797 he wrote to Dr. Samuel Jones, \\"Thus having explored and charted the Missurie for 1,800 miles and by my Communications with the Indians this side of the Pacific Ocean from 35 to 49 degrees of Latitude, I am able to inform you that there is no such People as the Welsh Indians.\\"Williams, Gwen A., Madoc, the Making of a Myth, Eyre Methuen, 1979 British and French Canadians from the north carried out more than twenty fur-trading expeditions down to the Hidatsa and Mandan villages in the years 1794 to 1800.Wood, Raymond W. and Thomas D. Thiessen: Early Fur Trade on the Northern Plains. Canadian Traders Among the Mandan and Hidatsa Indians. Norman and London, 1987, Table 1. Painting of Mandan Chief Big White By 1804 when Lewis and Clark visited the tribe, the number of Mandan had been greatly reduced by smallpox epidemics and warring bands of Assiniboine, Lakota and Arikara. (Later they joined with the Arikara in defense against the Lakota.) The nine villages had consolidated into two villages in the 1780s, one on each side of the Missouri. But they continued their famous hospitality, and the Lewis and Clark expedition stopped near their villages for the winter because of it. In honor of their hosts, the expedition dubbed the settlement they constructed Fort Mandan. It was here that Lewis and Clark first met Sacagawea, a captive Shoshone woman. Sacagawea accompanied the expedition as it traveled west, assisting them with information and translating skills as they journeyed toward the Pacific Ocean. Upon their return to the Mandan villages, Lewis and Clark took the Mandan Chief Sheheke (Coyote or Big White) with them to Washington to meet with President Thomas Jefferson. He returned to the upper Missouri. He had survived the smallpox epidemic of 1781, but in 1812 Chief Sheheke was killed in a battle with Hidatsa.Potter 178 In 1825 the Mandans signed a peace treaty with the leaders of the Atkinson-O'Fallon Expedition. The treaty required that the Mandans recognize the supremacy of the United States, admit that they reside on United States territory, and relinquish all control and regulation of trade to the United States.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2. Treaty with the Mandan Tribe, p. 242-244. The Mandan and the United States Army never met in open warfare.Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 54. In 1832, artist George Catlin visited the Mandan near Fort Clark. Catlin painted and drew scenes of Mandan life as well as portraits of chiefs, including Four Bears or Ma-to-toh-pe. His skill at rendering so impressed Four Bears that he invited Catlin as the first man of European descent to be allowed to watch the sacred annual Okipa ceremony. During the winter months of 1833 and 1834, Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied and Swiss artist Karl Bodmer stayed with the Mandan. Speculation about pre-Columbian European contact 18th-century reports about characteristics of Mandan lodges, religion and occasional physical features among tribal members, such as blue and grey eyes along with lighter hair coloring, stirred speculation about the possibility of pre- Columbian European contact. Catlin believed the Mandan were the \\"Welsh Indians\\" of folklore, descendants of Prince Madoc and his followers who emigrated to America from Wales in about 1170. This view was popular at the time but has since been disputed by the bulk of scholarship.Newman 255‚Äì272 Hjalmar Holand had proposed that interbreeding with Norse survivors might explain the \\"blond\\" Indians among the Mandan on the Upper Missouri River.Hjalmar Holand, \\"The Kensington Rune Stone: A Study in Pre-Columbian American History.\\" Ephraim WI, self-published (1932). In a multidisciplinary study of the Kensington Runestone, anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe dismissed, as \\"tangential\\" to the Runestone issue, this and other historical references suggesting pre-Columbian contacts with 'outsiders', such as the Hochunk (Winnebago) story about an ancestral hero \\"Red Horn\\" and his encounter with \\"red-haired giants\\".Alice Beck Kehoe, The Kensington Runestone: Approaching a Research Question Holistically, Long Grove IL, Waveland Press (2004) .

Archaeologist Ken Feder has stated that none of the material evidence that would be expected from a Viking presence in and travel through the American Midwest exists. = Intertribal warfare 1785-1845 = Sioux Indians attacked the Mandan village Nuptadi and set it on fire around 1785.

Between 1837 and 1838, another smallpox epidemic swept the region. In June 1837, an American Fur Company steamboat traveled westward up the Missouri River from St. Louis. Its passengers and traders aboard infected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara tribes. There were approximately 1,600 Mandan living in the two villages at that time. The disease killed 90% of the Mandan people, effectively destroying their settlements. Almost all the tribal members, including the second chief, Four Bears, died. Estimates of the number of survivors vary from 27 up to 150 persons, with some sources placing the number at 125. The survivors banded together with the nearby surviving Hidatsa in 1845 and moved upriver, where they developed Like-a-Fishhook Village. The Mandan believed they had been infected by whites associated with the steamboat and Fort Clark. Chief Four Bears reportedly said, while ailing, \\"a set of Black harted Dogs, they have deceived Me, them that I always considered as Brothers, has turned Out to be My Worst enemies\\". Francis Chardon, in his Journal at Fort Clark 1834‚Äì1839, wrote that the Gros Ventres (ie. Hidatsa), \\"swear vengeance against all the Whites, as they say the small pox was brought here by the S[team] B[oat].\\" (Chardon, Journal, p. 126). In the earliest detailed study of the event, in The American Fur Trade of the Far West (1902), Hiram M. Chittenden blamed the American Fur Company for the epidemic. Oral traditions of the affected tribes continue to claim that whites were to blame for the disease. R. G. Robertson in his book Rotting Face: Smallpox and the American Indian, blames Captain Pratte of the steamboat St. Peter for failing to quarantine passengers and crew once the epidemic broke out, stating that while > not guilty of premeditated genocide, but he was guilty of contributing to > the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The law calls his offence > criminal negligence. Yet in light of all the deaths, the almost complete > annihilation of the Mandans, and the terrible suffering the region endured, > the label criminal negligence is benign, hardly befitting an action that had > such horrendous consequences.Robertson, Rotting Face, pp. 299‚Äì303. Scholars who have suggested that there was intentional transmission of smallpox to Native Americans during the 1836-40 epidemic include Ann F. Ramenofsky in 1987 and Ward Churchill in 1992. According to Ramenofsky, \\"Variola Major can be transmitted through contaminated articles such as clothing or blankets. In the nineteenth century, the U. S. Army sent contaminated blankets to Native Americans, especially Plains groups, to control the Indian problem.\\"Vectors of Death: The Archaeology of European Contact; University of New Mexico Press; 1987; p. 147-148 Churchill agreed, asserting that in 1837 at Fort Clark the United States Army deliberately infected Mandan Indians by distributing blankets that had been exposed to smallpox.Indians Are Us? Culture and Genocide in Native North America (Monroe, ME: Common Courage Press, 1994; Pgs. 11, 35) He said that the blankets were allegedly taken from a military infirmary in St. Louis, that smallpox vaccine was withheld from the Indians, and that an army doctor had advised the infected Indians to disperse, further spreading the disease and causing over 100,000 deaths. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs did refuse to send vaccine to the Mandans, apparently not thinking them worthy of protection.Fenn (2015), p. Some accounts repeat a story that an Indian sneaked aboard the St. Peter and stole a blanket from an infected passenger, thus starting the epidemic. The many variations of this account have been criticized by both historians and contemporaries as fiction, a fabrication intended to assuage the guilt of white settlers for displacing the Indians.R. G. Robertson, Rotting Face: Smallpox and the American Indian; Caxton Press; 2001, pp. 80-83; 298-312 \\"The blanket affair was created afterward and is not to be credited\\", notes B. A. Mann.Barbara Alice Mann, The Tainted Gift: The Disease Method of Frontier Expansion; ABC-CLIO Publishers; 2009; pp. 62-63 Given trade and travel patterns, there were numerous ways for people to have been infected, as they were in earlier, also severe epidemics. =Late 19th and the 20th centuries= Dance lodge from the Elbowoods area on the Fort Berthold Reservation.

The Mandan were a party in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. They shared a mutual treaty area north of Heart River with the Hidatsa and the Arikara. Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan Indian territory, 1851. Like-a-Fishhook Village, Fort Berthold I and II, and military post Fort Buford, North Dakota. Soon attacks on hunting parties by Lakota and other Sioux made it difficult for the Mandan to be safe in the treaty area. The tribes called for the United States Army to intervene, and they would routinely ask for such aid until the end of Lakota primacy.Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln, NE and London, 1977, p. 106. Despite the treaty, the Mandan received little protection from US forces. In the summer of 1862, the Arikara joined the Mandan and Hidatsa in Like-a-Fishhook Village on the upper Missouri. All three tribes were forced to live outside their treaty area south of the Missouri by the frequent raiding of Lakota and other Sioux.Meyer (1977), The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri, p. 108. Before the end of 1862, some Sioux Indians set fire to part of a Like-a-Fishhook Village.Meyer (1977), The Village Indians, p. 119. In June 1874, there \\"was a big war\\" near Like-a- Fishhook-Village.Howard, James H.: \\"Butterfly's Mandan Winter Count: 1833-1876\\". Ethnohistory, Vol, 7, (Winter 1960), pp. 28-43, quote p. 39. Colonel George Armstrong Custer failed to cut off a large war party of Lakota that was attacking the Mandan, although \\"... the Mandans should be protected same as white settlers\\". Five Arikaras and a Mandan were killed by the Lakota. The attack turned out to be one of the last made by the Lakota on the Three Tribes.McGinnis, Anthony: Counting Coup and Cutting Horses. Intertribal Warfare on the Northern Plains, 1738-1889. Evergreen, 1990, p. 133. Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan 1851 treaty territory. (Area 529, 620 and 621 south of the Missouri). Fort Berthold Indian Reservation included land both south and north of the Missouri (the light pink area). The acreage of the reservation was reduced later. The Mandan joined with the Arikara in 1862. By this time, Like- a-Fishhook Village had become a major center of trade in the region. By the 1880s, though, the village was abandoned. In the second half of the 19th century, the Three Affiliated Tribes (the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara) gradually lost control of some of their holdings. The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 recognized 12 million acres (49,000 km¬≤) of land in the territory owned jointly by these tribes. With the creation of the Fort Berthold Reservation by Executive Order on April 12, 1870, the federal government acknowledged only that the Three Affiliated Tribes held 8 million acres (32,000 km¬≤). On July 1, 1880, another executive order deprived the tribes of 7 million acres (28,000 km¬≤) of land lying outside the boundaries of the reservation. =20th century to present= In the early 20th century, the government seized more land; by 1910, the reservation was reduced to 900,000 acres (3,600 km¬≤).Pritzker p. 335. This land is located in Dunn, McKenzie, McLean, Mercer, Mountrail and Ward counties in North Dakota. Under the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, which encouraged tribes to restore their governments, the Mandan officially merged with the Hidatsa and the Arikara. They drafted a constitution to elect representative government and formed the federally recognized Three Affiliated Tribes, known as the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation. In 1951, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of Garrison Dam on the Missouri River. Developed for flood control and irrigation, this dam created Lake Sakakawea. It flooded portions of the Fort Berthold Reservation, including the villages of Fort Berthold and Elbowoods, as well as a number of other villages. The former residents of these villages were moved and New Town was constructed for them. While New Town was constructed for the displaced tribal members, much damage was done to the social and economic foundations of the reservation by the loss of flooded areas. The flooding claimed approximately one quarter of the reservation's land. This land contained some of the most fertile agricultural areas upon which their economy had been developed. The Mandan did not have other land that was as fertile or viable for agriculture. In addition, the flooding claimed the sites of historic villages and archaeological sites with sacred meaning for the peoples. Culture =Lodges and villages= \\"Mih-Tutta-Hangjusch, a Mandan village\\": aquatint by Karl Bodmer from the book Maximilian, Prince of Wied's Travels in the Interior of North America, during the years 1832‚Äì1834. The name of the village is usually spelled \\"Mitutanka\\" now. Located on the west bank of the Missouri River, it was burned by Yankton Sioux Indians in 1839. Mandan earth lodge, photographed by Edward S. Curtis, circa 1908 Snow scene of a modern reconstructed earth lodge at the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site, North Dakota The Mandan were known for their distinctive, large, circular earthen lodges, in which more than one family lived. Their permanent villages were composed of these lodges. Constructed and maintained by women, each lodge was circular with a dome-like roof and a square hole at the apex of the dome through which smoke could escape. Four pillars supported the frame of the lodge. Wood timbers were placed against these, and the exterior was covered with a matting made from reeds and twigs and then covered with hay and earth, which protected the interior from rain, heat and cold. It was sturdy enough so that numerous adults and children could sit on the top of the lodge. The lodge also featured an extended portico-type structure at the entrance, to provide protection from cold and other weather.Pritzker p. 336. The interior was constructed around four large pillars, upon which crossbeams supported the roof. These lodges were designed, built and owned by the women of the tribe, and ownership was passed through the female line. Generally in diameter, they could hold several families, up to 30 or 40 people, who were related through the elder women. When a young man married, he moved to his wife's lodge, which she shared with her mother and sisters. Villages usually had around 120 lodges. Reconstructions of these lodges may be seen at Fort Abraham Lincoln State Park near Mandan, North Dakota, and the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site. Originally lodges were rectangular, but around 1500 CE, lodges began to be constructed in a circular form. Toward the end of the 19th century, the Mandan began constructing small log cabins, usually with two rooms. When traveling or hunting, the Mandan would use skin tipis.Zimmerman pp. 298‚Äì299. Today, the Mandan live in modern dwellings. Villages were usually oriented around a central plaza that was used for games (chunkey) and ceremonial purposes. In the center of the plaza was a cedar tree surrounded by a vertical wood enclosure. The shrine represented the \\"Lone Man\\", one of the main figures in Mandan religion. He was said to have built a wooden corral that saved the people of a village from a flooding river in North Dakota.Bowers 161‚Äì162 Villages were often situated on high bluffs above the river. Often, villages would be constructed at the meeting of tributaries, in order to use the water as a natural barrier. Where there were few or no natural barriers, the villages built some type of fortification, including ditches and wooden palisades. =Family life= \\"The interior of the hut of a Mandan Chief\\": aquatint by Karl Bodmer from the book \\"Maximilian, Prince of Wied's Travels in the Interior of North America, during the years 1832‚Äì1834\\" The Mandan were originally divided into thirteen clans, which were reduced to seven by 1781, due to population losses in the smallpox epidemic. Ninety percent of the population died in the 1837-1838 smallpox epidemic. By 1950 only four clans survived. Historically clans organized around successful hunters and their kin. Each clan was expected to care for its own, including orphans and the elderly, from birth to death. The dead were traditionally cared for by their father's clan. Clans held a sacred or medicine bundle, which consisted of a few gathered objects believed to hold sacred powers. Those in possession of the bundles were considered to have sacred powers bestowed to them by the spirits and thus were considered the leaders of the clan and tribe. In historic times, the medicine bundles could be purchased, along with knowledge of the rites and rights associated with them, and then inherited by offspring. Children were named ten days after their birth in a ceremony that officially linked the child with its family and clan. Girls were taught domestic skills, especially cultivation and processing of maize and other plants, preparation, tanning and processing of skins and meats, needlework and quillwork, and how to build and keep a home. Boys were taught hunting and fishing. The boys began fasting for religious visions at the age of ten or eleven. Marriage among the Mandan was generally arranged by members of one's own clan, especially uncles; although, occasionally it would take place without the approval of the couple's parents. Divorce could be easily obtained. Upon the death of a family member, the father and his people would erect a scaffold near the village to contain the body. The body would be placed with the head toward the northwest and feet to the southeast. Southeast is the direction of the Ohio River Valley, from which the Mandan came. The Mandan would not sleep in this orientation, because it invited death. After a ceremony to send the spirit away, the family would mourn at the scaffold for four days. After the body rotted and the scaffold collapsed, the bones would be gathered up and buried, except for the skull, which was placed in a circle near the village. Family members would visit the skulls and talk to them, sometimes bearing their problems or regaling the dead with jokes. After the Mandan moved to the Fort Berthold Reservation, they resorted to placing the bodies in boxes or trunks, or wrapped them in fur robes and placed them in rocky crevices. = Mandan economy = Mandan food came from farming, hunting, gathering wild plants, and trade. Corn was the primary crop, and part of the surplus was traded with nomadic tribes for bison meat. Mandan gardens were often located near river banks, where annual flooding would leave the most fertile soil, sometimes in locations miles from villages. Women owned and tended the gardens, where they planted several varieties of corn, beans and squash. Sunflowers were planted first in early April.Elizabeth Fenn: Encounters at the Heart of the World: a History of the Mandan People As early as the fifteenth century, the Mandan town Huff had enough storage pits to store seventy thousand bushels of corn. Hunting the buffalo was a critical part of Mandan survival and rituals. They called the buffalo to \\"come to the village\\" in the Buffalo Dance ceremony at the beginning of each summer. In addition to eating the meat, the Mandan used all parts of the buffalo, so nothing went to waste. 'Float bison', which accidentally fell or were driven into the river, were considered a Mandan delicacy and the meat was eaten when half-rotten. The hides were used for buffalo-fur robes or were tanned, and the leather used for clothing, bags, shelter and other uses. The Mandan were known for their painted buffalo hides that often recorded historic events. The bones would be carved into items such as needles and fish hooks. Bones were also used in farming: for instance, the scapula was used as a hoe-like device for breaking the soil. The Mandan also trapped small mammals for food and hunted deer. Deer antlers were used to create rake-like implements used in farming. Birds were hunted for meat and feathers, the latter used for adornment. Archaeological evidence shows that the Mandan also ate fish. The Mandan and neighboring Hidatsa villages were key centers of trade on the Northern plains. The Mandan sometimes traded far from home but more often nomadic plains peoples travelled to the upper Missouri villages to trade. For example William Clark in the winter of 1804 documented the arrival of thousands of Assiniboine Indians as well as Cree and Cheyenne to trade. The Mandan bartered corn in exchange for dried bison meat. The Mandan also exchanged horses with the Assiniboine in exchange for arms, ammunition and European products. Clark noted that the Mandan obtained horses and leather tents from peoples to the west and southwest such as Crows, Cheyennes, Kiowas and Arapahos. =Dress= Crow's Heart, a Mandan, wearing a traditional deerhide tunic, photo by Edward Curtis, ca. 1908 Mandan girls gathering berries, photo by Edward Curtis, ca. 1908 Up until the late 19th century, when Mandan people began adopting Western-style dress, they commonly wore clothing made from the hides of buffalo, as well as of deer and sheep. From the hides, tunics, dresses, buffalo-fur robes, moccasins, gloves, loincloths and leggings could be made. These items were often ornamented with quills and bird feathers, and men sometimes wore the scalps of enemies. Mandan women wore ankle-length dresses made of deerskin or sheepskin. This would often be girded at the waist with a wide belt. Sometimes the hem of the dress would be ornamented with pieces of buffalo hoof. Underneath the dress, they wore leather leggings with ankle-high moccasins. Women's hair was worn straight down in braids. During the winter months, men would commonly wear deerskin tunics and leggings with moccasins. They also kept themselves warm by wearing a robe of buffalo fur. During the summer months, however, they often wore only a loincloth of deerskin or sheepskin. Unlike the women, men would wear various ornaments in their hair. The hair was parted across the top with three sections hanging down in front. Sometimes the hair would hang down the nose and would be curled upwards with a curling stick. The hair would hang to the shoulders on the side, and the back portion would sometimes reach to the waist. The long hair in the back would create a tail-like feature, as it would be gathered into braids then smeared with clay and spruce gum, and tied with cords of deerskin. Headdresses of feathers were often worn as well.Zimmerman pp. 299-300. Besides buffalo, elk, and deer hides, the Mandan also used ermine and white weasel hides for clothing.Pritzker 337 Today, Mandan people wear traditionally inspired clothing and regalia at powwows, ceremonies, and other significant events. =Religion= The okipa ceremony as witnessed by George Catlin, circa 1835. The Mandan's religion and cosmology was highly complex and centered around the figure known as Lone Man. Lone Man was involved in many of the creation myths as well as one of the flood myths. In their creation myth, the world was created by two rival deities, the First Creator and the Lone Man. The Missouri River divided the two worlds that the beings created. First Creator created the lands to the south of the river with hills, valleys, trees, buffalo, pronghorn antelope and snakes. To the north of the river, Lone Man created the Great Plains, domesticated animals, birds, fish and humans. The first humans lived underground near a large lake. Some of the more adventurous humans climbed a grapevine to the surface and discovered the two worlds. After returning underground, they shared their findings and decided to return with many others. As they were climbing the grapevine, it broke and half the Mandan were left underground.\\"Mandan Creation Myth.\\" Native Languages. (retrieved 24 Aug 2011) According to Mandan beliefs, each person possessed four different, immortal souls. The first soul was white and often seen as a shooting star or meteor. The second soul was colored a light brown and was seen in the form of the meadowlark. The third soul, called the lodge spirit, remained at the site of the lodge after death and would remain there forever. The final soul was black and after death would travel away from the village. These final souls existed as did living people; residing in their own villages, and farming and hunting. The Okipa ceremony was a major part of Mandan religious life. This complex ceremony related to the creation of the earth was first recorded by George Catlin. A man would volunteer to be the Okipa Maker, and sponsor the preparations and foods needed. Preparations took much of a year, as there were days of events, when crowds were hosted. The ceremony opened with a Bison Dance, to call the buffalo to the people. It was followed by a variety of torturous ordeals through which warriors proved their physical courage and gained the approval of the spirits. The Okipa began with the young men not eating, drinking, or sleeping for four days. Then they were led to a hut, where they had to sit with smiling faces while the skin of their chest and shoulders was slit and wooden skewers were thrust behind the muscles. With the skewers tied to ropes and supporting the weight of their bodies, the warriors would be suspended from the roof of the lodge and would hang there until they fainted. To add agony, heavy weights or buffalo skulls were added to the initiates' legs. After fainting, the warriors would be pulled down and the men (women were not allowed to attend this ceremony) would watch them until they awoke, proving the spirits' approval. Upon awakening, the warriors would offer the left little finger to the Great Spirit, whereupon a masked tribesman would sever it with a hatchet blow. Finally, participants would endure a grueling race around the village called \\"the last race\\", until the thongs tied to the buffalo skulls ripped out of their skin. Those finishing the ceremony were seen as being honored by the spirits; those completing the ceremony twice would gain everlasting fame among the tribe. Chief Four Bears, or Ma-to-toh- pe, completed this ceremony twice.Jahoda pp. 177‚Äì182. The last Okipa ceremony was performed in 1889, but the ceremony was resurrected in a somewhat different form in 1983. The version of the Okipa as practiced by the Lakota may be seen in the 1970 film A Man Called Horse starring Richard Harris. =Present day= The Mandan and the two culturally related tribes, the Hidatsa (Siouan) and Arikara (Caddoan), while being combined have intermarried but do maintain, as a whole, the varied traditions of their ancestors. The tribal residents have recovered from the trauma of their displacement in the 1950s. They constructed the Four Bears Casino and Lodge in 1993, attracting tourists and generating gaming and employment income for the impoverished reservation. The most recent addition to the New Town area has been the new Four Bears Bridge, which was built in a joint effort between the three tribes and the North Dakota Department of Transportation. The bridge, spanning the Missouri River, replaces an older Four Bears Bridge that was built in 1955. The new bridge--the largest bridge in the state of North Dakota--is decorated with medallions celebrating the cultures of the three tribes. The bridge was opened to traffic September 2, 2005, and was officially opened in a ceremony on October 3.

He has a PhD in anthropology from the Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis and has MA in Creative Writing for Film and Television at The University of Sheffield. He is a Voting member of the European Film Academy. Biography He described his childhood living with his mother and grandmother in Titoist Yugoslavia, in two novels. The protagonist of the 2002 novel King of the Rattling Spirits (based on his 2001 Sweet Dreams film script) is 12 years old and in the 2015 novel Childhood the protagonist is five. His first novel Crumbs (American title The Cartier Project) was set in his hometown of Jesenice and published in 1989 and sold 54,000 copies. It won the government award for the best novel of the year and Mazzini won the award for excellent artistic achievement by a young writer, given by the opposition. That was highly unusual for the times when Yugoslavia started slowly breaking apart.https://www.theskinny.co.uk/books/features/a-literature-of-independence- miha-mazzini He was the first Slovenian writer to write a novel about the erased, people that lost all of their rights and legal status after the declaration of the country's independence in 1991. Later he adapted the novel for the feature film Erased. His historical novel Paloma Negra was dealing with Yu-Mex music in 1950's, when Yugoslav singers started mimicking the songs and music they've seen in Mexican films. During the research for the novel, Mazzini recorded the stories told by protagonists and made a documentary called Yugoslav Mexico (YuMex)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5696478/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_2. The novel German Lottery is set in the same era but deals with swindlers, illusions and unreliable protagonists.

It usually manifests in three stages. The early (prodromal) stage is marked by airway inflammation; almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. The second stage is characterized by abnormally high numbers of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia), which causes tissue damage, most commonly to the lungs and the digestive tract. The third stage consists of vasculitis, which can eventually lead to cell death and can be life-threatening. This condition is now called \\"eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis\\" to remove all eponyms from the vasculitides. To facilitate the transition, it was referred to as \\"eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg‚ÄìStrauss)\\" for a period of time starting in 2012. Prior to this it was known as \\"Churg‚ÄìStrauss syndrome\\", named after Drs. Jacob Churg and Lotte Strauss who, in 1951, first published about the syndrome using the term \\"allergic granulomatosis\\" to describe it. It is a type of systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Effective treatment of EGPA requires suppression of the immune system with medication. This is typically glucocorticoids, followed by other agents such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.  Signs and symptoms  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis consists of three stages, but not all patients develop all three stages or progress from one stage to the next in the same order; whereas some patients may develop severe or life-threatening complications such as gastrointestinal involvement and heart disease, some patients are only mildly affected, e.g. with skin lesions and nasal polyps. EGPA is consequently considered a highly variable condition in terms of its presentation and its course. = Allergic stage = The prodromal stage is characterized by allergy. Almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis, with more than 90% having a history of asthma that is either a new development, or the worsening of pre-existing asthma, which may require systemic corticosteroid treatment. On average, asthma develops from three to nine years before the other signs and symptoms. The allergic rhinitis may produce symptoms such as rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, and the formation of nasal polyps that require surgical removal, often more than once. Sinusitis may also be present. = Eosinophilic stage = The second stage is characterized by an abnormally high level of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood and tissues. The symptoms of hypereosinophilia depend on which part of the body is affected, but most often it affects the lungs and digestive tract. The signs and symptoms of hypereosinophilia may include weight loss, night sweats, asthma, cough, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Fever and malaise are often present. The eosinophilic stage can last months or years, and its symptoms can disappear, only to return later. Patients may experience the third stage simultaneously. = Vasculitic stage = The third and final stage, and hallmark of EGPA, is inflammation of the blood vessels, and the consequent reduction of blood flow to various organs and tissues. Local and systemic symptoms become more widespread and are compounded by new symptoms from the vasculitis. Severe complications may arise. Blood clots may develop within the damaged arteries in severe cases, particularly in arteries of the abdominal region, which is followed by infarction and cell death, or slow atrophy. Many patients experience severe abdominal complaints; these are most often due to peritonitis and/or ulcerations and perforations of the gastrointestinal tract, but occasionally due to acalculous cholecystitis or granulomatous appendicitis. The most serious complication of the vasculitic stage is heart disease, which is the cause of nearly one-half of all deaths in patients with EGPA. Among heart disease-related deaths, the most usual cause is inflammation of the heart muscle caused by the high level of eosinophils, although some are deaths due to inflammation of the arteries that supply blood to the heart or pericardial tamponade. Kidney complications have been reported as being less common.  Diagnosis  Diagnostic markers include eosinophil granulocytes and granulomas in affected tissue, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) against neutrophil granulocytes. The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for diagnosis of Churg‚ÄìStrauss syndrome lists these criteria: *Asthma *Eosinophilia, i.e. eosinophil blood count greater than 500/microliter, or hypereosinophilia, i.e. eosinophil blood count greater than 1,500/microliter *Presence of mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy *Unfixed pulmonary infiltrates *Presence of paranasal sinus abnormalities *Histological evidence of extravascular eosinophils For classification purposes, a patient shall be said to have EGPA if at least four of these six criteria are positive. The presence of any four or more of the six criteria yields a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.7%. =Risk stratification= The French Vasculitis Study Group has developed a five-point system (\\"five-factor score\\") that predicts the risk of death in Churg‚ÄìStrauss syndrome using clinical presentations. These factors are: *Reduced renal function (creatinine >1.58 mg/dl or 140 ¬µmol/l) *Proteinuria (>1 g/24h) *Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, infarction, or pancreatitis *Involvement of the central nervous system *Cardiomyopathy The lack of any of these factors indicates milder case, with a five-year mortality rate of 11.9%. The presence of one factor indicates severe disease, with a five-year mortality rate of 26%, and two or more indicate very severe disease: 46% five-year mortality rate.  Treatment  Treatment for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis includes glucocorticoids (such as prednisolone) and other immunosuppressive drugs (such as azathioprine and cyclophosphamide). In many cases, the disease can be put into a type of chemical remission through drug therapy, but the disease is chronic and lifelong. A systematic review conducted in 2007 indicated all patients should be treated with high-dose steroids, but in patients with a five-factor score of one or higher, cyclophosphamide pulse therapy should be commenced, with 12 pulses leading to fewer relapses than six. Remission can be maintained with a less toxic drug, such as azathioprine or methotrexate. On December 12, 2017, the FDA approved mepolizumab, the first drug therapy specifically indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Patients taking mepolizumab experienced a \\"significant improvement\\" in their symptoms.  History  Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis was first described by pathologists Jacob Churg (1910‚Äì2005) and Lotte Strauss (1913‚Äì1985) at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City in 1951, using the term \\"allergic granulomatosis\\" to describe it. They reported \\"fever...hypereosinophilia, symptoms of cardiac failure, renal damage, and peripheral neuropathy, resulting from vascular embarrassment in various systems of organs\\" in a series of 13 patients with necrotizing vasculitis previously diagnosed as \\"periarteritis nodosa\\", accompanied by hypereosinophilia and severe asthma. Drs. Churg and Strauss noted three features which distinguished their patients from other patients with periarteritis nodosa but without asthma: necrotizing vasculitis, tissue eosinophilia, and extravascular granuloma. As a result, they proposed that these cases were evident of a different disease entity, which they referred to as \\"allergic granulomatosis and angiitis\\".  Society and culture  The memoir Patient, by musician Ben Watt, deals with his experience with EGPA in 1992, and his recovery. Watt's case was unusual in that it mainly affected his gastrointestinal tract, leaving his lungs largely unaffected; this unusual presentation contributed to a delay in proper diagnosis. His treatment required the removal of 5 m (15 ft) of necrotized small intestine (about 75%), leaving him on a permanently restricted diet. Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, the president of Nigeria from 2007 to 2010, reportedly had EGPA and died in office of complications of the disease. DJ and author Charlie Gillett was diagnosed with EGPA in 2006; he died four years later. Japanese ski jumper Taku Takeuchi, who won the bronze medal in the team competition, has the disease and competed at the Sochi Olympics less than a month after being released from hospital treatment. New Zealand reporter and television presenter Toni Street was diagnosed with the condition in 2015. Street has had health problems for several years, including removal of her gallbladder four months prior. Willie Naulls died on November 22, 2018 in Laguna Niguel, California, from respiratory failure due to EGPA, which he had been battling for eight years.

It was used by United States Air Force after World War II and returned to the German government in 1957 and used as a base for the modern German Air Force ever since. The air force base was the site of the Munich Massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics. The nine Israeli hostages (two had been killed earlier at the Olympic Village) and eight Black September terrorists who captured them were flown to the base from the Olympic Village via helicopter, where the terrorists demanded they, and their hostages, be flown to a friendly Arab nation. After a botched rescue attempt by Bavarian border guards and Munich police, the terrorists killed all of the nine remaining Israeli hostages, who were unable to escape from the helicopters. Five of the terrorists and a Munich policeman were also killed in the gunfight.

Created during 1936 as one of seven nationalised aeronautical manufacturing companies, SNCASO became a key French aircraft manufacturer following the end of the Second World War. It produced numerous innovation aircraft; amongst the company's more notable projects was the first French jet aircraft, the Sud- Ouest Triton, and the first indigenously-developed French helicopter, the Sud- Ouest Djinn. On 1 March 1957, SNCASO merged with another French nationalised aviation company, SNCASE, (Soci√©t√© nationale de constructions a√©ronautiques du sud-est), to form Sud Aviation. History Following the resolution of the 1936 general strike of French heavy industry, the government of L√©on Blum introduced an act to nationalize the French war industry. The act provided for the creation of seven nationalised aeronautical manufacturing companies: six for aircraft (SNCASE, SNCASO, SNCAN, SNCAO, SNCAM, SNCAC), and one for aircraft engines (SNCM - Lorraine-Dietrich). In accordance with this agreement, SNCASO was formed on 16 November 1936 from the merger of the factories of Bl√©riot of Suresnes, Bloch of Villacoublay and Courbevoie, SASO (Soci√©t√© A√©ronautique du Sud-Ouest) of Bordeaux-M√©rignac, UCA (Usine de Construction A√©ronautique) of Bordeaux-B√®gles, Soci√©t√© A√©rienne Bordelaise (SAB) of Bordeaux-Bacalan and Lior√© et Olivier of Rochefort. Additionally, SNCASO constructed a new factory in D√©ols during that same year.\\"SNCASO.\\" Aviafrance. The company's fortunes, along with that of the wider French nation, were heavily affected by the events of the Second World War, particularly the formation of the occupation of France by German forces. Despite the country's hardship during the conflict, SNCASO continued to operate. During 1941, the Paris design bureaus of both the nationalized and the private aircraft firms were relocated; according to aviation historian G√©rard Hartmann, this measure was taken to avoid capture. That same year, SNCASO took over the assets of the ailing SNCAO. The company worked on various projects throughout the war, often under a heavy level of secrecy, including into the new field of jet propulsion. France, akin to the other Allied nations in the war, had benefitted from captured Germany high speed research; these factors combined gave a great impetus to undertaking advanced research projects.Caygill 2006, . SO.6000 Triton n¬∞3 Amongst the first new aviation projects to be launched in France during the postwar era was SNCASO's jet- powered Sud-Ouest Triton. According to aviation author John W.R. Taylor, the origins of the Triton can be traced back to a clandestine research effort conducted during 1943, headed by the French aeronautics engineer Lucien Servanty. Shortly after the end of the conflict, the new French government issued a requirement, calling for a total of five prototype aircraft to be constructed for testing purposes. The development of indigenously designed jet aircraft was seen as of national importance to the government, being intended to symbolise and embody the speedy recovery of France's industrial and military strength.\\"Vol historique du premier avion √† r√©action fran√ßais, le \\"SO 6000 Triton.\\" gouvernement.fr, Retrieved: 18 May 2019. To speed up development of the Triton, which would become the first French jet-powered aircraft to fly, it was decided to use the German-designed Junkers Jumo 004-B2 engine after severe development issues were encountered with the indigenously developed Rateau-Anxionnaz GTS-65 turbojet engine. The British Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine was also adopted for multiple of the prototypes. On 11 November 1946, the first prototype Triton performed its maiden flight. However, further development of the Triton was ultimately abandoned during the early 1950s; it was never use in any operational circumstance. The design had been rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of advancements, both in terms of jet propulsion specifically and wider aerospace capabilities generally, with numerous jet-powered designs being produced around this timeframe. SNCASO also branched out into helicopters. It gained useful experiences from the experimental Sud-Ouest Ariel, a tip jet helicopter, that enabled the firm's design team to pursue development of a practical light helicopter that would harness this technology. They designed a compact and lightweight twin-seat rotorcraft, which was promptly designated as the Sud-Ouest Djinn.Boyne 2011, p. 101. While this newer design did not share an identical tip jet system to the Ariel, the type did rely upon the same basic concept of feeding compressed air, which was generated by an onboard pump, to the tips of the vehicle's rotor blades to drive the movement of the blades.\\"Helicopter Runs On Air.\\" Popular Science, April 1953.\\"Hot Air Whirler\\" Flight, 18 December 1953. p. 8.Boyne 2011, p. 74. First flying on January 1953, the Djinn proved itself to be a viable design; after several further prototypes were completed and tested, the type went into mass production.McGowen 2005, p. 74. The Djinn was the first indigenously developed French helicopter, as well as being one of the first practical European helicopters to be produced.Boyne 2011, pp. 73‚Äì74. It was also the first tip-jet propelled rotorcraft to enter production.\\"Hew French Helicopters.\\" Flight International, 17 April 1959. p. 512. Almost immediately after the war, the resurgent French Air Force also produced a requirement for a jet bomber with a takeoff weight of roughly 25‚Äì30 tonnes and capable of flying at high-subsonic speeds; its development was viewed as a major technological challenge as it called for the production of France's first jet bomber.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 68. SNCASO was amongst several French aircraft manufacturers to tender, submitting its SO.4000; it received a development order for a pair of manned scale models and a full-sized prototype. During 1947, as a result of the rapid advances made in aviation technologies made around this time, plans for the SO.4000's production run were abandoned; nevertheless, it was decided to complete the two scale models and the full size prototype for experimental purposes.\\"Le Sud-Ouest SO-4000: V. Essai et abandon du SO-4000\\". Le Sit des Projets et Prototypes d'Avions, 14 May 2003. Retrieved 15 May 2011. Both scale models provided valuable data on features such as swept wings, pilot escape systems, spoiler control, and leading edge slats. On 5 March 1950, the SO.4000 was rolled out; by this point, it was already obsolete and lacking in capabilities compared to its contemporaries. Following an accident that damaged the airframe, work on the project was abandoned.Air International January 1986, p. 46. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the SO.4000 was a very heavy aircraft, which only compounded the weakness of possessing relatively little engine power, giving it an extremely poor thrust-to-weight ratio even when empty; they also criticised it as possessing \\"useless capabilities\\".Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 69. Vautour II N During June 1951, the French Arm√©e de l'Air (AdA) issued a separate requirement for a jet-powered aircraft capable of functioning as a bomber, a low-level attack aircraft, or an all-weather interceptor.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 124. In response, SNCASO adapted its existing S.O. 4000 design to perform the desired roles. During 1951, prototype testing had demonstrated promising performance for the type, which encouraged its further development.\\"IAF Aircraft Inventory: Sud-Ouest S.O. 4050 Vautour.\\" Jewish Virtual Library, Retrieved: 16 September 2017. Named the Vantour, the IIB bomber variant was used to carry France's nuclear weapons in addition to a conventional arsenal; as such, for some years the Vantour was an important element of the nation's nuclear deterrent. According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, \\"It would be fair to claim that in the early 1950s the Vautour was the most promising twin-jet warplane in Western Europe\\".Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 125. SNCASO developed several variants of the Vantour for different purposes, including the interceptor role; several were proposed but ultimately unbuilt. During 1956, two years prior to the Vautour even entering squadron service, France issued a more demanding requirement for a supersonic replacement aircraft. The Vautour was viewed as a stop-gap measure for the nuclear deterrent role, as its performance in this role was typically thought to be limited at best, while this more capable follow-on aircraft was under development. While the newer bomber requirement would ultimately result in the selection, development and manufacture of the Dassault Mirage IV bomber; SNCASO chose to respond to the requirement, producing their own proposal of an envisioned Super Vautour. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the unbuilt 'stretched' Super Vautour would have featured an increased combat radius of 1,700 miles as well as the ability to attain at least Mach 0.9.Gunston 1973, p. 104. During the rationalisation of the nationalised Aircraft Industry during the 1950s, SNCASO was merged with SNCASE to form Sud Aviation on 1 March 1957. Over the subsequent decades, Sud Aviation was in turn was amalgamated into French defense conglomerate A√©rospatiale and eventually became a part of the multinational EADS group, today trading as the Airbus Group.

Blunt sneaks off with Lucetta. = Act II = Willmore, Belvile, and Frederick go to see Angellica, a famous courtesan. Angellica's servants hang up a portrait of her outside of her house. The Englishmen are astounded by her beauty, but leave when they realise they do not have the money to buy her‚Äîone thousand crowns a month. Don Pedro enters and sees the picture and the price. He has the money and runs to fetch it. Angellica laments that no one has taken her up because of the high price, but when she learns of Don Pedro and Don Antonio, both of whom are rich, she decides to pursue them, then goes back inside. Pedro soon enters from one side of the stage, and Antonio enters from the other; both men are masked. Antonio is also struck by Angellica's portrait and wonders out loud if he could get away with sleeping with Angellica and still marry Florinda. At the mention of Florinda, Pedro recognizes Antonio. They fight. Willmore and Blunt enter and break them up. Pedro challenges Antonio to a duel the next day over Angellica. Antonio accepts. Meanwhile, Willmore sees a smaller picture of Angellica and tries to steal it. Antonio tells him to put it back. Willmore refuses and says that Antonio has the money to pay for the real thing. Angellica enters just in time to see another fight break out. Angellica asks Willmore to speak with her inside as she was initially very excited and impressed by him. Willmore goes, despite Belvile and Frederick's fears that Angellica is angry with him. Willmore tries to persuade Angellica to sleep with him for free. Normally Angellica would not agree to this, but she has fallen in love with Willmore, with his wits and his way. She agrees, despite the warnings from her maidservant Moretta. = Act III = Hellena says that she is not in love, but she cannot stop thinking about Willmore. The women see Belvile, Blunt, and Frederick approach, and eavesdrop on the men. Belvile, Blunt and Frederick have come to retrieve Willmore from Angellica because he has been inside with her for two hours. Willmore comes out and brags about having enjoyed Angellica's charms for free. Hellena, who has seen and heard everything Willmore said, comes out of hiding and pretends as if nothing has transpired. As Willmore begins to flirt with her again, Angellica enters, masked, and sees Willmore betraying the vows he made to her. Hellena finally reveals her face to Willmore, who praises her beauty. This is the last straw for Angellica. She orders one of her servants to find out who Hellena is and storms out. Hellena asks what Willmore was doing in Angellica's house; he denies that anything transpired. Hellena then attacks him, quoting to him what he had just said about Angellica. She makes Willmore promise never to see Angellica again. Meanwhile, Florinda and Valeria are testing Belvile's loyalty to Florinda by trying to seduce him while he doesn't know who they are. He stands firm. The women exit, but Florinda leaves Belvile with a locket. Belvile recognizes Florinda's picture in the locket and resolves to rescue her that night, with Willmore and Frederick's help. Meanwhile, Blunt is tricked out of his money and clothes by Lucetta. Florinda waits in her garden for Belvile wearing a nightgown. Willmore enters, drunk, mistakes Florinda for a prostitute, and tries to persuade her to sleep with him. When she resists he attempts to rape her, but when Belvile and Frederick enter, Florinda runs off. Willmore and Belvile almost fight, but Frederick intervenes. The noise however, brings Pedro and his servants to the garden. A fight breaks out and the English are driven off. Willmore tries to explain to a furious Belvile that he didn't know who Florinda was and mistook her for a whore. Belvile and Frederick leave to find Florinda. Antonio enters, hoping that his page has paid Angellica so he can sleep with her. Willmore sees this and starts a fight with Antonio. Antonio falls, wounded. Willmore believes he has killed Antonio and runs off. Belvile runs in, fearing that it is Willmore who has been hurt. Soldiers enter and arrest Belvile, believing him to be the attacker. Antonio finds his strength and orders Belvile taken to his house. =Act IV= Don Antonio does not believe that Belvile is innocent of having injured him; however, he offers Belvile an alternative to imprisonment. Since Antonio is wounded and cannot duel Pedro, Belvile could dress up as Antonio and go instead. Belvile agrees, believing the fight to be over Florinda. Florinda frets that Belvile did not come to her window as planned, and fears that the impending duel is between Belvile and Pedro. Pedro enters, masked, and reveals that he will be fighting Antonio, relieving some of Florinda's fears. Belvile enters, disguised as Antonio. Florinda runs in to stop them. Belvile is confused as to why Florinda would defend his rival but they push her away and fight. Florinda stops them again just as Belvile disarms Pedro. She begs him spare Pedro. Belvile lays his sword at Florinda's feet and swears his love to her. The action redeems him in Pedro's eyes, so he gives his sister to the man he believes to be Antonio, demanding that they get married at once. Florinda protests, but Belvile secretly lifts his mask to show her who he is. Just then, Willmore and Frederick enter. Wilmore greets him by embrace. The embrace makes Belvile drop his mask. Pedro now refuses to allow the wedding, since it was Antonio's fight, not Belvile's. He drags Florinda away, accusing her of trying to trick him. Belvile, furious at being thwarted yet again, turns on Willmore and chases him away. Angellica enters with her servants Moretta and Sebastian, furious that Willmore loves Hellena. Sebastian runs after Willmore to bring him back. Angellica accuses Willmore of having another woman. Willmore, as usual, attempts to charm her back. Hellena enters disguised as a man. She decides to interfere and approaches Angellica pretending to be one of Hellena's servants. She tells a story about a young girl who fell in love and was left standing at the altar because her lover came to Angellica. Then she reveals the lover to be Willmore. Angellica is moved by the story, Willmore is only excited and impatient to find out who the woman in question is. Suddenly, Willmore recognizes Hellena and figures out what's going on. He turns to Angellica and starts describing Hellena as a Gypsy, ugly, a monkey, etc. He tells Hellena to go back to her mistress. Angellica is outraged with Willmore and vows to take revenge and sends Willmore away. Willmore exits with an aside in which he says he plans to try to win Hellena back. Florinda and Valeria enter, disguised in different costumes, having momentarily escaped Pedro. Then Don Pedro, Belvile, and Willmore enter. Pedro and Belvile seem to be having a serious conversation. Willmore follows Florinda when she walks past, again thinking she is a courtesan. Frederick comes in and relates Blunt's misadventures to Belvile and Pedro. They all go off to find him. Florinda reenters, still being chased by Willmore. Then Hellena arrives and sees Willmore pursuing this \\"unknown\\" woman. She sends a page to find out where they go. Florinda ducks into a door to avoid Willmore; it turns out to be Belvile's house. The page Hellena sent goes off to relay the information. Blunt is staying in Belvile's house. Florinda enters, sees Blunt and asks him for help. Blunt then attempts to rape her based on his new contempt for women. Frederick enters, also convinced that Florinda is a prostitute, and joins Blunt. Florinda gives them a diamond ring and asks them to consult Belvile. Frederick fears that she might be a lady of some worth and asks Blunt to wait. Blunt is still sceptical but agrees. Frederick locks Florinda in a room. =Act V= Belvile, Willmore, Frederick, and Pedro break into Blunt's room and laugh at him. Blunt says that just a moment before there was a wench in his chamber and shows them the ring Florinda gave him. Belvile recognizes the ring as the one he gave Florinda when they exchanged vows. The other men, unaware that the girl is Florinda, decide to let her out and have their way with her. They draw swords to see who has the longest. Don Pedro wins and unlocks Florinda's door. Florinda runs in, still masked and pursued by Pedro. She is saved when Valeria arrives and persuades Pedro to leave by telling him that Callis knows where Florinda is hiding. Once he is gone, Florinda removes her mask. Valeria tells Belvile and Florinda to get married quickly, before Pedro returns. Frederick and Valeria decide to get married as well. Belvile sends a boy to fetch a priest. Frederick and Blunt realise that they almost raped Florinda and apologise, returning the ring. Florinda forgives them. Belvile, Florinda, Valeria, and Frederick exit to get married; Blunt goes off to see a tailor. Willmore stays behind to guard against Pedro's return. Angellica enters, pointing a pistol at Willmore; she rages at him while threatening him with the gun. Willmore offers to pay her for her services; she refuses. As she prepares to kill him, Don Antonio enters with his arm in a sling. He takes the gun from Angellica, then recognises Willmore as the man who stole Angellica's picture. He offers to shoot Willmore. Pedro enters. Angellica decides to let Willmore live, and leaves. Don Pedro asks why Don Antonio missed the duel; Antonio tells him what happened, and leaves in a huff. Pedro decides to give Florinda to Belvile in revenge. Willmore informs him that the marriage has already occurred. Pedro exits. Hellena enters, still in boy's clothes, and banters with Willmore, who wants to sleep with her but doesn't want to marry her. Hellena finally convinces him for marriage. Pedro, Belvile, Florinda, Frederick, and Valeria enter. They learn of Willmore and Hellena's engagement and Pedro approves, tired of fearing for his sister's honour (virginity). Blunt enters in a Spanish habit, looking ridiculous. Music plays and masquers from Carnival come in dancing. The play ends with vows of love between Hellena and Willmore. Background Having famously worked as a spy for Charles II against the Dutch, Behn lost her meagre income when the king refused to pay her expenses. She turned to writing for an income. Behn was a Royalist, and her works frequently portray Puritans negatively. The subtitle \\"Banish'd Cavaliers\\" is a reference to the exile that the Cavalier forces experienced during the English Interregnum. Reception The Rover premiered 1677 to such great success that Behn wrote a sequel that was produced in 1681. An extraordinarily popular example of Restoration comedy, the play earned an extended run, enabling Behn to make a fair income from it, receiving the proceeds from the box office every third night. Willmore (who may have been a parallel to Charles II or John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester) proved to be an extremely popular character, and four years later Behn wrote a sequel to the play. King Charles II was himself a fan of The Rover, and received a private showing of the play. Critic Susan Carlson argues that despite much of Behn's work facing harsh criticism, The Rover was \\"perhaps the least tarnished by critical contention over the originality of her work\\". The play was later adapted by Mr. John Phillip Kemble in 1790 in a production called Love in Many Masks. Kemble's version featured three acts instead of the normal five. This was not the only abbreviation applied to Behn's original work. The final cut of Kemble's piece saw most of the plot that was pertaining to sex, removed. Hellena's speech on rape and unwanted marriage was left out, and the part of the plot relating to the near rape of Florinda by Willmore is only implied. Even though this version of Aphra Behn's The Rover was much more polite and politically correct, it still received criticism that \\"the ideas are constantly indelicate, and the language frequently gross.\\" This resembled the reception that Behn's Rover received as well, and resulted in The Rover disappearing from the stage until the late 1970s. Literary criticism Behn has been credited with an improvement in Killigrew's \\"indulgent and inert\\" dialogue in the third act of the play. Derek Hughes and Janet Todd critiqued the play in The Cambridge Companion to Aphra Behn.

In its profound form it is automatic and effortless. It is one of the echophenomena, closely related to echopraxia, the automatic repetition of movements made by another person; both are \\"subsets of imitative behavior\\" whereby sounds or actions are imitated \\"without explicit awareness\\". Echolalia may be an immediate reaction to a stimulus or may be delayed. Echolalia occurs in many cases of autism spectrum disorder and Tourette syndrome. It may also occur in several other neurological conditions such as some forms of dementia or stroke-related aphasia. The word \\"echolalia\\" is derived from the Greek , meaning \\"echo\\" or \\"to repeat\\", and (lali√°) meaning \\"speech\\" or \\"talk\\" (of onomatopoeic origin, from the verb (lal√©o), meaning \\"to talk\\"). Signs and symptoms Echolalia can be categorized as immediate (occurring immediately after the stimulus) vs. delayed (some time after the occurrence of a stimulus). Immediate echolalia results from quick recall of information from the short-term memory and \\"superficial linguistic processing\\". A typical pediatric presentation of immediate echolalia might be as follows: a child is asked \\"Do you want dinner?\\"; the child echoes back \\"Do you want dinner?\\", followed by a pause, and then a response, \\"Yes. What's for dinner?\\"Bashe, P. R. The OASIS Guide to Asperger Syndrome; Advice, Support, Insight, and Inspiration. Crown Publishers, 2001, p. 22. In delayed echolalia the patient repeats words, phrases, or multiple sentences after a delay that can be anywhere from hours to years later. Immediate echolalia can be indicative that a developmental disorder exists, but this is not necessarily the case. Sometimes echolalia can be observed when an individual echoes back a statement to indicate they are contemplating a response and fully heard the original statement. Researchers observed the daily repetitions of an autistic six-year- old in order to examine the differences between triggers for delayed versus immediate echolalia. Researchers further distinguished immediate echos by the sequential context in which they occur: after corrections, after directives, or in indiscernible sequential positions. Delayed echos are distinguished on the basis of ownership: self-echos, other-echos, and impersonal echos. The results showed that nearly all immediate echos produced by the six-year-old were found in sequential contexts, while the delayed echoes also occurred in the basis of ownership. Although echolalia can be an impairment, the symptoms can involve a large selection of underlying meanings and behaviors across and within subjects. Mitigated echolalia refers to a repetition in which the original stimulus is somewhat altered, and ambient echolalia refers to the repetition (typically occurring in individuals with dementia) of environmental stimuli such as a television program running in the background. Examples of mitigated echolalia are pronoun changes or syntax corrections. The first can be seen in the example of asking the patient ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù and with patient responding ‚ÄúWhere am I going?‚Äù The latter would be seen in the clinician asking ‚ÄúWhere are I going?‚Äù and the patient repeating ‚ÄúWhere am I going?‚Äù In mitigated echolalia some language processing is occurring. Mitigated echolalia can be seen in dyspraxia and aphasia of speech. A Japanese case report describes a 20-year-old college student who was admitted to the hospital complaining about headaches and meningitis; however, he also exhibited signs of ambient echolalia. The researchers stated that the young patient's repetition was occurring at approximately the same tempo as his normal speech rate. The patient did not simply repeat words he had heard one after another. The patient reported that his ambient echolalia appeared to be random but appeared when he was distracted. He was also aware of his echolalia, but said he is unable to stop the repetitions. Associated disorders Echolalia can be an indicator of communication disorders in autism, but is neither unique to, nor synonymous with syndromes. Echophenomena (particularly echolalia and echopraxia) were defining characteristics in the early descriptions of Tourette syndrome (TS). Echolalia also occurs in aphasia, schizophrenia, dementia, catatonia, epilepsy, after cerebral infarction (stroke), closed head injury, in blind children, children with language impairments, as well as certain developing neurotypical children. Other disorders associated with echolalia are Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, as well as pervasive developmental disorder. In transcortical sensory aphasia, echolalia is common, with the patient incorporating another person's words or sentences into his or her own response. While these patients lack language comprehension, they are still able to read.  Anatomical correlates  Echolalia can be the result of left hemisphere damage. In specific damage to the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere has been linked to effortful echolalia. Cases of echolalia have appeared after lesions of the left medial frontal lobe and supplemental motor areas. Unintentional or nonfunctional echolalia shows similarities to imitation behavior seen after disinhibition of the frontal network is most likely related to mirror neurons. In cases where echolalia is a part of mixed transitory aphasia the perisylvian language area remains intact, but the surrounding anterior and posterior association cortexes suffer from infarction or degeneration.  Imitation and learning  Echolalia is common in young children who are first learning to speak. Echolalia is a form of imitation. Imitation is a useful, normal and necessary component of social learning: imitative learning occurs when the \\"observer acquires new behaviors through imitation\\" and mimicry or automatic imitation occurs when a \\"reenacted behavior is based on previously acquired motor (or vocal) patterns\\". Ganos et al (2012) define echolalia as an \\"automatic imitative action without explicit awareness\\". Children often first babble syllables and eventually words they hear. For example, a baby may often hear the word ‚Äúbottle‚Äù in various sentences. The baby first repeats with only syllables such as ‚Äúbaba‚Äù but as their language skills progress the child will eventually be able to say the word ‚Äúbottle‚Äù. Echolalia becomes less and less common as a child‚Äôs language skills develop. It is not possible to distinguish the imitative learning form of echolalia that occurs as part of normal development from automatic imitation or echolalia characteristic of a disorder until about the age of three, when some ability for self-regulation is developed. A disorder may be suspected if automatic imitation persists beyond the age of three. Function In the past, echolalia was regarded as negative, non-functional behavior. However, researchers such as Barry Prizant and colleagues have emphasized the communicative function of echolalia. Among the communicative functions noted are turntaking, requesting, self-regulation and rehearsal to aid comprehension. Echolalia can be categorized as communicative (in context and with \\"apparent communicative purpose\\") vs. semicommunicative (an \\"unclear communicative meaning\\"). The use of echolalia in task response to facilitate generalization is an area that holds much promise. Research in this area is certainly needed. Marjorie H. Charlop performed a series of task experiments with autistic children. The results suggest that perhaps in certain tasks (i.e., receptive labeling), echolalia should not be eliminated, but taken advantage of as it may facilitate acquisition and generalization for autistic children. = Tourette syndrome = Echolalia and echopraxia are distinguishing tics of Tourette syndrome (TS); the echolalic repetitions of individuals with TS are mainly echoes from within their own \\"tic repertoire\\". Evidence points to a healthy mirror neuron system (MNS) but \\"inadequate imitation-control mechanism, which make them vulnerable to interferences\\". = Autism = It is estimated that up to 75% of people on the autism spectrum have exhibited echolalia. A symptom of some children with ASD is the struggle to produce spontaneous speech. Studies have shown that in some cases echolalia is used as a coping mechanism allowing an autistic person to contribute to a conversation when unable to produce spontaneous speech. Studies in the 1980s showed that there may be communicative intent with delayed echolalia, \\"depending on the context in which it occurs\\"; this research on autistic children \\"raised questions related to behavior modification programs that defended the revocation or replacement of immediate echolalia\\". Uta Frith, Prizant and others have interpreted echolalia as evidence of \\"gestalt\\" processing in autistic children, including in the acquisition of language. However, a 1990 study on the acquisition of grammar by Tager-Flusberg and Calkins found that echolalia did not facilitate grammatical development in autistic children.

He served as a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts and was one of the first two U.S. Senators from Maine. Holmes was noted for his involvement in the Treaty of Ghent. Biography Holmes was born in Kingston in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, and attended public schools in Kingston. In 1796, he graduated from the College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (the former name of Brown University) in Providence, Rhode Island. Holmes studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1799, opening a law practice in Alfred in Massachusetts' District of Maine. At this time, he was also engaged in literary pursuits. Career This is the first page of a two-page letter written to Holmes by Thomas Jefferson on April 22, 1820. Holmes, a Democratic- Republican, was elected to the Massachusetts General Court in 1802, 1803, and 1812. He was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1813 and 1814. In 1816, Holmes was one of the commissioners under the Treaty of Ghent to divide the islands of Passamaquoddy Bay between the United States and Great Britain. He was also appointed by the legislature to organize state prisons and revise the Massachusetts criminal code. Holmes was elected as a United States Representative from Massachusetts in 1816, serving from March 4, 1817, to his resignation on March 15, 1820. During the 16th Congress, Holmes served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of State. Holmes supported William H. Crawford, (a \\"Crawford Republican\\"), and John Quincy Adams. He was opposed to Andrew Jackson (an \\"Anti-Jackson\\"). Holmes supported the Missouri Compromise, and was praised by Thomas Jefferson for his pamphlet Mr. Holmes's Letter to the People of Maine. In the letter, Jefferson thanks Holmes for a copy of this pamphlet. This pamphlet defends Holmes's position on supporting the Missouri Compromise‚Äîthe admission of Maine as a free state with the admission of Missouri as a slave state, which was an unpopular position in Maine. This letter is also notable for being the first written attestation of the phrase \\"to have the wolf by the ear\\". Jefferson himself rejected the compromise: > But this momentous question, like a fire bell in the night, awakened and > filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell of the Union. it > is hushed indeed for the moment. but this is a reprieve only, not a final > sentence. a geographical line, coinciding with a marked principle, moral and > political, once conceived and held up to the angry passions of men, will > never be obliterated; and every new irritation will mark it deeper and > deeper. (...) An abstinence too from this act of power would remove the > jealousy excited by the undertaking of Congress, to regulate the condition > of the different descriptions of men composing a state. this certainly is > the exclusive right of every state, which nothing in the constitution has > taken from them and given to the general government. could congress, for > example say that the Non-freemen of Connecticut, shall be freemen, or that > they shall not emigrate into any other state? :‚Äî Letter by Thomas Jefferson > to John Holmes, April 22, 1820 Holmes was later a delegate to the Maine Constitutional Convention. Upon separation from Massachusetts and the admission of Maine as a state, he was elected to the United States Senate and served from June 13, 1820, to March 3, 1827. Holmes was again elected to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Albion Parris, serving from January 15, 1829, to March 3, 1833. During the 17th Congress, Holmes served as chairman of the Committee on Finance (1821‚Äì1822); during the 21st Congress, Holmes was chairman of the Committee on Pensions. After leaving the Senate, Holmes resumed his law practice. From 1836 to 1837, he was a member of the Maine House of Representatives. In 1841, Holmes was appointed as the United States Attorney for the District of Maine, a post he held until his death in Portland on July 7, 1843. Death and legacy Holmes was interred in a private tomb of Cotton Brooks, Eastern Cemetery. In 1840, Holmes published The Statesman, Or Principles of Legislation and Law, a law book.

Recorded in late 1997 following a tumultuous year for the group, Tin Planet was a continuation of the eclectic blend of musical styles explored on their debut album Spiders. However, it was noted that the more abrasive aspects of their sound were toned down considerably from their debut, with the songs being more melodic with a prominent cabaret and easy listening influence. Keyboardist Franny Griffiths' love of techno and electronic music was also brought to the fore, culminating in three tracks that were primarily dance-orientated. The album was the first Space record to feature long-time collaborator David \\"Yorkie\\" Palmer as full-time bassist, and the last to feature founding member Andy Parle on drums (though he was not credited in the album's liner notes), with Leon Caffrey taking his place shortly afterwards. Tin Planet peaked at #3 in the UK charts, two places higher than Spiders. It was their first album to enter the Australian ARIA top 100 albums chart, debuting on 24 May 1998 and peaking at #74 the following week. The album peaked at #11 in New Zealand in May 1998. The songs \\"Avenging Angels\\", \\"The Ballad of Tom Jones\\" (a duet with Cerys Matthews of the band Catatonia), \\"Begin Again\\" and \\"Bad Days\\" were released as singles, all hitting the UK top 40. Background In 1996, Space released their debut album Spiders on Gut Records. Combining surreal, darkly humorous lyrics and a large number of styles and genres, including rock, techno, hip hop and funk, a result of the different musical tastes of the band members, the album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number 5 on the UK Albums Chart and becoming certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry in December 1996 for sales of over 300,000. Nonetheless, in mid-1997, during their tour of the United States, where the band began to find minor success, numerous personal problems hit the band. The band were constantly under stress, which reached such an extent that keyboardist Franny Griffiths developed an ulcer, lyricist and vocalist Tommy Scott lost his voice and the band's guitarist and other lyricist and vocalist, Jamie Murphy, \\"still only 21, simply lost it completely and had a spell in psychiatric care being fed anti-depressants and milk.\\" Murphy ultimately missed many of the band's live shows and television appearances. Though widely rumoured to have depressingly watched Space perform \\"Dark Clouds\\" on BBC's Top of the Pops on television, one of the performances he missed, he was in fact preoccupied with other things and \\"actually forgotten the single was even out.\\" Scott was terrified that his singing voice was permanently lost, as the cause with originally unknown; he underwent cancer treatment to make sure, but it turns out his voice was lost due to stress, and he soon recovered. Murphy also soon recovered and rejoined the band in time for the recording of Tin Planet. Scott explained, \\"Me losing my voice turned out to be the best thing because everyone had two months off so everyone got their heads together. Jamie got better and then everything happened naturally. I went to see Jamie and he was all right - a lot better - so we forgave him.\\" However, throughout the writing and recording of the album, the band felt they were of an uncertain future and were in a darker environment than before. In late 1997, just prior to the recording of Tin Planet, the band's old friend, Dave \\"Yorkie\\" Palmer, joined the group. He has already contributed backing to vocals on \\"Neighbourhood\\", one of the band's biggest hits from Spiders, and was involved in the production of several of the album's B-sides, but he was asked to join the band proper as their full- time bassist, which allowed Scott to focus on his vocals. However, shortly after joining the band, the death of his mother Gladys Palmer, a Liverpudlian singer who owned the rehearsal rooms Space practised in, came as a devastation to the group. Her death brought a \\"tinge of sadness\\" to the recording sessions. Recording A Fender Coronado, similar to the model Tommy Scott played on the album. The band recorded Tin Planet in late 1997 and early 1998 at Parr Street Studios, Liverpool, the same studio that they recorded Spiders in. The album was also mixed and mastered at the studio. Although Murphy had rejoined the band, he was often distracted by other occurrences, and Scott in fact played a majority of the guitars present on the record, although this was not the result of a band rift; as \\"it's accepted that when in the studio, whoever's around will play whatever's at hand,\\" and \\"Tommy and Jamie have both played everything.\\" Scott, the main lyricist for the band, wrote many of the album's songs on guitar, \\"so it makes sense for me to play them. But it's good to have Jamie's angle on things 'cos I like my jazz chords and Jamie loves to stick his distortion on and play straight rock 'n' roll.\\" Scott used Fender Pro Reverb and Vox AC30 amplifiers on the album, and his Fender Coronado guitar, the only guitar that he owned at the time. Scott, less phased with guitar \\"snobbery\\" than Murphy, explained, \\"to be honest, I prefer to put my guitar straight into the desk and I use pedals or the desk's own effects. Sometimes all this snobbery about amps is a load of bullshit. For instance, the AC30 I used was crap!\\" In an interview, when Griffiths commented that \\"people think that if they use the same equipment at The Beatles, then their music's going to sound to the same. But it's all about the vibe created on the day,\\" Scott added that \\"Jamie's a sucker for all that shit. He's got his twin Marshalls and his six million effects on stage, but he's living the whole lifestyle, bless 'im.\\" Two guest musicians played on the album; flautist Ben Roberts and percussionist Gerald Lynch. The record was co-produced and engineered by Jeremy Wheatley, with assistance from Andrea Wright and Dave Buchanan. Wheatley had previously engineered most of the tracks from Spiders. Very shortly after the completion of the album, but prior to its release, drummer Andy Parle left the band, instantly being replaced by Leon Caffrey. Parle had become a \\"latent casualty\\", which was ironic as he was the healthiest member during the band's period of problems. Caffrey had been a friend of the group for a long time and made his debut with the band in the promotion of Tin Planet. For \\"The Ballad of Tom Jones\\", Cerys Matthews of the Welsh band Catatonia, who Space had supported live back in 1996, was brought in to duet with Scott, which fueled rumours in the press that the two were linked romantically, when in fact they were just good friends. Yorkie provided the scratch-track for Matthews' vocals in the song's demo. Artwork Artist and musician Mike Badger, pictured here in 1997, helped provide the title and artwork for the album. Mike Badger, a Liverpool-based musician and fine art sculptor, as well as a founding member of The La's, was commissioned by the band to create the visuals for Tin Planet, as they wanted a local artist that they knew personally to work with them. At the time, the band did not have a title for the record. Badger had been constructing sculptures out of scrapped metal objects and appliances shaped to look like aliens and robots, and was planning to use them for an animated Super 8 film he was working on in his spare time, entitled Tin Planet. The film eventually never got finished, but the band realised that the name was a perfect fit for the album, and without haste Badger granted them permission to use it. Badger found producing the artwork challenging, as he discovered at the last minute that each individual piece of the robot sculpture were being photographed separately, resembling an Airfix model kit, before it was being assembled, whereas he had presumed that only the finished sculpture would be shot. The completed robot ended up appearing on the back of the sleeve, and was donated by Badger in 2011 to be exhibited at the Museum of Liverpool. Badger would also go on to produce the covers for the \\"Avenging Angels\\" and \\"Begin Again\\" singles, as well as the music video for \\"Avenging Angels\\" and a television commercial promoting the album. Alongside the standard CD packaging, earlier limited editions of Tin Planet came with a special metallic tin packaging. Reception Upon its release, Tin Planet was met with critical and commercial acclaim, receiving a rare five-star rating from Q Magazine, although some critics were still eager to peg them as a novelty act. The album's lead single \\"Avenging Angels\\" was made NME's Single of the Week. Allmusic's Jason Damas noted how, \\"before the release of Tin Planet, lead vocalist Tommy Scott made reference to the album as being one of the finest pop records ever made.\\" Later reflections on the album have been mixed, with bandmembers voicing their disappointment with the slicker sound compared to Spiders, and feeling that their label Gut Records were trying to manipulate them into becoming, in their words, \\"the next Beautiful South\\". Aftermath After touring and promotional commitments of Tin Planet concluded in late 1998, Space returned to the studio to commence work on their third album, tentatively titled Love You More than Football. However, Gut Records objected to Edwyn Collins being chosen as producer, and forced the band to rework the material several times, delaying its release for over two years until it was eventually scrapped in July 2001. By that time the band had terminated their contract with Gut and Jamie Murphy, who was growing restless and distant from the others, was dismissed from the line-up. Love You More than Football now primilarly exists as a bootleg, due to a promotional copy on CD-R which circulated around May 2000. As a result, Space, now reduced to a four-piece, laid low for a couple of years, sporadically releasing several songs as a free-to-download MP3s through their website, becoming one of the first major groups to do so. However, they did not release another studio album proper until Suburban Rock 'N' Roll, which was recorded in 2002 and released through RandM Records in 2004.

He is credited with introducing the steam whistle to American locomotives. In 1842, Tsar Nicholas I hired him to build the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìMoscow Railway, Russia's first large-scale railroad.Gasparini, D. A., K. Nizamiev, and C. Tardini. \\"GW Whistler and the Howe Bridges on the Nikolaev Railway, 1842‚Äì1851\\", American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities 30.3 (2015): DOI link:04015046.https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000791 One of Whistler's important influences was the introduction of the Howe truss for the Russian railroad's bridges. This inspired the renowned Russian engineer Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii (1821‚Äì1891) to perform studies and develop structural analysis techniques for Howe truss bridges. He was the father of American artist James McNeill Whistler, whose painting Whistler's Mother (of his second wife Anna Whistler) is among the most famous paintings in American art. Early life and family George Washington Whistler was born on May 19, 1800, at the military outpost of Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Major John Whistler (1756‚Äì1829) and his wife Anna Bishop. Ft. Wayne at that time was a part of the great Northwest Territory. His father had been a British soldier under General Burgoyne at the Battles of Saratoga in the Revolutionary War, later to enlist in American service. Whistler had three children with his first wife, Mary Roberdeau Swift, who died at a young age in 1827., Anon., George Washington Whistler (1800‚Äì1849), University of Glasgow, accessed at Biographical sketch of G. W. Whistler at the Center for Whistler Studies at the University of Glasgow, Scotland on June 20, 2016. Whistler then married the sister of his friend William Gibbs McNeill (1801‚Äì1853), Anna Mathilda McNeill (1804‚Äì1881), with whom he had five sons: James Abbott McNeill Whistler, William McNeill Whistler (1836‚Äì1900), Kirk Boott (1838‚Äì1842) named after Kirk Boott, Charles Donald Whistler (1841‚Äì1843), and John Bouttatz Whistler (1845‚Äì1846), named after Whistler's Russian engineer friend Major Ivan F. Bouttatz. Education and career Whistler graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1819.Anon., Smithsonian Museum of American History, accessed at on June 20, 2016 Upon graduation, Whistler was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Corps of Artillery serving as a topography engineer at Fort Columbus, New York, from 1819 to 1821.\\"Register of Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, Class of 1819\\", Cullum's Register, created by W. Thayer. When the Army was reorganized in 1821, he became a Second Lieutenant in the First Artillery. From 1821 to 1822, Whistler was an Assistant Professor of Drawing at West Point. Whistler was reassigned back to artillery corps duty as a topographical engineer in 1822, his first assignment was supporting the Commission tracing the international boundary between Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods. Subsequent to the passage of the General Survey Act of 1824, Whistler later conducted surveys for locating railroads working under John James Abert, the head of the Topographic Bureau. =Baltimore and Ohio railroad= In 1827, Whistler's brother-in-law and fellow engineer William Gibbs McNeill became a member of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad's \\"Board of Civil Engineers for the Construction of the Road\\" (1827‚Äë30).\\"Register of Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, Class of 1819\\", Cullum's Register, created by W.

Together, Whistler, McNeill, and Jonathan Knight went to Great Britain to study railroad engineering, where they were welcomed by President Telford, of the British Institution of Civil Engineers, where they also met with George Stephenson and son, John Walker, Joseph Locke, Jesse Hartley, and other eminent British engineers. They also saw the British railroad, the Stockton and Darlington,Stapleton, Darwin H. \\"The Origin of American Railroad Technology, 1825‚Äì1840\\", Railroad History 139 (1978): 65‚Äì77. Web. the world's first public railway to use steam locomotives. As one observer wrote: Whistler supervised construction of the first rails on the railroad in October 1829, consisting of wood and iron from Pratt Street to the Carrollton Viaduct. The railroad's future road master, Wendel Bollman, helped with the construction layout as a fifteen-year-old carpenter. =Other railroads= In 1830, McNeill and Whistler entered the service of the Baltimore and Susquehanna railroad, Whistler remaining on the project for the first 20 miles of main and branch track had been completed. In 1831‚Äë32, Whistler provided engineering services for the Paterson and Hudson River railroad (now southern terminus of Erie) Railroad; and in 1833‚Äë34, upon the Providence and Stonington Railroad. Whistler resigned his army engineer commission in December 1833. In 1835, along with William Gibbs McNeill, Whistler designed the Boston & Providence Railroad, which included the famous Canton Viaduct which has been in continuous service for 174 years. =Locomotive designer and builder= In 1834, Whistler became chief engineer at the Proprietors of Locks and Canals in the new city of Lowell, Massachusetts. Whistler was one of the few locomotive designers and builders in the early 19th century that had an academic education. As superintendent of the Proprietors of Locks and Canals Co. water powered machine shop in Lowell (1834‚Äì1837), Whistler was responsible for the design of the earliest steam locomotive built in New England., pages 457 In 1835, he worked with Patrick Tracy Jackson to begin the Boston & Lowell Railroad. Whistler's first locomotive, the Patrick, was produced for the Boston & Lowell Railroad. This locomotive and others built by the firm were initially copies of Stephenson Planet types (2-2-0s).Anon., \\"Histories of the Individual Firms\\", (2007). Railroad History, (197), page 56, 24‚Äì85. In 1836, the first two steam locomotives known to have been equipped with whistles were built by Whistler as 2-2-0 types; the Hicksville for the Long Island Railroad and the Susquehanna for the Wilmington & Susquehanna Railroad.Baer, Christopher T. \\"A General Chronology of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company Predecessors and Successors and its Historical Context\\", 1835‚Äì1836, June 2015 Edition. In 1838, Baltimore and Ohio railroad engineers Knight and Latrobe surveyed steam locomotives for their management, some of which included machines built in Whistler's Lowell shops.Knight, Jonathan. Report Upon the Locomotive Engines: And the Police and Management of Several of the Principal Rail Roads in the Northern and Middle States, Being a Sequel to the Report... Upon Railway Structures. Lucas & Deaver., 1838. Whistler built three machines for the Boston and Providence Rail Road, they were almost 9 tons in gross weight and 6 tons in weight on the five foot driving wheels, a 2-4-0 configuration. These machines had 11 inch cylinders with a 16 inch stroke. Whistler also built one locomotive for the New Jersey and Patterson Rail Road weighing 8 tons gross. Whistler left Lowell in 1837 and was followed by his apprentice, James B Francis. The Lowell Machine Shop's locomotive production continued until 1854. =Western railroad (Massachusetts)= 1837 Western Railroad map, Springfield to State Line Soon after Whistler's work on the Stonington Railroad he was engaged to consult on the Western railroad again with McNeill from 1836 to 1842.Vose, George Leonard. A Sketch of the Life and Works of George W. Whistler: Civil Engineer. Boston: Lee and Shepard; New York: CT Dillingham, 1887. In October 1839, the road's Board of Directors hired Whistler as its Chief engineer.Smith, Merritt Roe. Military enterprise and technological change: Perspectives on the American experience. MIT Press, 1985. Accessed at The main problem in locating the railroad were the steep grades west of the Westfield River, a major tributary of the Connecticut River, which were in excess of 80 feet to the mile, (actually 1.65%. west of Chester, Massachusetts). At that time in 1842, there was no known locomotive that could deliver the tractive effort to climb that grade. The first locomotives purchased for the road in 1842 were Ross Winan's \\"crabs\\" or 0-8-0s which could not handle the grade. Whistler substituted Stephenson Planet types (2-2-0s) which delivered satisfactory service. =Saint Petersburg‚ÄìMoscow Railway= A bridge model of similar design to the Canton Viaduct at the October Railroad Museum in St. Petersburg Msta River Howe truss railroad bridge Tsar Nicholas I invited Whistler to help build the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìMoscow Railway, which would be Russia's first major railroad. Although the Tsarskoye Selo Railway, built by Germany's Franz Anton Ritter von Gerstner in 1837, was Russia's first public railway line, the cost overruns led Tsar Nicholas I and his advisors to doubt Gerstner's ability to execute the planned St. Petersburg‚ÄìMoscow line. So two professors from St. Petersburg's Institute of the Corps of Transportation Engineers, Pavel Petrovich Melnikov and Nikolai Osipovich Kraft, traveled to the United States in 1839 to study railroad technology.Decker, John C., \\"Early American Railroad History: A New Source Within Grasp\\", and on July 24, 2016. Melnikov and Kraft spoke with Whistler and recommended that the Russian government retain Whistler as a consulting engineer on the Saint Petersburg ‚Äì Moscow Railway, and Whistler was given a seven-year contract. Whistler left for Russia in June 1842, accompanied by imperial engineer Major Ivan F. Bouttatz, who would become Whistler's friend. He received the Order of Saint Anna by the Russian Emperor in 1847 but contracted cholera and died on April 7, 1849, in Saint Petersburg, Russia, two years before the line was completed. Professional associations Whistler was part of the first efforts to form a national engineering association in the United States, although unsuccessful, it was thirteen years ahead of the American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects, which was co-founded in 1852 by his nephew Julius Walker Adams. There was an organizational meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1839 that elected Benjamin Latrobe as its president. The organizing committee included some of the most prominent and representative engineers of the day such as: J. B. Jervis and Benjamin Wright of New York, Moncure Robinson and Claude Crozet of Virginia, Jonathan Knight of Maryland, J. Edgar Thomson then in Georgia, later in Pennsylvania.Merritt, Raymond H. Engineering in American Society: 1850‚Äì1875, page 99, University Press of Kentucky, 2015. Legacy Whistler's stone arch railroad bridges built in 1841 are still in freight and passenger service on the CSX mainline in western Massachusetts. He was the first civil engineer in America to use contour lines to show elevation and relief on maps. Works *Whistler, G. W., Faden, W., & United States. (1838).

However, as an agent of The Center, he often proved that he is clever and a quick thinker. Martin has a peculiar love for everything slimy, sloppy, and gooey - things that make Diana gag. Martin's favourite hobby is teasing Diana with practical jokes and creeping her out, even though she often retaliates with physical abuse. Regardless of whether he is at school or on a mission, he remains an immature and hyperactive nerd, constantly bursting with energy. He seldom thinks before leaping into danger, often helping those in peril whenever the team are on a mission. Martin has a tendency to jump to conclusions and come up with every unlikely theory he can think of, usually from some movie he saw or from his subscription to \\"Paranormal Monthly\\". As the leader of the trio, Martin is also the only one who wears a U-Watch. Martin's first monster was Venoso, a female chameleon monster that has the power to shape-shift into any person it wants. :He is seen in a crossover episode of Totally Spies!. During the episode, he is smitten with Clover, even though she seems uninterested in him. Towards the end of the same episode, Clover finally showed interests in Martin and even tries to get his attention, but Martin and Alex have hit it off due to a shared love of comics and video games. Throughout the episode, Martin continuously describes Sam as a \\"really lame buzz-kill\\" just like his sister, which causes her to lash out at him as Diana normally does. A running gag in the series is Martin's constant flirting with every beautiful girl he meets, who usually reject him with verbal or (in Jenni's case) physical abuse. Martin is voiced by Sam Vincent. ;Diana Lombard :Diana is a 16-year-old girl, usually seen with her two signature hair clips and her small purple shoulder bag. She is normally seen as the clean-freak, goody-goody, overachiever, and brainiac of the trio. Diana can be very jumpy and squeamish at times, which leads to Martin calling her a \\"wimp\\". However, she shows great courage when called upon and her intelligence often comes in handy on their missions. Not sharing Martin's love of the paranormal, she often tries to reason with logic instead of jumping to conclusions. :Diana has a hard time keeping her cool with Martin and will generally slap, kick, beat on, or scream at him quite often. Their arguments tend to end in some sort of bet, which Diana usually loses. She also seems to be the \\"bait\\" for the majority of their missions and is often one of the earliest victims, including being cocooned by an acid-spewing insect queen, turned into a frog by a warlock Martin unleashed, and being possessed by a vengeful spirit at a mountain lodge. When Martin is incapacitated by other monsters, Diana uses her own skills to save him and even wears Martin's U-watch in a few episodes. Diana is voiced by Kelly Sheridan. ;Java the Caveman :Java, the 200,000-year-old caveman, is friends with both Martin and Diana. He works at Torrington as a cook and a janitor. However, Java assists Martin and Diana in their investigations, serving as the team's tracker. His brute strength proves useful when battling monstrous foes or breaking through barriers. :Even though he is a lover of lizards and spiders, Java fears cats, heights, and technology. His fear of technology is a running gag in the show. Java's English is fairly simplistic, thus he does not contribute meaningfully to most conversations (e.g. \\"What that?\\", \\"Diana bald\\", and \\"Java no like this place\\"). Despite this shortcoming, Java has a knack for thinking \\"outside the box\\", which greatly helps in the team's investigations. Java is a significant source of comedy in the show due to his reactions to various scenarios and his poor hygiene as a caveman (e.g. his offensive foot odour, stinky armpits, and filthy breath). Java is sometimes the victim of the paranormal, including being transformed into a monster, such as when he inhaled the Chaos Beast in its gas form, or was brainwashed by a pirate-controlled Martin. Java is voiced by Dale Wilson. ;M.O.M. :As the multi-tasking director of \\"The Center\\", M.O.M. oversees the investigation of paranormal activities throughout the world. Martin's capabilities make him one of her favourite agents - if \\"favourite\\" is taken to mean \\"the agent that she would rather spend the most time with in the field and out of her office\\". Her real name is unknown, though she used the alias Ms. Olivia Mandell (derived from the initials M.O.M.) in the episode \\"Web of the Spider Creature\\". :Before working at The Center, she used to drive an ice cream truck. Serious, uncompromising, and an expert at hand-to-hand combat, she usually has to deal with Martin blowing up nearly every piece of gadgetry she is working on whenever he appears for a debriefing in her office (a running gag until season 3). Despite her typically dry sense of humor, M.O.M. is actually - as Billy says - \\"a real party animal when she gets going\\". The team sees proof of this when she accidentally shows them a series of photographs in the episode \\"The Amazon Vapor\\", while trying to debrief them on their next mission, due to some malfunctions at The Center. When she was an agent, the first creature she captured was Gastromo, a parasitic, iron-eating, slug-like monster who infects and controls those he touches. It appears her favourite holiday is Christmas when she is always in a rather happy and festive mood. As a result, Martin says in disbelief that it looks like \\"M.O.M. is actually having fun\\". In the crossover episode of Totally Spies! titled \\"Totally Mystery Much?\\", M.O.M. is shown to have a possibly romantic history with the spies' boss Jerry, much to the spies' and Martin's displeasure, as she and Jerry spy-flirt between holograms. The initials M.O.M. are said to actually stand for \\"Mystery Organization Manager\\", as explained by Martin in that episode. M.O.M. is voiced by Teryl Rothery. ;Billy :Billy is a tiny green alien who works for \\"The Center\\", as M.O.M.'s personal secretary, often seen flying on his mini hovercraft. He idolizes Martin and in one episode, it was revealed that he even has a picture of Martin (marking him as the \\"crazed fan of the show\\" archetype). He usually greets the gang when they are first signed in, and often does his signature high five with Martin. His role is generally a supportive one; he pops in sometimes during a mission to give Martin, Diana, and Java valuable information, usually startling them in the process. He also analyses slime or fabric samples that Martin sends in during a mission. However, he won't help Martin and the gang on a mission directly unless he is forced to. :In the second season, Billy was revealed to have once been a great alien warrior, known as Ganthar, on another planet, but he gave up violence for good. When Martin asked why a planet on Billy's list of hologram worlds was blue, it was revealed by M.O.M. to be the world which changed Ganthar into Billy, which is the reason he doesn't go on missions with the other three agents. He arrived on Earth in the Roswell UFO Incident in 1947. Billy adopted a human disguise ‚Äî the \\"B.S. 1000\\" ‚Äî to be with Martin and Diana at their school. There are a few episodes in season 3, in which it is hinted that he has romantic feelings for Diana, such as one of the Christmas specials where he invited her under the mistletoe and actually went on a friendly date with her. It is revealed in the episode \\"Revenge of the Doppelganger\\" that Billy was once a supermodel on his home planet. This might be true; since he was fearsome and powerful, he might have been popular with his people. Billy is also voiced by Samuel Vincent. ;Jenni Anderson :Jenni is Diana's best friend and Martin's love interest, although she does not return any of his affection. Her view of Martin is generally not very flattering. She describes him as \\"immature\\", a \\"freak\\", and a \\"loser\\". Jenni is also one of the prettiest and most popular girls attending Torrington. She has blue eyes and flared auburn- coloured hair, usually seen wearing a black blouse and skirt with knee-high boots. :Though Jenni usually sees Martin as a \\"brat\\", there have been times where she genuinely seems interested in pursuing a relationship with him, particularly when Martin acts like a gentleman. Unfortunately for Martin, though, this never lasts. Reasons for this included her memory being erased, Martin subsequently doing something stupid, or something else interfering, like when Jenni moved away for a semester. Jenni is voiced by Tabitha St. Germain. ;Marvin :Marvin, Martin's rival, enjoys the extreme, saying that he enjoys the adrenaline rush that comes with such activities. Some of his activities includes rock climbing in the Himalayas, parasailing over the Great Barrier Reef, street-luging on the German Autobahn, jungle kayaking, and snowboarding down the face of K2. He does virtually everything that Martin himself can do, but better, and even dresses similarly. His father is a pilot, explaining Marvin's ability to travel around the world frequently. Marin is intelligent and smart and, apparently, more cerebral than Martin. :Marvin first appeared in the episode \\"Attack of the Mothman\\" where he shows off his skateboarding skills and a comic book featuring a protagonist based on him. His talents and popularity make Martin jealous as Diana, Java, Jenni, Billy, and even Torrington as a whole fawn over him. He reappears in \\"The Amazon Vapor\\" where he discovers Martin and Diana's secret and helps on their mission with his talents and quick thinking. Diana fears and Martin hopes that they will erase his memory of the event. However, in \\"The Third Eye\\", it is revealed that he works for The Center and has acquired his own U-Watch because M.O.M. recognized his amazing potential. :Unfortunately, he ends up being relegated to The Center's South Pole facility because of his negligence in the previous mission, and blames his unfortunate circumstances on Martin. Martin remarks that it is not really that bad because he has a beautiful team mate, whom Martin has a crush on in the episode. Martin and Marvin continue in their mutual dislike until the episode \\"Body-Swappers\\", when Martin gives Marvin the majority of the credit for getting rid of the parasite and M.O.M. decides to relocate Marvin to Hawaii. In a subsequent episode, \\"Rage of the Leprechaun\\", Marvin contacts Martin and Diana for help after being stalked by a leprechaun that wanted to get back the magically lucky, four-leafed clover Marvin had stolen from him. After the incident, Marvin is punished by M.O.M. for keeping the clover instead of getting rid of it, which Martin calls a \\"rookie mistake\\", but M.O.M. is equally disappointed in him for letting greed get the best of him as well. What happens to Marvin after that is unknown, as he is not mentioned in the remainder of the series but it was presumed Marvin was sent back to The Center's South Pole facility as punishment. Marvin is voiced by Matt Hill. ;Gerard Mystery :Gerard Mystery is Martin's father and Diana's step-father. Unlike his immature son, Gerard is a very rational, logical person like Diana and considers anything related to the paranormal to be \\"balderdash\\". As a scientist, he spends much of his time doing field work in the forest. In the third season, he finds out about \\"The Center\\" and that Diana and Martin work for it. Diana's mother is never mentioned in the series and Gerard only spoke about Martin's mother once in season 3, when he thought Martin was going to tell his mom about what happened, when Martin was actually speaking about M.O.M. Gerard is voiced by Michael Donovan. Episode list Broadcast Martin Mystery aired in Canada on YTV and Discovery Kids in English, and on Vrak in French, from 2003 until the series finale in 2006.

Gonzalez Blanco. El Turismo Cultural en Ponce durante el Plan Ponce en Marcha, 1900‚Äì2000. Neysa Rodriguez Deynes, Editor. Ponce, Puerto Rico: Professional Editions. 2018. p.15. Its primary goal was to work for Puerto Rico's independence. The Party's selection in 1930 of Pedro Albizu Campos as its president brought a radical change to the organization and its tactics. In the 1930s, intimidation, repression and persecution of Party members by the government, then headed by a U.S. president-appointed governor, led to the assassination of two government officials, the attempted assassination of a federal judge in Puerto Rico, and the Rio Piedras and Ponce massacres. Under the leadership of Albizu Campos, the party abandoned the electoral process in favor of direct armed conflict as means to gain independence from the United States. By the late 1940s, a more US-friendly party, the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD), had gained an overwhelming number of seats in the legislature and, in 1948, it passed Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law), which attempted to suppress the Nationalist Party and similar opposition. The Puerto Rican police arrested many Nationalist Party members under this law, some of whom were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. With a new political status pending for Puerto Rico as a Commonwealth, Albizu Campos ordered armed uprisings in several Puerto Rican towns to occur on October 30, 1950. In an related effort, two Nationalists also attempted to assassinate US President Harry S. Truman on November 1, 1950, in an effort to call international attention to issues related to Puerto Rico's political status, but the attempt failed. The last major armed event by the Nationalists occurred in 1954 at the US House of Representatives when four party members shot and wounded five Congressmen. After Albizu Campos's death in 1965, the party dissolved into factions and members joined other parties, but some continue to follow the party's ideals in one form or another, often informally or ad hoc, to this day.Protesta interrumpe mensaje del gobernador.

Historical context The first American governor of Puerto Rico resigned to become Puerto Rico's first sugar baron After four hundred years of colonial domination under the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico finally received its sovereignty in 1898 through a Carta de Autonom√≠a (Charter of Autonomy). This Charter of Autonomy was signed by Spanish Prime Minister Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta and ratified by the Spanish Cortes.Ribes Tovar et al., p.106‚Äì109 Despite this, just a few months later, the United States claimed ownership of the island as part of the Treaty of Paris which concluded the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Opponents to the colonial government argued that the profits generated by this arrangement were one-sided, enormous for the United States. When the war ended, U.S. President McKinley appointed Charles Herbert Allen as the first civilian governor of Puerto Rico. Though Allen had a business background, his financial administration of Puerto Rico was strikingly unsound. He ignored the appropriation requests of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates, refused to make any municipal, agricultural or small business loans, built roads at double the costs of preceding administrations, and left 85% of the school-age population without schools. Rather than making these requested infrastructure and education investments, Allen's budget raided the Puerto Rican treasury. His administration re-directed tax revenues to no-bid contracts for U.S. businessmen, railroad subsidies for U.S.-owned sugar plantations, and high salaries for U.S. bureaucrats in the island government.Thomas Aitken, Jr.; Luis Munoz Marin: Poet in the Fortress, pp. 60‚Äì61; Signet Books/New American Library, 1965Manuel Maldonado-Denis; Puerto Rico: A Socio-Historic Interpretation, pp. 70‚Äì76; Random House, 1972 Allen's financial acumen improved considerably when he returned to the U.S., and resumed his own personal business interests. In 1901, Allen resigned as governor and installed himself as president of the largest sugar-refining company in the world, the American Sugar Refining Company. This company was later renamed as the Domino Sugar company. In effect, Charles Allen leveraged his governorship of Puerto Rico into a controlling interest over the entire Puerto Rican economy.Ribes Tovar et al., p.122‚Äì144 In 1914, the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously for independence from the United States. In 1917, the US Congress passed an act by which it granted citizenship to Puerto Rican residents. This was overwhelmingly opposed by the island's political leaders. Critics said the US was simply interested in increasing the size of its conscription pool to get soldiers for World War I.Manuel Maldonado-Denis; Puerto Rico: A Socio- Historic Interpretation, pp. 65‚Äì82; Random House, 1972 United States \\"Manifest Destiny\\" Pres. Roosevelt wielding his big stick in the Caribbean By 1930, over 40 percent of all the arable land in Puerto Rico had been converted into sugar plantations, which were entirely owned by Domino Sugar Company and U.S. banking interests. These bank syndicates also owned the entire coastal railroad, and the San Juan international seaport. This was not limited to Puerto Rico. By 1930 the United Fruit Company owned over one million acres of land in Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Mexico and Cuba.Rich Cohen; The Fish That Ate the Whale; pub. Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2012; pp. 146‚Äì150 By 1940, in Honduras alone, the United Fruit Company owned 50 percent of all private land in the entire country. In Guatemala, the United Fruit Company owned 75 percent of all private land by 1942 ‚Äì plus most of Guatemala's roads, power stations and phone lines, the only Pacific seaport, and every mile of railroad.Rich Cohen; The Fish That Ate the Whale; pub. Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2012; p. 174 The U.S. government supported all these economic exploits, and provided military \\"persuasion\\" whenever necessary. Founding of the Nationalist Party Jose Coll y Cuchi The origins of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party date to 1917, when a group of Union Party members in Ponce, dissatisfied with the attitude of the Union Party of Puerto Rico towards the \\"granting\\" of U.S. citizenship, formed the \\"Asociaci√≥n Nacionalista de Ponce\\" (Ponce Nationalist Association). Among its founders were Dr. Guillermo Salazar, Rafael Matos Bernier, J. A. Gonzalez, and Julio Cesar Fernandez. These men also founded the newspaper El Nacionalista.Neysa Rodriguez Deynes, Rafael J. Torres Torres and Carlos Aneiro Perez. Breviario sobre la Historia de Ponce y sus Principales Lugares de Interes. San Juan, Puerto Rico: Model Offset Printing. 1991. Page 63. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was formed as a direct response to the American colonial government. In 1919, Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠, a member of the Union Party of Puerto Rico, felt that the Union Party was not doing enough for the cause of Puerto Rican independence. Coll y Cuch√≠ and some followers left to form the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan. Under Coll y Cuch√≠'s presidency, the party convinced the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an Act that would permit the transfer of the remains of the Puerto Rican patriot, Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances, from Paris, France, to Puerto Rico. Don Pedro Albizu Campos The Legislative Assembly appointed Alfonso Lastra Charriez as its emissary since he had French heritage and spoke the language fluently. Betances' remains arrived in San Juan on August 5, 1920. A funeral caravan organized by the Nationalist Association transferred the remains from San Juan to the town of Cabo Rojo, where his ashes were interred by his monument. By the 1920s, two other pro-independence organizations had formed on the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association of Puerto Rico. The Independence Association was founded by Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a, Eugenio Font Su√°rez and Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920. On September 17, 1922, these three political organizations joined forces and formed the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Coll y Cuchi was elected president and Jos√© S. Alegr√≠a (father of Ricardo Alegr√≠a) vice-president. In 1924, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and was named vice-president. Alegr√≠a was named Nationalist Party president in 1928 and held that position until 1930. By 1930, disagreements between Coll y Cuchi and Albizu Campos as to how the party should be run, led the former and his followers to leave and return to the Union Party. Albizu Campos did not like what he considered to be Coll y Cuch√≠'s attitude of fraternal solidarity with the enemy.Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, By A. W. Maldonado, Pg. 86, Publisher: La Editorial, Universidad de Puerto Rico, (December 1, 2006), , On May 11, 1930, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party maintained that, as a matter of international law, the Treaty of Paris following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War could not have empowered the Spanish to \\"give\\" to the US what was no longer theirs. Under Albizu Campos's leadership during the years of the Great Depression, the party became the largest independence movement in Puerto Rico. In the mid-1930s, there were disappointing electoral results and strong repression by the territorial police authorities. The party staged some protests that developed into celebrated incidents because of police overreaction: The October 1935 Rio PiedrasThe Imprisonment of Men and Women Fighting Colonialism, 1898 ‚Äì 1958: 1930 ‚Äì 1940.

After the R√≠o Piedras massacre, in December 1935, Albizu Campos announced that the Nationalist Party would withdraw from electoral participation while the United States kept control. Campos began to advocate direct, violent revolution. Nationalist Party during 1930‚Äì1950 Nationalist Party partisans were involved in a variety of dramatic and violent confrontations between 1930 and 1950: *In the 1930s, the party organized the official youth organization the Cadets of the Republic (Cadetes de la Rep√∫blica , headed by Raimundo D√≠az Pacheco and the \\"Hijas de la Libertad\\" (Daughters of Freedom), the women's branch in which Julia de Burgos served as Secretary General. *On April 6, 1932, Nationalist partisans marched into the Capitol building in San Juan to protest a legislative proposal to establish the current Puerto Rican flag as the official flag of the insular government. Nationalists preferred the flag used during the Grito de Lares. A mel√©e ensued in the building, and one partisan fell to his death from a second floor interior balcony. The protest was condemned by the legislators Rafael Mart√≠nez Nadal and Santiago Iglesias; and endorsed by others, including the future leader of the statehood party, Manuel Garc√≠a M√©ndez. The Ponce massacre. Police open fire on unarmed marchers and bystanders on Palm Sunday. The 19 dead included a 7-year-old girl, who was shot in the back. *On October 24, 1935, a confrontation with police at University of Puerto Rico campus in R√≠o Piedras resulted in the deaths of 4 Nationalist partisans and one policeman. The event is known as the R√≠o Piedras massacre. This and other events led the party to announce on December 12, 1935, a boycott of all elections held while Puerto Rico remained part of the United States. *On February 23, 1936, in San Juan, two Nationalists assassinated the Insular Police Chief and ex-U.S. Marine officer, E. Francis Riggs. The Nationalist perpetrators, Hiram Rosado and El√≠as Beauchamp, were arrested, transported to police headquarters, and killed within hours without trial. No policeman was ever tried or indicted for their deaths.Manuel Maldonado-Denis; Puerto Rico: A Socio-Historic Interpretation, Random House, 1972 *On March 21, 1937, the Nationalist Party organized a peaceful march in the southern city of Ponce. At the last moment, the permit was withdrawn, and the Insular Police (a force \\"somewhat resembling the National Guard of the typical U.S. state\\" and which answered to the U.S.-appointed governor Blanton Winship) were arrayed against the marchers. They opened fire upon what a U.S. Congressman and others reported were unarmed and defenselessDon Luis Sanchez Frasquieri, President of the Ponce Rotary Club at the time Cadets and bystanders alike, killing 19 and badly wounding over 200 more. :Many of these unarmed people were shot in the back while trying to run away ‚Äì including a 7-year old girl, who died as a result.Five Years of Tyranny, Speech before the U.S. House of Representatives. The entire speech is contained in the Congressional Record of August 14, 1939. It is reported in the Cong. Rec., and various other publications elsewhere, that among those shot in their backs was a 7-year-old girl, Georgina Maldonado, who \\"was shot in the back while running to a nearby church.\\" An ACLU report declared it a massacre and it has since been known as the Ponce massacre. The march had been organized to commemorate the ending of slavery in Puerto Rico by the governing Spanish National Assembly in 1873, and to protest the incarceration by the U.S. government of nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. Soon thereafter, the Puerto Rican government arrested the leadership of the Nationalist party, including Pedro Albizu Campos. In two trials, they were convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States. :A government investigation into the incident drew few conclusions. A second, independent investigation ordered by the US Commission for Civil Rights (May 5, 1937) led by Arthur Garfield Hays (a member of the ACLU) with Fulgencio Pi√±ero, Emilio Belaval, Jose Davila Rice, Antonio Ayuyo Valdivieso, Manuel Diaz Garcia, and Franscisco M. Zeno, concluded that the events on March 21constituted a massacre. The report harshly criticized the repressive tactics and massive civil rights violations by the administration of Governor Blanton Winship. *On July 25, 1938, the municipality of Ponce organized celebrations to commemorate the American landing in 1898. This included a military parade and speeches by Governor Blanton Winship, Senate president Rafael Mart√≠nez Nadal, and others. When Winship rose to speak, shots were fired at him, slaying police Colonel Luis Irizarry, who was seated next to the governor. The Nationalist Interim President M. Medina Ram√≠rez repudiated the shooting and denied any involvement in it, but numerous Nationalists were arrested and convicted of participating in the shooting. Winship worked to repress the Nationalists. Jaime Benitez, a student at the University of Chicago at the time, wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt which in part read as follows: > Soon afterward, two Nationalist partisans, among them Raimundo D√≠az Pacheco, > attempted to assassinate Robert Cooper, judge of the Federal Court in Puerto > Rico.

These involved a dozen or so skirmishes throughout the island. Nationalist Revolts of 1950 El Imparcial headline: \\"Aviation (US) bombs Utuado\\" The first battle of the Nationalist uprisings occurred in the early hours of October 29, in barrio Macan√° of Pe√±uelas. The police surrounded the house of the mother of Melit√≥n Mu√±iz, the president of the Pe√±uelas Nationalist Party, that he was using as a distribution center for weapons for the Nationalist Revolt. Without warning, the police fired on the Nationalists and a firefight ensued, resulting in the death of two Nationalists and wounding of six police officers.El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza. by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez. Page 7. Publicaciones REN√â. The 296th Regiment of the U.S. National Guard occupy Jayuya In the Jayuya Uprising, led by Nationalist leader Blanca Canales, a police station and post office were burned. The town was held by the Nationalists for three days. The Utuado Uprising culminated in the Utuado Massacre by the local police, in which five Nationalists were executed. The San Juan Nationalist revolt was a Nationalist attempt to enter the Governor's mansion, La Fortaleza, in order to attack then-governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. The hour-long shootout resulted in the death of four Nationalists: Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Manuel Torres Medina and Raimundo D√≠az Pacheco. Three guards were also seriously wounded. Hip√≥lito Miranda D√≠az, killed in the Arecibo incident Various other shootouts took place throughout island ‚Äì including those at Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo, and Ponce, where Antonio Alicea, Jose Miguel Alicea, Francisco Campos (Albizu Campos's nephew), Osvaldo Perez Martinez and Ramon Pedrosa Rivera were arrested and accused of the murder of police corporal Aurelio Miranda during the revolt. Raul de Jesus was accused of violating the Insular Firearms Law. On October 31, police officers and National Guardsmen surrounded Sal√≥n Boricua, a barbershop in Santurce. Believing that a group of Nationalists were inside the shop, they opened fire. The only person in the shop was Campos barber Vidal Santiago D√≠az. Santiago D√≠az, who fought alone against the attackers for three hours, received five wounds, including one in the head. The battle was transmitted \\"live\\" via the radio airwaves to the public in general. On November 1, 1950, Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate U.S. President Harry S. Truman, who was staying at the Blair House in Washington, D.C. Truman supported development of a constitution for Puerto Rico and the 1952 status referendum on it; 82% of the voters approved the constitution. The US Congress also approved the constitution. On March 1, 1954, Lolita Lebr√≥n together with fellow Nationalists Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andr√©s Figueroa Cordero attacked the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. The group opened fire with automatic pistols. Some 30 shots were fired (mostly by Cancel, according to his account), wounding five lawmakers. One of the congressmen, Representative Alvin Bentley from Michigan, was seriously wounded. Upon her arrest, Lebr√≥n yelled \\"I did not come to kill anyone, I came to die for Puerto Rico!\\" On November 18, 1955, a non-violent splinter group of nationalists calling themselves La Quinta Columna (The 5th Column) broke away from the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party due to not supporting the ideas and thoughts of Albizu Campos, as to a Puerto Rico relationship with Spain as its Mother country and their nationalistic love for Puerto Rico as their Motherland. The other reason for the splinter group was due to the violence that took place in the 1950s. This splinter group would later become known in 1968 as El Movimiento Indio Taino de Boriken (The Taino Indian Movement of Puerto Rico) which was primarily made up of the children of the Puerto Rican Nationalists whom would come to establish the indigenous grassroots civil rights movement in Puerto Rico. Recent events Although less active, the Nationalist Party continues to exist as an organization and an ideology. It also has somewhat of a \\"chapter\\" in New York City. The New York Junta is an autonomous organ of the party that recognizes, and is recognized by, the National Junta in Puerto Rico. In 2006 and in representation of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, Jose Castillo spoke before the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization and said that the Nationalist Party \\"had appeared in the past to denounce colonialism in Puerto Rico and hoped the Special Committee would show its commitment to the island's struggle for self-determination, so that it could join the United Nations in its own right ... The Special Committee and its resolutions on Puerto Rico were indispensable instruments.\\" Castillo \\"called upon the United States Government to assure the Puerto Rican people of their right to self-determination and human rights and immediately cease the persecution, arrests, and murders perpetrated against independence fighters. Vieques peace activists must be freed immediately, and the FBI's electronic surveillance and continued harassment of independence fighters must be stopped. The United States must also end its actions against basic human rights while fully implementing the United Nations resolution calling for a constituent assembly to begin decolonization.\\" Castillo added that \\"Puerto Rico had its own national identity ... Since its 1898 invasion, the United States had tried to destroy the nationality of Puerto Rican people. It kept Puerto Rico in isolation, maintaining it as private corporation from which it earned billions a year ... exploitation had made foreigners richer and the Puerto Rican people poorer. The fact that Puerto Rico was the last territory in the world could not be hidden. Violation of rights there would cease only once it was a free and independent nation. The United States must provide compensation for what it had done to Puerto Rico's land and people.\\"Special Committee on Decolonization Approves Text Calling on United States to Expedite Puerto Rican Self-determination Process; Draft Resolution Urges Probe of Pro-Independence Leader‚Äôs Killing, Human Rights Abuses; Calls for Clean-up, Decontamination of Vieques (Issued on 13 June 2006.).

It is a specific form of motion sickness, and is considered a normal response in healthy individuals. Airsickness occurs when the central nervous system receives conflicting messages from the body (including the inner ear, eyes and muscles) affecting balance and equilibrium. Whereas commercial airline passengers may simply feel poorly, the effect of airsickness on military aircrew may lead to a decrement in performance and adversely affect the mission.Samuel, O., & Tal, D. (2015). Airsickness: Etiology, Treatment, and Clinical Importance‚ÄîA Review. Military medicine, 180(11), 1135-1139. The inner ear is particularly important in the maintenance of balance and equilibrium because it contains sensors for both angular (rotational) and linear motion. Airsickness is usually a combination of spatial disorientation, nausea and vomiting.Antunano, Melchor J., M.D. Medical Facts for Pilots (pdf) Federal Aviation Administration, Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Publication: AM-400-03/1.  Signs and symptoms  Common symptoms of airsickness include: Nausea, vomiting, vertigo, loss of appetite, cold sweating, skin pallor, difficulty concentrating, confusion, drowsiness, headache, and increased fatigue. Severe airsickness may cause a person to become completely incapacitated.  Risk factors The following factors increase some people's susceptibility to airsickness: *Fatigue, stress and anxiety are some factors that can increase susceptibility to motion sickness of any type. *The use of alcohol, drugs, and medications may also contribute to airsickness. *Additionally, airsickness is more common in women (especially during menstruation or pregnancy), young children, and individuals prone to other types of motion sickness.Hain, Timothy C., M.D. (2006) Motion Sickness. *Although airsickness is uncommon among experienced pilots, it does occur with some frequency in student pilots. Prevention Travelers who are susceptible to motion sickness can minimize symptoms by: *Choosing a window seat with a view of the ground or of lower clouds, such that motion can be detected. This will not work if the plane is flown in the clouds for a long duration. *Choosing seats with the smoothest ride in regards to pitch (the seats over the wings in an airplane). This may not be sufficient for sensitive individuals who need to see ground movement. *Sitting facing forward while focusing on distant objects rather than trying to read or look at something inside the airplane. *Eating dry crackers, olives or suck on a lemon, to dry out the mouth, lessening nausea. *Drinking a carbonated beverage. Treatment =Medication= Medications that may alleviate the symptoms of airsickness include: *meclozine *dimenhydrinate *diphenhydramine *scopolamine (available in both patch and oral form). Pilots who are susceptible to airsickness are usually advised not to take anti-motion sickness medications (prescription or over-the-counter). These medications can make one drowsy or affect brain functions in other ways. =Non-medication based = A method to increase pilot resistance to airsickness consists of repetitive exposure to the flying conditions that initially resulted in airsickness. In other words, repeated exposure to the flight environment decreases an individual's susceptibility to subsequent airsickness. Recently, several devices have been introduced that are intended to reduce motion sickness through stimulation of various body parts (usually the wrist). =Alternative medicine= Ginger.

Early life and family Cornford was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, on 27 February 1874. He attended St Paul's School, London. In 1909 Cornford married the poet Frances Darwin, daughter of Sir Francis Darwin and Ellen Wordsworth Darwin, n√©e Crofts, and a granddaughter of Charles Darwin.

Taxonomy  The white-backed woodpecker was described by the German naturalist Johann Matth√§us Bechstein in 1802 under the binomial name Picus leucotos. The specific epithet leucotos combines the Classical Greek leukos meaning \\"white\\" and -n≈çtos meaning \\"-backed\\". The type locality is Silesia, a historical region mainly located in Poland. The species is now placed in the genus Dendrocopos that was introduced by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1816. Twelve subspecies are recognised. * D. l. leucotos (Bechstein, 1802) ‚Äì widespread across Eurasia from north, central and eastern Europe to northeast Asia, Korea and Sakhalin * D. l. uralensis (Malherbe, 1860) ‚Äì west Ural Mountains to Lake Baikal * D. l. lilfordi (Sharpe & Dresser, 1871) ‚Äì Pyrenees to Asia Minor, Caucasus and Transcaucasia * D. l. tangi Cheng, 1956 ‚Äì Sichuan province, western China * D. l. subcirris (Stejneger, 1886) ‚Äì Hokkaido, northern Japan * D. l. stejnegeri (Kuroda, 1921) ‚Äì northern Honsh≈´, Japan * D. l. namiyei (Stejneger, 1886) ‚Äì south Honsh≈´, Kyushu, Shikoku (Japan) * D. l. takahashii (Kuroda & Mori, 1920) ‚Äì Ulleungdo Island (off eastern Korea) * D. l. quelpartensis (Kuroda & Mori, 1918) ‚Äì Jeju Island (off South Korea) * D. l. owstoni (Ogawa, 1905) ‚Äì Amami ≈åshima Island in the northern Ryukyu Islands, Japan * D. l. fohkiensis (Buturlin, 1908) ‚Äì mountains of Fujian province, southeast China * D. l. insularis (Gould, 1863) ‚Äì Taiwan The subspecies D. l. owstoni is sometimes recognised as a distinct species, the Amami woodpecker.  Description  It is the largest of the spotted woodpeckers in the western Palearctic, 24‚Äì26 cm long with wing-span 38‚Äì40 cm. The plumage is similar to the great spotted woodpecker, but with white bars across the wings rather than spots, and a white lower back. The male has a red crown, the female a black one. Drumming by males is very loud, calls include a soft kiuk and a longer kweek.  Distribution  The nominate race D. l. leucotos occurs in central and northern Europe, with the race D. l. lilfordi found in the Balkans and Turkey. Ten further races occur in the region eastwards as far as Korea and Japan. It is a scarce bird, requiring large tracts of mature deciduous forests with high amounts of standing and laying dead wood. Numbers have decreased in Nordic countries. In Sweden, its population decline has caused the Swedish government to enact protection for the species in the national Biodiversity Action Plan.National Biodiversity Action Plan of Sweden, Upsala (1999)  Ecology  In the breeding season it excavates a nest hole about 7 cm wide and 30 cm deep in a decaying tree trunk. It lays three to five white eggs and incubates for 10‚Äì11 days. It lives predominantly on wood-boring beetles as well as their larvae, as well as other insects, nuts, seeds and berries. = Life Span = In the wild the white- backed Woodpecker (Dendrocopos leucotos) can survive between three to four years, while in captivity they can survive for approximately eleven years.

Although its exact nature is unclear, the accounts of ancient historians seem to describe it as a sort of crane equipped with a grappling hook that was able to lift an attacking ship partly out of the water, then either cause the ship to capsize or suddenly drop it. It was dropped onto enemy ships, which would then swing itself and destroy the ship. These machines featured prominently during the Second Punic War in 214 BC, when the Roman Republic attacked Syracuse with a fleet of 60 quinqueremes under Marcus Claudius Marcellus. When the Roman fleet approached the city walls under cover of darkness, the machines were deployed, sinking many ships and throwing the attack into confusion. Historians such as Livy attributed heavy Roman losses to these machines, together with catapults also devised by Archimedes. The plausibility of this invention was tested in 1999 in the BBC series Secrets of the Ancients and again in early 2005 in the Discovery Channel series Superweapons of the Ancient World. The producers of Superweapons brought together a group of engineers tasked with conceiving and implementing a design that was realistic, given what is known about Archimedes. Within seven days they were able to test their creation, and they did succeed in tipping over a model of a Roman ship so that it would sink. While this does not prove the existence of the Claw, it suggests that it would have been possible. See also * :Ancient weapons  Further reading  * C. K.

Fresh (unsalted) cod is referred to as bacalhau fresco (fresh cod). Portuguese and other cuisines Bacalhau dishes are common in Portugal, and also in former Portuguese colonies like Cape Verde, Angola, Macau, Brazil, and Goa. There are said to be over 1000 recipes in Portugal alone and it can be considered the iconic ingredient of Portuguese cuisine (but curiously the only fish that is not consumed fresh in this fish loving country, boasting the highest per capita fish consumption within the European Unionhttp://www.eumofa.eu/documents/20178/84590/EU+consumer+habits_final+report+.pdf/5c61348d-a69c-449e-a606-f5615a3a7e4c page 9). It is often cooked on social occasions and is the traditional Christmas Eve dinner in some parts of Portugal. Similar recipes can be found across Europe. It is also found in the cuisines of other territories and regions like Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Suriname. In Norway bacalao commonly refers to a specific Spanish-style dish prepared with salted and dried cod, potatoes, onions, tomatoes and olives which was assimilated to Norwegian cuisine in the 20th century, and is now officially spelled bakalao For centuries, salted, dried cod came primarily from the North Atlantic fisheries of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and Georges Bank, (bacalhau da Terra Nova), with the salting and drying done in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, with lesser volumes caught an dried in Iceland and Norway. It used to be very affordable, but with the collapse of the cod stocks and dismantling of Portuguese bacalhoeiro fleet, it became more expensive, especially near Easter and Christmas time, since it is a part of many traditional dishes of the holiday season.  Cuisine  There are numerous bacalhau recipe variations, depending on region and tradition. In Portugal, it is said there are more than 365 ways to cook bacalhau, one for every day of the year; others say there are 1,001 ways. Whatever the exact number, bacalhau is a ubiquitous ingredient in Portuguese cuisine. Bacalhau is often served with potatoes and rice. Green (Vinho Verde) or mature wines (Alentejo Wine, D√£o Wine, or Douro Wine) are served alongside. Traditional bacalhau dish Some Bacalhau dishes: *Arroz de Bacalhau *A√ßorda de Bacalhau *Bacalhau √† Gomes de S√° (some varieties: Original, Porto) *Bacalhau √† Br√°s * Bacalhau Assado *Bacalhau √† Z√© do Pipo *Bacalhau √† Lagareiro *Bacalhau com Broa *Bacalhau com Castanhas *Bacalhau com natas (Bacalhau with cream) *Bacalhau com todos *Bacalhau Confitado em azeite *Bacalhau Espiritual *Bacalhau no Forno com Cebolada *Bacalhau Suado √† Lisboa *Pasteis de Bacalhau/Bolinhos de Bacalhau *Pataniscas de Bacalhau History Salt cod has been produced for at least 500 years, since the time of the European discoveries of the New World. Before refrigeration, there was a need to preserve the cod; drying and salting are ancient techniques to preserve nutrients and the process makes the cod tastier. More importantly, fish low in oils and fats allow for the drying and preservation process to occur: oils and fats prevent the salt water from preserving the fish. Cod fish have very low levels of oils, and most is located in the guts. Portuguese, Norman, Breton, and English fisherman were the first to adopt the salt-based curing technique from Basque fishermen in Newfoundland near the cod-rich Grand Banks by the late 1500s.Silva, p. 132 By the 1700s, salted cod had become a staple food for ordinary Portuguese people and by upper levels of Portuguese society.Silva, p. 133 With the advancements in freezing and transportation in the 1900s, salted cod from North America declined and Iceland and Norway became the major supplier of the salted fish to Portuguese markets.Silva, p. 134 During this time bacalhau was a cheap source of protein and frequently consumed.Mountinho, p 180 Thus, ' became a staple of the Portuguese cuisine, nicknamed ' (loyal friend). In fact, in Portugal, \\"cod\\" always refers to salted, dried codfish and it is very rare to find fresh cod (bacalhau fresco) for sale. This dish is also popular in Portugal and other Roman Catholic countries because of the church. For example, the Church forbade the eating of meat on many days (Fridays, Lent, and other festivals), and so ' dishes were eaten instead. Bacalhau is also popular in Sfax where this dish is eaten in the first day of Eid ul-Fitr with chermoula. In Portugal, ' is often sold as a generic product with no brand information. Customers are free to touch, smell, and otherwise personally inspect the fish, which is very different to how fresh seafood is often sold. Stores can carry a large variety of ' differing in color, size, smell, taste, and dryness. Such variation has led Portugal to define requirements as to what products can carry the label \\"Bacalhau de Cura Tradicional Portuguesa\\".

The James Bond books and films have featured exotic equipment and vehicles, which often prove to be critically useful. The original books and early adaptations had only relatively minimal pieces like the modified attache case in From Russia, with Love. However, the gadgets took on a more spectacular profile starting with the film version of Goldfinger, and its tremendous success encouraged the following films to have Bond supplied with still more equipment. For instance, it became an expected scene in each film where Q would present and demonstrate Bond's assigned tools for the mission, and it was a near guarantee that each and every piece would be invaluable to Bond in the field. Bond gadgets became an example of the literary technique of Chekhov's gun. Fans eventually complained that the use of gadgets became excessive in the Roger Moore films, particularly in Moonraker, and subsequent productions struggled to find a balance in which gadgets could have a place without giving the impression that the character unduly depended on them or using stories that arbitrarily included situations that exactly fit the use of the gadgets assigned. This article concerns the gadgets James Bond typically carried on his person, along with gadgets and gimmicks used by allies and villains. It does not include makeshift gadgets or weapons, animals, or general spy equipment and installations such as bulletproof vests, disguises, fake passports, surveillance, secret passages and trap doors, or explosives, unless particularly notable. Sean Connery era (1962‚Äì1967; 1971) =Dr. No= ; Geiger counter: Bond has to request one from Britain before using it to determine the radioactivity of Crab Key, suggesting they were uncommon pieces of equipment. The very first James Bond gadget. ; Cigarette with cyanide: Used by the \\"chauffeur\\" to commit suicide rather than being interrogated by Bond. ; Dragon tank: Tank vehicle equipped with flamethrowers. =From Russia with Love= ; James Bond's briefcase: : A special briefcase issued to all double-0 personnel featuring: * AR-7 .22 calibre survival rifle with infrared telescope and detachable suppressor * Twenty rounds of ammunition for the rifle concealed within the case * 50 gold sovereigns concealed within the case * Tear gas cartridge disguised as talcum powder, set to discharge when the briefcase is opened incorrectly. * Spring- loaded throwing knife accessible from the case's outside. ; Bug detector : A small device that detects the presence of phone taps ; Dagger shoe : A shoe with a concealed poisoned blade tip. Worn by SPECTRE agents, including Rosa Klebb and Morzeny. Dagger shoes were used in other non-James Bond films such as The Punisher and The Dark Knight ; Garrote watch : A wristwatch from which a wire garrote can be drawn. Preferred weapon by SPECTRE assassin recruit Red Grant. ; Periscope : A gift from the Royal Navy installed below the Russian embassy. Used to spy on the Russian conference room. ; Tape recorder camera : A small reel-to-reel tape recorder hidden within a camera, used to interrogate Tatiana. =Goldfinger = ; Oddjob's hat: Goldfinger's henchman, uses a special bowler hat with a metal ring inside the brim as a throwing weapon. The hat is capable of slicing through stone and metal or breaking a person's neck when thrown hard enough. ; Homing beacons: Used to track people. One is placed in Bond's shoe; another is placed on car and can be tracked up to 150 miles. ; Industrial laser: Used by Goldfinger trying to kill Bond. Powerful enough to put a laser dot on the moon, but at very close range able to cut through steel. This laser was later used to cut open the vault of Fort Knox. This film showcases the very first of its kind, as this weapon takes on various forms throughout the James Bond series. ; Parking meter that releases tear gas: One of Q's gadgets under test. ; Wetsuit with bird on top: A wetsuit for snorkeling with a seagull on top. =Thunderball= ; Homing pill : When Bond takes this pill, it emits a signal that can be detected only by a certain receiver. ; Remote-controlled doors: Although not a significant piece of technology today, in those times it was new. Used by main villain Emilio Largo to open a secret panel which leads to the SPECTRE briefing room in Paris, France. ; Air supply : A small device that can be carried on the person without notice and when in use, is held in the mouth to provide four minutes of air in emergencies when the user has to go underwater. (Effectively a miniature Scuba set.) ; Jetpack: A Bell Rocket Belt jetpack is used to propel Bond into the air during his escape in the opening gambit after killing Jaques Bouvar. Bond uses a Bell Textron jetpack in Die Another Day ; Underwater jetpack: Bond is equipped with a jet-propelled scuba tank. ; Breitling 'Top Time' Diver Chronometer watch : with built-in Geiger counter. ; Underwater camera : capable of taking eight shots in succession in darkness using an infra-red film. ; Geiger counter camera : A camera that conceals a Geiger counter. Bond gives this to Domino to look for the bombs on the yacht. ; Miniature flare Very pistol: a pocket-sized flare gun firing a red signalling beacon. ; Cassette recorder hidden in book : Bond uses this to learn that Quist is hiding in his hotel room. ; Electrocution staff chair :With the press of a button, Blofeld electrocutes the staff member on the seat which he sits on, then the seat drops down into the floor and comes back empty. ; Skyhook : Comes as a grappling suspender attached to a weather balloon that Bond can attach to his utility harness. With the aid of a specialised aircraft (B-17) installed with specialised braces, Bond and Domino are hoisted up into the air and out of the area. =You Only Live Twice= ; Mini-rocket cigarette : Tiger gives Bond a cigarette capable of shooting a rocket-powered projectile accurately up to 30 yards. Used in Blofeld's volcano to kill a technician standing by the entrance controls to enable his allies to storm the base. ; Waterproof body bag : Used at Bond's own \\"Funeral\\", this bag is completely waterproof complete with a breathing mask enabling Bond to breathe while being dumped overboard. The bag is even waterproof enough to allow him to wear a complete uniform before his briefing with M. ; Jet Propelled Bullets : Developed by Tiger Tanaka's facility, these bullet feature extra jet propulsion for added firepower. They however were not used. ; Little Nellie (WA-116): A portable autogyro built by Q Branch, which fits into a small duffel bag and can be assembled or dis-assembled anywhere. Contains machine guns, heat seeking missiles, aerial mines, and rocket launchers ; Gyrojet rocket guns : Prototype guns using a small rocket-propelled projectile rather than conventional ammunition. A limited number were made in real life for trials by the US and British military forces, but the design never caught on, and the guns and ammunition are now very collectible (and therefore highly sought after and expensive). ; X-Ray Desk: Used by Osato to identify any concealed firearms that his prospective 'clients' may have. ; Poison- delivering string : Used by a Japanese SPECTRE assassin to deliver a dose of poison from an attic by having it running along its length to land directly in the victim's mouth. Referenced or used several times in subsequent popular culture as well, such as in the gamebook series The Way of the Tiger.The Way of the Tiger book 1: Avenger, entry 229. By Mark Smith and Jamie Thomson. ; Bo with retractable spear : used by a SPECTRE henchmen who infiltrated Tanaka's base in an attempt to assassinate Bond. ; Lipstick gas: Helga Brant uses a lipstick case to discharge disorienting gas. ;Safe Cracking Machine : A pocket-sized device used by Bond to decipher the combination lock code of Osato's office safe. =Diamonds Are Forever= ; Cloning Facility : Blofeld's cloning facility where he picked candidates to surgically alter to resemble him. The facility contained various gadgets and surgical tools to which Bond later uses against him (which is later revealed to be one of his clones). ; Biometric fingerprint scanner: A projector-like device used by Tiffany Case in her Amsterdam apartment to identify her guests. One such example of how this device is used is when she takes the glass which Bond was using, then dusting the surface for a print and running it through the device and comparing it with a known fingerprint sample of her supposed guest. ; Pocket snap trap : A small gadget hidden in a pocket to give a person performing an unwanted search on the wielder a painful surprise. ; Fake fingerprint : Bond uses a fake fingerprint that clings to his thumb to trick Tiffany Case into believing he is Peter Franks. ; Mountaineering Pistol: Fires a grappling piton, complete with line; range about 10‚Äì15 meters. Also used as an improvised weapon against (a fake) Blofeld. ; Electromagnetic RPM Controller Ring: Q created a ring that, when used, ensures a jackpot at any slot machine. ; Grappling suspenders : In the last leg of Bond's elevator-top ride to Willard Whyte's suite, Bond uses the grappling cord built into his suspenders. The gadget's design is similar to that of the belt in For Your Eyes Only and GoldenEye. ; Voice changer : Blofield uses this to trick employees that he is Willard Whyte. Q puts together a makeshift one to fool Blofield, remarking that he made one for \\"the kids last Christmas.\\" ; Elevator with trap door : Used by Blofeld in Willard Whyte's building to incapacitate Bond. A spray of white smoke is emitted from the ceiling of the elevator rendering the occupant unconscious. A version of this elevator is used by villain Karl Stromberg in his sea lair where the floor separates ejecting the occupant into the shark tank (from the film The Spy Who Loved Me). ; Water Sphere : Used by Bond to \\"walk\\" on water when he is parachuted near Blofield's platform. ; Fake Muffler : One of the smugglers in the Diamond smuggling ring used a fake motorcycle muffler, which was actually a storage compartment for the diamonds. This man was later killed by Mr. Wint. ; Scorpion : Not a gadget, but used as one. Used by Mr. Wint to kill one of the Diamond Smugglers ; La Bombe Surprise : \\"Cake\\" with an \\"explosive filling\\", actually a domed shell covered in cake icing covering a small explosive device with a timer. Used by Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and unsuccessfully deployed against Bond. The bomb ended up being tied to Mr. Wint's rear end and tossed overboard, with explosive results. ; Flaming Shiskabob : Not a gadget, but used as one. When exposed by James Bond to be the assassins responsible for eliminating everyone in the diamond operation, Mr. Kidd then takes a pair of Shiskabobs and lights them on fire with the intent of using them as weapons. Unfortunately, this plan backfires massively, as Bond throws alcohol through the Shishkabobs and onto Mr. Kidd, instantly setting him on fire. ; World's Greatest Marching Band Cassette Tape : Tape used to control the laser satellite's movements. ; Industrial Satellite Laser : The final product of all the diamond smuggling throughout the movie. Built by light refraction expert Dr. Metz, this laser is activated by using several hundred diamonds to concentrate and amplify a laser beam strong enough to destroy ICBM facilities, submarines, and other strategic targets from outer space orbit. Blofeld uses this device to extort money from Washington DC. Similar devices appear in Goldeneye and in Die Another Day which are satellite weapons deployed from outer space. This device is also similar to most other laser devices throughout the Bond film series, with this one being the largest and most powerful laser to date. ; Blofeld's Mini-Sub/Wrecking Ball : Suspended on a Crane intended to be lowered down into the water, this was Blofeld's escape vehicle should his plan fail (and it does). Bond however intercepts Blofeld's escape and uses this Mini-Sub still suspended on a crane as a wrecking ball with Blofeld still inside the sub. =Never Say Never Again (non-Eon; 1983)= ; Pen gun : A fountain pen emblazoned with the Union Flag of the UK that can fire an explosive charge, albeit delayed. ; Rolex Wristwatch : Equipped with a small laser beam cutting tool. ; Motion-sensing bomb : Actually Bond's cigarette case, supposedly equipped with a gyroscope that would trigger the detonator when moved. Used to fool a henchman into letting 007 crash Largo's charity ball. This was the only time Bond improvised by inventing a fake gadget on the spot. David Niven era (1967) =Casino Royale (non-Eon; 1967)= ; Cigarette gun : Similar to the one used in the later Eon movie You Only Live Twice. Used by James Bond to kill the firing squad that tried to execute him in one scene. ; Sleeping pills. : Although these are used in hospitals today, Miss Goodthighs tried to knock out Evelyn Tremble before he could play baccarat against Le Chiffre. ; Suit with various gadgets in the pockets : Q tries to explain this to Evelyn Tremble, but he ignores him. ; Le Chiffre's torture room : Le Chiffre uses this to torture Tremble to get the cheque to his winnings. ; Bagpipe with hidden machine gun. : Used by Vesper Lynd to kill Tremble. ; Minox B 8x11 Camera : Used by Q. George Lazenby era (1969) =On Her Majesty's Secret Service= ; AR-7 .22 Survival Rifle: in the pre-credits opening scene, Bond opens the glovebox of his Aston Martin revealing a stored AR-7 buttstock (its barrel and receiver are normally stored within the buttstock), a detachable suppressor and a rifle scope. He grabs the scope and uses it to watch Tracy walk into the sea. An AR-7 is part of the standard kit given to double-0 agents per From Russia With Love. ; Radioactive lint: In the beginning of the movie, Q is showing M a homing device made out of regular lint. ; Safe cracker : A device that consists of a flexible cable ending in a grapple that is meant to be fitted on a typical safe combination lock. The machine would then examine the lock, figure out its combination and open the safe. In addition, the device sports an Olivetti wet-type photocopier that could allow for easy copying of secret documents to minimise the chance of the owner learning of the break in by missing documents. Wet-type photocopiers are actually unsuitable for field missions because they must not be tilted lest the highly toxic transfer liquid spills out. Unlike the safe cracker used in You Only Live Twice, this device was quite slow, taking close to an hour to open the safe (in the film, Bond uses the device while the safe's owner is on a lunch break and barely completes the job before the man returns). ; Minox Camera : Bond uses a small camera to take snap shots of a map that shows where the \\"Angels Of Death\\" are to release a biological agent. ; Angel of Death kit : The weapons and communications devices for the Angels of Death, ostensibly presented to them by Blofeld as a Christmas present. It includes a communications device disguised as a pocket mirror (so as to receive messages from Blofeld) and the deadly virus which Blofeld intends to use to destroy all food on Earth if the UN doesn't give in to his demands; the virus is disguised as a perfume spray. After Bond resigns from MI6, we see him cleaning out his desk, and gadgets from past films are shown, including Honey Ryder's knife from Dr. No, Red Grant's garotte watch from From Russia with Love and the miniature re-breather from Thunderball. Roger Moore era (1973‚Äì1985) =Live and Let Die= Although Major Boothroyd/Q and Q Branch are not present in this film, this film remains the most gadget heavy in the series. ; Pulse detonator : Used by one of Kananga's henchmen to kill Agent Dawes at the UN, by replacing his translation feed with the detonator and sending an explosive noise into his head, killing him instantly. ; Rolex Submariner : This specially modified Submariner has a powerful electromagnet that, in theory, can even deflect a bullet. The watch bezel also spins to operate like a mini circular saw that can cut ropes. ; Bug Sweeper : a hand-held device that can sweep a room for electronic microphones. ; Pre-Recorded Audio Device : Kananga uses a pre- recorded audio conversation of himself when he knows he's being monitored by the CIA. This allows him to do tasks while Felix Leiter thinks he's giving a speech. Bond uses a similar device later in A View to a Kill ; Clothing brush communicator : A lint brush with a communicator. It can also transmit messages in Morse code.This same prop later appeared (used in a similar manner) in the 1975 Doctor Who serial Revenge of the Cybermen. ; Shark gun : Fires special pellets that expel highly pressurised air to make the target explode. Although it is designed for combating sharks, Bond is able to activate a pellet manually before forcing Dr. Kananga to swallow it. ; The 'Felix Lighter' : Radio transmitter/receiver disguised as a car cigarette lighter installed in a CIA vehicle, which Bond uses to contact his friend, Felix Leiter. This is the first of the \\"Genuine Felix Lighter\\" items that Bond uses, the second being in the film License to Kill.. ; Robo-Samedi : for unknown reasons, this robotic replica of Baron Samedi pops out of the grave during the sacrificial voodoo scene of Solitaire. Bond quickly dispatches of this fake and the real Samedi appears. ; Flute communicator / flute radio: Baron Samedi uses this device as a regular flute and as a direct radio transmission communicator to Dr. Kananga ; Voodoo Figures : Found in the jungles of Dr. Kananga's island, they contain surveillance cameras as well as shoot poison darts at unwanted guests, as well as recently useless agents to Kananga such as Rosie Carver. ; Poisonous Snakes : Used several times throughout the film as weapons or for ceremonial purposes. Comes in many different shapes, sizes, and colors. ; Trap Door : Used in both the New Orleans location of Fillet of Soul restaurant and in \\"Voodooland\\" in San Monique to gain entrance to Mr. Big/Dr. Kananga's secret underground lair of operations. The San Monique trap door was initially only used to send the robotic Baron Samedi up through the cemetery to sentence the victim to death by snakes, and is triggered by a hat, a sword and a bell. Bond later tricks the trap door operator with the sword into allowing him and Solitaire inside. ; Bulletproof Glass in Taxi : used by one of Kananga's henchmen to prevent Bond and the recently defected Solitaire from escaping. ; Trick Coffin : Coffin like device with a false bottom that is used to pick up the recently deceased on the ground. Such was used on the murdered MI6 agent Hamilton, who was investigating a Fillet of Soul restaurant in New Orleans. ; Shoe Box Communicator : Used by another one of Kananga's henchmen posting as a shoe shiner in a network of surveillance personnel. ; Revolving Dinner Table : Installed at the Fillet of Soul location in New York, this revolving table brings both special and unexpected guests to the secret back room from where Mr. Big/Dr. Kananga operates. ; Prosthetic arm: Tee Hee's mechanical arm which contains a very strong claw capable of crushing and cutting through objects. ; Flamethrower Spray Can : In Bond's hotel room at San Monique, a snake appears. Bond quickly uses his Aftershave can with his cigar as a makeshift blowtorch to kill the snake. This is unusual as it was not a Q branch gadget. ; Trap Door Air Vent : A trap door designed to look like air vent. This device actually employs a low tech solution to killing Bond, which is a poisonous snake. This was completely undetectable by Bond's Bug Sweeper (see above). ; Side Mirror Dart Gun : Placed on the side mirror of Kananga's Cadillac Eldorado, this device was used to kill Bond's driver in New York City. ; Kananga Balloon : A very inflated version of Dr. Kananga. Bond makes Kananga swallow a compressed gas pellet making him inflate before exploding. There is evidence that this pellet contains helium or hydrogen (a gas lighter than air) as Kananga rises to the ceiling while inflated before he explodes. ; Coffin with Snakes : For ceremonial purposes, a coffin with snakes is present at the sacrificial ritual of Solitaire. Bond quickly tosses Baron Samedi into the coffin, but perhaps to no effect, as he is seen alive at the end of the film. ; Airplane with wings torn off : A small airplane with its wings torn off. Used to evade and chase Kananga's men around the airport. A similar vehicle would be used in the film Spectre. ; Monorail : A transportation system used by Dr. Kananga in his lair to move large amounts of his \\"shipments\\" out. Bond and Solitaire later use this mode of transportation to get out of Kananga's lair. ; Watertight Metal Containers : Each container is capable of carrying twenty cans of \\"shipment\\" weighing 25lbs each with a total of 500lbs and is watertight. Whisper later finds himself falling inside one of these containers after he meets with one of Bond's signature \\"Hanging Kick.\\" =The Man With The Golden Gun= Nearly all gadgets in this film belong to the main villain, Francisco Scaramanga. ; The Golden Gun: Scaramanga assembles his Golden Gun using a pen (which acts as the barrel) screwed into a cigarette lighter (which acts as the firing chamber), a cigarette case (which acts as the handle), and a cuff link (which acts as the trigger). This gun however is limited to only one bullet. ; Gold Bullets : Handcrafted by specialty munitions manufacturer Lazar, these are 4.2mm (an unusual size, slightly smaller than a .17 ACP) and made of 23-karat gold. The bullets flatten upon impact. This action, combined with Scaramanga's extraordinary marksmanship, expedites the rate of death of the victim ; 007 Gold Bullet and Bellydancing Trinket Gold Bullet : Although not gadgets themselves, these pieces of evidence were used to track down Scaramanga. The first bullet, with Bond's Double-O registry etched into it is later revealed to be sent not by Scaramanga or any of his contractors with a hit on Bond, but by Andrea Anders Scaramanga's mistress herself as a way to lure Bond into killing her Lover/Employer Scaramanga and setting her free from his world. Sadly this does not work as she ends up accidentally exposing herself and becomes a victim of one of Scaramanga's gold bullets. The Bellydancing Bullet came from another one of Scaramanga's victims, that being Bill Fairbanks agent 002. Bond tracks down the dancer who used the bullet as a bellydancing stomach trinket that was lodged in the wall after it was used to murder Fairbanks. ; Fake Nipple : Bond uses this as part of his disguise. ; Solex Agitator : Device that enables the utilization of solar energy as a power source on an industrial scale. ; Solar Power Plant : A facility developed by Scaramanga during his apprenticeship with Hi-Fat which utilizes the solar power from the Solex Agitatior. Scaramanga had plans to sell it to the highest bidder before the facility was destroyed indirectly by Goodnight. ; RMS Queen Elizabeth : A fully operational MI6 Facility located within the beached wreck of the RMS Queen Elizabeth. Contains areas to examine salvaged technology from opposing nations, as well as labs for Q Branch. ; Industrial Laser Cannon : A weapon that comes with the use of the solex agitator. Similar to the industrial lasers used by Auric Goldfinger and Blofeld, this weapon was used to destroy Bond's aircraft docked at Scaramanga's island. ; Tracking Device : Used to track Scaramanga's flying car ; Scaramanga's Fun Palace : Filled with replicas of historic figures significant to Scaramanga such as Al Capone as well as several moving mirrors and a Saloon. Also contains a replica of James Bond himself. ; Airplane Car Attachment : A pair of wings, tail section, and a turbine jet that comes as an attachment to Scaramanga's AMC Matador Coupe. Enables his vehicle to fly large distances. ; 007 Wax Dummy : A near exact duplicate of James Bond, complete with a retractable railing that at a push of a button would either advance or retreat out of the shadows. Used by Scaramanga as both a tool of admiration and target practice. Bond would later impersonate the dummy and kill Scaramanga when he was not looking. =The Spy Who Loved Me= Most of the gadgets in this film belong to, or are directly influenced by the main villain, Karl Stromberg. ; Jaws' Teeth : Made of stainless steel, his razor sharp teeth are what he uses to dispose of his victims by biting into their jugular. The strength of these \\"dentures\\" are also shown when he is able to bite through the skin of a shark and thus killing it. Its weakness however, being that it is made of steel, is that it is vulnerable to industrial-sized super-magnets which are normally used in junkyards to lift vehicles. In addition to this, Jaws himself has above average at 7'2\\" as well as above average strength. ; Micro-Film Reader : Assembled from two components: :*A cigarette case :*A cigarette lighter ; Ski pole gun : A specially designed ski pole which is modified to fire .30 calibre rounds from a four-shot magazine in the handle. ; Seiko Quartz watch : Basically working like a pager, it had a built-in telex that allowed MI6 to send important messages to Bond, printing them out like a miniature teleprinter. The tape bore some resemblance to label maker tape. ; Stun Gas Cigarette : The cigarette used by Soviet agent Triple X, could unleash a knockout blow of stun gas when blown through. ; MI6 Headquarters in Cairo : Disguised to resemble an Egyptian Temple, this facility houses the offices of MI6 as well as Q Branch division. The following gadgets were all being tested at the Q Branch area of the temple, with only one of them actually being used by Bond in the film. A list of the gadgets being tested is listed below: * Sharp Tea Tray * Hookah machine gun * Seats with booby trapped knives * Cement Blaster (later installed on The Lotus Esprit which Bond uses) ; Lotus Esprit car that converts into a submarine. ; Sharp Tea Tray : Although never used, it is shown tested in Q's lab, cutting off a mannequin's head. The tray, in conjunction with a magnetic levitation delivery system, was lethal. ; Nuclear ICBM Detonator : Another Atomic or Nuclear based weapon of mass destruction featured in a Bond Film. This device is responsible for detonating a nuclear warhead in an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. Equipped with a magnetic housing, Bond had to carefully remove the device which would have been rigged to explode if the Detonator came in contact with the magnetic areas of the housing. ; Submarine Tracking System and Microfilm : The initial object of Bond and Amasova's original mission in Cairo. The tracking system was developed at Stromberg's Facility, but was leaked by one of the developers in order to make an extra profit out of it. Stromberg sent Jaws to retrieve the blueprints to avoid any possible link to his company. Jaws however was unsuccessful in retrieving the blueprints. ; SS Liparus oil tanker : Not really an oil tanker, her massive size contains a launch bay in the fore section of the ship where 3 nuclear subs can be housed. Other high tech toys this ship conceals includes: *A mini monorail system from which the cars can be ejected out of a hatch on the side of the ship and convert into speedboats *A bulletproof control room with slots fitted for machine guns and flamethrowers for the Liparus crew to use against the submarine crews *Nuclear ICBM missiles *and the Submarine Tracking and Electrical Interference system used to capture the Soviet, British and American submarines. ; Monorail Boat : A mini-monorail car which would ferry people around the large areas of the SS Liparus which turns into a small boat when ejected out of the side of the vessel. ; Wet Bike aka \\"Wet Nellie\\" : Built by Q Branch, this Jet Ski that can be assembled and disassembled in a small amount of time, much like the \\"Little Nellie\\" gyrocopter from You Only Live Twice and fitted into a small duffel bag when disassembled ; Atlantis Sea Base : Stromberg's main base of operations located off the coast of Sardina, Italy. This gigantic sea base is capable of submersing and re-appearing above the surface of the water. A listing of its gadgets follows: *Waterproof Helipad, complete with clear dome that covers the landing area of visiting Helicopters when base is submerged *Sony Surveillance Monitor used to monitor several rooms of the sea base. Comes complete with button panel, in which the red button was used to destroy helicopter containing the inventors of the Submarine tracking system. Other buttons includes the one which operates the elevator the trap door *Trick Elevators with Trap Doors that lead to Shark Tank *Dinner Table Gun *Retracting Paintings that show monitors of Stromberg's Shark Tanks *Shark Tank *Large Aquarium with above average fish and other rare marine life inside *Giant Electromagnetetic Device, located above the Shark Tank for unknown reasons *Escape Pods, complete with champagne and bed *Large Scale Model of the SS Liparus (display purposes only) *Submarine Tracking System (also present in SS Liparus) =Moonraker= ; Jaws's Teeth : With the character of Jaws making a comeback appearance in this film due to his popularity, his trademark steel teeth came back as well. Although hardly used in this film, the strength of his teeth are shown when Jaws bites through a steel cable holding up a Cable Car. He also uses them to open a bottle of champagne for himself and Dolly when they fall back to Earth. ; Wrist dart gun : A dart gun concealed under the wearer's sleeve. ; Secret Laboratory : In Venice, the secret lab in which the nerve gas vials are constructed is hidden by a seemingly normal door on the outside.

This device was taken offline by Bond and Goodhead, which then gets the attention of NASA and then sends their own Space Shuttle to intercept. ; Nerve gas globes : The staple of Drax's plan to kill all of humanity. Bond accidentally discovers what they are in a Venetian laboratory (he accidentally kills two scientists after removing the nerve gas phial and it smashes). 50 globes are installed on the Moonraker Space Station, to be used to kill all of humanity in a \\"necklace of death\\". Three of them were launched; the other 47 were incinerated in the destruction of the space station. Bond and Goodhead take over Moonraker Shuttle #5 and use its laser to destroy the three globes already in space =For Your Eyes Only= ; Colombo's Dove Pins : A clothing pin with Milos Columbo's \\"Dove\\" logo on it. Used by Locque under orders from Kristatos to be placed on a recent murder scene he committed to frame Columbo. This pin was finally used against Locque when he drives nearly off a cliff with his car is hanging on the edge. Bond then throws the Dove Pin that he retrieved from his most recent murder of his contact Ferrara into Locque's car, causing his car to lose balance and fall off the cliff onto the rocks below (with some help from Bond himself kicking the car). ; Seiko Wristwatch : Receives digital message read-outs and contains a 2-way radio/transmitter for voice communications. ; \\"Remote Control Airways\\" : Also known as a Remote Control Helicopter, this term was made up by Ernst Stavro Blofeld as he takes Bond on a wild ride in this Helicopter. This helicopter is seemingly an ordinary one, except that it is remotely controlled by Blofeld himself. ; Blofeld's Motorized Wheelchair with Helicopter Interface : Installed on Blofeld's motorized wheelchair, this interface comes with a helicopter instrument panel complete with gauges, flight controls, and TV monitor displays that are used in conjunction with video cameras placed both on the front of the helicopter and one inside to monitor the cabin's occupants. This allows Blofeld to pilot the Helicopter without being inside of it. It also contains a switch which remotely kills the current pilot through an electrical shock to his headset. ; Arm Cast : Developed by Q-Branch, but not used in the field. This would look like an ordinary cast on a broken arm, except that it can also be used on an assailant coming from the back by springing out and bashing the purpotrator. ;Table Umbrella : An ordinary outdoor table umbrella used by Bond as a makeshift parachute to slow down his descent when jumping off a high wall at Hector Gonzales' compound. ; Spiked umbrella : Also developed by Q-Branch but not used in the field, this normal looking umbrella would have hooked spikes come out of the edges and close on the victim's neck when rain pours on the top. ; Identigraph: A system used at MI6 to construct the face of henchman Emile Leopold Locque. ; Explosive Anti-Theft Device : Installed in Bond's Lotus Esprit, this anti-theft device provides a warning on the drivers side window not to break it, and a following deadly explosion when someone attempts to break into the car. ; Console buttons : Comes with the rebuilt version of the Lotus Esprit, this time without the Explosive Anti-Theft device. Buttons were never used nor were their functions revealed. ; SS St. Georges : A seemingly ordinary and functional fishing vessel which houses a complete spy facility in its lower decks. This is also where the ATAC device is stored and utilized. The covert nature of this vessel proved useless as both the Soviet Government and Kristatos were aware of its true nature and whereabouts. ; ATAC : The Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator, or ATAC, was lost when the British spy ship St. Georges was sunk. This device controls all of Britain's Polaris ICBM nuclear submarines and can render them either inoperative or co- ordinate the use of them against major western cities or against Britain herself. Later recovered by Bond, who at the end destroys it to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. ; Barnett Commando Crossbow : Melina Havelock, who is there with her crossbow to avenge her parents‚Äô death. ; Monitoring Device : Used by Columbo to monitor conversations between Bond and Kristatos. ; Pistachios : A food item that Columbo smuggles.

General Koskov was placed inside this pod and smuggled into Austria at above average speeds; Bond says he's the first person to travel in such a manner. ; Rake Scanner : Used by MI6 operatives posing as Groundskeepers on the headquarters front lawn. This device looks like a normal gardening rake but acts as a sensor to monitor the grounds. ; Fake Blood Packs and Bulletproof Vest: Used by General Leonid Pushkin, these Fake Blood Packs were used to assist in faking his own death by gunshots. Several of these were strapped to his chest and one small pack in his mouth to fake bleeding in that area.

It can also take x-ray pictures. ; Exploding Alarm Clock : Q carries it with him to Isthmus, but it is not used. \\"Guaranteed never to wake up anybody who uses it.\\" ; Broom radio: used by Q to communicate with Bond's companion while disguised as a grounds man. Q throws this item away after using it. ; Genuine \\"Felix\\" Lighter : A gift from Felix Leiter's wedding, an inscribed cigarette lighter that malfunctions, causing a huge flame to burst forth (although it could be that it is a mini-flamethrower). It is first and the final special device used in this film reminding the main villain Franz Sanchez why he destroyed his criminal empire to begin with. Bond uses to kill Sanchez, by setting him on fire after his body is coated in petrol. This item is different than the similarly named \\"Felix Lighter\\" used in Live and Let Die. ; Manta Ray over- cover : used to disguise Bond as a Manta Ray when infiltrating Krest's ship ; Decompression Chamber : Used for deep sea divers to help them decompress after diving in deep waters, this device was also used as a weapon of execution by Sanchez. Milton Krest's ship, the Wavekrest, had one, and was used by Bond to frame Krest for stealing Sanchez' money. Krest then found out the hard way how a Decompression chamber could be used as a weapon, as he was stuffed in it and Sanchez rapidly compressed and decompressed it, which caused Krest to messily explode everywhere. ; Petrol with Cocaine : Disguised as Gasoline, Sanchez planned to sell his drugs to the orientals disguised as gasoline, but really containing the cocaine. ; Ninjas : A small group of Ninjas were used to capture Bond and send him back to Headquarters. They had small smoke bombs as well as nets that they shot out of their wrists. ; Conveyor Belt & Shredder : Used to break apart large blocks of cocaine into smaller pieces. Dario nearly kills Bond with the Shredder, however with Pam Bouvier's help, Bond tosses Dario into the Shredder. ; Decorative stone dolphin : Technically not a gadget, as it is simply a decorative stone dolphin with a light in its eye, for the swimming pool seen at the end of the film. It is seen 'winking' at the viewer at the very end (with the help of a motorised shutter going over the light) ; Helicopter landing tunnel : A massive, vertical, steel tunnel which allows helicopters to take off and land at Sanchez's drug refinery. Its entrance is disguised by a gigantic panel operated by hydraulics whilst the rest of the tunnel is hidden by Professor Butcher's meditation retreat. Pierce Brosnan era (1995‚Äì2002) =GoldenEye= ; Belt: A size 34 leather belt. It conceals a piton gun hidden behind the buckle. It can fire out up to of high tensile wire designed to support the weight of an average person. Used by Bond to flee the Russian military archives building in St. Petersburg after Natalya is captured by General Ourumov and his men. ; Ballpoint pen (Parker Jotter): Contains a class-four grenade. A four-second fuse is armed after three clicks in succession. Another three clicks disarms it.

It is possible that this helicopter utilizes Zorin Microchip technology from A View to a Kill ; Digital binoculars: Auto focus/zoom, digital camera, satellite uplink to send visual data. ; X-ray document scanner: Q has a document scanner disguised as a tea-tray. ; Phone booth trap: Q Branch is testing a BT telephone box with a large airbag inside which expands and crushes the person inside. ; Wheelchair and leg cast missile: Tested by Q Branch, this gadget was made to look like someone had broken their leg, when in fact, the leg hid a missile, which could be fired from the seated position. ; Door decoder: Small device that can be fitted onto keypad locked electronic doors that finds the combination and displays it on its screen. Used by 006 in the pre-credit sequence. ; Ejector seat: An ejector seat disguised as an ordinary office chair. Adjusting it will blast the chair across a distance. Is only seen whilst Q is telling Bond to bring everything back in pristine condition. ; Goldeneye satellite: An orbital satellite based weapon capable of delivering high powered electro-magnetic shock waves which can shut down any electronic operation on Earth. Alec Trevalyan controls the satellite in Cuba with the intention of using it on London, ruining its economy and thus causing chaos (only after he's robbed the entire Bank of England through his hacker employee Boris Grishenko). ; Trevelyan's Cuban radar dish base: A gigantic radar installation used by Trevelyan to control the movements of the Goldeneye satellite. The radar dish alone is so large that when submerged in water, it would resemble a small lake thus concealing its whereabouts. This facility comes complete with surface-to-air missiles that would destroy any unwelcomed visitors from the air while submerged. This is similar to Blofeld's volcano base where the outer cover of the retractable roof is painted to resemble lake water. The dish used in the movie is an actual working radio telescope: the Aricebo telescope in Puerto Rico. It was also featured in Contact. =Tomorrow Never Dies= ; Ericsson JB988 (mobile phone): This was a concept phone designed by Ericsson. The phone had a variety of features, including: :* a stun gun, containing a 20,000 Volt shock to any unauthorised user, and is also handy at disabling a high tech door lock. :* a fingerprint scanner/analyser/transmitter that can also be used for opening high-tech fingerprint-identification locks :* Antennae lock pick, which detaches from the phone and when inserted into a keyhole, hitting a key on the phone can then open the lock. :* \\"Flip-open\\" remote control for operating his BMW 750iL (Directional steering pad, LCD monitor for the front and rear view, controls to fire rocket launcher and operate the car's other defence mechanisms) : Much of the phone's style, including its \\"flip-open\\" design, was incorporated a few years later into the Ericsson R380, an early smartphone. The R380 combined a fully functional mobile phone, PDA-like tools and WAP services. ; Omega Seamaster watch: Taken by Bond from the Chinese safehouse, the watch had a small, detachable charge that could be detonated by turning the watch's dial. It was later used to remotely destroy a glass jar that had a grenade lodged inside. ; Cigarette lighter: A disguised timed explosive/grenade. ; Spike fan: Weapon developed by Wai Lin's counterpart division to Q Branch. Appears to be a Chinese fan, but when opened, several metal spikes with strings attached are thrown. Due to its brief appearance with no additional explanation, it is unclear whether the strings are for entanglement or a similar purpose like a taser, or to retract the spikes. ; Rickshaw defence mechanism: This was used to knock out an enemy. A button is pressed, and an upper part of a bike-based rickshaw, which appears to be parked, ejects, knocking out the target. ; Dragon flamethrower: Bond commented on the fact that this device was \\"very novel.\\" Although this appears to be a sculpture of a dragon's head, pulling back one of the horns emits a high yield flamethrower, which makes the sculpture look like a fire-breathing dragon. ; Wristband grappling hook: A wristband that shoots a grappling hook that Wai Lin uses to escape a building in the beginning ; Earring lock pick: At least one of Wai Lin's earrings conceals a lock pick, which she uses to escape from a pair of handcuffs. ; Sea-Vac drill: Used by Elliot Carver to destroy anything in his path‚Äîonly to fall victim to it himself. =The World Is Not Enough= ; Omega Seamaster wristwatch: Contains a grappling hook with fifty feet of high-tensile micro- filament and a high intensity lighted bezel. ; Multifunction lock pick: Concealed in a normal-looking credit card with a removable strip that activates a spring-loaded multifunction lock pick. ; Explosive eyeglasses: Remotely detonates a flash-bang.

This device uses satellite thermo-imaging on a large display screen to show heat signatures coming from various objects including people. MI6 staff was treated to a surprise when they did finally find Bond and Dr. Jones on their thermo-locator. ; Industrial-sized circular saw: Helicopter mounted circular saw assembly. Helicopters carrying these fly by and trim tree foliage. Two of these helicopters are sent to attack Bond and destroy his BMW. ; Garrotte chair: A chair which can hold a person at their neck, torso, wrists and ankles. Equipped with a seemingly-harmless knob at neck level, which can kill somebody slowly and painfully, as Bond nearly found out, if not for Zukosky's intervention. ; Walking stick gun: A seemingly ordinary ornate-looking walking cane used by Valentin Zukosky. Doubles as a gun with a trigger built into the handle. Used by Zukovsky to rescue Bond from the garotte. This film marks the only one occasion in the Bond film series where Bond has expressed concern as to what Q will think when equipment is destroyed \\"Q's not gonna like this!\\" when his BMW Z8 is sawn in half. This takes place after Major Boothroyd's final appearance in the film series; Desmond Llewelyn was killed in a car accident before the next film began production. =Die Another Day= ; Single Digit Sonic Agitator : A \\"standard issue\\" ring for the finger which is actually an \\"ultra high-frequency single digit sonic agitator unit\\" that can shatter bullet-proof glass (or any \\" 'unbreakable' glass\\", as commented by Q in the movie) or disable another person. ; Surfboard : Contains a sliding panel with a hidden compartment containing communications equipment, explosives, detonators and a Walther P99 pistol. ; Omega Seamaster Wristwatch : Omega Seamaster 300M Chronometer - Contains an explosive detonator and laser beam cutter. The new Q states that this watch is Bond's 20th, which is a reference to the fact that Die Another Day is the 20th James Bond film. ; Dream simulator:Gustav Graves uses this device to have dreams as he has insomnia. ; Mini Air Supply : Similar device as used in Thunderball, which provides a few minutes of oxygen. ; Virtual Combat Training Simulator: This device allows the user to enter a virtual environment with the assistance of four computerised columns, a special pair of sunglasses, and a special weapon. This training simulator is tested by 007. One such program contains a scenario in which MI6 Headquarters is attacked and the user must eliminate all threats as they see fit. Miss Moneypenny makes some recreational use of another version of the program, where she is romancing with James Bond over a desk. ; Invisible car: Uses cameras and small screens to cloak itself. Daniel Craig era (2006-present) Since the reboot of the franchise with Casino Royale, the character of Q and his lab had been absent from the films until Skyfall. =Casino Royale= ; Sony Ericsson K800 : Mobile phone with sophisticated GPS and 3.2 megapixel digital camera, with the ability to take multiple pictures very rapidly. ;Sony Ericsson M600 ; Microchip implant : Bond is implanted with a microchip that helps MI6 keep track of Bond's whereabouts; it also monitors Bond's vital signs which are transmitted back to MI6 for analysis. ; Tracking device : Similar to the implant in Bond's arm, this tracking device is placed in Le Chiffre's inhaler. ; Omega Seamaster wristwatch : Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean and Omega Seamaster Professional 300M. ; Explosive keychain : Originally used in the attempt to destroy a commercial airliner in Miami. The detonator for the explosive is concealed in a cell phone. Bond removes this from the fuel lorry and attaches it to Carlos' belt loop. Carlos then realises, too late, that he is about to explode. ; Defibrillator in glove compartment =Quantum of Solace= ; Walther PPK : The Walther PPK returns, after having been replaced at the end of Tomorrow Never Dies by the P99. ; Sony Ericsson C902 : This mobile phone has a built in identification imager, capable of compiling a composite facial image of a potential suspect even when the person being photographed is looking to the side. This phone can also receive information immediately regarding the suspect as it is also tied into the MI6 data mainframe. ; Omega Seamaster wristwatch : Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean ; MI6 Profile Touchscreen / multi-touch table : Similar to the Microsoft Surface, this tool used by MI6 gathers information regarding possible suspects in an investigation, and relays it back to Bond through his mobile phone. ; Quantum Earpiece : A Q-shaped earpiece that 007 uses to listen in on Dominic Greene and his plots. =Skyfall= ; Walther PPK/S 9mm short : A version equipped with a palm-print reader, only enabling the gun to fire when it detects Bond's palm-print. ; Radio transmitter : A simple radio transmitter that allows MI6 to track Bond's location when activated. Bond expresses his disappointment at the poor selection of gadgets at his disposal from the new Q (Ben Whishaw), who explains that Q branch no longer go in for \\"exploding pens\\". Regardless, that simple gadget proves invaluable when it secretly leads M.I.-6 to Silva's lair where he is holding Bond prisoner. ; Sony Xperia T ; Omega Seamaster wristwatch : Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean and Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra ; Lightbulb Bombs : Built by M herself, these self-made explosive devices contain a broken lightbulb inside a small plastic bag filled with kerosene and small bits of screws and other small bits of scrap metal. When attached to a light bulb socket and switched on by intruders, they explode sending large flames and bits of scrap metal flying everywhere. ; Hunting knife : Provided as a melee weapon by Skyfall's groundskeeper Kincade, for old-fashion means should Bond fail with the rest of his arsenal. He later uses it to kill Raoul Silva, by throwing it into his back. ; Internet messages : Sent by Silva to M's computer. One was a superimposed black-and-white photo of M on the Union Flag, the other was a one-armed bandit casino machine which showed five skulls, before showing M a YouTube video of five exposed MI6 agents, and the threat of \\"five more, every week\\". Both carried the same stark message: \\"Think On Your Sins\\". ; Silva's prosthetic : A prosthetic device used by Silva to mask his deformed face following his suicide attempt in 1997 when he was exchanged to the Chinese, under M, in exchange for other MI6 agents' release. The device chiefly consists of a denture for Silva's upper jaw, masking his rotten teeth, as well as a titanium arm that inflates his sunken left cheek and drooping eyelid on the same side, as well as presumed inbuilt devices to give him a Hispanic tan, help him breathe with inhalers and help him speak with an Electrolarynx. =Spectre= ; Smart blood: Implanted into Bond, the nanoparticles allows Q Branch to monitor his whereabouts via Satellite GPS. ; Omega Seamaster wristwatch : Omega Seamaster 300 (special Spectre limited edition) with two-tone NATO strap. Built in explosive charge with a one-minute timer. The real watch is magnetic-resistant up to 15,000 Gauss ; SPECTRE ring : When analyzed by Q, it revealed data information about the Spectre organization. The ring is also used by members to gain admission to staff meetings. ; L'Americain Hotel Secret Room : A room of operations built by Mr. White in a Hotel room. The room contained various gadgets and information he used while working with Spectre. It also provided the co-ordinates to the Spectre base in Morocco. ; Dentist Chair : Containing two small drills that Blofeld uses remotely to drill into Bond's head (non fatally). Also comes with an X-Ray monitor. ; Nine Eyes Surveillance System : An automated surveillance technology system secretly funded by Spectre and used by \\"C\\" (head of Joint Intelligence Services) as a means of creating an intelligence network between the United Kingdom and eight other countries. Also as a means of ending the Double 0 program and securing Spectre from their threats as well as gathering information for that organization. ; Spectre Facility Morocco : Spectre's base of operations in the Moroccan Desert. Built into a meteor crater, this facility's decor resembles that of the Eco Hotel from the film Quantum of Solace. This facility possibly contains more gadgets. ; Beer Kegs : Not technically a gadget but used as one. Bond attaches a chain to Mr. Hinx that linked a series of Beer Kegs as they were being dropped out of a moving train, thus taking Mr. Hinx with him. ; Laser microphone attached to Bond's SMG in operation in Mexico. ; Mr. Hinx's thumbnails : Metal thumbnails on Mr. Hinx's thumbs. Served no apparent purpose other than for aesthetic and decorative reasons.

Lunar New Year decoration. Easter postcard (Germany, 1902) Pussy willow is a name given to many of the smaller species of the genus Salix (willows and sallows) when their furry catkins are young in early spring. These species include (among many others): *Goat willow or goat sallow (Salix caprea), a small tree native to northern Europe and northwest Asia. *Grey willow or grey sallow (Salix cinerea), a small tree native to northern Europe. *American pussy willow (Salix discolor), native to northern North America. Before the male catkins of these species come into full flower they are covered in fine, greyish fur, leading to a fancied likeness to tiny cats, also known as ‚Äúpussies‚Äù. The catkins appear long before the leaves, and are one of the earliest signs of spring. At other times of year trees of most of these species are usually known by their ordinary names. Cultural traditions =Asia= The many buds of the pussy willow make it a favourite flower for Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year). The fluffy white blossoms of the pussy willow resemble silk, and they soon give forth young shoots the colour of green jade. In Chinese tradition, this represents the coming of prosperity. Towards the Lunar New Year period in spring, stalks of the plant may be bought from wet market vendors or supermarkets. Once unbundled within one's residence, the stalks are frequently decorated with gold and red ornaments‚Äîornaments with colours and textures that signify prosperity and happiness. Felt pieces of red, pink, and yellow are also a common decoration in Southeast Asia. Xie Daoyun's comparison of snow and willow catkins is a famous line of poetry and is used to refer to precocious young female poets. =Europe= The flowering shoots of pussy willow are used both in Europe and America for spring religious decoration on Palm Sunday, as a replacement for palm branches, which do not grow that far north. Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox; Ruthenian, Polish, Romanian, Czech, Slovak, Bavarian, and Austrian Roman Catholics; Finnish and Baltic Lutherans and Orthodox; and various other Eastern European peoples carry pussy willows on Palm Sunday instead of palm branches. This custom has continued to this day among Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Romanian Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Ruthenian Catholic, Ukrainian Catholic, Kashubian Catholic and Polish Catholic √©migr√©s to North America. Sometimes, on Palm Sunday they will bless both palms and pussy willows in church. The branches will often be preserved throughout the year in the family's icon corner. Pussy willow also plays a prominent role in Polish Dyngus Day (Easter Monday) observances, continued also among Polish-Americans, especially in the Buffalo, New York, area. =Middle East= In Greater Iran it may be part of the decoration on the Haft-Seen table during the new year celebration of Nowruz on the first day of spring, and its distilled flower is used in traditional medicine. In popular culture Pussy Willow, a children's book by Margaret Wise Brown (1951), tells the story of a grey \\"pussycat not much bigger than a pussywillow\\", who names himself Pussy Willow after the catkins he finds around him in Spring. When the catkins disappear with the passing of the season, he goes in search of them, asking each different kind of animal he encounters where he might find them. The animals all answer from their own perspective. Up in the air, says the butterfly; under a leaf, says the squirrel. Pussy Willow finally finds them a year later when Spring comes around again. The original edition was illustrated by Leonard Weisgard. In the book The Best Christmas Pageant Ever by Barbara Robinson, the character Imogene Herdman argues with a girl named Alice over which of them will play the Virgin Mary in their school's upcoming Christmas pageant. Imogene threatens to stick a pussy willow down Alice's ear where no one would be able to reach it, and says: \\"And it'll sit there and grow and grow and grow. So for the rest of your life, there'll be a pussy willow bush growing out of your ear.\\" \\"Pussy Willow\\" is a song by progressive rock group Jethro Tull on their album The Broadsword and the Beast.

Ullman, its inventors, for translating abstract syntax trees into machine code that uses as few registers as possible. Overview When generating code for arithmetic expressions, the compiler has to decide which is the best way to translate the expression in terms of number of instructions used as well as number of registers needed to evaluate a certain subtree. Especially in the case that free registers are scarce, the order of evaluation can be important to the length of the generated code, because different orderings may lead to larger or smaller numbers of intermediate values being spilled to memory and then restored. The Sethi‚ÄìUllman algorithm (also known as Sethi‚ÄìUllman numbering) produces code which needs the fewest instructions possible as well as the fewest storage references (under the assumption that at the most commutativity and associativity apply to the operators used, but distributive laws i.e. a * b + a * c = a * (b + c) do not hold). Please note that the algorithm succeeds as well if neither commutativity nor associativity hold for the expressions used, and therefore arithmetic transformations can not be applied. The algorithm also does not take advantage of common subexpressions or apply directly to expressions represented as general directed acyclic graphs rather than trees. Simple Sethi‚ÄìUllman algorithm The simple Sethi‚ÄìUllman algorithm works as follows (for a load/store architecture): # Traverse the abstract syntax tree in pre- or postorder ## For every non-constant leaf node, assign a 1 (i.e. 1 register is needed to hold the variable/field/etc.) if it is the left child of its parent else assign a 0. For every constant leaf node (RHS of an operation ‚Äì literals, values), assign a 0. ## For every non-leaf node n, assign the number of registers needed to evaluate the respective subtrees of n. If the number of registers needed in the left subtree (l) are not equal to the number of registers needed in the right subtree (r), the number of registers needed for the current node n is max(l, r). If l  r, then the number of registers needed for the current node is r + 1\\\\. # Code emission ## If the number of registers needed to compute the left subtree of node n is bigger than the number of registers for the right subtree, then the left subtree is evaluated first (since it may be possible that the one more register needed by the right subtree to save the result makes the left subtree spill). If the right subtree needs more registers than the left subtree, the right subtree is evaluated first accordingly. If both subtrees need equal as much registers, then the order of evaluation is irrelevant. =Example= For an arithmetic expression a = (b + c+ f * g) * (d + 3), the abstract syntax tree looks like this: = / \\\\ a * / \\\\ / \\\\ \\\\+ + / \\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ d 3 \\\\+ * / \\\\ / \\\\ b c f g To continue with the algorithm, we need only to examine the arithmetic expression (b + c + f * g) * (d + 3), i.e. we only have to look at the right subtree of the assignment '=': * / \\\\ / \\\\ \\\\+ + / \\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ d 3 \\\\+ * / \\\\ / \\\\ b c f g Now we start traversing the tree (in preorder for now), assigning the number of registers needed to evaluate each subtree (note that the last summand in the expression (b + c + f * g) * (d + 3) is a constant): *2 / \\\\ / \\\\ +2 +1 / \\\\ / \\\\ / \\\\ d1 30 +1 *1 / \\\\ / \\\\ b1 c0f1 g0 From this tree it can be seen that we need 2 registers to compute the left subtree of the '*', but only 1 register to compute the right subtree. Nodes 'c' and 'g' do not need registers for the following reasons: If T is a tree leaf, then the number of registers to evaluate T is either 1 or 0 depending whether T is a left or a right subtree (since an operation such as add R1, A can handle the right component A directly without storing it into a register). Therefore we shall start to emit code for the left subtree first, because we might run into the situation that we only have 2 registers left to compute the whole expression. If we now computed the right subtree first (which needs only 1 register), we would then need a register to hold the result of the right subtree while computing the left subtree (which would still need 2 registers), therefore needing 3 registers concurrently. Computing the left subtree first needs 2 registers, but the result can be stored in 1, and since the right subtree needs only 1 register to compute, the evaluation of the expression can do with only 2 registers left. Advanced Sethi‚ÄìUllman algorithm In an advanced version of the Sethi‚ÄìUllman algorithm, the arithmetic expressions are first transformed, exploiting the algebraic properties of the operators used.

MOSI's funding comes from private donations, corporate sponsors, and support from Hillsborough County and the City of Tampa. History MOSI began in 1962 when Hillsborough County first approved funding for a youth museum in Sulphur Springs. Named the Museum of Science and Natural History, it provided natural science exhibits and education programs to children and adults. The name of the museum was changed to the Hillsborough County Museum in 1967. In 1976, the Hillsborough County Museum's advisory committee and staff started construction on a new museum in North Tampa that was to become the Museum of Science & Industry. The museum was completed in 1980 and permanently opened to the public on January 23, 1982. In 1995 the construction of the 190,000 square foot science center with Florida's only IMAX Dome Theatre, extensive permanent and temporary exhibition galleries, a planetarium and a public library was completed. Further renovations were done in 1996, 2001, and 2005. MOSI was the largest science center in the southeast and the 5th largest in the U.S.MOSI'S HISTORY AND FUTURE On August 13, 2017, MOSI closed 85% of their building and their IMAX theater to save money. Many exhibits were removed and the remaining exhibits were relocated to the previous \\"Kids in Charge\\" section of the museum. Accreditation The Museum of Science & Industry was re-accredited in April 2008 by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). MOSI was the 2009 recipient of the National Medal for Museums for the Institute of Museums and Library Services, which is the highest national award given to museums. Educational Programs and Camps MOSI offers S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) powered programs for all ages from preschool to seniors. MOSI's Science Camps are open when school is out of session including winter breaks and summer. MOSI offers summer educational camps usually lasting from June through August. These camps range in various scientific topics from snorkeling in natural springs to using DNA to solve crimes to designing video games. Teens can explore careers in fields such as art, technology, math, engineering or science at the S.T.E.A.M. Career Camp. Attendees receive a S.T.E.A.M.

Several thousand native Florida butterflies are raised each year in a publicly viewable laboratory. These butterflies include the zebra longwing - Florida state butterfly, and the giant swallowtail and the tiger swallowtail - two of the largest North American butterflies. The zebra longwing butterfly The pond and large white tanks in front of the garden are part of a model wastewater treatment facility designed to purify wastewater in a simulated wetland environment. Waste water is fed through pumps into a series of underground anaerobic and aerobic purification tanks where waste particles are broken down by bacteria. The water is then pumped into a series of above ground aerobic tanks and then into a settling tank, called the clarifier, which settles remaining solids out of the water for further processing. The clean water is then chlorinated to remove remaining bacteria and then dechlorinated to remove chemicals that will be harmful to plant and animal life. Finally, the clean water is pumped back into a fish pond and the cycle continues. Of the fish in the pond, the tilapia are the most unusual. The tilapia are the third, fourth and fifth generations of descendants of the first fish born in space. This fish, named Amigo, was born on John Glenn's last space mission, STS-95, and was returned to earth so that its reproduction could be observed. =The Amazing You!= MetLife Foundation's Amazing You! is a exhibition about health and wellness at each developmental life stage.

Cartoons character created by Friz Freleng, best known from Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies animated shorts of the 1950s and 1960s. She is the owner of Tweety (and more often than not, Sylvester and Hector). Her voice was first provided by Bea Benaderet from 1950 through 1955, then by June Foray for almost 60 years.  Biography  Granny is a good-natured widow who is extremely protective of her beloved canary, Tweety. Granny's overprotectiveness becomes apparent whenever Tweety is threatened, usually by Sylvester. Although having the appearance of a kindly old woman, Granny has demonstrated her cleverness in many cartoons. At least until the mid-1950s, Granny is depicted as an elderly spinster who wears spectacles, a gray bun and a late 19th-century-like schoolmarm dress; other old fashioned characteristics include her mode of transportation (usually, a Ford Model T or a horse and buggy) and her inability to relate to present fads (such as her telling Tweety she's about to try on a new \\"bikini bathing suit\\", which turns out to be a full one-piece outfit from the turn-of- the-20th century). After 1955 ‚Äî in particular, the years after Foray began voicing the character ‚Äî the character's wardrobe was updated and her old- fashioned tastes and ways of life were de-emphasized, and she was sometimes given newer careers, such as a nurse or a bus driver.  Appearances  The idea of the cartoon Granny began with the Little Red Riding Hood character in spoofs of the story, first appearing as such in the 1937 animated short Little Red Walking Hood which featured Egghead, directed by Tex Avery. Subsequent appearances of a similar \\"granny\\" character included The Cagey Canary (1941), directed by Bob Clampett; Hiss and Make Up (1943), directed by Friz Freleng; and Hare Force (1944), featuring Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the dog (a one-off character distinct from the later Sylvester the cat). Finally, the character was solidified into her current role in Canary Row in 1950, with Bea Benaderet providing her voice. June Foray, who had been providing Granny's voice for her appearances on Capitol Records since 1950, took over the role officially in 1955, and would perform the role for most of the rest of the character's theatrical run. Granny would continue to appear in several more animated shorts from the 1950s on, as a foil for Sylvester the Cat, who was always attempting to eat her pet bird Tweety. Foray did not voice Granny for her last two theatrical shorts, possibly for budgetary reasons; Ge Ge Pearson and Joan Gerber each voiced the character in one short, both of which were released in 1965. Foray would return to the role in later television productions. = Solo = Although she was almost always shown onscreen with at least one of her two animal companions, Granny could occasionally be seen in an animated short without them. For example, in the 1953 short Hare Trimmed, she starred as a rich widow who was being fought over by two suitors, Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny (the latter out to thwart the former's evil plan to marry her and then get her money). Sam called her \\"Emma\\" and later \\"Emmy\\". Another one was the 1965 short Corn on the Cop (1965), where she appears alongside Daffy Duck and Porky Pig as two Keystone Cops who mistake her for a crook disguised like her. She is in this story addressed as \\"Mrs. Webster\\" by a passing policeman. = Later = She has appeared as a professor at Acme Looniversity and the mentor and favorite teacher of Mary Melody in Tiny Toon Adventures, a regular character in The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, and a timekeeper in Bugs Bunny and Taz Time Busters. Granny and Witch Hazel donned cheerleader uniforms for the Toonsquad in the movie Space Jam, and she was the children's grandmother and new character Floyd's aunt in Baby Looney Tunes. She made two cameo appearance in Looney Tunes: Back in Action as the main character's next door neighbor, although in one of those appearances this \\"Granny\\" was actually the Acme Chairman in disguise. She also appeared in Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas and in Tweety's High-Flying Adventure. An episode of Loonatics Unleashed featured characters named Queen Grannicus (voiced by Candi Milo), the Royal Tweetums and Sylth Vester (the latter being a parody of Darth Vader). However, another episode features a cameo of Granny herself, apparently still alive in the year 2772. Granny was going to have a cameo in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but was later dropped for unknown reasons. In The Looney Tunes Show, Granny is one of Bugs and Daffy's neighbors and is voiced again by Foray while her younger self is voiced by Stephanie Courtney, and Sylvester and Tweety are her pets. This version of Granny seems to be somewhat hard-of-hearing and slightly senile. A running gag is that Sylvester is constantly chasing Tweety around her house, to which Granny seems oblivious. In \\"Eligible Bachelors\\", it is revealed that during World War II, Granny/Emma was a member of the WAC and along with Tweety she stopped Nazi Colonel Frankenheimer from stealing the Eiffel Tower and various paintings from the Louvre. During the flashback of her World War II adventure to Daffy, she appears as an attractive red-headed young woman in a WAC uniform. In \\"The Grand Old Duck of York,\\" it is revealed that Granny teaches piano lessons when Daffy wants to learn how to play the piano. Granny made recurring appearances in New Looney Tunes, voiced by Candi Milo. Granny also made appearances in Looney Tunes Cartoons, once again voiced by Candi Milo.

His first training in the subject of engineering was at the Chemnitz K√∂nigliche Gewerbeschule (Royal Vocational School), today Chemnitz University of Technology, where he studied from 1843-1848. In 1848 he moved the short distance to the Bergakademie (Mining Academy) in Freiberg, today also a university of technology, where he studied mining and metallurgy. He developed close links with one of his professors, the famous mineralogist Albin Julius Weisbach, with whom he worked on several projects. The university course was disrupted, however, during the revolutions which took place all over Germany. Large popular assemblies and mass demonstrations took place, primarily demanding freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, arming of the people, and a national German parliament. Zeuner joined the revolutionaries on the barricades in Dresden during the May Uprising in 1849. Unlike many of his compatriots, some of whom were sentenced to death or sent to the workhouse, Zeuner was pardoned. He was able to complete his course, and even completed his PhD at the University of Leipzig in 1853, but was banned from ever teaching at any Saxon university. =Escape to Z√ºrich= In 1853, Zeuner took over as the editor of the engineering magazine \\"Der Civilenginieur. Zeitschrift f√ºr das Ingenieurwesen\\", the first German magazine specialising in mechanics, which ran until 1896. He continued in this position until 1857, even after moving to Z√ºrich in 1855 to work as a professor for technical mechanics at the ETH Z√ºrich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich. There he worked alongside famous engineers such as Franz Reuleaux. Other Dresden revolutionaries had fled their home country for Z√ºrich (Richard Wagner, Gottfried Semper, Theodor Mommsen). It was in Z√ºrich that Zeuner made his model of a locomotive front end in 1858; he recognised its potential for creating momentum but was only interested in the theory and did not develop the design any further. Also in Z√ºrich (in 1869) Zeuner invented the three- dimensional population graph now sometimes known as a Zeuner diagram but more often as a Lexis diagram after Wilhelm Lexis who modified the idea slightly. From 1859 Zeuner worked the stand-in director of the ETH Z√ºrich, and in May 1865 he took over the position officially. His former professor, Albin Weisbach, commemorated his friend's acquisition of the post by naming a mineral after him - the transparent green crystal zeunerite.http://www.mindat.org/min-4397.html Mindat =Return to Germany= Zeuner, c. 1886 In 1871 Zeuner returned to Germany and was once again able to work with Weisbach when he succeeded his old friend as director of the Freiberg Mining Academy. He also taught there until 1875 as a professor of mechanics and the study of mining machinery. This was now possible, despite the teaching ban which had been placed on him, because of the amnesty granted to all the revolutionaries in 1862. In 1873, while still director of Freiberg Mining Academy, Zeuner also took on the post of director at the Royal Saxon Polytechnicum in Dresden (now Technische Universit√§t Dresden). Zeuner's efforts there led to the introduction of the humanities; the extension of the range of subjects taught resulted in the polytechnic's rise to a full-scale polytechnic university in 1890. In 1889, aged 61, Zeuner gave up his position as director of the polytechnic to work as a lecturer until his retirement in 1897. On retiring he was made an emeritus professor. Zeuner died in Dresden in 1907. Gustav Zeuner Award Since 1993, the German Association of Engineers (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure or VDI) has presented students with the Gustav Zeuner Award for the best engineering thesis in Germany; Zeuner supported the Dresden branch of the VDI at its foundation in 1897.

In some communes, the people also share common work, income or assets. In addition to the communal economy, consensus decision-making, non- hierarchical structures and ecological living have become important core principles for many communes. There are many contemporary intentional communities all over the world, a list of which can be found at the Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC).  Categorization of communities  Benjamin Zablocki categorized communities this way: * Alternative-family communities * Coliving communities * Cooperative communities * Countercultural communities * Egalitarian communities * Political communities * Psychological communities (based on mystical or gestalt principles) * Rehabilitational communities (see Synanon) * Religious communities * Spiritual communities * Experimental communities Many communal ventures encompass more than one of these categorizations. Some communes, such as the ashrams of the Vedanta Society or the Theosophical commune Lomaland, formed around spiritual leaders, while others formed around political ideologies. For others, the \\"glue\\" is simply the desire for a more shared, sociable lifestyle.  Core principles of communes  The central characteristics of communes, or core principles that define communes, have been expressed in various forms over the years. Before 1840 such communities were known as \\"communist and socialist settlements\\"; by 1860, they were also called \\"communitarian\\" and by around 1920 the term \\"intentional community\\" had been added to the vernacular of some theorists. The term \\"communitarian\\" was invented by the Suffolk-born radical John Goodwyn Barmby, subsequently a Unitarian minister. At the start of the 1970s, The New Communes author Ron E. Roberts classified communes as a subclass of a larger category of Utopias. He listed three main characteristics. Communes of this period tended to develop their own characteristics of theory though, so while many strived for variously expressed forms of egalitarianism, Roberts' list should never be read as typical. Roberts' three listed items were: first, egalitarianism ‚Äì that communes specifically rejected hierarchy or graduations of social status as being necessary to social order. Second, human scale ‚Äì that members of some communes saw the scale of society as it was then organized as being too industrialized (or factory sized) and therefore unsympathetic to human dimensions. And third, that communes were consciously anti-bureaucratic. Twenty five years later, Dr. Bill Metcalf, in his edited book Shared Visions, Shared Lives defined communes as having the following core principles: the importance of the group as opposed to the nuclear family unit, a \\"common purse\\", a collective household, group decision making in general and intimate affairs. Sharing everyday life and facilities, a commune is an idealized form of family, being a new sort of \\"primary group\\" (generally with fewer than 20 people although again there are outstanding examples of much larger communes or communes that experienced episodes with much larger populations). Commune members have emotional bonds to the whole group rather than to any sub-group, and the commune is experienced with emotions which go beyond just social collectivity.  Communes around the world  With the simple definition of a commune as an intentional community with 100% income sharing, the online directory of the Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC) lists 222 communes worldwide (28 January 2019). Some of these are religious institutions such as abbeys and monasteries. Others are based in anthroposophic philosophy, including Camphill villages that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with developmental disabilities, mental health problems or other special needs. Many communes are part of the New Age movement. Many cultures naturally practice communal or tribal living, and would not designate their way of life as a planned 'commune' per se, though their living situation may have many characteristics of a commune. =Germany= In Germany, a large number of the intentional communities define themselves as communes and there is a network of political communes called \\"Kommuja\\" with about 30 member groups (May 2009). Germany has a long tradition of intentional communities going back to the groups inspired by the principles of Lebensreform in the 19th century. Later, about 100 intentional communities were started in the Weimar Republic after World War I; many had a communal economy. In the 1960s, there was a resurgence of communities calling themselves communes, starting with the Kommune 1 in Berlin, followed by Kommune 2 (also Berlin) and Kommune 3 in Wolfsburg. In the German commune book, Das KommuneBuch, communes are defined by Elisabeth Vo√ü as communities which: * Live and work together, * Have a communal economy, i.e. common finances and common property (land, buildings, means of production), * Have communal decision making ‚Äì usually consensus decision making, * Try to reduce hierarchy and hierarchical structures, * Have communalization of housework, childcare and other communal tasks, * Have equality between women and men, * Have low ecological footprints through sharing and saving resources. =Israel= The communal dining hall in Kibbutz Merom Golan, ca. 1968‚Äì1972 Kibbutzim in Israel, (sing., kibbutz) are examples of officially organized communes, the first of which were based on agriculture. Today, there are dozens of urban communes growing in the cities of Israel, often called urban kibbutzim. The urban kibbutzim are smaller and more anarchist.Horrox, James. \\"A Living Revolution: Anarchism in the Kibbutz Movement\\", pp. 87‚Äì109 Most of the urban communes in Israel emphasize social change, education, and local involvement in the cities where they live. Some of the urban communes have members who are graduates of zionist-socialist youth movements, like HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed, HaMahanot HaOlim and Hashomer Hatsair.Horrox, James. \\"Rebuilding Israel's Utopia\\", Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture, October 2007 =Ireland= In 1831 John Vandeleur (a landlord) established a commune on his Ralahine Estate at Newmarket-on-Fergus, Co. Clare. Vandeleur asked Edward Thomas Craig, an English socialist, to formulate rules and regulations for the commune. It was set up with a population of 22 adult single men, 7 married women and their 7 husbands, 5 single women, 4 orphan boys and 5 children under the age of 9 years. No money was employed, only credit notes which could be used in the commune shop. All occupants were committed to a life with no alcohol, tobacco, snuff or gambling. All were required to work for 12 hours a day during the summer and from dawn to dusk in winter. The social experiment prospered for a time and 29 new members joined. However, in 1833 the experiment collapsed due to the gambling debts of John Vandeleur. The members of the commune met for the last time on 23 November 1833 and placed on record a declaration of \\"the contentment, peace and happiness they had experienced for two years under the arrangements introduced by Mr. Vandeleur and Mr. Craig and which through no fault of the Association was now at an end\\".

After the end of communism in Russia, monastic communities have again become more common, populous and, to a lesser degree, more influential in Russian society. Various patterns of Russian behavior ‚Äî (—Ç–æ–ª–æ–∫–∞), (–ø–æ–º–æ—á–∏), (–∞—Ä—Ç–µ–ª—å) ‚Äî are also based on communal (\\"–º–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏–µ\\") traditions. =United Kingdom= A 19th century advocate and practitioner of communal living was the utopian socialist John Goodwyn Barmby, who founded a Communist Church before becoming a Unitarian minister. The UK today has several communes or intentional communities, increasing since the New Towns Act 1946 to recuperate a lost sense of community at the centralization of population in Post-War New Towns such as Crawley or Corby. The Simon Community in London is an example of social cooperation, made to ease homelessness within London. It provides food and religion and is staffed by homeless people and volunteers. Mildly nomadic, they run street \\"caf√©s\\" which distribute food to their known members and to the general public. The wind turbines at Findhorn, which make the Ecovillage a net exporter of electricity. The Bruderhof has three locations in the UK and follows the example of the earliest Christians in the Book of Acts by living in community and sharing all things in common. In Glandwr, near Crymych, Pembrokeshire, a co-op called Lammas Ecovillage focuses on planning and sustainable development. Granted planning permission by the Welsh Government in 2009, it has since created 9 holdings and is a central communal hub for its community. In Scotland, the Findhorn Foundation founded by Peter and Eileen Caddy and Dorothy Maclean in 1962 is prominent for its educational centre and experimental architectural community project based at The Park, in Moray, Scotland, near the village of Findhorn.Local relations between the Findhorn Foundation and the village of Findhorn have occasionally foundered over inconsiderate use of the word 'Findhorn' to mean either the former or the Ecovillage. See for example Walker (1994), Talk:Findhorn Foundation and also Findhorn (disambiguation). The Findhorn Ecovillage community at The Park, Findhorn, a village in Moray, Scotland, and at Cluny Hill in Forres, now houses more than 400 people. =United States= There is a long history of communes in America (see this short discussion of Utopian communities) which led to the rise in the communes of the hippie movement‚Äîthe \\"back-to-the-land\\" ventures of the 1960s and 1970s. One commune that played a large role in the hippie movement was Kaliflower, a utopian living cooperative that existed in San Francisco between 1967 and 1973 built on values of free love and anti- capitalism. Andrew Jacobs of The New York Times wrote that \\"after decades of contraction, the American commune movement has been expanding since the mid-1990s, spurred by the growth of settlements that seek to marry the utopian-minded commune of the 1960s with the American predilection for privacy and capital appreciation.\\" (See Intentional community). The Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC) is the best source for listings of and more information about communes in the United States. While many American communes are short lived, some have been in operation for over 50 years. The Bruderhof was established in the US in 1954, Twin Oaks in 1967 and Koinonia Farm in 1942. Twin Oaks is a rare example of a non-religious commune surviving for longer than 30 years. =Venezuela= , the Venezuelan state has initiated the construction of almost 200 \\"socialist communes\\" which are billed as autonomous and independent from the government. The communes purportedly have their own \\"productive gardens\\" that grow their own vegetables as a method of self- supply. The communes also make independent decisions in regards to administration and the use of funding. The idea has been denounced as an attempt to undermine elected local governments, since the central government could shift its funding away from these in favor of communes, which are overseen by the federal Ministry of Communes and Social Protection.

A very broad coefficient and effective generation and development of ideas through a process that leads to new products. Thus, it is a major aspect of new product development. Due to the absence of a consensually accepted definition that reflects the breadth of the topic sufficiently, two discrete, yet interdependent, definitions are needed: one that explicitly defines product design in reference to the artifact, the other that defines the product design process in relation to this artifact. Product design as a noun: the set of properties of an artifact, consisting of the discrete properties of the form (i.e., the aesthetics of the tangible good or service) and the function (i.e. its capabilities) together with the holistic properties of the integrated form and function.Luchs, M., & Swan, K. S. (2011). Perspective: The Emergence of Product Design as a Field of Marketing Inquiry. Journal of Product Innovations Management, 28(3), 327-345. doi:10.1111/j.1540-5885.2011.00801.x Product design process: the set of strategic and tactical activities, from idea generation to commercialization, used to create a product design. In a systematic approach, product designers conceptualize and evaluate ideas, turning them into tangible inventions and products. The product designer's role is to combine art, science, and technology to create new products that people can use. Their evolving role has been facilitated by digital tools that now allow designers to do things that include communicate, visualize, analyze, 3D modeling and actually produce tangible ideas in a way that would have taken greater human resources in the past. Product design is sometimes confused with (and certainly overlaps with) industrial design, and has recently become a broad term inclusive of service, software, and physical product design. Industrial design is concerned with bringing artistic form and usability, usually associated with craft design and ergonomics, together in order to mass-produce goods. Other aspects of product design and industrial design include engineering design, particularly when matters of functionality or utility (e.g. problem-solving) are at issue, though such boundaries are not always clear.http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference- proceedings.aspx?Id=7824 Product design process There are various product design processes and many focus on different aspects. One example formulation/model of the process is described by Don Koberg and Jim Bagnellin in \\"The Seven Universal Stages of Creative Problem-Solving.\\" The process is usually completed by a group of people with different skills and training‚Äîe.g. industrial designers, field experts (prospective users), engineers (for engineering design aspects), depending upon the nature and type of the product involved. The process often involves figuring out what is required, brainstorming possible ideas, creating mock prototypes and then generating the product. However, that is not the end. Product designers would still need to execute the idea, making it into an actual product and evaluating its success (seeing if any improvements are necessary). The product design process has experienced huge leaps in evolution over the last few years with the rise and adoption of 3D printing. New consumer-friendly 3D printers can produce dimensional objects and print upwards with a plastic like substance opposed to traditional printers that spread ink across a page. The product design process, as expressed by Koberg and Bagnell, typically involves three main aspects: *Analysis *Concept *Synthesis Depending on the kind of product being designed, the latter two sections are most often revisited (e.g. depending on how often the design needs revision, to improve it or to better fit the criteria). This is a continuous loop, where feedback is the main component. Koberg and Bagnell offer more specifics on the process: In their model, \\"analysis\\" consists of two stages, \\"concept\\" is only one stage, and \\"synthesis\\" encompasses the other four. (These terms notably vary in usage in different design frameworks. Here, they are used in the way they're used by Koberg and Bagnell.) =Analysis= *Accept Situation: Here, the designers decide on committing to the project and finding a solution to the problem. They pool their resources into figuring out how to solve the task most efficiently. *Analyze: In this stage, everyone in the team begins research. They gather general and specific materials which will help to figure out how their problem might be solved. This can range from statistics, questionnaires, and articles, among many other sources. =Concept= *Define: This is where the key issue of the matter is defined. The conditions of the problem become objectives, and restraints on the situation become the parameters within which the new design must be constructed. =Synthesis= *Ideate: The designers here brainstorm different ideas, solutions for their design problem. The ideal brainstorming session does not involve any bias or judgment, but instead builds on original ideas. *Select: By now, the designers have narrowed down their ideas to a select few, which can be guaranteed successes and from there they can outline their plan to make the product. *Implement: This is where the prototypes are built, the plan outlined in the previous step is realized and the product starts to become an actual object. *Evaluate: In the last stage, the product is tested, and from there, improvements are made. Although this is the last stage, it does not mean that the process is over. The finished prototype may not work as well as hoped so new ideas need to be brainstormed. Demand-pull innovation and invention-push innovation Most product designs fall under one of two categories: demand-pull innovation or invention-push innovation.Archer, B. (1974). Design awareness and planned creativity in industry. (p. 87). Toronto: Thorn Press Limited. Demand-pull happens when there is an opportunity in the market to be explored by the design of a product. This product design attempts to solve a design problem. The design solution may be the development of a new product or developing a product that's already on the market, such as developing an existing invention for another purpose. Invention-push innovation happens when there is an advancement in intelligence. This can occur through research or it can occur when the product designer comes up with a new product design idea. Product design expression pellets. Design expression comes from the combined effect of all elements in a product. Colour tone, shape and size should direct a person's thoughts towards buying the product.Hekkert, P., & Schifferstein, H. (2008). Product experience. (1 ed., p. 335). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science. Therefore, it is in the product designer's best interest to consider the audiences who are most likely to be the product's end consumers. Keeping in mind how consumers will perceive the product during the design process will direct towards the product‚Äôs success in the market.Hekkert, P., & Schifferstein, H. (2008). Product experience . (1 ed., pp. 334). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science However, even within a specific audience, it is challenging to cater to each possible personality within that group. One solution to that is to create a product that, in its designed appearance and function, expresses a personality or tells a story. Products that carry such attributes are more likely to give off a stronger expression that will attract more consumers. On that note it is important to keep in mind that design expression does not only concern the appearance of a product, but also its function. For example, as humans our appearance as well as our actions are subject to people's judgment when they are making a first impression of us. People usually do not appreciate a rude person even if they are good looking. Similarly, a product can have an attractive appearance but if its function does not follow through it will most likely drop in regards to consumer interest. In this sense, designers are like communicators, they use the language of different elements in the product to express something.Hekkert, P., & Schifferstein, H. (2008). Product experience. (1 ed., pp. 349). Amsterdam: Elsevier Science. Trends in product design Product designers need to consider all of the details: the ways people use and abuse objects, faulty products, errors made in the design process, and the desirable ways in which people wish they could use objects.Norman, D. (2002). The design of everyday things. (p. 29). New York: Basic Books. Many new designs will fail and many won't even make it to market. Some designs eventually become obsolete. The design process itself can be quite frustrating usually taking 5 or 6 tries to get the product design right. A product that fails in the marketplace the first time may be re-introduced to the market 2 more times. If it continues to fail, the product is then considered to be dead because the market believes it to be a failure. Most new products fail, even if there's a great idea behind them. All types of product design are clearly linked to the economic health of manufacturing sectors. Innovation provides much of the competitive impetus for the development of new products, with new technology often requiring a new design interpretation. It only takes one manufacturer to create a new product paradigm to force the rest of the industry to catch up‚Äîfueling further innovation. Products designed to benefit people of all ages and abilities‚Äîwithout penalty to any group‚Äîaccommodate our swelling aging population by extending independence and supporting the changing physical and sensory needs we all encounter as we grow older.

To prevent this, some groups claim that they sequester staff months before an election.Rothenberg Political Report, 8/2/10 http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/news/article/dccc-turns-to-mooks-ground- game-for-fall An organization making an independent expenditure must include a federally mandated disclaimer identifying the person or organization paying for the communication and stating that the communication was not authorized by a candidate or candidate's committee.FEC Website, Coordinated Communications and Independent Expenditures Brochure http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/indexp.shtml#IE As Distinguished From Contributions Contributions are money, or their equivalent, that are given to someone to use. Candidates and groups then spend the money, or their equivalent, to pay for campaigns. The phrase \\"or their equivalent\\" is incorporated into definitions to account for other things of value. For example, a radio station that gives free air-time so a group can run an ad is making a contribution. Coordinations = Pre-Candidacy Strategies = In recent years, a number of candidates have sought to bypass campaign finance rules by delaying their intention to run for office, instead forming so-called \\"exploratory committees.\\" Exploratory committees had been in existence well before the advent of super PACs, but are now increasingly used with the explicit intention of giving candidates a head-start in their respective campaigns. Ostensibly, they're created as a means to \\"test the waters\\" of that potential candidate's electability; in reality, and today more than ever, it enables them to raise money above what is set out in the federal candidate contribution limits and restrictions (which stipulates no more than $2,700 per individual donor, and no corporate/union funds) until they've officially declared their candidacy. This behavior has been challenged by legal analysts, most notably by the Senior Counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, Paul S. Ryan. He asserts that prior to the 2016 Presidential Primaries, \\"[Jeb] Bush, [Martin] O'Malley, [Rick] Santorum and [Scott] Walker [were] all raising funds above the $2,700 candidate limit, providing reason to believe they [were] violating federal law.\\" Ryan argues, \\"[They] have actually crossed the threshold to become 'candidates' as defined in federal law, by referring to themselves publicly as candidates and/or by amassing campaign funds that will be spent after they formally declare their candidacies.\\" Furthermore, by refraining from officially announcing their candidacies, they are essentially free to raise unlimited funds for their chosen super PAC, and both 'coordinate' with and guide that super PAC in any way they see fit. This allows potential candidates-to-be to drum-up support and publicity, as well as stockpiling funds for their nominated super PAC, well in advance of whichever campaign they're looking to contest. = Examples of Alleged Coordination = Some have argued that FEC regulations are regularly flouted through the use of loopholes, and that a significant amount of independent expenditure is, in reality, coordinated. A piece written by Alex Roarty and Shane Goldmacher in the National Journal, and republished in The Atlantic, outlined just how \\"brazen\\" current attempts at coordination can be. Focusing on Thom Tillis, a Republican US Senator from North Carolina, and his 2014 Senate campaign's efforts to influence his allied super PAC, it details the publication of a freely-available memo on Tillis's website, which outlined his campaign's detailed advertising strategy. Purportedly 'intended' for donors, \\"It is just as easily read as an explicit wish list aimed at the inboxes of outside allies with whom he cannot otherwise legally communicate about strategy.\\" Paul S. Ryan from the Campaign Legal Center noted he had \\"never seen anything like it,\\" but \\"hastened to add he also saw nothing illegal in the Tillis missive.\\" As Roarty and Goldmacher elaborate, \\"The restrictions that bar coordination between candidates and their allies only apply to explicit communication between the two sides‚Äîa loophole that has been exploited by speaking in public ever since the proliferation of outside organizations following the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling.\\" In 2015, Jeb Bush and his dealings with his Right to Rise super PAC faced significant scrutiny due to the perception of apparent coordination. Alice Ollstein, writing for thinkprogress.org, clarifies, \\"Buried in the most recent round of FEC filings is evidence Bush's Right to Rise super PAC paid the firm Wisecup Consulting LLC at least $16,000 this April and May for 'political strategy consulting,' while the campaign paid the same firm about $60,000 for exactly the same service ‚Äî despite the two entities being legally barred from any coordination.\\" Moreover, after suffering setbacks in the early primaries of his presidential campaign, Jeb Bush's Right to Rise super PAC produced a television advert using his brother, former President George W. Bush, to endorse him. When queried about the commercial, Jeb Bush protested that \\"[He] didn't know [his brother] was doing that\\" and was \\"righteous in making sure there's no coordination.\\" Given the nature of their relationship, some have found it difficult to believe that Jeb Bush had no role or influence in recruiting his brother to make the ad, and thus, contravened campaign finance coordination rules. Some have advocated for a rethink in campaign finance law, given the relative impunity with which candidates now act and disregard campaign finance rules. Attorney Ben W. Heineman Jr. wrote in The Atlantic that \\"making damning facts public will be necessary to present a case\\" that \\"unmasks the claim\\" of super PACS being independent of their chosen candidates. However, for the time being, it seems as though tackling coordination in any meaningful way is unlikely. Even the Chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, Ann M. Ravel, admitted, \\"The likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim. ‚Ä¶ I never want to give up, but I'm not under any illusions. People think the F.E.C. is dysfunctional. It's worse than dysfunctional.\\" =Important Supreme Court Decisions= In 1976, the United States Supreme Court ruled on Buckley v. Valeo, a case which challenged most of the provisions in the Federal Election Campaign Act. The court upheld the law's limits on contributions to candidates for Federal office. The Court did not, however, uphold limits on expenditures made by candidates or on independent expenditures. Middle Tennessee State University First Amendment Encyclopedia https://www.mtsu.edu/first- amendment/article/126/buckley-v-valeoCenter for Responsive Politics Glossary of Terms http://www.opensecrets.org/glossary.php?id=4 In 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held in Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission that political action committees (PACs) and other groups that made independent expenditures, but not contributions to candidate committees or parties, could accept contributions without restriction as to source or size.

It measures in area, it is located at Lat.: N23 42' 30\\" - Long.: W 74 50' 00\\". It has many rolling hills that rise to about 120 feet (37 m). The island is believed to have acquired its modern name from a shipwrecked cargo of rum. The main settlement is Port Nelson. Its population was recorded as 99 RUM CAY POPULATION BY SETTLEMENT AND TOTAL NUMBER OF OCCUPIED DWELLINGS: 2010 CENSUS - Bahamas Department of Statistics and as 30 . Before 1996 the island was part of a combined district of San Salvador and Rum Cay. The population of Rum Cay as of 2015 is 53. Location Rum Cay is 20 miles (32 km) southwest of San Salvador Island. History =Aboriginals= Rum Cay was called Mamana by the native Lucayans. In the north there is a cave containing Lucayan drawings and carvings. Various artifacts from the Arawak period have been found by farmers in the fertile soil, which the natives enriched with bat guano. =Spanish= Some writers, such as Samuel Eliot Morison, identified Rum Cay as the site of one of Christopher Columbus' landfalls during his 1492 voyage, as the island Columbus called Santa Mar√≠a. However, a variety of other historians, geographers, and other writers identify the island as corresponding to different islands in the Bahamas or Caicos.Wilcomb E. Washburn, \\"Landfall Controversy\\" in The Christopher Columbus Encyclopedia, Vol. 1 (ed. Silvio A. Bedin: Simon & Schuster, 1992). =Loyalists= Plantation boundaries known as ‚Äòmargins‚Äô can be seen all over the island, which date from the beginning of the 19th century when Loyalists settled here. In common with other islands, Rum Cay has gone through a series of industry specific economic peaks. Pineapple, salt and sisal have all been important industries, but competition and natural disasters, such as the 1926 hurricane, have all taken their toll. Settlements such as Port Boyd, Black Rock and Gin Hill are now deserted and overgrown. =Today= Tourism has traditionally been the main source of employment. Nearly everybody lives in Port Nelson where cottages can be rented. Places of interest Deep reefs and drop-offs surround this former pirates‚Äô haven. There is staghorn coral at Summer Point Reef and diving at Pinder‚Äôs Point. At the Grand Canyon, 60-foot coral walls almost reach the surface. Sumner Point Marina has dockage, fuel, moorings, WiFi, bar and restaurant. As of summer 2013, this marina is closed, and has only dockage available but absolutely no services. = HMS Conqueror = The wreck of the 101-gun man of war HMS Conqueror, built in Devon in 1855 and which served in the Crimean War, lies in 30 feet of water off Rum Cay. She was lost on Sumner Point Reef, Rum Cay, on December 13, 1861. All 1,400 aboard survived. The wreck is preserved as the Underwater Museum of the Bahamas. It is the property of The Bahamas Government and none of the contents of the ship may be removed. :\\"She was 20 nm out in estimating her position and, after making her landfall, cut rounding the southeast point of Rum Cay too fine and went hard on the reef. Her captain, fearing that his crew (most of whom could not swim in those days) would drink themselves insensible when it became obvious the ship was lost, ordered all ale, wine, and spirit casks to be broken and their contents ditched. He then sent the two largest ship‚Äôs company unloaded everything they could salvage, and set about making a camp on the island. The captain remained on board with one midshipman and ten seamen until the ship broke up. Then all of them, less the boat parties, were marooned on Rum Cay. They were rescued soon after the news of the disaster was known.\\" Transportation The island is served by Port Nelson Airport.

The Council had seven members, said by the British and Irish governments to have included Gerry Adams, the former president of Sinn F√©in. The Independent Monitoring Commission declared in 2008 that the council was \\"no longer operational or functional,\\"RT√â 3 September 2008, \\"IRA Army Council no longer operational\\". but also states that the Army Council still exists and has not dissolved.The Guardian, 3 September 2008, \\"Provisionals' ruling body, the army council, has not dissolved\\" Background = Origins = The Army Council of the IRA split in December 1969 and a \\"Provisional\\" Army Council emerged as the head of the newly formed Provisional Irish Republican Army. = Legal status = The IRA was a proscribed organization under the terms of the Offences Against the State Acts passed between 1939 and 1998 in the Republic of Ireland and under equivalent anti-terrorist legislation in the United Kingdom, making membership of it a criminal offence. In the Republic, trials for membership take place in the Special Criminal Court (where three judges hear cases without a jury, on the evidence of a Garda superintendent or higher rank) and carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment. =Relationship with Sinn F√©in= Senior members of Sinn F√©in, some of whom, according to both the British and Irish governments, have sat on the Army Council, together with IRA members not known to be involved in illegal activities, have been effectively immune from prosecution in recent years in order to enable progress in the peace process. On 14 January 2005, Martin Ferris, a Sinn F√©in TD for North Kerry, was accused of being a member of the IRA Army Council in an article in The Irish Times written by journalist Kevin Myers. In the same article, Myers also accused members of Sinn F√©in who had visited Downing Street in December 2004, a delegation that had included Gerry Adams, of sitting on the Army Council. On 20 February 2005, Irish Justice Minister Michael McDowell publicly named Ferris, Gerry Adams, and Martin McGuinness, Sinn F√©in's chief negotiator, as members of the Army Council during a radio interview. The three men issued a statement the next day denying the charge. On 27 July 2005, McDowell expressed his belief that Adams, McGuinness, and Ferris had recently (within the previous few days) left the IRA Army Council. However he also claimed that it was his opinion that this by itself did not necessarily amount to a permanent split between the two organisations. On 20 October 2015, the Assessment on Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland, commissioned by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the structure, role and purpose of paramilitary organisations reported the structures of the IRA remain in existence \\"in a much reduced form\\", including \\"a senior leadership, the 'Provisional Army Council' and some 'departments'\\", but that they are not recruiting members. It concluded that the IRA still has access to some weapons, but have not sought to procure more since at least 2011. It also said that IRA members believe the Army Council oversees both the IRA and Sinn F√©in.https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/469548/Paramilitary_Groups_in_Northern_Ireland_-_20_Oct_2015.pdf Membership In May 2005, The Sunday Times reported that the following changes were made to the IRA Army Council: *Bernard Fox replaced Brian Keenan *Brian Arthurs and Sean Murray were named as possible replacements for Gerry Adams *Martin Lynch replaced Martin McGuinness *Martin Ferris was also reported to have stepped down The Sunday Times reported in July 2005 that security sources believed that the current Army Council consisted of: *Thomas Murphy, chief of staff *Brian Arthurs, Commander, Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade *Bernard Fox, a former hunger striker (on 24 September 2006, The Sunday Times reported that Fox had resigned from the Army Council) *Sean Murray, from Belfast, OC of Northern Command *Martin Lynch, Adjutant-general, an Adams supporter from Belfast *Brian Gillen, from Belfast *A Dublin man who was not named for legal reasons See also * Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army, listing Chiefs of Staff from 1917 * Continuity Army Council * Irish republican legitimism References Sources *A Secret History of the IRA, Ed Moloney, 2002. *\\"Irish minister says Adams is an IRA leader\\" by Angelique Chrisafis, The Guardian, 21 February 2005 *\\"We are not IRA members, Sinn F√©in leaders insist\\" by Angelique Chrisafis, The Guardian, 22 February 2005 *http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0903/northpolitics.html \\"IRA Army Council no longer operational\\" RT√â 3 September 2008\\" Provisional Irish Republican Army ","title":"IRA Army Council"},{"id":"999564","text":"Money Pit is a British television series first broadcast on Dave in 2015.

Background Money Pit is broadcast on Dave, presented by comedian Jason Manford and financial pundit Dominic Frisby, and narrated by Elizabeth Carling. The eight-part series explores the idea of crowdfunding, putting prospective investors in contact with those with business ideas. Crow TV was in charge of audio and video post, with production by Liberty Bell Productions, who have previously produced Dave Gorman: Modern Life is Goodish for Dave. It was commissioned by Richard Watsham and Iain Coyle, with Liberty Bell's Charlie Anderson directing the series, Jamie Isaacs and Michele Carlisle executive producing the show. Filming took place at Alexandra Palace. The music for the series was composed by Kevin Kerrigan. In an interview with Broadcast, series producer Pat Doyle described the show as a \\"legal minefield\\" due to crowdfunding being heavily regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and as such the show had to remain on middle ground. Format Sixty prospective investors sit in the audience, with five contenders per episode. Each backer has submitted an amount of money into an escrow account, a communal pot. Each contender is given a couple of minutes to talk, after which a klaxon sounds and the investors are given time to fire questions at the contender, during which they reveal the sought amount followed by the incentive offered; this can be in the form of a percentage of the business, or in the form of rewards, such as \\"for ¬£500 I offer a tour of the facility\\". After a while, trading time begins and each investor may submit investment to any contender that has pitched so far, possibly at the expense of investment submitted to other contenders.

Many botanists treat it as a variety of bald cypress, Taxodium distichum (as T. distichum var. imbricatum) rather than as a distinct species, but it differs in ecology, occurring mainly in still blackwater rivers, ponds and swamps without silt-rich flood deposits. It predominates in cypress dome habitats. Description Taxodium ascendens reaches on average in height. Compared to T. distichum, the leaves are shorter (3‚Äì10 mm long), slenderer and are on shoots that tend to be erect rather than spreading. The trunk is expanded at the base, even on young trees, assisting the tree in anchoring in the soft, muddy soil. The cones also tend to be smaller, not over 2.5 cm diameter. The bark is also a paler gray color. Like Bald Cypresses, Pond Cypresses growing in water have a characteristic growth trait called cypress knees; these are woody projections pneumatophores sent above the water from the roots. The function of these cypress knees is not known. Maximum longevity of this plant is estimated at 1000 years. This figure may be an underestimate, as The Senator, until recently growing in Longwood, Florida's Big Tree Park, was estimated to be over 3,400 years old. Distribution This species is native to the southeastern United States, from southeastern Virginia to southeastern Louisiana and south into Florida except for the Florida Keys. Stunted individuals of pond cypress are notable in the dwarf cypress savanna of the Everglades National Park. Habitat black water, Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, USA Taxodium ascendens occurs naturally in shallow ponds, lake margins, swamps and wetlands.

Ahuehuete is derived from the Nahuatl name for the tree, ƒÅhuƒìhuƒìtl, which means \\"upright drum in water\\" or \\"old man of the water.\\" Description It is a large evergreen or semi-evergreen tree growing to tall and with a trunk of diameter (occasionally much more; see below). The leaves are spirally arranged but twisted at the base to lie in two horizontal ranks, long and broad. The cones are ovoid, long and broad. Unlike bald cypress and pond cypress, Montezuma cypress rarely produces cypress knees from the roots. Trees from the Mexican highlands achieve a notable stoutness. One specimen, the √Årbol del Tule in Santa Mar√≠a del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico, is the stoutest tree in the world with a diameter of . Several other specimens from diameter are known. The second stoutest tree in the world is the Big Baobab, an African Baobab. Habitat and range Montezuma Bald Cypress (Taxodium mucronatum), growing on the Rio Pil√≥n near Villagr√°n, Municipality of Villagr√°n, Tamaulipas, Mexico (9 August 2005) Montezuma cypress is primarily a riparian tree, growing along upland riversides, but can also be found next to springs and marshes. It occurs from , in Mexico mainly in highlands at in altitude. T. mucronatum is very drought-tolerant and fast-growing and favors climates that are rainy throughout the year or at least with high summer rainfall. Taxodium mucronatum is native to much of Mexico as far south as the highlands of southern Mexico. Two disjunct populations exist in the United States. One is in the Rio Grande Valley of southernmost Texas, while the other is in southern New Mexico, near Las Cruces. Within Guatemala, the tree is restricted to Huehuetenango Department. Culture \\"El √Årbol del Tule\\", in Santa Mar√≠a del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico The sabino became the national tree of Mexico in 1910. The tree is sacred to the native peoples of Mexico, and is featured in the Zapotec creation myth. To the Aztecs, the combined shade of an ƒÅhuƒìhuƒìtl and a p≈çch≈çtl (Ceiba pentandra) metaphorically represented a ruler's authority. According to legend, Hern√°n Cort√©s wept under an ahuehuete in Popotla after suffering defeat during the Battle of La Noche Triste. This plant is mentioned in the 2015 short story \\"Rivers\\" by John Keene, which reimagines the story of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Uses Montezuma cypresses have been used as ornamental trees since Pre-Columbian times. The Aztecs planted ƒÅhuƒìhuƒìtl along processional paths in the gardens of Chapultepec because of its association with government. Artificial islands called chinampas were formed in the shallow lakes of the Valley of Mexico by adding soil to rectangular areas enclosed by trees such as ƒÅhuƒìhuƒìtl; they also lined the region's canals prior to Spanish conquest. Ahuehuetes are frequently cultivated in Mexican parks and gardens. The wood is used to make house beams and furniture. The Aztecs used its resin to treat gout, ulcers, skin diseases, wounds, and toothaches. A decoction made from the bark was used as a diuretic and an emmenagogue. Pitch derived from the wood was used as a cure for bronchitis The leaves acted as a relaxant and could help reduce itching. John Naka, a world-renowned bonsai master, donated his very first bonsai, a Montezuma Cypress, to the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum of the United States.

Slick's father, Thomas Baker Slick Sr., a.k.a. \\"The King of the Wildcatters\\", had made a fortune during the Oklahoma oil boom of the 1910s. He was notable for discovering Oklahoma's then-largest oil field, the Cushing Oil Field. Career During the 1950s, Slick was an adventurer. He turned his attention to expeditions to investigate the Loch Ness Monster, the Yeti, Bigfoot and the Trinity Alps giant salamander. Slick's interest in cryptozoology was little known until the 1989 publication of the biography Tom Slick and the Search for Yeti, by Loren Coleman. Coleman continued his study of Slick in 2002 with Tom Slick: True Life Encounters in Cryptozoology. That book mentions many of Slick's adventures, in politics, art, science, and cryptozoology, including his involvement with the CIA and Howard Hughes. Slick was a friend of many celebrities, including Hughes and fellow flier Jimmy Stewart. Stewart, for example, assisted a Slick-backed expedition in smuggling a piece of the Pangboche Yeti hand back to England for scientific analysis, Loren Coleman was to discover from Slick's files and confirmation from Stewart before his death. Slick founded several research organizations, beginning with the forerunner of the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in 1941. His most well-known legacy is the non-profit Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), which he founded in 1947 to seek revolutionary advancements in technology. SwRI continues to advance pure and applied science in a variety of fields from lubricant and motor fuel formulation to solar physics and planetary science. He also founded the Mind Science Foundation in San Antonio in 1958 to do consciousness research. In 1955 he was awarded a patent for the lift slab method of constructing concrete buildings. He was an advocate of world peace. In 1958 he published the book, Permanent Peace: A Check and Balance Plan. He funded the Tom Slick World Peace lectures at the LBJ Library, and the Tom Slick Professorship of World Peace at the University of Texas.

The crocodile exoskeleton consists of the protective dermal and epidermal components of the integumentary system in animals of the order Crocodilia. It is a form of armour. Structure and anatomy The epidermal exoskeleton of the alligator consists of oblong horny scales, arranged in transverse rows; the long axes of the scales are parallel to that of the body. On the tail, except along the mid-dorsal line, and on the ventral side of the trunk and head these scales are very regular in outline and arrangement; on the sides of the head and trunk and on the legs they are much smaller and less regularly arranged, while along the mid-dorsal line of the tail, especially in its posterior half, they are elevated into tall keels that give the tail a large surface area for swimming. The first three digits of both manus (fore foot) and pes (hind foot) are armed with horny claws, which also belong to the epidermal part of the exoskeleton. The dermal exoskeleton consists of bony scutes that underlie the epidermal scales of the dorsal surface of the trunk and anterior part of the tail. The overlying scales, except in very young animals, are always rubbed off, so that the bony scales are exposed. The ventral or inner surface of the scutes is flat, while the outer surface is strongly keeled and in old animals is often rough and pitted. The plates are nearly square in outline and are closely joined together in most places. The scutes are grouped in two fairly distinct areas known as the nuchal and the dorsal shields. The former lies just back of the head, in the region of the fore legs, and consists of four larger and a number of smaller plates. The latter, or dorsal shield, extends over the back in fairly regular longitudinal rows and quite regular transverse rows. At the widest part of the trunk there are six or eight of these scutes in one transverse row. They become smaller towards the tail. The teeth are exoskeletal structures, partly of ectodermal, partly of dermal origin. They are conical in shape, without roots, and are replaced when lost. They will be described in connection with the skull. Musk glands, said by GadowGadow 1923. to be present in all Crocodilia, are found in both sexes and are derivations of the skin. One pair, each of which may be as large as a walnut, is found on the lower side of the head, one on the inside of each half of the mandible. The other pair is inside of the lips of the cloaca. Histology of the integument The epidermis of an embryo, young, or half-grown Crocodilia contains the rete Malpighii: a single layer of short, cylindrical cells. Over the rete are somewhat flattened, disk-shaped cells formed by transverse division of the underlying rete cells. On the outside lies the epitrichial layer, a mosaic of polygonal cells each with an oval nucleus near its middle. Between the epitrichial cells are small oval holes, not unlike the stomata in the epidermis of plant tissues. BronnBronn 1859. thinks these are not artifacts, but he does not suggest any explanation of their occurrence. On the short, cylindrical rete Malpighii cells are flattened cells that gradually become very flat and lose their nuclei as they pass over into the horny layer. The stratum corneum consists of strongly flattened cells in which the nuclei can no longer be clearly seen, though their location can usually be determined by the groups of pigment granules. On the cells of the more superficial layers of the stratum corneum are straight, dark lines, perhaps ridges caused by pressure of the over- or underlying polygonal cells. The individual cells of the horny layer are usually easily isolated in the belly and neck regions where they never become very thick; but in the back the cells in this layer are very numerous and fuse with each other to form the bony plates; here the rete is the only clearly differentiated layer. Whether prickle cells are present in the epidermis of the crocodile Bronn is not certain, though he thinks they probably are. RathkeRathke 1866. pointed out that on the surface of certain folds of the integument, especially in the region of the jaws, are found in all Crocodilia certain small, scattered, wart-like elevations, around each of which is customarily a narrow, shallow, circular groove; they usually have a dark brown but sometimes a gray or even white color. Microscopic examination shows these warts to be of epidermal origin, consisting of bright, round cells that are closely united, without visible intercellular substance. Treatment with potassium hydroxide and then with water will show sometimes, though not always, fine granular nuclei in the cells. In probably all members of the genus Crocodilus, at least is found, on the thick swelling on the right and on the left side of the neck and trunk, a small, flat pit which has the appearance of the opening of an integumental gland. The pits are present also in the scales of the throat, under the side of the neck, sides of the body, lateral and ventral surfaces of the anterior half of the tail, and the legs. They are near the hinder border of the scales. Only occasionally are two pits found in one scale. These pits are found in the gavials but are absent in some, probably all, alligators. A small knob projects from the center of some of the pits. These pits are not openings of glands but have about the same structure as the pits seen in the head. The integumental bones in the Crocodilia originate in the connective tissue of the cutis. Investigations in young animals show that these bones usually take their origin in the under and middle layers of the cutis and generally work towards the periphery. Footnotes Sources * Bronn, H. G.

Owned by Stingray Group, it broadcasts an urban contemporary format, and was Canada's first station to adopt the format upon its launch in 2001. CFXJ's studios are located at Yonge and St. Clair in Toronto's Deer Park neighbourhood, while its transmitter is located at the top of First Canadian Place in Toronto's Financial District. History =Launch= Milestone Radio, a company incorporated by Denham Jolly, first applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for an urban music station in 1989, but were passed over in favour of a country music station, CISS.CRTC Decision 90-993 Twelve applicants dance for last local FM radio spot, Greg Quill, Toronto Star, November 23, 1989 They applied again in 1997, and were passed over in favour of CBLA, the city's existing Radio One station, which the CBC wanted to move to FM for technical reasons. CRTC Decision 97-362 CBC vs. 'dance' - who'll win 99.1 FM?, Peter Goddard, Toronto Star, April 12, 1997 Both decisions sparked controversy in Toronto, as the CRTC's reasons for passing over an urban-format station (which Toronto did not have) in favour of existing radio services were believed to be racist in nature. The lack of an urban station also created immense difficulties for Canadian hip hop, reggae and R&B; musicians, who had no radio outlets in Canada to play and promote their music. Wrong headed CRTC fails Black community Royson James, Toronto Star, August 30, 1997 How the CRTC sold out Toronto decision to reject 'urban' format for 99.1 was power play, pure and simple, Peter Goddard, Toronto Star, August 2, 1997 Seems Blacks denied FM voice for reasons other than ability, Toronto Star, September 19, 1997 Canadian radio fails young urban musicians, Toronto Star, September 30, 1997 The original logo of Flow 93.5 (2001‚Äì2007) As well, the 99.1 signal which was awarded to the CBC was believed to be the last available FM frequency in the city. However, in 1998, the CBC found that it was able to surrender two repeater transmitters outside of Toronto due to CBLA's superior coverage of the region. CBC offers plan for new FM station; hopes to calm outrage at taking last spot, Tim Harper, Toronto Star, October 1, 1997 Cabinet eyes a radio deal for black station and CBC, Tim Harper, Toronto Star, October 18, 1997 In 2000, the CRTC opened applications for new services on these two frequencies, and on Milestone's third application, the CRTC awarded the 93.5 frequency to the company on June 16 of that year.Decision CRTC 2000-203 CFXJ signed on the air on February 9, 2001, at 9:35 p.m., under the name Flow 93.5, with \\"Roots, Rock, Reggae\\" by Bob Marley being the first song played.

Since CFXJ's debut, many Canadian hip hop and R&B; musicians, including Jully Black, k-os, Kardinal Offishall and Jarvis Church, among others, have made the types of significant career breakthroughs that often eluded Canadian urban musicians in the 1990s. =Rhythmic top 40 era (2007‚Äì2014)= Logo used as \\"The New Flow 93.5\\" until 2011 In 2005, the station began to shift towards a more rhythmic direction. In 2007, the station re-branded as The New Flow 93.5, completing its shift to a rhythmic contemporary format. By 2009, with Rogers' launch of KiSS 92.5, CFXJ shifted back towards an urban direction. However, this proved unsuccessful, and many of the adult urban tracks were dropped by March 2010. On June 23, 2010, it was announced that CTVglobemedia's CHUM Radio would acquire the station, subject to CRTC approval; the transaction was approved on December 23.Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2010-715 Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2010-964 CHUM previously joint ventured with Milestone with CHBN-FM in Edmonton, which was sold to Rogers Radio along with CHST-FM in London. The station's headquarters were relocated from their longtime home at 211 Yonge Street to CTV's 250 Richmond Street West (near 299 Queen Street West, where MuchMusic and other CTV specialty television stations are based). In February 2011, the sale to CTVglobemedia (which was acquired by shareholder Bell Canada and renamed Bell Media several months later) was completed. Upon the closure of the sale, nearly the entirety of its staff was laid off, all specialty programming was cancelled, and the station shifted back to a rhythmic contemporary format. CHUM's vice president of programming, David Corey, replaced Wayne Williams as PD and reshuffled the lineup, bringing in fellow ex-WJMN/Boston imaging director Scott Morello as APD, and re-teaming morning host Melanie Martin with her fellow CKIS alumni J.J. King. Midday personality Miss Ange, afternoon drive personality Jeni, swing personality (now evenings) Peter Kash, MD Justin Dumont, promotions coordinator Angelique Knights, morning show producer Johnny Michaels, creative writer John Shannon, and producer Korey Bray, along with former sales manager Byron Garby and some other account representatives, were all retained. With the launch of urban AC competitor CKFG-FM, the station moved back to an urban direction once more. However, by December 2012, the station had moved back to a rhythmic CHR format. right In March 2013, the Competition Bureau approved a proposal by Bell Media to acquire Astral Media, under the condition that it divest itself of several television services and radio stations. Following the closure of the merger in July 2013, CFXJ was placed in a blind trust pending its eventual sale. CFXJ, along with four other Astral Media radio stations, was sold to Newcap Radio for $112 million. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 19, 2014, and the sale closed on March 31, 2014.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2014-129 With the sale, CFXJ moved their studios to the former CFRB and CKFM studios at 2 St. Clair West (at Yonge and St. Clair). =Classic hip hop era (2014-2016)= left In late 2014, influenced by the popularity of The Back in the Day Buffet noon-hour mix-show, as well as the growing popularity of the classic hip-hop format in the United States, the station revamped its playlist to include classic hip-hop, R&B; and reggae tracks from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, while still playing some currents. In addition, CFXJ added a secondary slogan: \\"The Best Throwbacks and Hottest Hits.\\" By March 2015, the station's primary slogan was altered to \\"All The Best Throwbacks\\". = The Move, return to Flow (2016-present)= Logo as \\"The Move\\" (2016-2019) On February 25, 2016, CFXJ went jockless and began promoting a \\"big move\\" to take place at 8 a.m. the following Monday (February 29). At that time, the station flipped to rhythmic adult contemporary as 93.5 The Move, with a focus on rhythmic and hip-hop hits from the late 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. CFXJ joined CKBE/Montreal as the only English-language rhythmic AC outlets in Canada. As part of the rebrand, the station also axed numerous on air hosts, including Melanie Martin of the JJ & Melanie morning show, midday host Miss Ange, and evening host Megan Coady. Weekend host J'ness moved to sister station CIHT-FM in Ottawa prior to the rebrand. On November 6, 2017, CFXJ switched back to a rhythmic contemporary format once again, while maintaining the Move branding and a small amount of rhythmic recurrents. Newcap Radio was acquired by Stingray Group in October 2018. On February 11, 2019, CFXJ reverted to the Flow 93.5 branding and switched to an urban contemporary format.

When aged 18, Christie was arrested while carrying explosives to assassinate the Spanish caudillo, General Francisco Franco. He was later alleged to be a member of the Angry Brigade, but was acquitted of related charges. He went on to found the Cienfuegos Press publishing house, as well as radical publications The Free-Winged Eagle and The Hastings Trawler, and in 2006 the online Anarchist Film Channel, which hosts films and documentaries with anarchist and libertarian socialist themes. His memoir Granny Made Me an Anarchist was published in 2004. Biography =Early life= Christie was born in the Partick area of Glasgow and raised in Blantyre by his mother and grandparents, becoming an anarchist at a young age. He ascribed this to his grandmother's influence, \\"Basically, what she did was provide a moral barometer which married almost exactly with that of libertarian socialism and anarchism, and she provided the star which I followed.\\" He joined the Anarchist Federation in Glasgow in 1962, at the age of 16. He became active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, attracted to the more militant approach of the Direct Action Committee and Committee of 100, and took part in the confrontational Faslane Naval Base CND demonstration on 14 February 1963, among others.Nuclear Age Peace Foundation. \\"abolition-usa-digest\\", Abolition 2000 Grassroots Newsletter, 14 February 2000, Vol. 1, Number 257. =Attempt to assassinate Franco= On the last day of July 1964, an 18-year-old Christie departed London for Paris, where he picked up plastic explosives from the anarchist organisation Defensa Interior. Before he left England, he was interviewed for a television programme with Malcolm Muggeridge, a known MI6 contact, and asked whether he felt the assassination of Franco would be right. He answered that it would; when the programme was broadcast after his arrest in Spain, these comments were edited out. Christie hitchhiked into Spain and was arrested in Madrid on 11 August 1964 in possession of explosives. He faced a military trial and a possible execution sentence by garrote, but was instead sentenced to twenty years in prison. An accomplice, Fernando Carballo Blanco, was sentenced to thirty years' imprisonment. He served three years in Carabanchel Prison, where he studied for A-Levels and was brought into contact with anarchist prisoners, including Miguel Garc√≠a Garc√≠a, Luis Andres Edo and Juan Busquets. Christie was later freed. The official reason given by Francoist Spain was that it was due to a plea from Christie's mother. =Back in Britain= Industrial Workers of the World picket in Australia in 1981, calling for the release of Christie's wife Brenda from prison After his release he continued his activism in the British anarchist movement, re-formed the Anarchist Black Cross and Black Flag with Albert Meltzer, was acquitted of involvement with the Angry Brigade, and started the publishing house Cienfuegos Press, which for a number of years he operated from Sanday, Orkney, where he also edited and published a local Orcadian newspaper, The Free-Winged Eagle. Christie had various writing and journalistic jobs including as editor of an unauthorised British edition of Pravda and Argumenty i Fakty (Arguments and Facts International) in the late years of the Soviet Union and the early years of the Russian Federation. Published work An updated and single- volume version of his autobiography Granny Made Me an Anarchist was published in 2004 by Scribner.

Christie attracted criticism from some fellow anarchists for making a gestural protest vote against Labour and its war in Iraq by voting for George Galloway's Respect - The Unity Coalition in the European Parliament elections that year. Christie also wrote articles attacking freemasonry. He also wrote, with Meltzer, The Floodgates of Anarchy, which includes an early version of the political compass.

Skull The skull of right The skull of a snake is a very complex structure, with numerous joints to allow the snake to swallow prey far larger than its head. The typical snake skull has a solidly ossified braincase, with the separate frontal bones and the united parietal bones extending downward to the basisphenoid, which is large and extends forward into a rostrum extending to the ethmoidal region. The nose is less ossified, and the paired nasal bones are often attached only at their base. The occipital condyle is either trilobate and formed by the basioccipital and the exoccipitals, or a simple knob formed by the basioccipital; the supraoccipital is excluded from the foramen magnum. The basioccipital may bear a curved ventral process or hypapophysis in the vipers. The prefrontal bone is situated, on each side, between the frontal bone and the maxilla, and may or may not be in contact with the nasal bone. The postfrontal bone, usually present, borders the orbit behind, rarely also above, and in the pythons a supraorbital bone is intercalated between it and the prefrontal bone. The premaxillary bone is single and small, and as a rule connected with the maxillary only by ligament. The paired vomer is narrow. The palatine bone and pterygoid are long and parallel to the axis of the skull, the latter diverging behind and extending to the quadrate or to the articular extremity of the mandible; the pterygoid is connected with the maxillary by the ectopterygoid or transverse bone, which may be very long, and the maxillary often emits a process towards the palatine, the latter bone being usually produced inwards and upwards towards the anterior extremity of the basisphenoid. The quadrate is usually large and elongate, and attached to the cranium through the supratemporal (often regarded as the squamosal). In rare cases, (Polemon) the transverse bone is forked, and articulates with two branches of the maxilla. The quadrate and the maxillary and palatopterygoid arches are more or less movable to allow for the distension required by the passage of prey, often much exceeding the size of the mouth. For the same reason, the rami of the lower jaw, which consist of dentary, splenial, angular, and articular elements, with the addition of a coronoid in the boas and a few other small families, are connected at the symphysis by a very extensible elastic ligament. The hyoid apparatus is reduced to a pair of cartilaginous filaments situated below the trachea, and united in front. There are various modifications according to the genera. A large hole may be present between the frontal bones and the basisphenoid (Psammophis, Coelopeltis); the maxillary may be much abbreviated and movable vertically, as in the Viperidae; the pterygoids may taper and converge posteriorly, without any connection with the quadrate, as in the Amblycephalidae; the supratemporal may be much reduced, and wedged in between the adjacent bones of the cranium; the quadrate may be short or extremely large; the prefrontals may join in a median suture in front of the frontals; the dentary may be freely movable, and detached from the articular posteriorly. The deviation from the normal type is much greater still when we consider the degraded wormlike members of the families Typhlopidae and Glauconiidae, in which the skull is very compact and the maxillary much reduced. In the former this bone is loosely attached to the lower aspect of the cranium; in the latter it borders the mouth, and is suturally joined to the premaxillary and the prefrontal. In both the transverse bone and the supratemporal are absent, but the coronoid element is present in the mandible. =Joints of the snake skull= Lateral view of the skull of a Burmese python, with visible kinetic joints labeled. Red = highly mobile, green = slightly mobile, blue = immobile. Red A: the joint between the mandible and quadrate. It is analogous to the joint in mammal jaws. Red B: the joint between the quadrate and the supratemporal. It is highly mobile in most directions, allowing a wider gape (i.e., the snake can open its mouth wider) and greater jaw flexibility. Red C: the joint between the prefrontal and maxilla. It allows the maxilla to pivot in the plane of the photograph, and while it does not increase gape, it does facilitate the complex action by which the snake draws prey into its mouth. Green A: the joint between the frontal bone and nasal bone. It allows the nose to upturn slightly, increasing gape and assisting in swallowing. Green B: allows the lower jaws to bow outwards, further increasing the gape. Blue: the joint between the supratemporal and parietal. Immobile, except for Dasypeltis. =Snake dentition= In most snakes, teeth are located on the dentary of the lower jaw, the maxilla, the palatine bone and the lateral pterygoid plate. The latter form an \\"inner row\\" of teeth that can move separately from the rest of the jaws and are used to help \\"walk\\" the jaws over prey. Several snake lineages have evolved venom which is typically delivered by specialized teeth called fangs located on the maxilla. Most snakes can be placed into one of four groups, based on their teeth, which correlate strongly with venom and lineage. Aglyph An aglyphous snake. A Burmese python skull (Python bivittatus)Aglyphous snakes (lacking grooves) have no specialized teeth; each tooth is similar in shape and often size. When teeth vary in size, as in some bird eaters, they do not vary in shape. Most aglyphous snakes are non- venomous; some, like Thamnophis, are considered mildly venomous. The feature is not a synapomorphy. Opisthoglyph An opisthoglyphous snake. A hognose snake skull (Heterodon nasicus)Opisthoglyphous (\\"rearward grooves\\") snakes possess venom injected by a pair of enlarged teeth at the back of the maxillae, which normally angle backward and are grooved to channel venom into the puncture. Since these fangs are not located at the front of the mouth, this arrangement is vernacularly called \\"rear-fanged\\". In order to envenomate prey, an opisthoglyphous snake must move the prey into the rear of its mouth and then penetrate it with its fangs, presenting difficulties with large prey although they can quickly move smaller prey into position. The opisthoglyphous dentition appears at least two times in the history of snakes.Bruna Azara, C. (1995). \\"Animales venenosos. Vertebrados terrestres venenosos peligrosos para el ser humano en Espa√±a \\". Bol. SEA 11: 32-40. The venom of some opisthoglyphous snakes is strong enough to harm humans; notably, herpetologists Karl Schmidt and Robert Mertens were killed by a boomslang and a twig snake, respectively, after each underestimated the effects of the bite and failed to seek medical help. Opisthoglyphous snakes are found in the family Colubridae. Proteroglyph A proteroglyphous snake. A king cobra skull (Ophiophagus hannah)Proteroglyphous snakes (forward grooved) have shortened maxillae bearing few teeth except for a substantially enlarged fang pointing downwards and completely folded around the venom channel, forming a hollow needle. Because the fangs are only a fraction of an inch long in even the largest species these snakes must hang on, at least momentarily, as they inject their venom.LD50 for various snakes Some spitting cobras have modified fang tips allowing them to spray venom at an attacker's eyes. This form of dentition is unique to elapids. Solenoglyph A solenoglyphous snake. A rattlesnake skull (Crotalus sp.)Solenoglyphous snakes (pipe grooved) have the most advanced venom delivery method of any snake. Each maxilla is reduced to a nub supporting a single hollow fang tooth. The fangs, which can be as long as half the length of the head, are folded against the roof of the mouth, pointing posteriorly. The skull has a series of interacting elements that ensure that the fangs rotate into biting position when the jaws open. Solenoglyphous snakes open their mouths almost 180 degrees, and the fangs swing into a position to allow them to penetrate deep into the prey. While solenoglyph venom is typically less toxic than that of proteroglyphs, this system allows them to deeply inject large quantities of venom. This form of dentition is unique to vipers. Exceptions A few snakes do not conform to these categories. Atractaspis is solenoglyphous but the fangs swing out sideways, allowing it to strike without opening its mouth, perhaps allowing it to hunt in small tunnels. Scolecophidia (blind burrowing snakes) typically have few teeth, often only in the upper jaw or lower jaw. Informal or popular terminology Common names for the various types of snake dentition originate largely from older literature, but still are encountered in informal publications. Aglyphous snakes are commonly called fangless; opisthoglyphous snakes rear-fanged or back-fanged; and both Proteroglyphous and Solenoglyphous snakes are referred to as front-fanged.Rose, Walter; The reptiles and amphibians of southern Africa; Pub: Maskew Miller, 1950Engelmann, Wolf- Eberhard.

Vertebrae and ribs The vertebral column consists of an atlas (composed of two vertebrae) without ribs; numerous precaudal vertebrae, all of which, except the first or first three, bear long, movable, curved ribs with a small posterior tubercle at the base, the last of these ribs sometimes forked; two to ten so-called lumbar vertebrae without ribs, but with bifurcate transverse processes (lymphapophyses) enclosing the lymphatic vessels; and a number of ribless caudal vertebrae with simple transverse processes. When bifid, the ribs or transverse processes have the branches regularly superposed. The centra have the usual ball and socket joint, with the nearly hemispherical or transversely elliptic condyle at the back (procoelous vertebrae), while the neural arch is provided with additional articular surfaces in the form of pre- and post- zygapophyses, broad, flattened, and overlapping, and of a pair of anterior wedge-shaped processes called zygosphene, fitting into a pair of corresponding concavities, zygantrum, just below the base of the neural spine. Thus the vertebrae of snakes articulate with each other by eight joints in addition to the cup-and-ball on the centrum, and interlock by parts reciprocally receiving and entering one another, like the mortise and tenon jointery. The precaudal vertebrae have a more or less high neural spine which, as a rare exception (Xenopholis), may be expanded and plate-like above, and short or moderately long transverse processes to which the ribs are attached by a single facet. The centra of the anterior vertebrae emit more or less developed descending processes, or haemapophyses, which are sometimes continued throughout, as in Tropidonotus, Vipera, and Ancistrodon, among European genera. In the caudal region, elongate transverse processes take the place of ribs, and the haemapophyses are paired, one on each side of the haemal canal. In the rattlesnakes the seven or eight last vertebrae are enlarged and fused into one. Vestigial limbs Boelens python showing the bones inside the anal spurs No living snake shows any remains of the pectoral arch, but remains of the pelvis are found in: *Boas and Pythons: a long ilium, attached to the lower branch of the first bifurcate transverse process of the lumbar vertebrae, bearing three short bones, the longest of which, regarded as the femur, terminates in a claw-like pelvic spur which usually appears externally on each side of the cloaca. *Leptotyphlopidae: ilium, pubis, and ischium, and rudimentary femur, the ischium forming a ventral symphysis. *Aniliidae *Typhlopidae: a single bone on each side.

Its name comes from its association with St. George's Episcopal Church at Stuyvesant Square, Manhattan.\\"Year Book of St. George's Church: Stuyvesant Square, New York, Easter, 1896\\", St. George's Church (New York, N.Y.), 240 pages. It hosted the first international cricket match in 1844, between Canada and the United States. The club was founded in 1838. Nicknamed the Dragonslayers, the SGCC set the standard of US cricket from 1838 to the Civil War. Most of its playing members were British-born and excluded Americans from participating in their \\"English game\\". The local resentment of this English social exclusivity amongst New York ball players may have been the impetus for cricket to be designated as an \\"English\\" game in the US, though it had been played for over a century at the time. The SGCC club travelled to Canada on several occasions in the 1850s, encouraging a touring tradition for American sports which culminated in George Parr's All England XI visiting New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal in 1859. This was the first occasion that a professional team of players in any sport had played in the United States. The All England Team of professionals played a US XXII team that included five SGCC players. St George's continued its dominant New York cricket organizational role until 1876, when the founding of the New York Metropolitan league and the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club at Walker Park ushered in a new era of league cricket in New York.Sentance Its first ground was located in Midtown Manhattan off of Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) between 30th and 31st Street. The ground was located behind the Casper Samler farmstead, which was later replaced by the Gilsey Hotel. This ground was the site of many matches, including the first international cricket match in 1844. In the 1850s, economic development in Midtown necessitated that the club move to a new ground in Harlem. This ground was known colloquially and in news articles as the \\"Red House\\" ground and was located between what is now 105th and 106th streets and First Avenue. The Red House ground played host to domestic competitions between teams from New York and Philadelphia, as well as international matches with Canadian teams including the 1853 match between the US and Canada. Ultimately, the team relocated to Hoboken, New Jersey. After the Civil War, St George's was slated to get a ground in Central Park before moving to Hudson City. St George's opponents included the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, the Philadelphia Cricket Club, and the Toronto Cricket Club. George Wright includes a picture of St George's cricket grounds in his biography. George Wright's older brother Harry also played for St George's team. The Wrights' father, Samuel, was the professional groundskeeper for team and is depicted, along with his son Harry, in a famous daguerreotype holding a cricket bat while Harry holds a baseball bat.

It was preceded by The IPCRESS File and followed by Funeral in Berlin. Background The novel is set in 1960, mostly in a small fishing village in Portugal, during the Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar dictatorship. It retains the style of The IPCRESS File -- multiple plots twists, Gauloises cigarettes, the grime- and soot-stained British winter. In common with several of Deighton's other early novels, the chapter headings have a running theme. In Horse Under Water these are crossword puzzle clues, reflecting the protagonist's habit of endlessly writing and replacing words in crossword puzzles. The first edition of Horse Under Water published by Jonathan Cape was shorter than the later Penguin edition, which included a detailed description of the anonymous British agent's diving course and also introduced characters later seen in the book, such as Chief Petty Officer Edwardes. Plot The plot centres on retrieving items from a Type XXI U-boat sunk off the Portuguese coast in the last days of World War II. Initially, the items are forged British and American currency, for financing a revolution in Portugal on the cheap. Later, it switches to heroin (the \\"Horse\\" of the title), and eventually it is revealed that the true interest is in the \\"Weiss list\\" - a list of Britons prepared to help the Third Reich set up a puppet government in Britain, should Germany prevail. Thrown into the mix is secret \\"ice melting\\" technology, which could be vital to the missile submarines then beginning to hide under the Arctic sea ice. Technology The secret weather buoys generally used by the wartime Kriegsmarine were not as sophisticated as the one described in the novel.

This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, in English, k replacing c), or symbol (for example, in languages using the Latin character set, $ replacing s, or üÖ±Ô∏è replacing b). Satiric misspelling is found widely today in informal writing on the Internet, but can also be found in some serious political writing that opposes the status quo.  K replacing c  =In political writing= Replacing the letter c with k in the first letter of a word came into use by the Ku Klux Klan during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century. The concept is continued today within the group. For something similar in the writing of groups opposed to the KKK, see , below. Barcelona squat and anarchist centre, labelled \\"OKUPA Y RESISTE\\" In the 1960s and early 1970s in the United States, the Yippies sometimes used Amerika rather than America in referring to the United States. According to Oxford Dictionaries, it was an allusion to the Russian and German spellings of the word and intended to be suggestive of fascism and authoritarianism. A similar usage in Italian, Spanish, Catalan and Portuguese is to write okupa rather than ocupa (often on a building or area occupied by squatters, referring to the name adopted by okupaci√≥n activist groups). It stems from a combination of English borrow words with k in them to those languages, and Spanish anarchist and punk movements which used \\"k\\" to signal rebellion. =In humor= Replacing \\"c\\" with \\"k\\" was at the center of a Monty Python joke from the Travel Agent sketch. Eric Idle has an affliction that makes him pronounce the letter C as a B, as in \\"bolour\\" instead of \\"colour.\\" Michael Palin asks him if he can say the letter K? Idle replies that he can, and Palin suggests that he spell words with a K instead of C. Idle replies, \\"what, spell bolour with a K? Kolour. Oh! I never thought of that before! What a silly bunt!\\" =KKK replacing c or k= A common satiric usage of the letters KKK is the spelling of America as Amerikkka, alluding to the Ku Klux Klan, referring to underlying racism in American society. The earliest known usage of Amerikkka recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary is in July 1970, in an African-American magazine called Black World. The spelling Amerikkka came into greater use after the 1990 release of the gangsta rap album AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted by Ice Cube. The letters KKK have been inserted into several other words and names, to indicate similar perceived racism, oppression or corruption. Examples include: * Republikkkan (U.S. Republican Party) * Demokkkrat (U.S. Democratic Party) * KKKapitalism (capitalism) * David DuKKKe (David Duke), former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, candidate for United States Senate, candidate for Governor of Louisiana, and web antisemitic conspiracy theorist Currency signs The currency symbols (¬¢, ‚Ç¨, Ôø°, ‚ÇΩ, ‚Çπ, $, ‚Ç©, ¬•) can be inserted in place of the letters (C, E, L, P, R, S, W, Y) to indicate plutocracy, greed, corruption, or the perceived immoral, unethical, or pathological accumulation of money. For example: * Bu$h (for George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, or the Bush family) * Congre$$ (for United States Congress) * Co$ or $cientology (for the Church of Scientology): see also Scientology controversies. * Di$ney and Di$neyland (for The Walt Disney Company and Disneyland): see also Criticism of The Walt Disney Company and Disneyland ¬ß Tickets * E$$o (for Esso): Used by the UK-based Stop Esso campaign encouraging people to boycott Esso, in protest against Esso's opposition to the Kyoto Protocol. * ‚Ç¨urope (for Europe) *Ke$ha (singer- songwriter): adopted the dollar sign in her name while financially struggling as an ironic gesture. *Micro$oft, M$, M$FT (for Microsoft): see also Criticism of Microsoft * $ony (for Sony) *United $tates (for the United States) Word- in-word Occasionally a word written in its orthodox spelling is altered with internal capital letters, hyphens, italics, or other devices so as to highlight a fortuitous pun. Some examples: * After the controversial 2000 United States presidential election, the alleged improprieties of the election prompted the use of such titles as \\"pResident\\" and \\"(p)resident\\" for George W. Bush. The same effects were also used for Bill Clinton during and after Clinton's impeachment hearings. These devices were intended to suggest that the president was merely the resident of the White House rather than the legitimate leader. * The controversial United States law USA PATRIOT Act is sometimes called \\"USA PAT RIOT Act\\" or \\"(Pat)Riot Act\\" by its opponents. This is done to avoid using the common term Patriot Act, which implies the law is patriotic. * Feminist theologian Mary Daly has used a slash to make a point about patriarchy: \\"gyn/ecology\\", \\"stag/nation\\", \\"the/rapist\\". * In French, where con is an insulting word meaning \\"moron\\", the word conservateur (conservative) has been written \\"con-servateur\\", \\"con... servateur\\", or \\"con(servateur)\\". The American English term neo-con, an abbreviation of neo- conservative, becomes a convenient pun when used in French. In English, the first syllable of conservative can be emphasized to suggest a con artist. * Netizens often called Sen. Ramon \\"Bong\\" Revilla Jr. as \\"MandaramBONG\\" (Filipino word for plunderer) to highlight allegations that he pocketed pork barrel funds through the use of fake non-government organizations. *Jair Bolsonaro has been called BolsoNero, due to the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires and indifference to the COVID-19 pandemic.  üÖ±Ô∏è replacing hard consonants  The negative squared letter B (üÖ±Ô∏è; originally used to represent blood type B) can be used to replace hard consonants as an internet meme. This originates from the practice of members of the Bloods replacing the letter C with the letter B, but has been extended to any consonant.Smith, Debra; Whitmore, Kathryn F. (2006). Literacy and Advocacy in Adolescent Family, Gang, School, and Juvenile Court Communities. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . Common examples are: * NiüÖ±üÖ±a, replacing nigga. This has been criticized as a way for non-Blacks to get around the taboo of saying the \\"N-word\\". *üÖ±loods for Bloods *üÖ±eter for Peter Griffin  Other significant respellings  Along the same lines, intentional misspellings can be used to promote a specific negative attribute, real or perceived, of a product or service. This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities. Journalists may make a politicized editorial decision by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticisms, dialect variants, or interjections. The British political satire magazine Private Eye has a long- standing theme of insulting the law firm Carter-Ruck by replacing the R with an F to read Carter-Fuck. The law firm once requested that Private Eye cease spelling its name like that; the magazine then started spelling it \\"Farter- Fuck\\". Likewise, Private Eye often refers to The Guardian as The Grauniad, due to the newspaper's early reputation for typographical errors. =Backronyms= Plays on acronyms and initialisms are also common, when the full name is spelled out but one of the component words is replaced by another. For example, Richard Stallman and other Free Software Foundation executives often refer to digital rights management as \\"digital restrictions management\\",Digital rights management#Opposition to DRM a reference to the tendency for DRM to stifle the end user's ability to reshare music or write CDs more than a certain number of times. Likewise, the National Security Agency is often referred to as the \\"National Surveillance Agency\\" and sometimes \\"National Socialist Agency\\"http://quartermoonsaloon.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-21247.html by opponents of its PRISM program, who view it as dystopian encroachment on personal privacy.

Twelve muqams The twelve muqams are: #Rak (; , LƒÅk√®) #ƒå√§bbiyat (; , Qiƒõb«êy«ét√®) #Segah (; , Sƒ´g«é) #ƒåahargah (; , Qi√†ƒõrg«é) #P√§njigah (; , PƒÅnƒõrg«é) #√ñzhal (; , W≈´zƒ´hƒÅlƒìi) #√Ñj√§m (; , √Äiqiƒõ) #U≈°≈°aq (; , W≈´xi√†k√®) #Bayat (; , BƒÅy«ét√≠) #Nava (; , N√†w«é) #Mu≈°avr√§k (; , M√πxi√†w√∫l√°ik√®) #Iraq (; , Yƒ´lƒÅk√®) Each of the 12 muqams consists of a main section that begins with a long free rhythm introduction, followed by pieces with characteristic rhythmic patterns that gradually increase in speed. Each muqam consists of three parts, including naghma, dastan and mashrap. These pieces are arranged in the same sequence in each muqam, although not all muqams have the same pieces. These parts are known as t√§z√§, nuskha, small s√§liq√§, jula, s√§n√§m, large s√§liq√§, p√§shru and t√§kit. Some have an associated instrumental piece known as a m√§rghul (\\"decoration\\") following it. Although each named piece has its characteristic rhythmic pattern, the melodies differ, so each piece is generally known by the muqam and the piece: for example, \\"the Rak nuskha\\" or \\"the Segah jula\\". There are about 20 to 30 pieces of songs and musics, which might take approximately 2 hours to finish performing. It will take about 24 hours to perform all pieces of 12 muqams. After the main section, there are two other sections, originally associated with other musical traditions, but included in muqams by performers such as Turdi Akhun and therefore included in the present 12 muqam tradition. The Dastan section includes songs from several of the romantic dastan narratives found widely in Central and South Asia and the Middle East. Each dastan song is followed by an instrumental m√§rghul. The M√§shr√§p section consists of more lively dance songs that were originally connected with the performances of sama by dervish musicians of Turkistan. History and preservation Museum for Muqam in Hami, Xinjiang The precursor to Muqam, the \\"Great Western Region Melody\\" () developed during the Han (206 BCE-220 CE) and Tang (618-907) dynasties, from which it was imported and enjoyed in the courts of Central China. It was somewhat influenced by the Arabic maqam modal system that has led to many musical genres among peoples of Eurasia and North Africa. Uyghurs have local muqam systems named after the oasis towns of Xinjiang, such as Dolan, Ili, Kumul and Turpan. The most fully developed at this point is the Western Tarim region's 12 muqams, which are now a large canon of music and songs recorded from the traditional performers Turdi Akhun and Omar Akhun among others in the 1950s and edited into a more systematic system. Although the folk performers probably improvised their songs as in Turkish taksim performances, the present institutional canon is performed as fixed compositions by ensembles. The concubine Amanni Shahan of the Yerqiang kingdom (1526-1560) is credited with collecting and thereby preserving the Twelve Muqam, while reshaping its style to draw more from the indigenous traditions of the Tian Shan mountains and purging it of the Perso-Arabic. After the 1949 Chinese Revolution, the state commissioned musicians Wan Tongshu and Turdi Akhun to record the Muqams on tape, so that it could not be lost. They published their first album in 1960. From 2004 to 2008, over 7,000 performers have collaborated in a Chinese state project to proliferate seminars, research projects and recordings of the Muqam. In 2005, UNESCO designated The Uyghur Muqam of Xinjiang as part of the Intangible Heritage of Humanity. See also *Persian traditional music References *Rachel Harris.

It is often the final step in this process, and is usually done in a ceremonial capacity. An oath of citizenship is designed to be a statement of patriotism and loyalty to the new country. In countries which retain a monarchical system of government, an oath of allegiance to the monarch is often required as well. Adding an oath to God to the end of an oath is usually optional. Oaths =Brazil= Portuguese version: > Declaro expressamente que assumo o compromisso de bem cumprir os deveres de > cidad√£o brasileiro, observando e respeitando os preceitos da Constitui√ß√£o > Federal. The English translation: > I expressly declare that I assume the commitment to well comply the > Brazilian citizen duties, observing and respecting the principles of the > Federal Constitution. =Canada= The Oath of Citizenship, or Citizenship Oath (in French: serment de citoyennet√©), is a statement recited and signed by candidates who wish to become citizens of Canada. Administered at a ceremony presided over by assigned officers, most often a citizenship judge. The oath is a promise or declaration of fealty to Canada in the name of the Canadian monarch and a promise to abide by Canada's laws and customs; upon signing the oath, citizenship is granted to the signer. New citizens must take the oath. As Canada is officially bilingual in English and French,the presiding official leads new citizens in both languages at citizenship ceremonies. It is mandatory that the presiding official and/or the citizenship officials observe each applicant reciting the oath. English version: > I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her > Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and > Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada and fulfil > my duties as a Canadian citizen. French versions: Oath: > Je jure fid√©lit√© et sinc√®re all√©geance √† Sa Majest√© la Reine Elizabeth Deux, > Reine du Canada, √† ses h√©ritiers et successeurs et je jure d'observer > fid√®lement les lois du Canada et de remplir loyalement mes obligations de > citoyen canadien.

New citizens take an oath to that effect at the end of their naturalization process: > Giuro di essere fedele alla Repubblica e di osservare la Costituzione e le > leggi dello Stato. > I swear to be faithful to the Republic and to observe the Constitution and > the laws of the State. =Jamaica= > I, [name], do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her > Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Her Heirs and Successors, according to law and > that I will faithfully observe the laws of Jamaica and fulfill my duties as > a citizen of Jamaica. =New Zealand= According to New Zealand law, new citizens are given the option of taking the oath in either English or Maori when swearing in at a citizenship ceremony.

Part 337 (2008)) is an oath that must be taken by all immigrants who wish to become United States citizens. > I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and > abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, > or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; > that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United > States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will > bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf > of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform > noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required > by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian > direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely > without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. For people who object to taking an oath (or are not religious), the words \\"on oath\\" can be replaced with \\"and solemnly affirm\\", and the words \\"so help me God\\" can be omitted. Pledges In some countries, a pledge is taken by a new citizen, as opposed to an oath. =Australia= Officially called the \\"Pledge of Commitment\\": :From this time forward, [under God], :I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, :whose democratic beliefs I share, :whose rights and liberties I respect, :and whose laws I will uphold and obey. All new citizens have the choice of making the pledge with or without the words \\"under God\\". =Norway= > Som norsk statsborger lover jeg troskap til mitt land Norge og det norske > samfunnet, og jeg st√∏tter demokratiet og menneskerettighetene og vil > respektere landets lover. > As a citizen of Norway I pledge loyalty to my country Norway and the > Norwegian society, and I support democracy and human rights and will respect > the laws of the country. Applicants for Norwegian citizenship are not required to take the oath; it is optional. =Romania= > Jur sƒÉ fiu devotat patriei ≈üi poporului rom√¢n, sƒÉ apƒÉr drepturile ≈üi > interesele na≈£ionale, sƒÉ respect Constitu≈£ia ≈üi legile Rom√¢niei > I pledge my devotion to my country and to the Romanian people, to defend the > nation's rights and interests, to respect the Constitution and laws of > Romania =United Kingdom= Since 1 January 2004, applicants for British citizenship are also required, in addition to swearing the oath or affirmation of allegiance, to make a pledge to the United Kingdom as follows: > I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and > freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws > faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen. Persons acquiring British overseas territories citizenship make an equivalent pledge to the relevant British Overseas Territory. In the very unusual cases of an acquisition of British Overseas citizenship, or British subject status, no pledge would be required.

A sequence (x_n) that converges to x^* is said to have order of convergence q \\\\geq 1 and rate of convergence \\\\mu if : \\\\lim _{n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\left|x_{n+1}-x^{*}\\\\right|}{\\\\left|x_{n}-x^{*}\\\\right|^{q}}=\\\\mu. The rate of convergence \\\\mu is also called the asymptotic error constant. In practice, the rate and order of convergence provide useful insights when using iterative methods for calculating numerical approximations. If the order of convergence is higher, then typically fewer iterations are necessary to yield a useful approximation. Strictly speaking, however, the asymptotic behavior of a sequence does not give conclusive information about any finite part of the sequence. Similar concepts are used for discretization methods. The solution of the discretized problem converges to the solution of the continuous problem as the grid size goes to zero, and the speed of convergence is one of the factors of the efficiency of the method. However, the terminology, in this case, is different from the terminology for iterative methods. Series acceleration is a collection of techniques for improving the rate of convergence of a series discretization. Such acceleration is commonly accomplished with sequence transformations. Convergence speed for iterative methods =Q-convergence definitions= Suppose that the sequence (x_k) converges to the number L. The sequence is said to converge Q-linearly to L if there exists a number \\\\mu \\\\in (0, 1) such that : \\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{|x_{k+1} - L|}{|x_k - L|} = \\\\mu. The number \\\\mu is called the rate of convergence. The sequence is said to converge Q-superlinearly to L (i.e. faster than linearly) if : \\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{|x_{k+1} - L|}{|x_k - L|} = 0 and it is said to converge Q-sublinearly to L (i.e. slower than linearly) if : \\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{|x_{k+1} - L|}{|x_k - L|} = 1. If the sequence converges sublinearly and additionally :\\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{|x_{k+2} - x_{k+1}|}{|x_{k+1} - x_k|} = 1, then it is said that the sequence (x_k) converges logarithmically to L. Note that unlike previous definitions, logarithmic convergence is not called \\"Q-logrithmic.\\" In order to further classify convergence, the order of convergence is defined as follows. The sequence is said to converge with order q to L for q \\\\geq 1 if :\\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{|x_{k+1} - L|}{|x_k - L|^q} < M for some positive constant M > 0 (not necessarily less than 1). In particular, convergence with order * q = 1 is called linear convergence, * q = 2 is called quadratic convergence, * q = 3 is called cubic convergence, * etc. Some sources require that q is strictly greater than 1. It is not necessary, however, that q be an integer. For example, the secant method, when converging to a regular, simple root, has an order of œÜ ‚âà 1.618. In the definitions above, the \\"Q-\\" stands for \\"quotient\\" because the terms are defined using the quotient between two successive terms. Often, however, the \\"Q-\\" is dropped and a sequence is simply said to have linear convergence, quadratic convergence, etc. Order estimation A practical method to calculate the order of convergence for a sequence is to calculate the following sequence, which converges to q :q \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\left|\\\\frac{x_{k+1} - x_k}{x_k - x_{k-1}}\\\\right|}{\\\\log \\\\left|\\\\frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{x_{k-1} - x_{k-2}}\\\\right|}. =R-convergence definition= The Q-convergence definitions have a shortcoming in that they do not include some sequences, such as the sequence (b_k) below, which converge reasonably fast, but whose rate is variable. Therefore, the definition of rate of convergence is extended as follows. Suppose that (x_k) converges to L. The sequence is said to converge R-linearly to L if there exists there exists a sequence (\\\\varepsilon_k) such that : |x_k - L|\\\\le\\\\varepsilon_k\\\\quad\\\\text{for all }k \\\\,, and (\\\\varepsilon_k) converges Q-linearly to zero. The \\"R-\\" prefix stands for \\"root\\". =Examples= Consider the sequence :(a_k) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{1, \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{8}, \\\\frac{1}{16}, \\\\frac{1}{32}, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{1}{2^k}, ... \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. It can be shown that this sequence converges to L = 0. To determine the type of convergence, we plug the sequence into the definition of Q-linear convergence, :\\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\left1/2^{k+1} - 0\\\\right|}{\\\\left1/ 2^k - 0 \\\\right|} = \\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{2^k}{2^{k+1}} = \\\\frac{1}{2}. Thus, we find that (a_k) converges Q-linearly and has a convergence rate of \\\\mu = 1/2. More generally, for any c \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\mu \\\\in (-1, 1), the sequence (c\\\\mu^k) converges linearly with rate \\\\mu. The sequence :(b_k) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{1, 1, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{16}, \\\\frac{1}{16}, \\\\ldots,\\\\frac{1}{4^{\\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{k}{2} \\\\right\\\\rfloor}} ,\\\\, \\\\ldots \\\\right\\\\\\\\} also converges linearly to 0 with rate 1/2 under the R-convergence definition, but not under the Q-convergence definition. (Note that \\\\lfloor x \\\\rfloor is the floor function, which gives the largest integer that is less than or equal to x.) The sequence :(c_k) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{16}, \\\\frac{1}{256}, \\\\frac{1}{65,\\\\\\\\!536}, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{1}{2^{2^k}}, \\\\ldots \\\\right\\\\\\\\} converges superlinearly. In fact, it is quadratically convergent. Finally, the sequence :(d_k) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{1, \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\frac{1}{5}, \\\\frac{1}{6}, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{1}{k + 1}, \\\\ldots \\\\right\\\\\\\\} converges sublinearly and logarithmically. center Convergence speed for discretization methods A similar situation exists for discretization methods. The important parameter here for the convergence speed is not the iteration number k, but the number of grid points and grid spacing. In this case, the number of grid points n in a discretization process is inversely proportional to the grid spacing. In this case, a sequence (x_n) is said to converge to L with order q if there exists a constant C such that : |x_n - L< C n^{-q} \\\\text{ for all } n. This is written as |x_n - L = \\\\mathcal{O}(n^{-q}) using big O notation. This is the relevant definition when discussing methods for numerical quadrature or the solution of ordinary differential equations. A practical method to estimate the order of convergence for a discretization method is pick step sizes h_\\\\text{new} and h_\\\\text{old} and calculate the resulting errors e_\\\\text{new} and e_\\\\text{old}. The order of convergence is then approximated by the following formula: :q \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\log(e_\\\\text{new}/e_\\\\text{old})}{\\\\log(h_\\\\text{new}/h_\\\\text{old})}. = Examples (continued)= The sequence (d_k) with d_k = 1/(k+1) was introduced above. This sequence converges with order 1 according to the convention for discretization methods. The sequence (a_k) with a_k = 2^{-k}, which was also introduced above, converges with order q for every number q. It is said to converge exponentially using the convention for discretization methods. However, it only converges linearly (that is, with order 1) using the convention for iterative methods. The order of convergence of a discretization method is related to its global truncation error (GTE). Acceleration of convergence Many methods exist to increase the rate of convergence of a given sequence, i.e. to transform a given sequence into one converging faster to the same limit. Such techniques are in general known as \\"series acceleration\\". The goal of the transformed sequence is to reduce the computational cost of the calculation. One example of series acceleration is Aitken's delta-squared process.

Claymills Pumping Station is a restored Victorian sewage pumping station on the north side of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England. It was designed by James Mansergh and used to pump sewage to the sewage farm at Egginton. Beam of the 'D' engine The main pumping plant consists of four Woolf compound, rotative, beam pumping engines. These are arranged in mirror image pairs, in two separate engine houses, with a central boiler house (containing five Lancashire boilers with economisers) and chimney. The engines were built in 1885 by Gimson and Company of Leicester. All the engines are similar, and the following description is limited to only one, but applicable to all. The high-pressure cylinder is 24-inch bore by 6-foot stroke, and the low-pressure cylinder is 38-inch bore by 8-foot stroke. Steam is distributed by means of double beat 'Cornish' valves, mounted in upper and lower valve chests. The cylinders act on one end of the beam, via Watt's parallel motion. The beam itself is 26 feet 4 inches between end centres, 4 feet deep at the centre, weighs 13 tons and is carried on bearings. Currently B, C and D engines are in steam around 13 times a year, with A engine still in the unrestored state. The Clay Mills Trust has now decided to restore the last unrestored beam engine, A engine. It will be restored to an operational state taking into consideration its history since last operating in 1969. The modern sewage works, run by Severn Trent Water, is alongside the pumping station.

Capturing the bay from the Spanish forces was instrumental in the following Battle of Santiago de Cuba and the subsequent invasion of Puerto Rico. Although overshadowed by the land and sea battles at Santiago, the establishment of the United States naval base at Guant√°namo Bay and the rout of defending Spanish troops by American and Cuban forces was important in the final Spanish defeat. Background Cuba had been in rebellion against Spain since 1895. Soon after the rebellion began, two insurgent leaders ‚Äì Jos√© Mart√≠ and General M√°ximo G√≥mez ‚Äì had landed at the beach of Cajobabo, between Guant√°namo Bay and Cape Mais√≠, but after three years of fighting throughout the island, the rebels had only been successful in two provinces ‚Äì Oriente and Camag√ºey. Following the explosion of the battleship in Havana harbor in February 1898, the U.S. declared war on Spain in support of the Cuban insurgents. Havana harbor was blockaded, and by the end of May the Spanish fleet was bottled up in Santiago Bay, west of Guant√°namo Bay, by Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. In the U.S., an army expeditionary force was rapidly being readied at the same time for action in Cuba. Thus, America was allied with the Cuban insurgents. Guant√°namo Bay had a measure of commercial importance because of the sugar port of Caimanera on the western shore of the inner bay, some five statute miles (8 km) from the sea. =Spanish positions= Despite the nominal offensive position of the insurgents in the vicinity of Guant√°namo Bay, Spanish regulars and guerrillas held Guant√°namo City, the port of Caimanera and the railroad connecting the two cities, the large sugar mills, and other outlying strong points. The Guant√°namo garrison consisted of some 5,000 menTitherington, Richard H., Our War With Spain, Munsey's Magazine, October 1898 ‚Äì March 1899, New York: Frank A. Munsey, Publisher, pp. 907‚Äì908: A contemporary source quotes 5,000 troops at Guant√°namo, while others state the number was closer to 7,000 troops under the command of General Felix Pareja. A Spanish blockhouse stood on the hill overlooking the village on Fisherman's Point near the entrance to the bay, and a fort on Cayo del Toro commanded the relatively narrow channel leading from outer to inner bay. The Spanish gunboat Sandoval was based at Caimanera on the inner bay, and a string of blockhouses defended the railroad to Guant√°namo City, inland. The Cuban insurgents maintained coastal outposts from the mouth of the Yateras River, east of the bay, to a point west of Santiago, and were in undisputed possession of the western point at the entrance to the bay. Battle =Naval battle of Guant√°namo Bay= The first successful U.S. foray against Guant√°namo Bay occurred on 6 June, with the arrival of the light cruiser , captained by Commander Bowman H. McCalla, and the auxiliary cruisers and , commanded by Willard H. Brownson. Commander McCalla had been detached by Admiral Sampson from the blockading fleet at Santiago and ordered to reconnoiter the bay for a naval base. The captain of St. Louis was to cut the cables which had their terminus in a small station on Fisherman's Point, and connected Cuba with Haiti and the outside world. On a previous occasion, St. Louis, on a similar mission, had been driven from the bay by the Spanish gunboat Sandoval. This time, as the three warships came into the bay at dawn, Spanish soldiers clustered about the blockhouse on the hill known today as McCalla Hill. The blockhouse and the village were speedily cleared by fire from Marbleheads six-pounder gun, along with a single shell. The Spanish gunboats Alvarado and Sandoval came down the channel from Caimanera to meet the attack but retired precipitately on discovering the caliber of guns against them. The one cannon of the fort on Cayo del Toro opened fire on Marblehead without effect until it was silenced. The telegraph cables leading east to Cap-Ha√Øtien, west to Santiago, and the small cable in the bay connecting Caimanera and Guant√°namo City with Cap-Ha√Øtien were all successfully cut, and from 7 June to 5 July the town of Guant√°namo had no communication with the outside world. Upon returning to the blockading fleet from the reconnaissance, Marblehead carried two Cuban officers who had been brought off to the ship from Leeward Point (the western side) of Guant√°namo Bay. They had been sent to Admiral Sampson by General Calixto Garc√≠a (the same who figured with U.S. Lieutenant Rowan in the famous \\"A Message to Garcia\\") to report that the Cuban forces, whose outposts occupied positions on the coast from the mouth of the Yateras to a point west of Santiago were at the disposition of the U.S. Commander-in-Chief. Commander McCalla thereafter maintained close liaison with General Pedro P√©rez, commanding the Cuban forces around Guant√°namo City, through the latter's Chief of Staff, Colonel Vieta, and thus received valuable advice and assistance.Murphy, Marion E., The History of Guantanamo Bay, US Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, (1953), pp. 3-4 =Marine assault landing= Aerial view of Guant√°namo Bay With the decision to establish a base at Guant√°namo Bay, the First Battalion of Marines, consisting of six companies of around 650 men (four infantry and one artillery company), was ordered to proceed in the converted transport , and join the fleet off Santiago.Daugherty, Leo J., Pioneers of Amphibious Warfare, 1898‚Äì1945: Profiles of Fourteen American Military Strategists, McFarland Press, , (2009), pp. 23‚Äì31 The First Battalion, under the command of Lt. Col. Robert W. Huntington USMC, had been undergoing battalion exercises while awaiting orders at Key West. The Panther reached Santiago on 9 June 1898. That same day, in advance of the battalion landing, Navy Commander Bowman H. McCalla of the , the officer in command of the landings, approved a camp site selected for the Marines by Lt. Col. Huntington. The site selected was a flat ridge on top of a hill, above the village on Fisherman's Point, and designated Camp McCalla. In addition to an artillery company equipped with a battery of four 3-inch rapid-firing artillery pieces and a Model 1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine gun, each marine was equipped with the Navy's new rapid-firing magazine rifle, the Model 1895 Lee Navy. Both the Colt machine gun and the Lee rifles used a new high-velocity smokeless powder cartridge, the 6 mm Lee Navy. The Marine battalion landed unopposed on 10 June with five of its six companies,Keeler, Frank and Tyson, Carolyn A. (ed.), The Journal of Frank Keeler, 1898, (ed., with Appendix) Washington, D.C.: Marine Corps Letters Series, No. 1, Training and Education Command, (1967) leaving the artillery company aboard to unload the ship, as Commander Reiter, the captain of the Panther, had refused to authorize the use of ship's personnel for unloading duties. Reiter also refused to permit the unloading of the remainder of the Marines' small arms ammunition, claiming that it was needed as ship's ballast. Lt. Col. Huntington sought assistance from Commander McCalla, who ordered Reiter to release the Marines' ammunition at once: \\"Sir, break out immediately and land with the crew of the Panther, 50,000 rounds of 6-mm. ammunition,\\" McCalla ordered. \\"In the future, do not require Colonel Huntington to break out or land his stores with members of his command. Use your own officers and men for this purpose, and supply the Commanding Officer of Marines promptly with anything he may desire.\\"Keene, R.R., \\"The Battle for Cuzco Well\\", Leatherneck Magazine, September 1998, p. 22 The Marines burned crude huts of the village and the remains of the blockhouse with all their contents to avoid the possibility of yellow fever. The Spanish had fled in such a hurry that clothing, money, jewelry and weapons had been left behind. The battalion raised the American flag, the first U.S. military unit to do so on Cuban soil, and sent out detachments for outpost duty. Lt. Col. Huntington ordered Company C to occupy a 150-ft tall hill located some distance from the main Marine position, and which could not be supported by the main body at Camp McCalla. Two forward outposts were established, one at a road junction located several hundred yards ahead of the camp and known as the \\"Crossroads\\", and one called \\"The Bridge\\" placed across a road a mile and a half from the American camp, where Spanish forces bringing artillery from Caimanera were expected. With the sea at their backs, a lack of mutual support between outposts, and the thorny scrub and cacti of the arid hills stretching in a dense tangle before them, the Marines had a less-than-ideal tactical position. Commander McCalla pointed out to Lt. Col. Huntington that his outposts were too far forward and could not be seen or supported in the dense undergrowth between the outposts and the main camp. Three of the companies stacked arms and returned to the ship to help with unloading operations. Shortly after sundown, the Marines had their first meal of coffee and hardtack. Soon afterwards the first alarm came. Voices were heard and lights seen in the thicket, but no attack came that night. Spanish forces defending the area were desperately short of food, and delayed attacking until the Marines had completed unloading their stores in hopes of seizing the American supplies. By daybreak, the Marines had completed unloading their stores and equipment, though the artillery pieces and their ammunition were left aboard ship. The remaining companies of the battalion came ashore, and Company C was withdrawn from its isolated hill outpost. The only sound in the thickets was the cooing of mourning doves, a sound which Marines would later learn was a favorite signal call used by Spanish loyalist guerrilla forces. Lt. Col. Huntington was joined in the afternoon by Colonel Laborde of the Cuban army, who for several days had been with Commander McCalla as pilot on Marblehead, and now had been sent ashore to assist the Marines and provide intelligence about the enemy. Laborde reported the major Spanish force in the area had its headquarters at the \\"Well of Cuzco\\", southeast of Fisherman's Point. The well provided the only fresh water in the area. This occupying force of about 500 soldiers and guerrillas, joined by the troops driven from the blockhouse on the bay, constituted the gravest threat to the U.S. base of operations. Laborde noted that seizing Cuzco Well and destroying it would inevitably force Spanish forces to retreat all the way to Ciudad Guant√°namo (Guant√°namo City). As they spoke, firing began in the thicket in front of their position. Lt. Col. Huntington led most of his command forward. However, the thorny tangle of trees, underbrush, and cactus forced him to proceed with only one company. =Battle of Camp McCalla= Gallant defense of Camp McCalla, June 11 Although Huntington was now assured of naval gunfire support, Camp McCalla was tactically unsound. No attack had been expected, so no trenches were dug. The Marines' artillery had not even been sent ashore.Titherington, Richard H., Our War With Spain, Munsey's Magazine, October 1898 ‚Äì March 1899, New York: Frank A. Munsey, Publisher, pp. 907 Located on the sands of the open beach, the Marine campsite proved an ideal target for snipers concealed in the brush. At daybreak (05:00) on Saturday, 11 June, Spanish guerrillas opened fire on the Marines at Camp McCalla from the surrounding brush. Firing a fusillade from their rapid-firing Mauser rifles, the guerrillas advanced towards the camp. After heavy fighting, and supported by the reserve company (Company C) the Marines drove the enemy back into the bush, pursuing the enemy until the chase was abandoned at dark. Two pickets on outpost duty, Privates William Dumphy and James McColgan, who were posted as an early-warning patrol 100 yards ahead of the \\"Crossroads\\" forward outpost were later found dead, shot and cut numerous times in the face and body. Their weapons, shoes, belts, and part of their clothing had been taken. This was the beginning of what Huntington's executive officer, Major Henry Clay Cochrane, later called \\"its 100 hours of fighting\\". At Camp McCalla, the Marines dug in and began firing at the concealed Spaniards, aided by three 3-inch field pieces and two additional 6 mm Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine guns which had been landed on 12 June by the .Venzon, Anne, General Smedley Darlington Butler: Letters of a Leatherneck 1898‚Äì1931, Greenwood Publishing Co, (1992), , p. 8: The landed three 3-inch (75 mm) field pieces and two additional M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine guns on June 12, the latter procured from the ship's own armory. Gunfire from Marblehead passed overhead and impacted in the nearby hills. Wearing large palm leaves tied to their uniforms for camouflage, and firing smokeless powder cartridges, the Spanish forces were difficult to locate as they moved from bush to bush in the dense undergrowth. On the evening of 12 June, enemy forces came within fifty yards of Camp McCalla, and a desperate firefight began.Titherington, Richard H., Our War With Spain, Munsey's Magazine, October 1898 ‚Äì March 1899, New York: Frank A. Munsey, Publisher, pp. 907‚Äì908 Marines responded with their Lee straight- pull rifles, along with machine gun and artillery fire from the Marine 3-inch field pieces. Perhaps deterred by the intense artillery and machine gun fire, the Spanish did not attempt to overrun the camp. Acting Assistant Surgeon John Blair Gibbs and Sergeant Charles H. Smith were both killed in this exchange of fire. Marines later found several blood trails, but no bodies, as the guerrillas removed their wounded and dead to conceal their casualty figures. The next day, the Marines were reinforced by about 60 Cubans under Lieutenant Colonel Enrique Thomas. The Cubans had been equipped with rifles and white duck sailor uniforms by Commander McCalla from the USS Marblehead. Familiar with guerrilla tactics, the Cuban insurgents deployed in pairs in front of the camp, burning the brush and undergrowth as they advanced, thus denying to the enemy of cover. The Marblehead, which had provided shore bombardment on several occasions, steamed down the coast and shelled the well at Cuzco. Nevertheless, the Spanish attack was resumed at dusk, and two more Marines‚Äîacting Sergeant Major Henry Good and Private Goode Taurman‚Äîwere killed. By nightfall on 13 June, the Marines were exhausted. They had not slept nor rested for 100 hours. Relief or reinforcements was impossible, since U.S. Army troops had yet to leave the U.S. The fighting continued for two more days. =Battle of Cuzco Well= Lt Col. Thomas of the Cuban rebel forces advised Colonel Huntington to attack the Spanish garrison at Cuzco Well, consisting of four companies of Spanish infantry and two companies of loyalist guerrilla forces totaling some 500 men.Keene, R.R., This Day in USMC History: June 14, 1898: The Battle For Cuzco Well, Leaatherneck Magazine, Vol. 29 (September 1998) By capturing and destroying the only nearby source of fresh water, it was hoped that the defending Spanish forces would be forced to leave the area. Commander McCalla approved the plans, and the attack was scheduled for 08:00 the next day. Marine companies C and D, about 160 men, under Captain George F. Elliott, a future Commandant of the Marine Corps, joined by the fifty Cubans under Lt. Col. Thomas, would approach Cuzco along the cliffs by the sea. A smaller Marine force would advance by an inland valley, holding a picket line for the main force, with men in reserve to assist if necessary. The gunboat was assigned to support the attack from sea. The day was already hot when the combined U.S.-Cuban force began its march on 14 June. Colonel Laborde guided the main force, and a Cuban scout named Polycarpio guided a smaller force led by 2nd Lt. Magill. The march was slowed by rough terrain, vicious undergrowth, and increasing heat; at one point, the captains of Companies C and D in the main column had fallen behind owing to heat exhaustion. It was almost 11:00 when the main force reached the steep, horse- shoe shaped hill around Cuzco valley; the commanders of Companies C and D rejoined their units fifteen minutes later. About the same time, the Cubans, who were marching ahead of the Marine companies, were spotted by the enemy. A race for the crest of the hill began. The Marines and the Cubans reached the summit first, under heavy fire from the Spanish and guerrillas. The smaller Marine force approached on the double, using their 6 mm (0.236-inch) Lee rifles to pour a deadly crossfire on the enemy flank. Three of the four M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine guns accompanying the Marines were used by Company C in the fighting.Sumrall, Al, The Colt Model 1895 Automatic Machine Gun According to Pvt. John Clifford of Company D, the machine guns were instrumental in supporting the Marine assault.Clifford, John H., History of The First Battalion of US Marines (1930), Box 15, Cochrane Collection (PC# 1), Marine Corps Historical Center (MCHC), Washington, D.C.. This was the first known tactical use of machine gun fire for mobile fire support in offensive combat. The light weight of the Marines' new 6mm Lee cartridgeSage, William H. (Maj.), and Clark, H.C.

(Commander) et al, Annual Report to the Secretary of the Navy: Report of Naval Small Arms Board, May 15, 1895, Washington, D.C.: United States Navy Dept. (1895), p. 309: The basic combat ammunition load of an 1898 naval bluejacket or marine was 160 rounds of 6mm ammunition, carried in four lightweight cartridge boxes attached to the belt. Outfitted in this manner, a marine could carry 60‚Äì100% more rifle ammunition on his person than the typical Army trooper.Keeler, Frank, p. 16: \\"We were ordered to fill our belts and canteens...\\" Midway through the battle, the Cuban rebel forces ran out of 6 mm cartridges, and were resupplied with an additional six clips (30 cartridges) from the belts of individual Marines, yet none of the Americans ran short of ammunition, despite firing some sixty shots apiece in the battle.Keeler, Frank and Tyson, Carolyn A. (ed.), The Journal of Frank Keeler, 1898: Report of Captain G.F. Elliott, (ed., with Appendix) Washington, D.C.: Marine Corps Letters Series, No. 1, Training and Education Command, (1967), p. 46 During this portion of the fighting, Captain Elliott had requested that Dolphin provide fire support to the Marines by shelling the Spanish blockhouse and nearby positions with her naval guns. Through a miscommunication of signals, however, the gunboat began unknowingly dropping shells in the direct path of a small force of fifty marines and ten Cuban irregulars led by 2nd Lt. Magill, who was attempting to flank the Spanish position and potentially cut off any avenue of retreat. Affixing his handkerchief to a long stick and braving the Spanish fire, Sergeant John H. Quick took up an exposed position on the ridge to immediately wigwag a flag signal to Dolphin to adjust her gunfire. War Correspondent Stephen Crane, who had accompanied the Marines, later described the scene in his war tale \\"Marines Signaling Under Fire at Guantanamo\\": > \\"Sergeant Quick arose, and announced that he was a signalman. He produced > from somewhere a blue polka-dot neckerchief as large as a quilt. He tied it > on a long, crooked stick. Then he went to the top of the ridge, and turning > his back to the Spanish fire, began to signal to the Dolphin. Again we gave > a man sole possession of a particular part of the ridge. We didn't want it. > He could have it and welcome. If the young sergeant had had the smallpox, > the cholera, and the yellow fever, we could not have slid out with more > celerity. > As men have said often, it seemed as if there was in this war a God of > Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans.

As he swung his clumsy flag to > and fro, an end of it once caught on a cactus pillar, and he looked sharply > over his shoulder to see what had it. He gave the flag an impatient jerk. He > looked annoyed.\\" When Sergeant Quick finished this message, the ship answered. Quick then picked up his Lee rifle and resumed his place on the firing line. For his gallant and selfless conduct during this action, Quick would later receive the Medal of Honor. Dolphin shifted her fire onto the enemy camp and blockhouse, and by 14:00, the Spanish had broken and fled the blockhouse. Unfortunately, 2nd Lt. Magill's men were delayed sufficiently to prevent them from cutting off a Spanish retreat, though his men did capture the Spanish signaling station and its heliograph equipment. As the Spanish forces withdrew through a gully on the other side of the valley, Marines opened fire at a distance of 1,200 yards, firing volley after volley. The Spanish were unable to accurately return fire, allowing Marine Company B and the Cuban rebels to close the distance, firing as they advanced. The Spanish first attempted to concentrate their fires on the Cubans and managed to kill two of them, but were forced back by marine rifle fire once again, at which point the remaining enemy, which up to that point had been withdrawing in good order, broke and scattered. =Spanish retreat= By 15:30, the enemy had abandoned the battlefield, and all firing had ceased. Most of the Spanish had escaped, but a lieutenant and 17 enlisted men were captured, and the enemy suffered casualties of 60 killed and 150 wounded. They had left behind 30 modern 7mm Mauser rifles and ammunition. Two Marines and two Cuban rebels had been wounded, and two Cuban rebels killed, who were buried where they fell. The most serious casualties suffered by the Marines were from heat exhaustion, which disabled one officer and 22 men. Gunboat Dolphin took these aboard after the fighting was over for the trip back to Camp McCalla. The Spanish headquarters building (blockhouse) was burned, and the freshwater well at Cuzco was destroyed, thus ending its immediate usefulness, including to the Marines, whose officers would not let them drink from it prior to its destruction. Water was eventually brought up from the USS Dolphin after a wait of two hours. Spanish forces retreated in small groups of stragglers to Guant√°namo, via Cayo del Toro and Caimanera. Apparently expecting the U.S. forces to follow up the victory, they fortified Dos Caminos, a small settlement at the crossing of two roads, and added several blockhouses to the number already erected on the rail line. The Spanish soldiers were apparently impressed by marine firepower; upon arrival at Ciudad Guant√°namo (Guant√°namo City), the surviving members of the Cuzco Well garrison informed General Pareja that they had been attacked by 10,000 Americans.Reynolds, Bradley M., New Aspects of Naval History: Selected Papers From the 5th Naval History Symposium, U.S. Naval Academy, Nautical and Aviation Publishing Co. of America, , (1985), p. 147 Camp McCalla saw no further attacks by Spanish or guerilla forces, and was disestablished on August 5, 1898. Meanwhile, attention was soon focused on other areas of the bay. The Spanish were adding to their earthworks on Cayo del Toro, where they had three bronze guns and a modern Krupp gun. At Caimanera, on the bluff south of the village, were mounted three more of the guns, and the small gunboat Sandoval had a battery of one six-pounder and an automatic one-pounder Maxim gun. Aftermath =Bombardment of Fort Toro= Admiral Sampson decided to shell the fort of Cayo del Toro, and on 16 June he sent USS Texas and Yankee to join with USS Marblehead in this plan. Fire from the three ships temporarily dismounted two of the enemy's big guns, destroyed the buildings on the Cay, and drove the troops from all guns and trenches. Their combined firepower had reduced the Spanish fort to impotency within 15 minutes of initially engaging it. One enemy shell landed near the bow of the Marblehead, sinking within ten yards of the ship, but no hits were scored. As the Americans proceeded slowly, a lookout on Marblehead reported that the starboard propeller was foul of a buoy. The engine was stopped, and the propeller was cleared of the \\"buoy\\", which turned out to be a contact mine. The mine was successfully disarmed. Afterward, it was learned that the ships had passed through a field of 18 such mines, or torpedoes, on the trip up the bay and through the same field on the return trip, without injury of any kind. A few days after the attack on Cayo del Toro, the mine field was thoroughly explored, and 14 mines were recovered. Their failure to explode on contact was attributed to mechanical faults, plus a healthy growth of barnacles on the contact levers. The minesweeping operation, carried out without specialized equipment, involved two steam launches and two whaleboats from Marblehead and Dolphin. A launch and whaleboat side by side, connected to the other launch and whaleboat by a rope with a chain drag in the center, swept the channel. When the drag met an obstruction, the boats came together and crossed the ends of the drag. The boats were then hauled carefully up to the mine, which was brought to the surface and disarmed. Twice the drag brought up two mines together. While sweeping for mines, the boats had been fired on from Hicacal Beach, where 250 Spanish infantry were posted to guard the mine field. It was determined to rout the last enemy force remaining in the vicinity of the bay, and on 25 June Lt. Col. Huntington led two companies of Marines and 40 Cubans in an amphibious assault on Hicacal Beach. It proved to be a bloodless encounter, since the Spanish had left a day or two earlier. =Santiago= With Guant√°namo Bay successfully occupied, US interest centered on operations at Santiago. An American expeditionary force of 17,000 officers and men under Major General William R. Shafter was landed east of the city at the small ports of Daiquir√≠ and Siboney between 22 and 25 June, without opposition. A week later, on 1 July, the historic battles of El Caney and San Juan Hill ended in victory for U.S. forces, opening up the approaches to Santiago itself. On the morning of 3 July, a demand was sent to the Spanish commander, General Arsenio Linares, to surrender or suffer bombardment of the city as an alternative. On the same morning, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera sallied forth from Santiago Bay, only to meet with complete destruction at the hands of the U.S. fleet. Major Spanish resistance at Santiago was at an end, although it was not until 15 July that a preliminary agreement was signed. U.S. forces occupied the city on 17 July. The 7,000 Spanish troops at the city of Guant√°namo ‚Äì only away ‚Äì did not march to the aid of Linares' besieged army, because prior to the cutting of his communications, General Pareja had been directed by his superiors to hold the city of Guant√°namo at all costs. This was so ordered because the Spanish feared that the Guant√°namo valley might be used as an invasion route by U.S. forces, as the English had once used it to advance on Santiago. After the Navy cut the cables and established a base at Guant√°namo Bay, General Pareja remained in complete ignorance concerning the course of the war because the Cuban insurgents maintained such a tight ring about the city that not one messenger got through their lines. Fifteen were caught and executed as spies. None of General Linares' frantic requests for aid reached Pareja. The threat posed by U.S. Naval forces and a battalion of Marines at Guant√°namo Bay, plus the stranglehold on land communications by 1,000 Cuban insurgents, effectively pinned down an army of 7,000 men which might have changed the outcome of the fighting at Santiago. Less than a week after the surrender of Santiago, the base at Guant√°namo Bay was used to launch the invasion of Puerto Rico, to the east. Three thousand five hundred troops under General Miles sailed from the Bay on 21 July. This was the last important event in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War phase of Guant√°namo Bay; on August 12, the war ended with the signing of the peace protocol and an armistice. The new U.S. Naval Base was not formalized by lease agreement between the U.S. and Cuba until five years later, when in 1903 it was acquired as a \\"coaling and Naval station\\", but its worth was already proven. Lt. Col. Huntington's Marine First Battalion, which had reembarked aboard the during the siege and surrender of Santiago, sailed for the United States, and after a stop at New York, arrived at Portsmouth Harbor, disembarking her marines on the evening of 24 August 1898.

Interior of Amboy Crater from near breach showing lava lakes. Amboy Crater is an extinct cinder cone volcano that rises above a lava field in the eastern Mojave Desert of southern California, within Mojave Trails National Monument. It is about equidistant from Barstow to the west and Needles to the east, and south of historic U.S. Route 66, near the town of Amboy in San Bernardino County. In 1973, Amboy Crater was designated the Amboy Crater National Natural Landmark. Amboy Crater at dusk Location The crater's location is southwest of the town of Amboy and the Route 66-National Trails Highway. The Bullion Mountains are to the west, and the Bristol Mountains to the northeast. Description This cinder cone is estimated to be 79,000 years old (+/- 5,000 years)http://alliance.la.asu.edu/rockart/vmltest/PhillipsMojaveTest.pdf . accessed 3/25/2013 and was formed in layers of mostly vesicular pahoehoe during the Pleistocene geological period. The interior has a lava lake. Lava flows as old as Amboy Crater itself blanket the surrounding area. The most recent eruption was approximately 10,000 years ago. The crater is above sea level, about above the surrounding basalt lava plains. The scenic and solitary Amboy Crater was a popular sight and stop for travelers on U.S. Route 66 in California before the opening of Interstate 40 in 1973. Other than a stretch of U.S. Route 66 in New Mexico, Amboy Crater is one of just a few extinct volcanoes along the entire route, so generations of U.S. Route 66 travelers from the 1920s through the 1960s could boast that they had climbed a real volcano. Visits decreased after Interstate 40 opened, but have increased in recent years with the nearby Mitchell Caverns, Mojave National Preserve, and renewed historical tourism interest in \\"old Route 66\\". Visiting The Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) recommends using the Western Cone Trail to reach the volcano peak's rim, a steep and rocky hiking trail. The trailhead is at the Amboy Crater day-use parking area, which provides shaded and open picnic tables and public restrooms. Regular desert precautions apply here: being alert for rattlesnakes and old military explosives, and having a hat, sunscreen, sturdy shoes, and abundant drinking water. Educational and organized groups are advised to contact the BLM before heading out to Amboy Crater.BLM Needles Field Office: telephone number - 1 760 326 7000 (to ensure adequate group parking availability) Media Amboy Crater was used as a location in the 1959 movie Journey to the Center of the Earth.

Trees in this genus are commonly known as the stone oaks and differ from Quercus primarily because they produce insect-pollinated flowers on erect spikes and the female flowers have short styles with punctate stigmas. The World Checklist (see link below) accepts 334 species, all restricted to Southeast Asia. Fossils show that Lithocarpus formerly had a wider distribution, being found in North America and Europe during the Eocene to Miocene epochs. These trees do not tolerate freezing temperatures, because all species are evergreen and none are found in temperate zones, despite the lack of any geographic barrier to dispersal in the subtropical zone of East Asia. They extend from the foothills of the Hengduan mountains, where they form dominant stands of trees, through Indochina and the Malayan Archipelago, crossing Wallace's Line and reaching Papua. In general, these trees are most dominant in the uplands (>1000m a.s.l.) and have many ecological similarities to the Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant lowland tree group. These trees are also obviously intolerant of seasonal droughts, not being found on the Lesser Sunda islands, despite their ability to cross numerous water barriers to reach Papua. The North American tanoak or tanbark oak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus) was previously included in this genus but recent evidence indicates the similarities in flower and fruit morphology are due to convergent evolution. Both genetic and morphological evidence demonstrate that the tanoak is a distant relative to Asian stone oaks and, therefore tanoak has been moved into a new genus, Notholithocarpus. Lithocarpus trees are evergreen trees with leathery, alternate leaves, the margins of which are almost always entire, rarely toothed. The seed is a nut similar to an oak acorn with a cupule enclosing the basal part of the fruit. Cupules of stone oaks demonstrate a much wider variety in the type and arrangement of lamellae and scales on the outside of the cupule, with some of them completely enclosing the nut, even becoming irregularly dehiscent in a few species. The seeds are often protected by a hard woody shell (hence the genus name, from Greek lithos, stone, + carpos, seed). In some sections of the genus, the seed is embedded in the basal material of the fruit which becomes highly lignified and hard, lending greater mechanical protection to the seed, creating a novel type of fruit. The kernel is edible in some species (e.g. Lithocarpus edulis), but inedible, and very bitter, in others. Several of the species are very attractive ornamental trees, used in parks and large gardens in warm temperate and subtropical areas. Classification In 1948, Aimee Camus produced a comprehensive treatment of the two major genera in the family, given the specimens available to her at the Natural History Museum in Paris. Because of the many collections available from the French colonies in subtropical and tropical Indochina, she worked extensively with stone oaks from the region. Most importantly, she provided the only existing infrageneric structure within the genus but unfortunately, many of the species from the Malesian region, south of the Isthmus of Kra, are not incorporated into this system. Her classification system included 13 subgenera, including the subgenus Pasania which is by far the largest division within the genus. About 100 Asian species were treated separately in Pasania, at the genus level, and occasionally the old name persists on some herbarium sheets that have not been annotated. Several of the other subgenera possess fewer than ten species and have distinctive morphologies. Few of the Malesian species are treated in Camus' system and Soepadmo, who wrote the Flora Malesiana treatment, made no attempt to update or integrate these species into Camus' system, therefore a lot of work obviously remains to be done. Camus' system was highly detailed, as three levels of organization are recognized below the subgenus, but the classification is not systematic at the lowest level. List of subgenera (No. of species in Camus' treatment): Castanicarpus (1); Corylopasania (2); Cryptostylis (1); Cyclobalanus (58); Cyrtobalanus (1); Eulithocarpus (11); Gymnobalanus (10); Liebmannia (3); Oerstedia (1); Pachybalanus (14); Pasania (209); Pseudosynaedrys (9); Synaedrys (15); indeterminate (12). Early researchers into the family often suggested that the stone oaks were primitive in the family. An exhaustive study of the inflorescence and fruits of 73 species from eight of Camus' subgenera found that important development and evolutionary characters distinguish the major groups in the genus and indicate differences among the genera of the family.

Most of it occurs in the southeastern part of the island in the provinces of Guant√°namo and Santiago de Cuba. The ecoregion receives less than of rainfall annually. The principal soils are coastal rendzinas that were derived from coralline limestone. Cuban cactus scrub contains four vegetation zones: xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland, coastal thorny semidesert, coastal sclerophyllous scrubland, and rocky coastal scrublands. Xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland Vegetation in the xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrublands reaches a height of and is dominated by palms and succulents, especially cacti. Common evergreen plants include (Bourreria virgata), (Capparis cynophallophora), (Eugenia foetida), Bursera glauca, B. cubana, Croton spp., Cordia spp., Calliandra colletioides, Caesalpinia spp., Acacia spp., Phyllostylon brasiliense, Pseudosamanea cubana and (Guaiacum officinale). (Opuntia stricta), O. militaris, (Harrisia eriophora), (H. taetra), (Pilosocereus polygonus), (Dendrocereus nudiflorus), (Agave spp.), (Melocactus spp.) and Leptocereus spp. are typical succulents. Coastal thorny semidesert Coastal thorny semidesert is similar to xerophytic coastal and subcoastal scrubland in that they both have the same succulent composition and reach a height of . However, succulents represent a smaller proportion of the plant life in this zone. Other plant species include (Cordia sebestena), (Hippomane mancinella) and (Plumeria filifolia). Coastal sclerophyllous scrubland The vegetation in this zone is sclerophyllous, meaning that their leaves are hard. It reaches a height of with emergent trees up to . This zone represents the transition between xeric shrublands and moister dry forests. Plant life includes (Picrodendron baccatum), (Maytenus buxifolia), (Pictetia spinosa), (Brya ebenus) and (Diospyros grisebachii). Rocky coastal scrublands The most sparse and stunted vegetation is found in this zone, which occurs adjacent to the ocean on karstic soil.

He played for several clubs, most notably for Wolverhampton Wanderers and Liverpool.  Life and playing career  Born in Colwyn Bay, Conwy, North Wales, Sidlow played for Llandudno, Colwyn Bay and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Signed by Wolves in 1937 by the great Major Frank Buckley Sidlow was the first choice Wolves keeper both before the war. The rise of England great Bert Williams at Wolves after the war limited his chances, this included a notable international match between England and Wales at Ninian Park where Wolves supplied both the England Keeper (Williams) and Welsh keeper (Sidlow). With Wolves having two international keepers this led to Sidlow being surplus to requirements, but a recognised international, Liverpool manager George Kay signed him for a then record ¬£4000 in February 1946. Sidlow made his debut for Liverpool on 31 August 1946 in a league match at Bramall Lane, and kept his first clean sheet for the club, with Len Carney scoring a late goal for the Reds in the 90th minute. Sidlow's career was curtailed because of the Second World War which began when he was approaching his 24th birthday, having taken away the best years of his career he was almost 31 when he signed for the Reds. Sidlow with Charlie Ashcroft and Ray Minshull were the goalkeepers vying for the number one jersey at Anfield for the 1946/47 season; the first competitive season following the war. Even with the competition, Sidlow was given the position, which he held for 34 of the 42 games in a season that saw Liverpool win their first championship for 24 years. Much of which is owed to Sidlow as the final game of the season was a must win for the Reds. Sidlow's former employers Wolves needed just a point to win the title and Liverpool had to face them at Molineux. the Reds were a point back on their hosts and, needed a victory to win the league title. After a comprehensive 5‚Äì0 win at Anfield, Wolves were favourites to win the game and take the title, but goals from Jack Balmer and Albert Stubbins, plus Sidlow and the backline keeping Wolves down to one meant the Championship trophy would be heading to Merseyside. Sidlow tasted disappointment with the Reds too when they reached their first Wembley final in 1950, Arsenal where the opposition who took the FA Cup back to Highbury after a 2‚Äì0 win. Sidlow's Liverpool days were drawn to a close during the 1950/51 after he originally begun the season as first choice. Charlie Ahcroft and Russell Crossley took over for four games before Sidlow came back in to play his last match for the club, Anfield was the place and Newcastle United were the visitors. Things didn't go well for Sidlow and the Reds as The Magpies went back to St James' Park with the points after a 4‚Äì2 win. Crossley came back in to the side and Cyril retired in the August 1952, upon retirement from the top level, he went on to play for New Brighton. Cyril earned seven caps for Wales during his career.

It was administered by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee (Comit√™ Gestor da Internet no Brasil) until 2005 when it started being administered by Brazilian Network Information Center (N√∫cleo de Informa√ß√£o e Coordena√ß√£o do Ponto br). A local contact is required for any registration. Registrations of domain names with Portuguese characters are also accepted. With the exception of universities, the second-level domain is fixed and selected from a list that defines the category. For example, is in the art (music, folklore etc.) category, and is in the non-governmental organization category. Institutions of tertiary education were allowed to use the ccSLD , although some use and others (mainly public universities) use . There are also some other few exceptions that were allowed to use the second level domain until the end of 2000. As of April 2010, most domain registrations ignore categories and register in the domain, which has over 90% of all registered domains. The (Judiciary), and (banks) domains have mandatory DNSSEC use.  History  Created and delegated to Brazil in 1989IANA - Informa√ß√µes sobre a delega√ß√£o do .br by Jon Postel,NIC.br - CGI.br comemora os 20 anos do \\".br\\" initially the domain was operated manually by Registro.br and administered by the Funda√ß√£o de Amparo √† Pesquisa do Estado de S√£o Paulo (FAPESP). Originally, only researchers and institutions to which they belonged had the interest and ability to adopt the new system and register domains under .br. At the time, networks prevalent in the Brazilian academic setting were the BITNET (\\"Because It's Time NETwork\\"), the HEPnet (\\"High Energy Physics Network\\") and the UUCP (\\"Unix-to-Unix Copy Program\\"). As such, even before Brazil officially connected to the Internet in 1991, the .br domain was used to identify the machines participating in networks already in use by academics. In 1995 the Comit√™ Gestor da Internet no Brasil \\"Internet Management Committee of Brazil\\" (CGI.br) was created with an objective to coordinate the allocation of Internet addresses (IPs) and the registration of .br domain names. There were 851 domains registered with the Brazilian DNS (Domain Name System\\") by the beginning of 1996, thereafter experiencing rapid growth with the mass arrival of companies, Internet providers and media onto the Internet. The registration system was automated in 1997 and was developed using open source software. In 2005, CGI.br created his own executive arm, the N√∫cleo de Informa√ß√£o e Coordena√ß√£o do Ponto BR' \\"The Center for Information and Coordination of Dot BR\\" (NIC.br),CGI.br - Comunicado ao P√∫blico which currently serves in both administrative and operational capacity for the registry. In 2017, accounts associated with DNS records of Brazilian banks were hacked. Kaspersky's researchers pointed out to a vulnerability in NIC.br's website and suggested its infrastructure had been compromised. NIC's director at the time, Frederico Neves, denied that NIC.br was \\"hacked\\", although NIC admitted the vulnerability.  Domain registry  To register any domains under .br, it is necessary to enter into contact with Registro.br. Entities legally established in Brazil as a company (\\"pessoa jur√≠dica\\") or a physical person (\\"profissional liberal\\" and \\"pessoas f√≠sicas\\") that has a contact within Brazil can register domains. Foreign companies that have a power-of-attorney legally established in Brazil can also do it by following specific rules. The registration of domains with special Portuguese characters (√†, √°, √¢, √£, √©, √™, √≠, √≥, √¥, √µ, √∫, √º and √ß) is accepted since 2005.Registro.br - Tips and Rules = Syntactic rules for .br domains = * Minimum of 2 and maximum of 26 characters, not including the category. For example, in the field XXXX.COM.BR, this limitation relates to the XXXX. * Valid characters are [A-Z, 0-9], the hyphen, and the following accented characters: √†, √°, √¢, √£, √©, √™, √≠, √≥, √¥, √µ, √∫, √º, √ß. * Domains cannot contain only numbers. * To maintain the integrity of the registry, Registro.br sets up an equivalence mapping to compare domain names with and without accented characters. The mapping is done by converting accented characters and the cedilla for their non-accented versions and \\"c\\", respectively, and discards hyphens. A new domain will only be allowed to be registered when there is no equivalent to a pre-existing domain, or when the applicant is the same entity that owns the domain equivalent. :Note: Specifically for the domain .NOM.BR, it is necessary to choose two names, i.e.: NAME1.NAME2.NOM.BR.  Usage statistics  .br is the most common Portuguese language Web site suffix,As of February 18, 2010, Google showed 530.000.000 pages for site: .br, 95.100.000 for site: .pt (Portugal) and 553.000 for site: .ao (Angola).

The BY code originates from the ISO code for Byelorussia, the former name of the country. The ccTLD was created for Belarus on 10 May 1994.  Eligibility  The Operations and Analysis Centre under the President of the Republic of Belarus allows for anyone (not only for those who resides in Belarus) to register a second level domain such as something.by. However, third-level domains .gov.by and .mil.by are reserved for government use only. The names chosen for second-level domains must not conflict with those already registered or with well-known brand names. The names also must have two or more Latin characters and they cannot either start or finish with a hyphen (-). Second-level names that might have words or phrases that are deemed to be vulgar or illegal can also be rejected by the Administrator of ccTLD BY.  History  At the very beginning there was only one company in Belarus which carried out the registration of domains .by ‚Äì Open Contact Ltd. In October 2006 two other Belarusian companies got the licence to provide technical protection of information, including its execution by cryptographic means, and comprising the usage of a digital signature. Those were Reliable Software Inc. and Business Network JV. The former one has started to receive inquiries and carry out domain registration since 27 March 2007. On 3 September 2007 the licence was granted also to Extmedia and on 29 June - to Active Technologies. At present each of the five companies carries out domain registration officially. Since 1994 the only Technical Administrator of the .by domain has been Open Contact Ltd. According to the results of the competition conducted in September 2010 by the Operations and Analysis Centre (OAC) - the authorised government body for the purposes of security of the Internet - the .by domain was redelegated to Reliable Software Inc. (hoster.by).IANA, Redelegation of the .BY domain representing Belarus to Reliable Software Inc. On 7 February 2012 ICANN approved the candidacy of the company unequivocally. In 2007 while Open Contact Ltd. was the Technical Administrator of the .by domain it announced the reduction of price on national domains from 190,000 Belarusian rubles (US$88) to 130,000 ($60). This measure triggered the process of transmission of Belarusian web-sites from generic top-level domains to the national one. Since 2012, when Reliable Software Inc. (hoster.by) became the Technical Administrator of the .by domain, several changes have been adopted: the assessment of inquiries in the Operations and Analysis Centre (OAC) and a free 30-day reservation of a domain name have been eliminated and WHOIS- service has started to work.  Fees  Since 2011 due to changes in currency exchange rate the price has decreased. The costs to use a .by domain is a US$12 fee for the first year and second payment of $12 to maintain the domain. The renewal of the domain occurs yearly. The maximum upfront payment is 1 years. The payment of the fees occur by bank transfer, WebMoney, credit card or cash depending on the registrar.  Internationalized country code top- level domain  Belarus applied for the Cyrillic top-level domain .–±–µ–ª, intended to be used with subdomains in the same script, which was approved by the ICANN in 2015.  Other uses  The .by code is used for domain hack by institutions from the German state of Bavaria (German: Bayern), such as bayern.by, the Bavarian Tourism Agency. Since \\"\\" means \\"town\\" or \\"city\\" in Norwegian, it's also used by some newspapers, such as osl.by for an Oslo newspaper, and trd.by for a Trondheim newspaper.

They are currently members of the and play at the Sir Tom Finney Stadium. The club is now fully owned by a community organisation that represents supporters of the club.Supporters Direct Case Study: Bamber Bridge Supporters Direct History A Bamber Bridge club played in the late 19th century, but the modern club was established in 1952.Club History Bamber Bridge F.C. The new club joined the Preston & District League, progressing to the Senior Division. In 1974 they merged with Walton-le-Dale, continuing in the Preston & District League. They went on to win the league's Guildhall Cup in 1978‚Äì79, before completing a Premier Division and cup double in 1980‚Äì81. After winning the Lancashire FA Amateur Shield in 1981‚Äì82 and another Guildhall Cup win in 1984‚Äì85, they won back-to-back Premier Division titles in the next two seasons, before winning a league and cup double in 1989‚Äì90.Club honours Bamber Bridge F.C. In 1990 Bamber Bridge moved up to Division Two of the North West Counties League. Their second season in the league saw them win the division, resulting in promotion to Division One; they also reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase, where they lost 2‚Äì0 to Wimborne Town. After finishing as runners-up in Division One in the following season (1992‚Äì93), a second successive promotion was achieved when the club moved up to Division One of the Northern Premier League. In 1994‚Äì95, a second-place finish saw Bamber Bridge promoted to the Premier Division, with the club also winning the league's Challenge Cup in their first season in the league and victory in the final of the Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy. The following season they won the Premier Division, which would have usually resulted in promotion to the Football Conference. However, Irongate was not deemed up to standard for the fifth tier, and the club remained in the Northern Premier League, In 1999‚Äì2000 Bamber Bridge reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. After beating St Albans City 2‚Äì0, they lost 1‚Äì0 at Cambridge United in the second round. The club remained in the Premier Division until the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, in which they finished bottom; although they beat Radcliffe Borough 3‚Äì2 in the promotion/relegation play-off semi-final, they were beaten 2‚Äì1 by Ashton United in the final. Although Bamber Bridge returned to the Premier Division as a result of league restructuring following the creation of the Conference North and South, their stay was short-lived as they were relegated to Division One at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season. However, the season did see them win the President's Cup. When the league added a third division in 2007, the club were placed in Division One North. A fourth-place finish in 2013‚Äì14 saw Bamber Bridge qualify for the promotion play-offs. After beating Warrington Town 1‚Äì0 in the semi-finals, they lost 3‚Äì2 to Ramsbottom United in the final. In the following season they finished third, again qualifying for the play-offs, this time losing 2‚Äì0 to Darlington 1883 in the final after beating Northwich Victoria 2‚Äì1 in the semi-final. A fourth-place finish in 2017‚Äì18 saw the club reach the play-offs, in which they defeated Tadcaster Albion 2‚Äì1 in the semi-finals and Prescot Cables 1‚Äì0 in the final to earn promotion to the Premier Division. Ground Following the 1974 merger, the club played at the King George's Playing Field. In 1983 they purchased a plot of derelict land to build their own ground, with the name Irongate taken from the local area. The first game was played in August 1987.History Bamber Bridge F.C. The ground was officially named the Sir Tom Finney Stadium after Finney's death in 2014.Brig stadium to be named after Sir Tom Chorley Guardian, 8 April 2014 It currently has a capacity of 3,000, of which 554 is seated and 800 covered.

International variations =Australia= In Australia, the Master of Engineering degree is a research degree requiring completion of a thesis. Like the Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.), it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Science, Master of Engineering Studies or Master of Professional Engineering which are coursework master's degrees. Exceptions are Monash University which awards a Master of Engineering Science by either research or coursework, the University of Melbourne which offers a Master of Engineering by coursework, and the University of Tasmania which offer a Master of Engineering Science by research.University of Tasmania Engineering Course Guide Accessed 16 September 2009 The University of Melbourne accepted the first intake of Master of Engineering students in February 2010. The coursework Master of Engineering is offered in 11 specialisations and accepts graduates with three-year degrees in Science and Maths. The entry requirement is completion of a bachelor's degree at or above the second class honours level. Some universities do not offer direct enrolment into Doctor of Philosophy degree and students must first enrol in a lesser research degree before \\"upgrading\\". =Brazil= In Brazil, the rough equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree of typically two years' length. It involves mostly coursework and a thesis or research paper in applied engineering. Another variant is the Academic Masters, which is equivalent to a Master's of Science. Such degree is tied to more extensive research and is usually the choice of those who wish to continue on a doctoral course or work in academia. =Canada= In Canada, the Master of Engineering degree is a graduate degree of typically two years length that involves coursework and a thesis or research paper of significant depth. Some Canadian universities offer a Master of Engineering or either a Master of Science or Master of Applied Science in engineering or both. =Colombia= In Colombia, the Master of Engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of five years. Depending upon the emphasis is called Ms.Eng. with emphasis in Energy, Chemistry, Environment and so on. At the end, it is required to make a publication of the developed work in a recognized journal of scientific spreading as a requirement for the degree. =Croatia= Introduced with the Bologna process, the Croatian Master of Engineering is typically a two-year program and a direct continuation of a three-year Bachelor course. The degree is abbreviated mag. ing. and followed by the field of study (for example: mag. ing. raƒçunarstva ‚Äì Master of Computer Engineering) =Denmark= From a Danish university, a Master of Engineering is called cand.polyt (lat.: candidatus polytechnices). It is a two-year add-on to either an academic 3-year Bachelor in Engineering or a practical 3.5-year Profession Bachelor of Engineering. The title is achievable from the following universities: the Technical University of Denmark, Aarhus University, Aalborg University, and the University of Southern Denmark. =Finland= There are two distinct degrees in Finland, a taught university degree (diplomi-insin√∂√∂ri) and a polytechnic master's degree's (insin√∂√∂ri (ylempi AMK)).Finnish legislation 423/2005 on degrees at Universities of Applied Sciences Accessed: 21 June 2009 While the former is translated as \\"Master of Science in Technology\\", the term \\"Master of Engineering\\" is predominantly used by Universities of Applied Sciences, which offer master's degree programs to holders of polytechnic bachelor's degrees (insin√∂√∂ri (amk)). As European Bologna process directs, in order to get an M.Eng. degree, B.Sc. engineers have to additionally study full-time one or two years and finalize a Master's thesis. Most of the M.Eng. degree programs are taught in Finnish, but some Swedish and English language programs also exist.Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Master's degrees Accessed: 21 June 2009 =France= In France, three diploma exist for 5 years of study in the field of engineering: the Master's diploma in engineering (dipl√¥me de master en sciences de l'ing√©nieur) which is usually delivered by universities; the CMI for Cursus Master en Ing√©nierie (Comprehensive Master of Engineering), which is a selective master for a specific speciality with more courses than a normal master's diploma in engineering, that is delivered by universities selected by the label \\"R√©seau figure\\" ; and the engineer's degree (\\"dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur\\") which can only be delivered by some Engineering schools called grandes √©coles‚Äîvery selective schools that are generally smaller than universities‚Äîand provides \\"a level of education comparable to a master's degree in engineering in the United States\\" (AACRAO). The engineer's degree usually prepare students for professional careers. Courses always include management, economy or more generally transverse courses. Training periods in industry or in laboratories are also required. The Master's diploma in engineering offers a more focused approach on a field of engineering, and the Comprehensive Master of Engineering is the elitist Master's program. A Ph.D. program can be joined by acquiring anyone of those three diplomas. =Germany= In Germany, the local engineer's degrees (Diplomingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university and Dipl.-Ing. (FH), the engineering degree offered by Fachhochschulen after 4 years of study) were abolished in most universities in 2010 and were replaced by postgraduate master's degrees (M.Sc. and M.Eng.). The first Master of Engineering courses were introduced in Germany in 2000 as result of the Bologna process. This type of master's degree is offered by German universities and Fachhochschulen (Universities of Applied Sciences) alike and is typically a two-year program with application-oriented coursework and an applied research thesis. The entry requirement is the successful completion of a bachelor's degree or an equivalent from before the Bologna process, with good marks. The nine leading German technical universities (Group of TU9) prefer awarding the Master of Science degree for completing engineering studies in a master's program.https://www.tu9.de/graduate/master.php =India= In India, a Master of Engineering (M.E.) or a Master of Technology (M.Tech.) or a Master of Science in Engineering (MSc.Engg.) degree is a postgraduate program in engineering field. It is generally a 2-year program (2 or more years in case of MSc.Engg.) after completing a 4-year undergraduate degree in engineering (Bachelor of Engineering - B.E. or Bachelor of Technology - B.Tech.). Integrated M.E./M.Tech. degree (B.E./B.Tech. + M.E./M.Tech.) program of 5-year duration is also offered by many institutions. A Master of Science in Engineering (MSc.Engg.) is usually structured as a research master's degree, lesser than a PhD and considered to be parallel to an M.Phil. in humanities and science. =Italy= In Italy, the local engineer's degrees (Laurea in Ingegneria), a first degree after 5 years of study at a university were abolished in most universities in 2008. The equivalent of a Master of Engineering degree is a professional master's degree (Laurea Magistrale) of two years length that involves mostly coursework and a thesis paper in applied engineering. Entry requirements to a Master of Engineering degree include a 3-year bachelor engineering degree (Laurea). =New Zealand= In New Zealand, the Master of Engineering degree is generally a research based degree requiring completion of a thesis in key universities (University of Auckland, University of Canterbury, etc.).http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/future-students/qualifications-and- courses/masters-degrees/master-of-engineering/ Similar to the UK's Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) in engineering or technology, it is considered a lesser degree than Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and a higher degree than a coursework master. It is not to be confused with Master of Engineering Studies which is coursework master's degree. In Auckland University of Technology (AUT), this degree can be achieved either by completing a thesis (research pathway) or a combination of coursework and research project (coursework pathway).http://www.aut.ac.nz/study-at-aut/study- areas/engineering/postgraduate/master-of-engineering/ =Nepal= In Nepal, a Master of Engineering (M.E.) or a Master of Technology (M.Tech.) degree is a postgraduate program in engineering. This is generally a 2-year specialization program in a specific branch of engineering field. Students typically enter the M.E./M.Tech. program after completing a 4-year undergraduate program in engineering resulting in the award of a Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of Technology degree. Kathmandu University, Tribhuwan University, Pokhara University and Purvanchal University offer this degree. =Japan= In Japan, the , which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is a research degree between the bachelor's degree and the doctor's degree and requires completion of a thesis. =Singapore= In Singapore, the Master of Engineering is a research-based postgraduate program that typically lasts 2 to 3 years including coursework and must be completed by a comprehensive thesis evaluated by an examination committee. It is generally awarded as a pre-doctoral qualification in the field of engineering. This is in contrast to the \\"master of science\\" programs in engineering which are coursework-based and do not require a research thesis. =South Korea= In South Korea, the Master of Engineering, which takes a minimum of two years, is a postgraduate program that follows the undergraduate of four years. It is commonly awarded for specializations in the field of engineering rather than the science. For example, the degree \\"master of science in computer science\\" differs from the degree \\"master of engineering in computer science\\" in that the latter one is mainly concentrated on the applicability of the design with strong relation with the hardware rather than the software. Generally, the Master of Engineering program includes both coursework and research. =Poland= Magister in≈ºynier (mgr in≈º., literally: master engineer) academic degree that can be obtained after 2 years post- graduate education (for students having already B.Eng.‚Äîin≈º.) or formerly (until full adaptation of Bologna process by university) through integrated 5 years B.Eng.‚ÄìM.Eng (or B.Sc.‚ÄìM.Sc) program, giving double degree mgr in≈º. =Slovakia= FIIT STU Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) accreditation for two master's degree study programs: Intelligent Software Systems (combined fields of study Software Engineering - major and Artificial Intelligence - secondary) and Internet Technologies (in the field of study Computing Engineering); three bachelor's degree study programs and two doctoral degree study programs. FEI STU engineering Institute of Electrical Engineering (IEE) accreditation =Spain= Before the introduction of the Bologna Process, there were two different Spanish Engineering degrees: \\"Ingenier√≠a\\", which took 5 or in some cases 6 full-time yearly courses; and \\"Ingenier√≠a T√©cnica\\", of a shorter duration: 3 years or in some cases 4 full- time yearly courses. In the wake of the Bologna Process, the Spanish Educational System implanted the \\"M√°ster Habilitante en Ingenier√≠a\\" and the \\"M√°ster Universitario en Ingenier√≠a\\" degrees (Postgraduate Studies), which use the ECTS system designed by the European Union. They are slightly shorter to the second half of the former Engineering (\\"Ingenier√≠a\\") academic degree, whereas the technical engineering degree is approximately similar to the bachelor's degree within the Bologna system. Education in Engineering in Spain had traditionally not too many specialties (Naval, Aerospatial, Industrial, Civil, Telecommunications, Informatics, among others) as in the past specialization was not so necessary but after Bologna the Degrees and Masters branched out numerously, giving birth to hundreds of different combinations, opening the possibility to do a bachelor's degree in one university and specialty and then to take a master's degree on another specialty, perhaps at a different university, having usually passed an individual interview by the Dean and/or a \\"Propedeutics\\" exam or test of some sort, designed to guarantee a solid basis upon which to build further knowledge, that must take into consideration the relationship between the two branches of knowledge and among the subjects being taught at both degrees at the origin and the destination. =Sweden= The \\"Master of Engineering\\" title was introduced in some Swedish universities proceeding the Bologna process. The title \\"civilingenj√∂r\\" (literally translated \\"Civilian engineer\\", the English term \\"Civil engineer\\" is not equivalent to \\"civilingenj√∂r\\") is the equivalent of an M.Eng. as well as the \\"Master of Science in Engineering\\" title. A Master of Science in Engineering is awarded after a minimum of 5 years of studies. Before 2007-07-01, it was awarded after a minimum of 4¬Ω year of studies. Students starting with their studies before 2007-07-01, but finishing them before 2015-06-30 and after 2007-07-01, may choose to obtain the title either after 4¬Ω year or after 5 years. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the degree of Master of Engineering (MEng) is the highest award for undergraduate studies in engineering. It is the standard university-level qualification taken by people wishing to become chartered engineers registered with the Engineering Council (EngC). The MEng degree represents the minimum educational standard required to become a chartered engineer, but there are other equally satisfactory ways to demonstrate this standard such as the completion of a BEng Honours and a subsequent postgraduate diploma, MA or MSc or through experiential learning. The UK MEng (undergraduate degree) is typically equivalent to the European Diplom Ingenieur (Dipl.-Ing.) and Civilingenj√∂r degrees. Universities are free to set their own entry requirements. Some universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge and some courses at Imperial only admit students to study for the MEng degree. (Their courses usually allow a student to leave with a bachelor's degree after three years. More information on which courses are accredited by the Engineering Council for registration as a Chartered Engineer or Incorporated Engineer can be found at https://www.engc.org.uk/education-skills/accreditation-of-higher-education- programmes/) Other universities, such as the University of Greenwich, University of Surrey, Coventry University, Brunel University and Swansea University, admit students to read for BEng Honours and MEng courses and allow students to change between the two during the early years of the course. The Open University offers the MEng degree as a postgraduate qualification but requires students to complete its course within four years of completing a BEng Honours degree. In England, Northern Ireland and Wales the degree is a four-year course or a 'sandwich' five-year course (with one year spent working in industry). In Scotland, it is a five-year course. The Bachelor of Engineering degree (BEng) is usually a three-year course (four in Scotland) or can also include a year in industry. Many universities offer the BEng and may then allow a transfer onto the MEng The Graduateship in engineering, awarded by the City and Guilds of London Institute, an institution established in 1878 and recognized by the Royal Charter (RC117) in 1900, is mapped to a British Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)‚ÄîBEng (Honours)‚Äîdegree. The postgraduate diploma is mapped to a British Master of Engineering (MEng) degree. The Membership in Engineering (MCGI‚ÄîNQF at Level 7) is a strategic Management/Chartered professional level and a postgraduate diploma, mapped to a British master's degree, awarded by the City and Guilds of London Institute. This will be supported by a minimum of ten years of seasoned experience (peer reviewed) in areas as the Engineering + a British bachelor/graduateship (or by CEng). Requirements for professional registration as an Incorporated Engineerhttps://www.engc.org.uk/professional-registration/the-professional- titles/incorporated-engineer/ or a Chartered Engineerhttps://www.engc.org.uk/professional-registration/the-professional- titles/chartered-engineer/ is based on a standard of professional competence and commitment, as set out in the professional standard UK-SPEC. Individuals generally develop these through education and working experience. Chartered Engineer and Incorporated Engineer titles awarded by the Engineering Council UK are very broadly equivalent to (but not the same as) North American Professional Engineer (PEng/PE) and Professional Technologist (PTech) designations, but with often a far greater geographical recognition. However, P.Eng/PE serve a very different purpose than the CEng qualification. PE/P.Eng are licenses to practice engineering in the public domain with legal liability at the state or provincial level. Unlike C.Eng they are not qualifications or titles. Under government legislations they allow one to engage in professional practice in a defined geographic region. For example, in Ontario the P.Eng license is issued within the Professional Engineers Act (established in 1922). Despite the Washington accord PE/PEng does not equal C.Eng. The ability of a C.Eng to practice engineering in the public domain in North America is determined on a case by case basis usually by state or province. Agreements to recognize qualifications between EngC or Engineers Ireland and Engineers Canada or the USA Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) are not recognized by individual states or provinces. Structure MEng degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from bachelor's degrees with lectures, laboratory work, coursework and exams each year. There is usually a substantial project to be completed in the fourth year which may have a research element to it and a more teaching-based project to be completed in the third year. At the end of the third year, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to allow progression to the final year. At some universities, the structure of the final year is rather different from that of the first three, for example, at the University of York, the final year for the Computer Systems and Software program consists entirely of project work and intensive advanced seminar courses rather than traditional lectures and problem classes. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard British undergraduate degree classification scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail' as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified. History At some universities in the UK in the early 1980s, the MEng was awarded as a taught postgraduate degree after 12 months of study. Its entry requirements would typically be like those for other taught postgraduate courses, including holding an undergraduate degree and its format would be similar to the modern MEng although, as with many postgraduate master's degrees, the project would extend over a longer period. MEng courses in their modern, undergraduate form were introduced in the mid-1980s in response to growing competition from technical-degree graduates from continental Europe, where undergraduate bachelor's degree courses are often longer than the usual three years in the UK. There was a feeling among recent graduates, the engineering institutions, employers and universities, that the longer and more in-depth study offered on the continent needed to be made available to UK students as well. Since to obtain a taught master's degree in the UK typically took an additional year beyond a bachelor's degree, it was decided that this extra year would be integrated into the undergraduate program and, instead of pursuing both a bachelor's and master's degree, students would proceed directly to a master's degree. Since its introduction, the MEng has become the degree of choice for most undergraduate engineers, as was intended. The most common exception to this is international students who, because of the substantially higher fees they are charged, sometimes opt to take the tradition BEng/B.Sc. route where that is available. Most of the engineering institutions have now made an MEng the minimum academic standard necessary to become a Chartered Engineer. Students who graduated before the changes in the rules will still be allowed to use their bachelor's degree for this purpose and those who have earned a bachelor's degree since the changes can usually take some additional courses (known as 'further learning') over time to reach an equivalent standard to the MEng Some older universities such as Durham allow students to obtain the BEng degree after the third year before continuing on to the fourth year. Other undergraduate masters The MEng is one of a number of integrated master's degrees introduced in the UK since the late 20th century, the other major degree introduced being MSci (Master in Science). Some universities, however, have chosen to award subject specific integrated master's degrees, in subjects such as Mathematics (MMath), Computer Science (MCompSci), Physics (MPhys), Chemistry (MChem) and Biology (MBiol). =United States= In the United States, the Master of Engineering degree is generally a professional degree offered as a coursework-based alternative to the traditional research-based Master of Science. It is typically a two-year program, entered after the completion of a 4-year bachelor's degree and many universities allow students to choose between the Master of Engineering and the Master of Science. The Master of Engineering degree is offered at many leading universities in the United States on either a full-time and part-time (weekends or evenings) basis and is considered a terminal degree in the field of engineering. Some M.Eng. degree programs require a scholarly project in addition to coursework. They require additional courses beyond those required for Master of Science students in order to better prepare students for professional careers. Some of them highly encourage students to participate in collaborative consulting projects. These courses may include topics such as business fundamentals, management and leadership.Master of Engineering, Duke University, http://meng.pratt.duke.edu/ See also * British degree abbreviations * Engineering Doctorate References Engineering, Master of Engineering education ","title":"Master of Engineering"},{"id":"999794","text":".bz is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Belize.

As Principal Investigator of the research project Studies in the Creative Process, Rothenberg has focused on the creative processes of consensually recognized and defined creators. These have included Nobel laureates in physics, chemistry, medicine and physiology; Pulitzer Prize and other literary prize winners; and consensually designated young literary and artistic creators. He has also practiced clinical psychiatry and been administrator and therapist at the Yale Psychiatric Institute, New Haven, Connecticut; John Dempsey Hospital in Farmington, Connecticut; the Austen Riggs Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, as well as undertakinging private psychiatric outpatient practice in Chatham, New York.  Biography  = Early life and education = Rothenberg was born in New York City on June 2, 1930, to Gabriel Rothenberg and Rose Goldberg Rothenberg. His father Gabriel was born in Romania and came to the United States at the age of seventeen. At 23 years old, Gabriel fought in the US Army during the First World War. Other than attending night school for English, Gabriel had no formal advanced education but later become a successful manufacturing businessman in Danbury, Connecticut. His mother, born in New Haven, Connecticut, was a pianist and became a principal secretary after attending a New York City secretarial school. An eldest brother died immediately after childbirth and Rothenberg's -year-older brother, Jerome Rothenberg, who was quite sickly as a child, survived to become a distinguished American Economist. Rothenberg attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn, New York where he graduated as Salutatorian. = Career = As an undergraduate at Harvard College, Rothenberg majored in Social Relations and graduated with honors. There, he was influenced to pursue later research in creativity through the example and thought of psychologists Henry Murray and George Klein. His medical career began at Tufts University School of Medicine where he was awarded both the annual Dermatology Prize and Medical Alumni Award. After graduation as doctor of medicine he went on to pursue residency training in psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine. In 1960, he was appointed to the Yale Medical School faculty. During early years at Yale, he was supported in research and teaching by two successive 5-year federal Research Career Investigator Grants. There was an interruption of two years when Rothenberg served as Captain in the U.S. Army Medical Corps as Chief Psychiatrist for American military personnel in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean area. For this service, he received both a Letter of commendation and a Certificate of Merit. He then returned to Yale Medical School, where he remained for nearly 20 years. In 1976, Rothenberg moved to the University of Connecticut Department Of Psychiatry at Farmington, where he served as the Clinical Director and Director of Psychiatric Residency for the next three years. In 1979, he became the Director of Research at the Austen Riggs Center, an open psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Massachusetts and a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty. Rothenberg was appointed Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard in 1986. The same year, he began a course of three separate research years as a Fellow at institutes for advanced study. In 1986, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University; In 1993, he was a Fellow at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences in Wassenaar; and he returned as a Fellow to CASBS in 2014. In addition to his research on creativity, he has published two novels: Living Color (2001), a story about the slashing of a famous painting in the modern art museum in Amsterdam and Madness and Glory (2012), a story about Dr. Phillipe Pinel, the father of modern psychiatry. = Research = Rothenberg has carried out controlled experimental research with young writers and artists and controlled interview investigations with outstanding prize-winning authors. He found that three interrelated cognitive processes were responsible for their creative achievements. Also, through extensive and intensive research with Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine, Physics, and Chemistry the same processes were found to be operating in their far- reaching and outstanding creative achievements. The three cognitive processes, all of which disrupt the past and the usual and lead to creations are: Janusian process (previously designated as janusian thinking; derived from the Roman god Janus), consists of actively conceiving and using multiple opposite or antithetical thoughts or constructions simultaneously. The janusian process leads to creation in conceptual and verbal modalities. Homospatial process (derived from Greek homo) consists of actively conceiving and using two or more discrete entities in the same mental space, a conception leading to the articulation of new identities. The homospatial process leads to creation primarily in the metaphoric and spatial modalities. Sep-con articulation process consists of actively conceiving and using separation (sep) and connection (con) concomitantly. The sep-con articulation process leads to integrative effects and integration in creation.  Significance  Although, as commonly used, the term creativity has been applied to a wide range of behavior, events, and practices, these have often consisted of simply different or deviant, uncommon, or unusual occurrences. Many studies have been derived from personal intuition or anecdotes, and have often focused simply on skills, divergent thinking or employment in particular types of artistic or scientific occupations. On an operational basis, however, creativity and creative activity is positively valued, usually definitively so, and the value must be consensually validated and stand the test of time. Moreover, creativity differs from productivity or competence alone‚Äîit consists of yielding something novel or new. Rothenberg's work and findings have consistently focused on a strict definition of creativity as the state or production of both newness and value (intrinsic or instrumental). Clear-cut results and applications of these investigations have measured, in whole or in part, all types and levels of creativity. The findings produced by his research consist, for the first time, of empirically determined highly specific and operational types of creative processes. These have been described through his work in the fields of science and literature, visual art, and psychotherapy. = Personal life = Rothenberg is married to Julia Johnson Rothenberg, Emerita Professor of Education at Sage Colleges and noted visual artist and musician. They divide residence each year between homes in the U.S. and southern France. Rothenberg has three children from a former marriage: Michael, Mora and Rina, and eight grandchildren: Elsa, Claire, Maya, Sam, Reed, Ellis, Gabriel, and Lucy.

Supporters contend that the hand is from a Yeti, a scientifically unrecognized animal purported to live in the Himalayan mountains. A finger bone from the hand was tested and the DNA shown to be human. History Oil businessman and adventurer Tom Slick first heard accounts of the possible existence of a \\"Yeti hand\\" held as a ritual artifact in the monastery at Pangboche during one of his first \\"Abominable Snowman\\" treks in 1957. The Slick expeditions were the first to bring photographs of the hand back to the West. During later Tom Slick-sponsored expeditions in and around the Himalayas, his associates gathered more information on the \\"Pangboche hand,\\" and an effort to further examine it was planned. In 1959 Peter Byrne, a member of Slick's expedition that year, reportedly stole pieces of the artifact after the monks who owned it refused to allow its removal for study. Byrne claimed to have replaced the stolen bone fragments with human bones, rewrapping the hand to disguise his theft. Byrne smuggled the bones from Nepal into India, after which actor James Stewart allegedly smuggled the hand out of the country in his luggage. Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman rediscovered this story while writing Tom Slick's biography in the 1980s. Coleman confirmed details of the incidents with written materials in the Slick archives, interviews with Byrne, and correspondence with Stewart. Byrne later confirmed the Pangboche hand story via a letter from Stewart that Byrne published in a general book on Nepalese wildlife.see Coleman's books Tom Slick and the Search for Yeti (Boston/London: Faber and Faber, 1989) and Tom Slick: True Life Encounters in Cryptozoology (Fresno, CA: Linden Press, 2002). During the highly publicized 1960 World Book expedition, which had many goals including gathering intelligence on Chinese rocket launchings, Sir Edmund Hillary and Marlin Perkins took a sidetrip in Nepal to investigate the hand. Hillary was unaware of the possibility that he was looking at a combination of the original material and the human bones placed there by Byrne. Hillary determined the artifact was a hoax. According to monks at Pangboche monastery, many years ago, a monk walked into a cave to meditate. There, he saw a Yeti. Many years later, he came back, and the yeti was dead. He collected the hand and scalp and took it back to the monastery where it remained until it was discovered in the modern age. London University primatologist William Charles Osman Hill conducted a physical examination of the pieces that Byrne supplied. His first findings were that it was hominid, and later in 1960 he decided that the Pangboche fragments were a closer match with a Neanderthal. In 1991, in conjunction with Coleman's research, it was discovered that the Slick expedition consultant, an American anthropologist by the name of George Agogino, had retained samples of the alleged Yeti hand. The NBC program Unsolved Mysteries obtained samples and determined they were similar to human tissue, but were not human, and could only verify they were \\"near human.\\" After the broadcast of the program, the entire hand was stolen from the Pangboche monastery, and reportedly disappeared into a private collection via the illegal underground in the sale of antiquities. George Agogino, before his death on September 11, 2000, transferred his important files on the Pangboche Yeti hand to Loren Coleman.George Allen Agogino In 2010 Weta Workshops produced a replica skull and hand based on photos of the missing hand and skull. Mike Allsop handed over the replica skull and hand to monks at Pangboche in May 2011. DNA testing On 27 December 2011 it was announced that a finger belonging to the hand contained human DNA, following tests carried out in Edinburgh. Dr. Rob Ogden commented that \\"We have got a very, very strong match to a number of existing reference sequences on human DNA databases...

Early life Jos√© Eustasio Rivera was born on February 19, 1888 in Aguas Calientes, a hamlet of the city of Neiva, later that year the hamlet was incorporated into the newly created municipality of San Mateo, which was later renamed Rivera in honour of Jos√© Eustasio. His parents were Eustasio Rivera Escobar and Catalina Salas, and he was the first boy and fifth child out of eleven children, out of which eight made into adulthood, Jos√© Eustasio, Luis Enrique, Margarita, Virginia, Laura, Susana, Julia and Ernestina. In spite of his family's economic situation, he received a catholic education thanks to the help of other relatives and his own efforts. He attended Santa Librada school in Neiva and San Luis Gonzaga in El√≠as. In 1906 he received a scholarship to study at the normal school in Bogot√°. In 1909, after graduating, he moved to Ibagu√© where he worked as a school inspector. In 1912 he enrolled at the Faculty of Law and Political Sciences of National University, graduating as a lawyer in 1917. Career After a failed attempt to be elected for the senate, he was appointed Legal Secretary of the Colombo- Venezuelan Border Commission to determine the limits with Venezuela, there he had the opportunity to travel through the Colombian jungles, rivers, and mountains, giving him a first hand experience of the subjects he would later write. Disappointed with the lack of resources offered by his government for his trip, he abandoned the commission and continued travelling on his own. He later rejoined the commission, but before that he went to Brazil, where he became acquainted with the work of important Brazilian writers of his time, particularly Euclides da Cunha. In this venture he became familiar with life in the Colombian plains and with problems related to the extraction of rubber in the Amazon jungle, a matter that would be central in his major work, La vor√°gine (1924) (translated as The Vortex), now considered one of the most important novels in Latin American literary history. To write this novel he read extensively about the situation of rubber workers in the Amazon basin. After the success of his novel, he was elected, in 1925, as a member for the Investigative Commission for Exterior Relations and Colonization. He also published several articles in newspapers in Colombia. In these pieces, he criticized irregularities in government contracts, and denounced the abandonment of the rubber areas of Colombia and the mistreatment of workers. He also publicly defended his novel, which had been criticized by some Colombian literary critics as being too poetic. This criticism would be largely silenced by the wide praise the novel was receiving everywhere else. Death Rivera had arrived in New York the last week of April 1928 in the hopes of translating his novel into English, publishing it in the United States, and turning it into a motion picture film with the goal of exporting Colombian culture abroad. His venture, albeit riffled with difficulties, was moving along when on November 27 he suffered an attack of seizures and was taken to the Stuyvesant Polyclinic Hospital where he remained for four days in a comatose state until his death on December 1, 1928. After his death, his body was transported by ship from New York to Barranquilla on the United Fruit Company's ship the Sixaola. At his arrival on port, his body was transported in procession to the Pro-Cathedral of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino where a requiem mass was given and the body laid in chapelle ardente. The casket then made its way down the Magdalena onto Bogot√° on the mail steamship Carbonell Gonz√°lez, arriving in Girardot and finishing by train to arrive in Bogot√° on January 7, 1929 and was taken directly to the Capitolio Nacional where it was placed lying in state for public viewing. His body was finally laid to rest in the Central Cemetery of Bogot√° on January 19.

They are based in Enugu and play their home games at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium. Enugu Rangers are one of the three oldest clubs in Nigeria since their formation in 1970, the other two being Bendel Insurance and Kano Pillars. They are the only Nigerian team never to have been relegated from the Nigeria Premier League. History =The 1970s= Enugu Rangers were founded in 1970 and won a nationally organised tournament which allowed them to qualify for the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs. Rangers first international tournament ended in defeat in the quarterfinal rounds, losing 0‚Äì3 on aggregate to ASEC Mimosas. They almost achieved instant success in the cup as well, making the final of the first Nigerian FA Cup in 1971, but losing 2‚Äì1 to Shooting Stars F.C.. After winning the 1974 double, including a 2‚Äì0 cup final win over Mighty Jets, the Enugu players were given promotions at the Nigerian Sports Council and cars. Rangers lost the 1975 African Cup of Champions Clubs to Guinea's Hafia FC, earning left-back Silvanus Okpalla the nickname \\"Hafia\\" for his poor play in the final. Enugu had overturned a 3‚Äì1 defeat in Egypt in the semifinal to qualify for the final. Founding Ranger Ernest Ufele retired after the defeat. International success finally came in 1977. The club, now managed by their first-ever captain Godwin Achebe, had lost several players to Ibo state when the new jurisdiction was created in 1976. In the quarterfinals, they were held to a goalless draw at home by defensively minded ASF Police of Dakar. Twenty minutes into the second half, Rangers took the lead, silencing the Senegal stadium, and won the game 2‚Äì1. After the game ended, Nigerian press noted the team was beaten by Senegalese fans, including three stabbed Rangers players. A military plane was flown to Dakar to evacuate the victors. The 1977 semi- finals set up one of the greatest ties in Nigerian football history as Enugu were drawn against Shooting Stars. Rangers would go on to defeat Canon Yaounde 5‚Äì2 on aggregate in the final, including a 4‚Äì1 win on Nigerian soil. During this time period, Rangers boasted a number of Nigerian national team players such as Christian Chukwu, goalkeeper Emmanuel Okala and Aloysius Atuegbu. =The 1980s= Led by coach Christian Chukwu, Enugu won the 1983 Nigerian Cup, defeating DIC Bees of Kaduna 5‚Äì4 on penalties after a 0‚Äì0 draw. Rangers won their sixth title in 1984 with a number of players who had led Nigeria to the 1980 African Cup of Nations. Louis Igwilo captained the team. =The 1990s: lean years= Rangers joined the new fully professional league in 1990 and made cup final that year, losing to Stationery Stores on 5‚Äì4 on penalty kicks. They would not make another cup final appearance in the decade, and their best league finish was third in 1998. =The 2000s= Enugu topped the table after the 2001 home and away season but finished bottom of the four-team championship playoff group. Enugu Rangers made the group stage of the 2004 CAF Confederation Cup and missed out on winning the group and making the final after losing a head-to-head tiebreaker to Asante Kotoko. Rangers drew 0‚Äì0 against Angola's Petro de Luanda and celebrated, thinking they had advanced on goal difference, but the first tiebreaker was head-to-head. In 2008‚Äì09, they played some games in nearby Abakaliki and Nnewi as their stadium was renovated for the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Before the season started, Enugu State governor Sullivan Chime paid the backlog of sign-on fees dating to three years ago and all other debts owed the players. In November 2008, Rangers became the first Nigerian clubside to be a public company and sell ownership stock. However the deal fell through, and the club began the 2009 season in debt. The club is currently owned by the state government. Enugu did begin a 12-year run of success in a minor trophy, the local state FA Cup, which they won every year from 2005 to 2017. =2016‚Äìcurrent: Success again= After a 2015 season which nearly saw them relegated, Enugu won the 2016 Nigeria Premier League, their first championship since 1982. Closest challengers Rivers United needed Enugu to lose on the final day of the season, but Rangers won their game against El-Kanemi Warriors 4‚Äì0 to win the championship. 2017 saw Enugu struggle, dropping into the relegation zone halfway through the season. They recovered, finishing 14th and keeping alive their streak of never being relegated from the top flight. The club went on to won their first Nigerian Cup in 35 years in 2018. Rangers stunned Kano Pillars, coming back from a 3‚Äì0 deficit to win the trophy on penalties. Ajani Ibrahim scored on a diving header two minutes into stoppage time to tie the game 3‚Äì3. Rangers played in the final five times from 1987 to 2007, never winning once. In the first championship playoff clash on Wednesday, June 13, 2019, Enugu Rangers defeated FC IfeanyiUbah 4‚Äì2 in a six-goal thriller to secure a CAF Confederation Cup ticket.

Hamilton, the second book in The Night's Dawn Trilogy. It follows on from The Reality Dysfunction and precedes The Naked God. It was published in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Publishers on 20 October 1997. The first United States edition, which is broken into two volumes, Consolidation and Conflict, followed in April and May 1998 from Time Warner Books. The second US edition, as a single volume, was published in December 2008 by Orbit Books. This novel, along with others in the series, is noted for its length (more than 1,000 pages long in paperback) and technological depth. Background In The Reality Dysfunction, the presence of an energy-based alien lifeform during the death of a human on the colony world of Lalonde somehow 'jammed open' the interface between this universe and 'the beyond', an energistic vacuum where the souls of dead humans (and possibly other races) have become trapped after death. They are able to cross back over into this universe and possess the living, gaining tremendous strength, agility and the ability to create and alter matter. They overrun the planet Lalonde in a matter of weeks and spread beyond to the planets Atlantis and Norfolk and to the independent habitat Valisk, among others. The Kulu Kingdom colony world of Ombey is also infiltrated and a veteran of the Lalonde fiasco, Ralph Hiltch, is drafted in to help contain the menace. At the end of The Reality Dysfunction the truth of the nature of the threat is discovered by several survivors of a botched attempt to rescue the situation on Lalonde. However, a second threat has also emerged. Dr. Alkad Mzu, creator of the feared 'Alchemist' weapon of mass destruction, has escaped from Tranquillity and apparently seeks revenge on Omuta, the world that destroyed her own home planet of Garissa thirty years earlier. Plot summary The voidhawk Oenone reaches Jupiter and docks with one of the 4,250 habitats orbiting the planet. Whilst medical assistance and trauma counselling begin to help heal Syrinx, the information from Laton and the events on Atlantis is transmitted to the Jovian Consensus. As they become aware of the scale of the crisis, the Edenists immediately switch their economy to a war footing, rendering Jupiter space impregnable to attack. They also develop personality-query systems which should render all Edenists, voidhawks and habitats immune to possession. They detach a quarter of the voidhawk fleet and assign it to reinforce the Confederation Navy. Admiral Aleksandrovich summons an emergency session of the Confederation Assembly on its meeting world of Avon. On Avon the Confederation Assembly is stunned to learn of the threat from the possessed. The Confederation Navy shuts down all interstellar flights to contain the threat and goes to its highest state of alert. In a startling move, the Tyrathca immediately cut themselves off from all contact with humanity for the duration of the crisis. The Kiint ambassador reveals that, many thousands of years ago, they also suffered a 'possession crisis', as the secret of death is one that is eventually discovered by all sentient races. They claim that their solution to the crisis is not applicable to humanity, who must find their own way. Alkad Mzu departs from the blackhawk Udat, leaving behind a virus in its jump system which causes the destruction of Udat whilst making a wormhole transit. She does this both to protect knowledge of her whereabouts and also as revenge: Udat was one of the blackhawks which crippled the Beezling just before the Garissan Genocide. On the planet Norfolk, the possessed succeed in over-running most of the planet. Louise Kavanagh's father, Grant, is possessed and gives up his home estate to forces loyal to Quinn Dexter. However, Dexter's attempts to have Louise and her sister Genevieve possessed are thwarted by another possessed, who assists Louise and Genevieve in reaching the nearest aerodrome. He reveals his name ‚Äì Fletcher Christian ‚Äì and vows to protect them from those who mean them harm. He bemoans the lack of chivalry and honour among his fellow returnees. They flee to the capital, which is in danger of falling, and briefly find refuge with Louise's cousins, the Hewsons. One of the cousins, Roberto, attempts to rape Louise, but fortunately is thwarted. After this, with her parents declared missing, Louise takes control of the Kavanagh fortune and is able to use this to book passage on a starship fleeing the system for Earth. They end up on a ship owned by SII (Mars' national company) and eventually reach High York, an asteroid in the O'Neill Halo in orbit above Earth. Christian's true nature is detected and he, Louise and Genevieve are all arrested. On Ombey Ralph Hiltch assists the local police and military in tracking down the possessed from Lalonde. Princess Kirsten authorises the use of lethal force and, in a move which establishes a precedent across the Confederation, the planet's own strategic defence platforms are turned against the possessed, destroying an aircraft and several buses carrying them. One bus manages to get onto Mortonridge, a hilly peninsula, and the entire human population of nearly two million is possessed. SD platforms and the military manage to seal off the peninsula, containing the possessed in this one area. The leader of the possessed, Annette Ekelund, agrees to a cessation of hostilities until a more permanent solution to the crisis is found. However, the Kulu Kingdom is unwilling to look inactive whilst its citizens are in danger, and contingency plans are made. Hiltch visits Kulu itself and is shocked to learn that there was an outbreak of possession in Nova Kong, the capital, but it was put down hard by the authorities. King Alastair agrees to authorise an alliance with the Edenists, who will provide bitek soldiers to help retake Mortonridge. They know now that the possessed fear zero-tau and plan to use thousands of zero- tau pods to force the possessed to give up their bodies. The campaign will likely be bloody, but the Confederation badly needs a victory. Joshua Calvert and the crew of the Lady MacBeth return to Tranquillity with news of events on Lalonde. Kelly Tirrel becomes an overnight celebrity for her reports of the conflict on Lalonde, and the children rescued from the planet are well-treated in the habitat's children's home. Ione asks Joshua Calvert to take his ship and pursue Alkad Mzu and Udat wherever they have gone. Ione believes that the Alchemist may pose as great a threat as the possessed. Joshua reluctantly agrees. Before he departs, Father Horst Elwes relates to him a story about how he was able to 'exorcise' a possessing spirit on Lalonde and tells Joshua to have faith. On New California a few possessed manage to get loose on the planet, but they are disorganised and unable to make much headway. One of the possessed appears to be a raving lunatic, but as the days pass the possessing soul's presence in a normally-functioning brain restore his sanity and his memory. The possessing soul turns out to be Al Capone, a famed gangster from 20th century Chicago. Capone organises the possessed and they take over the planet in a matter of weeks. Capone realises they need to keep the planet's economy and starship-building capability going to defend themselves from any counter-attack, so many citizens are spared from possession (the act of which interferes with electrical systems nearby) as long as they contribute to the expansion of Capone's 'Organisation'. The interstellar superstar Jezebelle (a singer and 'mood-fantasy' artist) is on the planet at the time and she rapidly becomes Capone's lover, but also proves to be a valuable source of intelligence on the Confederation. The Organisation spreads to another planet and its ships begin causing problems for the Confederation Navy. First Admiral Samual Aleksandrovich learns that the Organisation's next conquest will be the planet Toi Hoi and develops a plan to intercept and destroy their fleet there. Quinn Dexter leaves Norfolk and travels to Earth, hoping to infiltrate the arcologies there. However, Earth's defences and security measures are far too strong for him to penetrate. He instead travels to a planet called Nyvan, one of the earliest colonies founded before the policy of ethnic-streaming colonies came into effect. As a result, the planet is locked in a permanent state of cold war. Dexter effectively takes over one of the orbital asteroids. During his conquest he discovers it is possible to shift his body into a 'ghost realm', where he finds more dead souls. They claim that when someone dies only some are trapped in a beyond, whilst others become locked in a ghost-like state. Although he has no use for the ghosts, Dexter realises he can use this new ability to break through Earth's security again. In the Valisk habitat, the possessed, aided by Dariat, become organised and swiftly take over much of the habitat. Rubra, the personality controlling the habitat, tries to reason with Dariat to little avail. Kiera, the leader of the possessed on Valisk (and the possessor of Marie Skibbow), travels to New California and is able to secure an alliance with the Organisation. Thanks to Dariat's knowledge of bitek systems, he is able to arrange for several dozen blackhawks to be possessed. The resulting 'hellhawks' become a valuable asset and Kiera is able to sell their skills to the Organisation. However, Dariat becomes gradually opposed to the possessed, due to their brutal tactics and penchant for destruction. He decides to side with Rubra, helps some of the non-possessed population to evacuate, and then merges his personality with Rubra's in the neural strata. The resulting blast of energy ends the threat of the possessed but also rips Valisk out of the material universe and into a strange realm of grey mists. Dariat is horrified to wake up and discover that he is now a ghost. At Jupiter, Syrinx recovers from her injuries. She visits Eden, the original habitat, where the personality of Wing-Tsit Chong, Edenism's founder, lives on in the habitat's neural strata. With his guidance, Syrinx is able to overcome both the trauma of her experience and also her prejudice against Adamists. Syrinx and Oenone begin flying again and are assigned to a Confederation Navy squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Meredith Saldana, which is assigned to the upcoming Toi Hoi interception mission. Saldana's squadron travels to Tranquillity, where Ione Saldana agrees ‚Äì reluctantly ‚Äì to let them use the habitat as a staging ground for the attack. On Trafalgar, the Confederation Navy HQ asteroid orbiting Avon, a possessed prisoner demands a hearing to confirm her human rights and stop the Navy personnel running tests on her. However, she nearly escapes during the hearing and manages to have several other people possessed, one of whom has knowledge of the Toi Hoi operation. She re-kills this individual, and then surrenders to the staff. At New California the possessing soul from Trafalgar manages to get reincarnated and warns Capone of the Toi Hoi ambush. Capone prepares his own plan in response. In Tranquillity the Kiint researchers at the Ruin Ring project become intrigued by reports reaching them about a Tyrathca religion they previously did not know about (when one of the children from Lalonde tells a Kiint youth about it). They acquire the relevant data about the Sleeping God from Kelly Tirrel. Tranquillity observes this and Tirrel gives Ione a copy of the data. Ione is puzzled ‚Äì the Tyrathca are a notably unimaginative species and have no need for supernatural deities ‚Äì but her advisors suggest that the Sleeping God is actually a real entity who was able to aid the Tyrathca centuries ago, and may be able to aid humanity now against the threat of the possessed. Joshua Calvert's hunt for Mzu and the Alchemist takes him to several worlds and asteroid settlements. On Ayachuko asteroid, in the Dorados, he is shocked to discover that he has a half-brother, Liol, the result of a liaison between Joshua's father Marcus and a local woman nearly thirty years ago. With possessed loosed on Ayachucko, Joshua agrees to let Liol depart with them. Joshua is attacked by a possessed but his attempt to 'exorcise' him as per Elwes' instruction fails, apparently because the possessing spirit was a Sunni Muslim and has no fear of Joshua's crucifix. Joshua and his crew manage to escape. Mzu's trail leads them to Nyvan. Joshua's pursuit is hampered by agents from the Edenist Intelligence service (led by Samual) and the Kulu External Security Agency (led by Monica Foulkes) who have surprisingly joined forces in their own pursuit of Mzu. Possessed loosed on Nyvan have also learned of Mzu's weapon and are searching for her. The pursuit culminates in a showdown at an iron yard. Joshua and his companions survive thanks to the intervention of a man with strange abilities named Dick Keaton, and are able to extract Mzu safely, although they also have to pick up Monica and Samual. Dexter destroys an orbital asteroid with nuclear bombs, causing a rain of asteroid chunks to fall on and annihilate the planet's biosphere. Satisfied with the chaos he has caused, Dexter departs for Earth. He abandons his comrades, slips into the ghost realm to evade security, and reappears in the space elevator descending towards the planet. Safely aboard Joshua's ship Mzu explains how thirty years ago she and other Garrisan starships were on a mission to deploy the Alchemist when they were ambushed and left for dead by Omutan hired blackhawks (as portrayed in the first chapter of The Reality Dysfunction). They were left with two badly damaged ships, one with an active ZTT drive and the other without. With a difficult decision ahead, they decided to place 30 crewmembers in zero-tau and the Alchemist on the damaged Beezling, and send them to the nearest uninhabited star two and a half light-years away at sub-light speed (9% the speed of light due to the lack of a ZTT drive), what would be a 28-year journey. Mzu and others escaped via ZTT jump on the remaining ship with the intentions of rendezvousing with the Beezling upon its arrival in 28 years. Mzu finally reveals the location coordinates of the uninhabited star that the Beezling is now orbiting and Joshua and his crew race to the star with the intentions of intercepting and destroying the Alchemist. Upon their arrival they discover the Alchemist and the Beezling with most of its crew intact. During the rescue Joshua's ship is ambushed by two Organization hellhawks that pursued them from Nyvan. Finding himself greatly outmaneuvered, Joshua pulls off a daring stunt by deploying the Alchemist into a nearby gas giant causing it to go nova, destroying the two Organization ships. Joshua meanwhile uses his ship's anti- matter drive to safely accelerate away from the nova at forty-two gees to a distance where they can make a proper ZTT jump. With knowledge of the Confederation's Toi Hoi assault fleet grouping and refuelling at Tranquility, the Organisation fleet, aided by a large number of hellhawks, stages a massive assault on Tranquillity, surrounding the habitat and its few blackhawk mercenary and Confederation Navy defenders. They demand Tranquillity's immediate surrender. When Ione hesitates, they launch over 5,000 anti-matter weapons at the habitat. Later, when Lady Macbeth arrives at Mirchusko, they find a vast radioactive dead zone where Tranquillity used to be. However, there is insufficient debris or disintegrated matter in orbit to suggest the station was destroyed. Its fate is unknown. The story concludes in The Naked God.  Notes  This novel features two appearances by actual historical figures among the possessed. Fletcher Christian, who led the Mutiny on the Bounty, and 1930s American gangster Al Capone, both have prominent storylines. There is also a comedic interlude between two men both claiming to be Elvis Presley, although the implication is that both are merely Elvis impersonators. Two lengthy subplots were cut from the novel. Taking place on Srinagar, the Hindu-ethnic planet in the same system as Valisk, this would have had an army of possessed conquering the planet with bitek constructs. The second plot would have involved Louise and Genevieve's ship crash-landing on Mars. Both plots were dropped for space reasons.  References  *  External links  *Official Peter F.

He began his career in Hollywood as a producer of The Hank McCune Show, a seminal sitcom produced in 1951. In 1954, James H. Nicholson founded the American Releasing Corporation, which later became known as American International Pictures, and made Arkoff the vice- president. AIP films were mostly low-budget, with production completed in a few days, though nearly all of them became profitable. Along with business partner James H. Nicholson and producer-director Roger Corman, he produced eighteen films. Arkoff is also credited with starting a few genres, such as the Beach Party and outlaw biker movies, and his company played a substantial part in bringing the horror film genre to a novel level with successes such as Blacula, I Was a Teenage Werewolf and The Thing with Two Heads. American International Pictures movies starred many established actors in principal or cameo roles, such as Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester and Vincent Price, as well as others who later became household names, including Don Johnson, Nick Nolte, Diane Ladd, and most notably Jack Nicholson. A number of actors shunned or overlooked by most of Hollywood during the 1960s and 1970s, such as Bruce Dern and Dennis Hopper, also found work in one or more of Arkoff's productions. Arkoff's most financially successful film was the 1979 adaptation of Jay Anson's book The Amityville Horror. Following the sale of AIP to Filmways in 1979 for $30 million, Arkoff was unhappy with the direction of the company and resigned in December 1979 to set up his own production company, Arkoff International Pictures., receiving a payout worth $1.4 million.

Hamilton, the third book in The Night's Dawn Trilogy, following on from The Reality Dysfunction and The Neutronium Alchemist. It was published in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Publishers on 8 October 1999. This was the first novel by Hamilton to be published in hardcover in the United States, on 22 October 1999. As with the first two volumes, the US paperback was split into two volumes, entitled Flight and Faith, published in November and December 2000. In February 2009 Orbit Books issued the first one-volume paperback edition of the novel in the US. Even by the standards of the first two books, The Naked God is an extremely large volume. It was only possible to publish the UK paperback in one volume by moderately decreasing the font size compared to the previous novels. Although the final novel so far in the Night's Dawn Universe (a 'guidebook' to the setting, The Confederation Handbook, was later published), Hamilton has occasionally hinted at returning to the setting in future books in the form of a sequel series set up to 500 years after the events in the trilogy.  Background  In The Reality Dysfunction, the presence of an energy-based alien lifeform during the death of a human on the colony world of Lalonde somehow 'jammed open' the interface between this universe and 'the beyond', an energistic vacuum where the souls of dead humans (and other races, although they inhabit different areas within that realm) have become trapped after death. They are able to cross back over into this universe and possess the living, gaining tremendous strength, agility and the ability to create and alter matter. They overrun the planet Lalonde in a matter of weeks and spread beyond to many other worlds and asteroid settlements. A failed attempt to conquer the planet Atlantis alerts the Edenists to the threat. In The Neutronium Alchemist, the Confederation learns of the extent of the danger and imposes a complete shut-down of all interstellar flight to quarantine the possessed on the few planets they have secured a foothold on. However, quarantine-busting flights soon spread the possessed further. The deployment of military forces against the possessed is complicated by the fact that killing the possessor also kills the possessed victim. This depressing fact, creating the greatest hostage situation in human history, threatens to undermine morale. Eventually, the Kulu Kingdom joins forces with their ideological opponents, the Edenists, to retake the peninsula of Mortonridge on their colony world of Ombey from the possessed to provide the Confederation with proof that the possessed can be beaten. Elsewhere, the most infamous 'returnee' of the possessed, Al Capone, uses his organisational skills to conquer the planet New California and turn it into the hub of an expanding empire, 'The Organisation', with the Confederation Navy hard-pressed to deal with checking its advance whilst maintaining the quarantine. At the conclusion of The Neutronium Alchemist, the personnel of Tranquillity learned that over a thousand years ago a Tyrathca arkship encountered a space-borne entity known as the 'Sleeping God' which exhibited enormous powers which may be of use against the possessed. Before this information could be passed onto anyone, the habitat came under concerted attack by the Organisation. When Captain Calvert and the crew of the Lady MacBeth arrived back at Tranquillity, they found the habitat missing, presumed possessed and taken out of the universe.  Plot summary  Jay Hilton, one of the surviving children from Lalonde, is awoken when Tranquillity falls under attack by the Organisation and its hellhawk allies. With the habitat in imminent danger of destruction, the Kiint personnel immediately evacuate by triggering their 'Emergency Exodus Facility', personal wormholes that transport them to the real Kiint home star system. An infant Kiint, Haile, decides that she can't let Jay be killed in the attack and activates the Emergency Exodus Facility on her, removing her from Tranquillity as well, to the displeasure of her parents, Nang and Lieria. Jay finds herself on a planet which appears to be just one in a necklace of hundreds orbiting a star in the same orbit. Haile's parents reluctantly confirm that this, the Kiint home system, is actually in another galaxy, and the supposed Kiint homeworld of Jobis was actually just a single scientific outpost. They regretfully announce that Tranquillity has either been destroyed or forced to surrender to the possessed. The Jovian Consensus is placed on an emergency alert when a colossal wormhole opens above Jupiter. They are shocked when the habitat Tranquillity appears. Ione Saldana reveals that Michael Saldana feared that whatever destroyed the Laymil might return to its system, and gave Tranquillity the means to escape that threat. The Lady Macbeth journeys to Trafalgar and there reveal the events of their mission to the First Admiral, who is happy that the Alchemist has been destroyed and Alkad Mzu is no longer at large. Because Joshua Calvert knows the mechanics of the Alchemist he must not risk death due to the event his soul is brought back in a different body and is tortured/interrogated by the possessed about his knowledge of the Alchemist. After thoroughly debriefing the crew, the First Admiral allows them to travel on to Tranquillity. A meeting is held and Ione proposes that Tranquillity and the Jovian Consensus join forces to track down the Tyrathca Sleeping God and see what use it could be in the fight with the possessed. Syrinx and the voidhawk Oenone volunteer for the mission and Joshua Calvert agrees to take the Lady Macbeth on the mission. The Confederation Navy and the Kulu ESA also agree to support the venture. Because the mission will involve travelling several thousand light-years far outside Confederation territory, Lady Macbeth is authorised to use antimatter on this mission. The Confederation Navy has located the antimatter production facility that is fuelling Capone's Organisation. They allow Lady Macbeth to fuel up and then destroy it. The Organisation hellhawk Stryla observes the attack and notes that the Lady Macbeth jumped to the Tyrathca prime colony world in Confederation space, and delivers that information to the Organisation. Several Organisation ships are despatched to pursue and investigate. On Ombey, the Liberation Campaign begins with a massive assault on Mortonridge by tens of thousands of regular troops and Edenist bitek soldiers. Although the campaign is costly, ground is won and thousands of the possessed are forcibly ejected from their hosts. Eventually the possessed fall back on a small patch of land at the tip of the peninsula and by combining their energistic powers are able to teleport the entire patch of land into a strange grey realm. The possessed and the attacking soldiers agree to a truce until they can work out how to survive in this strange place. The Valisk habitat is trapped in yet another realm, nicknamed \\"the dark continuum\\". Energistic power is weak in this place, and entropic decay is far more powerful than normal. As a result, Valisk's energy is being lost into the 'dark continuum', as it has been named. Even worse, what energy it does manage to generate attracts the attention of monstrous, immortal, shape-shifting predators known as Orgath√©, who attack the habitat with enthusiasm to feed on its power. There is a gravitational incline in this dimension which leads to a horrifying place called the M√©lange, a liquid nitrogen-cold sea of beings trapped in this continuum, unable to accumulate enough energy to escape. Dariat escapes from Valisk in an escape pod with Tolton before it hits the M√©lange and explodes, but they ponder that it is only a matter of time until the pod runs out of fuel and dissolves, forcing them to join the tortured beings outside. The Confederation Navy research team discovers a possible way of killing the possessed, an 'anti- memory' device that will eradicate both the possessed and the possessing soul. The First Admiral is horrified about the weapon and even more horrified when President Haakar, panicking as the possession crisis spreads to more worlds, authorises its development. The scientists hope to create a more powerful version that will obliterate all of the tens of billions of souls in the beyond, which becomes a controversial idea among the Confederation government. Although the first weapon is completed, further research is suspended when a lone Organisation suicide attacker detonates an antimatter bomb right outside the habitat, irradiating it and destroying dozens of ships outside. The internal staff survive, but have to transfer their personnel and equipment to Avon. Furious, the First Admiral orders that the Organisation be permanently eradicated. A fleet of over a thousand Confederation warships mobilises and attacks the worlds the Organisation have conquered, forcing them to withdraw back to New California. The other worlds, freed from the need to supply the Organisation with materials, are shifted out of the universe by their possessed populations. Joshua Calvert and Syrinx begin their search for the Sleeping God by visiting the only known Tyrathca planet in the Confederation, breaking into the abandoned arkship in orbit around the planet, to determine the origin of the Tyrathca, whose original home planet appears to be on the far side of the Orion Nebula. On the way, however, the Tyrathca break into the arkship as well and pursue the expeditionary team, who also find evidence in the arkship's systems of prior use by the Kiint. The humans manage to escape by duplicating the manoeuvre of the blackhawk Udat, swallowing into a hollow chamber in the arkship and swallowing out again to extricate the expeditionary team. On Earth, Louise Kavanagh returns to London after warning Banneth of Quinn Dexter's intention of killing her. It is eventually revealed that Quinn's actions had been discovered by a secret Govcentral security council named B7. They are in contact with Banneth and attempt to use her as bait, to lure Dexter out of hiding and then hit the building he is in with an orbital gamma laser. Quinn sees through their trap though, and arranges for a double of himself to be in the building while it is destroyed, thereby killing Banneth and the double, and making B7 think he is dead. His plan is foiled, though, by a person calling himself \\"a friend of Carter McBride\\" (the boy Laton killed to expose Quinn's cult on Lalonde), and B7 is once again on Quinn's tracks. Louise is summoned by a member of B7, the Western Europe Supervisor. He reveals to her the truth about B7: it is a consortium of incredibly wealthy individuals whose \\"financial institutions own a healthy percentage of the human race\\". They believe themselves to be immortal, as they use affinity to transfer their memories and personality into clone bodies to avoid death, in much the same way as Edenists (although the Kiint reveal that souls are different from \\"memory constructs\\", and that therefore they actually died every time their old bodies were destroyed, with their souls moving on). He also reveals that they were the actual cause behind the schism between Adamists and Edenists, which began as their attempt to keep bitek technology all for themselves (a plan that was foiled when Wing-Tsit Chong created Edenism). He arranges for Louise to meet up with Fletcher Christian in London. From there they would find Dexter and use the anti-memory device to kill him forever. The operation fails, and Louise finally confronts Quinn at St Paul's Cathedral in London, where he attempts to bring the Night to the Universe by opening a dimensional rift to summon \\"fallen angels\\" to Earth. The first creatures to emerge from it are none other than Dariat and Tolton (as the rift turns out to lead directly into the M√©lange). A confrontation ensues, with Louise, Fletcher, Dariat, Tolton, and a returned-from-the-beyond Powell Manani (the friend of Carter McBride) faced off against the army of the possessed and the entities fleeing the M√©lange. The Lady Macbeth and Oenone continue on to the Tyrathca home system, now swallowed by a red giant. At first they believe the system is uninhabited, until they catch sight of dozens of habitats ringing the Red Giant. They contact the nearest and make contact with the Mosdva, who turn out to have once been the Tyrathca's slaves, being used to mine and build the ships and habitats since they were more versatile in zero gravity. The Lady Macbeth's arrival leads to a war breaking out amongst the dominions on the habitat, which ends when they gain a Tyrathca star map, and give the dominions their FTL technology. After a lengthy journey they find the Sleeping God, a naked singularity supplied by controlling vacuum energy. The Sleeping God was originally created to remove its creator race from the current universe, and was built to help sentient entities. It reveals, among other things, that souls remain trapped in the beyond because they are unable to accept their death; all souls are indeed destined for the Beyond, but those that let go travel through the time of the spaceless dimension to the \\"omega point\\", the end of the Universe where all souls combine into one and contribute to the nature of the next universe to be born. Joshua Calvert uses the god to return every stolen Confederation planet to the Universe, before moving them out of the Galaxy, altering the wormholes to remove the possessed. He also makes Quinn into a vessel for all of the human souls in the beyond, to transport them all to the Omega point instead of letting them suffer in eternal purgatory. He then gives himself affinity and returns to Tranquility, marries young girl Louise and settles down to live on Norfolk. Numerous plot strands are also tied up in the closing pages, revealing Dariat's reunion with Anastasia in some unknown realm, the fate of the members of B7 and Andre Duchamp (who Joshua ironically strands on a penal planet), Ralph Hiltch's 'conversion' to Edenism, Syrinx reawakening Erik Thakrar and the settling of the Hiltons on Norfolk.

The members of the band label themselves as \\"melodic folk metal.\\" Band history =Formation, demos and Ensiferum (1995‚àí2002)= Ensiferum was founded in 1995 by Markus Toivonen (guitar), Sauli Savolainen (bass) and Kimmo Miettinen (drums). In the next year, Jari M√§enp√§√§ was taken into the band as singer and second guitar-player. In 1997, the first demo was released, containing three songs. The highly stylized logo of Ensiferum has appeared on all of their releases. Guitarist Markus Toivonen at Rockharz 2016 Ex-accordionist Netta Skog at Rockharz 2016 In 1998, Savolainen and Miettinen left the band and were replaced by Jukka-Pekka Miettinen (Kimmo Miettinen's little brother, then 14 years old) and Oliver Fokin. In January 1999, a second demo was recorded, which although it did not produce a recording deal, boosted the band's confidence. In November 1999 a third demo Hero in a Dream was recorded, and was successful in obtaining a record deal with Spinefarm Records. The logo that appears on all the band's releases was designed for the third demo by Tuomas Tahvanainen, who also designed the logos for the earlier demos. In 2000, the band went into the studio to work on their first album, Ensiferum, which was released in August 2001. In the same year, Meiju Enho joined them as a keyboard-player. =Iron, Line-up changes, Dragonheads and 10th Anniversary Live (2003‚àí2006)= In 2004, after the work was completed on the second album, Iron, M√§enp√§√§ left the band due to conflicts between scheduled studio work on his side project Wintersun and touring with Ensiferum. For the tour with Finntroll, Petri Lindroos from Norther replaced M√§enp√§√§ on guitar and as singer, and became a member of the band after the tour. In December 2004, Jukka-Pekka Miettinen left the band and was replaced by Sami Hinkka (Rapture). Fokin also left in 2005 to be replaced by Janne Parviainen. The new Ensiferum line-up entered the studio later that year to record an EP to be called Dragonheads, which was released in February 2006. As well as the title track, it also contained two reworked demo songs; an Amorphis cover and a short rendition of the Kalevala melody, as well as a medley of three traditional Finnish songs. In June 2006, Ensiferum released their live DVD, 10th Anniversary Live, which was recorded in Nosturi, Helsinki, on 31 December 2005. =Victory Songs and Meiju's departure (2006‚àí2009)= The recording of the third studio album, called Victory Songs, took place between November 2006 and early 2007, and was released on 20 April 2007. A single titled \\"One More Magic Potion\\" (after the track of the same name) was released on 7 February. Following the album's release, the band released through the producer's MySpace page, a music video for the song \\"Ahti,\\" which included all band members featured as extras. The video was released after the album release due to video filming problems. On 10 September 2007, it was announced that keyboardist Meiju Enho would leave the band. This was posted in a bulletin on their MySpace page and later confirmed on their website. The band used Emmi Silvennoinen of Exsecratus as a touring fill-in. Silvennoinen later became a permanent member of the band during the recording of the From Afar album. Ensiferum headlined the Paganfest tour in Europe and North America in 2008. Others playing the tour included T√Ωr and Eluveitie, with Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani also joining them on the European part of the tour, and Turisas in North America. They also supported Megadeth on the opening night of their United Abominations ‚Äì Tour of Duty European tour. Ensiferum also supported Amon Amarth on their North American Twilight of the Thunder God tour. Shortly before their Russian tour in 2008, Lindroos fell \\"seriously ill\\" and was unable to participate. The band hired ex-bassist Jukka-Pekka Miettinen to assume Lindroos' guitar duties, while bassist Sami Hinkka took over his lead vocal duties for the tour. In the first half of 2009, Ensiferum performed at a string of festivals including Frostrock in Belgium, Finnish Metal Expo and Tuska Open Air in Finland, Winterfire, Rocktower, Legacy and Rock am H√§rtsfeldsee in Germany, Summer Nights in Austria, and Z7 Metal Dayz in Switzerland. In June and July they toured North America as part of the Summer Slaughter Tour with Necrophagist, Darkest Hour, Suffocation, Blackguard, Dying Fetus, Beneath the Massacre, Origin, and Winds of Plague. In August they performed at the Global East Rock Festival in Ukraine, Ankkarock and Jurassic Rock in Finland, and Let's Open Air in Turkey. = From Afar and Unsung Heroes (2009‚àí2012) = Ensiferum released their fourth studio album, From Afar, on 9 September 2009 with Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Nightwish producer Tero Kinnunen and Victory Songs producer Janne Joutsenniemi, and it was mixed by producer Hiili Hiilesmaa. The limited edition of the album includes a cover of Swedish folk rock group Nordman with guest vocalist Heri Joensen of Faroese band T√Ωr. Following the release, the group embarked on a European tour with Estonian folk metal band Metsat√∂ll and Finnish melodic death metal band Tracedawn. In October they performed at Hellflame Festival ‚Äì The South Side of Hell and Devil's Revenge festival in Germany, and Tattoo the Mind in France. Ensiferum performed on the second day of the inaugural Screamfest Festival in Sydney, Australia, on New Years Day 2010. In November/December they toured North America with Ex Deo (on selected dates), and Blackguard. Ensiferum were also confirmed to play Bloodstock Open Air at Catton Hall, United Kingdom in 2010. In October 2010, Ensiferum embarked on their first ever South African tour. This tour consisted of four shows in two cities, and they were accompanied by numerous local metal bands including Riddare av Koden, Empery and All Forlorn. The final show, at The Black Dahlia in Johannesburg, was filmed to potentially appear on their next live DVD. In early 2011 Ensiferum embarked on The Ugly World Tour 2011 with labelmates Children of Bodom, Amon Amarth, Machinae Supremacy supporting them for segments of their tour in the US and Canada. The tour took place within a 4-month period of time and spanned 23 countries. The band's fifth studio album, Unsung Heroes, was released on 24 August 2012. It's also their final album for Spinefarm Records. The next year, Ensiferum signed with Metal Blade Records after thirteen years with their previous label. After release of the album, Ensiferum embarked on a tour of Europe and South America. = New Label, One Man Army, and Two Paths (2013‚àí2019) = Ensiferum's sixth album, One Man Army, was released on 20 February 2015. The album was recorded at Astia Studio with producer Anssi Kippo. A music video for the title track \\"One Man Army\\" was released prior to the album's release. In March of that year, Ensiferum announced on their Facebook page that keyboardist Emmi Silvennoinen would not be able to make the European and North American \\"One Man Army Tour\\" due to personal commitments at home. Former Turisas accordion player Netta Skog filled her role for the tour. Skog had performed clean vocals on the One Man Army songs \\"Cry for the Earth Bounds\\" and \\"Neito Pohjolan\\". Heri Joensen of T√Ωr makes an appearance on the track \\"Heathen Horde\\", quoting stanza 16 of H√°vam√°l in Old Icelandic. On 31 March 2016 it was announced that Emmi Silvennoinen would take a leave of absence from the band because of personal issues. Netta Skog was confirmed as her permanent replacement. With Skog in the line-up, the band entered the studio to record their seventh studio album, Two Paths. Anssi Kippo, who had produced One Man Army, was again chosen to produce the album. The band focused on a more \\"organic\\" sound for Two Paths, using analog recording and neglecting to use a click track for certain songs. Two Paths was released on 15 September 2017. Skog left the band in December 2017.

History  Aboriginal music has been present in Alberta since the end of the last ice age, nearly 10,000 years ago in Southern Alberta, around 8,000 year ago in the North. Aboriginal instruments in this part of North American were limited to the voice and the easily made and portable drum. During the fur trade, European fur traders (mostly Orcadian Scots and French-Canadians) added a variety of their own instruments, such as the guitar and the accordion, but most importantly the fiddle. The fiddle became the basis of a distinctive style used in the Western fur trade and associated with the M√©tis people in particular. In his memoir Buffalo Days and Nights, respected M√©tis guide and interpreter Peter Erasmus writes that French M√©tis fiddlers from Lac Ste. Anne played for the Christmas celebrations at Fort Edmonton in 1856. This tradition persisted even after Ontarian and European immigration began to increase after 1870.

It is widely regarded as one of the company's best works. Trinity was included as one of the titles in the 2010 book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. The plot blends historical and fantastic elements as part of a prose poem regarding the destructive power of the atomic bomb and the futile nature of war in the atomic age. The name refers to the Trinity test, the first nuclear explosion, which took place in July 1945. It is Infocom's twentieth game and the last game released by the company when it was solvent.  Plot  As the game begins, the player's character is spending a final day of a London vacation in the Kensington Gardens. The evening flight back to the United States is looking increasingly unlikely for a number of unusual reasons. Hordes of nannies are blocking all exits from the Gardens, and the grass actively resists efforts to be walked upon. Worst of all, a gleam on the horizon soon heralds the unwelcome arrival of a Soviet nuclear missile. Time begins to slow as the missile approaches, and with some ingenuity the player's character finds an incongruous door hovering in mid-air. There's no telling where it may lead, but it cannot possibly be worse than the alternative of being at ground zero of a nuclear detonation... The doorway leads to a strange land, where impossible objects exist. Space and time do not seem to behave in the familiar ways here. Exploring this new environment, the player finds several other mysterious doors, each of which leads to another chapter in the history of nuclear weaponry. After visiting test sites (including ones in Siberia, Nevada, and the Eniwetok Atoll) and Nagasaki just before each device is detonated, the player has one scenario left to deal with. The final door leads to the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, mere minutes before the test-firing that will change the course of history. But something is wrong at the \\"Trinity\\" site, and without the player's intervention things will go horribly awry. The player is witness to, or rather narrowly escapes being a witness to, a number of nuclear explosions in the game. The sites visited, and the markings on the sundial that represent them, are: * London, near future (fictional, Omega) * Low Earth Orbit, near future (fictional, Mercury) * Nevada (underground), 1970 (historical, Pluto) * Eniwetok Atoll, Pacific Ocean, 1952 (historical, Neptune) * Siberia, 1949 (historical, Libra) * Nagasaki, Japan, 1945 (historical, Mars) * Trinity, New Mexico, 1945 (historical, Alpha) Each of the symbols has a meaning relevant to the incident it represents. Trinity was the site of the first explosion, and is therefore represented by an alpha, which is the first character of the Greek alphabet. The bombing of Nagasaki was an act of war, and Mars is the Roman god of war. The test in Siberia (actually in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic) was an example of another superpower attempting to establish balance in the nuclear arms race, and the zodiacal sign of Libra is represented by the scales, making a reference to restoring the balance. The Eniwetok Atoll test took place in the middle of the ocean; hence it is symbolized by Neptune, the Roman god of the sea. The Nevada test is underground, and thus represented by Pluto, god of the underworld. The fictional incident in London was chronologically the latest to take place, and omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet. The symbols also appear at the corresponding locations in The Illustrated Story of the Atom Bomb comic, which was included with the game. The fictional Low Earth Orbit (Mercury) detonation is very likely a reference to the space interceptor subproject of the Strategic Defense Initiative, nicknamed \\"Star Wars\\", contemporary with the game's development. Trinity also includes numerous references to British children's literature, including the Alice books of Lewis Carroll, the Mary Poppins books of P.L. Travers, and especially J.M. Barrie's novel The Little White Bird. Development Brian Moriarty created Trinitys story in 1983. After joining Infocom in 1984 he proposed it to the company, but management believed that it was too large for the z-machine at the time. After completing Wishbringer Moriarty began working on Trinity in May 1985, researching the history of nuclear weapons and visiting the Trinity site and Los Alamos, New Mexico. He attempted to make the game accurately depict the geography of New Mexico and Kensington Gardens. Moriarty completed the game in June 1986, and later stated that \\"writing it wasn't a pleasant experience, I can tell you that. It's not easy to sit down and write that stuff ... It was hard to live with that game for a year\\". He added, however, that \\"Trinity is not a funeral, and [don't] be afraid of it. It's kind of a dark game, but it's also, I like to think, kind of a fun game, too. But I do want people to think about what they see.\\" Release The packaging for Trinity contained several items, called feelies, related to the plot of the game. These feelies included: * A map of the Trinity site * A cardboard sundial marked with odd symbols * The Illustrated Story of the Atom Bomb, an \\"educational\\" comic book laden with ironic statements regarding the feelings of patriotism, idealism, and jingoism surrounding the production of atomic weaponry * Instructions on how to fold an origami crane (orizuru) using the Yoshizawa‚ÄìRandlett system (a reference to Sadako Sasaki), and a small square of origami paper with which to do it. Reception In 1996, Next Generation listed Trinity at number 100 in their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\", commenting that \\"Trinity takes the same types of serious themes of A Mind Forever Voyaging, and adds to them a heavy dose of mythology and fantasy. ... this is not only one of the most socially and politically powerful game experiences ever created, but also a landscape upon which puzzles of trademark Infocom quality can appear.\\" Later the same year, Computer Gaming World listed Trinity at #120 among their top 150 best games of all-time. The editors called it \\"a tense, ethical tightrope walk through the Cold War\\". Video game designer and programmer Jonathan Blow mentions Trinity as one of his formative influences.

The strip first appeared in the Tiger in 1954, before giving its name to a weekly (and later monthly) comic, published by IPC and Fleetway from 1976 until 1995, in which it was the main feature. The weekly strip ran until 1993, following Roy's playing career until its conclusion after he lost his left foot in a helicopter crash. When the monthly comic was launched later that year the focus switched to Roy's son Rocky, who also played for Melchester. This publication was short-lived, and folded after only 19 issues. The adventures of the Race family were subsequently featured in the monthly Match of the Day football magazine, in which father and son were reunited as manager and player respectively. These strips began in 1997 and continued until the magazine's closure in May 2001. In 2018, following the acquisition of the strip's rights by comic book publisher Rebellion, a brand new rebooted Roy of the Rovers story, following the adventures of a 16-year- old Roy in the present day, began publication as a series of original graphic novels and prose novels. Football-themed stories were a staple of British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most popular. The strip usually saw Rovers competing for honours at the top of the English and European game, although in some years the storylines would see the club struggle for form, including a relegation from the First Division in the early 1980s. As well as dealing in on-pitch action, Roy of the Rovers featured high drama off the pitch, with kidnapping storylines a recurring feature of its early decades. From the 1970s onwards, stories included a shooting, a terrorist atrocity, and several celebrity guest appearances. Rovers played in a fictional universe made up of invented teams; however, real-life players including Emlyn Hughes, Bob Wilson and Malcolm Macdonald made appearances in the strip, as did former England manager Alf Ramsey. The stock media phrase \\"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark. Publication history Roy of the Rovers first appeared on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine Tiger, debuting on the front page of the first issue. After 22 years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous Roy of the Rovers, launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851 issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At the peak of the comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now defunct Today newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of the Rovers monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories. Following the closure of the weekly title in 1993,\\"Roy of the Rovers sent off\\" (The Times, 16 February 1993) the strip appeared in a relaunched monthly publication in September that year, with grittier storylines intended to attract teen and young adult fans who had read the weekly comic in their youth. Between January 1994 and January 1995, the monthly strips were mirrored by a weekly edition in Shoot magazine, which had in the late 1980s published a parody called Ray of the Rangers. The comic strip was resurrected in July 1997, printed as short (usually two-page) features in the BBC's monthly Match of the Day magazine. These strips ran until the magazine's demise in May 2001. By then the strip's wholesome tone, often espousing the virtues of fair play and strong moral character, was beginning to seem old-fashioned. The editor of Roy of the Rovers comic, Barrie Tomlinson, has commented that \\"everyone seemed to be growing up a bit more quickly, and they wanted stories that were more realistic\\". This series ran until 2001. Then-rights holder Egmont published a 64-page \\"collectors edition\\" of the comic strip in April 2009, gathering together a number of 1980's era Roy of the Rovers stories in addition to other backup strips from the comic. Two Best of Roy of the Rovers books, featuring successive runs of strips from the 1980s and 1970s, were published in June 2008 and 2009 respectively. In 2016, the rights to Roy of the Rovers and the rest of the Fleetway comics library were acquired by Rebellion Developments, who subsequently rebooted the series to follow the modern day adventures of Roy as a teenager. A series of hardcover graphic novels began publication in 2018, written by Rob Williams and drawn by Ben Willsher, running in parallel with a series of novels for younger readers written by Tom Palmer with illustrations by Lisa Henke. Plot The first ever appearance of a youthful Roy Race The story followed Roy Race, a striker for the fictional football team Melchester Rovers, based in a town of the same name in an unspecified part of England, where Roy lived with his family. In the first episode, a teenaged Roy and his best friend, Blackie Gray, signed for the Rovers after being spotted playing for a youth club team. Eight months later, Roy and Blackie made their first-team debuts against Elbury Wanderers in a game that ended in a 3‚Äì3 draw, with Roy scoring twice. He soon became a star, leading the team to either the Football League title or a cup almost every season. In January 1975 he was made player- manager, a position he retained for most of the next 20 years. Although the strip followed the Rovers through nearly 40 seasons, Roy did not age at the same rate and appeared to be at most in his late thirties by the time the weekly comic ended. This unrealistic longevity was never remarked upon by the weekly comic, although the monthly comic attempted to address the anomaly by explaining that more than one Roy Race had played for Melchester over the years. Roy won a number of trophies during his career with Rovers, including nine league titles, eight FA Cups, three League Cups, three European Cups, one UEFA Cup, and four Cup Winners' Cups, and he also made several appearances for England. He married club secretary Penny Laine at the end of the 1975‚Äì76 season, with whom he had three children: Roy Jr. (later known as Rocky), Melinda, and Diana. Penny left Roy in the early 1980s, in a high-profile storyline that was covered on national television news. The following year Roy was shot in his office by a mystery gunman, in an incident clearly mirroring the shooting of J. R. Ewing in the hit television series Dallas the previous year. Roy lay in a coma for several weeks. The culprit was eventually revealed to be Elton Blake, an actor who had been cast as Roy in a television series about the Rovers, but who blamed him for his dismissal. In early 1983 Roy swapped Melchester Rovers for ambitious London side Walford Rovers after a fallout with the Melchester directors, but his stint away was short-lived and he was back at his spiritual home by the end of the year. In July 1986 eight members of the Rovers team were killed during a club tour of the fictional Middle Eastern country of Basran, when terrorists accidentally crashed a bomb- laden car into the team bus. Roy escaped with a dislocated shoulder. Author Mick Collins has commented that \\"Even as youngsters, we knew that this certainly bordered on bad taste, and probably overstepped the mark.\\" The cover of the 19 July 1986 issue of the comic showed the aftermath of the \\"massacre\\" of the Melchester team in the fictional country of Basran. This storyline's depiction of Middle Eastern terrorists caused controversy at the time of publication. The final incident of Roy's playing career came in the closing pages of the last weekly issue, in March 1993, when he lost control of his helicopter and crashed into a field. Thus the weekly strip ended its 39-year unbroken run on a downbeat and unresolved cliffhanger, as Roy was taken into hospital while fans, the media and his family awaited news on his condition. The mystery of whether or not Roy had survived his crash was unresolved until the first issue of the new Roy of the Rovers Monthly in September 1993, in which readers discovered that the accident had resulted in the amputation of his famous left foot, ending his playing career and resulting in his move to Italy as the manager of Serie A side AC Monza (a fictional top-level Italian club, rather than the real club of the same name). Reconciling the continuity of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as retroactive continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to a more realistic level. By the time the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, on the verge of bankruptcy, and their long-term future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic thread of the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved. Roy was persuaded to rejoin Melchester as manager and part-owner, backed by the unscrupulous Vinter brothers, and he arrived just in time to save the club from relegation. The following season, Roy and Rocky resolved their differences. Rocky rejoined Melchester, and the club was promoted back into the Premier League at the end of the year. When the magazine closed in 2001, Rovers were attempting to achieve a league placing that would secure them UEFA Champions League football, giving them financial security. Although this storyline was never resolved, there was nevertheless a certain sense of closure as, shortly beforehand, Roy Sr. had wrested full control of the club from the Vinters, thus completing his 44-year progression from player to owner. = 2018 revival = The 2018 revival series of graphic novels and younger reader novels follows 16-year-old Roy Race as he attempts to earn a trial at Melchester Rovers, a once-proud club who now sit down in League One. Roy divides his time between college and looking after his disabled father, but dreams of playing for Melchester as a striker. He impresses Melchester manager Kevin \\"Mighty\\" Mouse and coach Johnny \\"Hard Man\\" Dexter at his trial, and is signed on as a trainee - but finds himself, along with the rest of the youth team, promoted to the first team squad when the club's entire roster of professional players are sold to ensure Melchester's financial survival. The first season follows Roy and the Melchester squad as they strive to qualify for the play-offs and gain promotion to the Championship. Along with Mouse and Dexter, several other characters from Roy of the Rovers history are repurposed for the reboot, including goalkeeper Gordon Stewart (formerly the star of backup series The Safest Hands in Soccer), club captain Vic Guthrie (a Welsh under-17 star and Roy's main rival in the series), towering central defender Lofty Peak (brought to Rovers by his friend Roy after showing his prowess playing basketball) and Roy's childhood friend William \\"Blackie\\" Gray, who joins Rovers on loan from Premier League side Islington. New characters created for the series include Roy's younger sister Roxanne, nicknamed \\"Rocky\\" (a homage to Roy's son from the original series) and Vic Guthrie's sister Ffion. Recurring characteristics Over the years, the strip became famous for its employment of certain types of storyline and stylistic storytelling devices. For example, despite the fast-paced nature of a football match, exposition would be provided by members of the crowd apparently commenting to one another. Fans made lengthy comments in the short time it took the ball to travel through the air; as the ball was struck towards the goal a member of the crowd might be seen saying \\"Racey's had a shot!\\", followed by another responding \\"The 'keeper won't make it!\\". Nonetheless, loyal readers would usually suspend disbelief, a characteristic later parodied by Viz magazine's Billy the Fish, a fish with a human head who plays in goal for Fulchester United. In the interests of keeping the strip exciting, it seemed that no season for Melchester Rovers could ever consist of mid-table obscurity. Almost every year, the club was either competing for the major honours at the top of the domestic and European game, or struggling against relegation to lower divisions. Often, such spells of good and bad fortune and form would directly succeed one another‚Äîa Rovers team that won the European Cup one year could find itself struggling to stay in Division One the next. Storylines often centred on new signings who were unable to settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and expected the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that made it difficult for the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times. When playing foreign teams, particularly in the European club competitions, the opposition would often cynically employ overt gamesmanship or downright dirty tactics. Continental sides were considered to be \\"sneaky\\": Sky in 1992 The strip followed the structure of the football season, thus there were several months each year when the Rovers were not playing football, but the strip needed to depict something more exciting than the players going on holiday and then reporting for pre-season training. As a result, the players tended to spend their summers involved in activities such as competing in charity cricket tournaments, but by far the most common summer storyline saw the Rovers go on tour to a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, normally South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. \\"Melchester played more pre-season games at gunpoint deep in the jungle than they ever did in more mundane settings.\\" The summer would often also see Roy fending off lucrative offers to leave Melchester, as in 1978, when the Sheik of Basran, an oil-rich Middle- Eastern state, offered him ¬£1 million to coach the national team. Especially during the 1980s, real-life personalities often made appearances. Former Division One stars Bob Wilson and Emlyn Hughes were brought out of retirement to play for Melchester in 1985, along with longtime fans of the strip Martin Kemp and Steve Norman, of the pop group Spandau Ballet. Geoff Boycott served for several years as Melchester's chairman, and Sir Alf Ramsey had briefly taken over as manager of Melchester in 1982, while Roy lay in his coma. Players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis would sometimes line up alongside Roy in England matches, despite the fact that the clubs they played for in real life were never featured in the strip. The concept of TV pundits and anchormen making appearances was a later development. When Roy announced his resignation as Rovers manager in 1992, he did so live on Sky Sports in front of shocked presenters Richard Keys and Andy Gray. Creators =Writers= Roy was created by the author Frank S. Pepper, who had created the similar strip, Danny of the Dazzlers, but he only wrote four instalments of Roy of the Rovers, because of his commitments to another of his characters, Captain Condor. His role was taken by the strip's first artist Joe Colquhoun, who used the pen-name \\"Stewart Colwyn\\". He was replaced after four-and-a-half years by Derek Birnage, the editor of Tiger, who had commissioned the strip. In 1960, in an attempt to whip up publicity, it was announced that the footballer Bobby Charlton had taken over as writer, although in reality it was still written by Birnage (who claimed that he did consult with Charlton occasionally for story ideas). The longest-serving writer of the strip was Tom Tully, who began in 1969 on an intermittent basis and then continuously from 1974 until the end of the weekly comic in 1993. Ian Rimmer became the main writer for the strip during the Match of the Day years, until the magazine's closure in May 2001. The 2018 reboot is written by Rob Williams (graphic novels) and Tom Palmer (novels). =Artists= After Joe Colquhoun departed, he was succeeded first by Paul Trevillion, then by Yvonne Hutton, who illustrated from 1967 to 1974, before David Sque took over in 1975. Despite reportedly not being a football fan, he was responsible for one of the strip's more definitive looks in its early '80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former 2000 AD artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style quite similar to White's.Rob Davis on Roy of the Rovers Monthly, Dinlos and Skilldos, 19 March 2009 A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip's creative team. Tony Harding often illustrated Roy for the Roy of the Rovers annuals and also drew the Roy's Action Replay strip that appeared in All Action Monthly in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the Match of the Day strips for all four years. The rebooted graphic novels that began publication in 2018 are drawn by Ben Willsher, while Lisa Henke illustrates the prose novels. Cultural impact The phrase \\"Roy of the Rovers\\" has become a trope familiar to generations of British football fans and sports commentators, used to describe a memorable sporting achievement such as winning against the odds, or an unexpected comeback. The Guardian newspaper of 10 April 1995, for instance, described future England captain Alan Shearer as \\"the classic working class sporting hero ... everything legend demands an English centre-forward should be ... As a striker he comes closer to fitting the Roy of the Rovers fantasy than anyone else lately admired by English crowds\\". Shearer was at that time the leading goal-scorer for \\"unfashionable\\" Blackburn Rovers F.C., who were on the verge of winning the Premiership title. Comparisons have been drawn between the fictional Roy Race and the captain of England's 1966 World Cup winning team, Bobby Moore, whose playing career spanned a similar time-scale to that of Roy's. Moore's death in 1993, just days after the last edition of the Roy of the Rovers comic was published, produced a \\"literature of tribute\\", framed around themes \\"remarkably similar to those at the center of the Roy Race fiction and ideology ... there was a clear sense of mourning for the loss of an age\\". Spin-offs and merchandise Roy of the Rovers Annuals were produced every year from 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie- in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers never made the leap from page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, in the form of a cardboard cut-out.ArchivedArchived from the original http://www.royoftherovers.com/backpage.htm on 10 October 2006. A Roy of the Rovers computer game was released, on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988. It was split into two parts: the first an adventure game, in which ‚Äì taking the role of Roy Race ‚Äì the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match to raise funds for the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team who could take part. In the extreme, Roy would be the only player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 from Your Sinclair, but only 3/10 from Sinclair User. A number of official Melchester Rovers Subbuteo teams were produced in the 1980s and 1990s. There was also an officially licensed board game in the 1980s, which saw players take on the role of Roy Race and manage the club. Replica Melchester Rovers shirts have been available at various stages of the series' life, up to and including a strip designed and produced by Hummel for the 2018 reboot. In 1990, \\"Roy Race\\" and footballer Gary Lineker released a single, \\"Europe United\\", described in the comic as \\"a hot rocking heavy metal rap\\", which failed to chart in the UK Top 40. The confectionery company McCowans produced a pineapple-flavoured \\"Roy of the Rovers\\" chew bar in the 1990s. Collected editions On 29 February 2008 it was announced that Titan Books had acquired worldwide book publishing rights to a range of Egmont's comic strips, including Roy of the Rovers. The first of their compilations of Roy's playing days, The Best of Roy of the Rovers: The 1980s was released in May 2008 and included the \\"Relegation\\" and \\"Who Shot Roy\\" story arcs. The Bumper Book of Roy of the Rovers was published in October 2008, and reprinted strips, articles, short stories and features taken from Roy annuals dated from 1957 to 1971. Two further titles were released in 2009, The Best of the 1970s and The Second Bumper Book, and a third Best of, focusing on the World Cup, was released in 2010.

Litigation In November, 2006, plaintiffs including Star Instruments and RC Optical Systems, manufacturers of traditional Ritchey-Chr√©tien optics and telescopes, filed a civil lawsuit against Meade, several dealerships, and other individuals in federal court (New York Southern District). The complaint was against Meade advertising their RCX400 and LX200R models as \\"Ritchey- Chr√©tien.\\" The plaintiffs claimed these models did not use true Ritchey- Chr√©tien optics and therefore Meade and its retailers were committing false advertising infringing on the plaintiff's market.Tom‚Äôs Astronomy Blog ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª The Meade Lawsuit In January 2008, Meade settled, with a \\"small\\" amount paid to the plaintiffs and the requirement to rename the affected products, not using any initials that might suggest Ritchey-Chr√©tien.Meade Instruments, Star Instruments and RC Optical Systems Agree to Settlement: Financial News ‚Äì Yahoo!

The revolt began on 22 August 1791, and ended in 1804 with the former colony's independence. It involved blacks, mulattoes, French, Spanish, and British participants‚Äîwith the ex-slave Toussaint Louverture emerging as Haiti's most charismatic hero. The revolution was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery, and ruled by non-whites and former captives. It is now widely seen as a defining moment in the history of the Atlantic World. Haiti at the beginning of the Haitian revolution in 1791. Its effects on the institution of slavery were felt throughout the Americas. The end of French rule and the abolition of slavery in the former colony was followed by a successful defense of the freedoms they won, and, with the collaboration of free persons of color, their independence from white Europeans. The revolution represented the largest slave uprising since Spartacus' unsuccessful revolt against the Roman Republic nearly 1,900 years earlier, and challenged long-held European beliefs about alleged black inferiority and about enslaved persons' ability to achieve and maintain their own freedom. The rebels' organizational capacity and tenacity under pressure inspired stories that shocked and frightened slave owners in the hemisphere. Background =Slave economy in Saint-Domingue= Much of Caribbean economic development in the 18th century was contingent on Europeans' demand for sugar. Plantation owners produced sugar as a commodity crop from cultivation of sugarcane, which required extensive labor. The colony of Saint- Domingue also had extensive coffee, cocoa, and indigo plantations, but these were smaller and less profitable than the sugar plantations.Thomas E. Weil, Jan Knippers Black, Howard I. Blustein, Kathryn T. Johnston, David S. McMorris, Frederick P. Munson, Haiti: A Country Study. (Washington, D.C.: The American University Foreign Area Handbook Series 1985). The commodity crops were traded for European goods. Starting in the 1730s, French engineers constructed complex irrigation systems to increase sugarcane production. By the 1740s Saint-Domingue, together with the British colony of Jamaica, had become the main supplier of the world's sugar. Production of sugar depended on extensive manual labor provided by enslaved Africans. An average of 600 ships engaged every year in shipping products from Saint-Domingue to Bordeaux, and the value of the colony's crops and goods was almost equal in value to all of the products shipped from the Thirteen Colonies to Great Britain. The livelihood of 1 million of the approximately 25 million people who lived in the France in 1789 depended directly upon the agricultural imports from Saint- Domingue, and several million indirectly depended upon trade from the colony to maintain their standard of living. Saint-Domingue was the most profitable French colony in the world, indeed one of the most profitable of all the European colonies in the 18th century. Slavery sustained sugar production under harsh conditions, including the unhealthy climate of the Caribbean, where diseases such as malaria (brought from Africa) and yellow fever caused high mortality. In 1787 alone, the French imported about 20,000 slaves from Africa into Saint-Domingue, while the British imported about 38,000 slaves total to all of their Caribbean colonies. The death rate from yellow fever was such that at least 50% of the slaves from Africa died within a year of arriving, so the white planters preferred to work their slaves as hard as possible while providing with them with the barest minimum of food and shelter. They calculated that it was better to get the most work out of their slaves with the lowest expense possible, since they were probably going to die of yellow fever anyway. The death rate was so high that polyandry‚Äîone woman being married to several men at the same time‚Äîdeveloped as a common form of marriage among the slaves. As slaves had no legal rights, rape by planters, their unmarried sons, or overseers was a common occurrence on the plantations. =Demographics= The planters and their families, together with the petite bourgeoisie of merchants and shopkeepers, were outnumbered by slaves by a factor of more than ten on Saint-Domingue. The largest sugar plantations and concentrations of slaves were in the north of the islands, and whites lived in fear of slave rebellion. Even by the standards of the Caribbean, the French slave masters were extremely cruel in their treatment of slaves. They used the threat and acts of physical violence to maintain control and suppress efforts at slave rebellion. When slaves left the plantations or disobeyed their masters, they were subject to whipping, or to more extreme torture such as castration or burning, the punishment being both a personal lesson and a warning for other slaves. King Louis XIV of France passed the Code Noir in 1685 in an attempt to regulate such violence and the treatment of the enslaved person in general in the colony, but masters openly and consistently broke the code. During the 18th century, local legislation reversed parts of it.Laurent Dubois, Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution. (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2004). In 1758, the planters began passing legislation restricting the rights of other groups of people until a rigid caste system was defined. Most historians classify the people of the era into three groups: The first group were white colonists, or les blancs. This group was generally subdivided into the plantation owners and a lower class of whites who often served as overseers or day laborers, artisans and shopkeepers. The second group were free persons of color, or gens de couleur libres, were usually mixed-race (sometimes referred to as mulattoes), being of both African and French descent. These gens de couleur tended to be educated and literate, and the men often served in the army or as administrators on plantations. Many were children of white planters and enslaved mothers, or free women of color. Others had purchased their freedom from their owners through the sale of their own produce or artistic works. They often received education or artisan training, and sometimes inherited freedom or property from their fathers. Some gens de couleur owned and operated their own plantations and became slave owners. The third group, outnumbering the others by a ratio of ten to one, was made up of mostly African-born slaves. A high rate of mortality among them meant that planters continually had to import new slaves. This kept their culture more African and separate from other people on the island. Many plantations had large concentrations of slaves from a particular region of Africa, and it was therefore somewhat easier for these groups to maintain elements of their culture, religion, and language. This also separated new slaves from Africa from creoles (slaves born in the colony), who already had kin networks and often had more prestigious roles on plantations and more opportunities for emancipation. Most slaves spoke a patois of the French language known as Haitian Creole, which was also used by island-born mulattoes and whites for communication with the workers. The majority of the slaves were Yoruba from what is now modern Nigeria, Fon from what is now Benin, and Kongo from the Kingdom of Kongo in what is now modern northern Angola and the western Congo. The Kongolese at 40% were the largest of the African ethnic groups represented amongst the slaves. The slaves developed their own religion, a syncretic mixture of Catholicism and West African religions known as Vodou, usually called \\"voodoo\\" in English. This belief system implicitly rejected the Africans' status as slaves. =Social conflict= Saint-Domingue was a society seething with hatred, with white colonists and black slaves frequently coming into violent conflict. The French historian Paul Fregosi wrote: \\"Whites, mulattos and blacks loathed each other. The poor whites couldn't stand the rich whites, the rich whites despised the poor whites, the middle-class whites were jealous of the aristocratic whites, the whites born in France looked down upon the locally born whites, mulattoes envied the whites, despised the blacks and were despised by the whites; free Negroes brutalized those who were still slaves, Haitian born blacks regarded those from Africa as savages. Everyone‚Äîquite rightly‚Äîlived in terror of everyone else. ...Haiti was hell, but Haiti was rich\\". Many of these conflicts involved slaves who had escaped the plantations. Many runaway slaves‚Äîcalled maroons‚Äîhid on the margins of large plantations, living off the land and what they could steal from their former masters. Others fled to towns, to blend in with urban slaves and freed blacks who often migrated to those areas for work. If caught, these runaway slaves would be severely and violently punished. However, some masters tolerated petit marronages, or short-term absences from plantations, knowing these allowed release of tensions. The larger groups of runaway slaves who lived in the hillside woods away from white control often conducted violent raids on the island's sugar and coffee plantations. Although the numbers in these bands grew large (sometimes into the thousands), they generally lacked the leadership and strategy to accomplish large-scale objectives. The first effective maroon leader to emerge was the charismatic Haitian Vodou priest Fran√ßois Mackandal, who inspired his people by drawing on African traditions and religions. He united the maroon bands and established a network of secret organizations among plantation slaves, leading a rebellion from 1751 through 1757. Although Mackandal was captured by the French and burned at the stake in 1758, large armed maroon bands persisted in raids and harassment after his death. =Slavery in Enlightenment thought= French writer Guillaume Raynal attacked slavery in his history of European colonization. He warned, \\"the Africans only want a chief, sufficiently courageous, to lead them on to vengeance and slaughter.\\"\\"Antislavery Agitation: Abbe Raynal\\", Philosophical and Political History of the Settlements and Trade of the East and West Indies (1770), accessed 8 May 2014. Raynal's Enlightenment philosophy went deeper than a prediction and reflected many similar philosophies, including those of Rousseau and Diderot. Raynal's admonition was written thirteen years before the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which highlighted freedom and liberty but did not abolish slavery. Jean-Baptiste Belley, as depicted by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson. In addition to Raynal's influence, Toussaint Louverture, a free black who was familiar with Enlightenment ideas within the context of European colonialism, would become a key \\"enlightened actor\\" in the Haitian Revolution. Enlightened thought divided the world into \\"enlightened leaders\\" and \\"ignorant masses\\";Goldmann, Lucien. The Philosophy of the Enlightenment: the Christian Burgess and the Enlightenment. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1973. Louverture sought to bridge this divide between the popular masses and the enlightened few by striking a balance between Western Enlightened thought as a necessary means of winning liberation, and not propagating the notion that it was morally superior to the experiences and knowledge of people of color on Saint-Domingue.Paul B. Miller, \\"Enlightened Hesitations: Black Masses and Tragic Heroes in C. L. R. James's The Black Jacobins\\". MLN 116: 1069‚Äì90. (accessed 8 May 2014).C. L. R. James, The Black Jacobins: Toussaint Louverture and the San Domingo Revolution, 1st ed. New York: Vintage Books, 1963. Louverture wrote a constitution for a new society in Saint-Domingue that abolished slavery. The existence of slavery in Enlightened society was an incongruity that had been left unaddressed by European scholars prior to the French Revolution. Louverture took on this inconsistency directly in his constitution. In addition, he exhibited a connection to Enlightenment scholars through the style, language, and accent What is the \\"accent\\" of a text? of this text.Miller, 1069‚Äì90. Like Louverture, Jean-Baptiste Belley was an active participant in the insurrection. The portrait of Belley by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson depicts a man who encompasses the French view of its colonies, creating a stark dichotomy between the refinement of Enlightenment thought and the reality of the situation in Saint-Domingue, through the bust of Raynald and the figure of Belley, respectively. While distinguished, the portrait still portrays a man trapped by the confines of race. Girodet's portrayal of the former National Convention deputy is telling of the French opinion of colonial citizens by emphasizing the subject's sexuality and including an earring. Both of these racially charged symbols reveal the desire to undermine the colony's attempts at independent legitimacy, as citizens of the colonies were not able to access the elite class of French Revolutionaries because of their race.Sylvia Musto, \\"Portraiture, Revolutionary Identity and Subjugation: Anne-Louis Girodet's Citizen Belley\\", RACAR: Revue d'Art Canadienne / Canadian Art Review 20 (1993): 60‚Äì71. Situation in 1789 =Social stratification= In 1789, Saint-Domingue produced 60% of the world's coffee and 40% of the sugar imported by France and Britain. The colony was not only the most profitable possession of the French colonial empire, but it was the wealthiest and most prosperous colony in the Caribbean. The colony's white population numbered 40,000; mulattoes and free blacks, 28,000; and black slaves, an estimated 452,000. This was almost half the total slave population in the Caribbean, estimated at one million that year.Herbert Klein, Transatlantic Slave Trade, pp. 32‚Äì33 Enslaved blacks, regarded as the lowest class of colonial society, outnumbered whites and free people of color by a margin of almost eight to one. Two-thirds of the slaves were African born, and they tended to be less submissive than those born in the Americas and raised in slave societies. The death rate in the Caribbean exceeded the birth rate, so imports of enslaved Africans were necessary to maintain the numbers required to work the plantations. The slave population declined at an annual rate of two to five percent, due to overwork, inadequate food and shelter, insufficient clothing and medical care, and an imbalance between the sexes, with more men than women.Tim Matthewson, A Pro-Slavery Foreign Policy: Haitian-American Relations During the Early Republic, (Praeger: Westport, CN and London: 2003) p. 3 Some slaves were of a creole elite class of urban slaves and domestics, who worked as cooks, personal servants and artisans around the plantation house. This relatively privileged class was chiefly born in the Americas, while the under- class born in Africa labored hard, and often under abusive and brutal conditions. Among Saint-Domingue's 40,000 white colonists, European-born Frenchmen monopolized administrative posts. The sugar planters, or grands blancs (literally, \\"big whites\\"), were chiefly minor aristocrats. Most returned to France as soon as possible, hoping to avoid the dreaded yellow fever, which regularly swept the colony. The lower-class whites, petits blancs (literally \\"small whites\\"), included artisans, shopkeepers, slave dealers, overseers, and day laborers. Saint-Domingue's free people of color, or gens de couleur libres, numbered more than 28,000. Around that time, colonial legislations, concerned with this growing and strengthening population, passed discriminatory laws that required these freedmen to wear distinctive clothing and limited where they could live. These laws also barred them from occupying many public offices. Many freedmen were also artisans and overseers, or domestic servants in the plantation houses.Robert Heinl, Written in Blood: The History of the Haitian People, New York: Lanham, 1996, p. 45 Le Cap Fran√ßais (Le Cap), a northern port, had a large population of free people of color, including freed slaves. These men would become important leaders in the slave rebellion and later revolution. =Regional conflicts= Saint-Domingue's Northern province was the center of shipping and trading, and had the largest population of grands blancs. The Plaine-du-Nord on the northern shore of Saint-Domingue was the most fertile area, having the largest sugar plantations and therefore the most slaves. It was the area of greatest economic importance, especially as most of the colony's trade went through these ports. The largest and busiest port was Le Cap, the former capital of Saint-Domingue. Enslaved Africans in this region lived in large groups of workers in relative isolation, separated from the rest of the colony by the high mountain range known as the Massif du Nord. The Western province, however, grew significantly after the colonial capital was moved to Port-au-Prince in 1751, becoming increasingly wealthy in the second half of the 18th century. The Southern province lagged in population and wealth because it was geographically separated from the rest of the colony. However, this isolation allowed freed slaves to find profit in trade with Jamaica, and they gained power and wealth here. In addition to these interregional tensions, there were conflicts between proponents of independence, those loyal to France, and allies of Great Britain and Spain‚Äîwho coveted control of the valuable colony. Native Americans in the Revolution The Haitian Revolution is largely known as a massive upheaval of the colonial system lead by Africans and Afro-Descendants. We‚Äôve heard stories of French abolitionists and Eastern European mercenaries joining the cause, slaves from other colonies traveling to the island to get involved, however, we rarely hear about the involvement of Indigenous groups in the war. Few pre-colonial documents make the mention of native peoples in Haiti, and the original natives that populated the island were largely eliminated or procreated with other ethnic groups. For these reasons, we don‚Äôt really recognize the involvement of the indigenous, and thus, their contributions are largely forgotten. As we know, during Spanish colonization, the Ta√≠no population was ravaged by disease and slavery. During French colonization, small groups of \\"NezPerce\\" and Natchez natives were introduced to supplement the African slave population. They were known as ‚Äúindiens esclaves‚Äù which numbered about 5,000. In a 1780 census, there was also a group listed as ‚Äúindiens sauvages‚Äù, which Haitian historians believe were the native Arawak/Ta√Øno that were known to live in tiny reclusive mountain communities at this point. Dessalines talked about people whom he called ‚ÄúRouges‚Äù (reds), or sometimes ‚ÄúIncas‚Äù in his letters. When they were spoken about in context of the war, he makes makes mention of cooperation between Africans and Natives in maroon communities that plotted against colonists on the southern peninsula. He‚Äôs also spoken about ‚ÄúIncas among his men‚Äù showing him secret burial quarters in the Artibonite valley that could be used by rebels as shelter and storage. There were 3,000 known Native peoples (both ‚Äúesclaves‚Äù and ‚Äúsauvages‚Äù) living in Haiti in the years before independence, according to a 1802 colonial census. Dessalines did not forget these people and their sacrifices against Spain and now, France. He named the Haitian army ‚Äúthe Incas‚Äù, ‚Äúthe Army of the Sun‚Äù and eventually ‚Äúthe Indigenous Army‚Äù in honor of them. He also renamed the island ‚ÄúAyiti‚Äù, it‚Äôs pre-Columbian name. Effects of the French Revolution After the establishment of the French First Republic, the National Assembly made radical changes to French laws and, on 26 August 1789, published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, declaring all men free and equal. The Declaration was ambiguous as to whether this equality applied to women, slaves, or citizens of the colonies, and thus influenced the want for freedom and equality in Saint-Domingue. White planters saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow them to take control of the island and create trade regulations that would further their own wealth and power. However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the new French republic, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their stated ideology.Blackburn, Robin. \\"The Force of Example\\". The Impact of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World. Ed. David P. Geggus. (Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press 2001). The African population on the island began to hear of the agitation for independence by the planters, who had resented France's limitations on the island's foreign trade. The Africans mostly allied with the royalists and the British, as they understood that if Saint-Domingue's independence were to be led by white slave masters, it would probably mean even harsher treatment and increased injustice for the African population. The planters would be free to operate slavery as they pleased without the existing minimal accountability to their French peers. Saint- Domingue's free people of color, most notably Julien Raimond, had been actively appealing to France for full civil equality with whites since the 1780s. Raimond used the French Revolution to make this the major colonial issue before the National Assembly. In October 1790, another wealthy free man of color, Vincent Og√©, demanded the right to vote under the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. When the colonial governor refused, Og√© led a brief 300-man insurgency in the area around Le Cap, fighting to end racial discrimination in the area. He was captured in early 1791, and brutally executed by being \\"broken on the wheel\\" before being beheaded. While Og√© was not fighting against slavery, his treatment was cited by later slave rebels as one of the factors in their decision to rise up in August 1791 and resist treaties with the colonists. The conflict up to this point was between factions of whites, and between whites and free blacks. Enslaved blacks watched from the sidelines. Leading 18th-century French writer Count Mirabeau had once said the Saint-Domingue whites \\"slept at the foot of Vesuvius\\",Hochschild, Adam Bury the Chains: The British Struggle to Abolish Slavery (2006) suggesting the grave threat they faced should the majority of slaves launch a sustained major uprising. The Revolution =Onset of the revolution= Guillaume Raynal attacked slavery in the 1780 edition of his history of European colonization. He also predicted a general slave revolt in the colonies, saying that there were signs of \\"the impending storm\\".Center and Hunt, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, 119. One such sign was the action of the French revolutionary government to grant citizenship to wealthy free people of color in May 1791. Since white planters refused to comply with this decision, within two months isolated fighting broke out between the former slaves and the whites. This added to the tense climate between slaves and grands blancs.Blackburn, \\"Haiti's Slavery in the Age of the Democratic Revolution\\", William and Mary Quarterly 63.4, 633‚Äì44 (2006). Raynal's prediction came true on the night of 21 August 1791, when the slaves of Saint- Domingue rose in revolt; thousands of slaves attended a secret vodou ceremony as a tropical storm came in‚Äîthe lighting and the thunder was taken as auspicious omens‚Äîand later that night, the slaves began to kill their masters and plunged the colony into civil war. The signal to begin the revolt was given by Dutty Boukman, a high priest of vodou and leader of the Maroon slaves, and Cecile Fatiman during a religious ceremony at Bois Ca√Øman on the night of 14 August.Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, 123. Dutty Boukman, Haitianite.com Within the next ten days, slaves had taken control of the entire Northern Province in an unprecedented slave revolt. Whites kept control of only a few isolated, fortified camps. The slaves sought revenge on their masters through \\"pillage, rape, torture, mutilation, and death\\".Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, p. 124. The long years of oppression by the planters had left many blacks with a hatred of all whites, and the revolt was marked by extreme violence from the very start. The masters and mistresses were dragged from their beds to be killed, and the heads of French children were placed on spikes that were carried at the front of the rebel columns. In the south, beginning in September, thirteen thousand slaves and rebels led by Romaine-la-Proph√©tesse, based in Trou Coffy, took supplies from and burned plantations and freed slaves and occupied (and burned) the area's two major cities, L√©og√¢ne and Jacmel.Terry Rey, The Priest and the Prophetess: Abb√© Ouvi√®re, Romaine Rivi√®re, and the Revolutionary Atlantic World (2017), pp. 28, 32‚Äì35, 48‚Äì49, 52Matthias Middell, Megan Maruschke, The French Revolution as a Moment of Respatialization (2019), p. 71.James Alexander Dun, Dangerous Neighbors: Making the Haitian Revolution (2016), p. 65David F. Marley, Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict (2008), p. 534 The planters had long feared such a revolt, and were well armed with some defensive preparations. But within weeks, the number of slaves who joined the revolt in the north reached 100,000. Within the next two months, as the violence escalated, the slaves killed 4,000 whites and burned or destroyed 180 sugar plantations and hundreds of coffee and indigo plantations. At least 900 coffee plantations were destroyed, and the total damage inflicted over the next two weeks amounted to 2 million francs. In September 1791, the surviving whites organized into militias and struck back, killing about 15,000 blacks. Though demanding freedom from slavery, the rebels did not demand independence from France at this point. Most of the rebel leaders professed to be fighting for the king of France, who they believed had issued a decree freeing the slaves, which had been suppressed by the colonial governor. As such, they were demanding their rights as Frenchmen which been granted by the king. Slave rebellion of 1791 By 1792, slave rebels controlled a third of the island. The success of the rebellion caused the National Assembly in France to realize it was facing an ominous situation. The Assembly granted civil and political rights to free men of color in the colonies in March 1792. Countries throughout Europe, as well as the United States, were shocked by the decision, but the Assembly was determined to stop the revolt. Apart from granting rights to free people of color, the Assembly dispatched 6,000 French soldiers to the island.Blackpast.com , Haitian Revolution 1791‚Äì1804 A new governor sent by Paris, L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax, abolished slavery in the Northern Province of Saint Domingue and had hostile relations with the planters, whom he saw as royalists. The same month, a coalition of whites and conservative free blacks and forces under French commissaire nationale Edmond de Saint-L√©ger put down the Trou Coffy uprising in the south,Rey (2017), pp. 137, 157‚Äì59.Jeremy D. Popkin, A Concise History of the Haitian Revolution (2011), p. 51 after Andr√© Rigaud, then based near Port-au- Prince, declined to ally with them.Rey (2017), p. 103. =Britain and Spain enter the conflict= Meanwhile, in 1793, France declared war on Great Britain. The grands blancs in Saint-Domingue, unhappy with Sonthonax, arranged with Great Britain to declare British sovereignty over the colony, believing that the British would maintain slavery. The British prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, believed that the success of the slave revolt in Saint- Domingue would inspire insurrections in the British Caribbean colonies. He further thought that taking Saint-Domingue, the richest of the French colonies, would be a useful bargaining chip in eventual peace negotiations with France, and in the interim, occupying Saint-Domingue would mean diverting its great wealth into the British treasury. The American journalist James Perry notes that the great irony of the British campaign in Saint-Domingue was that it ended as a complete debacle, costing the British treasury millions of pounds and the British military thousands upon thousands of dead, all for nothing. Spain, which controlled the rest of the island of Hispaniola, also joined the conflict and fought against France. From the beginning, Spanish Santo Domingo had encouraged disruptions in Saint-Domingue. Spanish forces invaded Saint Domingue and were joined by the rebels. For most of the conflict, the British and Spanish supplied the rebels with food, ammunition, arms, medicine, naval support, and military advisors. By August 1793, there were only 3,500 French soldiers on the island. On 20 September 1793, about 600 British soldiers from Jamaica landed at J√©r√©mie to be greeted with shouts of \\"Vivent les Anglais!\\" from the French population. On 22 September 1793, Mole St. Nicolas, the main French naval base in Saint-Domingue, surrendered to the Royal Navy peacefully. Everywhere the British went, they restored slavery, which made them hated by the mass of common people. =French declare slavery abolished= To prevent military disaster, and secure the colony for republican France as opposed to Britain, Spain, and French royalists, separately or in combination, the French commissioners L√©ger-F√©licit√© Sonthonax and √âtienne Polverel freed the slaves in Saint-Domingue in their declaration of abolition on 29 August 1793. Sonthonax sent three of his deputies, namely the colonist Louis Duffay, the free black army officer Jean- Baptiste Belley and a free man of colour, Jean-Baptiste Mills to seek the National Convention's endorsement for the emancipation of slaves near the end of January, 1794. On 4 February 1794, Dufay gave a speech to the convention arguing that abolishing slavery was the only way to keep the colony in control of the French, and that former slaves would willingly work to restore the colony. The Convention deputies agreed, and made the dramatic decree that \\"slavery of the blacks is abolished in all the colonies; consequently, it decrees that all men living in the colonies, without distinction of color, are French citizens and enjoy all the rights guaranteed by the constitution\\". It abolished slavery by law in France and all its colonies, and granted civil and political rights to all black men in the colonies. The French constitutions of 1793 and 1795 both included the abolition of slavery. The constitution of 1793 was never applied, but that of 1795 was implemented and lasted until replaced by the consular and imperial constitutions under Napoleon Bonaparte. Despite racial tensions in Saint Domingue, the French revolutionary government at the time welcomed abolition with a show of idealism and optimism. The emancipation of slaves was viewed as an example of liberty for other countries, much as the American Revolution was meant to serve as the first of many liberation movements. Georges Danton, one of the Frenchmen present at the meeting of the National Convention, expressed this sentiment: > Representatives of the French people, until now our decrees of liberty have > been selfish, and only for ourselves. But today we proclaim it to the > universe, and generations to come will glory in this decree; we are > proclaiming universal liberty ... We are working for future generations; let > us launch liberty into the colonies; the English are dead, today., Document > 26. In nationalistic terms, the abolition of slavery also served as a moral triumph of France over England, as seen in the latter half of the above quote. Yet Toussaint Louverture did not stop working with the Spanish army until sometime later, as he was suspicious of the French. The British force that landed in Saint-Domingue in 1793 was too small to conquer the place, being capable only of holding only few coastal enclaves. The French planters were disappointed as they had hoped to regain power; Sonthonax was relieved, as he had twice refused ultimatums from Commodore John Ford to surrender Port-au- Prince. In the meantime, a Spanish force under Captain-General Joaquin Garcia y Moreno had marched into the Northern Province. Toussaint Louverture, the ablest of the Haitian generals, had joined the Spanish, accepting an officer's commission in the Spanish Army and being made a knight in the Order of St. Isabella. The main British force for the conquest of Saint-Domingue under General Charles Grey, nicknamed \\"No-flint Grey\\", and Admiral Sir John Jervis set sail from Portsmouth on 26 November 1793, which was in defiance of the well-known rule that the only time that one could campaign in the West Indies was from September to November, when the mosquitoes that carried malaria and yellow fever were scarce. After arriving in the West Indies in February 1794, Grey chose to conquer Martinique, St. Lucia, and Guadeloupe. Troops under the command of John Whyte did not arrive in Saint-Domingue until 19 May 1794. Rather than attacking the main French bases at Le Cap and Port-de-Paix, Whyte chose to march towards Port-au-Prince, whose harbour was reported to have 45 ships loaded with sugar. Whyte took Port-au-Prince, but Sonthonax and the French forces were allowed to leave in exchange for not burning the 45 ships loaded with sugar. By May 1794, the French forces were severed in two by Toussaint, with Sonthonax commanding in the north and Andr√© Rigaud leading in the south. =The Spanish depart Saint Domingue= At this point, Toussaint, for reasons that remain obscure, suddenly joined the French and turned against the Spanish, ambushing his allies as they emerged from attending mass in a church at San Raphael on 6 May 1794. The Spaniards were not defeated militarily, but their advance was restrained, and when in 1795 Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France, Spanish attacks on Saint Domingue ceased. Despite being a former slave, Toussaint proved to be forgiving of the whites, insisting that he was fighting to assert the rights of the slaves as black French people to be free. He said he did not seek independence from France, and urged the surviving whites, including the former slave masters, to stay and work with him in rebuilding Saint-Domingue. Rigaud had checked the British in the south, taking the town of L√©og√¢ne by storm and driving the British back to Port-au-Prince. During the course of 1794, most of the British forces were killed by yellow fever, the dreaded \\"black vomit\\" as the British called it. Within two months of arriving in Saint-Domingue, the British had lost 40 officers and 600 men to yellow fever. Ultimately, of Grey's 7,000 men, about 5,000 were to die of yellow fever while the Royal Navy reported losing \\"forty- six masters and eleven hundred men dead, chiefly of yellow fever\\". The British historian Sir John Fortescue wrote \\"It is probably beneath the mark to say that twelve thousand Englishmen were buried in the West Indies in 1794\\". Rigaud failed in attempt to retake Port-au-Prince, but on Christmas Day 1794, he stormed and retook Tiburon in a surprise attack. The British lost about 300 dead, and the mulattoes took no prisoners, executing any British soldier and sailor who surrendered. =The British \\"great push\\"= At this point, Pitt decided to reinforce failure by launching what he called \\"the great push\\" to conquer Saint-Domingue and the rest of the French West Indies, sending out the largest expedition Britain had yet mounted in its history, a force of about 30,000 men to be carried in 200 ships. Fortescue wrote that the aim of London in the first expedition had been to destroy \\"the power of France in these pestilent islands ... only to discover when it was too late, that they practically destroyed the British army\\". By this point, it was well known that service in the West Indies was virtually a death sentence. In Dublin and Cork, soldiers from the 104th, 105th, 111th, and 112th regiments of foot rioted when they learned that they were being sent to Saint-Domingue. The fleet for the \\"great push\\" left Portsmouth on 16 November 1795 and was wrecked by a storm, before sending out again on 9 December. The overall forces in St Domingue was at that time under the command of the lieutenant-governor of Jamaica, Sir Adam Williamson.Michael Craton, Testing the Chains (New York: Cornell University Press, 1982) pp. 211-2. General Ralph Abercromby, the commander of the forces committed to the \\"great push\\", hesitated over which island to attack when he arrived in Barbados on 17 March 1796. He dispatched a force under Major General Gordon Forbes (British Army officer) to Port-au-Prince. Forbes's attempt to take the French-held city of L√©og√¢ne ended in disaster. The French had built a deep defensive ditch with palisades, while Forbes had neglected to bring along heavy artillery. The French commander, the mulatto General Alexandre P√©tion, proved to be an excellent artilleryman, who used the guns of his fort to sink two of the three ships-of-the-line under Admiral Hyde Parker in the harbour, before turning his guns to the British forces; a French sortie led to a British rout and Forbes retreating back to Port-au-Prince. As more ships arrived with British troops, more soldiers died of yellow fever. By 1 June 1796, of the 1,000 from the 66th Regiment, only 198 had not been infected with yellow fever; and of the 1,000 men of the 69th Regiment, only 515 were not infected with yellow fever. Abercromby predicted that at the current rate of yellow fever infection, all of the men from the two regiments would be dead by November. Ultimately, 10,000 British soldiers arrived in Saint Domingue by June, but besides for some skirmishing near Bombarde, the British remained put in Port-au-Prince and other coastal enclaves, while yellow fever continued to kill them all off. The government attracted much criticism in the House of Commons about the mounting costs of the expedition to Saint-Domingue. In February 1797, General John Graves Simcoe arrived to replace Forbes with orders to pull back the British forces to Port-au-Prince. As the human and financial costs of the expedition mounted, people in Britain demanded a withdrawal from Saint-Domingue, which was devouring money and soldiers, while failing to produce the expected profits. On 11 April 1797 Colonel Thomas Maitland of the 62nd Regiment of Foot landed in Port-au-Prince, and wrote in a letter to his brother that British forces in Saint-Domingue had been \\"annihilated\\" by the yellow fever. Service in Saint-Domingue was extremely unpopular in the British Army owing to the terrible death toll caused by yellow fever. One British officer wrote of his horror of seeing his friends \\"drowned in their own blood\\" while \\"some died raving Mad\\". Simcoe used the new British troops to push back the Haitians under Toussaint, but in a counter- offensive, Toussaint and Rigaud stopped the offensive. Toussaint retook the fortress at Mirebalais. On 7 June 1797, Toussaint attacked Fort Churchill in an assault that was as noted for its professionalism as for its ferocity. Under a storm of artillery, the Haitians placed ladders on the walls and were driven back four times, with heavy losses. Even though Toussaint had been defeated, the British were astonished that he had turned a group of former slaves with no military experience into troops whose skills were the equal of a European army. =British withdrawal= In July 1797, Simcoe and Maitland sailed to London to advise a total withdrawal from Saint-Domingue. In March 1798 Maitland returned with a mandate to withdraw, at least from Port-au- Prince. On 10 May 1798, Maitland met with Toussaint to agree to an armistice, and on 18 May the British had left Port-au-Prince. British morale had collapsed with the news that Toussaint had taken Port-au-Prince, and Maitland decided to abandon all of Saint-Domingue, writing that the expedition had become such a complete disaster that withdrawal was the only sensible thing to do, even through he did not have the authority to do so. On 31 August, Maitland and Toussaint signed an agreement whereby in exchange for the British pulling out of all of Saint-Domingue, Toussaint promised to not support any slave revolts in Jamaica. Between 1793 and 1798, the expedition to Saint- Domingue had cost the British treasury four million pounds and 100,000 men either dead or permanently disabled from the effects of yellow fever. =Toussaint consolidates control= After the departure of the British, Toussaint turned his attention to Rigaud, who was conspiring against him in the south of Saint Domingue. In June 1799, Rigaud initiated the War of Knives against Toussaint's rule, sending a brutal offensive at Petit-Go√¢ve and Grand- Go√¢ve. Taking no prisoners, Rigaud's predominantly mulatto forces put blacks and whites to the sword. Though the United States was hostile towards Toussaint, the U.S. Navy agreed to support Toussaint's forces with the frigate USS General Greene, commanded by Captain Christopher Perry, providing fire support to the blacks as Toussaint laid siege to the city of Jacmel, held by mulatto forces under the command of Rigaud. To the United States, Rigaud's ties to France represented a threat to American commerce. On 11 March 1800, Toussaint took Jacmel and Rigaud fled on the French schooner La Diana. Though Toussaint maintained he was still loyal to France, to all intents and purposes, he ruled Saint Domingue as its dictator. In the early 21st century, historian Robert L. Scheina estimated that the slave rebellion resulted in the death of 350,000 Haitians and 50,000 European troops. According to the Encyclopedia of African American Politics, \\"Between 1791 and independence in 1804 nearly 200,000 blacks died, as did thousands of mulattoes and as many as 100,000 French and British soldiers.\\" Yellow fever caused the most deaths. Geggus points out that at least 3 of every 5 British troops sent there in 1791‚Äì1797 died of disease.David Geggus, \\"The British Army and the Slave Revolt\\", History Today (1982) 32#7 pp. 35‚Äì39John S. Marr, and John T. Cathey. \\"The 1802 Saint-Domingue yellow fever epidemic and the Louisiana Purchase\\". Journal of Public Health Management and Practice 19#.1 (2013): 77‚Äì82. online There has been considerable debate over whether the number of deaths caused by disease was exaggerated. Leadership of Louverture General Toussaint Louverture. =Toussaint Louverture= One of the most successful black commanders was Toussaint Louverture, a self-educated former domestic slave. Like Jean Fran√ßois and Biassou, he initially fought for the Spanish crown in this period. After the British had invaded Saint-Domingue, Louverture decided to fight for the French if they would agree to free all the slaves. Sonthonax had proclaimed an end to slavery on 29 August 1792. Louverture worked with a French general, √âtienne Laveaux, to ensure that all slaves would be freed. Louverture abandoned the Spanish army in the east and brought his forces over to the French side on 6 May 1794 after the Spanish refused to take steps to end slavery. Under the military leadership of Toussaint, the forces made up mostly of former slaves succeeded in winning concessions from the British and expelling the Spanish forces. In the end, Toussaint essentially restored control of Saint-Domingue to France. Louverture was very intelligent, organized and articulate. Having made himself master of the island, however, Toussaint did not wish to surrender too much power to France. He began to rule the country as an effectively autonomous entity. Louverture overcame a succession of local rivals, including: the Commissioner Sonthonax, a French white man who gained support from many Haitians, angering Louverture; Andr√© Rigaud, a free man of color who fought to keep control of the South in the War of Knives; and Comte d'H√©douville, who forced a fatal wedge between Rigaud and Louverture before escaping to France. Toussaint defeated a British expeditionary force in 1798. In addition, he led an invasion of neighboring Santo Domingo (December 1800), and freed the slaves there on 3 January 1801. In 1801, Louverture issued a constitution for Saint-Domingue that decreed he would be governor-for-life and called for black autonomy and a sovereign black state. In response, Napoleon Bonaparte dispatched a large expeditionary force of French soldiers and warships to the island, led by Bonaparte's brother-in- law Charles Leclerc, to restore French rule. They were under secret instructions to restore slavery, at least in the formerly Spanish-held part of the island. Bonaparte ordered that Toussaint was to be treated with respect until the French forces were established; once that was done, Toussaint was to summoned to Le Cap and be arrested; if he failed to show, Leclerc was to wage \\"a war to the death\\" with no mercy and all of Toussaint's followers to be shot when captured. Once that was completed, slavery would be ultimately restored. The numerous French soldiers were accompanied by mulatto troops led by Alexandre P√©tion and Andr√© Rigaud, mulatto leaders who had been defeated by Toussaint three years earlier. =Napoleon invades Haiti= The French arrived on 2 February 1802 at Le Cap with the Haitian commander Henri Christophe being ordered by Leclerc to turn over the city to the French. When Christophe refused, the French assaulted Le Cap and the Haitians set the city afire rather than surrender it. Leclerc sent Toussaint letters promising him: \\"Have no worries about your personal fortune. It will be safeguarded for you, since it has been only too well earned by your own efforts. Do not worry about the liberty of your fellow citizens\\". When Toussaint still failed to appear at Le Cap, Leclerc issued a proclamation on 17 February 1802: \\"General Toussaint and General Christophe are outlawed; all citizens are ordered to hunt them down, and treat them as rebels against the French Republic\\". Captain Marcus Rainsford, a British Army officer who visited Saint-Domingue observed the training of the Haitian Army, writing: \\"At a whistle, a whole brigade ran three or four hundred yards, and then, separating, threw themselves flat on the ground, changing to their backs and sides, and all the time keeping up a strong fire until recalled‚Ä¶This movement is executed with such facility and precision as totally to prevent cavalry from charging them in bushy and hilly country\\". =Haitian resistance and scorched-earth tactics= In a letter to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint outlined his plans for defeating the French: \\"Do not forget, while waiting for the rainy reason which will rid us of our foes, that we have no other resource than destruction and fire. Bear in mind that the soil bathed with our sweat must not furnish our enemies with the smallest sustenance. Tear up the roads with shot; throw corpses and horses into all the foundations, burn and annihilate everything in order that those who have come to reduce us to slavery may have before their eyes the image of the hell which they deserve\\". Dessalines never received the letter as he had already taken to the field, evaded a French column sent to capture him and stormed L√©og√¢ne. The Haitians burned down L√©og√¢ne and killed all of the French with the Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James writing of Dessalines's actions at L√©og√¢ne: \\"Men, women and children, indeed all the whites who came into his hands, he massacred. And forbidding burial, he left stacks of corpses rotting in the sun to strike terror into the French detachments as they toiled behind his flying columns\\". The French had been expecting the Haitians to happily go back to being their slaves, as they believed it was natural for blacks to be the slaves of whites, and were stunned to learn how much the Haitians hated them for wanting to reduce them back to a life in chains. A visibly shocked General Pamphile de Lacroix after seeing the ruins of L√©og√¢ne wrote: \\"They heaped up bodies\\" which \\"still had their attitudes; they were bent over, their hands outstretched and beseeching; the ice of death had not effaced the look on their faces\\". Leclerc ordered four French columns to march on Gonaives, which was the main Haitian base. One of the French columns was commanded by General Donatien de Rochambeau, a proud white supremacist and a supporter of slavery who detested the Haitians for wanting to be free. Toussaint tried to stop Rochambeau at Ravine-√†-Couleuvre, a very narrow gully up in the mountains that the Haitians had filled with chopped down trees. In the ensuring Battle of Ravine-√†-Couleuvres, after six hours of fierce hand-to-hand fighting with no quarter given on either side, the French finally broke through, albeit with heavy losses. During the battle, Toussaint personally took part in the fighting to lead his men in charges against the French. After losing 800 men, Toussaint ordered a retreat. =Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot fortress= The Haitians next tried to stop the French at a British-built fort up in the mountains called Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot, a battle that is remembered as a national epic in Haiti. While Toussaint took to the field, he left Dessalines in command of Cr√™te-√†- Pierrot, who from his fastness could see three French columns converging on the fort. Dessalines appeared before his men standing atop of a barrel of gunpowder, holding a lit torch, saying: \\"We are going to be attacked, and if the French put their feet in here, I shall blow everything up\\", leading his men to reply \\"We shall die for liberty!\\". The first of the French columns to appear before the fort was commanded by General Jean Boudet, whose men were harassed by skirmishers until they reached a deep ditch the Haitians had dug. As the French tried to cross the ditch, Dessalines ordered his men who were hiding to come out and open fire, hitting the French with a tremendous volley of artillery and musket fire, inflicting heavy losses on the attackers. General Boudet himself was wounded and as the French dead and wounded started to pile up in the ditch, the French retreated. The next French commander who tried to assault the ditch was General Charles Dugua, joined shortly afterwards by the column commanded by Leclerc. All of the French assaults ended in total failure, and after the failure of their last attack, the Haitians charged the French, cutting down any Frenchmen. General Dugua was killed, Leclerc was wounded and the French lost about 800 dead. The final French column to arrive was the one commanded by Rochambeau, who brought along heavy artillery that knocked out the Haitian artillery, though his attempt to storm the ditch also ended in failure with about 300 of his men killed. Over the following days, the French kept on bombarding and assaulting the fort, only to be repulsed every time while the Haitians defiantly sang songs of the French Revolution, celebrating the right of all men to be equal and free. The Haitian psychological warfare was successful with many French soldiers asking why they were fighting to enslave the Haitians, who were only asserting the rights promised by the Revolution to make all men free. Despite Bonaparte's attempt to keep his intention to restore slavery a secret, it was widely believed by both sides that was why the French had returned to Haiti, as a sugar plantation could only be profitable with slave labour. Finally after twenty days of siege with food and ammunition running out, Dessalines ordered his men to abandon the fort on the night of 24 March 1802 and the Haitians slipped out of the fort to fight another day. Even Rochambeau, who hated all blacks was forced to admit in a report: \\"Their retreat‚Äîthis miraculous retreat from our trap‚Äîwas an incredible feat of arms\\". The French had won, but they had lost 2,000 dead against an opponent whom they held in contempt on racial grounds, believing all blacks to be stupid and cowardly, and furthermore, that it was shortages of food and ammunition that forced the Haitians to retreat, not because of any feats of arms by the French army. After the Battle of Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot, the Haitians abandoned conventional warfare and reverted to guerrilla tactics, making the French hold over much of the countryside from Le Cap down to the Artibonite valley very tenuous. With March, the rainy season came to Saint-Domingue, and as stagnant water collected, the mosquitoes began to breed, leading to yet another outbreak of yellow fever. By the end of March, 5,000 French soldiers had died of yellow fever and another 5,000 were hospitalized with yellow fever, leading to a worried Leclerc to write in his diary: \\"The rainy season has arrived. My troops are exhausted with fatigue and sickness\\". =Capture of Toussaint= On 25 April 1802, the situation suddenly changed when Christophe defected, along with much of the Haitian Army, to the French. Louverture was promised his freedom if he agreed to integrate his remaining troops into the French army. Louverture agreed to this on 6 May 1802. Just why Toussaint was motivated to just give up has been the subject of much debate with most probable explanation being that he was just tired after 11 years of war. Under the terms of surrender, Leclerc gave his solemn word that slavery would not be restored in Saint-Domingue, that blacks could be officers in the French Army, and that the Haitian Army would be allowed to integrate into the French Army. Leclerc also gave Toussaint a plantation at Ennery. Toussaint was later deceived, seized by the French and shipped to France. He died months later in prison at Fort-de-Joux in the Jura Mountains. Shortly afterwards, the ferocious Dessalines rode into Le Cap to submit to France and was rewarded by being made the governor of Saint-Marc, a place that Dessalines ruled with his customary cruelty. However, the surrender of Christophe, Toussaint, and Dessalines did not mean the end of Haitian resistance. Throughout the countryside, guerrilla warfare continued and the French staged mass executions via firing squads, hanging, and drowning Haitians in bags. Rochambeau invented a new means of mass execution, which he called \\"fumigational-sulphurous baths\\": killing hundreds of Haitians in the holds of ships by burning sulphur to make sulphur dioxide to gas them. War of Independence Battle at \\"Snake Gully\\" in 1802 =Rebellion against reimposition of slavery= For a few months, the island was quiet under Napoleonic rule. But when it became apparent that the French intended to re- establish slavery (because they had nearly done so on Guadeloupe), black cultivators revolted in the summer of 1802. Yellow fever had decimated the French; by the middle of July 1802, the French lost about 10,000 dead to yellow fever. By September, Leclerc wrote in his diary that he had only 8,000 fit men left as yellow fever had killed the others. Many of the \\"French\\" soldiers were actually Polish, as 5,000 Poles were serving in two demi- brigades in the French Army. Many Poles believed that if they fought for France, Bonaparte would reward them by restoring Polish independence, which had been ended with the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. Of the 5,000 Poles, about 4,000 died of yellow fever. A French planter wrote of the Polish soldiers: \\"Ten days after the landing of these two beautiful regiments, more than half their number were carried off by yellow fever; they fell down as they walked, the blood rushing out through their nostrils, mouths, eyes...what a horrible and heart-rending sight!\\". Sometimes, the Poles died in battle. At a battle at Port Sault, the Polish Third Battalion fought about 200 Haitians who ambushed them with musket fire and by pushing boulders down on them. One historian noted that \\"the Poles, rather than spreading out, each man for himself, slowly advanced in a tightly packed mass which afford an ideal target for the well-protected insurgent rifleman\\". Most of the Poles were cut down by the Haitians, which led Rochambeau to remark that one could always count on the Poles to die without flinching in battle. Some of the Poles came to believe that they were fighting on the wrong side, as they had joined the French Army to fight for freedom, not impose slavery. Some defected to join the Haitians. =Dessalines and P√©tion join Haitian forces= Dessalines and P√©tion remained allied with France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and fought against the French. As Leclerc lay dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap to be killed by drowning in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army. His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, killing everyone who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15,000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had been trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. (Other sources suggest the dogs may have been dogo cubanos sourced in their hundreds from Cuba rather than Jamaica.) At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned. No one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward, as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing that most of his army in Saint-Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French held only Port-au-Prince, Le Cap, and Les Cayes, sent about 20,000 reinforcements to Rochambeau. France's Leclerc Expedition to Haiti in 1804 Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites and sticking their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could see what he was planning on doing to them. Rochambeau's atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given. The Haitians were just as brutal as the French: they burned French prisoners alive, cut them up with axes, or tied them to a board and sawed them into two. The rebels finally managed to decisively defeat the French troops at the Battle of Verti√®res on 18 November 1803, leading the first ever group of enslaved peoples to successfully create an independent state through a slave revolt. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon accepted defeat in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. Dessalines won a string of victories against Leclerc and Rochambeau, becoming arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic France.Christer Petley, White Fury: A Jamaican Slaveholder and the Age of Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 182. Napoleon then turned his attention towards France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. With that, he withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France. =War between France and Britain= With Napoleon's inability to send the requested massive reinforcements after the outbreak of war on 18 May 1803 with the British ‚Äì the Royal Navy immediately despatched a squadron under Sir John Duckworth from Jamaica to cruise in the region, seeking to eliminate communication between the French outposts and to capture or destroy the French warships based in the colony. The Blockade of Saint- Domingue not only cut the French forces out from reinforcements and supplies from France, but also meant that the British began to supply arms to the Haitians. Trapped, engaged in a vicious race war, and with much of his army dying of yellow fever, Rochambeau fell to pieces. He lost interest in commanding his army and as James wrote, he \\"amused himself with sexual pleasures, military balls, banquets and the amassing of a personal fortune\\". The Royal Navy squadrons soon blockaded the French-held ports of Cap Fran√ßais and M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas on the Northern coast of the French colony. In the summer of 1803, when war broke out between the United Kingdom and the French Consulate, Saint-Domingue had been almost completely overrun by Haitian forces under the command of Jean-Jacques Dessalines. In the north of the country, the French forces were isolated in the two large ports of Cap Fran√ßais and M√¥le- Saint-Nicolas and a few smaller settlements, all supplied by a French naval force based primarily at Cap Fran√ßais. On 28 June, the squadron encountered a French convoy from Les Cayes off M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas, capturing one ship although the other escaped. Two days later an independently sailing French frigate was chased down and captured in the same waters. On 24 July another British squadron intercepted the main French squadron from Cap Fran√ßais, which was attempting to break past the blockade and reach France. The British, led by Commodore John Loring gave chase, but one French ship of the line and a frigate escaped. Another ship of the line was trapped against the coast and captured after coming under fire from Haitian shore batteries. The remainder of the squadron was forced to fight two more actions on their return to Europe, but did eventually reach the Spanish port of Corunna. Battle of Verti√®res in 1803 On 8 October 1803, the French abandoned Port-au-Prince as Rochambeau decided to concentrate what was left of his army at Le Cap. Dessalines marched into Port-au-Prince, where he was welcomed as a hero by the 100 whites who had chosen to stay behind. Dessalines thanked them all for their kindness and belief in racial equality, but then he said that the French had treated him as less than human when he was a slave, and so to avenge his mistreatment, he promptly had the 100 whites all hanged. On 3 November, the frigate HMS Blanche captured a supply schooner near Cap Fran√ßais, the last hope in supplying the French forces. On 16 November 1803, Dessalines began attacking the French blockhouses outside of Le Cap. The last battle on land of the Haitian Revolution, the Battle of Verti√®res, occurred on 18 November 1803, near Cap-Ha√Øtien fought between Dessalines' army and the remaining French colonial army under the Vicomte de Rochambeau; the slave rebels and freed revolutionary soldiers won the battle. By this point, Perry observed that both sides were \\"a little mad\\" as the pressures of the war and yellow fever had taken their toil, and both the French and the Haitians fought with a reckless courage, seeing death in battle as preferable to a slow death by yellow fever or being tortured to death by the enemy. =Haitian victory= Rochambeau, seeing defeat inevitable, procrastinated until the last possible moment, but eventually was forced to surrender to the British commander ‚Äì by the end of the month the garrison was starving, having reached the conclusion at a council of war that surrender was the only way to escape from this \\"place of death\\". Commodore Loring, however, refused the French permission to sail and agreed terms with Dessalines that permitted them to safely evacuate provided they had left the port by 1 December. On the night of 30 November 1803, 8,000 French soldiers and hundreds of white civilians boarded the British ships to take them away. One of Rochambeau's ships was almost wrecked while leaving the harbour, but was saved by a British lieutenant acting alone, who not only rescued the 900 people on board, but also refloated the ship. At M√¥le-Saint- Nicolas, General Louis de Noailles refused to surrender and instead sailed to Havana, Cuba in a fleet of small vessels on 3 December, but was intercepted and mortally wounded by a Royal Navy frigate. Soon after, the few remaining French-held towns in Saint-Domingue surrendered to the Royal Navy to prevent massacres by the Haitian army. Meanwhile, Dessalines led the rebellion until its completion, when the French forces were finally defeated by the end of 1803. On 1 January 1804, from the city of Gona√Øves, Dessalines officially declared the former colony's independence, renaming it \\"Haiti\\" after the indigenous Arawak name. Although he lasted from 1804 to 1806, several changes began taking place in Haiti. The independence of Haiti was a major blow to France and its colonial empire, but the French state would take several decades to recognize the loss of the colony. As the French retreated, Haiti, which had once been called the \\"Pearl of the Antilles\\", the richest French colony in the world, was impoverished, as its economy was in ruins after the revolution. Haiti struggled to recover economically from the war. The Haitians had paid a high price for their freedom, losing about 200,000 dead between 1791‚Äì1803, and unlike the majority of the European dead, who were killed by yellow fever, the majority of the Haitian dead were the victims of violence. Free republic On 1 January 1804, Dessalines, the new leader under the dictatorial 1805 constitution, declared Haiti a free republic in the name of the Haitian people,Haitian Declaration of Independence: Liberty or Death: Indigent Army, by the General in Chief Dessalines, in the name of the Haitian people. Held in the British National Archives: which was followed by the massacre of the remaining whites.Philippe Girard, \\"Jean-Jacques Dessalines and the Atlantic System: A Reappraisal,\\" William and Mary Quarterly (July 2012). His secretary Boisrond-Tonnerre stated, \\"For our declaration of independence, we should have the skin of a white man for parchment, his skull for an inkwell, his blood for ink, and a bayonet for a pen!\\"Independent Haiti, Library of Congress Country Studies. Haiti was the first independent nation in Latin America, the first post-colonial independent black-led nation in the world, and the only nation whose independence was gained as part of a successful slave rebellion. Dessalines valiantly proclaiming Haitian independence. The country was damaged from years of war, its agriculture devastated, its formal commerce nonexistent. The country, therefore, had to be rebuilt. To realise this goal, Dessalines adopted the economic organisation of serfdom. He proclaimed that every citizen would belong to one of two categories, laborer or soldier. Furthermore, he proclaimed the mastery of the state over the individual and consequently ordered that all laborers would be bound to a plantation. Those that possessed skills outside of plantation work, like craftsmanship and artisans, were exempt from this ordinance. To avoid the appearance of slavery, however, Dessalines abolished the ultimate symbol of slavery, the whip. Likewise, the working day was shortened by a third. His chief motivator nonetheless was production, and to this aim he granted much freedom to the plantations' overseers. Barred from using the whip, many instead turned to lianes, which were thick vines abundant throughout the island, to persuade the laborers to keep working. Many of the workers likened the new labor system to slavery, much like Toussaint L'Ouverture's system, which caused resentment between Dessalines and his people. Workers were given a fourth of all wealth produced from their labor. Nevertheless, he succeeded in rebuilding much of the country and in raising production levels, thus slowly rebuilding the economy. Dessalines paid large sums of money to liberate slaves on slave ships in near the Haitian coast. He paid for the expenses of the returns of the thousands of Haitian refugees that left during the revolution. Fearing a return of French forces, Dessalines first expanded and maintained a significant military force. During his reign, nearly 10% of able- bodied men were in active service resulting in a military force of up to 37,000 men. Furthermore, Dessalines ordered the construction of massive fortifications throughout the island, like the Citadelle Laferri√®re, the largest fortress in the Western Hemisphere. Cities and commercial centers were moved to the interior of the country, while less important ones were kept to the coast, so they could be burnt down completely to discourage the French; many commentators believe that this over militarization contributed to many of Haiti's future problems. In fact, because young fit men were the most likely to be drafted into the army, the plantations were thus deprived of the workforce needed to function properly. There was growing frustration between the workers, the elites, and Dessalines. A conspiracy lead by the mulatto elites ultimately lead to Dessalines assassination and two separate sovereign states of Haiti. =1804 massacre of the French= An 1806 engraving of Jean- Jacques Dessalines. It depicts the general, sword raised in one arm, while the other holds a severed head of a white woman. The 1804 massacre was carried out against the remaining white population of French colonists and loyalists, both enemies and traitors of the revolution, by the black population of Haiti on the order of Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who declared the French as barbarians, demanding their expulsion and vengeance for their crimes. The massacre‚Äîwhich took place in the entire territory of Haiti‚Äîwas carried out from early February 1804 until 22 April 1804. During February and March, Dessalines traveled among the cities of Haiti to assure himself that his orders were carried out. Despite his orders, the massacres were often not carried out until he personally visited the cities. The course of the massacre showed an almost identical pattern in every city he visited. Before his arrival, there were only a few killings, despite his orders. When Dessalines arrived, he first spoke about the atrocities committed by former French authorities, such as Rochambeau and Leclerc, after which he demanded that his orders about mass killings of the area's French population be carried out. Reportedly, he also ordered the unwilling to take part in the killings, especially men of mixed race, so that blame would not rest solely on the black population. Mass killings then took place on the streets and on places outside the cities. In parallel to the killings, plundering and rape also occurred. Women and children were generally killed last. White women were \\"often raped or pushed into forced marriages under threat of death\\". By the end of April 1804, some 3,000 to 5,000 persons had been killed practically eradicating the country's white population. Dessalines had specifically stated that France is \\"the real enemy of the new nation.\\" This allowed certain categories of whites to be excluded from massacre who had to pledge their rejection to France: the Polish soldiers who deserted from the French army; the group of German colonists of Nord-Ouest who were inhabitants before the revolution; French widows who were allowed to keep their property; select male Frenchmen; and a group of medical doctors and professionals. Reportedly, also people with connections to Haitian notables were spared, as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white men. In the 1805 constitution that declared all its citizens as black, it specifically mentions the naturalizations of German and Polish peoples enacted by the government, as being exempt from Article XII that prohibited whites (\\"non-Haitians;\\" foreigners) from owning land. Post Revolution Era An independent government was created in Haiti, but the country's society remained deeply affected by patterns established under French colonial rule. As in other French colonial societies, a class of free people of color had developed after centuries of French rule here. Many planters or young unmarried men had relations with African or Afro-Caribbean women, sometimes providing for their freedom and that of their children, as well as providing for education of the mixed-race children, especially the boys. Some were sent to France for education and training, which sometimes provided entree into the French military. The mulattoes who returned to Saint-Domingue became the elite of the people of color. As an educated class used to the French political system, they became the elite of Haitian society after the war's end. Many of them had used their social capital to acquire wealth, and some already owned land. Some had identified more with the French colonists than the slaves. Many of the free people of color, by contrast, were raised in French culture, had certain rights within colonial society, and generally spoke French and practiced Catholicism (with syncretic absorption of African religions.) Following Dessaline's assassination, another of Toussaint's black generals, Henri Christophe, succeeded his in control of the north, while Alexandre P√©tion presided over mulatto rule in the south. There were large differences in governance between Petion's republic, and what would eventually become Christophe's kingdom. While the southern republic did not have as much focus on economic development, and put more attention on liberal land distribution and education, the northern kingdom went on to become relatively wealthy, though wealth distribution was disputed. As a result of temporary trade agreements between Christophe, the United States, and British colonies, Christophe was able to rebuild the northern region. There were large investments in education and public works, military infrastructure, and many chateaux, the most notable being the Sans Souci palace in Milot. However, much like his predecessors, this was achieved through forced labor which ultimately lead to his downfall. Contrarily, Petion was beloved by his people, but despised by his northern counterpart. A major effort by Christophe to take Port-au-Prince in mid‚Äì1812 failed. The mulattoes were harassed by a pocket of black rebellion in their rear from February 1807 to May 1819. A black leader named Goman kept alive the angry spirit of Dessalines in the southern mountains of the Grand-Anse, resisting several mulatto punitive expeditions. Finally, in 1819, the new mulatto leader, Jean-Pierre Boyer, sent six regiments into the Grand-Anse to ferret out Goman. The black rebel was trapped and shot off a 1,000-foot-high cliff. In 1820, the island nation was finally reunified when Christophe, ill and surrounded by new rebellions, killed himself. Boyer with 20,000 troops marched into Cap-Ha√Øtien, the northern capital, shortly afterward to establish his power over all of Haiti. Not too long after, Boyer was able to secure cooperation with the general of the neighboring Spanish Haiti, and in February 1822 began a 22 year long unification with the eastern state. The nascent state's future was hobbled in 1825 when France forced it (with French warships anchored off the coast during the negotiations) to pay 150 million gold francs in reparations to French ex- slaveholders‚Äîas a condition of French political recognition and to end the newly formed state's political and economic isolation. By an order of 17 April 1825, the King of France renounced his rights of sovereignty over Santo Domingo, and recognized the independence of Haiti.M. Degros, Cr√©ation des postes diplomatiques et consulaires, Revue d'histoire diplomatique, 1986; in FrenchJ-F. Bri√®re, Ha√Øti et la France, 1804‚Äì1848: le r√™ve bris√©, Paris, Karthala 2008; in French President Jean-Pierre Boyer believed that the constant threat of a French invasion was stymieing the Haitian economy and thus felt the need to settle the matter once and for all. Though the amount of the reparations was reduced to 60 million francs in 1838, Haiti was unable to finish paying off its debt until 1947. The indemnity bankrupted the Haitian treasury and left the country's government deeply impoverished, causing long- term instability. Haiti was therefore forced to take out a loan from French banks, who provided the funds for the large first installment, severely affecting Haiti's ability to prosper. While Haiti suffered major economic setbacks during the early years of the post revolutionary era, the ideals of freedom and anti-colonialism never ceased to be part of the Haitian consciousness. Citizenship was offered to any slave or oppressed person that made it to Haiti's shores as mandated by Dessaline's constitution. All four of Haiti's earlier rulers, Dessalines, Christophe, Petion, and Boyer all had programs that involved swaying African Americans to resettle there and assure their freedom. Slave boats that were captured and brought to Haiti's shores resulted in the liberation and integration of all captives on board into Haitian society. On one occasion, President Alexandre Petion protected Jamaican slaves from re-enslavement after they escaped their plantation and landed in the southern city of J√©r√©mie.. On multiple occasions, Haiti's leaders offered asylum to liberal revolutionaries globally. One of the more notable examples of this included Haiti's involvement with Gran Colombia, where Dessalines and Petion both offered aid, ammunitions, and asylum to Fransisco de Miranda and Simon Bolivar, who even went as far as to credit Haiti for the liberation of his country . Dessalines offered citizenship and assistance to slaves in Martinique and Guadeloupe so that they could start their own uprisings. Mexican nationalists, Javier Mina and Jose Joaquin de Hererra took asylum in Les Cayes and were welcomed by Petion during Mexico's War of Independence. The Greeks later received support from President Boyer during their fight against the Ottomans. The end of the Haitian Revolution in 1804 marked the end of colonialism on the island. However, the social conflict cultivated under slavery continued to affect the population for years to come. Mulatto domination of politics and economics, and urban life after the revolution, created a different kind of two-caste society, as most Haitians were rural subsistence farmers. The affranchi √©lite, who continued to rule Haiti while the formidable Haitian army kept them in power. France continued the slavery system in French Guiana, Martinique, and Guadeloupe. Impact on slavery in the Americas Historians continue to debate the importance of the Haitian Revolution. David Geggus asks: \\"How much of a difference did it make?\\" A limited amount, he concludes, for slavery flourished in the western hemisphere for many more decades. In the opposing camp, African-American historian W. E. B. Du Bois said that the Haitian Revolution was an economic pressure without which the British parliament would not have accepted abolitionism as readily. Other historians say the Haitian Revolution influenced slave rebellions in the US as well as in British colonies. The biggest slave revolt in US history was the 1811 German Coast Uprising in Louisiana. This slave rebellion was put down and the punishment the slaves received was so severe that no contemporary news reports about it exist. The neighboring revolution brought the slavery question to the forefront of US politics, and though inspiring to the enslaved themselves See also . the resulting intensification of racial divides and sectional politics ended the idealism of the Revolutionary period.Newman, Simon P. \\"American Political Culture and the French and Haitian Revolutions: Nathaniel Cutting and the Jeffersonian Republicans.\\" The Impact of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World. Ed. David P. Geggus. (University of South Carolina Press 2001). The American President Thomas Jefferson‚Äîwho was a slaveholder himself‚Äîrefused to establish diplomatic relations with Haiti (the United States did not recognize Haiti until 1862) and imposed an economic embargo on trade with Haiti that also lasted until 1862 in an attempt to ensure the economic failure of the new republic as Jefferson wanted Haiti to fail, regarding a successful slave revolt in the West Indies as a dangerous example for American slaves. Saint-Domingue slave revolt in 1791 Beginning during the slave insurrections of 1791, white refugees from Saint-Domingue fled to the United States, particularly to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, and Charleston. The immigration intensified after the journ√©e (crisis) of 20 June 1793, and soon American families began to raise money and open up their homes to help exiles in what became the United States' first refugee crisis. While some white refugees blamed the French Revolutionary government for sparking the violence in Haiti, many supported the Republican regime and openly expressed their support of the Jacobins.Popkin, Jeremy D. 'You Are All Free: The Haitian Revolution and the Abolition of Slavery. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. There is also some historical evidence suggesting that displaying solidarity with the French Revolution was the easiest way for the refugees to earn the support and sympathy of the Americans, who had just recently lived through their own revolution.Popkin, p. 298. American slaveholders, in particular, commiserated with the French planters who had been forcibly removed from their plantations in Saint-Domingue. While the exiles found themselves in a peaceful situation in the United States‚Äîsafe from the violence raging in both France and Haiti‚Äîtheir presence complicated the already precarious diplomatic relations among the UK, France, and the US. Many of the whites and free people of color who left Saint-Domingue for the United States settled in southern Louisiana, adding many new members to its French- speaking, mixed-race, and black populations. The exiles causing the greatest amount of alarm were the African slaves who came with their refugee owners. Some southern planters grew concerned that the presence of these slaves who had witnessed the revolution in Haiti would ignite similar revolts in the United States.Davis, David Brion. \\"Impact of the French and Haitian Revolutions.\\" The Impact of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World. Ed. David P. Geggus. (Columbia, South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press 2001). Other planters, however, were confident they had the situation under control.Ashli White, Encountering Revolution: Haiti and the Making of the Early Republic (2010) p. 139 In 1807 Haiti was divided into two parts, the Republic of Haiti in the south, and the Kingdom of Haiti in the north. Land could not be privately owned; it reverted to the State through Biens Nationaux (national bonds), and no French whites could own land. The remaining French settlers were forced to leave the island. Those who refused were slaughtered. The Haitian State owned up to 90% of the land and the other 10% was leased in 5-year intervals. Since the resistance and the murderous disease environment made it impossible for Napoleon to regain control over Haiti, he gave up hope of rebuilding a French New World empire. He decided to sell Louisiana to the US. The Haitian Revolution brought about two unintended consequences: the creation of a continental America and the virtual end of Napoleonic rule in the Americas. There never again was such a large-scale slave rebellion. Napoleon reversed the French abolition of slavery in law, constitution, and practice, which had occurred between 1793 and 1801, and reinstated slavery in the French colonies in 1801‚Äì1803‚Äîwhich lasted until 1848. Relationship between the French and Haitian Revolutions =Reason for revolution= The Haitian Revolution was a revolution ignited from below, by the underrepresented majority of the population.Fick, Carolyn E. \\"Preface.\\" In The Making of Haiti: The Saint Domingue Revolution from Below. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1990. A huge majority of the supporters of the Haitian revolution were slaves and freed Africans who were severely discriminated against by colonial society and the law.Akamefula, Tiye, Camille Newsom, Burgey Marcos, and Jong Ho. \\"Causes of the Haitian Revolution.\\" Haitian Revolution. 1 September 2012.

Accessed 25 March 2015. http://scholar.library.miami.edu/slaves/san_domingo_revolution/ individual_essay/david.html. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion in history. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On 4 April 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in saint-Domingue. The revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent state solely of freed peoples.Akamefula, Tiye, Camille Newsom, Burgey Marcos, and Jong Ho. \\"Causes of the Haitian Revolution.\\" Haitian Revolution. 1 September 2012. Accessed 25 March 2015. . The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential revolution in history.Baur, John. \\"International Repercussions of the Haitian Revolution.\\" The Americas 26, no. 4 (1970). Historiographical debates While acknowledging the cross-influences, most contemporary historians distinguish the Haitian Revolution from the French Revolution. Some also separate it from the earlier armed conflicts by free men of color who were seeking expansion of political rights for themselves, but not the abolition of slavery. These scholars show that if the agency of the enslaved blacks becomes the focus of studies, the Revolution's opening and closing dates are certain. From this premise, the narrative began with the enslaved blacks' bid for freedom through armed struggle and concluded with their victory over slavery powers and the creation of an independent state. In April 1791, a massive black insurgency in the north of the island rose violently against the plantation system, setting a precedent of resistance to racial slavery. In cooperation with their former mulatto rivals, blacks ended the Revolution in November 1803 when they decidedly defeated the French army at the Battle of Verti√®res. The French had already lost a high proportion of their troops to yellow fever and other diseases. After acknowledging defeat in Saint-Domingue, Napoleon withdrew from North America, agreeing to the Louisiana Purchase by the United States. Although the series of events during these years is known under the name of \\"Haitian Revolution\\", alternative views suggest that the entire affair was an assorted number of coincidental conflicts that ended with a fragile truce between free men of color and blacks. Historians debate whether the victorious Haitians were \\"intrinsically [a] revolutionary force\\". One thing is certain: Haiti became an independent country on 1 January 1804, when the council of generals chose Jean-Jacques Dessalines to assume the office of governor-general. One of the state's first significant documents was Dessaliness' \\"Liberty or Death\\" speech, which circulated broadly in the foreign press. In it, the new head of state made the case for the new nation's objective: the permanent abolition of slavery in Haiti. The role of women in the Haitian Revolution was for a long time given little attention by historians, but has in recent years garnered significant attention. Contemporary press response The revolution of African slaves brought many fears to colonies surrounding Haiti and the Caribbean. Prominent wealthy American slave owners, reading about the revolution, also read speculation about what might come in their own states. Anti-abolitionist critics of the revolution dubbed it \\"the horrors of Santo Domingo\\". However, newspapers like the Colombian Centinel took extra steps to support the revolution, comparing it to the American Revolution.Matthewson, Tim, 1996 Jefferson and the Nonrecognition of Haiti, p. 30 The French media also played an important role in the Haitian Revolution, with contributions that made many French upstarts quite interested in the young, passionate Toussaint's writings of freedom. There were many written discussions about the events in Haiti during the revolution in both France and England, however, they were generally written by anonymous authors. These texts also generally fell into two camps ‚Äî one being proslavery authors who warned of a repetition of the violence of St. Domingue wherever abolition occurred; and the other being abolitionist authors who countered that white owners had sowed the seeds of revolution. However, all was not simple in the press. A top critic who significantly drove Toussaint into fear of backlash from France was Sonthonax, who was responsible for many outlooks of Haiti in the French newspapers.Jenson, The Sonthonax Drama: Toussaint as Political Dramaturge, p. 70 Yet Sonthonax was one of the few contenders who truly pushed for the independence of the African slaves and became a major factor in Toussaint's decision of declaring independence from France.

The most common way of collecting information on these events is through civil registration, an administrative system used by governments to record vital events which occur in their populations. Efforts to improve the quality of vital statistics will therefore be closely related to the development of civil registration systems in countries. A vital statistics system is defined by the United Nations \\"as the total process of (a) collecting information by civil registration or enumeration on the frequency or occurrence of specified and defined vital events, as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and the person or persons concerned, and (b) compiling, processing, analyzing, evaluating, presenting, and disseminating these data in statistical form\\" (UN, 2001). Civil registration, as defined by the United Nations, is the\\" continuous, permanent, compulsory, and universal recording of the occurrence and characteristics of vital events (live births, deaths, fetal deaths, marriages, and divorces) and other civil status events pertaining to the population as provided by decree, law or regulation, in accordance with the legal requirements in each country.\\" The origin of vital statistics begins as early as 1854 with James Stark in Register House in Edinburgh in reaction to the Scottish Registration ActScottish Registration Act 1854 and death by social class was recorded in England beginning in 1921.Caselli G. Health Transition and Cause-specific Mortality. In: Schofield R, Reher D, Bideau A, editors. The Decline of Mortality in Europe. Oxford: Clarendon Press; 1991. While the number of births and deaths can be obtained by enumeration at certain points in time (e.g. censuses and surveys), civil registration collects this information on a continuous basis and is the only source that provides individuals with a legal document. For instance, the importance of birth registration as the first legal recognition of the child is emphasized in Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that \\"the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents\\". United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a number of non-governmental organizations (Plan International, Save the Children Fund, World Vision, etc.) have particularly promoted the human rights aspects of registration, while the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) have focused more on the statistical aspects of civil registration. Countries which are signatories to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are therefore expected to set up systems to register the births of all children. Non-registration of a child can have negative consequences on the wider enjoyment of a child‚Äôs fundamental rights to benefits such as identity, inheritance, education, health and other social services. Birth registration is also part of a broader strategy to ensure that children are less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, especially if separated from their parents. In the absence of a functioning birth registration system, it is difficult to see how a country can enforce age-related legal concerns such as schooling, child labour, juvenile justice, early marriage, sexual exploitation and military recruitment. Recent natural disasters and calamities have also demonstrated the utility of a birth certificate for reuniting lost children with their families. Many civil registration systems also collect information on causes of death. Statistics based on these death records are of particular importance in public health for identifying the magnitude and distribution of major disease problems, and are essential for the design, implementation, monitoring, and assessment of health programmes and policies. Toronto scientist, professor Prabhat Jha argues that inexpensive recording of vital statistics in developing countries is the most effective means to improve global health and has outlined 5 options for expanding Cause of Death reporting. \\"Despite the importance of tracking causes of death and the tradition since 1893 of standardisation of definitions and coding for causes of death in the International Classification of Diseases and Injuries (ICD), global assessments of causes of death are a major analytical challenge. Vital registration systems that include medical certification of the cause of death captured about 18.8 million deaths of an estimated annual total of 51.7 million deaths in 2005, which is the latest year for which the largest number of countries reported deaths from a vital registration system. Even for these deaths, the comparability of findings on the leading causes of death is affected by variation in certification skills among physicians, the diagnostic and pathological data available at the time of completing a death certificate, variations in medical culture in choosing the underlying cause, and legal and institutional frameworks for governing mortality reporting. For the remaining deaths that are not medically certified, many different data sources and diagnostic approaches must be used from surveillance systems, demographic research sites, surveys, censuses, disease registries, and police records to construct a consolidated picture of causes of death in various populations. Because of the variety of data sources and their associated biases, causes of death assessments are inherently uncertain and subject to vigorous debate.\\" The agency responsible for overseeing this system in the United States is the National Center for Health Statistics, a division of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

It is administered by the Japan Registry Services. At the establishment of the .jp domain the domain was administered by the JPNIC, as part of their role as an overseeing technical body for the Internet in Japan. However, due to the growing importance and size of the .jp registry, it was decided at the 11th General Meeting of JPNIC in December 2000 to create a new corporation that would manage the .jp domain. Thus, the Japan Registry Service was created, and on June 30, 2003, officially assumed the duties of the .jp registry. .jp registrations are only allowed if the registrant has a physical address in Japan. Registrations are processed via accredited registrars and domain names with Japanese characters (kanji, hiragana or katakana) may be registered at the second level.

There are two second-level domains reserved for the two areas: and , but other web addresses are also used. History Svalbard and Jan Mayen are two integrated territories of Norway with special status (unincorporated area). The Svalbard Treaty grants Norway full sovereignty of Svalbard, but the archipelago holds special status as among other things a free economic zone and is not part of the European Economic Area and the Schengen Area. Jan Mayen is a nearly unpopulated volcanic island in the Atlantic Ocean and is a fully integrated part of Norway. During the establishment of the ISO 3166 codes, it was proposed that Svalbard have its own code, but the Norwegian authorities chose to also include Jan Mayen in the area.

It was displayed at shopping malls, state fairs, and carnivals in the United States and Canada in the 1960s and early 1970s and promoted as the \\"missing link\\" between man and Neanderthals. It was sold on eBay in 2013 and put on display in Austin, Texas. Description Two views of the Iceman: Frozen, and as described by Sanderson & Heuvelmans It has been described as male, human-like, 6 ft (~1.8 m) tall, hairy, with large hands and feet, very dark brown hair about 3 - 4 inches (~9 cm) long, and a flattened nose. One of its arms appeared to be broken and one of its eyes appeared to have been knocked out of its socket, allegedly by a bullet that was said to have entered the creature's head from behind. Scientists determined that it was likely to be a hoax due to Neanderthals going extinct thousands of years ago. History Promoter and exhibitor Frank Hansen stated the Minnesota Iceman was discovered in the region of Siberia and that he was acting as its caretaker for an absentee owner he described as an \\"eccentric California millionaire\\". Touring carnivals and fairs with the exhibit, Hansen was once reportedly detained by Canada Customs officials, who were concerned he was transporting a cadaver. The FBI was informed that the subject might potentially be a human murder victim, but the agency did not investigate, possibly due to many believing it was a hoax. Sanderson, then science editor for Argosy magazine, authored an article about the Iceman in the April 1969 issue that featured the headline, \\"Is this the missing link between man and the apes?\\" Sanderson also spoke about the Iceman in television appearances, and contacted primatologist John Napier, asking him to investigate it under the official auspices of Smithsonian Institution. Hansen subsequently withdrew the Minnesota Iceman from public inspection, saying the withdrawal was on orders from its California-based owner. Hansen later provided a new \\"Iceman\\" for exhibit, described by observers as a latex model that was clearly different from the original. Napier, in conjunction with the Smithsonian, made preliminary investigations of Hansen's affairs and said he found that Hansen had commissioned the creation of the Iceman from a West Coast company in 1967, leading Napier to quickly conclude there was only ever one Iceman latex model that he theorized was repositioned and refrozen between appearances. Napier stated that \\"The Smithsonian Institution‚Ä¶is satisfied that the creature is simply a carnival exhibit made of latex rubber and hair...the 'original' model and the present so-called 'substitute' are one and the same.\\"  2013 sale  In February 2013, the Minnesota Iceman was reportedly auctioned on eBay. The listing read: \\"This is the actual sideshow gaff billed as \\"The Minnesota Iceman\\" by Frank Hansen in the 1960s. This is a one of a kind hoax that was fabricated by a mid-20th century showman.\\" It was purchased by Austin, Texas, \\"Museum of the Weird\\" owner Steve Busti, who has placed it on public display.  Popular culture  The Minnesota Iceman was featured on season 4 episode 6 of the A&E; series Shipping Wars as well as season 12 episode 26 of the Travel Channel series Mysteries at the Museum. The story of the iceman was also featured in the 7th season premiere of the television show Unsolved Mysteries.

Early that year, Booth's surveyors trespassed on the Indian reserve to run lines from Rose Point Narrows to the site. Taking advantage of a provision of the Indian Act that allowed native-owned land to be expropriated for use as a railway, he pressured the Anishinaabe reserve to sell to the railway. A further was acquired by expropriation in 1899. When completed, Depot Harbour became one of the most prominent ports on the Great Lakes, rivalling Collingwood, Midland and Owen Sound. It was the shortest route for shipping grain to the Atlantic, with trains arriving and departing every twenty minutes, and was known as the best natural harbour on the Great Lakes. Booth built a town site with 110 houses, along with two large grain elevators, docks, a railway station, a hotel and shops. The town's population reached 1,600 permanent residents in 1926. There may have been as many as 3,000 inhabitants in the summers.

The engine is shown in Depot Harbour, the western end of the line. Decline Booth sold his railway to the Grand Trunk Railway in 1904. In 1923, the railway became part of the government-owned Canadian National Railways. The reconstruction of the Welland Canal in 1932, along with 1933 abandonment of a portion of the line in Algonquin Provincial Park (as a consequence of the Cache Lake trestle being damaged by ice), and a drop in grain prices during the Great Depression, contributed to a loss of importance for Depot Harbour, and the CNR closed the facilities in favour of its own at South Parry. The town fell into disrepair and as its population gradually declined, Depot Harbour was abandoned. During World War II, cordite manufactured in nearby Nobel was stored in the railway's dockside freight sheds across the inlet from the grain elevators. In the summer of 1945, the timber frame grain elevators were dismantled. On August 14, as preparations were being made for V-J Day celebrations in other places, the partly dismantled elevators accidentally caught fire. Flying embers carried by the wind, landed on the roofs of the freight sheds, setting off explosives which destroyed whatever remained of the harbour facilities. By late August 1959, all residential buildings had been removed, with only foundations remaining. After the debris had been cleared away from the site of the burnt-down grain elevators, the wharf was used as a distribution terminal for the Century Coal Company, a subsidiary of Canada Steamship Lines. As the market for coal declined in the late 1950s the docks were silenced once again. By 1959 use of the wharf was acquired by National Steel Corporation for loading pelletized iron ore from its Low Phos Mine at Sellwood. A rail mounted gantry crane was installed along the length of the wharf. and were regular visitors to Depot Harbour. When the mine closed in 1979, Depot Harbour was silenced once more. The Anishinaabe reclaimed the expropriated lands in 1987. Little remains of the town except scattered foundations. The bank vault can still be found as well as the loading docks. Only one building remains in use as a cottage. The port is still in use as a fish farm, owned by a local resident on the reserve.

During his military career he served in relevant Army offices and he joined the political career in 1976, when the Prime Minister appointed him as First Deputy Prime Minister for Defence Affairs. From 1977 to 1979 he also served as Minister of Defence (the first since the Civil War).Puell, 1997 In 1994, the socialist government of Felipe Gonz√°lez granted him the honorary rank of Captain General.  Education and military training  Offspring of an ancient Madrilenian bourgeois family, his parents died when he was a little child. However, his uncle, Saturnino Calleja, a well known publisher, paid for his education at the Royal College of San Anton in Madrid, which was an elite boarding school at the time. There, in response to his family's solidarity and revealing for the first time his future strength of spirit and responsibility, graduated with an excellent academic degree (currently in safe keeping at Cardinal Cisneros High School). His wish to become an Artillery officer was shattered by the military reforms of the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera in 1927, which forced him to study at the General Military Academy of Zaragoza, directed by General Francisco Franco, to obtain his qualifications.Puell, 1997, 32-48 Five months after the proclamation of the Spanish Second Republic he was promoted to second lieutenant and later finished his military education at the Academy of Artillery and Engineers of Segovia, where he graduated as first lieutenant in July 1933, having achieved top grades in his class.Puell, 1997, 49-75  Second Republic and Civil War  His first appointment was the Horse Artillery Regiment, based at the so-called Canton of Campamento, an isolated group of barracks seven kilometers west of Madrid.Orden circular de 26 de julio de 1933: Diario Oficial del Ministerio de la Guerra, 173 In 1935 he joined Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS,Serrano de Pablo, 1986, 32 an extreme right wing political party, and on the dawn of July 20, 1936 he took arms with his unit in rebellion against the Frente Popular Government, being very active and combatant during their rebellion.http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/view.php?pid=bibliuned:IUGM- DocGGM-19400408 After ten hours of fighting, the coup was controlled by the republican militia. Guti√©rrez Mellado escaped by walking to the nearby village of Villaviciosa de Od√≥n, frequented by his family during their summer holidays, and later returned to Madrid in early August. Republican authorities indicted him for being involved in the July rebellion and he was jailed at his old school of San Anton, being fortunate enough not to have been included in the lethal lists that cost the lives of many other officers.Puell, 1997, 100-105 In February 1937, a jury declared him not guilty on the basis of his assertion, which was corroborated by two witnesses, that he was ill at Villaviciosa de Od√≥n around the time of mid July and so was not able to take part in the coup d'√©tat. However, simultaneous police inquires unveiled his active intervention in it, what induced him to take shelter at an embassy. A few weeks later he joined Franco's clandestine intelligence services operating in Madrid, provided with an ID card belonging to a deceased republican soldier named Teodosio Paredes Laina.http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/view.php?pid=bibliuned:IUGM-DocGGM-19391116 In March 1938 he was promoted to captain. National Authorities had just organized the Information and Military Police Service (SIPM in its Spanish acronym) and he was appointed head of one of the three SIPM platoons assigned to the corps that besieged the capital. Guti√©rrez Mellado provided his superiors with precious pieces of information related to republican plans, deployment and armament. He also was put in charge of the evacuation of more than a hundred pilots and engineer officers to the National Zone, specialties which were much needed by the francoist forces.http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/view.php?pid=bibliuned:IUGM-DocGGM-19391116  Military career  In 1941, after graduating from the General Staff School,Rosa, 2009 he was appointed to the Ministry of the Army intelligence services. During World War II, having been promoted to major, he became responsible for the classification and final destination of the thousands of people that crossed the Pyrenees escaping from Nazi terror.San Mart√≠n, 1983, 223 In 1945, Guti√©rrez Mellado was assigned to the Information Section of the High General Staff and travelled to Belgium, France and Switzerland to acquire information about attitudes and activities of republican exiles.Puell, 1997, 135-136 Furthermore, from 1953 to 1955, due to the pacts subscribed by Franco with the US Government, he acted as liaison officer between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), responsible for building the bases and facilities for US Armed Forces on Spanish soil.Puell, 1997, 137 In 1956, close his promotion to lieutenant colonel and forced by the meager pay offered to the military at the time, he decided to quit the Army temporarily. He then went to work as a commercial manager for seven years within various companies.San Mart√≠n, 1983, 223 Around this time, approximately two thirds of the military officers based in Spain's largest cities were involved in the practice of moonlighting. However, only a few of them made the drastic decision to leave the Army, as Guti√©rrez Mellado did, considering it unethical to hold two different jobs at the same time and led to the detriment of his military commitment.Puell, 2005, 207 In 1963 he returned to active duty as an instructor of the University Militia, which was aimed to train reserve officers and sergeants.Puell, 2010 Two years later, in 1965, he was promoted to colonel and assigned to the Operations Section of the Army Central Staff. Due to his fluency in English and French he was sent as an observer to several NATO maneuvers, which alerted him to the poor operational capacities of the highly overstaffed, late Francoist Spanish Armed Forces.Puell, 1997, 151-152 In 1967 Guti√©rrez Mellado was assigned to be Commander in Chief of the 13th Field Artillery Regiment, based at Getafe, just outside Madrid; and on April 13, 1970 was promoted to brigadier general.Real decreto 1019/1970: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 88 For little more than a year he served as a professor at the High Center for National Defense Studies (CESEDEN), then directed by lieutenant general Manuel D√≠ez-Alegr√≠a. When D√≠ez- Alegr√≠a was appointed Commander in Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, he took Guti√©rrez Mellado with him.Puell, 1997, 156-158 General Guti√©rrez Mellado's December 14, 1971 lecture at CESEDEN was the object of very favorable commentaries in military circles because of his speech's direct and accurate nature ‚Äîsomething rather unusual at that time in Spain.http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/view.php?pid=bibliuned:IUGM-DocGGM-19711215 After being promoted to major general in 1973,Real decreto 392/1973: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado: 61 a second lecture at the same Center, dated March 15, 1974, drew much broader attention than the first, due to his open vindication of urgent and radical reforms on the Armed Forces structure and organization. These words attracted the attention of many future leaders of the transition towards democracy ‚ÄîPrince Juan Carlos de Bourbon among them.http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/view.php?pid=bibliuned:IUGM-DocGGM-19740315 On June 14, 1975 Franco appointed him as General Commander and Governmental Delegate in Ceuta,Reales decretos 1287/1975 y 11289/1975: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 142 posts that he shared with his previous commitment as head of the military delegation responsible for negotiating the January 1976 Spanish- American legislative treaty.Puell, 1997, 169-174 On April 13, 1976 King Juan Carlos first Government promoted him to lieutenant general in command of VII Military Region.Real decreto 722/1976: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 89 His first public address to the troops upon arriving in Valladolid immediately became press headlines and was subject to laudatory editorials and opinions in many political reviews. Not in vain it was the first time, during those hazardous days of transition, with public opinion wondering and deeply worried about the Armed Forces‚Äô future attitude and behavior, Spaniards heard of a high ranking Army officer openly aligned with the Rule of Law and demanding absolute respect from his subordinates towards civil power: ‚ÄúWe must never forget that the Army, no matter how sacred its mission may be, is not there to rule but to serve under the command of the national government, and that its exclusive purpose is to serve Spain and our King‚Äù.Guti√©rrez Mellado, 29 In July 1976, Guti√©rrez Mellado was appointed Commander in Chief of the Army General Staff following favorable remarks about his virtues made by King Juan Carlos to Adolfo Su√°rez, the recently nominated Prime Minister.Real decreto 1503/1976: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 157 Only three months later, on September 23, Guti√©rrez Mellado was appointed Vice President for Defense Affairs, a recently created office aimed at promoting the modernization of the Armed Forces.Real decreto 2217/1976: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado 229 There he replaced lieutenant general Fernando de Santiago, who had abruptly resigned to demonstrate his opposition to President Su√°rez's political reforms. Guti√©rrez Mellado remained at that office till February 1981.  First Vice-President of the Government for Defense Affairs and Minister of Defense  Facts lead one to think that he had been planning carefully, when presented the proper opportunity, to quickly reform and transform Franco's sclerotic Armed Forces in depth. That allowed him, with less than a hundred days in office, to outline a complete reform project to be submitted to the Military Affairs Governmental Commission's first meeting on January 4, 1977, chaired by President Su√°rez.Puell, 1997, 205-206 His detailed reform project comprised a series of actions to be urgently taken on the following areas: defense superstructure; Armed Forces financial program; integrated personnel policy, and the limitation of the competence of military jurisdiction. The plan was wholly implemented before Guti√©rrez Mellado left his office in 1981 and even successfully achieved other important issues, such as the creation of the Ministry of Defense on July 4, 1977. Also on that date, he was also called to take charge of the new department and he remained in office until September 23, 1979, when the Democratic Center Union (UCD) executive, Agust√≠n Rodr√≠guez Sahag√∫n, took over, thus becoming the first civilian to chair a military department since 1939. Guti√©rrez Mellado remained as Vice-President of the Government to coordinate Security and National Defense AffairsReal decreto 709/1979: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 83 until President Leopoldo Calvo- Sotelo's investiture in February 1981.Real decreto 257/1981: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 50 In addition to creation and organization of the Ministry of Defense and the consequent suppression of the Ministries of the Army, Navy and Air Force, special consideration should be given to the following measures:Puell, 2012 ‚Äî instauration of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JUJEM); ‚Äî operative command attribution over their respective branches to the Army, Navy and Air Force Chiefs of Staff; ‚Äî legislative approval of 1980 Law of Defense and Military Organization Basic Criteria; ‚Äî banning of military intervention in politics; ‚Äî reform of the General Ordinance dictated by Charles III in 1768; ‚Äî Armed Forces Social Institute (ISFAS) implementation; ‚Äî instauration of the annual Armed Forces Day to substitute the military parade commemorating Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War; ‚Äî officer promotion system regulation, and ‚Äî homologation of military salaries to those of public employees of a similar level (which most certainly abolished moonlighting). It is obvious that this reform packet has been partially changed by the successive Ministers of Defense, but its doctrinal core has experienced few changes. In this respect Guti√©rrez Mellado's real merit was to establish the basis for the spectacular transformation of the Spanish Armed Forces which occurred during the last thirty years of the 20th century and which made them one of the most highly valued institutions in the opinion of the Spanish public, according to the Sociological Research Center (CIS) periodical surveys. \\\\- Website CIS Guti√©rrez Mellado's most popular image is that at the Spanish Congress of the Deputies during the failed coup d'√©tat on February 23rd 1981, physically confronting the armed Guardia Civil troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Tejero. By mere chance, due to a simple oversight by a civil guard who did not notice that a TV camera was recording, every Spaniard had the chance to see live how a frail man, nearly seventy years old and unknown to most, jumped up from his parliamentary seat and, armed only with his words, faced up a dozen rebels armed with pistols and submachine guns. They tried to manhandle him down on to the floor but were unable to do so, whereupon they opened fire so as to avoid any further interruption of their criminal activities.Cercas, 2009 Television retransmission of his valiant defense of freedom would make Guti√©rrez Mellado into a legendary figure in post-Franco Spanish Politics. His singular and stoic effort in the face of armed revolt today remains an icon of the resolve of Spain's democratic government.  Last years  After resigning his governmental duties and having also retired voluntarily from the Army, to exemplify incompatibility of politics and a military career,.Real decreto 1753/1977: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 167 he refrained from public activities till President Felipe Gonz√°lez gave him a permanent seat on the State Council on May 28, 1984, where he chaired the First Section, which dealt with Defense Affairs.Real decreto 1140/1984: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 146 On September 1986, deeply touched by the death of close friend's son from a drug overdose, he sought the aid and financial help of several relevant businessmen and established the Antidrug Aid Foundation (FAD) that he chaired and ruled until the very day of his death. \\\\- Website FAD The main FAD objective was to mobilize citizenship to aid youngsters to overcome drug addiction at a time when heroin was wreaking havoc in Western countries. Apart from trying to alleviate the effects of drugs and repress its trafficking and consumption, its founder wanted society to give teenagers strong moral backup to repel them and to be brave enough to answer ‚ÄúNo thank you‚Äù if tempted, as could be read on their posters during their first publicity campaign. In the years prior to his death, different Spanish Universities and Colleges opened their doors to listen to Guti√©rrez Mellado lecturing about democratic transition or about FAD activities. In 1994, King Juan Carlos I rewarded him with the hereditary title of Marquess of Guti√©rrez-Mellado; the Parliament, with the Constitutional Order, and the Army High Council unanimously proposed Felipe Gonzalez's last Government to invest him with the honorary rank of Captain-General.Real decreto 1104/1994: Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado, 127 In September, 1994, dressed for the first and last time in his Captain General's uniform, he received the homage of General Military Academy cadets at the same yard where, sixty-five years before, he had committed his life to defending the Spanish flag.http://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/view.php?pid=bibliuned:IUGM-DocGGM-19951215 Fourteen months later, on December 15, 1995, ice on the road surface caused a fatal accident involving the car in which the eighty-three-year-old man was driving on his way to Barcelona to lecture at Ramon Llull University. \\\\- Website URLhttp://e-spacio.uned.es/fez/view.php?pid=bibliuned:IUGM- DocGGM-19951215 His funeral was held at the Army Headquarters, attended by the King and Queen of Spain, and he was buried at the cemetery of Villaviciosa de Od√≥n.

Its history is divided into successive reigns by three royal dynasties: Orontid (321 BC‚Äì200 BC),Mach Chahin (2001). Kingdom of Armenia. Surrey: Routledge. p185‚Äì190. Artaxiad (189 BC‚Äì12 AD) and Arsacid (52‚Äì428). The root of the kingdom lies in one of the satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia called Armenia (Satrapy of Armenia), which was formed from the territory of the Kingdom of Ararat (860 BC‚Äì590 BC) after it was conquered by the Median Empire in 590 BC. The satrapy became a kingdom in 321 BC during the reign of the Orontid dynasty after the conquest of Persia by Alexander the Great, which was then incorporated as one of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Seleucid Empire. Under the Seleucid Empire (312‚Äì63 BC), the Armenian throne was divided in two ‚Äì Armenia Maior and Sophene ‚Äì both of which passed to members of the Artaxiad dynasty in 189 BC. During the Roman Republic's eastern expansion, the Kingdom of Armenia, under Tigranes the Great, reached its peak, from 83 to 69 BC, after it reincorporated Sophene and conquered the remaining territories of the falling Seleucid Empire, effectively ending its existence and raising Armenia into an empire for a brief period, until it was itself conquered by Rome in 69 BC. The remaining Artaxiad kings ruled as clients of Rome until they were overthrown in 12 AD due to their possible allegiance to Rome's main rival in the region, Parthia. During the Roman‚ÄìParthian Wars, the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia was founded when Tiridates I, a member of the Parthian Arsacid dynasty, was proclaimed King of Armenia in 52. Throughout most of its history during this period, Armenia was heavily contested between Rome and Parthia, and the Armenian nobility was divided among pro-Roman, pro-Parthian or neutrals. From 114 to 118, Armenia briefly became a province of the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan. The Kingdom of Armenia often served as a client state or vassal at the frontier of the two large empires and their successors, the Byzantine and Sassanid empires. In 301, Tiridates III proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia, making the Armenian kingdom the first state to embrace Christianity officially. During the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian wars, Armenia was ultimately partitioned into Byzantine Armenia in 387 and Persian Armenia in 428. History =Origins= The geographic Armenian Highlands, then known as the highlands of Ararat (Assyrian: Urartu), was originally inhabited by Proto-Armenian tribes which did not yet constitute a unitary state or nation. The highlands were first united by tribes in the vicinity of Lake Van into the Kingdom of Van (Urartian: Biainili). The kingdom competed with Assyria over supremacy in the highlands of Ararat and the Fertile Crescent. Both kingdoms fell to Iranian invaders from the neighbouring East (Medes, followed by Achaemenid Persians) in the 6th century BC. Its territory was reorganized into a satrapy called Armenia (Old Persian: Armina, Elamite: Harminuya, Akkadian: Urashtu). The Orontid dynasty ruled as satraps of the Achaemenid Empire for three centuries until the empire's defeat against Alexander the Great's Macedonian Empire at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, a Macedonian general named Neoptolemus obtained Armenia until he died in 321 BC and the Orontids returned, not as satraps, but as kings. =Orontid dynasty= Orontes III and the ruler of Lesser Armenia, Mithridates, recognized themselves independent, thus elevating the former Armenian satrapy into a kingdom, giving birth to the kingdoms of Armenia and Lesser Armenia. Orontes III also defeated the Thessalian commander Menon, who wanted to capture Sper's gold mines. Weakened by the Seleucid Empire which succeeded the Macedonian Empire, the last Orontid king, Orontes IV, was overthrown in 200/201 BC and the kingdom was taken over by a commander of the Seleucid Empire, Artashes I, who is presumed to be related to the Orontid dynasty himself. =Artaxiad dynasty= Tigran II's Great Armenia Map of Armenia and the Roman client states in eastern Asia Minor, ca. 50 AD, before the Roman‚ÄìParthian War and the annexation of the client kingdoms into the Empire The Seleucid Empire's influence over Armenia had weakened after it was defeated by the Romans in the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC. A Hellenistic Armenian state was thus founded in the same year by Artaxias I alongside the Armenian kingdom of Sophene led by Zariadres. Artaxias seized Yervandashat, united the Armenian Highlands at the expense of neighboring tribes and founded the new royal capital of Artaxata near the Araxes River. According to Strabo and Plutarch, Hannibal Barca received hospitality at the Armenian court of Artaxias I. The authors add an apocryphal story of how Hannibal planned and supervised the building of Artaxata.Bournoutian, George A. (2006). A Concise History of the Armenian People: From Ancient Times to the Present. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda, p. 29. . The new city was laid on a strategic position at the juncture of trade routes that connected the Ancient Greek world with Bactria, India and the Black Sea which permitted the Armenians to prosper. Tigranes the Great saw an opportunity for expansion in the constant civil strife to the south. In 83 BC, at the invitation of one of the factions in the interminable civil wars, he entered Syria, and soon established himself as ruler of Syria‚Äîputting the Seleucid Empire virtually at an end‚Äîand ruled peacefully for 17 years. During the zenith of his rule, Tigranes the Great extended Armenia's territory outside of the Armenian Highland over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now south-eastern Turkey, Iran, Syria and Lebanon, becoming one of the most powerful states in the Roman East. =Roman rule= Roman coin of 141 AD, showing emperor Antoninus Pius holding a crown on the Armenia King's head Armenia came under the Ancient Roman sphere of influence in 66 BC, after the battle of Tigranocerta and the final defeat of Armenia's ally, Mithridates VI of Pontus. Mark Antony invaded and defeated the kingdom in 34 BC, but the Romans lost hegemony during the Final War of the Roman Republic in 32‚Äì30 BC. In 20 BC, Augustus negotiated a truce with the Parthians, making Armenia a buffer zone between the two major powers. Augustus installed Tigranes V as king of Armenia in AD 6, but ruled with Erato of Armenia. The Romans then installed Mithridates of Armenia as client king. Mithridates was arrested by Caligula, but later restored by Claudius. Subsequently, Armenia was often a focus of contention between Rome and Parthia, with both major powers supporting opposing sovereigns and usurpers. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission in AD 37, but in AD 47 the Romans retook control of the kingdom. In AD 51 Armenia fell to an Iberian invasion sponsored by Parthia, led by Rhadamistus. Tigranes VI of Armenia ruled from AD 58, again installed by Roman support. The period of turmoil ends in AD 66, when Tiridates I of Armenia was crowned king of Armenia by Nero. For the remaining duration of the Armenian kingdom, Rome still considered it a client kingdom de jure, but the ruling dynasty was of Parthian extraction, and contemporary Roman writers thought that Nero had de facto yielded Armenia to the Parthians.Redgate, Anne Elizabeth (2000). The Armenians (First ed.). Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers Inc. pp. 88‚Äì91. . =Arsacid dynasty= Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign (55‚Äì63) against the Parthian Empire, which had invaded the Kingdom of Armenia, allied with the Romans. After gaining Armenia in 60, then losing it in 62, the Romans sent the Legio XV Apollinaris from Pannonia to Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo, legatus of Syria. In 63, strengthened further by the legions III Gallica, V Macedonica, X Fretensis and XXII, General Corbulo entered into the territories of Vologases I of Parthia, who then returned the Armenian kingdom to Tiridates, king Vologases I's brother. Another campaign was led by Emperor Lucius Verus in 162‚Äì165, after Vologases IV of Parthia had invaded Armenia and installed his chief general on its throne. To counter the Parthian threat, Verus set out for the east. His army won significant victories and retook the capital. Sohaemus, a Roman citizen of Armenian heritage, was installed as the new client king. But during an epidemic within the Roman forces, Parthians retook most of their lost territory in 166. Sohaemus retreated to Syria, and the Arsacid's dynasty was restored to power over Armenia. After the fall of the Arsacid dynasty in Persia, the succeeding Sasanian Empire aspired to reestablish Persian control. The Sassanid Persians occupied Armenia in 252. However, in 287, Tiridates III the Great was established King of Armenia by the Roman armies. After Gregory the Illuminator's spreading of Christianity in Armenia, Tiridates accepted Christianity and made it his kingdom's official religion. The traditional date for Armenia's conversion to Christianity is established at 301, preceding the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great's conversion and the Edict of Milan by a dozen years. In 387, the Kingdom of Armenia was split between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Persian Empire. Western Armenia first became a province of the Roman Empire under the name of Armenia Minor, and later Byzantine Armenia; Eastern Armenia remained a kingdom within Persia until, in 428, the local nobility overthrew the king, and the Sassanids installed a governor in his place, beginning the Marzpanate period over Persian Armenia. Those parts of historical Armenia remained firmly under Persian control until the Muslim conquest of Persia, while the Byzantine parts remained until being conquered, also by invading Arabic armies, in the 7th century. In 885, after years of Roman, Persian, and Arab rule, Armenia regained its independence under the Bagratuni dynasty. Army =Under Tigranes the Great= The army of the Kingdom of Armenia reached its peak under the reign of Tigranes the Great. According to the author of Judith, his army included chariots and 12,000 cavalrymen, most likely heavy cavalry or cataphracts, a unit also commonly used by Seleucids and Parthians. His army consisted mainly of 120,000 infantrymen and 12,000 mounted archers, also an important feature of the Parthian army. Like the Seleucids, the bulk of Tigranes' army were foot soldiers. The Jewish historian Josephus talks of 500,000 men in total, including camp followers. These followers consisted of camels, donkeys, and mules used for baggage, sheep, cattle, and goats for food, said to be stocked in abundance for each man, and hoards of gold and silver. As a result, the marching Armenian army was listed as \\"a huge, irregular force, too many to count, like locusts or the dust of the earth\\", not unlike many other enormous Eastern armies of the time. The smaller Cappadocian, Graeco-Phoenician, and Nabataean armies were generally no match for the sheer number of soldiers, with the organized Roman army with its legions eventually posing a much greater challenge to the Armenians. Note that the numbers given by Israelite historians of the time were probably exaggerated, considering the fact that the Hasmonean Jews lost the war against Tigranes. =Ayrudzi= From ancient times in Armenia there existed \\"Azatavrear\\" cavalry which consisted of the Armenian elite. \\"Azatavrear\\" cavalry made up the main part of the Armenian king's court. In medieval times \\"Azatavrear\\" cavalry were collected from nobles (usually the youngest sons of Armenian lords), and were known as Ayrudzi, or \\"horsemen.\\" During times of peace, Armenian cavalry were divided into small groups which took the roles of guarding the King and other Armenian lords, as well as their families. Some part of the Armenian cavalry force was always patrolling Armenian borders, under the command of an Armenian general (sparapet). The group of Armenian cavalry whose main mission was the protection of the Armenian king and his family consisted of 6000 heavily armored horsemen in the ancient period, and 3000 horsemen in the medieval period. During times of war, the number of Armenian cavalry would rise, with estimates ranging from 10,000 to at least 20,000 horsemen. Besides heavy cavalry, there was also light cavalry, which primarily consisted of mounted archers. =Legio I Armeniaca-Armenian First Legion= \\"Legio Armeniaca\\" translates from Latin as \\"Armenian Legion\\" and \\"prima\\" as \\"first\\". The Armenian First Legion was one of the later-period Roman imperial legions. This Legion was mentioned in the late-antique text known as Notitia Dignitatum. It is most likely that the Armenian First Legion was formed in the 2nd or 3rd century AD, in the western part of the Kingdom, with the mission to protect the lands of Armenia from intrusion. It might first have been the garrison of Armenian lands which had been under the control of the Roman Empire. The Armenian First Legion took part in the ill-fated Persian campaign of the emperor Julianus Apostata in 363. =Legio II Armeniaca-Armenian Second Legion= \\"Legio Armeniaca\\" translates from Latin as \\"Armenian Legion\\" and \\"Secunda\\" as \\"Second\\". Like the First legion, the Armenian Second Legion was one of the later-period Roman imperial legions. This legion is also mentioned in the Notitia Dignitatum. The Armenian Second Legion was thought to have been created around the end of the 3rd century or in the beginning of the 4th century. The Armenian Second Legion had a permanent camp in one of the Northern provinces of the Orient, and built a camp in Satala. The Armenian Second legion is mentioned in the year 360 AD as a part of the garrison of Bezabda (anciently called Phoencia) in upper Tigris. In Bezabde the Armenian Second Legion served together with the Legions Parthica and II Flavia. In 390 AD Bezabde was taken by the Persian army, and a terrible bloodbath ensued against the inhabitants and garrison. The legion seemed to have survived this battle, because it appears in Notitia Dignitatum, which was written in the 5th century. Later on, the Armenian Second legion became a part of the Byzantine army. Mythology and pre-Christian religion The pre-Christian Armenian pantheon included: * Aramazd - Cognate of the Iranian Ahura Mazda (or Ormazd). Head of the pantheon, identified with Zeus in the interpretatio graeca. * Amanor and/or Vanatur - God of the Armenian new year, Navasard, at the end of July. His temple was located in Diyadin. * Anahit - Cognate of the Iranian Anahita. The goddess of fertility and birth, and daughter or wife of Aramazd, Anahit is identified with Artemis and Aphrodite. Temples dedicated to Anahit were established in Armavir, Artashat, Ashtishat. * Ara the Beautiful - a dying-and-rising god slain in a war against Semiramis. * Astghik - Cognate of the Semitic Ishtar. Fertility goddess and consort of Vahagn, sharing a temple with him at Derik. The holiday of Vardavar was originally in honor of Astghik. * Barsamin - God of sky and weather, probably derived from the Semitic god Baal Shamin. * Hayk - Legendary forefather of the Armenian people, archer, and slayer of the Titan Bel. * Mihr - Cognate with the Persian Mithra. God of the sun and light, son of Aramazd, the brother of Anahit and Nane. His center of worship was located in Bagaharich, and the temple of Garni was dedicated to him. * Nane - Possible cognate of the Sumerian Nanaya. Daughter of Aramazd, war and motherhood goddess. Her cult was related to Anahit, both of their temples located near each other in Gavar. * Tir or Tiur - God of wisdom, culture, science and studies, he also was an interpreter of dreams. He was the messenger of the gods and was associated with Apollo. Tir's temple was located near Artashat. * Tsovinar - Also called Nar, she was the goddess of rain, sea and water, though she was actually a fiery being who forced rain to fall. * Vahagn - Cognate of the Iranian Verethragna. The storm god and herculean dragon slayer. Derik housed the central temple to Vahagn. During the 1st century AD, Christianity spread through Armenia due to (according to legend) the efforts of the apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus. After persecutions by kings Sanatruk, Axidares, Khosrov I, and Tiridates III, Christianity was adopted as the state religion by Tiridates III after he was converted by Gregory the Illuminator. Armenia's adoption of Christianity as the state religion (the first country to do so) distinguished it from Parthian and Mazdaen influence. =Zoroastrianism= Until the late Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land. With the advent of Christianity, both paganism and Zoroastrianism gradually started to diminish. The founder of the Arsacid branch in Armenia, Tiridates I was a Zoroastrian priest or magus. A noted episode which illustrates the observance by the Armenian Arsacids is the famous journey of Tiridates I to Rome in A.D. 65‚Äì66. With the adoption of Christianity in the early 4th century, Zoroastrianism's influence in the kingdom gradually started to decline. Literature Little is known about pre-Christian Armenian literature. Many literature pieces known to us were saved and then presented to us by Moses of Chorene. This is a pagan Armenian song, telling about the birth of Vahagn: Armenian version ‘µ÷Ä’Ø’∂’ß÷Ä ’•÷Ä’Ø’´’∂, ’•÷Ä’Ø’∂’ß÷Ä ’•÷Ä’Ø’´÷Ä, ‘µ÷Ä’Ø’∂’ß÷Ä ÷á ’Æ’∏’æ’∂ ’Æ’´÷Ä’°’∂’´, ‘µ÷Ä’Ø’∂ ’´ ’Æ’∏’æ’∏÷Ç’∂ ’∏÷Ç’∂’ß÷Ä ÷á ’¶’Ø’°÷Ä’¥÷Ä’´’Ø’∂ ’•’≤’•’£’∂’´’Ø÷â ‘∏’∂’§ ’•’≤’•’£’°’∂ ÷É’∏’≤ ’Æ’∏÷Ç’≠ ’•’¨’°’∂’ß÷Ä, ‘∏’∂’§ ’•’≤’•’£’°’∂ ÷É’∏’≤ ’¢’∏÷Å ’•’¨’°’∂’ß÷Ä, ‘µ÷Ç ’´ ’¢’∏÷Å’∏’µ’∂ ’æ’°’¶’ß÷Ä ’≠’°÷Ä’ø’•’°’∑ ’∫’°’ø’°’∂’•’Ø’´’Ø÷â ’Ü’° ’∞’∏÷Ç÷Ä ’∞’•÷Ä ’∏÷Ç’∂’ß÷Ä, ‘≤’∏÷Å ’∏÷Ç’∂’ß÷Ä ’¥÷Ö÷Ä’∏÷Ç’Ω, ‘µ÷Ç ’°’π÷Ñ’∏÷Ç’∂÷Ñ’∂ ’ß’´’∂ ’°÷Ä’•’£’°’Ø’∏÷Ç’∂÷Ñ÷â Translation In travail were heaven and earth, In travail, too, the purple sea, The travail held in the sea the small red reed.

Language Before the Armenian alphabet was created, Armenians used the Aramaic and Greek alphabets, the last of which had a great influence on the Armenian alphabet. The Armenian alphabet was created by Saint Mesrop Mashtots and Isaac of Armenia (Sahak Partev) in AD 405, primarily for a Bible translation into the Armenian language. Traditionally, the following phrase translated from Solomon's Book of Proverbs is said to be the first sentence to be written down in Armenian by Mashtots: Mesrop Mashtots, the creator of Armenian Alphabet, by Francesco Maggiotto (1750‚Äì1805) By the 2nd century BC, according to Strabo, the inhabitants of Greater Armenia spoke the Armenian language, implying that modern Armenians descended from that population. Alt URL Capitals * Yervandashat ‚Äì The ancient town sits upon an escarpment overlooking the junction of the Arax River and Akhurian River. According to Movses Kaghankatvatsi, Orontes IV founded Yervandashat to replace Armavir as his capital after Armavir had been left dry by a shift of the Arax. The archaeological site has not been subject of major research, but fortifications and some remains of palaces have been uncovered. Ancient Yervandashat was destroyed by the army of the Persian King Shapur II in the 360s. * Artashat ‚Äì King Artashes I founded Artashat in 185 BC in the region of Vostan within the historical province of Ayrarat (Ararat), at the point where the Araks river was joined by the Metsamor river during the ancient era, near the heights of Khor Virap. The story of the foundation is given by the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi of the 5th century: \\"Artashes traveled to the location of the confluence of the Yeraskh and Metsamor [rivers] and taking a liking to the position of the hills (adjacent to Mount Ararat), he chose it as the location of his new city, naming it after himself.\\" Movses Khorenatsi. History of Armenia, 5th Century (’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Å ’ä’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂, ‘µ ‘¥’°÷Ä). Annotated translation and commentary by Stepan Malkhasyants. Gagik Sargsyan (ed.) Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1997, 2.49, p. 164. . According to the accounts given by Greek historians Plutarch and Strabo, Artashat is said to have been chosen and developed on the advice of the Carthaginian general Hannibal. The city's strategic position in the Araks valley on the Silk Road soon made Artashat a centre of bustling economic activity and thriving international trade, linking Persia and Mesopotamia with the Caucasus and Asia Minor. Its economic wealth can be gauged in the numerous bathhouses, markets, workshops, and administrative buildings that sprang up during the reign of Artashes I. The city had its own treasury and customs. The amphitheatre of Artashat was built during the reign of king Artavasdes II (55‚Äì34 BC). The remains of the huge walls surrounding the city built by King Artashes I can still be found in the area. After losing its status as a capital, Artashat gradually lost its significance. * Tigranakert was founded by the Armenian emperor Tigranes the Great in the 1st century BC. Tigranakert was founded as the new capital of the Armenian Empire in order to be in a more central position within the boundaries of the expanding empire. Its population was 120,000 and it also had many temples and an amphitheater. * Vagharshapat ‚Äì In the first half of the 1st century, during the reign of the Armenian Arshakuni king Vologases I (Vagharsh I) (117‚Äì144), the old town of Vardgesavan was renovated and renamed Vaghasrhapat (’é’°’≤’°÷Ä’∑’°’∫’°’ø), which still persists as the official appellation of the city. The original name, as preserved by Byzantine historian Procopius (Persian Wars), was Valashabad‚Äî\\"Valash/Balash city\\" named after king Balash/Valash/Valarsh of Armenia. The name evolved into its later form by the shift in the medial L into a Gh, which is common in Armenian language. Khorenatsi mentions that the town of Vardges was totally rebuilt and fenced by Vagharsh I, eventually becoming known as Noarakaghak (The New City) or Vagharshapat. The city served as a capital for the Ashakuni Kingdom of Armenia between 120 and 330 AD and remained the country's most important city until the end of the 4th century. When Christianity became the state religion of Armenia, Vagharshapat was eventually called Ejmiatsin (or Etchmiadzin), after the name of the Mother Cathedral. Starting in 301, the city became the spiritual centre of the Armenian nation, home to the Armenian Catholicosate, one of the oldest religious organizations in the world. Vagharshapat was home to one of the oldest schools established by Saint Mashtots and the home of the first manuscripts library in Armenia founded in 480 AD. Starting in the 6th century, the city slowly lost its importance‚Äîespecially after the transfer of the seat of the Catholicosate to Dvin in 452‚Äîuntil the foundation of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in 885. After the fall of the Bagratid dynasty in 1045, the city gradually became an insignificant place until 1441, when the seat of the Armenian Catholicosate was transferred from the Cilician town of Sis back to Etchmiadzin. * Dvin ‚Äì The ancient city of Dvin was built by Khosrov III the Small in 335 on the site of an ancient settlement and fortress from the 3rd millennium BC. Since then the city had been used as the primary residence of the Armenian kings of the Arshakuni dynasty. Dvin had a population of about 100,000 citizens of various professions including arts and crafts, trade, fishing, etc. After the fall of the Armenian Kingdom in 428, Dvin became the residence of Sassanid-appointed marzpans (governors), Byzantine kouropalates and later Umayyad and Abbasid-appointed ostikans (governors), all of whom were of senior nakharar stock. In 640 Dvin was the center of the emirate of Armenia. Political geography The Kingdom of Armenia was bordered by Caucasian Albania in the east, Caucasian Iberia in the north, the Roman Empire in the west, and Parthia, later succeeded by Sassanian Empire, in the south. The border between Caucasian Iberia and the Kingdom of Armenia was the Kur river, which was also the border between Caucasian Albania and Kingdom of Armenia. After 331 BC, Armenia was divided into Lesser Armenia (a region of the Kingdom of Pontus), the Kingdom of Armenia (corresponding to Armenia Major) and the Kingdom of Sophene. In 189 BC when Artashes I's reign began, many neighboring countries (Media, Caucasian Iberia, Seleucid Empire) exploiting the weakened state of the kingdom, conquered its remote regions. Strabo says that Artaxias I raided to the east and reunited Caspiane and Paytakaran, then raided to the north, defeated the Iberians, reuniting Gugark (Strabo also notes that Iberia recognized themselves as vassals of the Kingdom of Armenia at this time), to the west, reuniting Karin, Ekeghik and Derjan and to the south, where, after many battles with the Seleucid Empire, he reunited Tmorik. Artaxias I was not able to reunite Lesser Armenia, Corduene, and Sophene, something completed by his grandson Tigranes the Great. During Artaxias I's reign the Kingdom of Armenia covered . At its peak, under Tigranes the Great, it covered , incorporating, besides Armenia Major, Iberia, Albania, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Armenian Mesopotamia, Osroene, Adiabene, Syria, Assyria, Commagene, Sophene, Judea and Atropatene. Parthia and also some Arab tribes were vassals of Tigranes the Great. Lesser Armenia's area was . =Provinces= Regions of Greater Armenia (Arsacid Armenia). Historical provinces of Greater Armenia The 15 provinces of the Kingdom of Armenia with their capitals are as follows: * Upper Armenia, (Garin) * Sophene; (Arsamosata) * Aghdznik; (Tigranakert) * Turuberan; (Manzikert) * Corduene; (Pinik) * Moxoene; (Moks) * Nor Shirakan; (Her) * Vaspurakan; (Van) * Syunik; (Baghaberd) * Artsakh; (Shusha) * Paytakaran; (Paytakaran) * Utik; (Partav) * Gugark; (Ardahan) * Tayk; (Olti) * Ayrarat; (Armavir) Other Armenian regions: * Lesser Armenia; (Nikopolis) * Armenian Mesopotamia; (Edessa) Maps File:East-Hem 323bc.jpg|World in 323 BC File:East-Hem 200bc.jpg|World in 200 BC File:East-Hem 100bc.jpg|World in 100 BC File:Orontid Armenia -250-en.svg|Orontid Armenia File:Maps of the Armenian Empire of Tigranes.gif|Armenian Empire under Tigranes the Great File:Arshakuni Armenia 150-en.svg|Arshakuni Armenia in 150 AD File:Persian Armenia.gifPersian Armenia File:Map of Byzantine Armenia, 387-536.gif|Byzantine Armenia References  Sources     Further reading  * M.

Even though the Soviet Union itself was dissolved a mere 15 months later, the .su top-level domain remains in use today with over 100,000 .su domains . It is administered by the Russian Institute for Public Networks (RIPN, or RosNIIROS in Russian transcription).  History  After 1989 a set of new internet domains was created in Europe, including .pl (Poland), .cs (Czechoslovakia), .yu (Yugoslavia) and .dd (East Germany). Among them there was also a domain for the USSR ‚Äì .su. Initially, before two-letter ccTLDs became standard, the Soviet Union was to receive a .ussr domain. The .su domain was proposed by the 19-year-old Finnish student Petri Ojala. On 26 December 1991 the country formally ceased to exist and its constituent republics gained independence, which should have caused the domain to begin a phase-out process, as happened with those of East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Until 1994 there was no assigned top-level domain name for Russia. For this reason the country continued to use the Soviet domain. In 1994 the .ru domain was created, which is supposed to eventually replace the .su domain (domains for the republics other than Russia were created at different times in the mid-nineties). The domain was supposed to be withdrawn by ICANN, but it was kept at the request of the Russian government and Internet users. In 2001, the managers of the domain stated that they would commence accepting new .su registrations, but it is unclear whether this action was compatible with ICANN policies. ICANN has expressed intentions to terminate the .su domain and IANA states that the domain is being phased out,.su Domain Delegation Data IANA but lobbyists stated in September 2007 that they had started negotiations with ICANN on retaining the domain. In the first quarter of 2008, .su registrations increased by 45%.Back in the USSR: Soviet Internet domain name resists death, Mansur Mirovalev, writing for Associated Press, 18 April 2008  Usage  The domain was intended to be used by Soviet institutions and companies operating in the USSR. Despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the superseding of the TLD by the new country TLDs of the republics that gained independence, it is still in use as of 2020. Most of the .su domains are registered in Russia and the United States. According to the RU-CENTER data from May 2010, there were over 93,500 registered domains with the .su TLD (there are over 2.8 million .ru domains). Among the institutions still using this domain is the Russian pro-Vladimir Putin youth movement Nashi, as well as by the pro-Russian armed insurgency in Eastern Ukraine. Some organizations with roots in the former Soviet Union also still use this TLD. The domain has been reported to host many cybercrime activities due to the lax, outdated terms of use, and staying out of focus (2% usage comparing to the primary .ru zone). Rules for timely suspension of malicious domains have been in place since 2013. The pro-Russian separatist group Donetsk People's Republic have also registered their domain with the TLD.

It used a reverse domain name notation.  History  It was proposed in 1983 and used until the superficially similar Internet Domain Name System was fully adopted.  Structure  The NRS \\"second-level domains\\" consisted of \`UK.AC\` (JANET academic and scientific sites), \`UK.CO\` (commercial) and \`UK.MOD\` (Ministry of Defence). Any organisations not falling into these categories were given their own \\"second-level\\" name, e.g. \`UK.BL\` (British Library) or \`UK.NEL\` (National Engineering Laboratory). All NRS names had both a standard (long) and abbreviated (up to 18 characters) form. For example, \`UK.AC.CAMBRIDGE\` was the less widely used standard equivalent of the abbreviated name \`UK.AC.CAM\`. For email, interoperability between the \\"Grey Book\\" email addressing style of \`user@UK.AC.SITE\` and ARPA and USENET addresses of the style \`user@site.ac.uk\` was achieved by way of mail gateway at University College London.  Comparison with DNS  A principal difference with the Domain Name System was that the order of significance began with the most significant part (so called big-endian addresses). Also, NRS names were canonically written in upper case. For example, the University of Cambridge had the NRS name \`UK.AC.CAM\`, whereas its DNS domain is \`cam.ac.uk\`. After Internet country-code top-level domains were introduced from 1984, confusion was caused when the least significant part of an Internet address matched the most significant part of an NRS address and vice versa. The ccTLD \\".cs\\" for Czechoslovakia came into use around 1990-2 until 1995. The classic joke was that e-mail intended for UK universities ended up in Czechoslovakia, since many JANET e-mail addresses were of the form \`user@UK.AC.\`universityname\`.CS\`, where \\"CS\\" stood for Computer Science (department). Another significant difference from the DNS was the concept of context to name lookups, e.g. 'mail' or 'file transfer'. This made the NRS more sophisticated than the DNS, permitting overloading of names.  Legacy  JANET transitioned to using Internet protocols in 1991, and by 1994 the DNS had become the de facto standard for domain names on JANET. The final mail gateway was taken out of service by the end of 1997. The one remaining legacy of the NRS is the convention of using .uk for British DNS domains, rather than .gb as specified by ISO 3166.

It was released on March 1, 2001, in Japan, and later that month for North America and Europe. The game is based around mecha combat in outer space. Over the course of the game, the player obtains new weapons and has to protect towns from enemies. The story is set in the space around Jupiter and follows a young colonist named Leo Stenbuck, one of the few survivors from his colony after it was attacked by the military force BAHRAM. The player controls the Orbital Frame known as Jehuty. Surviving using a mecha, Leo is on a mission to return Jehuty to the Space Force and uses the Frame to protect civilians. The game was created with the intention of having a more serious and realistic focus on the mecha genre. The mechas were designed by Yoji Shinkawa, the character and mechanical designer for the Metal Gear series. The critical reaction to Zone of the Enders was positive. While the combat and graphics were generally well received, its short length and poor localization were the areas most commonly receiving criticism. The game spawned two follow-ups: The Fist of Mars, a spin-off for the Game Boy Advance, and The 2nd Runner, a direct sequel for the PlayStation 2. The Japanese animation studio Sunrise also produced two works related to Zone of the Enders. The game was re- released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 alongside its direct sequel, Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner, in October 2012 as part of the Zone of the Enders HD Collection. Gameplay Jehuty defeats an enemy Raptor with its blade. The green bar shows Jehuty's health while the top shows the remaining enemies. Zone of the Enders is a hack and slash and third-person shooter game in which the player takes follows Leo Steanbuck, a child who becomes the pilot of the advanced mecha, or Frame, known as Jehuty. Jehuty is capable of three- dimensional movement, flying, and hovering. Leo uses Jehuty to travers across different areas of a space colony orbiting Jupiter while attacking rogue Orbital Frames using its advanced weaponry. In some stages of the story, there is also the objective of minimizing damage to nearby buildings and civilians, encouraging more strategic combat. Players are given ranked depending on how many buildings and civilians were destroyed or spared. This grading affects the ending sequence outcome. Additionally, the player is given options to first take different areas where to fight in order to avoid linearity. In order to restore Jehuty's health, an item known as Metatron Ore can be found and used in every area. In battle, Jehuty locks-on to a single enemy Frame and is able to perform advanced maneuvers such as grabbing and throwing enemies, deploying an energy shield, and using booster jets to move quickly and dodge enemy attacks. It is equipped with an energy sword, an energy projectile, and various sub-weapons. As the player progresses, Jehuty's arsenal grows and its abilities expand by obtaining programs alongside their respective code. Every time Jehuty defeats an enemy it gains experience; after gaining a determined amount of experience, it levels up, improving most of its qualities. Upon completion of the game, a Versus Mode is unlocked. The player can use it to compete with the artificial intelligence (AI) bots or another player while controlling two Frames. Plot The game takes place in the year 2172; mankind has colonized Earth's, Mars', and Jupiter's moons. A military force known as BAHRAM sends its primary offensive unit to attack Antilia, a Jupiter colony, in an attempt to secure two advanced machines known as Orbital Frames. One of the few colony survivors, a young boy named Leo Stenbuck, witnesses a falling Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicle (LEV) killing his friends. He flees to a hangar, where he finds an Orbital Frame by the name of Jehuty. Using this suit and its built-in intelligence, A.D.A, he fends off the BAHRAM forces led by officer Viola who seek to claim Jehuty on the orders of their leader, Nohman. Leo is then contacted by Elena Weinberg, the commander of the civilian transport vessel Atlantis; it belongs to Earth's military forces, the United Nations Space Force. As Jehuty's original pilot died during the attack, Elena requests Leo's assistance to deliver Jehuty back to them so they can take it to Mars. Leo, however, refuses to kill enemies. Battling through Antilia, Leo rescues civilians, including Celvice Klein, a friend; he defends the colony from destruction, defeating the BAHRAM forces and their commanders one by one. Before reaching Atlantis, Leo encounters Viola, who seeks a rematch; Leo defeats her, but is unwilling to kill her. Later, Atlantis pilot Rock Thunderheart meets Leo in person, revealing that BAHRAM forces are still determined to obtain Jehuty and are threatening to destroy the colony. Thunderheart requests Leo's help to pilot Jehuty, as he has realized Leo's skills are superior. Viola then appears, shooting Celvice this time, forcing Leo to fight again. Celvice is taken to the Thunderheart to be treated while Leo goes to save the colony. Leo goes to the docks and Viola battles him once more. However, Viola is defeated again and killed when a leftover bomb blows her out of the colony and into Jupiter's atmosphere. Nohman himself then appears in Jehuty's superior twin Frame Anubis, forcing Jehuty's escape. As Jehuty is docking, A.D.A. reveals to Leo its programming: when taken to the fortress Aumaan on Mars, the mechas is to eject its pilot and self-destruct Jehuty, destroying the frame and the fortress. Leo leaves Jehuty's cockpit and meets up with the crew of the Atlantis and Celvice, who survived her gunshot wound. Development Zone of the Enders entered development for the PlayStation and PC, but in actuality Konami had no intentions of releasing them for those platforms. Early prototypes of the game were built on Dreamcast. The game's focus is on anime-style robots with an emphasis on realism compared to common sci-fi works. Development staff were advised by professionals who had done scientific research for other anime series. Director and scenario writer Noriaki Okamura wanted to write a serious story featuring people with complicated lives; its main theme examines the purpose and nature of life, as reflected in Leo's hardships during the game. To support this message, multiple endings for the main narrative were avoided, although side quests could feature different endings. Despite this, two other endings can be unlocked depending on the player's performance when protecting civilians. In contrast to other 3D games, the team worked to give players the sensation that they are controlling a fast robot; this demanded a year of camera work to achieve. Okamura designed Zone of the Enders to tell a story through gameplay sequences, rather than during cutscenes. As such, the staff focused on adding details such as the destroyed buildings to inform the player's objectives. Character designer Nobuyoshi Nishimura expressed difficulties in designing characters who would both fit the mechas and the 3D models. In order to take advantage of the 3D space, Nishimura sought to move the camera as often as possible. He tried not to \\"go overboard\\" during cutscenes to emphasize the appeal of the mechas during gameplay. During development of the game, producer Hideo Kojima assisted the team. Yoji Shinkawa was in charge of designing the Orbital Frames, the games mechas. Initially, the Frames were to feature unique transformations, but he determined that flying and skating with Jehuty was enjoyable on its own. As a joke, Shinkawa placed the cockpit in the Frames' crotch region. The staff first had the idea of naming a Frame Anubis based on Egyptian mythology; this led to the name Jehuty for the main Frame, a reference to the Egyptian deity, Djehuti. LEVs were intended to appear during the gameplay as weak, easy opponents that would target Jehuty and the Raptors; however, they ultimately appeared only during cutscenes. Zone of the Enders was originally set to release in Japan on February 1, 2001, but was delayed to March 1, 2001. The Japanese edition premium package contains an original video animation titled ZOE: 2167 IDOLO; produced by Sunrise, it is set five years before the events on the game. Okamura was satisfied with Sunrise's work, noting their experience in producing robot anime. During the animation's production, Shinkawa suggested a design for the titular Frame, IDOLO, to ensure style continuity between the animation and the video game. The English versions of Zone of the Enders were released on March 23, 2001 in Europe and March 27, 2001 in North America. They were originally sold packaged with a preview demo of the then-upcoming Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. The game's soundtrack was released in Japan on April 25, 2001 by Konami Music Entertainment. According to director Okamura, the music is calm during normal situations, with new tracks added in combat situations to increase the complexity of the music while fighting. The main theme, \\"Kiss Me Sunlights\\", was composed and performed by Heart of Air. Reception and legacy Zone of the Enders received generally positive responses, with an average score of a 78 out of 100 in Metacritic. The game's fighting system was praised for its use of 3D camerawork and Jehuty's fast movements. GamePro found it superior to the PlayStation 2's other mecha game released by the release, Armored Core 2 thanks to its responsive controls and quick combat. The visual design has also been praised as highly detailed. The game was critically acclaimed by Game Informer who remarked Zone of the Enders as one of the most appealing games and found its visuals as ones of the best ones ever found in the PlayStation 2 and added praise to its fighting. However, the presentation has been a major area of criticism; the game's localization was criticized, with the English script being regarded as repetitive and the voice acting \\"emotionless\\" by David Smith, writing for IGN. He also reported being annoyed by Leo's English voice acting. The story has been disliked by reviewers with Smith finding the main characters inferior to the ones from other mecha series such as Mobile Suit Gundam whereas Snackdawg from GameZone disliked the story as he stated that despite its dark parts such as the deaths of Leo's friends, his father and his friend being shot, it instead made everyone \\"simply seems whiny\\". While liking the game, Game Informer recommended players to skip the cutscenes. Despite these complaints, Smith considered it one of the best mecha games he had ever played. The combat was also considered too easy due to poor enemy AI, lack of variety, and an excessive number of tactical options, and the game has been found to be too short without an increase in challenge on higher difficulty settings. Gaming Age writer Patrick Klepek criticized the game's open ending, suggesting that the project had been rushed and that it would have been better to increase the game's length and fill in missing plot elements. Shawn Sanders felt the game verged on being \\"a better rental than purchase,\\" but that the included Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty demo made the game worth buying. The versus mode was better received, with Shane Satterfield from GameSpot praising its competitiveness and its accentuation of the singleplayer campaign's strengths with Gaming Age giving similar responses. On the other hand, GameZone criticized this mode stating it was not worth the wait to unlock it. Chester Barber reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is a great action game that any gamer will surely enjoy, despite its faults. Unless you simply hate anything with mechs, this is one game you shouldn't miss.\\" During 2001, it was the 81st bestselling game in Japan, with a total of 120,658 units sold. It was the sixth best selling game in North America during March 2001; sales were boosted by the inclusion of a demo for the highly-anticipated Metal Gear Solid 2. In June 2001, Konami announced a spin-off game titled Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars for the Game Boy Advance to be developed by Sunrise Interactive. Sunrise also produced an animated television series titled Z.O.E. Dolores,i in 2001. Although there were no plans for a sequel to the original game, in May 2002, Konami announced Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner; it was released for the PlayStation 2 in February 2003. To bridge the two games, Konami published an intersequel following Leo's activities with Atlantis and witnessing his growth as a pilot. Zone of the Enders was ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 alongside The 2nd Runner. A sequel to The 2nd Runner was announced in May 2012 as \\"The Enders Project,\\" but was cancelled a year later due to difficulty with the HD ports.

The letters refer to Timor Portugu√™s, or Portuguese Timor, a legacy from the nation's previous status as a Portuguese colony. The domain .tp was officially launched in December 1997 by connect.ie, an internet service provider based in Dublin, Ireland, in cooperation with the East Timorese authorities in absentia, while East Timor was under Indonesian authority. .tp remained active for the period of transition, although it now no longer complies with the ISO 3166-1 standard for the two-letter codes for the name of countries as the code for East Timor changed from TP to TL after independence. Regardless, it retained a number of domains until it was finally deleted in February 2015. The last listed change and update for .tp was on April 22, 2008. History In 1997, connect.ie discussed the potential of setting up a \\"virtual East Timor\\". They communicated these ideas to the East Timorese leadership and their representatives. This set in motion the acquisition the .tp domain (then the only available nomenclature for East Timor). After discussions with Jon Postel, IANA, it was realized that a set of necessary registration conditions would require to be met, including the provision of a local contact persons details. It was assumed by all parties in this discussion that there was a strong likelihood for a potential negative reaction to any person or indeed location listed for such purposes. After discussion with various East Timorese representatives, it was agreed that Xanana Gusm√£o, was at that time imprisoned in Jakarta, would be the appropriate contact person. The remaining issue and solution to providing local addressing and other contact details were provided by . A telephone call was made to Dili to identify the address and telephone number of the Military Governor, the last local location of Xanana Gusm√£o. These details were provided to and accepted by IANA. The .tp domain registry was successfully acquired and activated mainly for the purpose of \\"declaring independence\\" at least in the virtual world. The subsequent attack on the .tp domain registry gained extensive worldwide media coverage and public support. Within 6 days of this occurring, and much to everyone's surprise, President Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie announced that a referendum would be held in East Timor to choose between special autonomy and independence. This activity finally concluded when East Timor became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century on May 20, 2002. First \\"Internet\\" War During the 1999 East Timorese crisis the cctld server services for the '.tp' domain were attacked by hackers believed to be at the behest and with support from a faction of the Indonesian military. Connect Ireland also received malicious telephone calls and other communications at this time. Confusion In August 1999, before the holding of the referendum, one of the independence leaders Jos√© Ramos-Horta, a former President of East Timor, was purported to have stated that arrangements had been made for hackers to attack Indonesian sites. In response to these press reports, issued a statement in response to these purported reports condemning any use of hacking for any activity that would negatively impact on ordinary Indonesian citizens, stating that they (CI) were not at \\"war\\" with the Indonesian people and cited the support that they had received from many Indonesian people after the earlier attack on the .tp domain. Transition to .tl .tl is the ccTLD that now complies with the ISO 3166-1 standard. The Department of Information Technology in East Timor is working cooperatively with Connect Ireland to ensure a stable and secure transition to the .tl ccTLD. Existing registrants in the .tp ccTLD were initially granted the same domain in the .tl ccTLD at no cost for the first year of registration. Both the .tp and .tl \\"versions\\" continue to resolve and registrant information, whois data, and name server delegations were to be the same for both .tl and .tp, for legacy domains. As of June 2005, no further registrations were accepted in the .tp domain. Registration in .tl is available directly at second-level with no local presence requirement, through CoCCA and various resellers worldwide. In 2008, search engines found approximately twice as many pages in the .tp domain as in its successor, .tl . By October 2009, this ratio dropped to 1:8, .tl being the more dominant. As of 2013, the same metric reached an insignificant 1:10000 in favour of .tl. In 2015, the TLD was deactivated. Dated IANA information For a long time, according to the IANA site, .tl was listed as unassigned, with .tp still being listed for East Timor (Xanana Gusm√£o, a major political figure and former president, is the administrative contact). The Department of Information Technology in East Timor sent a letter to IANA requesting that this information be updated. As of September 30, 2005, the update had been made and .tl is listed as an active top-level domain.

After Serbia and Montenegro acquired separate .rs and .me domains in 2007, a transition period started, and the .yu domain finally expired on 30 March 2010. History The .yu ccTLD was assigned originally to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, during the government project for the development of scientific-technological information (SNTIJ). The official registrants were the University of Maribor and the Jo≈æef Stefan Institute, which were located in Slovenia. Computer scientist, Borka Jerman Bla≈æiƒç, registered the domain in 1989, which allowed Yugoslavia to have an Internet connection. When the SFR Yugoslavia dissolved, Slovenia and Croatia registered their own ccTLDs (.si and .hr). Serbia and Montenegro formed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but was under international sanctions at the time because of ongoing Yugoslav wars. The old .yu domain registry had been left in Slovenia, and the domain became a succession matter when the Slovenians refused to relinquish the domain name to the University of Belgrade in Serbia, which had requested they do so. In 1994, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority finally decreed that the domain should pass to FR Yugoslavia. After that, the domain was managed by the YUNET Association, an organization based in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the University of Belgrade. The FR Yugoslavia renamed itself Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003. The code YU was replaced by CS in July 2003 following the official name change, and the ccTLD .cs was reserved for Serbia and Montenegro after the name change. However, .cs was never actually used, and .yu remained one of the few ccTLDs that did not correspond to a current ISO 3166-1 two-letter code. The state union of Serbia and Montenegro was dissolved in July 2006, and in September 2006, ISO accordingly proposed the replacement the codes RS for Serbia and ME for Montenegro. On 26 September 2006 the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency agreed on the change of ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code CS to RS. The new domains .rs for Serbia and .me for Montenegro became active shortly thereafter. In September 2007 ICANN resolvedPreliminary Report for Special Meeting of the ICANN Board of Directors ICANN, 11 September 2007 that the .yu domain would be operated temporarily under the Serbian National Register of Internet Domain Names, operators of the new .rs domain registry. A two-year transition period started, and the .yu domain was scheduled to expire on 30 September 2009. However, the Serbian registrar requested an extension and ICANN decided to extend the transition deadline another six months away. Finally, the Serbian registrar declared the end of the .yu domain at 12:00 CEST on 30 March 2010. Former use of .yu domains All of the domains directly under .yu were reserved for legal entities only. Top level domain was reserved for federal institutions and official governmental institutions, as well as Internet service providers. The Serbian Orthodox Church was also allowed to use .yu domain. The second-level domains under .yu included: * Academic organizations, such as universities, were registered under the academic domain, .ac.yu. For example, the School of Electrical Engineering (.etf) at the University of Belgrade (.bg) had the etf.bg.ac.yu domain. * Educational institutions, such as primary and high schools, used the .edu.yu domain. * Independent organizations used the .org.yu domain. * Corporations used the .co.yu domain. * Government used the .gov.yu domain. Montenegrin websites often used subdomain .cg.yu which was given for free to customers of a Montenegrin ISP which registered the domain, making it a popular option for those who opt not to register a domain for their website.

The tripos includes a wide range of Natural Sciences from physics, astronomy, and geoscience, to chemistry and biology, which are taught alongside the history and philosophy of science. The tripos covers several courses which form the University of Cambridge system of Tripos. It is known for its broad range of study in the first year, in which students cannot study just one discipline, but instead must choose three courses in different areas of the natural sciences and one in mathematics. As is traditional at Cambridge, the degree awarded after Part II is a Bachelor of Arts (BA). A Master of Science degree (MSci) is available to those who take the optional Part III. It was started in the 19th Century. Teaching Teaching is carried out by 16 different departments. Subjects offered in Part IA in 2019 are Biology of Cells, Chemistry, Computer Science, Evolution and Behaviour, Earth Sciences, Materials Science, Mathematics, Physics, Physiology of Organisms and Mathematical Biology; students must take three experimental subjects and one mathematics course. There are three options for the compulsory mathematics element in IA: \\"Mathematics A\\", \\"Mathematics B\\" and \\"Mathematical Biology\\". From 2020 Computer Science will no longer be an option in the natural sciences course. Students specialize further in the second year (Part IB) of their Tripos, taking three subjects from a choice of twenty, and completely in their third year (Part II) in, for example, genetics or astrophysics, although general third year courses do exist ‚Äì Biomedical and Biological Sciences for biologists and Physical Sciences for chemists, physicists, etc. Fourth year options (Part III) are available in a number of subjects, and usually have an entry requirement of obtaining a 2:1 or a First in second year Tripos Examinations, and is applied for before the commencement of the third year. As of 2008, options with an available Part III option are: Astrophysics; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Geological Sciences; Materials Science and Metallurgy; and Experimental and Theoretical Physics. the tripos is delivered by sixteen different departments including: * The Department of Chemistry * The Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology * The Department of Genetics * The Department of Physics * The Department of Astronomy * The Department of Biochemistry * The Department of Pharmacology * The Department of Plant Sciences * The Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience * The Department of Zoology * The Department of Psychology * The Department of Computer Science and Technology * The Department of Earth Sciences * The Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy * The Department of History and Philosophy of Science Motivation The University of Cambridge believes that their course's generalisation, rather than specialisation, gives their students an advantage. First, it allows students to experience subjects at university level before specialising. Second, many modern sciences exist at the boundaries of traditional disciplines, for example, applying methods from a different discipline. Third, this structure allows other scientific subjects, such as Mathematics (traditionally a very strong subject at Cambridge), Medicine and the History and Philosophy of Science, (and previously Computer sciences before it had been removed for 2020 entry) to link with the Natural Sciences Tripos so that once, say, the two-year Part I of the Medical Sciences tripos has been completed, one can specialise in another biological science in Part II during one's third year, and still come out with a science degree specialised enough to move into postgraduate studies, such as a PhD. Student enrolment As a result of this structure, the Natural Sciences Tripos has by far the greatest number of students of any Tripos. Undergraduates who are reading for the NST in order to gain their degrees are colloquially known in University slang as 'NatScis (pronounced \\"Nat-Ski\\"'s), being broadly nicknamed physical science ('phys') or biological science ('bio') NatScis, according to their course choices. (Of course, many students choose both physical and biological options in first year.) The split tends to be about 50:50 between the physical and biological sciences. In 2018, 2594 students applied and 577 were admitted to the Natural Sciences Tripos.

The plot follows Casey Singleton, a quality assurance vice president at the fictional aerospace manufacturer Norton Aircraft, as she investigates an in- flight accident aboard a Norton-manufactured airliner that leaves three passengers dead and 56 injured. Airframe remains one of Crichton's few novels not adapted to film. Crichton stated this was due to the great expense needed to make such a film. Another consideration might be that the novel is so dense with technical references that it reads more like an accident investigation report than a suspense-filled page-turner for the general reader. Airframe is unlike many of Crichton's other works in that the story has almost no outright science fiction elements. Plot summary The novel opens aboard Hong Kong- based TransPacific Airlines Flight 545, a Norton Aircraft-manufactured N-22 wide-body aircraft, flying from Hong Kong to Denver. An incident occurs on board the plane about 1/2 hour west of the California coast, and the pilot requests an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport, stating that the plane encountered \\"severe turbulence\\" in flight. The pilot gives air traffic control conflicting information regarding the types and severity of injuries, but does inform them that crew members are hurt and \\"two passengers are dead.\\" The incident seems inexplicable. The N-22 is a plane with an excellent safety record, and the captain, John Zhen Chang, is highly skilled, making the possibility of human error unlikely. Passengers and flight crew give almost identical accounts of the circumstances of the disaster, and the most likely explanation turns out to be a technical problem that was thought to have been fixed years before. As Vice President of Quality Assurance at Norton Aircraft, it is Casey Singleton's job to try to protect the design's (and Norton's) reputation, especially since it jeopardizes a crucial aircraft purchase deal with China. However, not only does she have to deal with a ratings-hungry media intent on assigning blame for the incident, she must also deal with Bob Richman, an arrogant and suspicious Norton family member assigned to assist her. All the while, she has to navigate the murky politics of the factory union and try and soothe the tempers of disgruntled Norton workers who fear the fallout from the incident will bankrupt the company and cost them their jobs. When the company's Incident Review Team begins to investigate, they discover that the plane's Flight Data Recorder (FDR) had malfunctioned prior to the accident, and thus the data on any system errors or pilot control inputs is corrupted. Because Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVRs) are not allowed to store longer recordings due to Federal Aviation Administration restrictions, the CVR data from the time of the accident has also been lost. Without FDR and CVR data, the team is forced to go over every part and circuit of the aircraft to look for what might have caused the accident. At first, all signs point to a malfunction of the plane's slats having caused them to deploy mid-flight. Though other N-22s had exhibited similar slats errors in the past, they were thought to have been caused by pilots inadvertently snagging the control lever. Norton assumed that the slats problem had been fixed by its subsequent Airworthiness Directives (ADs) locking the lever into place and covering it when not in use. The team is anxious to prove that this was not the cause of the accident, because a slats malfunction despite both ADs' being fully implemented points to an underlying error that could make the N-22 unsafe to fly. Their search eventually uncovers a counterfeit part likely installed by a careless maintenance worker, but this would not have been enough to cause the accident on its own. Upon reviewing the plane's raw fault data printouts, Casey realizes that the plane was equipped with a Quick Access Recorder (QAR). A QAR provides even more detailed flight data than the FDR, but the team did not know the plane was equipped with one because QARs are optional. Casey locates the QAR on board the N-22, and she is able to piece together the events that caused the accident from the data it recorded. Contrary to public belief, the accident was caused not by a design flaw at Norton, but by an accident cascade stemming from poor maintenance practices at Transpacific Airlines and from pilot error. First, the counterfeit part caused a sensor in the plane's wing to malfunction, which produced an error message in the cockpit. This error message could be cleared by deploying and retracting the plane's slats. Although deploying the slats would change the shape of the wing, the N-22's autopilot was capable of making the necessary adjustments without incident. However, the pilot at the time of the accident manually overcorrected, overriding the autopilot and sending the plane into a series of oscillations that resulted in fatalities. Originally, this had been ruled out as a possible cause because the plane's captain, who was reportedly at the controls during the accident, was a highly capable pilot with ample experience flying the N-22. However, Casey noticed that Chang's son Thomas was listed as a member of the flight crew. Although Thomas was a pilot, he was not type certified to fly the N-22 and was thus unfamiliar with the particulars of its systems. A videotape taken by a passenger reveals that Chang had allowed Thomas to take the plane's controls at the time of the accident. A pilot more familiar with the aircraft would have known to allow the autopilot to correct for slats deployment, but Thomas's inexperience caused him to panic and assume manual control. Transpacific attempted to cover this up by changing his position on the crew list from first officer (a pilot with authorization to fly the plane) to flight engineer (a mechanic in charge of the aircraft systems). Chang ‚Äì who had been knocked unconscious during the accident and later died in the hospital ‚Äì was disguised as a first officer so that no one would realize he was outside the cockpit when the accident occurred. Despite her initial excitement at exonerating Norton, Casey realizes that she cannot publicize this information. Publicly pinning the blame for the accident on a TransPacific employee would sour relations with the airline, ruining future sales just as surely as any N-22 safety issues would. As Casey investigates further, she discovers a deeper plan at work. Richman had secretly plotted with another Norton executive, John Marder, to oust CEO Harold Edgarton from his position and seize control of the company. They intended to wait for an incident that would put the N-22's reputation in question and torpedo the company's deal with China. Then, once in control of Norton, they would finalize an even larger deal with a South Korean airline. The deal, already prepared, would initially be worth several billion dollars, leading to huge profits for current stockholders, but would eventually destroy the company by moving production of the wing overseas, giving critical know-how away to competitors. Casey manages to thwart the plan by revealing the truth to TV producer Jennifer Malone, who had promised to run a devastating report on the N-22's safety issues. Once Malone is shown the evidence, she cannot claim ignorance of the truth and air her report anyway without opening herself up to a defamation lawsuit. She is also unable to report the true story, since her boss doesn't think it's exciting enough to hold people's attention. With the N-22's reputation cleared, the China deal goes off without a hitch, and the company's future is secured. Afterwards, Edgarton promotes Casey to head the company's Media Relations Division. Richman is later arrested in Singapore for narcotics possession, while Marder leaves the company, supposedly on good terms.

Major themes Air safety procedures are a central theme in the novel. In illustrating the redundancies and safety measures necessary for every step of the airplane construction process as well as condemning the death of other publicly maligned aircraft such as the DC-10, Crichton challenges public perception of air safety, highlighting how the blame for accidents is often directed at the wrong party. Another central theme, which compounds the issue mentioned above, is investigative journalism, and the consequences when sensational media agencies distort the truth to produce a better-selling story. The TV journalism subplot was singled out for praise in some reviews; Entertainment Weekly lauded it as \\"brutal and fresh and very funny\\" satire. The San Francisco Chronicle calls his portrayal of TV journalists believable, noting that Crichton \\"doesn't mind making enemies.\\" Airframe also continues the theme of human failure in human-machine interaction that is present across Crichton's other works. Despite malfunctions due to improper maintenance, the plane itself was functional; the incident was a result of human error by an insufficiently trained pilot. References to real events In Airframe, as in most of his novels, Crichton uses the literary device of false documents, presenting numerous technical documents to create a sense of authenticity. He also takes great pains to be as accurate as possible in the novel's technical details. When the characters discuss how unfavorable media coverage can be the undoing of a perfectly good aircraft, his account of the American Airlines Flight 191 crash and its causes are consistent with the known facts at the time the novel was written. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Crichton said that he drew upon the National Transportation Safety Board's aircraft accident report archives during his writing process, calling them \\"an unbelievable trove.\\" As a result, the N-22 accident described in the novel resembles two real-life cases: *The violent oscillations, the issue with the flap/slat handle becoming dislodged, and the importance of pilot training in order to respond properly to the characteristics of a specific aircraft type are closely modeled on the 1993 accident aboard China Eastern Airlines Flight 583. * A pilot allowing his son to sit at the controls was also the cause of the 1994 Aeroflot Flight 593 crash. As in the novel, the son inadvertently disabled their aircraft's autopilot, and the accident could have been averted by re-engaging it. However, while the son in Airframe is a pilot, the son in this case was only 16 years old. Also unlike the novel, the Aeroflot crew did not manage to recover from their overcorrection and crashed, killing all 75 passengers and crew. Reception Airframe received generally positive reviews. In her San Francisco Chronicle review, Patricia Holt called it \\"classic Crichton,\\" adding that readers will be \\"surprised, satisfied and even a bit better informed at the end.\\" The New York Times' Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said of the novel, \\"By playing hide and seek with his plot, Mr. Crichton writes as if he were an engineer and his readers were all outsiders. Yet at the same time, he has taken on a complex subject in Airframe and made its subtleties dramatically vivid.\\"Lehmann-Haupt, Christopher. \\"A thriller not to carry on your next plane trip\\". The New York Times, December 5, 1996. Tom De Haven of Entertainment Weekly praised Crichton's research, saying, \\"I bet Michael Crichton was a kid who did his homework every night ‚Äî and not only did it, but triple-checked it, made sure there were no smudges on the paper, then presented it to the teacher between card-stock covers secured with shiny brass fasteners.\\" The Boston Globe's Nancy Harris commended Crichton on his ability to simplify the technical intricacies of aviation, calling Airframe a \\"very readable book.\\" Reviews tempered their praise with criticism of Crichton's writing style. De Haven took issue with the novel's use of genre clich√©s and \\"the clunkiest of plot gimmicks.\\" Holt called it \\"formulaic but hard to put down\\" and described its characters as \\"cardboard.\\" Lehmann-Haupt went even further, saying, \\"When you finish the novel and ask yourself why you end up feeling both entertained and frustrated, you are forced to reflect that a writer clever enough to bring such material to life ought to have been able to tell his story without playing manipulative games with the reader.\\" Though the central accident in Airframe primarily resembles China Eastern Airlines Flight 583 and Aeroflot Flight 593, Mark Lawson of The Guardian accused Crichton and his publishers of trying to capitalize on a different airplane disaster. Lawson notes that the novel was \\"loaded into airport bookstores shortly after the TWA 800 flight went down in the Atlantic,\\" adding, \\"Crichton's profile as a writer depends on ... extreme topicality.\\"  See also  * Accident analysis * List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft * Flight test * Failure analysis * Air route authority between the United States and China * Product liability References External links * Airframe webpage 1996 American novels Novels by Michael Crichton Techno-thriller novels Alfred A.

He is best remembered for creating and writing the old time radio programs Lights Out (1934-1947) and Quiet, Please (1947-1949) Biography Born Willis Oswald Cooper in Pekin, Illinois, he attended Pekin High School, graduating in 1916. He soon joined the U.S. Cavalry where, achieving the rank of Sergeant, he spent time on the Mexican border. In 1917, he became a part of the Signal Corps and was sent to France during World War I. While in France he was gassed at the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He remained on active duty until 1919 when he left to become an advertising writer, though he maintained his reserve status. By the late 1920s he was writing advertising copy in Chicago and entered radio, writing scripts for the 1929-1931 NBC radio program Empire Builders. He later worked as continuity editor of CBS Chicago and, in 1933, left to take the same position at NBC Chicago. In 1934, he created his best known dramatic series, a late night horror radio program called Lights Out, which he also directed. Airing at midnight, the program quickly earned a reputation for its gory deaths and sound effects. The show would prove to be a long-term success, but in 1936, Cooper capitalized on the fame of Lights Out and resigned from NBC, moving to Hollywood, California, where he worked as a screenwriter for various film studios. He wrote the screenplay for the 1939 film Son of Frankenstein (which introduced the character of \\"Ygor\\") and contributed to a few of the Mr. Moto films. At the same time, he continued to provide radio scripts for various series including Hollywood Hotel. Arch Oboler, who took over the writing of Lights Out when Cooper left, would suggest that Cooper was the first person to create a unique form of radio drama, writing, \\"Radio drama (as distinguished from theatre plays boiled down to kilocycle size) began at midnight, in the middle thirties, on one of the upper NBC floors of Chicago's Merchandise Mart. The pappy was a rotund writer by the name of Willys (sic) Cooper.\\" By 1940, Cooper moved to New York City, where he changed his name from ‚ÄúWillis‚Äù to ‚ÄúWyllis‚Äù in order \\"to please his wife's numerological inclinations\\". He continued to make his living writing radio scripts for various network programs including The Campbell Playhouse, the sponsored successor of Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre. During World War II, he was made a consultant to the Secretary of War and produced, directed and wrote The Army Hour, a weekly news and variety propaganda series. In 1944, Cooper joined the radio department of New York's Compton Advertising, Inc. In 1947, he created what was arguably his finest radio effort, Quiet, Please, which began over the Mutual Broadcasting System network but which later moved to ABC. He also wrote and directed a crime anthology for NBC called Whitehall 1212 that debuted on November 18, 1951. Hosted by Chief Superintendent John Davidson, fictional curator of the Black Museum at Scotland Yard, it featured an allegedly all-British cast and told stories inspired by artifacts held by the famous London crime museum. Cooper's show competed with a similar program (hosted by Orson Welles), which ran on Mutual in 1952. As television became the dominant entertainment medium, Cooper experimented with various programs including a series he wrote and produced called Volume One.

He was the husband of international film star Sophia Loren. Career Ponti was born in Magenta, Lombardy, where his grandfather had been mayor of the city. Ponti studied law at the University of Milan. He joined his father's law firm in Milan and became involved in the film business through negotiating contracts. Ponti attempted to establish a film industry in Milan in 1940 and produced Mario Soldati's Piccolo Mondo Antico there, starring Alida Valli, in her first notable role. The film dealt with the Italian struggle against the Austrians for the inclusion of northeastern Italy into the Kingdom of Italy during the Risorgimento. The film was successful, because it was easy to see \\"the Austrians as Germans\\" during World War II. As a result, he was briefly jailed for undermining relations with Nazi Germany. Ponti accepted an offer from Riccardo Gualino's Lux Film in Rome in 1941, where he produced a series of commercially successful films featuring the comedian Tot√≤. In 1954 he had his greatest artistic success with the production of Federico Fellini's La strada. However, Fellini denied Ponti's role in its success and said that \\"La Strada was made in spite of Ponti and De Laurentiis\\". Ponti produced Boccaccio '70 in 1962, Marriage Italian Style in 1964, and Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow in 1965. He produced his most popular and financially successful film, Doctor Zhivago, in 1965; the movie was directed by David Lean. He subsequently produced three notable films with Michelangelo Antonioni, Blowup in 1966, Zabriskie Point in 1970 and The Passenger in 1974. Personal life =Marriages= In 1946, he married Giuliana Fiastri with whom he had a daughter, Guendalina, in 1951, and a son, Alex, in 1953. While serving as a judge in a beauty contest in 1951, Ponti met a minor actress named Sofia Lazzaro (real name Sofia Villani Scicolone). He subsequently cast her in films such as Anna (1951). In 1952, his friend Goffredo Lombardo, head of production at Titanus, changed Lazzaro's name to Sophia Loren. Five years later, Ponti obtained a Mexican divorce from his first wife and married Sophia Loren by proxy. Divorce was still forbidden in Italy, and he was informed that were he to return there, he would be charged with bigamy, and Loren would be charged with \\"concubinage\\". Ponti co-produced several films in Hollywood starring Loren, establishing her fame, although most were box-office failures. In 1960, he and Loren returned to Italy and when summoned to court, denied being married. In 1962, they had the marriage annulled, after which Ponti arranged with his first wife, Giuliana, that the three of them move to France (which at that time allowed divorce) and become French citizens. In 1965, Giuliana Ponti divorced her husband, allowing Ponti to marry Loren in 1966 in a civil wedding in S√®vres. They later became French citizens after their application was approved by then-French President Georges Pompidou. Ponti and Loren had two children: * Carlo Ponti Jr. (born 29 December 1968) * Edoardo Ponti (born 6 January 1973) Their daughters-in-law are Sasha Alexander and Andrea Meszaros. They have four grandchildren. Loren remained married to Ponti until his death on 10 January 2007 of pulmonary complications. =Kidnapping attempts= Two unsuccessful attempts were made to kidnap Ponti in 1975, including one involving an attack on his car with gunfire. =Smuggling charges= He was tried in absentia in 1979 for smuggling money and works of art abroad, fined 22 billion lire, and sentenced to four years in prison. Ponti did not attend the hearing, as his French nationality made him immune from extradition. He was finally cleared of the charges in 1990. Art collection Ponti owned works by, among others, Picasso, Georges Braque, Renoir, Ren√© Magritte (including his Lumi√®re du pole from 1927), Salvador Dal√≠, Henry Moore (including his Figure from 1933), Barbara Hepworth, Giorgio de Chirico and Canaletto. His collection was renowned for containing ten works by Francis Bacon. These included examples from his early Van Gogh series, triptychs, self-portraits and pope paintings, which were rarely publicised or lent to public exhibitions. In 1977 the Bacon paintings, then valued at an estimated $6.7 million, were seized and turned over by the Italian government to the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan; thirty-three sketches by George Grosz went to a museum in Caserta.Sam Kashner (March 2012), Sophia‚Äôs Choices Vanity Fair. When Ponti reached a deal with the Italian government and was cleared of the charges brought against him in 1990, he regained possession of 230 confiscated paintings.Nancy Collins (January 1991), Sophia Vanity Fair. At some point, the collection is said to have been split between Ponti and Loren.Colin Gleadell (January 30, 2007), Art sales: Sophia Loren's slice of Bacon The Daily Telegraph. Over the years, several works have been sold privately. In 2006 two Bacon paintings that had previously been in the Ponti collection were exhibited in an exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London. One, a vertical composition of four self-portraits, had already been sold to the American collector Steven A. Cohen. In 2007 another pope painting by Bacon, sold by Ponti in 1991, was sold in a private deal brokered by Acquavella Galleries in New York for more than ¬£15 million.

Life and career Bernau was born in Santa Barbara, California to Herbert Bernau, a physiotherapist, and Emma Bernau (nee Vercellino), a homemaker. Bernau showed a love for the theatre at an early age, and was frequently cast in high school plays. Bernau trained in the drama department at the University of California before getting his big break, appearing in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of Antony and Cleopatra in 1962. He continued in that role until 1964, when he toured nationally in the production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? These roles, in addition to performing at Canada's Stratford Festival, led to an appearance in a brief story arc on Dark Shadows in 1969 and 1970, where he portrayed Philip Todd. His most famous role, however, was that of villain Alan Spaulding on the soap opera Guiding Light, a role he played from 1977 to 1984 and again from 1986 until 1988. He left the show due to illness shortly before his death in 1989. Though his famous character was portrayed as a habitual womanizer, Bernau is considered to be one of the only truly \\"out\\" soap opera actors, as it was fairly well known by both the actors he worked with and the soap press at large that he was gay. Death Bernau was diagnosed with AIDS but continued to work on Guiding Light. He left the show in the summer of 1988, when he became too ill to show up at work, with his role being assumed by actor Daniel Pilon, until his role could be recast with a suitable permanent actor. Bernau died of a heart attack brought on by complications from AIDS on June 14, 1989 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West) in New York City at the age of 49. At first, Bernau's AIDS diagnosis was kept private, with his death certificate listing 'natural causes' as the cause of his death. He is buried at Santa Barbara Cemetery, Santa Barbara, California.

The world's first partial face transplant on a living human was carried out in France in 2005. The world's first full face transplant was completed in Spain in 2010. Turkey, France, the United States and Spain (in order of total number of successful face transplants performed) are considered the leading countries in the research into the procedure. Beneficiaries of face transplant People with faces disfigured by trauma, burns, disease, or birth defects might aesthetically benefit from the procedure. Professor Peter Butler at the Royal Free Hospital first suggested this approach in treating people with facial disfigurement in a Lancet article in 2002.Face transplantation‚Äîfantasy or the future? Lancet 360:5‚Äì6; 2002. This suggestion caused considerable debate at the time concerning the ethics of this procedure. An alternative to a face transplant is facial reconstruction, which typically involves moving the patient's own skin from their back, buttocks, thighs, or chest to their face in a series of as many as 50 operations to regain even limited functionality, and a face that is often likened to a mask or a living quilt. History = Self as donor (\\"face replant\\")= The world's first full-face replant operation was on 9-year-old Sandeep Kaur, whose face was ripped off when her hair was caught in a thresher. Sandeep's mother witnessed the accident. Sandeep arrived at the hospital unconscious with her face in two pieces in a plastic bag. An article in The Guardian recounts: \\"In 1994, a nine-year-old child in northern India lost her face and scalp in a threshing machine accident. Her parents raced to the hospital with her face in a plastic bag and a surgeon managed to reconnect the arteries and replant the skin.\\" The operation was successful, although the child was left with some muscle damage as well as scarring around the perimeter where the facial skin was sutured back on. Sandeep's doctor was Abraham Thomas, one of India's top microsurgeons. In 2004, Sandeep was training to be a nurse. In 1996, a similar operation was performed in the Australian state of Victoria, when a woman's face and scalp, torn off in a similar accident, was packed in ice and successfully reattached. =Partial face transplant=  France The world's first partial face transplant on a living human was carried out on 27 November 2005 by Bernard Devauchelle, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Benoit Lengel√©, a Belgian plastic surgeon, and Jean-Michel Dubernard in Amiens, France. Isabelle Dinoire underwent surgery to replace her original face, which had been mauled by her dog. A triangle of face tissue from a brain-dead woman's nose and mouth was grafted onto the patient. On 13 December 2007, the first detailed report of the progress of this transplant after 18 months was released in the New England Journal of Medicine and documents that the patient was happy with the results but also that the journey has been very difficult, especially with respect to her immune system's response.Outcomes 18 Months after the First Human Partial Face Transplantation, New England Journal of Medicine, 13 December 2007Face- Transplant Patient 'Satisfied': Some Who Criticized Procedure Are Impressed With Results, By Rick Weiss, Washington Post, Thursday, 13 December 2007; Page A22 Dinoire died on April 22, 2016 at the age of 49 following cancer from medications.http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/06/health/france-face-transplant- patient-dies/index.html A 29-year-old French man underwent surgery in 2007. He had a facial tumor called a neurofibroma caused by a genetic disorder. The tumor was so massive that the man could not eat or speak properly. In March 2008, the treatment of 30-year-old Pascal Coler of France, who has neurofibromatosis, ended after he received what his doctors call the world's first successful almost full face transplant. The operation, which lasted approximately 20 hours, was designed and performed by Laurent Lantieri and his team (Jean-Paul Meningaud, Antonios Paraskevas and Fabio Ingallina).  China In April 2006, Dr Guo Shuzhong at the Xijing military hospital in Xi'an, China, similarly transplanted the cheek, upper lip, and nose of Li Guoxing, who was mauled by an Asiatic black bear while protecting his sheep. On 21 December 2008, it was reported that Li had died in July in his home village in Yunnan. Prior to his death, a documentary on the Discovery Channel showed he had stopped taking immuno-suppressant drugs in favour of herbal medication; a decision that was likely a contributing factor to his death, according to his surgeon.Chinas first face transplant recipient dies  Turkey Selahattin √ñzmen performed a partial face transplant on 17 March 2012 on Hatice Nergis, a twenty-year-old woman at Gazi University's hospital in Ankara. It was Turkey's third, the first woman-to-woman and the first three-dimensional with bone tissue. The patient from Kahramanmara≈ü had lost her upper jaw six years prior in a firearm accident, including her mouth, lips, palate, teeth and nasal cavity, and was since then unable to eat. She had undergone around 35 reconstructive plastic surgery operations. The donor was a 28-year-old Turkish woman of Moldavian origin in Istanbul, who had died by suicide. Nergis died in Ankara on 15 November 2016 after she was hospitalized two days prior due to strong pains.  Belgium In December 2011, a 54-year-old man underwent a partial face transplant to the lower two thirds of the face (including bone) after a ballistic trauma. The operation was performed by a multidisciplinary team led by plastic surgeon Phillip Blondeel; Hubert Vermeersch, Nathalie Roche and Filip Stillaert were other members of the surgical team. For the first time 3D CT planning was used to plan the operation that lasted 20 hours. The patient is alive, functional doing well and has a full reintegrated life in society.  Italy  In September 2018, a 49-year old woman affected by Neurofibromatosis type I received a partial face transplant from a 21-year old girl at Sant‚ÄôAndrea Hospital of Sapienza University in Rome. The procedure took 27 hours and was carried out by two teams led by Fabio Santanelli di Pompeo and Benedetto Longo. Unfortunately, the patient had a complication and after two days the surgeons had to replace the facial graft with autologous tissue. The patient is still alive and waiting for a second face transplantation.  Canada  In May 2018, the first Canadian complete face transplant was performed under the leadership of plastic surgeon Daniel Borsuk at the Hopital Maisonneuve Rosemont, in Montreal, Quebec. The transplant took over 30 hours and replaced the upper and lower jaws, nose, lips and teeth on Maurice Desjardins, a 64-year-old man that shot himself in a hunting accident. At that time, Mr. Desjardins was the oldest person to benefit from a face transplant. =Full face transplant= On 20 March 2010, a team of 30 Spanish doctors carried out the first full face transplant, on a man injured in a shooting accident. It became the first full face transplant in the world. On 8 July 2010, the French media reported that a full face transplant, including tear ducts and eyelids, was carried out at the Henri-Mondor hospital in Cr√©teil. In March 2011, a surgical team, led by Bohdan Pomahaƒç at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, performed a full face transplant on Dallas Wiens who was badly disfigured in a power line accident that left him blind and without lips, nose or eyebrows. The patient's sight couldn't be recovered but he has been able to talk on the phone and smell. In April 2011, less than one month after the hospital performed the first full face transplant in the country, the Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital face transplant team, led by Bohdan Pomahaƒç, performed the nation's second full face transplant on patient Mitch Hunter of Speedway, Indiana. It was the third face transplant procedure to be performed at BWH and the fourth face transplant in the country. The team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, anesthesiologists and residents worked for more than 14 hours to replace the full facial area of patient Mitch Hunter, 30, of Indiana, including the nose, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power them and provide sensation. Hunter suffered a severe shock from a high voltage electrical wire following a car accident in 2001. Poland On 15 May 2013, at the Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology branch in Gliwice, Poland, an entire face was transplanted onto a male patient, Grzegorz (aged 33) after he lost the front of his head in a machine accident at work. The surgery took 27 hours and was directed by Professor Adam Maciejewski. There had not been much planning or prep time before the surgery, which was performed about one month after the accident, because the transplantation was done as an urgent life-saving surgery due to the patient's difficulty in eating and breathing. Shortly after the donor's death, the decision to perform the surgery was made and his body was transported hundreds of kilometers to Gliwice once his relatives gave their consent. The doctors believe that their patient has an excellent chance to live a normal, active life after surgery, and that his face should operate more or less normally (his eyes survived the accident untouched). Seven months later, on 4 December, the same Polish medical team in Gliwice transplanted a face onto 26-year-old female patient with neurofibromatosis. Two months after the operation, she left the hospital.  Turkey On 21 January 2012, Turkish surgeon √ñmer √ñzkan and his team successfully performed a full face transplant at Akdeniz University's hospital in Antalya. The 19-year-old patient, Uƒüur Acar, was badly burnt in a house fire when he was a baby. The donor was 39-year-old Ahmet Kaya, who died on 20 January. The Turkish doctors declared that his body had accepted the new tissue. Almost one month later on 24 February 2012, a surgical team led by Serdar Nasƒ±r conducted the country's second successful full face transplant at Hacettepe University's hospital in Ankara on 25-year-old Cengiz G√ºl. The patient's face was badly burned in a television tube implosion accident when he was two years old. The donor was 40-year-old N. A. (his family did not permit the identity of the donor to be revealed), who experienced brain death two days before the surgery following a motorcycle accident that occurred on 17 February. On 16 May 2012, surgeon √ñmer √ñzkan and his team at the Akdeniz University Hospital performed the country's fourth and their second full face transplant. The face and ears of 27-year-old patient Turan √áolak from Izmir were burnt when he fell into an oven when he was three and half years old. The donor was Tevfik Yƒ±lmaz, a 19-year-old man from U≈üak who had attempted suicide on 8 May. He was declared brain dead in the evening hours of 15 May after having been in intensive care for seven days. His parents donated all his organs. On 18 July 2013, the face of a Polish man was successfully given to a Turkish man in a transplant performed by √ñzkan, at Akdeniz University hospital following a 6.5-hour operation, making it the fifth such operation to take place in the country. It was the 25th face transplant operation in the world. The donor was Andrzej Kucza, a 42-year-old Polish tourist who was declared brain dead following a heart attack on July 14 while swimming in Turkey's sea resort Muƒüla. The 27-year-old patient Recep Sert came immediately from Bursa to Antalya for the surgery in late July 2017. On 23 August 2013, surgeon √ñmer √ñzkan and his team at Akdeniz University performed the sixth face transplant surgery in Turkey. Salih √úst√ºn (54) received the scalp, eyelids, jaw and maxilla, nose and the half tongue of 31-year-old Muhittin Turan, who was declared brain dead after a motorcycle accident that took place two days before. On 30 December 2013, √ñzkan and his team conducted their fifth and Turkey's seventh face transplant surgery at the hospital of Akdeniz University. The nose, upper lip, upper jaw and maxilla of brain dead Ali Emre K√º√ß√ºk, aged 34, were successfully transplanted to 22-year-old Recep Kaya, whose face was badly deformed in a shotgun accident. While Kaya was flown from Kƒ±rklareli to Antalya via Istanbul in four hours, the donor's organs were transported from Edirne by an ambulance airplane. The surgery took 4 hours and 10 minutes. United Kingdom In October 2006, surgeon Peter Butler at London's Royal Free Hospital in the UK was given permission by the NHS ethics board to carry out face transplants. His team will select four adult patients (children cannot be selected due to concerns over consent), with operations being carried out at six-month intervals. United States In 2004, the Cleveland Clinic became the first institution to approve this surgery and test it on cadavers. In 2005, the Cleveland Clinic became the first US hospital to approve the procedure. In December 2008, a team at the Cleveland Clinic, led by Maria Siemionow and including a group of supporting doctors and six plastic surgeons (Steven Bernard, Dr Mark Hendrickson, Robert Lohman, Dan Alam and Francis Papay) performed the first face transplant in the US on a woman named Connie Culp. It was the world's first near-total facial transplant and the fourth known facial transplant to have been successfully performed to date. This operation was the first facial transplant known to have included bones, along with muscle, skin, blood vessels, and nerves. The woman received a nose, most of the sinuses around the nose, the upper jaw, and even some teeth from a brain-dead donor. As doctors recovered the donor's facial tissue, they paid special attention to maintaining arteries, veins, and nerves, as well as soft tissue and bony structures. The surgeons then connected facial graft vessels to the patient's blood vessels in order to restore blood circulation in the reconstructed face before connecting arteries, veins and nerves in the 22-hour procedure. She had been disfigured to the point where she could not eat or breathe on her own as a result of a traumatic injury several years ago, which had left her without a nose, right eye and upper jaw. Doctors hoped the operation would allow her to regain her sense of smell and ability to smile, and said she had a \\"clear understanding\\" of the risks involved. Face transplant recipient Jim Maki (left) with Bohdan Pomahaƒç The second partial face transplant in the US took place at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston on 9 April 2009. During a 17-hour operation, a surgical team led by MUDr. Bohdan Pomahaƒç, replaced the nose, upper lip, cheeks, and roof of the mouth ‚Äì along with corresponding muscles, bones and nerves ‚Äì of James Maki, age 59. Maki's face was severely injured after falling onto the electrified third rail at a Boston subway station in 2005. In May 2009, he made a public media appearance and declared he was happy with the result.usatoday article Face transplant recipient 'happy' with results This procedure was also shown in the eighth episode of the ABC documentary series Boston Med. The first full face transplant performed in the US was done on a construction worker named Dallas Wiens in March 2011. He was burned in an electrical accident in 2008. This operation, performed by Bohdan Pomahaƒç and BWH plastic surgery team, was paid for with the help of the US defense department. They hope to learn from this procedure and use what they learn to help soldiers suffering from facial injuries.Fayetteville Observer article Full-face transplant a first in U.S.; military helps pay for operation One of the top benefits of the surgery was that Dallas has regained his sense of smell. The Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital transplant team led by Dr. Bohdan Pomahaƒç, performed the nation's second full face transplant on patient Mitch Hunter of Speedway, Indiana. He was left disfigured in a car accident, burning about 94% of his face. It was the third face transplant procedure to be performed at BWH and the fourth face transplant in the country. The team of more than 30 physicians, nurses, anesthesiologists and residents worked for more than 14 hours to replace the full facial area of patient Mitch Hunter including the nose, eyelids, muscles of facial animation and the nerves that power them and provide sensation. Mitch Hunter was a passenger in a single cab pick-up truck, upon exiting the vehicle and pulling another passenger off a downed line, Hunter was then struck by a 10,000-volt 7-amp power line for a little under five minutes. The electricity entered his lower left leg, with the majority exiting his face, leaving him severely disfigured. He also lost part of his lower left leg, below the knee, and lost two digits on his right hand (pinkie and ring finger). Hunter has regained almost 100% of his normal sensation back in his face and his only complaint is that he looks too much like his older brother. 57-year-old Charla Nash, who was mauled by a chimpanzee named Travis in 2009, after the owner gave the chimp xanax and wine. She underwent a 20-hour full face transplant in May 2011 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Nash's full face transplant was the third surgery of its kind performed in the United States, all at the same hospital. In March 2012, a face transplant was completed at the University of Maryland Medical Center and R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center under the leadership of plastic surgeon Eduardo Rodriguez and his team (Amir Dorafshar, Michael Christy, Branko Bojovic and Daniel Borsuk MD). The recipient was 37-year-old Richard Norris, who had suffered a facial gunshot injury in 1997. He was drunk that night, and told his mom and dad he was going to kill himself. But he didn‚Äôt know the gun was loaded. This transplant included all facial and anterior neck skin, both jaws, and the tongue. In August 2015, a face transplant was completed at the NYU Langone Medical Center under the leadership of the chair of plastic surgery Eduardo D. Rodriguez and his team. A 41 year old retired fireman named Patrick Hardison received the face of cyclist David Rodebaugh. In June 2016, a multidisciplinary team of surgeons, physicians and other health professionals completed a near-total face transplant at Mayo Clinic‚Äôs Rochester campus. Patient Andrew Sandness, a 32-year-old from eastern Wyoming, had devastating facial injuries from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2006. The surgery, which spanned more than 50 hours, restored Sandness‚Äô nose, upper and lower jaw, palate, teeth, cheeks, facial muscles, oral mucosa, some of the salivary glands and the skin of his face (from below the eyelids to the neck and from ear to ear). The care team lead by Samir Mardini, and Hatem Amer, the surgical director and medical director, respectively, for the Mayo Clinic Essam and Dalal Obaid Center for Reconstructive Transplant Surgery, devoted more than 50 Saturdays over 3¬Ω years to rehearsing the surgery, using sets of cadaver heads to transplant the face of one to the other. They used 3-D imaging and virtual surgery to plot out the bony cuts so the donor's face would fit perfectly on the transplant recipient. Today, in addition to his physical transformation, Sandness can smell again, breathe normally and eat foods that were off-limits for a decade. In a 31-hour operation starting on May 4, 2017, surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic transplanted a face donated from Adrea Schneider, who had died of a drug overdose, to Katie Stubblefield, whose face had been disfigured in a suicide attempt by rifle on March 25, 2014. , Katie is the youngest person in the United States to have had a face transplant, age 21 at the time. Surgeons originally planned to leave her cheeks, eyebrows, eyelids, most of her forehead, and the sides of her face alone. However, because the donor face was larger and darker than Katie's, they made the decision to transplant the donor's full face. This holds the risk that in case of acute rejection in which the face must be removed, she would not have enough tissue for reconstructive surgery. Katie was featured on the cover of National Geographic in September 2018 for an article entitled \\"The Story of a Face.\\" See also: Ethics, surgery and post-operation treatment The procedure consists of a series of operations requiring rotating teams of specialists. With issues of tissue type, age, sex, and skin color taken into consideration, the patient's face is removed and replaced (sometimes including the underlying fat, nerves, blood vessels, bones, and/or musculature). The surgery may last anywhere from 8 to 36 hours, followed by a 10- to 14-day hospital stay. There has been a substantial amount of ethical debate surrounding the operation and its performance. The main issue is that, as noted below, the procedure entails submitting otherwise physically healthy people to potentially fatal, lifelong immunosuppressant therapy. So far, four people have died of complications related to the procedure. Citing the comments of various plastic surgeons and medical professionals from France and Mexico, anthropologist Samuel Taylor- Alexander suggests that the operation has been infused with nationalist import, which is ultimately influencing the decision-making and ethical judgements of the involved parties. His most recent research suggests the face transplant community needs to do more in order to ensure that the experiential knowledge of face transplant recipients is included in the ongoing evaluation of the field.Taylor-Alexander, Samuel. On Face Transplantation: Like and Ethics in Experimental Biomedicine. London: Palgrave Macmillan After the procedure, a lifelong regimen of immunosuppressive drugs is necessary to suppress the patient's own immune systems and prevent rejection. Long-term immunosuppression increases the risk of developing life-threatening infections, kidney damage, and cancer. The surgery may result in complications such as infections that could damage the transplanted face and require a second transplant or reconstruction with skin grafts.

Discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell on 28 November 1967, it is the first discovered radio pulsar. The power and regularity of the signals were briefly thought to resemble an extraterrestrial beacon, leading the source to be nicknamed LGM-1 (for \\"little green men\\"). The original designation of this pulsar was CP 1919, which stands for Cambridge Pulsar at RA . It is also known as PSR J1921+2153 and is located in the constellation of Vulpecula.  Discovery  In 1967, a radio signal was detected using the Interplanetary Scintillation Array of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, UK, by Jocelyn Bell Burnell. The signal had a -second period and 0.04-second pulsewidth. It originated at celestial coordinates right ascension, +21¬∞ declination. It was detected by individual observation of miles of graphical data traces. Due to its almost perfect regularity, it was at first assumed to be spurious noise, but this hypothesis was promptly discarded. The discoverers jokingly named it little green men 1 (LGM-1), considering that it may have originated from an extraterrestrial civilization, but Bell Burnell soon ruled out extraterrestrial life as a source after discovering a similar signal from another part of the sky. The original signal turned out to be radio emissions from the pulsar CP 1919, and was the first one recognized as such. Bell Burnell noted that other scientists could have discovered pulsars before her, but their observations were either ignored or disregarded. Researchers Thomas Gold and Sir Fred Hoyle identified this astronomical object as a rapidly rotating neutron star immediately upon their announcement. Before the nature of the signal was determined, the researchers, Bell Burnell and her PhD supervisor Antony Hewish, considered the possibility of extraterrestrial life: (after-dinner speech given at the Eighth Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics; first published in ) > We did not really believe that we had picked up signals from another > civilization, but obviously the idea had crossed our minds and we had no > proof that it was an entirely natural radio emission. It is an interesting > problem ‚Äì if one thinks one may have detected life elsewhere in the > universe[,] how does one announce the results responsibly? Who does one tell > first?  Nobel Prize controversy  When Hewish and Martin Ryle received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1974 for their work in radio astronomy and pulsars, Hoyle argued that Jocelyn Bell Burnell should have been a co-recipient of the prize.

William was the son of Thomas Cleland, gamekeeper to the Marquess of Douglas, chief of the House of Douglas. He was probably brought up on the Douglas estate, centred at Douglas Castle, Lanarkshire, and was educated at St Andrew's University. Immediately on leaving college he joined the army of the Covenanters, and was present at the Battle of Drumclog, where, says Robert Wodrow, some attributed to Cleland the manoeuvre which led to the victory. He also fought at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. He and his brother James were described in a royal proclamation of 16 June 1679, among the leaders of the insurgents. He escaped to Holland, but in 1685 was again in Scotland in connection with the abortive invasion led by Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll. He escaped once more, to return in 1688 as agent for William III of England (William of Orange). He was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the Cameronian regiment raised from the Marquess' tenantry and a minority of the western Covenanters who consented to serve under William II. The Cameronians were entrusted with the defence of Dunkeld, which they held against the fierce assault of the Jacobites on 21 August at the Battle of Dunkeld where William Cleland was killed. His Major was wounded and the command fell to George Munro. The defeat of the Jacobites at Dunkeld ended the Jacobite rising, but Cleland fell in the struggle from gunshot wounds to the head and liver. His Collection of several Poems and Verses composed upon various occasions was published posthumously in 1697. Of Hullo, my fancie, whither wilt thou go? only the last nine stanzas are by Cleland. His poems have small literary merit, and are written, not in pure Lowland Scots, but in English. with a large admixture of Scottish words. The longest and most important of them are the mock poems On the Expedition of the Highland Host who came to destroy the western shires in winter 1678 and On the clergie when they met to consult about taking the Test in the year 1681.

In about 1760 he went on the stage in the provinces, and some three years later began to appear in minor parts at Covent Garden Theatre. His first role of importance was that of Young Marlow in She Stoops to Conquer, at its production of that comedy in 1773, when he delivered an epilogue specially written for him by Goldsmith. He remained a member of the Covent Garden company until 1783, appearing in many parts, among which were Fag in The Rivals, which he created, and Sir Anthony Absolute in the same comedy. In 1783 he removed to Drury Lane, where he assumed the Shakespearian r√¥les of Touchstone, Lucio, and Falstaff. In 1787 he left London for Edinburgh, where he gave recitations, including Cowper's \\"John Gilpin\\". For a short time in 1792 Lewes assisted Stephen Kemble in the management of the Dundee Repertory Theatre; in the following year he went to Dublin, but he was financially unsuccessful and suffered imprisonment for debt.

The event was founded in 1981 by Isadore Sharp, who had contacted Terry in hospital by telegram and expressed his wishes to hold an annual run in Terry's name to raise funds for cancer research. Sharp had lost his son to cancer in 1979. The event is held every year on the second Sunday following Labour Day. Since its inception, it has raised via the 'Terry Fox Foundation' over $750 million (CAD). The run is informal which means that the distance often varies, usually between 5 and 15 kilometres; participation is considered to be more important than completing the set distance. There are also runs set up by schools of every level, often with shorter distances than the \\"official\\" ones. The Terry Fox Run has no corporate sponsorship, in accordance with Terry Fox's original wishes of not seeking fame or fortune from his endeavour. During his cross-Canada run, he rejected every endorsement he was offered (including from multinational corporations such as McDonald's), as he felt that it would detract from his goal of creating public awareness. The Terry Fox Runs have no advertisements on any race related materials (such as T-shirts, banners, etc.). History Terry Fox The Terry Fox Foundation was founded in 1988 after it separated from the Canadian Cancer Society. Since its inception, The Terry Fox Foundation has raised over $750 million for cancer research. Currently, Terry Fox Runs take place every year with many participants from all over the world. The Run is a volunteer led, all-inclusive, non-competitive event with no corporate sponsorship, incentives or fundraising minimums. Fox laid out these wishes before his death in 1981. In 2007 The Terry Fox Foundation created the Terry Fox Research Institute to conduct translational research to significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, The Terry Fox Foundation directed $27.7 million to its cancer research programs. The Terry Fox Foundation has expanded beyond the traditional Run as well, by holding various other events. These events include National School Run Day, where schools throughout Canada hold a Run to commemorate Fox and raise funds, and The Great Canadian Hair \\"Do\\", which is a fundraising event that can take place at any time of the year. Participants are able to make the event as creative as they want‚Äî shave their heads, dye their hair a wacky colour, include a manly leg wax, and recruit friends to shave their heads as well.

The \\"shield\\" has been painted on, supposedly to indicate an underlying carving \\"Westford Knight\\" is the name given to a pattern, variously interpreted as a carving or a natural feature, or a combination of both, located on a glacial boulder (also known as the Sinclair Rock) in Westford, Massachusetts in the United States. It is notable for being the subject of popular or pseudohistorical speculation on Pre- Columbian trans-oceanic contact. The pattern was first described as a possible Native American carving in 1873. The identification as a \\"medieval knight\\" dates to 1954. Early references The rock and carving is first mentioned in print in an 1873 addition of the \\"Gazetteer of Massachusetts\\" and was described as \\"There upon its face a rude figure, supposed to have been cut by some Indian Artist.\\"Gazetteer of Massachusetts, 1873 page 542 In an 1883 town history, the carving is described as \\"A broad ledge which crops out near the house of William Kitteredge has upon its surface grooves made by glaciers. Rude outlines of the human face have been traced upon it, and the figure is said to be the work of Indians.\\"Reverend Edwin R. Hodgman, History of the Town of Westford, Mass 1659‚Äì1883 (Lowell, Mass.: Westford Town History Association, 1883). The carving was subsequently interpreted not as a human figure but as a broken Norse Sword by William Goodwin in his book on the America's Stonehenge site.William B. Goodwin, The Ruins of Great Ireland in New England (Boston: Meador Publishing Company, 1946). Frank Glynn, president of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut, re-located the carving and following discussions with T. C. Lethbridge about Goodwin's theory, chalked in a full figure in 1954, resembling a medieval knight, with a sword and shield, and he is usually said to be the \\"discoverer of the Westford Knight.\\"For example, in Richard White, These Stones Bear Witness, page 93 (Anchor House, 2010). It was Lethbridge who suggested to Glynn that the sword was not of Viking origin, but was \\"a hand-and-a-half wheel pommel sword\\" common in 14th century North Britain.Richard White, pages 87-88. Contemporary interpretations Archaeologist Ken Feder has compared weathering on the stone with weathering on New England gravestones whose inscriptions have become indecipherable in the last twenty years, while \\"the Westford petroglyph, rather miraculously, appears to have improved through time, getting fresher every year with new elements appearing that previously had gone unnoticed. In truth, this simply isn‚Äôt possible. The new imagery on the Westford Knight stone either has been recently added or is entirely imaginary, and probably a bit of both.\\" He argues that the Indian petroglyph described in the 19th century probably existed as did the parallel glacial striations, and that later a metal row or awl was used to punch the partial shape of a sword into the rock, and that \\"The knight in all his regalia resides only in the imagination of Frank Glynn. Other images‚Äîfor example, a boat, which I could not discern on my visits‚Äîmay have been added later.\\" Feder, Kenneth L.. Archaeological Oddities . Rowman & Littlefield Publishers. Kindle Edition. The current interpretation by those who advocate that the feature on the rock is a human figure is that it commemorates a fallen member of the party of Henry Sinclair, a Scottish Earl from Orkney, whom some believe to have made a voyage to the New World in 1398, traveling to Nova Scotia and New England.Tim Wallace-Murphy, Marilyn Hopkins Templars in America: From the Crusades to the New World (Weiser Books, 2004) According to Raymond Ramsey in 1972, the shield carried by the knight in the image was found to support this belief, when \\"English heraldic experts consulted by Lethbridge definitely identified arms on the shield as belonging to the Sinclairs of Scotland\\".Raymond H. Ramsey, No Longer on the Map: Discovering Places That Never Were, pages 65-66 (New York: The Viking Press, 1972). It has been suggested that the knight is Sir James Gunn, a member of Clan Gunn and a Knight Templar who reportedly traveled with Sinclair.Steven Sora, The Lost Colony of The Templars: Verrazano's Secret Mission To America, page 161 (Destiny Books, 2004). The monument next to the \\"knight\\" commemorates this interpretation, stating as fact that Sinclair and his party traveled to present-day Massachusetts. The claim was mentioned in an Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology in 2010.Kenneth L. Feder, Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum, pages 270-271 (Greenwood, 2010). The local town historian of Westford has stated that there is evidence that the T-shaped inscription was made in the late 19th century. There are some historians who believe that the area around the rock has undergone erosion since the clearing of trees in the 18th century, and that during the time of the alleged voyage by Sinclair, the rock may have been in a hardwood forest covered by of earth. There are some historians who claim that the timing is inconsistent with documented history, as at the time of the alleged voyage (1398), the Order of the Knights Templar was not in existence, having been publicly disbanded ninety years earlier.

It is composed of four separate stories with themes of tolerance, diversity, and compromise: \\"The Sneetches\\", \\"The Zax\\", \\"Too Many Daves\\", and \\"What Was I Scared Of?\\". Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" In 2012 it was ranked number 63 among the \\"Top 100 Picture Books\\" in a survey published by School Library Journal ‚Äì the fifth of five Dr. Seuss books on the list. The first two stories in the book (\\"The Sneetches\\" and \\"The Zax\\") were later adapted, along with Green Eggs and Ham, into 1973's animated TV musical special Dr. Seuss on the Loose: The Sneetches, The Zax, Green Eggs and Ham with Hans Conried voicing the narrator and both Zaxes, and Paul Winchell and Bob Holt voicing the Sneetches and Sylvester McMonkey McBean respectively.  Stories  = The Sneetches = The first story in the collection tells of a group of yellow bird-like creatures called the Sneetches, some of whom have a green star on their bellies. At the beginning of the story, Sneetches with stars discriminate against and shun those without. An entrepreneur named Sylvester McMonkey McBean (calling himself the Fix-It-Up Chappie) appears and offers the Sneetches without stars the chance to get them with his Star-On machine, for three dollars. The treatment is instantly popular, but this upsets the original star-bellied Sneetches, as they are in danger of losing their special status. McBean then tells them about his Star-Off machine, costing ten dollars, and the Sneetches who originally had stars happily pay the money to have them removed in order to remain special. However, McBean does not share the prejudices of the Sneetches and allows the recently starred Sneetches through this machine as well. Ultimately this escalates, with the Sneetches running from one machine to the next... : \\"...until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew : whether this one was that one... or that one was this one... : or which one was what one... or what one was who.\\" This continues until the Sneetches are penniless and McBean departs as a rich man, amused by their folly. Despite his assertion that \\"you can't teach a Sneetch\\", the Sneetches learn from this experience that neither plain-belly nor star-belly Sneetches are superior, and they are able to get along and become friends. \\"The Sneetches\\" was intended by Seuss as a satire of discrimination between races and cultures, and was specifically inspired by his opposition to antisemitism. = The Zax = In The Zax, a North-going Zax and a South-going Zax meet face to face on the Prairie of Prax. Each asks the other to make way, but neither budges, saying it is against their upbringing to move any other way. Because they stubbornly refuse to move (east, west, or any direction except their respective headings) to get past each other, the two Zax then face off against each other with their arms crossed. The Zax stand so long that eventually a highway overpass is built around them. The story ends with the Zax still standing there \\"unbudged\\" in their tracks. = Too Many Daves = \\"Too Many Daves\\" is a very short story about a mother, Mrs. McCave, who named all 23 of her sons Dave. This causes minor problems in the family, and the majority of the story lists unusual and amusing names she wishes she had given them, such as \\"Bodkin Van Horn,\\" \\"Hoos Foos,\\" \\"Snimm,\\" \\"Hot-Shot,\\" \\"Shadrack,\\" \\"Stuffy,\\" \\"Stinky,\\" \\"Putt-Putt\\", \\"Buffalo Bill,\\" \\"Oliver Boliver Butt,\\" \\"Biffalo Buff,\\" or \\"Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate\\". The story ends with the statement that \\"she didn't do it, and now it's too late.\\" = What Was I Scared Of? = \\"What Was I Scared Of?\\" tells the tale of a character who frequently encounters an empty pair of pale-green pants in dark and spooky locations. The character, who is the narrator, is initially afraid of the pants, which are able to stand freely despite the lack of a wearer. However, when he screams for help, the pants also start to cry and he realizes that \\"they were just as scared as I!\\" The empty pants and the narrator become friends. This is one of the few Seuss works in verse that is not anapestic tetrameter.  Distribution by NATO in Bosnia  In 1998 NATO translated the collection into Serbo-Croatian and planned to distribute 500,000 copies to children in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of a campaign to encourage tolerance. This was later scaled back to 50,000 copies at a cost of $120,000 as well as looking for a more appropriate source of funding such as an NGO, private charity or corporation, as this expenditure did not meet the 'Minimum Military Requirement\\" test for NATO common funding eligibility.

It was first recorded in 1914.  The dance  In this dance, the man continually goes forward and the lady backward. In order that the lady may be properly guided about the room, the man's arm encircles her just under her arm, while her left hand rests on the man's right arm. The position of the lady's right arm and the man's left arm is high, with their hands clasped, see the illustration.the description from An American Ballroom Companion The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady backward with her right, simply walking with gliding steps keeping on the toes, one count of the music to each step. This step is continued to the end of the room, where a large circle is begun, which is gradually made smaller and smaller, until it is ended by whirling completely around three times, to three counts of the music and then dip. The Castle Walk may be varied by describing the figure eight or zig-zag instead of the large circle. To make the three whirls is rather a difficult matter, as it must be done very rapidly to accomplish a complete revolution to one beat of the music, but with a little practice it is soon learned.

Such timber trackways have existed since at least Neolithic times. History An early example is the Sweet Track that Neolithic people built in the Somerset levels, England, around 6000 years ago.

Duckboards Australian soldiers walking along duckboards during the Battle of Passchendaele A duckboard is a type of boardwalk placed over muddy and wet ground. During World War I, duckboards were used to line the bottom of trenches on the Western Front because these were regularly flooded,Imperial War Museum, and mud and water would lie in the trenches for months on end. The boards helped to keep the soldiers' feet dry and prevent the development of trench foot, caused by prolonged standing in waterlogged conditions. They also allowed for troops' easier movement through the trench systems. Combat troops on nearly all sides routinely wore hobnail-style trench boots that often slipped on the new duck boards when they were wet, and required extra caution. Falling or slipping off the duckboards could often be dangerous, even fatal. Unfortunate soldiers were left struggling to rise under the weight of their equipment in the intractable and sometimes deep water or mud. If this happened at ground level during a tactical advance, the rising soldier could be left a defenseless target for enemy fire as well as hinder forward progress. He could also simply go unnoticed in the ensuing melee, and easily drown under his heavy equipment.Imperial War Museum In the United States The boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland, a wooden pathway adjacent to the beach that is lined with businesses, typical of boardwalks along the East Coast of the United States. Many waterfront commercial boardwalks in the United States have become so successful as tourist attractions that the simple wooden pathways have been replaced by esplanades made of concrete, brick or other construction, sometimes with a wooden facade on the surface and sometimes not. One of the earliest such boardwalks was designed in New Jersey and opened June 26, 1870, in Atlantic City.

Rock formations are usually the result of weathering and erosion sculpting the existing rock. The term rock formation can also refer to specific sedimentary strata or other rock unit in stratigraphic and petrologic studies. A rock structure can be created in any rock type or combination: * Igneous rocks are created when molten rock cools and solidifies, with or without crystallization. They may be either plutonic bodies or volcanic extrusives. Again, erosive forces sculpt their current forms. * Metamorphic rocks are created by rocks that have been transformed into another kind of rock, usually by some combination of heat, pressure, and chemical alteration. * Sedimentary rocks are created by a variety of processes but usually involving deposition, grain by grain, layer by layer, in water or, in the case of terrestrial sediments, on land through the action of wind or sometimes moving ice. Erosion later exposes them in their current form. Geologists have created a number of terms to describe different rock structures in the landscape that can be formed by natural processes: * Butte * Cliff * Escarpment * Gorge * Inselberg, or monadnock * Mesa * Peak * Promontory * River cliff * Sea cliff * Stack * Stone run * Tor Here is a list of rock formations by continent.

simple dance in which many graceful figures may be introduced. It is done to the same music as the Hesitation Waltz and Dream Waltz. The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady backward with her right, simply walking to waltz time, counting one, two, three to each step. At each step the dancers rise on their toes. Four of these steps are taken forward (backward by the lady), then they balance backward and forward. As the dancers balance they make a quarter turn to the man's right to the one, two, three count of the music--four of these quarter turns making the complete revolution. Throughout this turn the man keeps his right foot and the lady her left on the floor, using it as a pivot on which to turn. Now the man steps backward with his left foot and the lady forward with her right, taking four steps. Then balance, and instead of four quarter turns to the one, two, three count of the music, make two half turns in the same time. The dance includes a great deal of \\"balancing\\". Indeed, the Walking Boston cannot be performed easily or gracefully unless the balancing is done properly. Balancing means throwing the weight of the body successively on to one foot and then on the other. This is done with one foot well in advance of the other. Good dancers get plenty of swing into their action. Swing forward. Swing backward. In balancing on to the forward foot, the backward foot should barely leave the floor, and in no event should it be brought forward. And in balancing onto the backward foot the forward foot should not be brought backward. The above are the fundamental figures of the Walking Boston. There is no rule governing the number of steps to be taken forward or back, the number of times to balance, or the number of turns to be made. This is left entirely to the pleasure of the dancers. The number four mentioned in the preceding was merely illustrative. The fundamental figures may be varied by skipping, the man on his left foot, the lady on her right. This skipping step is made by the man on his left foot only, and by the lady on her right only, thus making every other step a skipping step. Another figure may be introduced by the couple taking a position both facing forward. Four steps are taken forward, dipping on the fourth step (see Illustration 11), then back four steps and turn. Couple starts forward, the man with his left foot and the lady with her right, taking three steps, making a little skip as the third step is taken; this skip is on the man's right foot and the lady's left; they balance twice, then repeat. The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady with her right, taking five steps forward, skipping on each step. Balance twice, then turn the body around without changing the position of the arms and take four steps in the opposite direction, skipping on each step as before; then turn as described previously. It is common for dancers to do the turn after each of the figures, but the order of the figures is optional with the dancers. #Both starting with the left foot, take four steps forward; on the fifth step, change position, the man crossing over behind the lady without releasing the hands or losing a step; three more steps forward and then cross back again; then three more steps forward. In other words, this is merely twelve steps forward, changes of position being made on the fifth and ninth steps. Completion of these twelve steps leaves the dancers in the same position as at the start. #Now, without losing a step or getting out of time with the music, both dancers one step straight to the side with the left foot, then backward with the right foot and dip. Again sideways with the left foot and backward with the right and dip, and so on for ten or twelve steps, keeping on a straight line to the left. #Repeat # 1. #Grapevine, dipping on the backward step.

She released her debut album, Today, in 2003. She was a member of hip-hop group, Foreign Heights, with MC Trey and DJ Nick Toth, which released a self-titled album in 2007. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 the trio was nominated for 'Best Urban Release' for \\"Get Yours (Remix)\\". From 2004 to 2008, Jupiter hosted the national radio station, Triple J's weekly Hip-Hop Show. Thereafter she pursued her solo career based in Los Angeles and released her second album, Maya Jupiter, in December 2010. Biography Maya Jupiter was born as Melissha Martinez on 21 December 1978 in La Paz, Mexico. Her father is Mexican and her mother is Turkish. She has an elder sister. Her family moved to Melbourne, Victoria when Jupiter was one year old, then relocated to Sydney, when she was four. From four to twelve years old, she grew up in Busby, a suburb in South-western Sydney and then lived in Ashfield. Her parents provided a wide range of musical experience, \\"At home, we always had different styles of music playing ... [m]y mum used to play classical music, traditional Turkish and pop music, but she was also into jazz and soul. My father used to listen to Spanish-language music\\". In primary school Jupiter was a school captain, and in secondary school she became a prefect and a sports captain. At the age of 14, she wrote her first rhyme. Her sister took her to local salsa and Latin American clubs. In public Jupiter mostly used English and did not speak much Spanish until she was 17, later she reflected, \\"I speak more Spanish than I do Turkish! But I was raised by my Mum, so she reminds me that I should be making more Turkish music\\". At the age of 18, she adopted her stage name using her mother's advice, \\"to reflect the Mayan side of her heritage\\" and began performing in an R&B; club in Sydney. In 1998, Jupiter was introduced to the Australian hip hop scene at the Urban Xpressions Festival. One of her early inspirations was Trey, \\"That was the direction I wanted to go in, and it was nice to have a female role model\\". From 2001 she started recording tracks \\"in a piecemeal fashion\\". She had a minor role in the feature film, Lantana, as a dance instructor. In August 2003 Jupiter released her first album, Today, on Mother Tongues ‚Äì the first label in the world dedicated to developing women in Hip-Hop music. \\"Mamacita\\" was a track dedicated to her mother, \\"[it] was about the divorce of my parents and I guess it was very personal ... very full on. ... I needed to get out about my father because I didn't see him for about seven years, which I think incited the whole fascination of wanting to know about the Mexican culture\\". Also that year, she worked with eleven-piece Latin, jazz, hip-hop band, Son Veneno, and accompanied them to The Belligen Global Music Festival. The combination have since performed at numerous festivals including Homebake, Bacardi Festival and supported American singer, Kelis. By August 2003, Jupiter was also a regular host for shows such as Soul Kitchen and Freestyle on television video outlet, Channel V, and held hip-hop / rap workshops in community centres. She took over as host of national radio station Triple J's weekly music program, Hip Hop Show, in 2004. In 2006, Jupiter joined with fellow rap artist MC Trey and DJ Nick Toth to form the group, Foreign Heights. They released their first single, \\"It Goes On\\", featuring Mr Zux in November of that year. In January 2007 their self-titled album was released in Australia and they performed at the Big Day Out. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2007 Foreign Heights was nominated for 'Best Urban Release' for \\"Get Yours (Remix)\\". On 14 April 2008, Hau, frontman of Koolism, took over Jupiter's role as host of the Hip Hop Show, and she left Australia to further her solo career in Los Angeles.Triple J ‚Äì Hip Hop Show In December 2010, Jupiter released her second album, Maya Jupiter with Blacc assisting on recording and Quetzal Flores and Martha Gonzalez (both are members of Quetzal) co-producing. OC Weeklys reviewer, Gabriel San Roman described the album as \\"an innovative collection of songs anchored in lyrical themes of social justice and Son Jarocho vibes\\" and was pleased by \\"[t]he sample-free, original instrumentation [which] adds to her music's unique appeal. A Latin American harp, requintos, jaranas, electric guitars, trumpets and keys round out her melodies, and there's a striking use of live percussion instruments such as the quijada, caj√≥n, tarima and pandiero instead of MPC drum beats\\". Jupiter is married to American rapper and singer Aloe Blacc. In September 2013, they had their first child, a girl named Mandela.

Many such games incorporate resources such as sound effects, music, or pictures. Blorb's purpose is to bind these together into one file. The format was devised by Andrew Plotkin and is used in both the Z-machine and Glulx virtual machines, as well as by the Glk library.  Concept  In the days when games were distributed only on disk, there was no problem in associating a game with its resources: the resources were simply shipped on the same disk. Since all Z-machine games were produced by Infocom, there was also no chance that resources would be shipped in a format which a user's interpreter program could not handle. Blorb is needed because neither of these assumptions hold true in modern times: games are typically downloaded as single files, and a user may be using any of a large number of interpreters. A Blorb file may optionally include the executable code of the game itself. This allows authors of modern games to ship one file containing everything needed to play the game, while also allowing the creation of resource files for classic Infocom games without running the risk of copyright infringement by distributing Infocom's Z-machine executable code. Glulx games are almost always shipped in the Blorb format. A rather smaller proportion of Z-machine games make use of it, since Z-machine games often rely only on text, and so have no need for the extra resources. As of 2004 Blorb files are supported by all Glk interactive fiction interpreters, including Nitfol and Glulxe. The Blorb format continues the tradition of naming interactive fiction tools after spells in Infocom's Enchanter trilogy. Blorb was a spell to bind objects into boxes. Blorb is an IFF format, with FORM IFRS. The MIME type commonly in use is \\"application/x-blorb\\", and the filename extension is \\".blorb\\", or, for systems where filename extensions are limited to three characters, \\".blb\\". Blorb files containing Z-code games may be named with the extension \\".zblorb\\" or \\".zlb\\"; or, for Glulx games, \\".gblorb\\" or \\".glb\\".

He was a leading figure of the Ashcan School of American realism and an organizer of the group known as \\"The Eight,\\" a loose association of artists who protested the restrictive exhibition practices of the powerful, conservative National Academy of Design.  Early life  Robert Henri was born Robert Henry Cozad in Cincinnati, Ohio to Theresa Gatewood Cozad and John Jackson Cozad, a gambler and real estate developer.Homer (1969).Perlman (1991). Henri was a distant cousin of the painter Mary Cassatt.Perlman (1991), p. 1. In 1871, Henri's father founded the town of Cozaddale, Ohio. In 1873, the family moved west to Nebraska, where John J. Cozad founded the town of Cozad.Henshaw (1957): \\"Cozad, Nebraska, finally has found its founder after, lo, these many moons.\\" In October 1882, Henri's father became embroiled in a dispute with a rancher, Alfred Pearson, over the right to pasture cattle on land claimed by the family. When the dispute turned physical, Cozad shot Pearson fatally with a pistol. Cozad was eventually cleared of wrongdoing, but the mood of the town turned against him. He fled to Denver, Colorado, and the rest of the family followed shortly afterwards. In order to disassociate themselves from the scandal, family members changed their names. The father became known as Richard Henry Lee, and his sons posed as adopted children under the names Frank Southern and Robert Earl Henri (pronounced \\"hen rye\\"). In 1883, the family moved to New York City, then to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where the young artist completed his first paintings.Homer (1969), p. 7.  Education  In 1886, Henri enrolled at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where he studied under Thomas Anshutz, a protege of Thomas Eakins, and Thomas Hovenden.Homer (1969), pp. 25‚Äì27. In 1888, he traveled to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Julian,oxfordindex.oup.com where he studied under the academic realist William-Adolphe Bouguereau, came to admire greatly the work of Francois Millet, and embraced Impressionism. \\"His European study had helped Henri develop rather catholic tastes in art.\\"Homer (1969), p. 65. He was admitted into the √âcole des Beaux Arts. He visited Brittany and Italy during this period. At the end of 1891, he returned to Philadelphia, studying under Robert Vonnoh at the Pennsylvania Academy. In 1892, he began teaching at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women. \\"A born teacher, Henry enjoyed immediate success at the school.\\"Homer (1969), p. 71.  Work  In Philadelphia, Henri began to attract a group of followers who met in his studio to discuss art and culture, including several illustrators for the Philadelphia Press who would become known as the \\"Philadelphia Four\\": William Glackens, George Luks, Everett Shinn, and John Sloan. They called themselves the Charcoal Club. Their gatherings featured life drawing, raucous socializing, and readings and discussions of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, √âmile Zola, Henry David Thoreau, William Morris Hunt, and George Moore. =Ashcan School= By 1895, Henri had come to reconsider his earlier love of Impressionism, calling it a \\"new academicism.\\" He was urging his friends and proteges to create a new, more realistic art that would speak directly to their own time and experience. He believed that it was the right moment for American painters to seek out fresh, less genteel subjects in the modern American city. The paintings by Henri, Sloan, Glackens, Luks, Shinn, and others of their acquaintance that were inspired by this outlook eventually came to be called the Ashcan School of American art. They spurned academic painting and Impressionism as an art of mere surfaces. Art critic Robert Hughes declared that, \\"Henri wanted art to be akin to journalism. He wanted paint to be as real as mud, as the clods of horse-shit and snow, that froze on Broadway in the winter, as real a human product as sweat, carrying the unsuppressed smell of human life.\\" Ashcan painters began to attract public attention in the same decade in which the realist fiction of Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Frank Norris was finding its audience and the muckraking journalists were calling attention to slum conditions.Hunter (1959), pp. 28‚Äì40. Snow in New York, 1902, oil on canvas, National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC For several years, Henri divided his time between Philadelphia and Paris, where he met the Canadian artist James Wilson Morrice.Homer (1969), p. 86. Morrice introduced Henri to the practice of painting pochades on tiny wood panels that could be carried in a coat pocket along with a small kit of brushes and oil. This method facilitated the kind of spontaneous depictions of urban scenes which would come to be associated with his mature style. In 1898, Henri married Linda Craige, a student from his private art class. The couple spent the next two years on an extended honeymoon in France, during which time Henri prepared canvases to submit to the Salon.Homer (1969), pp. 90‚Äì94. In 1899 he exhibited \\"Woman in Manteau\\" and La Neige (\\"The Snow\\"), which was purchased by the French government for display in the Mus√©e du Luxembourg.Homer (1969), p. 119. He taught at the Veltin School for Girls beginning in 1900 and at the New York School of Art in 1902, where his students included Joseph Stella, Edward Hopper, Rockwell Kent, George Bellows, Norman Raeben, Louis D. Fancher, and Stuart Davis. In 1905, Linda, long in poor health, died. Three years later, Henri remarried; his new wife, Marjorie Organ, was a twenty-two-year-old cartoonist for the New York Journal.Homer (1969), p. 146. (Henri's 1911 portrait of Marjorie, The Masquerade Dress, is one of his most famous paintings and hangs in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) In 1906, Henri was elected to the National Academy of Design, but when painters in his circle were rejected for the Academy's 1907 exhibition, he accused fellow jurors of bias and walked off the jury, resolving to organize a show of his own. He would later refer to the Academy as \\"a cemetery of art.\\" =The Eight= Salome, 1909, John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida In 1908, Henri was one of the organizers of a landmark show entitled \\"The Eight\\" (after the eight painters displaying their works) at the Macbeth Galleries in New York. Besides his own works and those produced by the \\"Philadelphia Four\\" (who had followed Henri to New York by this time), three other artists who painted in a different, less realistic style‚ÄîMaurice Prendergast, Ernest Lawson, and Arthur B. Davies‚Äîwere included. The exhibition was intended as a protest against the exhibition policies and narrowness of taste of the National Academy of Design. The show later traveled to several cities from Newark to Chicago, prompting further discussion in the press about the revolt against academic art and the new ideas about acceptable subject matter in painting. Henri was, by this point, at the heart of the group who argued for the depiction of urban life at its toughest and most exuberant. Conservative tastes were necessarily affronted. About Henri's Salome of 1909, critic Hughes observed: \\"Her long legs thrust out with strutting sexual arrogance and glint through the over-brushed back veil. It has far more oomph than hundreds of virginal, genteel muses, painted by American academics. He has given it urgency with slashing brush marks and strong tonal contrasts. He's learned from Winslow Homer, from √âdouard Manet, and from the vulgarity of Frans Hals\\".Hughes (1997), p. 325. In 1910, with the help of John Sloan and Walt Kuhn, Henri organized the Exhibition of Independent Artists, the first nonjuried, no-prize show in the U.S., which he modeled after the Salon des Ind√©pendants in France. Works were hung alphabetically to emphasize an egalitarian philosophy. The exhibition was very well-attended but resulted in few sales.Homer (1969), pp. 152‚Äì156. The relationship between Henri and Sloan, both believers in Ashcan realism, was a close and productive one at this time; Kuhn would play a key role in the 1913 Armory Show. Biographer William Innes Homer writes: \\"Henri's emphasis on freedom and independence in art [as demonstrated in the Exhibition of Independent Artists], his rebuttal of everything the National Academy stood for, makes him the ideological father of the Armory Show.\\"Homer (1969), p. 155. The Armory Show, American's first large-scale introduction to European Modernism, was a mixed experience for Henri. He exhibited five paintings but, as a representational artist, he naturally understood that Cubism, Fauvism, and Futurism implied a challenge to his style of picture-making. In fact, he had cause to be worried. A man, not yet fifty, who saw himself in a vanguard was about to be relegated to the position of a conservative whose day had passed. Arthur B. Davies, an organizer of the show and a member of The Eight, was particularly disdainful of Henri's concern that the new European art would overshadow the work of American artists. On the other hand, some Henri scholars have insisted that the reputation Henri earned in later histories as an opponent of the Armory Show and of Modernism in general is unfair and vastly overstates his objections.Rose (1975) refers to Henri as \\"blind and hostile\\" to Picasso and Matisse (p. 30). They point out that he had a keen interest in new art and recommended that his students avail themselves of opportunities to study it.Homer (1969), p. 174. Art historian Sarah Vure notes that \\"[as] early as 1910, Henri advised students to attend an exhibition of works by Henri Matisse and two years later he urged them to see the work of Max Weber, one of the most avant-garde of American moderns.\\" He urged painter Charles Sheeler to visit the Albert C. Barnes collection of modern art in Pennsylvania.Vure (2009), p. 57. Never a conservative politically, Henri admired anarchist and Mother Earth publisher Emma Goldman and taught from 1911 at the Modern School. Goldman, who later sat for a portrait by Henri, described him as \\"an anarchist in his conception of art and its relation to life.\\" =Ireland and Santa Fe= Mary Agnes, one of the children of Dooagh (1924) Henri made several trips to Ireland's western coast and rented Corrymore House near Dooagh, a small village on Achill Island, in 1913. Every spring and summer for the following years he would paint the children of Dooagh. Henri's portraits of children, seen today as the most sentimental aspect of his body of work, were popular at the time and sold well. In 1924, he purchased Corrymore House.Perlman (1991), p. 133. During the summers of 1916, 1917 and 1922, Henri went to Santa Fe, New Mexico to paint. He found that locale as inspirational as the countryside of Ireland had been. He became an important figure in the Santa Fe art scene and persuaded the director of the state art museum to adopt an open-door exhibition policy. He also persuaded fellow artists George Bellows, Leon Kroll, John Sloan and Randall Davey to come to Santa Fe. In 1918 he was elected as an associate member of the Taos Society of Artists. =Death and burial= While traveling to the United States after visiting his summer home in Ireland in November 1928, Robert Henri suffered an attack of neuritis, which crippled his leg. The underlying cause was metastatic prostate cancer.Perlman (1991), p. 135. He was hospitalized at St. Luke's Hospital in New York. Gradually he became weaker, until he died of cardiac arrest early in the morning of July 12, 1929. His illness was not generally known, and came as a surprise in art circles. Upon his death, artist and pupil Eugene Speicher said \\"not only was he a great painter, but ... I don't think it too much to call him the father of independent painting in this country.\\" At his death, it was reported that he was cremated, and his ashes buried in the family vault in Philadelphia. Influence and legacy From 1915 to 1927, Henri was a popular and influential teacher at the Art Students League of New York. \\"He gave his students, not a style (though some imitated him), but an attitude, an approach, [to art].\\"Homer (1969), p. 269. He also lectured frequently about the theories of Hardesty Maratta, Denham Waldo Ross, and Jay Hambidge.Homer (1969), pp. 184‚Äì194. (Henri's interest in these men, whose ideas were in fashion at the time but were not taken seriously later, has proved to be \\"the most misunderstood aspect of [Henri's] pedagogy\\").Vure (2009), p. 60. Maratta and Ross were color theorists (Maratta manufactured his own system of synthetic pigments), while Hambidge was the author of an elaborate treatise, Dynamic Symmetry, that argued for a scientific basis for composition. Henri's philosophical and practical musings were collected by former pupil Margery Ryerson and published as The Art Spirit (1923), a book that remained in print for several decades. Henri's other students include George Bellows, Arnold Franz Brasz, Stuart Davis, Edward Hopper, Rockwell Kent, Henry Ives Cobb, Jr., Lillian Cotton, John Sloan, Minerva TeichertJan Underwood Pinborough, Minerva Kohlhepp Teichert: With a Bold BrushWardle (2005), p. 206. and Yasuo Kuniyoshi. The significance and often formative influence of Henri as a teacher and mentor to women artists was acknowledged in American Women Modernists: The Legacy of Robert Henri (2005). Comparing the work of Henri's female students to their male Ashcan School contemporaries, Marion Wardle asserts, \\"An examination of their experiments in many media illuminates a much broader application of Henri's modernist ideals. ...Henri's women students contributed significantly to the structure of American modernism. They produced a large body of work, exhibited widely, won major art awards, belonged to and administered arts organizations, and taught art classes across America.\\"Wardle (2005), p. 4. In the spring of 1929, Henri was named as one of the top three living American artists by the Arts Council of New York. Henri died of cancer that summer at the age of sixty-four. He was eulogized by colleagues and former students and was honored with a memorial exhibition of seventy-eight paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Forbes Watson, editor of The Arts magazine wrote, \\"Henri, quite aside from his extraordinary personal charm, was an epoch-making man in the development of American art.\\"Homer (1969), p. 209. Fittingly, among Henri's most enduring works are his portraits of his fellow painters. His 1904 full-length portrait of George Luks (in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa) and his 1904 portrait of John Sloan (in the collection of The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.), for example, exhibit all the classic elements of his style: forceful brushwork, intense (if dark) color effects, evocation of personality (his and the sitter's), and generosity of spirit. The Robert Henri Museum in Cozad, Nebraska occupies one of Henri's former homes and focuses on his work. The National Arts Club in New York City is home to the Robert Henri Library which includes artwork and a number of scrapbooks belonging to Henri. The Library is made available to qualifying scholars and professionals. Henri became an Artist Life Member of the Club in 1913.

The original 1891 version of the play was in French. Three years later an English translation was published. The play tells in one act the Biblical story of stepdaughter of the tetrarch Herod Antipas (identified as Salome by historian Josephus), who, to her stepfather's dismay but to the delight of her mother Herodias, requests the head of Jokanaan (John the Baptist) on a silver platter as a reward for pleasing Herod for her dancing, which is described for the first time in this play as the dance of the seven veils.

The play was first published in French in February 1893, and an English translation, with illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley, in February 1894. On the Dedication page, Wilde indicated that his lover Lord Alfred Douglas was the translator. In fact, Wilde and Douglas had quarrelled over the latter's translation of the text which had been nothing short of disastrous given his poor mastery of French ‚Äì though Douglas claimed that the errors were really in Wilde's original play. Beardsley and the publisher John Lane got drawn in when they sided with Wilde. In a gesture of reconciliation, Wilde did the work himself but dedicated Douglas as the translator rather than having them sharing their names on the title-page. Douglas compared a dedication to sharing the title-page as \\"the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman.\\"Ellmann, Richard. Oscar Wilde, 1987 The play was eventually premiered on 11 February 1896, while Wilde was in prison, in Paris at the Com√©die-Parisienne (at the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre in some accounts)Peter Raby, Introduction, p. xiii The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays, Oxford, Worlds Classics, 2008 in a staging by Lugn√©-Poe's theatre group, the Th√©√¢tre de l'≈íuvre. In Pall Mall Gazette of 29 June 1892 Wilde explained, why he had written Salom√© in French: :\\"I have one instrument that I know I can command, and that is the English language. There was another instrument to which I had listened all my life, and I wanted once to touch this new instrument to see whether I could make any beautiful thing out of it. [...] Of course, there are modes of expression that a Frenchman of letters would not have used, but they give a certain relief or colour to the play. A great deal of the curious effect that Maeterlinck produces comes from the fact that he, a Flamand by grace, writes in an alien language. The same thing is true of Rossetti, who, though he wrote in English, was essentially Latin in temperament.\\"cited by Archibald Henderson in Overland Monthly No. 1, July 1907. p. 14 archive.org Maud Allan as Salom√© with the head of John the Baptist in Vision of Salom√©, her 1906 loose adaptation of Wilde's play. She was billed as \\"The Salom√© Dancer\\". A performance of the play was arranged by the New Stage Club at the Bijou Theatre in Archer Street, London, on 10 and 13 May 1905, starring Millicent Murby as Salom√© and directed by Florence Farr. In June 1906 the play was presented privately with A Florentine Tragedy by the Literary Theatre Society at King's Hall, Covent Garden. The Lord Chamberlain's ban was not lifted for almost forty years; the first public performance of Salom√© in England was produced by Nancy Price at the Savoy Theatre on 5 October 1931. She took the role of Herodias herself and cast her daughter Joan Maude as Salom√©.Ellis, Samantha. \\"Salom√©, Savoy Theatre, October 1931\\", 26 March 2003, accessed 22 February 2013 In 1992 the play was performed on Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theatre, under the direction of Robert Allan Ackerman. Sheryl Lee starred as the title role alongside Al Pacino. The play costarred Suzanne Bertish, Esai Morales and Arnold Vosloo. Al Pacino said in an interview that a new production of the play where he will star as King Herod is to open in London's West End in 2016.Mitford, Oliver. \\"Salom√© ‚Äì Could Al Pacino make a return to the West End?\\", 22 November 2014, accessed 24 November 2014 In 2018 a production by Lazarus Theatre performed at Greenwich Theatre. Directed by Ricky Dukes, the performance portrayed Salom√© as male. Origins and themes Wilde had considered the subject since he had first been introduced to H√©rodias, one of Flaubert's Trois Contes, by Walter Pater, at Oxford in 1877. His interest had been further stimulated by descriptions of Gustave Moreau's paintings of Salom√© in Joris-Karl Huysmans's √Ä rebours. Other literary influences include Heinrich Heine's Atta Troll, Laforgue's Salom√© in Moralit√©s L√©gendaires and Mallarm√©'s H√©rodiade.Peter Raby, Introduction, p. xi The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays. Oxford, Worlds Classics, 2008 Wilde's interest in Salom√©'s image had been stimulated by descriptions of Gustave Moreau's paintings in Joris-Karl Huysmans's √Ä rebours. Many view Wilde's Salom√© as a superb composite of these earlier treatments of the theme overlaid, in terms of dramatic influences, with Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck's characteristic methodical diction,Stalpaert, Christel ; Oostveldt, Bram Van; Schoor, Jaak Van. ‚ÄúEnter Ghost ...‚Äù : The linguistic, theatrical and post-dramatic afterlife of Shakespeare‚Äôs Hamlet in Flanders.

Salome's Modernity: Oscar Wilde and the Aesthetics of Transgression pp 60‚Äì61. and specifically Maeterlinck's La Princesse Maleine, 'with its use of colour, sound, dance, visual description and visual effect'. Wilde often referred to the play in musical terms and believed that recurring phrases 'bind it together like a piece of music with recurring motifs. ' Although the \\"kissing of the head\\" element was used in Heine and even Joseph Converse Heywood'sHeywood, Joseph Converse, Salome. A dramatic poem (1867)Ellmann, Richard Wilde and the Legend of Salom√© in the Nineteenth Century Oscar Wilde. London Hamish Hamilton, 1987, pp 375‚Äì76.Highsmith, Stacee L.

While his debts are undeniable, there are some interesting contributions in Wilde's treatment, most notably being his persistent use of parallels between Salom√© and the moon. Alice Guszalewicz as Salome in the Richard Strauss opera, c. 1910. Richard Ellmann misidentified this photograph in his 1987 biography as \\"Wilde in costume as Salome,\\" the error being finally corrected in 2000.The Importance of Not Being Salome. The Guardian. Actress Margarita Xirgu in the Spanish premiere in 1910 in Barcelona Christopher Nassaar pointed out that Wilde employs a number of the images favoured by Israel's kingly poets and that the moon is meant to suggest the pagan goddess Cybele, who, like Salom√©, was obsessed with preserving her virginity and thus took pleasure in destroying male sexuality.Nassaar, Christopher S. Wilde's Salom√© and the Victorian Religious Landscape. Following the prelude three demarcated episodes follow: the meeting between Salom√© and Iokanaan, the phase of the white moon; the major public central episode, the dance and the beheading, the phase of the red moon; and finally the conclusion, when the black cloud conceals the moon.Peter Raby, Introduction, p.xiv The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays, Oxford, Worlds Classics, 2008 An argument is made by Brad Bucknell in his essay, \\"On \\"Seeing\\" Salom√©\\" that the play can be seen as a struggle between the visual, in the form of various characters' gazing as well as Salom√©'s dance, and the written word. Salome's dance (which is never described) overpowers Iokannan's prophecies, and Salom√© herself dies due to Herod's command to crush her. As Bucknell writes of Salom√©'s dance, \\"The power of the word is inverted, turned back upon its possessors, the prophet and the ruler-figure of the tetrarch.\\"\\"On \\"Seeing\\" Salome. ELH. Vol. 60, No. 2, Summer, 1993. The idea of the gaze‚Äîspecifically the male gaze‚Äîis also explored by Linda and Michael Hutcheon in \\"\\"Here's Lookin' At You, Kid\\": The Empowering Gaze in Salom√©.\\" In their essay, the two write that Salom√©'s body \\"clearly becomes the focus of the attention‚Äîand the literal eye‚Äîof both audience and characters. As dancer, Salom√© is without a doubt the object of the gaze‚Äîparticularly Herod's male gaze.\\" The Hutcheons argue that while the male gaze has been traditionally rooted in the idea of sexual privilege, leading to a gendering of the gaze as 'male' in the first place, the character of Salom√© undermines this theory by knowingly using the male gaze to her advantage, first by gaining access to Iokannan via the male gaze and later through her dance.\\"Here's Lookin' At You, Kid: The Empowering Gaze in Salome\\" However, others argue that the female gaze is also present in the play, with Salome gazing and objectifying Iokannan. As critic Carmen Skaggs writes, \\"Syrian, Herod, and Salom√© objectify the subjects of their gazes. They admire each one for his/her beauty alone. The desires of all three are forbidden and recognized as dangerous by those around them, but they are not persuaded to turn away\\".Skaggs, Carmen Trammell, \\"Modernity's Revision of the Dancing Daughter: The Salom√© Narrative of Wilde and Strauss\\". College Literature Vol. 29, No. 3, Literature and the Visual Arts (Summer, 2002), pp. 124‚Äì139 Skaggs also discusses in her essay \\"Modernity's Revision of the Dancing Daughter: The Salome Narrative of Wilde and Strauss‚Äù the possible homosexual subtext of Wilde's play. Skaggs points to one instance in the play when Salome promises Narraboth a flower, a signal of homosexuality in Wilde's time. Skaggs and other critics argue that Salom√©'s sexuality is presented as typically masculine, which makes the relationship between her and the Young Syrian border on the homoerotic. Skaggs also argues that Wilde is attempting to explore different forms of worship, with Salome, the Young Syrian, and Herod worshiping beauty and serving as contrasts for the religious Iokannan, whose worship revolves around God. Salome is not named, but only referenced as \\"Herodias' daughter\\" in the Biblical story (Mark 6:22, Matthew 14:6), but Wilde chooses to make the focal point of the play the perversion of lust and desire of Salom√© rather than Herodias vengeance on John the Baptist. He uses the sexual power of the dance to construct lustful emotions, which are barred out in the biblical text. The depiction of Salome as a pawn to her mother Herodias diminishes her image as a woman of manipulation, but Wilde portrays her as a woman of power and manipulator creating this femme fatale manifestation. The kissing of John's severed head testifies to this ideal of what Bram Dijkstra calls \\"the virgin whore\\", a perversion of purity tainted by lustful desires.Albin, Tania. \\"The Biblical Story of Salom√©.\\" The Biblical Story of Salom√©. Brown University, 26 December 2006. Web. 24 March 2014 Joseph Donahue, a theatre historian, believes that Wilde uses poetic license in filling in narrative gaps from the accounts of the head on the platter story, to tease out explicitly what was written implicitly.Marrapodi, Eric. \\"A Head on a Silver Platter ‚Äì Rethinking John the Baptist and Oscar Wilde.\\" CNN Belief Blog RSS. CNN, 2 February 2012. Web. 24 March 2014. Despite the similarities, Wilde's depiction mixes legend with biblical history, the temporal with the eternal, but also blends form and medium creating a complex rendition of sensual repulsion.Thuleen, Nancy. \\"Salome: A Wildean Symbolist Drama.\\" 19 December 1995. Wilde's recreation of this biblical horror based upon lust and manipulation of Salome's passion is its own downfall. Significance of the Dance One of the primary concepts that Oscar Wilde altered in his play was the significance that the dance gets emphasised, ultimately putting it at the very core of the play. Little information had originally been provided by the Bible, with Mark's gospel simply stating, \\"When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests\\" (Mark 6:22). Indeed, the daughter (Salome) isn't described in any detail whatsoever ‚Äì in fact, it isn't until the early fifth century that Salom√© was even given as her name. During this period, Salom√©'s dance was mainly used by early church leaders as an example to warn against such sinfulness as the temptations of women, as well as to introduce the element of sex itself ‚Äì such as Johannes Chrysostomos, who stated in the late 4th century, \\"Wherever there is a dance, the devil is also present. God did not give us our feet for dancing, but so that we might walk on the path of righteousness.\\"Ziolkowski, Theodore \\"The Veil as Metaphor and as Myth\\" Religion & Literature Vol. 40, No. 2 (Summer 2008), pp. 61‚Äì81. From this point forward, however, the Salom√© narrative continually evolves ‚Äì and often quite dramatically so, ultimately left bearing little resemblance to how it was used/understood in the earliest days of the Church. In Carmen Skaggs' \\"Modernity's Revision of the Dancing Daughter: The Salom√© Narrative of Wilde and Strauss‚Äù she intimates that by expanding upon the dance in his play, ‚ÄúWilde, as a Decadent writer in the nineteenth century, develops the themes of Orientalism and counter-cultural ethics. He enters the chasm of human emotion and reveals both the savage and noble heights to which humanity ascends. He explores the deeply ingrained gender ideologies of modernity and the sexual perversities of modern culture,\\" and \\"by focusing the narrative upon the dancing daughter and empowering her sexuality, Wilde brings new dimension to her character.\\" Theodore Ziolkowski, in his \\"The Veil as Metaphor and as Myth,\\" continues the idea of character development for Salom√© via her dance, and points out that in Wilde's text \\"Salom√© is placed squarely in the center of the action‚Ä¶her mother, fearing that the dance will only cause Herod to lust even more after her daughter, warns her repeatedly not to dance. Indeed, the dance is almost anticlimactic since Herod, unlike the biblical Herod, has already promised Salom√© whatever she wants.\\" And with this in mind, that Salome has the agency to use her dance to her own benefit instead of dancing simply on the command of the lustful Herod, Linda and Michael Hutcheon's claim in \\"'Here's Lookin'at You, Kid': The Empowering Gaze in Salom√©\\" that Salom√© knows the meaning of power and that \\"her dance is a calculated move in a game of exchange with Herod in which she offers her body as a sensual, sexual spectacle to his eyes, in return for a promise that will fulfill both her childlike willful stubbornness and her consuming sexual obsession to kiss the mouth of the resistant prophet,\\" serves to add another, more politically minded layer to Salome's character, and takes the focus from strictly the sexual elements of Salom√©'s performance. Finally, in \\"Scandal and the Dance: Salom√© in the Gospel of Mark,‚Äù Ren√© Girard uses the developed ideas of Salom√© as manipulative and politically savvy, and applies them once over to her dance, saying that her dance represents reckless desire because of the freedom of letting go and moving one's body as well as the fuel for a political scandal, driven by Salom√©'s desire for Jokannan's head. Girard also incorporates Skaggs‚Äô idea of Wilde using different cultures and influences other than the original Biblical story, and claims that Salom√©'s dance becomes pagan and ritualistic because it is performed for Herod's birthday, not a religious holiday, and in this circumstance, Jokannan becomes ritual sacrifice.Girard, Ren√© \\"Scandal and the Dance: Salome in the Gospel of Mark\\". New Literary History Vol. 15, No. 2, Interrelation of Interpretation and Creation (Winter, 1984), pp. 311‚Äì324. Wilde's Salom√© in later art Wilde's version of the story has since spawned several other artistic works, the most famous of which is Richard Strauss's opera of the same name. Strauss saw Wilde's play in Berlin in November 1902, at Max Reinhardt's 'Little Theatre', with Gertrud Eysoldt in the title role, and began to compose his opera in summer 1903, completing it in 1905 and premiering it later the same year. The Strauss opera moves the centre of interest to Salome, away from Herod Antipas. However, it was not the only operatic treatment. Antoine Mariotte also wrote Salom√© in 1905, and he was involved in a debate with Strauss to prove that his music was written earlier than Strauss's version. Mariotte's version was premiered in 1908. The play, and most of the later filmed versions, have Herod as the centre of the action, dominating the play. Strong actors have been used to achieve this, such as Al Pacino in his 1980s Circle in the Square production; and in 2006, in a Los Angeles production. In 1906, Maud Allan created a production entitled Vision of Salom√©, which debuted in Vienna. It was based loosely on Wilde's play. Her version of the dance of the seven veils became famous (and to some notorious) and she was billed as \\"The Salom√© Dancer\\". A production of the play led to a libel case in 1918, when Allan was accused of promoting sexual immorality. In 1918, a silent film adaptation of Wilde's play was released by Fox starring Theda Bara and directed by J. Gordon Edwards. The film, having been a relatively big-budget production exploiting the wildly popular Bara at the height of her \\"vamping\\" career, proved quite popular ‚Äì yet this also contributed to some of the controversy surrounding it. Many churches in the US at the time of its release protested against what they saw as blatant immorality -with an often scantily clad Bara showcasing her sexual appeal to audiences- appearing in a film about religious subject matterProtests Against Showing of Salom√© \\"Protest Against Showing of Salom√©: Church Federations of St. Louis Raise Objection to Theda Bara's Dearth of Attire\\". Moving Picture World (New York City: Chalmers Publishing Company) 39 (4): 476. Jan 25, 1919. Retrieved 25 July 2014 In 1923, a film adaptation of Salom√© directed by Charles Bryant was released. Alla Nazimova, the Russian- American actress, played the protagonist. In 1961, Caffe Cino playwright Doric Wilson wrote a comic re-imagination of Wilde's Salome entitled Now She Dances!. The play was adapted for Australian TV in 1968 with Frank Thring as Herod. The Canon Group produced a film adaptation, Salome in 1986 directed by Claude d'Anna, a lavish period piece highly emphasised with sexual decadence, ambiguous WW2 inspired costumes and a breakthrough performance by Jo Champa in the title role delivering an exhilarating Dance of the Seven Veils. Australian musician Nick Cave wrote a 5-act play entitled Salom√© which is included in the 1988 collection of Cave's writings, King Ink (the play alludes to the Gospel account, Wilde's play, and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes's 1869 painting, The Beheading of John the Baptist). Salom√© by Manuel Orazi Ken Russell directed a film version of the play, Salome's Last Dance (1988), staged as a private performance for Wilde at a brothel. Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1993 musical Sunset Boulevard features a song in Act I entitled \\"Salom√©\\". The song highlights Salom√©'s infatuation with John the Baptist, and foreshadows Norma's obsession and later murder of Joe. Throughout the 1994 movie A Man of No Importance and its 2002 musical adaption, the main character, Alfie, tries to produce a production of Salom√© in his local church, and the play is often quoted and referenced. The 1999 film Cookie's Fortune depicts a small Southern town preparing for a community production of Salom√©, with Camille (Glenn Close) as the director of the play and Cora (Julianne Moore) in the role of Salom√©. In the 1999 film Trick, the character Katherine is in a fictitious variation of Salom√© whose story is set in a women's prison. Aside from seeing characters in striped prison jumpsuits, however, no scene from the play is actually re- enacted. In 2011 Al Pacino revisited Wilde's play, this time with a documentary-drama entitled Wilde Salom√©. A version was released two years later as simply Salom√© minus the documentary elements with the stage performance as its sole focus. Written and Directed by Pacino himself, it featured redheaded Jessica Chastain as a crimson veil clad Salom√©. = Music = Also heavily influenced by the play are The Smashing Pumpkins' video for the song \\"Stand Inside Your Love\\" and U2's \\"Mysterious Ways\\"Mark Wrathall: U2 and Philosophy: How to Decipher an Atomic Band.

In 2009, the game developer Tale of Tales created a computer game called Fatale based on Oscar Wilde's take on the Biblical story. In the first third of the game, the player takes on the role of Iokannan awaiting his execution as Salom√© (unseen) dances above. Quotations from Wilde's Salom√© appear periodically, creating what Tale of Tales calls a \\"whispering soundscape\\". In the second part of the game, the player takes on the role of Iokannan's spirit and is tasked with blowing out the candles in the courtyard. The player is also allowed at this point to examine their surroundings. Salom√© and her mother Herodias can be seen at this point. In the last part of the game, the player can only control the camera as Salom√© dances. It is not outright stated from whose point of view you are watching; however, it may be Herod's as he is absent from the rest of the game. Tale of Tales took visual inspiration from the depictions of Salome painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder, Titian, and Gustave Moreau; from Rita Hayworth's performance of the dance of the seven veils set to Richard Strauss's music, as well as Aubrey Beardsley's illustrations for Wilde's original manuscript. The developers of Fatale have cited \\"the repeated reference to looking and seeing\\" within Wilde's play as forming the core experience of the game.Tale of Tales.

The Master of the Horse was (and in some cases, still is) a position of varying importance in several European nations. Magister Equitum (Ancient Rome) The original Master of the Horse (Latin Magister Equitum) in the Roman Republic was an office appointed and dismissed by the Roman Dictator, as it expired with the Dictator's own office, typically a term of six months in the early and mid-republic. The Magister Equitum served as the Dictator's main lieutenant. The nomination of the Magister Equitum was left to the choice of the Dictator, unless a senatus consultum specified, as was sometimes the case, the name of the person who was to be appointed. The Dictator could not be without a Magister Equitum to assist him, and, consequently, if the first Magister Equitum either died or was dismissed during the Dictator's term, another had to be nominated in his stead. The Magister Equitum was granted a form of imperium, but at the same level as a praetor, and thus was subject to the imperium of the Dictator and was not superior to that of a Consul. In the Dictator's absence, the Magister Equitum became his representative, and exercised the same powers as the Dictator. It was usually but not always necessary for the man nominated as Magister Equitum to have already held the office of Praetor. Accordingly, the Magister Equitum had the insignia of a praetor: the toga praetexta and an escort of six lictors. The most famous Master of the Horse is Mark Antony, who served during Julius Caesar's first dictatorship. After the constitutional reforms of Augustus, the office of Dictator fell into disuse, along with that of the Magister Equitum. The title magister equitum was revived in the late Empire, when Constantine I established it as one of the supreme military ranks, alongside the Magister Peditum (\\"Master of the Foot\\"). Eventually, the two offices would be amalgamated into that of the Magister Militum (\\"Master of the Soldiers\\"). The title Constable, from the Latin comes stabuli or count of the stables, has a similar history. Master of the Horse (United Kingdom) Dress uniform of the Master of the Horse.The Master of the Horse in the United Kingdom was once an important official of the sovereign's household, though the role is largely ceremonial today. The master of the horse is the third dignitary of the court, and was always a member of the ministry (before 1782 the office was of cabinet rank), a peer and a privy councillor. All matters connected with the horses and formerly also the hounds of the sovereign, as well as the stables and coachhouses, the stud, mews and previously the kennels, are within his jurisdiction. The practical management of the Royal Stables and stud devolves on the chief or Crown Equerry, formerly called the Gentleman of the Horse, whose appointment was always permanent. The Clerk Marshal had the supervision of the accounts of the department before they are submitted to the Board of Green Cloth, and was in waiting on the Sovereign on state occasions only. Exclusive of the Crown Equerry there were seven regular equerries, besides extra and honorary equerries, one of whom was always in attendance on the Sovereign and rode at the side of the royal carriage. They were always officers of the army, and each of them was on duty for about the same time as the lords and grooms in waiting. There are still several pages of honour who are nominally in the master of the horse's department, who must not be confounded with the pages of various kinds who are in the department of the Lord Chamberlain. They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen, selected by the sovereign in person, to attend on him at state ceremonies. At the Coronation they assisted the groom of the stole in carrying the royal train. The current Master of the Horse is Lord de Mauley. Today the Master of the Horse has a primarily ceremonial office, and rarely appears except on state occasions, and especially when the Sovereign is mounted. The Crown Equerry has daily oversight of the Royal Mews, which provides vehicular transport for the Sovereign, both cars and horse-drawn carriages. Train travel is arranged by the Royal Travel Office, which also co-ordinates air transport. The Pages of Honour, who appear only on ceremonial occasions, and the Equerries, were nominally under the authority of the Master of the Horse. The former are now controlled by the Keeper of the Privy Purse. The latter are effectively independent, and are functionally closer to the Private Secretary's Office. There are now three equerries to the Sovereign, and a larger number of extra equerries - usually retired officers with some connection to the Royal Household. The extra equerries are rarely if ever required for duty, but the Equerries are in attendance on the Sovereign on a daily basis. For some years the senior Equerry has also held the position of Deputy Master of the Household. The permanent equerry is an officer of major rank or equivalent, recruited from the three armed services in turn. Many previous equerries have gone on to reach high rank. The temporary equerry is a Captain of the Coldstream Guards, who provides part-time attendance. When not required for duty he has additional regimental or staff duties. Senior members of the Royal Family also have one or two equerries. Grand Squire of France In France the master of the horse, known as the Grand Squire of France (Grand √âcuyer, or more usually Monsieur le grand) was one of the seven Great Officers of the Crown of France from 1595. As well as the superintendence of the royal stables, he had that of the retinue of the sovereign, also the charge of the funds set aside for the religious functions of the court, coronations, etc. On the death of a sovereign he had the right to all the horses and their equipment in the royal stables. He oversaw personally the \\"Great Stable\\" (\\"grande √©curie\\"). Distinct from this officer and independent of him, was the first equerry (Premier Ecuyer), who had charge of the horses which the sovereign used personally (La petite √©curie), and who attended on him when he rode out. The office of master of the horse existed down to the reign of Louis XVI. Under Louis XVIII and Charles X the duties were discharged by the first equerry, but under Napoleon I and Napoleon III the office was revived with much of its old importance. Oberststallmeister (Germany) In Germany the master of the horse (Oberststallmeister) was a high court dignitary; but his office was merely titular, the superintendence of the Emperor's stables having been carried out by the Oberstallmeister, an official corresponding to the crown equerry in England. Caballerizo mayor (Spain) The Caballerizo mayor was the Officer of the Royal Household and Heritage of the Crown of Spain in charge of the trips, the mews and the hunt of the King of Spain. The Office of \\"Caballerizo mayor\\" was one of the main Offices of the Royal Household in charge of the Royal Stables and everything related to the transportation of the Monarch. When the King sorted out from the Royal Palace, the Caballerizo had the main position behind him and the major rang over the other Court Officials. He managed as well the stables, the carriages and the horses. He was assisted by the \\"Primeros Caballerizos\\" (First Equerries) who were nominated by him. He was in charge of the Royal hunt as \\"Montero mayor\\" (Great Hunter) holding, in many cases, the \\"Alcald√≠as\\" (Majorships) of the Spanish royal sites. Papal Master of the Horse The Master of the Horse, Cavallerizzo Maggiore, or Hereditary Superintendent of the Stables of the Palaces, was a hereditary position held by the Marquess Serlupi Crescenzi. The office was a Participating Privy Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape, in the papal household. It was abolished in the reforms of the Papal Curia of 1968. Riksstallm√§stare/√ñverhovstallm√§stare (Sweden) The holder of the title Master of the Horse of the Realm (Riksstallm√§stare) in Sweden was not one of the Great Officers of the Realm, but rather one of the Lesser Officers of the Realm. He was the superintendent of the Royal Stables and of the realm's stud farms. As such he was important in military matters, and often he had a tight connection with the army, and then especially with the army's cavalry units. His duties were partly taken over by the Master of the Horse (√ñverhovstallm√§stare). Equerry (Russia) Konyushy (Russian: –ö–æ–Ω—é—à–∏–π) is literally translated as Master of the Horse or Equerry. Konyushy was a boyar in charge of the stables of Russian rulers. It was a high title at the court of Russian rulers until the 17th century. By the end of the 15th century a special Equerry Office (–∫–æ–Ω—é—à–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏–∫–∞–∑, \\"konyushenny prikaz\\") was introduced, headed by the Konyushy. It was in charge of the Tsar's stables, parade equipage, ceremonies of court ride-offs, and military horse breeding. At one point Boris Godunov was konyushy. The Equerry Office handled a significant amount of Tsar's treasures, related to harness and horse/horseman armor, which were transferred to the Kremlin Armoury in 1736. Koniuszy (Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania) \\"Koniuszy\\" (corresponding to the English-language \\"Equerry\\" or \\"Master of the Horse\\") was a position of nobility known in the Kingdom of Poland from the 11th century, and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 15th. A koniuszy had charge of the stables and herds of a Grand Duke or King; in reality, it was a podkoniuszy (sub- equerry), subordinate to the koniuszy, who had the more direct responsibility. From the 14th to 16th centuries, a \\"koniuszy\\" was a dignitary (dygnitarz) in the Polish Kingdom and in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.  Georgia  In the Kingdom of Georgia, the similar post was known under the name of amilakhvari (amir-akhori, lit.: Prince-Master of the Horse), derived from Arabic. It was a deputy to the commander-in-chief (amir-spasalari) and a member of the royal council. From the 1460s to the Russian annexation of Georgia (1801), the office was hereditary in the Zevdginidze-Amilakhvari family.  Hungary  In the Kingdom of Hungary the master of the horse (Hungarian: f≈ëlov√°szmester) was one of the high officials of the royal household. Asia Similar posts were common in the imperial courts of China and Japan, the royal courts of Korea, and elsewhere in East Asia. The position, known as \\"Sima\\" in Chinese (Âè∏È©¨), literally means \\"Master of the Horse\\". It was first created in the Western Zhou dynasty, with responsibility for military administration and conscription. The position was below the Three Grand Offices and equivalent in status to the six ministers. It was often grouped with four other positions also named with the \\"Si-\\" (control, administer) prefix as the \\"five officials\\" (‰∫îÂÆò). The title was used in different ways in subsequent dynasties. The Han Dynasty awarded \\"Grand Sima\\" as an additional title to high generals, in which context it is often translated into English as \\"Marshal\\". \\"Sima\\" also became a Chinese surname, adopted by descendants of one occupant of the office. The Sima family became emperors in the Jin dynasty, as a result of which \\"Sima\\" ceased to exist as an official position in the central bureaucracy. However, in later dynasties it was used as the name of various relatively minor positions in the military and local administration. However, \\"Sima\\" was also used informally to refer to the Minister of War. The Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya had a Master of the Royal Elephants.

After beginning his career as a print journalist, first in England and then in the United States, he became best known for hosting the television series Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous from 1984 to 1995. The show focused on profiling well-known celebrities and their lavish homes, cars and other materialistic details. Early life Leach was born in London, the son of Violet Victoria (Phillips) and Douglas Thomas Leach, a sales executive. He attended Harrow County School for Boys, 10 miles (16 km) from London, where he edited a school magazine, The Gayton Times, at age 14. At age 15 he became a general news reporter for the Harrow Observer, and earned $6 a week after graduation. Career Leach moved on to the Daily Mail as Britain's youngest \\"Page One\\" reporter at age 18. In 1963, he emigrated to the United States, though he maintained his English accent throughout his life (which would become a trademark of his when he began working in television years later). He wrote for several American newspapers, including New York Daily News, People and Ladies' Home Journal, before launching GO Magazine in 1967 and then became show business editor of The Star.

The band was created by former members of Bill Haley & His Comets who had quit that group in a salary dispute. The name of the group was derived from the first letters of the first names of the founding members: Joey Ambrose (real name Joey d'Ambrosio) (saxophone), Dick Boccelli (under the name \\"Dick Richards\\") (vocals and drums), and Marshall Lytle (string bass). Other members included Chuck Hess (guitar), Jim Buffington (drums), Bob Simpson (Piano), and Max Daffner (drums). Career During the summer of 1955, Lytle, Ambrose and Richards, who were paid on a set salary (as opposed to the other two Comets, pianist Johnny Grande and steel guitar player Billy Williamson, who were considered partners with Haley), requested a pay raise. According to the books Bill Haley by John Swenson and Sound and Glory by John W. Haley and John von Hoelle, their request was denied by either Haley's management or by Haley himself (accounts vary). During that summer, unknown to Haley, the trio recruited a couple of other musicians (Chuck Hess, and Max Daffner) and recorded a few demo tapes - including a version of a Haley composition, \\"Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie\\". This won the group a recording contract with Capitol Records and the group subsequently resigned from the Comets, although according to Swenson they agreed to help train the replacement musicians. The group's first recordings on Capitol came out in late 1955, and the band scored a few minor hits such as \\"Well Now Dig This\\" and \\"Let's All Rock Together.\\" In 1956, the Jodimars became one of the first rock and roll acts to take up residence in Las Vegas showrooms. After the release of their second single, Drummer, Max Daffner was replaced by Jim Buffington. Also, a new member of the group joined on piano, named Bob Simpson. Soon after, they left Capitol and recorded for several smaller labels with no success. By 1958, the band had virtually broken up, though Lytle attempted to revive the group with a series of demo recordings later that year, though he was the only member of the core band to actually take part in the recordings (members of Ricky Nelson's band worked on the recording session instead) and they sat unreleased until 1994. By the 1960s, the Jodimars were only a memory, with Lytle going into real estate, Ambrose becoming a casino pit boss in Las Vegas, and Boccelli/Richards becoming a stage and movie actor. In 1987, the band reunited for a series of concerts in conjunction with a simultaneous reunion of the original members of Bill Haley's Comets. In 1989, Johnny Hale brought the original Comets to the UK as part of his Brean Sands Rock 'n' Roll Weekender. The Jodimars (Joey, Dick and Marshall) were backed by three members of the UK Group The Stargazers (Pete Davenport on lead guitar, Chris Gardner on piano, and Ricky Lee Brawn on drums) in a set which included the Capitol album in its entirety plus a few other later Jodimars' numbers, and was followed by a set as \\"The Original Comets\\". This remains the only billed appearance by the Jodimars since the 1960s. Lytle, Ambrose and Richards went on to tour the world as the Comets alongside pianist Johnny Grande and guitarist Franny Beecher, but included Jodimars songs in each show (most notably \\"Eat Your Heart Out, Annie\\" and \\"Well Now Dig This\\"). Lytle left the Comets in 2009, following the death of Grande in 2006 and Beecher's retirement from touring also in 2006 (Beecher died in February 2014), and continued to perform as a solo act until his death in May 2013, though he, Ambrose and Richards reunited in 2012 to accept the Comets' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. As of the spring of 2014, Ambrose and Richards are the only members of the 1954-55 Comets -- and the Jodimars -- actively performing. In 1963, the Beatles recorded a version of the Jodimars' \\"Clarabella\\" for the Pop Go the Beatles program for BBC Radio, which appeared on the Apple/Parlophone/Capitol album Live at the BBC in 1994, while the song \\"Well Now Dig This\\" inspired the name of the British music magazine, Now Dig This.

A Jodimars cover version of \\"Dim Dim the Lights\\" (which was also a hit for Haley and the Comets) is also known to exist but has never been released. Two compilation albums of Jodimars recordings exist: Well Now Dig This, first released in 1970 then in 1979 and finally in 1989 as a CD by the Bulldog Records label (France), and Let's All Rock Together on the UK Rockstar Records label in 1994, which included the first release of the 1955 and 1958 demo recordings.

There is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist. An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball. However, the original definition of an assist did not include such situations,Hal Bock, Give an assist to NBA , The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 28, 2002. so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter. Only the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal (unlike in other sports, such as ice hockey). A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA, but does in FIBA play (only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made). Point guards tend to get the most assists per game (apg), as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler. Centers tend to get fewer assists, but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting. Being inside the key, the center often has the best angles and the best position for \\"dishes\\" and other short passes in the scoring area. Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in total assists in 1968. A strong center with inside-scoring prowess, such as former NBA center Hakeem Olajuwon, can also be an effective assistor because the defense's double-teaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters. The NBA single-game assist team record is 53, held by the Milwaukee Bucks, on December 26, 1978. The NBA single-game assist individual record is 30, held by Scott Skiles of the Orlando Magic on December 30, 1990. The NBA record for most career assists is held by John Stockton, with 15,806. Stockton also holds the NBA single season assist per game record with 14.5 during the 1989-1990 regular season. The highest career assist per game average in NBA history is held by Magic Johnson, with 11.2 assist per game.

The play was first performed at the Blackfriars Theatre by a company of boy actors known as the Children of the Queen's Revels in early August 1605, and it was printed in September the same year. Eastward Ho! is a citizen or city comedy about Touchstone, a London goldsmith, and his two apprentices, Quicksilver and Golding. The play is highly satirical about social customs in early modern London, and its anti-Scottish satire resulted in a notorious scandal in which King James was offended and the play's authors were imprisoned. Eastward Ho! also references, even parodies, popular plays performed by adult companies such as The Spanish Tragedy, Tamburlaine, and Hamlet.Logan and Smith, p. 146. The play's title alludes to Westward Ho! by Thomas Dekker and John Webster who also wrote Northward Ho! in response that same year.  Characters  * Touchstone, a goldsmith of Cheapside * Mistress Touchstone, his wife, a gentlewoman * Gertude, his elder daughter * Mildred, his younger daughter * Francis Quicksilver, his prodigal apprentice * Golding, his dutiful apprentice * Sindefy, Quicksilver's lover, later employed as Gertrude's maid * Sir Petronel Flash, a 'thirty pound' knight, engaged to Gertrude * Captain Seagull, a ship's captain employed by Petronel to Virginia * Spendall and Scapethrift, adventurers with Captain Seagull * Drawer, of the Blue Tavern in Billingsgate * Security, an elderly usurer; bawd to Quicksilver * Winifred, Security's young wife * Bramble, a lawyer * Scrivener * Poldavy, a tailor * Bettrice, a lady's maid * Mistress Fond and Mistress Gazer, city women * Coachman, to Gertrude * Hamlet, footman to Gertrude * Potkin, a tankard bearer * First Gentleman and Second Gentleman, at the Isle of Dogs * Wolf, the keeper of the Counter, a prison * Slitgut, a butcher's apprentice * Holdfast, a prison guard * Friend, of the prisoners * First Prisoner, Second Prisoner (Toby) * Page, Messenger, Constable, and Officers  Synopsis  = Act 1 = William Touchstone, a London goldsmith, chastises his apprentice Francis ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù Quicksilver for his laziness and prodigality. Concerned with his reputation, he tells Quicksilver to consider his actions with the catchphrase, \\"Work upon that now!\\" (1.1.10-1). Touchstone also warns Quicksilver against dishonest business and bad company, but Quicksilver remains dismissive and defensive about his way of life. Contrastingly, Touchstone‚Äôs second apprentice, Golding, is industrious and temperate. Touchstone expresses his great admiration for Golding‚Äôs uprightness and hopes that Golding will marry Mildred, his mild and modest daughter. Touchstone's second daughter, Gertrude, is engaged to the fraudulent Sir Petronel Flash, a knight who possesses a title but is bankrupt. Unlike her sister, Gertrude is vain and lascivious, preoccupied with opulent fashion and advancing her social status by marrying Petronel. After reluctantly granting Gertude‚Äôs inheritance, Touchstone heartily gives Golding permission to marry Mildred. Anticipating a successful match, Touchstone praises the engaged couple for their virtues. = Act 2 = The morning after Gertude and Petronel‚Äôs costly wedding, Touchstone breaks Quicksilver's apprenticeship and dismisses him for his shameful gluttony and drunkenness. Unperturbed, Quicksilver mocks Touchstone and asserts that he will spend his new freedom going ‚Äúeastward ho!‚Äù (2.1.100-2). Touchstone promotes his new son-in-law, Golding, to a member of the guild. Quicksilver meets with Security, an old usurer and pander who is married to a young woman named Winifred. Quicksilver devises how he will climb the social ladder and get wealthy without inconvenience or labor. Petronel arrives and expresses his desire to leave London, especially since he cannot tolerate Gertrude or her expensive tastes. He confesses that ‚Äúall the castles I have are built with air‚Äù (2.3.7). Quicksilver persuades Petronel to use Gertrude's dowry to fund their voyage to Virginia. = Act 3 = Touchstone arrives with Golding and Mildred who are now married. Gertrude pretentiously flaunts her higher rank and disdains her family's lower social status. Once Gertrude unsuspectingly signs away her dowry, Petronel makes hasty preparations to sail to Virginia. Before their departure, Quicksilver and Petronel tell old Security to distract the lawyer Mr. Bramble so they can secretly take Bramble‚Äôs wife on the voyage. Instead, Quicksilver disguises Winifred and brings her on the ship, fooling Security. Accompanied by Captain Seagull, Petronel and his fellow adventurers set sail for Virginia. They revel in the promise of abundant gold in Virginia and spend the night drinking while Petronel and Quicksilver conceal Winifred‚Äôs identity from Bramble and Security. Their drunken dancing ends, however, when a storm hits their ship. = Act 4 = In the confusion of the storm, Security sees Winifred escape with Petronel in a lifeboat, suspecting that she has cheated on him. Separated from Quicksilver and Petronel, Security washes ashore on Cuckold‚Äôs Haven where he stays in a nearby tavern. Winifred also arrives at the tavern along with Drawer, one of the voyagers. Shipwrecked and disoriented, Quicksilver and Petronel lament their unfortunate condition. Two passing gentlemen tell them they have arrived on the Isle of Dogs, a northern peninsula in the Thames. Quicksilver tells Petronel and Captain Seagull that he will use his goldsmithing skills to create counterfeit money. Back in the tavern, Winifred lies to Security to cover up her affair with Petronel. Nearby in London, Golding has been promoted to Master Deputy Alderman. He reports the shipwrecked voyagers have been arrested at Billingsgate for their crimes. Meanwhile, as a result of Petronel‚Äôs deception, Gertrude sells her opulent clothes and pities her misfortune. Sympathetic towards Gertrude‚Äôs situation, Mistress Touchstone advises her daughter to seek Mildred‚Äôs help. = Act 5 = Brought before Golding and Touchstone, Petronel and Quicksilver admit their guilt in the charges brought against them, including Petronel‚Äôs dishonest marriage, the dowry deception, and Quicksilver‚Äôs thievery. Touchstone is appalled and refuses to have mercy on the voyagers. Quicksilver sings a song about his repentance of his schemes and dishonesty, whose change in character and denouncement of vice moves Touchstone to amazement. Golding releases the criminals, including Security, who still laments his cuckoldry. Touchstone reinstates Quicksilver as his apprentice and Petronel as his son-in-law, covering the loss of their possessions and wealth. Gertrude reconciles with Petronel and the play ends happily.  Authorship and Publication  Scholars have attempted to determine the respective contributions of the three authors but have not reached a full consensus.Logan, Terence P., and Denzell S. Smith, eds. The New Intellectuals: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama. Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1977; pp. 91, 152‚Äì3, 223. Earlier scholars attributed act 1 to Marston, acts 2-3 to Chapman, and act 5 to Jonson. More recently, however, scholars have suggested that the play's authorship was more collaborative, since numerous passages Eastward Ho! evidence more than one author's writing style.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 256. In early September 1605, William Aspley and Thomas Thorp entered Eastward Ho! into the Stationers' Register. The title page features all three authors, Chapman, Jonson, and Martson; the playing company who premiered the work, the Children of the Queen's Revels; and the playhouse, Blackfriars Theatre, where the play was first staged. Later in December 1605 and March 1606, George Eld printed more quartos issued by AspleyChambers, E. K. The Elizabethan Stage. 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 254. to meet the high demands for the play. In total, three more print editions of Eastward Ho! were issued within three months of its first publication. The popularity of the play and the looming possibility of censorship may have quickened the publication process. The surviving editions show evidence of deleted lines, missing passages, and altered passages. The censorship may have been issued by the Master of Revels, or his deputy, George Buc, who was also involved in play licensing until 1610. The printed text of 1605 does not represent the full and offensive stage production of that year, though critics have disagreed as to whether the hostile official reaction was provoked more by the stage version or by the text.Logan and Smith, pp. 146, 218.  Scandal  = Anti-Scottish Satire = The following passages in Eastward Ho! exemplify the Anti-Scottish sentiment that likely offended Scottish-born King James I: In Act 1, when Sir Petronel's knighthood is questioned, Mistress Touchstone says, \\"Yes, that he is a knight! I know where he had money to pay the gentlemen ushers and heralds their fees. Ay, that he is a knight!\\" (1.2.81-2). Mistress Touchstone attributes Sir Pentronel's legitimacy to his purchased title. This line probably satirizes \\"King James's lavish grants of knighthood.\\" While getting her dress tailored, Gertrude remarks, \\"Tailor Poldavy, prithee, fit it, fit it: is this a right Scot? Does it clip close, and bear up round?\\" (1.2.39-40). This remark possibly references the perception that Scots accompanying King James invaded the English Court. In Act 2, Quicksilver remarks, \\"[Gertrude] could have been made a lady by a Scotch knight, and never ha' married him\\" (2.3.68-9). This line references a practice in Scotland where \\"notorious cohabitation\\" is accepted as \\"matrimonial engagement without formal ceremony.\\" In Act 3, Captain Seagull describes Virginia, the new country that is their destination. While explaining the other inhabitants in the new country, Seagull hints that he wishes for all of the King's Scotsmen to leave England: > \\"And you shall live freely there... with only a few industrious Scots, > perhaps, who indeed are dispers'd over the face of the whole earth. But, as > for them, there are no greater friends to Englishmen and England, when they > are out on't, in the world, than they are. And, for my part, I would a > hundred thousand of 'em were there, for we are all one countrymen now, ye > know; and we should find ten times more comfort of them there than we do > here.\\" (3.3.29-35). These lines particularly angered Sir James Murray and were consequently omitted from the first quarto publication. In Act 4, when Quicksilver inquires about his whereabouts, he meets the First Gentleman, who has a Scots accent. The First Gentlemen remarks, \\"I ken [Sir Petronel] well; he is one of my thirty-pound knights\\" (4.1.140). Like the reference in Act 1, this line mocks King James's selling of knighthoods and granting titles to fellow Scots. = Imprisonment = After the play's first performances, Jonson and Chapman were imprisoned for offending King James I with satirical Scottish references. In August 1605, when the play premiered, King James I was traveling to Oxford with courtiers including the Lord Chamberlain \\"whose permission should have been obtained before the comedy was performed.\\" Staging boldly satirical plays without licence had been done before by playing companies, but this instance seems to have gone too far and caused a significant scandal. Jonson later recounted to William Drummond of Hawthornden that he \\"was delated by Sir James Murray to the king for writing something against the Scots in a play, Eastward Ho, and voluntary imprisoned himself with Chapman and Marston who had written it amongst them. The report was that they should then had their ears cut and noses.\\"Herford, C. H., and Percy Simpson, eds. Ben Jonson: The Complete Works. 11 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1925‚Äì54; Vol. 1, p. 143. Marston was absent, and was not imprisoned with Chapman and Jonson. He may have avoided arrest because of his financial investment in the playing company. = Release from Prison = Between late August and early September, Jonson and Chapman wrote urgent letters to friends, petitioning for their intervention.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 255. Among the names addressed in their letters were Earl of Suffolk, Lord Aubigny (the King's cousin Esm√© Stuart), Earl of Pembroke, the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Salisbury (Robert Cecil), and even King James himself. Chapman's personal correspondences and commendatory poem in the first edition of Jonson's Sejanus (1605) suggest that the Earl of Suffolk was influential in obtaining their release in November 1605. Additionally, Lord Aubigny may have also smoothed the matter through a large financial transaction from Robert Cecil to Sir James Murray, a Scottish knight and favorite courtier of the King, who had been particularly offended at the play's Scottish satire. After his release from prison, Ben Jonson threw a banquet for his friends in celebration.  Stage History  Eastward Ho! was banned from the stage until 1614, when it was revived in a court production by the Lady Elizabeth's Men. Later, in 1685, Nahum Tate revised Eastward Ho! to fit the fashions of Restoration theatre. After David Garrick's 1751 production in London and Charlotte Lennox's 1775 adaption, the play was infrequently performed through the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, the play was produced on radio adaptions and university stages, but remained neglected on professional stages. Only three professional productions between 1951 and 1983 were performed by Bernard Miles‚Äô original Mermaid Theatre. The Royal Shakespeare Company revived Eastward Ho! in a production series which featured four other Jacobean plays in 2002. Directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace, the play was performed at the Swan Theatre in 2002 with a positive critical reception. The play was also produced in 2006 by the American Shakespeare Center in the Blackfriar's Playhouse in Staunton, Virginia.

Education Bruce was educated at Winchester College and New College, Oxford, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics. Career In 1939 he joined the British Army, commissioned with the rank of Lieutenant in the Welsh Guards; he would eventually reach the rank of Captain, after having served in various staff positions with XII Corps, the 21st Army Group, and XXX Corps during and after World War II. He joined the J. Arthur Rank Organisation in 1947, working there for two years before moving to the British Broadcasting Corporation, where he worked between 1949 and 1956. In 1970, he became Minister of State for the Department of Health and Social Security; in 1974, he was appointed to the Privy Council and became a Minister without Portfolio.

As of December 2017, The Weis family owns 65% of the company stock which has been listed on NYSE since 1965. History Map of Weis stores (as of 2011). Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as \\"revolutionary\\", as it did not operate on credit‚Äîsales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks‚Äîand they also helped lower prices by up to 25%. The second Weis store opened in 1915 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg would remain an important market for Weis, helping to anchor the central Pennsylvania region that Weis would dominate for decades. A Weis supermarket in Mifflintown, Pennsylvania. The Weis brothers expanded their chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania. Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. As the supermarket industry shifted to larger, self-service stores, Weis adapted the format of its stores. The company closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets, with 35 stores by 1955. In newspaper ads of the 1940s, Weis referred to its stores first as Weis Super Markets,Advertisement, Harrisburg Telegraph, 6 March 1941 then Weis Self- Service Markets,Advertisement, Harrisburg Telegraph, 22 August 1946 and finally Weis Markets.Advertisement, The Express (Lock Haven, Pennsylvania), 9 December 1949 In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis expanded its reach, first to York and then Lancaster by 1960. Weis expanded to Maryland in July 1967, opening its first non-Pennsylvania store in Hagerstown,\\"Weis Markets Sales, Earnings Show Increases,\\" The News (Frederick, Maryland), 18 Jul 1967 followed by a store in Frederick in August\\"Weis Markets Opens 2d Store in Maryland,\\" Pottstown Mercury, 23 Aug 1967. Its first store in the Wilkes-Barre area opened in 1967.\\"To Build Market,\\" The News (Frederick, Maryland), 24 Oct 1967) In November 1967, the company purchased the five-store Albany Public Markets chain based in Albany, New York, in an all-cash transaction. It operated Albany Public Markets as a subsidiary, keeping the company's management team intact.\\"Weis Buys N.Y. Chain,\\" The Express (Lock Haven, Pennsylvania), 8 Nov 1967) Weis closed its Albany Public Markets chain in October 1986, leasing the nine stores to Grand Union. Weis also expanded to western Pennsylvania, opening stores as far west as Altoona, Everett, and Philipsburg, and expanded throughout northeastern Pennsylvania. The company purchased two regional chains in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley region: Mr. Z's, a 14-store chain of IGA supermarkets, in 1992,\\"Weis Markets to Buy IGA Stores,\\" Standard-Speaker (Hazleton, Pennsylvania), 28 November 1992 and King's, a six-store chain based in Hamburg, in 1994.\\"Weis Markets Inc. to Buy King's Supermarkets,\\" Gettysburg Times, 29 June 1994 Mr. Z's and King's were operated under separate banners for years before all stores were re-branded as Weis. Weis's expansion into the Baltimore, Maryland market was successful, but its expansions into the Washington, D.C. market were less successful. Weis opened stores in suburban Washington, D.C. and northern Virginia before retreating from that market, first closing most of its stores in Montgomery County, Maryland, and finally closing all stores in Virginia. Weis also expanded into northern New Jersey, beginning with a store opened in Newton in 1992. In 2000, another store opened in Flanders; it closed in 2002, two years after its opening. Weis re-entered Flanders in 2014, in a former A&P; store adjacent to the location of its first Flanders store. On July 19 2018 Weis Markets opened a second store in Morris County NJ in the town of Randolph (where a former A&P; used to operate before A&P;'s bankruptcy in 2015). In 2009, Weis expanded into the Southern Tier of New York with the acquisition of the 11-store Giant Markets chain. Weis closed one former Giant Market in Binghamton in 2012, along with two others in 2014. Eight former Giant Markets continue to operate. A Weis supermarket in Fredericksburg, Virginia, formerly a Food Lion. Eastern expansion continued in 2012 as Weis acquired three former Genuardi's stores from Safeway, in the Philadelphia suburbs of Conshohocken, Doylestown and Norristown, on June 16. A former Superfresh store in Towson, Maryland, opened as a Weis in 2012. Weis entered central New Jersey with the purchase of a former Pathmark store in Hillsborough in August 2013. In November 2013, Weis opened its closest store to Philadelphia after acquiring a former Pathmark store in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. In July 2015, Weis purchased the location and assets of Nell's Shur-fine Market from C&S; Wholesale Grocers in Penn Township, York County, Pennsylvania and followed that up in October 2016 with the purchase of a second Nell's location in East Berlin, Pennsylvania. In May 2016, Weis Markets announced the purchase of five stores from Mars in Baltimore County, Maryland, after that chain announced it was closing all its stores. In July 2016, it was announced that Weis Markets entered into a purchase agreement with Ahold and Delhaize Group for 38 Food Lion locations in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the Federal Trade Commission for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger. On October 5, 2016, Weis announced the purchase of Nell's Shur-fine Market in East Berlin, PA from C&S; Wholesale Grocers. The company completed the acquisition and conversion of the 44 stores in early November 2016. On March 9, 2017, Weis Markets opened a store in Hampden Township, Pennsylvania, that features a pub, ice cream parlor, expanded takeout food selection, a drive-thru pharmacy, and a beer cafe selling 900 varieties of beer and 500 varieties of wine. In late September 2019, Weis acquired two Thomas' Food Market stores, one in Dallas, Pennsylvania and another in Shavertown, Pennsylvania, reopening the Dallas location under the Weis banner and closing the Shavertown location. =Robert and Jonathan Weis= Robert F. Weis, the son of founder Harry Weis, joined the company in 1946 after serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Early in his career, he worked in various positions including operations, distribution, marketing, procurement, human resources, real estate, and store construction. Ultimately, Weis would oversee the company's finances, real estate, and store construction while working with his cousin Sigfried Weis, who became company president after the death of Harry Weis in 1962. When Sigfried Weis retired in 1994, Robert Weis became company chairman, a position he held until the spring of 2015 when he became chairman emeritus. Weis's son Jonathan, who was CEO at the time, succeeded him as chairman. Robert Weis died on October 19, 2015. =Legal case= The Weis supermarket located in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in Altoona, Pennsylvania, was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the \\"public forum doctrine.\\" The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the \\"shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district\\" of a city.Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308 (1968). At the time of the picketing, the Weis store was located in Logan Valley Mall, the Park Hills Plaza was not built until the mid-1970s, at which time Weis moved across U.S. Route 220 to its current location. Banners In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Lehigh Valley and the Poconos, respectively, and were acquired in 1993 (Mr.Z's) and 1994 (King's). Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced. In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg. In 2011, it converted its three Scot's Lo- Cost stores, a warehouse store concept, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall, and Coal Township, to the Weis banner. Weis operates some stores as Save-a-Lot under license from SuperValu. At one time, the company operated a few stores as Big-Top Market, but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner. Competition Weis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, Walmart and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. Giant (Carlisle), a supermarket chain owned by Ahold, began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building large stores with expanded selections. Giant has remained the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania. Weis also faces tough competition in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, from Stauffer's of Kissel Hill. In Maryland, Weis competes with Walmart, Acme, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Safeway, ShopRite and Giant (Landover). In New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes ShopRite, Stop & Shop and Acme. In New York, Weis's competition includes Price Chopper and Wegmans. In 2011, it sold or closed its remaining Superpetz units, a move that is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.

Baldwin, was an American industrial designer and writer. Baldwin was a student of Buckminster Fuller; Baldwin's work was inspired by Fuller's principles and, in the case of some of Baldwin's published writings, he popularized and interpreted Fuller's ideas and achievements. In his own right, Baldwin was a figure in American designers' efforts to incorporate solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. In his career, being a fabricator was as important as being a designer. Baldwin is noted as the inventor of the \\"Pillow Dome\\", a design that combines Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome with panels of inflated ETFE plastic panels.  Life and work  J. Baldwin was born the son of an engineer. Baldwin has said that, at 18, he heard Buckminster Fuller speak for 14 hours non-stop. This was in 1951 at the University of Michigan, where Baldwin had enrolled to learn automobile design because a friend of his had been killed in a car accident that Baldwin attributed to bad design. He worked with Fuller prior to graduation from U. of M. in 1955. During his student years, Baldwin worked (in a unique job sharing role) in an auto factory assembly line. He went on to do graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley.Baldwin, J. & Brand, Stewart (1978) Soft- Tech. Penguin Books, p.4 . Baldwin remained a friend of Buckminster Fuller, and reflected that \\"By example, he encouraged me to think for myself comprehensively, to be disciplined, to work for the good of everyone, and to have a good time doing it.\\"Baldwin, J. (1997) BuckyWorks: Buckminster Fuller's Ideas for Today. John Wiley & Sons, p. xi. As a young designer in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Baldwin designed advanced camping equipment with Bill Moss Associates. Thereafter, he taught simultaneously at San Francisco State College (now called San Francisco State University), San Francisco Art Institute, and the Oakland campus of California College of Arts & Crafts for about six years. The period 1968-69 found him both a visiting lecturer at Southern Illinois University and the design editor of the innovative Whole Earth Catalog. The Catalog came out in many editions between 1968 and 1998, and Baldwin continued to edit and write for both the Catalog and an offshoot publication, CoEvolution Quarterly, later renamed Whole Earth Review. In the early 1970s, Baldwin taught at Pacific High School. Baldwin was at the center of experimentation with geodesic domes, an unconventional building-design approach ‚Äì explored by Fuller ‚Äì that maximizes strength and covered area in relation to materials used. He also dove enthusiastically into the application of renewable energy sources in homes and in food-production facilities, working with Integrated Life Support Systems Laboratories (ILS, in New Mexico) and with Dr. John Todd and the other New Alchemists involved with \\"The Ark\\" project. Baldwin's initial involvement with solar energy was during that very experimental, ad-lib phase when much was moving from principles or theory into actual development. In the 1970s, at ILS, he was the co-developer of what has been touted as the world's first building to be heated and otherwise powered by solar and wind power exclusively. At Prince Edward Island, Jay Baldwin perfected his greenhouse design: successfully maintaining Banana trees. He used several water tanks filled with tilapia, as a source of natural fertilizer for his hydroponics system. His greenhouse includes a volume of compost for the production of heat, which is recirculated by ceiling fans. All of these are the staples for the components of modern greenhouse construction design.Bioshelter Arks (2018), The New Alchemy Institute. Baldwin referred to his own rural home as \\"a three-dimensional sketchpad\\".Danitz, Brian & Zelov, Chris (directors); Cousineau, Phil (writer) (1994). Ecological Design: Inventing the Future (documentary film) . During the first Jerry Brown administration, Baldwin worked in the California Office of Appropriate Technology. Since the 1970s, Baldwin has continued to work as a designer in association with numerous organizations and projects. He organized for himself a mobile design studio and machine workshop (in a van pulling an Airstream trailer) to drive to various projects across America. With the ears of a wider audience in the 1980s, Baldwin developed an incisive critique of the American automobile industry, which he viewed as over-focused on superficial marketing concerns and farcically under-concerned with real innovation and improvement. He was also a constructive critic of the emerging industries manufacturing \\"soft technology\\" equipment like wind turbines. In the late 1990s, he worked with the Rocky Mountain Institute of Snowmass, Colorado in the research, design, and development of the ultralight, ultra-efficient \\"Hypercar\\" ‚Äî a prototype by way of which independent designers hope to show the way for the world's auto manufacturers. With conceptual development having begun in 1991, the current version of the Hypercar uses a small generator to power an electric motor in each wheel. Given his long-term role as a \\"technology\\" editor, something should be mentioned about the scope of Baldwin's focus on technology. His interests remained broader than that represented in the shifting media and popular focus of the mid 1980s and later, which inclined to highlight the micro chip and electronic devices based on it. Baldwin has continued to point out the value of (and need for evaluation of) technologies within a larger perimeter. Certainly shelter and transportation technologies have always interested him. So have tools, and whether a device or tool or process was freshly innovative or age-old in concept, if it enabled a person to \\"do the job\\" with wood, metal, fiberglass panels, soil, trees, or whatever, it remained worthy of Baldwin's attention. Whereas the personal computer often (though not necessarily) inclines its operator toward imagination, almost in the sense of , Baldwin has remained equally interested in , in application. And while he has never ceased to be interested in the products of the factory, Baldwin has always wanted to empower individuals and small teams of people to accomplish something. Jay is seen here removing a lower perimeter wall section of the Dymaxion House, demonstrating a B. Fuller principle that any part of the Dymaxion Dwelling Machine can be manipulated by a single person. Baldwin, as one of the notable designer technologists whose cross-disciplinary approaches have opened new territory, was featured in the 1994 documentary film Ecological Design: Inventing the Future. The film viewed these designers as \\"outlaws\\" whose careers have necessarily developed \\"outside the box\\" of their time, largely unsupported by mainstream industry and often beyond the pale of mainstream academia, as well. Baldwin invented a permanent, transparent, insulated geodesic dome ‚Äî using a framework of aluminum tubing, covered with argon-filled laminated vinyl sheet \\"pillows\\" ‚Äî which he dubbed the \\"Pillow Dome\\", said to have withstood 135-mph winds and thirty inches of snow. The structure weighed just one-half pound per square foot of floor space. For a variety of reasons including durability and toxicity concerns from vinyl chloride vapor emitted by vinyl sheeting, Baldwin later recommended the use of ETFE film; ETFE had further advantages including transparency and ease of keeping the surface clean, but its ultraviolet transparency reduces its suitability for occupied structures. Baldwin intentionally did not patent his invention. The basic approach has since been applied in large-scale applications such as the Eden Project in Cornwall, England. Baldwin continued to practice design (as exemplified in the unique and aerodynamic 'mobile-room' Quick-Up camper he has put on the market) and to teach design at the college level up until 2016. Between the early 1990s and 2016 he taught at Sonoma State University, San Francisco Institute of Architecture, and at California College of Arts & Crafts. Baldwin died on March 2, 2018 at the age of 84.

Early life Ackner was the son of a Jewish dentist, Dr Conrad Ackner, from Vienna, who came to Britain before the First World War. He was educated at Highgate School, before attending university at Clare College, Cambridge, where he read economics and law, and where he was later an honorary fellow. During the Second World War, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery, although a twisted foot kept him out of active service and he was transferred to the Admiralty's naval law branch. Legal and judicial career Ackner was called to the bar by the Middle Temple in 1945, practising mainly commercial law. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1961, a bencher of Middle Temple in 1965 and was later treasurer in 1984. He came to public notice acting for victims of thalidomide in the late 1960s in their action for damages against the manufacturer of the drug, Distillers, which was settled before trial, and as counsel for the families of the victims at the public inquiry into the Aberfan disaster in 1967, in which he condemned the \\"callous indifference, incompetence, ignorance and inertia\\" in the National Coal Board. Ackner proved to be an inspired choice and he remains a local hero in Aberfan, where a bench in the memorial garden bears a plaque in his memory. He subsequently appeared in a number of very public libel actions, including acting for John Bloom, International Herald Tribune, Svetlana Alliluyeva (Joseph Stalin's daughter) and Lee Kwan Yew (Prime Minister of Singapore) and The Spectator. He was elected to the Bar Council in 1957, was treasurer in 1964, vice-chairman in 1966, and chairman in 1968. He was appointed Recorder of Swindon in 1962, and became an Appellate Judge of Jersey and Guernsey in 1967, serving in both offices until he was appointed a High Court Judge of the Queen's Bench in 1971, receiving the customary knighthood. He became a judge of the Commercial Court in 1973, and was promoted to become a Lord Justice of Appeal and was appointed to the Privy Council in 1980. Three years later, in 1983, he became an honorary fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. On 30 January 1986, he was appointed Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and was made a life peer as Baron Ackner, of Sutton in the County of West Sussex. He joined in the majority in the House of Lords in 1987 in the 3:2 judgment imposing an injunction to prevent The Guardian, The Observer and The Sunday Times newspapers publishing extracts from Peter Wright's book, Spycatcher, saying that failing to impose an injunction would be a \\"charter for traitors\\". He also joined in decisions banning broadcasts by the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Sinn F√©in and ruled in the R v R case that a man could be convicted of the rape of his wife (overturning a century of judicial precedent). Retirement He retired as a Law Lord in 1992 but continued to attend the Lords as a crossbencher. He remained active in Bar politics, supporting the traditional division of the legal profession in the UK and opposing the extension of rights of audience to solicitors.

The first store opened in Dunellen, New Jersey in 1967, and has since then grown into a chain. Several stores include pharmacies, gas stations, and liquor departments. The size of the stores range from smaller corner-type shops to larger convenience stores. Many stores are located in urban areas and most are open 24 hours a day. Former Stores with pharmacies tended to offer a pharmacy-like selection of health products and aids. Stores have PNC Bank ATMs inside. Initially, QuickChek stores were mini-supermarkets with mostly grocery items, snack foods, delis, candy, milk, bread, soda, medicated products, some prepackaged meats, and a small produce area. During the 1990s the stores began to offer fuel as well and gradually changed focus on snack foods, drinks, ready to eat foods, and gas stations. Still, QuickChek stores typically offer moderate amounts of basic groceries such as bread, milk, and a few grocery items, frozen dinners, as well as soft drinks, bottled water, ready to eat sandwiches, and a wide selection of snack foods. They also serve coffee, frozen beverages (Quick Freeze), and sandwiches. Some stores also serve milkshakes and frozen cappuccinos. Like most convenience stores, QuickChek sells cigarettes and other tobacco products, along with lottery tickets. Most also sell fuel as well which has become the main draw to these stores. QuickChek also has its own assortment of baked goods. Some of the baked goods are baked fresh in the store.

Summary of his life Whipple circa 1860 Born in Adams, New York, he was raised in the Presbyterian church but became an Episcopalian through the influence of his grandparents and his wife, Cornelia, whom he married in 1842. Whipple attended Oberlin College from 1838‚Äì1839 and worked in his father's business until he was admitted to holy orders in 1848. After ordination Whipple served parishes in Rome, New York and Chicago, where he gained a reputation for his service to poor immigrant groups. His Chicago ministry drew him to the attention of the newly formed Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota which elected him its first bishop in 1859. He served until his death in 1901. Although concerned with establishing his denomination in the new state of Minnesota, Whipple soon began to champion the cause of Native American groups in the state against what he saw as an abusive and corrupt Federal policy towards Indians. He is best known for his clemency pleas in favor of a group of Dakota or Sioux who fought against the United States government in the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 in the area around New Ulm, Minnesota. On December 26, 1862, the largest mass execution in U.S. history occurred in Mankato following the war's end. Thirty-eight Dakota Amerindians were hanged for participation in the conflict. A total of 303 were sentenced to be hanged but President Lincoln pardoned 265 at Whipple's urging. Lincoln's intervention was not popular at the time. Two commemorative statues are located on the site of the hangings (now home to the Blue Earth County Library and Reconciliation Park). He was referred to as \\"Straight Tongue\\" by Dakota Indians because of his honesty in dealing with them. Whipple is memorialized by the Bishop Whipple Federal Building in Fort Snelling, Minnesota, which houses, among other things, offices for members of Minnesota's congressional delegation. His name is also found on a building on the campus of Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota called Bishop Whipple Hall, a building which was originally a prep school built by Episcopalians but which was purchased by Norwegian Lutherans in 1891 as the main building of their newly founded Concordia College. Shattuck School (now coordinated with St. Mary's Hall and St. James School as Shattuck-St. Mary's School, formerly The Bishop Whipple Schools: Shattuck, St. Mary's, St. James) is a prominent Episcopal boarding preparatory school in Faribault, Minnesota. Bishop Whipple was a founder of these schools, which descended from his Seabury Divinity School ‚Äî later Seabury-Western Theological Seminary (now Bexley Seabury Seminary), which eventually moved to the Chicago area.Seabury-Western Theological Seminary The main boy's dormitory at Shattuck is called Whipple Hall. He is buried beneath the altar of the Cathedral of Our Merciful Saviour in Faribault, Minnesota. Early life Henry Benjamin Whipple was born on February 15, 1822 in Adams, New York. He was educated at a private boarding school in Clinton, New York, and at Jefferson County Institute in Watertown, New York. In 1839, he attended Oberlin Collegiate Institute, but his health failed and his physician recommended an active business life. Career Bishop Whipple late in life After several years working for his father, a country merchant, Whipple began studying for the ministry in the Episcopal Church. He was ordained a deacon in August 1849, became rector of Zion Church in Rome, New York, in November 1849, and was ordained priest in 1850. Whipple served as rector of Zion Church from 1849‚Äì1857, becoming known both for the size and wealth of his parish and for his work among the poor. In 1857, Whipple helped organize and became the first rector of the Church of the Holy Communion, on Chicago's South Side, the first free church in the city. He drew his parishioners from \\"the highways and the hedges\\" - clerks, laborers, railroad men, travelers, and derelicts - sought converts among the city's Swedish population, and regularly officiated in a Chicago prison. On June 30, 1859, Whipple was elected the first Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, an office he held until his death more than forty years later. He was consecrated bishop on October 13, 1859 at St. James Episcopal Church during the General Convention in Richmond by bishops Jackson Kemper, Leonidas Polk and William H. DeLancey, with George Burgess delivering the sermon.George Burgess, The Love of Zion (Cincinnati, Gazette Company Print at request of the deputation from Minnesota, 1859) In December of that year, Whipple made his first visitation of his diocese, including the Ojibwe missions of E. Steele Peake and John Johnson Enmegahbowh. In the spring of 1860 he moved his family to Faribault, establishing it as the see of the diocese. During his episcopate, Whipple guided the development of the Episcopal Church in Minnesota from a few missionary parishes to a flourishing and prosperous diocese. For many years, especially during the first two decades of his episcopate, he made regular missionary sojourns by wagon or coach through the rural areas of the state, often in mid-winter, preaching in cabins, school houses, stores, saloons, and Indian villages. Until the diocese was financially secure, he pledged himself to personally support several of its missionary clergy and assumed many other financial obligations of the church. He unified a diocese that at the time of his election was divided into two quarreling factions. In 1860, Whipple incorporated the Bishop Seabury Mission in Faribault, building it upon the foundations laid by James Lloyd Breck and Solon W. Manny, who in 1858 had founded a divinity school and school for boys and girls. With the help of gifts from eastern donors, the mission developed into three separate but closely connected schools: Seabury Divinity School, Shattuck School for boys, and St. Mary's Hall for the education of daughters of the clergy. Whipple also helped found the Breck School in Wilder, Minnesota, to educate the children of farmers. Advocate for Native Americans Whipple was best known outside of Minnesota for his dedication to the welfare of the American Indians and for his missionary work among Dakota and Ojibwe in Minnesota. He returned from his first visitation of his diocese with a firm commitment to establish Indian missions and reform of the United States Indian system. Whipple regularly included Indian villages on his visitations, built up the Episcopal mission to the Ojibwe based at the White Earth Reservation, and appealed for support of Indian missions by lectures throughout the United States and in Europe. In the early years of his episcopate, Whipple's espousal of Indian reform and commitment to Indian missions earned him the enmity of many whites who hated Indians, and led some of his fellow bishops to look upon him as a fanatic. His attitude was denounced most bitterly after Minnesota's Dakota Conflict of 1862, when, in appeals to President Lincoln and through the press, Whipple opposed wholesale executions and extermination or deportation of the Dakota. Whipple even criticized his distant cousin and former Minnesota governor, Colonel Henry Sibley in such matters. Later episcopate Memorial service program for Whipple Although a high churchman in doctrine, Whipple preached tolerance of all views which fell within the scope of the church's basic teachings. Urging that the church's task was to \\"preach Christ crucified\\" and that sectarian quarrels hindered this mission, Whipple pleaded for unity among all branches of the Episcopal and Anglican communions, and for harmonious relations among members of all Christian denominations. Both in Chicago and in Minnesota, Whipple worked closely with ministers and communicants of the national Swedish church. His interest in the church's missionary efforts was reflected in his presidency of the Western Church Building Society (1880‚Äì1893), service on several committees and commissions of the General Convention concerned with missionary affairs, and special missions to Cuba and to Puerto Rico. From the late 1870s until his death, Whipple's health compelled him to spend the winter months each year at his winter home in Maitland, Florida, where he held missionary services and in 1880 built the Carpenter Gothic Church of the Good Shepherd on land which he had purchased. The church was consecrated on March 17, 1883, and Whipple conducted regular services there each winter for the rest of his life.The Church of the Good Shepherd Henry B. Whipple died on September 16, 1901, having survived his coadjutor Mahlon Norris Gilbert. Family Henry and Evangeline Whipple Whipple married Cornelia Wright, daughter of Benjamin and Sarah Wright of Adams, New York in 1842. They had six children. Cornelia Whipple died in 1890 from injuries suffered in a railroad accident. In 1896 Whipple married Evangeline Marrs Simpson, widow of industrialist Michael Hodge Simpson. His son, John Hall Whipple, was mysteriously killed in 1878. An anonymous writer confessed to the murder, alleging that he killed the bishop's son to avenge a wrong. State Senator David Wager (1804‚Äì1870) was his uncle; and United States Army General Henry Halleck (1815‚Äì1872) was his first cousin. Honors Whipple was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1894.

Views Rozanov tried to reconcile Christian teachings with ideas of healthy sex and family life, though as his adversary Nikolai Berdyaev put it, \\"to set up sex in opposition to the Word\\". Because of references to the phallus in Rozanov's writings, Klaus von Beyme called him the Rasputin of the Russian intelligentsia.Klaus von Beyme, Politische Theorien im Zeitalter der Ideologien, Wiesbaden 2002, pp. 604-05 Rozanov's mature works are personal diaries containing intimate thoughts, impromptu lines, unfinished maxims, vivid aphorisms, reminiscences, and short essays. These works, in which he thus attempted to recreate the intonations of speech, form a loosely connected trilogy, comprising Solitaria (1911) and the two volumes of Fallen Leaves (1913 and 1915). Rozanov frequently referred to himself as Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \\"Underground Man\\" and proclaimed his right to espouse contrary opinions at the same time. He first attracted attention in the 1890s when he published political sketches in the conservative newspaper Novoye Vremya (\\"New Time\\"), owned and run by Aleksey Suvorin. Rozanov's comments, always paradoxical and sparking controversy, led him into clashes with the Tsarist government and with radicals such as Lenin. For example, Rozanov readily passed from criticism of Russian Orthodoxy, and even of what he saw as the Christian preoccupation with death, to fervent praise of Christian faith, from praise of Judaism to unabashed anti-Semitism, and from acceptance of homosexuality as yet another side of human nature to vitriolic accusations that Gogol and some other writers had been latent homosexuals. He proclaimed that politics was \\"obsolete\\" because \\"God doesn't want politics any more,\\" constructed an \\"apocalypse of our times,\\" and recommended the \\"healthy instincts\\" of the Russian people, their longing for authority, and their hostility to modernism.Vasilij Rozanov: The Apocalypse of Our Times, 1977, pp. 204, 443, 483 Rozanov starved to death in a monastery in the hungry years following the Revolution. His work was suppressed and largely forgotten in the Soviet Union, though there were some prominent writers, including Maxim Gorky and Venedikt Erofeev among his admirers, and his ideas are thought to have exercised an influence on Vladimir Nabokov's approach to the everyday world of existence (–±—ã—Ç/byt) as utopic.Adam Ure, Vasilii Rozanov and the Creation: The Edenic Vision and the Rejection of Eschatology, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2011 pp. 7, 204, n. 26 Recently, however, his paradoxical writings have once again become available to Russian readers, and there has been somewhat of a resurgence among readers sympathetic to Rozanov's political views. Rozanov is the main source of inspiration for Dmitry Galkovsky's philosophical novel The Infinite Deadlock (1988), which revises 19th-century Russian history and places Rozanov at the center of Russian philosophical thought. Rozanov remains little known outside Russia, though some western scholars have become increasingly fascinated by his work and his persona. Bibliography * Legenda o velikom inkvisitore F.M.

Although published anonymously, its authorship was revealed by the poet George Huddesford in what Burney called a \\"vile poem\\".W. P. Courtney, 'Huddesford, George (bap. 1749, d. 1809)', rev. S. C. Bushell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 6 Feb 2010 In this 3-volume epistolary novel, title character Evelina is the unacknowledged but legitimate daughter of a dissipated English aristocrat, thus raised in rural seclusion until her 17th year. Through a series of humorous events that take place in London and the resort town of Hotwells, near Bristol, Evelina learns to navigate the complex layers of 18th-century society and come under the eye of a distinguished nobleman with whom a romantic relationship is formed in the latter part of the novel. This sentimental novel, which has notions of sensibility and early romanticism, satirizes the society in which it is set and is a significant precursor to the work of Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth, whose novels explore many of the same issues. Plot summary The novel opens with a distressed letter from Lady Howard to her longtime acquaintance, the Reverend Arthur Villars, in which she reports that Mme (Madame) Duval, the grandmother of Villars' ward, Evelina Anville, intends to visit England to renew her acquaintance with her granddaughter Evelina. Eighteen years earlier, Mme Duval had broken off her relationship with her daughter Caroline, Evelina's mother, but never knew of the birth or even existence of Evelina until Evelina was in her late teens. Upon this discovery, Mme Duval desires to reclaim Evelina and whisk her away to France as her closest blood relation. Reverend Villars fears Mme Duval's influence could lead Evelina to a fate similar to that of her mother Caroline, who secretly wedded Sir John Belmont, a libertine, who afterwards denied the marriage. To keep Evelina from Mme Duval, the Reverend lets her visit Howard Grove, Lady Howard's home, on an extended holiday. While she is there, the family learns that Lady Howard's son-in-law, naval officer Captain Mirvan, is returning to England after a seven-year absence. Desperate to join the Mirvans on their trip to London, Evelina entreats her guardian to let her attend with them, promising that the visit will last only a few weeks. Villars reluctantly consents. In London, Evelina's beauty and ambiguous social status attract unwanted attention and unkind speculation. Ignorant of the conventions and behaviours of 18th-century London society, she makes a series of humiliating (but humorous) faux pas that further expose her to social ridicule. She soon earns the attentions of two gentlemen: Lord Orville, a handsome and extremely eligible peer and pattern- card of modest, becoming behaviour; and Sir Clement Willoughby, a baronet with duplicitous intentions. Evelina's untimely reunion in London with her grandmother and the Branghtons, her long-unknown extended family, along with the embarrassment their boorish, social-climbing antics cause, soon convince Evelina that Lord Orville is completely out of reach. The Mirvans finally return to the country, taking Evelina and Mme Duval with them. Spurred by Evelina's greedy cousins, Mme Duval concocts a plan to sue Sir John Belmont, Evelina's father, and force him to recognize his daughter's claim to his estate in court. Reverend Villars is displeased, and they decide against a lawsuit, but Lady Howard still writes to Sir John Belmont, who responds unfavourably. He does not believe it possible for Evelina to be his daughter, as he already has a young lady who is his supposed daughter (who, unbeknownst to him is actually illegitimate), and therefore assumes Mme Duval to be trying to dupe him for his money. Mme Duval is furious and threatens to rush Evelina back to Paris to pursue the lawsuit. A second compromise sees Evelina return to London with her grandmother, where she is forced to spend time with her ill-bred Branghton cousins and their rowdy friends, but she is distracted by Mr. Macartney, a melancholy and direly-poor Scottish poet. Finding him with a pair of pistols, she supposed him to be considering suicide and bids him to look to his salvation; later he informs her that he has been contemplating not only self-destruction but more-so highway robbery. He is in dreadful financial straits, is engaged in tracing his own obscure parentage, as well as recovering from his mother's sudden death and the discovery that his beloved is actually his sister. Evelina charitably gives him her purse. Otherwise, her time with the Branghtons is uniformly mortifying: during her visit to the Marylebone pleasure garden, for instance, she is attacked by a drunken sailor and accosted by several rowdy men before being rescued by prostitutes‚Äîand in this humiliating company, she meets Lord Orville again. Sure that he can never respect her now, she is stunned when he seeks her out in London's unfashionable section and seems interested in renewing their acquaintance. When an insulting and brash letter supposedly from Lord Orville devastates her and makes her believe she misperceived him, she returns home to Berry Hill and falls ill. Slowly recuperating from her illness, Evelina agrees to accompany her neighbour, a sarcastically tempered widow named Mrs. Selwyn, to the resort town of Clifton Heights, where she unwillingly attracts the attention of womanizer Lord Merton, on the eve of his marriage to Lord Orville's sister, Lady Louisa Larpent. Aware of Lord Orville's arrival, Evelina tries to distance herself from him because of his impertinent letter, but his gentle manners work their spell until she is torn between attraction to him and belief in his past duplicity. The unexpected appearance of Mr. Macartney reveals an unexpected streak of jealousy in the seemingly imperturbable Lord Orville. Convinced that Macartney is a rival for Evelina's affections, Lord Orville withdraws. However, Macartney has intended only to repay his financial debt to Evelina. Lord Orville's genuine affection for Evelina and her assurances that she and Macartney are not involved finally win out over Orville's jealousy, and he secures a meeting between Evelina and Macartney. It appears that all doubts have been resolved between Lord Orville and Evelina, especially when Mrs. Selwyn informs her that she overheard Lord Orville arguing with Sir Clement Willoughby about the latter's inappropriate attentions to Evelina. Lord Orville proposes, much to Evelina's delight. However, Evelina is distraught at the continuing gulf between herself and her father and the mystery surrounding his false daughter. Finally, Mrs. Selwyn is able to secure a surprise meeting with Sir John. When he sees Evelina, he is horrified and guilt-stricken because she clearly resembles her mother, Caroline. This means that the other Miss Belmont (the false daughter) is recognized as a fraud. Evelina is able to ease his guilt with her repeated gentle pardons and the delivery of a letter written by her mother on her deathbed in which she forgives Sir John for his behaviour if he will remove her ignominy (by acknowledging their marriage) and acknowledge Evelina as his legitimate daughter. Mrs Clifton, Berry Hill's longtime housekeeper, is able to reveal the second Miss Belmont's parentage. She identifies Polly Green, Evelina's former wet nurse, mother of a girl 6 weeks older than Evelina, as the perpetrator of the fraud. Polly has been passing her own daughter off as that of Sir John and Caroline for the past 18 years, hoping to secure a better future for her. Ultimately, Lord Orville suggests that the unfortunate girl be named co-heiress with Evelina; kindhearted Evelina is delighted. Finally, Sir Clement Willoughby writes to Evelina, confessing that he had written the insulting letter (she had already suspected this), hoping to separate Evelina and Lord Orville. In Paris, Mr. Macartney is reunited with the false Miss Belmont, his former beloved: separated by Sir John, at first because Macartney was too poor and lowly to marry his purported daughter, and then because his affair with Macartney's mother would have made the sweethearts brother and sister, they are now able to marry because Miss \\"Belmont\\"'s true parentage has been revealed and the two are not related at all. They are married in a joint ceremony alongside Evelina and Lord Orville, who decide to visit Reverend Villars at Berry Hill for their honeymoon trip.Frances Burney, Evelina, or, the history of a young lady's entrance into the world: authoritative text, contexts and contemporary reactions, criticism, edited by Stewart J. Cooke, New York: Norton, 1998, . Characters * Miss Evelina Anville, the novel's main character, is the daughter of Lady Caroline Belmont (born Caroline Evelyn) and Sir John Belmont. A series of letters convey the story, and she summarizes specific experiences of her life, mainly to her guardian/pseudo- father Reverend Villars. She embodies the desirable traits for women at the time. Although she is called a social \\"nobody\\" by the fop Mr. Lovel, other characters have high opinions of her. She is deemed \\"a very pretty modest- looking girl\\" by Lord Orville and an \\"angel\\" by Sir Clement in the first volume. The novel traces her trials and tribulations and growing confidence in her own abilities and discernment. * Reverend Arthur Villars is the man who raised Evelina as his own and refers to her as the \\"child of his heart.\\" He is her tutor and guardian, as well as Evelina's father figure in the novel. Taking in the disgraced Lady Belmont (Caroline), he vowed to be the protector of her child. He is Evelina's moral guide and confidant throughout the novel. * Sir Clement Willoughby is a minor nobleman (baronet). Evelina meets him at the infamous Ridotto during her first visit to London. A steadfast pursuer of Evelina's good favour, he courts her very forwardly with flamboyant proclamations and flattering speeches. Evelina dislikes him, only tolerating him because he curries favour with Captain Mirvan and Mrs. Selwyn. He also accompanies Captain Mirvan whenever he assaults, provokes, or teases Madame Duval. * Lord Orville is a fine gentleman and earl who rescues Evelina on several occasions, including from the advances of Sir Clement. He falls into her good graces simply by conducting himself in a manner befitting his rank and person. He is open, engaging, gentle, attentive, and expressive. * Captain Mirvan is a retired navy captain who despises foreigners and constantly annoys Madame Duval. Husband of Mrs. Mirvan and father of Maria, he sometimes greatly embarrasses his family (or so Evelina perceives). * Mrs. Mirvan is a woman who shows much compassion and concern for Evelina. She looks after her during her visits to London and Howard Grove, treating Evelina as her second child. * Miss Maria Mirvan is a childhood friend of Evelina's, her true companion and confidante. * Mme Duval is Evelina's English grandmother, who pretends to be French. She wants to take Evelina to France, away from English influence in general and Rev. Villars in particular. She is stubborn and ignorant; therefore, she is repugnant to Evelina. * M. Dubois is Madame Duval's companion. He speaks only French and some broken English. Evelina bonds with him during her second residence in London because comparisons to her lowly Branghton cousins elevate her opinion of him. Unfortunately, this encourages him to make unwanted advances that infuriate Mme Duval. Captain Mirvan nicknames him \\"Monseer Slippery\\" because he once slipped in mud while carrying Mme Duval. * The Branghtons are Evelina's London relations, a mercantile family who own a silversmith's shop in High Holborn. Evelina must associate with them on her second visit to London; she grows impatient with their crass behaviour and is embarrassed to be thought of as in their party, especially when she meets Lord Orville in their company. The Misses Branghton are jealous of the attention their own beaux give Evelina; their brother eventually attempts, unsuccessfully, to propose to Evelina through Mme Duval. * Mr. Macartney is an impoverished Scottish poet who boards with the Branghtons and is the butt of many of their contemptuous jokes. Evelina rescues him during what she perceives to be a suicide attempt; he later revealed he had been unable to decide between that and armed robbery. This desperate action had been brought on by his mother's death and the discovery that his beloved was actually his unacknowledged sister. When the young woman's actual parentage is revealed, they are able to marry. He is Evelina's half-brother as his father is Sir John Belmont. * Lord Merton first met Evelina at an assembly. He is reintroduced to her later in Bristol as the fianc√© of Lord Orville's sister. Along with his companion, Mr. Coverly, Lord Merton reveals himself to be a drunken, gambling rake. * Mr. Lovel is Evelina's rejected dance partner from her first assembly. Though he realizes her action of accepting another dance partner (Lord Orville) after refusing him is due to her lack of knowledge about society, he is furious and seizes every opportunity to embarrass her.

NTK was published weekly from 1997 until 2004, when it moved to fortnightly publication. From May 2005 until July 2006 it continued on a monthly schedule, though it often ran late; the final newsletter on the website is a \\"MiniNTK\\" dated 8 January 2007. The newsletter billed itself as \\"the weekly tech update for the UK\\" (later \\"week^H^H^H^H fortnightly\\" or \\"week^H^H^H^H now-monthly\\") and presented the highlights of the week's happenings in the IT, blogosphere and general internet community. NTK frequently concentrated on British issues, such as UK legislation like the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act and the UK Campaign for Digital Rights. It has also looked at less-weighty matters such as confectionery and nudity in films. It took an irreverent tone similar to the later The Register and the earlier Private Eye and Viz. The original manifesto for NTK, showing its Special Projects origins, suggests the intent of the publication while attracting the target demographic. Format The newsletter is also available on the World Wide Web and has used a fixed-width ASCII text-based layout since its inception. It was sent to subscribers in plain-text email. Since 2004 the website has offered readers the ability to use their own style sheet, providing some variety. Each newsletter comprised (at least some of) the following sections: * An ASCII art representation of the letters \\"NTKnow\\", along with the strapline and date. * An ironic or amusing quote of the week, not seen since April 2005, when NTK was weekly. * HARD NEWS: Important, but not necessarily mainstream, news stories from the IT world during that week. Each story is accompanied by URLs for further reading. * ANTI-NEWS, later ANTI-MEMES: A collection of \\"D'Oh!\\"s; errors in mainstream news articles such as using the wrong image for a story, typos, inappropriate web adverts, meta-information for editors or page filler that was accidentally published unedited, or even outright nonsense like \\"Columbia: shuttle travelling nearly 18 times the speed of light\\". This section was later spun off into a separate site, D'Oh! the humanity! (now defunct). From 2002 onwards, the section also intermittently included themed lists of \\"google goofs\\": Google results for searches using misspellings such as \\"first aid tit\\" or \\"penny farting\\". * EVENT QUEUE: Events to attend that may be of interest to technologically minded people. This included visits to the UK by open source leaders, sci-fi conventions and blogging conferences, as well as talks and seminars by the NTK writers and their friends. The selections were frequently London-centric, attracting criticism from readership living north of Watford Gap, although with O'Brien's move to California, the geographical range of events covered widened; Burning Man usually merited an annual mention. * TRACKING: Focussed on interesting, useful, or just plain esoteric software. The selection was not limited to any particular platform; software for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X all features regularly, and occasionally software for the C64 and ZX Spectrum, such as a mini TCP/IP stack, was included if it was particularly interesting or could be mocked in an amusing fashion. The section also sometimes included reviews of web-services like BugMeNot rather than conventional software. * MEMEPOOL: like Memepool, a collection of the week's best Internet memes. * GEEK MEDIA: short synopses of television programmes or films that are of interest to a geek audience. Films also include BBFC ratings for added irony. * After the geek media section, there was a schedule of rotating extra items, including \\"Confectionery Theory\\" (reviewing new sweets upon their arrival in the UK, later outsourced to snackspot.org.uk), \\"feebdack\\" (as a form of letters page; the title referring to a coinage in Rudy Rucker's The Hacker and the Ants), \\"boners\\" (correction of errors in NTK itself), and an occasional music review section. * SMALL PRINT: Other than containing the basic meta-information that NTK is a newsletter, published every week, etc., this section always included the motto \\"THEY STOLE OUR REVOLUTION. NOW WE'RE STEALING IT BACK\\" and the phrase \\"Registered at the Post Office as\\", which is usually completed by an oblique reference to another website or publication that has itself referenced NTK, Danny or Dave. For example, it linked to their Wikipedia article.NTK.net, 1 October 2004. Significant events *13 February 1998: NTK launched the Falco competition, named after the rock star Falco who died that week. Readers were encouraged to mail their predictions of which technology companies would fail (dot-bombs), and NTK would proclaim \\"FALCO\\" with the list of accurate tipsters when announcing that companies had actually failed. This practise predated Fucked Company by two years. *11 December 1998: NTK launch STAND.org.uk (now defunct), a UK campaign group lobbying for fair UK internet policy. *18 February 2000: NTK launch Kevin Warwick Watch (now defunct) in reaction to Kevin Warwick's sudden popularity in the mainstream press. *1 September 2000: NTK launch a \\"drily ironic t-shirt competition\\", where readers can come up with amusing T-shirt designs and NTK can sell the results back to them. *1 December 2000: NTK and STAND launch \\"Fax your MP\\" (now part of WriteToThem). They also launch their own ironic T-shirt sales site, NTKMart (now defunct). *3 August 2001: NTK publish the now infamous \\"dancemonkeyboy\\" video of Steve Ballmer dancing to Gloria Estefan music at a developer conference. NTK.net *8 June 2002: NTK host their own conference; X-COM 2002 *28 March 2003: NTK launch Snackspot *6 June 2004: NTK host another conference, NotCon '04 (http://www.notcon04.com now defunct) *6 August 2004: NTK launch dohthehumanity.com (now defunct) References External links *Need To Know website, includes archive of all past newsletters British news websites Publications established in 1997 1997 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Need to Know (newsletter)"},{"id":"1000352","text":"NTK could refer to: * Naam Tamilar Katchi, political party in Tamil Nadu, India * N√°rodn√≠ technick√° knihovna, library in Prague, Czech Republic * Need to Know (newsletter) * Newton Toolkit, for the Newton (platform) PDA * Ngau Tau Kok Station, Hong Kong, MTR station code ","title":"NTK"},{"id":"1000354","text":"The Aero Ae 01 was a Czechoslovakian military trainer biplane built in 1919 and was Aero's first attempt to modify one of the aircraft designs they had been manufacturing under licence during World War I, the Hansa-Brandenburg B.I.

He frequently discusses such topics as education choice, the growth of government, the ownership society, his support of drug legalization as a consequence of the individual right to self-determination, a non-interventionist foreign policy, and the rise of libertarianism on national television and radio shows. Boaz's 1988 The New York Times op-ed on the high cost of the drug war invited debate over the decriminalization of drugs. His articles have also been published in the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, National Review, and Slate.

Oswald, 592 F.2d 174 (3d Cir. 1974), was a case about the voting rights of undergraduate students at a public American university. Facts The board of trustees for the Pennsylvania State University was selected through a process involving several groups aside from the state executive branch (the governor) and the university. The groups included a society of the alumni of the university and local agricultural and industrial societies of Pennsylvania. A group of undergraduate students at the university sued desiring to be involved in the selection process for some of those seats currently selected through the society elections. Issue The question presented by this case was whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the election of the Pennsylvania State University board of trustees--thereby allowing them to have a voice in the board's makeup. Holding The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the court held, did not require the undergraduate students be allowed to participate in the selection of the board of trustees. The court ruled that the selection process for the board does \\"serve important governmental objective\\" and is \\"substantially related to the achievement of those objectives\\". The court decided the election of members of the board of trustees was not equivalent to general elections and the issues addressed in Kramer v. Union School District and Hadley v. Junior College District of Kansas City were not germane. The court also reviewed whether the selection process was reasonable, and decided that it was, as the university sprang from \\"a land grant college committed to the teaching of agriculture and the mechanic arts.\\" References External links United States education case law United States equal protection case law 1974 in United States case law 1974 in education United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit cases Pennsylvania State University University governance ","title":"Benner v.

Located in a strategically important region, Trabzon is one of the oldest trade port cities in Anatolia. Neighbouring provinces are Giresun to the west, G√ºm√º≈ühane to the southwest, Bayburt to the southeast and Rize to the east. The major ethnic groups are Turks, but the province is also home to a minority of Muslim Pontic Greek speakers,Pontic Greek: Romeika of Trabzon though younger speakers are not always fluent in this language. ƒ∞smail Ustaoƒülu was appointed the Governor of the province in October 2018. The capital of the province is Trabzon. Districts Trabzon province is divided into 18 districts: *Trabzon (Central district, after 2014 it will be named Ortahisar) Districts along the 114 km coastline (from west to east): Be≈üikd√ºz√º, Vakfƒ±kebir, √áar≈üƒ±ba≈üƒ±, Ak√ßaabat, Yomra, Arsin, Araklƒ±, S√ºrmene and Of.Trabzon city Districts inland: Tonya, D√ºzk√∂y, ≈ûalpazarƒ±, Ma√ßka, K√∂pr√ºba≈üƒ±, Dernekpazarƒ±, Hayrat and √áaykara.

Starting from the 9th century BC, the city had also been mentioned by historians such as Homeros, Herodotus, Hesiodos. The first written source regarding Trabzon is Anabasis, authored by Xenophon. An important Roman and Byzantine centre, it was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond from 1204 to 1461. Trabzon was subsequently made part of the Ottoman Empire by Mehmet the Conqueror. After the region was conquered in 1461, the Fatih Medrese (1462), Hatuniye Medrese (1515), ƒ∞skender Pasha Medrese (1529) and Hamza Pasha Medrese (1543) were established as important medreses (educational centers; some of them within k√ºlliye complexes) of the period.Trabzon history It was initially a sanjak before gaining the status of eyalet, and finally became a vilayet in 1868. The province was a site of major fighting between Ottoman and Russian forces during the Caucasus Campaign of World War I, which resulted in the capture of the city of Trabzon by the Russian army under command of Grand Duke Nicholas and Nikolai Yudenich in April 1916. The province was restored to Turkish control in early 1918 following Russia's exit from World War I with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. = In Turkey = In September 1935 the third Inspectorate General (Umumi M√ºfetti≈ülik, UM) was created. Its creation was based on the Law 1164 from June 1927, which was passed in order to Turkefy the population. The Trabzon province was included in this area. The third UM span over the provinces of Erzurum, Artvin, Rize, Trabzon, Kars, G√ºm√º≈ühane, Erzincan and Aƒürƒ±. It was governed by an Inspector General seated in the city of Erzurum.

The boat was named in honor of both the cities of Springfield, Illinois and Springfield, Massachusetts. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 21 March 1986, and her keel was laid down on 29 January 1990. She was launched on 4 January 1992 sponsored by Lynn Martin, and commissioned on 9 January 1993 with Commander Richard K. Ford in command. Springfield is homeported at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine and is assigned to Submarine Squadron FOUR. In mid-2004, Springfield began an extensive overhaul, or Depot Modernization Period (DMP), at the Electric Boat shipyard in Groton. In addition to normal periodic maintenance and repairs, Springfield received extensive modernization in fire control systems, sonar processing, weapons launch systems, and communications outfit, a ring laser gyro inertial navigation system, as well as stealth improvements and engine room upgrades. The modernization was the first major overhaul and repair job for Electric Boat in almost 25 years. Originally awarded as a 12 month, $26.3 million depot modernization, Springfield was to be the test case for the possibility of awarding future repair and overhaul contracts to Electric Boat. The overhaul was plagued by cost and time overruns, and when finally completed in December 2005, it was several months late and well over budget. Electric Boat has not been awarded any DMP contracts since. Springfield arrived at PNSY on 1 December 2016 to begin an Engineering Overhaul. Springfield will undergo planned maintenance work and system certifications primarily focused on modernizing systems associated with the boat's engine room.  Awards  Springfield has deployed overseas on many occasions and earned several Meritorious Unit Commendations and Battle \\"E\\" Efficiency awards. In 1998, Springfield won the Captain Edward F. Ney Silver Cup Trophy for outstanding food service (first place in the submarine category). The Ney Memorial Awards, presented annually to the top Navy galleys in ten categories, were established by the Secretary of the Navy and the International Food Service Executives Association (IFSEA) in 1958. Quoted in In 2002 the boat received the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy for most improved ship in the Atlantic Fleet, while under command of Commander D.P. Forney. In 2003 the boat was awarded the Retention Excellence Award for her squadron. She has also won multiple awards for Navigation, Engineering, Medical, Supply, Damage Control and Deck Seamanship excellence in various years. On 14 July 2014, command of the boat was changed to Commander Daniel Lombardo at a ceremony in Groton, Connecticut. On 18 November 2016, command of the boat was changed to Commander Brent Spillner from Captain Roger Meyer at a ceremony in Groton, Connecticut.

Berea College, 161 S.W. 204 (Ky. 1913), was a case heard before the Kentucky Court of Appeals wherein a restaurant owner sued a college when the college issued a new policy forbidding students from patronizing establishments not owned by the college. Facts Around September 1, 1911, J.S. Gott‚Äîa businessman in Berea, Kentucky‚Äîpurchased a restaurant located across a street from Berea College. A restaurant had been at that location for some years, and primarily subsisted on business from students from the college. Unbeknownst to Gott, during the 1911 summer vacation, the college authorities had revised the student code. Previously, the student code had forbidden students from entering \\"any place of ill repute, liquor saloons, gambling houses\\" or similar places. Beginning with the fall semester, which started September 11, 1911, the college promulgated the updated student code, which forbade students from entering \\"eating houses and places of amusement in Berea not controlled by the college\\". The punishment for any violation was immediate dismissal. Shortly after the new code was published, some students who continued to patronize Gott's restaurant were caught and expelled. On September 20, Gott filed suit against the college, obtaining an injunction to enjoin enforcement of the rule, and initially seeking $500 in damages. He later requested an additional $1,500, claiming that the college had slandered him by telling the student body that Gott was a bootlegger. In the proceedings that followed, the injunction was dissolved, and the Gott's petition was ultimately dismissed. He appealed the dismissal. Judgment The court acknowledged that Gott's business had been much reduced after the rule was effected but the question was whether the college's actions were unlawful. The court first determined that because Berea College was acting in loco parentis, the college did have the authority to issue the rule and that students at the college were obligated to conform their behavior to the rule since a \\"...college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student impliedly agrees to conform to such rules of government.\\" The court noted that a public institution, one supported \\"from the public treasure\\" had more exacting criteria to meet but since Berea College was a private institution, the above implied contract between student and college was sufficient. Next the court reviewed the relationship between Gott and Berea College to determine if there was a contractual relationship which the college had broken but found none. Finally, the court reviewed the question of unreasonable, malicious, or wrongful restraint of trade by the actions of the college but could find no evidence of such.  See also  * Berea College v.

Edmund Curll, in an attempt to antagonize and siphon off money from Swift, published it in 1710 from a manuscript stolen from Swift (which forced Swift to publish a corrected and authorized version that he also had to write from memory), but the satire's origins lie in Swift's time at Moor Park, Surrey, when he acted as Secretary to William Temple. While in the household, Swift would read passages from Robert Boyle's Occasional Reflections upon Several Subjects (1665) for the young Esther Johnson (\\"Stella\\" to Swift). Boyle's Reflections took the form of meditations on everyday subjects, where they were likened to religious themes. Boyle would consider a fire, or house cleaning, and see in it a reflection of God's relationship to man, or man to his soul. These reflections were very popular in the Temple household. One day, Swift, being bored with the predictability of Boyle's points, wrote his own Meditation and put it into the book. When the time came to read for the day, he read, instead of Boyle, his own Meditation Upon a Broomstick. The ladies of the house did not catch on until near the end of the meditation that it was absurd. Swift later wrote up the Meditation in a more formal manner and published it to counteract Curll's piracy. To get a flavor for the Meditation, consider the last paragraph: :\\"But a Broom-stick, perhaps you'll say, is an Emblem of a Tree standing on its Head; and pray what is Man, but a Topsy-turvy Creature, his Animal Faculties perpetually mounted on his Rational; His Head where his Heels should be; groveling on the Earth, and yet with all his Faults, he sets up to be a universal Reformer and Corrector of Abuses, a Remover of Grievances, rakes into every Slut's Corner of Nature, bringing hidden Corruptions to the Light, and raises a mighty Dust where there was none before, sharing deeply all the while, in the very same Pollutions he pretends to sweep away: His last Days are spent in Slavery to Women, and generally the least deserving; 'till worn to the Stumps, like his Brother Bezom, he's either kicked out of Doors, or made use of to kindle Flames, for others to warm Themselves by.\\" The Meditation begins with a rational moral comparison and proceeds to a frenzy of increasingly unlikely comparisons. While the satire begins with a pitch-perfect imitation of the kindly Boyle's tone, it ends in a frantic, misanthropistic and misogynistic note of despair and nihilism. Also, while it begins with a hopeful call to self-examination, it moves eventually into a condemnation of all efforts at improvement.

Etching by William Hogarth in Beaver's Roman Military Punishments (1725) Decimation (; decem = \\"ten\\") was a form of Roman military discipline in which every tenth man in a group was executed by members of his cohort. The discipline was used by senior commanders in the Roman Army to punish units or large groups guilty of capital offences, such as cowardice, mutiny, desertion, and insubordination, and for pacification of rebellious legions. The word decimation is derived from Latin meaning \\"removal of a tenth\\". The procedure was an attempt to balance the need to punish serious offences with the realities of managing a large group of offenders. Procedure A cohort (roughly 480 soldiers) selected for punishment by decimation was divided into groups of ten. Each group drew lots (sortition), and the soldier on whom the lot of the shortest straw fell was executed by his nine comrades, often by stoning, clubbing, or stabbing. The remaining soldiers were often given rations of barley instead of wheat (the latter being the standard soldier's diet) for a few days, and required to bivouac outside the fortified security of the camp for some time.G. R. Watson, The Roman Soldier (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1969), p. 119 As the punishment fell by lot, all soldiers in a group sentenced to decimation were potentially liable for execution, regardless of individual degrees of fault, rank, or distinction. Usage The earliest documented decimation occurred in 471 BC during the Roman Republic's early wars against the Volsci and is recorded by Livy. In an incident where his army had been scattered, consul Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis had the culprits punished for desertion: centurions, standard-bearers and soldiers who had cast away their weapons were individually scourged and beheaded, while of the remainder, one in ten were chosen by lot and executed.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita, book 2, chapter 59 Polybius gives one of the first descriptions of the practice in the early 3rd century BC: :If ever these same things happen to occur among a large group of men... the officers reject the idea of bludgeoning or slaughtering all the men involved [as is the case with a small group or an individual]. Instead they find a solution for the situation which chooses by a lottery system sometimes five, sometimes eight, sometimes twenty of these men, always calculating the number in this group with reference to the whole unit of offenders so that this group forms one-tenth of all those guilty of cowardice. And these men who are chosen by lot are bludgeoned mercilessly in the manner described above.Polybius, Histories, book 6, chapter 38 The practice was also utilized by Alexander the Great against a corps of 6,000 men. The practice was revived by Marcus Licinius Crassus in 71 BC during the Third Servile War against Spartacus, and some historical sources attribute part of Crassus' success to it. The total number of men killed through decimation is not known, but it varied on occasion between 1,000 from 10,000 men and 48-50 from a cohort of around 480-500 men. A specific instance saw 500 men selected by Cassius from the survivors of two legions which had broken and ran in combat against the rebel slaves. They were divided into groups of ten, one of whom was chosen by lot regardless of actual behavior in the battle. The nine remaining legionaries in each party were then forced to club their former comrade to death. The dual purpose intended was to stiffen discipline amongst the army at large and to demoralise the enemy. Julius Caesar threatened to decimate the 9th Legion during the war against Pompey, but never did.Goldsworthy, Caesar: Life of a Colossus, 407 Plutarch describes the process in his work Life of Antony.Plutarch's Parallel Lives: \\"Antony\\" ~ Internet Classics Archive After a defeat in Media: :Antony was furious and employed the punishment known as \\"decimation\\" on those who had lost their nerve. What he did was divide the whole lot of them into groups of ten, and then he killed one from each group, who was chosen by lot; the rest, on his orders were given barley rations instead of wheat.Plutarch: Antony, c. 39 Decimation was still being practised during the time of the Roman Empire, although it was very uncommon. Suetonius records that it was used by Emperor Augustus in 17 BCSuetonius, Augustus, 24 and later by Galba,Suetonius, Galba, 12 while Tacitus records that Lucius Apronius used decimation to punish a full cohort of the III Augusta after their defeat by Tacfarinas in AD 20.Tacitus, Annals, 3 G.R. Watson notes that \\"its appeal was to those obsessed with nimio amore antiqui moris\\" ‚Äì that is, an excessive love for ancient customs ‚Äì and notes, \\"Decimation itself, however, was ultimately doomed, for though the army might be prepared to assist in the execution of innocent slaves, professional soldiers could hardly be expected to cooperate in the indiscriminate execution of their own comrades.\\"Watson, Roman Soldier, p. 120 The emperor Macrinus instituted a less harsh centesimatio, the execution of every 100th man. According to legend, the Theban Legion, led by Saint Maurice, was decimated in the third century AD.Codex Parisiensis, Biblioth√®que nationale, 9550, reproduced in Louis Dupraz, Les passions de st Maurice d'Agaune: Essai sur l'historicit√© de la tradition et contribution √† l'√©tude de l'arm√©e pr√©- Diocl√©tienne (260-286) et des canonisations tardives de la fin du IVe si√®cle (Fribourg 1961), Appdx I. on the historicity of the Theban Legion. The Legion had refused, to a man, to accede to an order of the Emperor, and the process was repeated until none were left. They became known as the Martyrs of Agaunum. The Eastern Roman Emperor Maurice forbade in his Strategikon the decimatio and other brutal punishments. According to him, punishments where the rank and file see their comrades dying by the hands of their own brothers- in-arms could lead to a collapse of morale. Moreover, it could seriously deplete the manpower of the fighting unit. Post-classical instances =17th century= Von Sparr's cuirassier regiment in Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim's corps fled the field during the Battle of L√ºtzen (1632) during the Thirty Years' War. The Imperial commander, Wallenstein, appointed a court martial, which directed the execution of the officer in command, Col Hagen, together with Lt Col Hofkirchen, ten other officers and five troopers. They were beheaded with the sword, while two men found guilty of looting the baggage were sentenced to a less honourable death by hanging. The remaining troopers were decimated, one in every ten cavalrymen being hanged; the others were assembled beneath the gallows, beaten, branded and declared outlaws. Their standards were burned by an executioner after the Emperor's monogram had been cut from the fabric. Similarly, during the Battle of Breitenfeld (1642), near Leipzig, Colonel Madlon's cavalry regiment was the first that fled without striking a blow. This was followed by the massive flight of other cavalry units, which was the final turning point in the battle. The battle was a decisive victory for the Swedish army under the command of Field Marshal Lennart Torstenson over an Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire under the command of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria and his deputy, Prince-General Ottavio Piccolomini, Duke of Amalfi. Archduke Leopold Wilhelm assembled a court-martial in Prague which sentenced the Madlon regiment to exemplary punishment. Six regiments, which had distinguished themselves in the battle, were assembled fully armed, and surrounded Madlon's regiment, which was severely rebuked for its cowardice and misconduct, and ordered to lay down its arms at the feet of General Piccolomini. When they had obeyed this command, their ensigns (flags) were torn in pieces; and the general, having mentioned the causes of their degradation, and erased the regiment from the register of the imperial troops, pronounced the sentence that had been agreed upon in the council of war, condemning the colonel, captains and lieutenants to be beheaded, the ensigns (junior officers) to be hanged, the soldiers to be decimated and the survivors to be driven in disgrace out of the army. Ninety men (chosen by rolling dice) were executed at Rokycany, in western Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, on December 14, 1642 by Jan Mydl√°≈ô (junior), the son of Jan Mydl√°≈ô, the famous executioner from Prague. On the first day of the execution, the regiment's cords were broken by the executioner. On the second day, officers were beheaded and selected men hanged on the trees on the road from Rokycany to Litohlavy. Another version says that the soldiers were shot, and their bodies hanged on the trees. Their mass grave is said to be on the Black Mound in Rokycany, which commemorates the decimation to this day. =19th and 20th century= On September 3, 1866, during the Battle of Curuzu, during the Paraguayan War, the Paraguayan 10th Battalion fled without firing a shot. President Lopez ordered the decimation of the battalion, which was accordingly formed into line and every tenth man shot.Thompson, G, 1869, The War in Paraguay, London: Longmans Green and Co., pp.171-172 In 1914, in France, there was a case in which a company of Tunisian tirailleurs (colonial soldiers) refused an order to attack and was ordered decimated by the divisional commander. This involved the execution of ten men.P. 35, Race and War in France, Richard Fogarty, 2008 Johns Hopkins Press Italian General Luigi Cadorna allegedly applied decimation to underperforming units during World War I.Huw Strachan (2003) The First World War However, the British military historian John Keegan records that his \\"judicial savagery\\" during the Battle of Caporetto took the form of the summary executions of individual stragglers rather than the formalized winnowing of entire detachments.Keegan, John. The First World War. pp. 375‚Äì376. . Certainly one specific instance of actual decimation did occur in the Italian Army during the war, on 26 May 1916. This involved the execution of one in ten soldiers of a 120 strong company of the 141st Catanzaro Infantry Brigade, which had mutinied. Officers, carabinieri and non-mutinying soldiers had been killed during the outbreak. During the suppression of the German Revolution 29 men from the Volksmarinedivision were executed after 300 men turned up to receive their discharge papers and back pay. In the Russian Civil War, Leon Trotsky as leader of the Red Army ordered decimation for deserters. At one point of the Battle of Stalingrad in the Second World War, the commander of the Soviet 64th Rifle Division had resorted to decimation as a punishment for cowardice. Decimation can be also used to punish the enemy. In 1918, in the Finnish Civil War, the White troops, after conquering the Red city of Varkaus, summarily executed around 80 captured Reds in what became known as the Lottery of Huruslahti. According to some accounts, the Whites ordered all the captured Reds to assemble in a single row on the ice of Lake Huruslahti, selected every tenth prisoner, and executed him on the spot. The selection was not entirely random though, as some prisoners (primarily Red leaders) were specifically selected for execution and some other individuals were intentionally spared.http://web.varkaus.fi/Varkaus_1918/flash.html Current usage of the word The word decimation in English is often used to refer to an extreme reduction in the number of a population or force or an overall sense of destruction and ruin.

The organisation was founded in 1921. It has around 47 affiliated students' unions, gathering around 270,000 students (2012).http://sfs.se/medlemskarer The large number of organised students can in part be explained by the fact that membership in the official local students' union was mandatory for students at universities and university colleges in Sweden until 2010.http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/karobligatoriet-avskaffat The requirement has a long history back to the precursor to Swedish students' unions, the students' nations where membership became mandatory in 1667. The local students' union is, however, free to decide whether to join the National Union of Students or not. Although a majority of the students' unions are members, some have opted to stay out, including several organising business, law and medicine students. Occasionally, affiliated unions choose to leave the organisation, but sometimes rejoin at a later date, a pattern followed by both the Stockholm University Students' Union and the Uppsala Student Union. The organisation works to represent the interest of its members on a national level, towards the Government, the Swedish Parliament, the political parties and the government agencies concerned with higher education. The organisation is also active on the international arena, particularly within the European Students' Union, ESU. At the annual national conference representatives from the member students' unions meet to decide on the policy framework of the organisation and to elect a national board. The board has 15 members, including the President and two or three Vice Presidents. The President and the Vice Presidents work full-time at the head office in Stockholm during their term. Several former student politicians in Sweden have moved on to high-level national party politics.

He is best known for his hosting appearances in the 1990s on MuchMusic and his own late night talk show, Ed's Night Party.Ed the Sock brings his wisecracks back to TV The Canadian Press, May 13, 2010 (Article by Bill Brioux) He is a gray sock puppet with green hair, round eyes, a scowl, a cigar and a rough, gravelly voice. History = Politics = In the 1980s Kerzner was a political aspirant. In the 1990 Ontario general election he ran in the riding of Wilson Heights for Mike Harris' Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, but finished third to the Liberal and NDP candidates. Results of 1990 Ontario provincial election for the riding of Wilson Heights: Kerzner also ran for school trustee for his local school board in 1990, losing that race as well. A fiscal and foreign-policy conservative, Kerzner's political heroes were Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Harris and Brian Mulroney. Since the mid-2000s he has offered more left-of center views, stating in a 2009 interview that he is \\"no longer a conservative\\".Sock it to me! At home with Ed The Sock's creator The Toronto Star, April 4, 2009 (Article by Rita Zekas) In recent years, he has vigorously defended Liberal Justin Trudeau, particularly in the wake of the SNC-Lavalin scandal.Ed the Sock Weighs in on the SNC- Lavalin Scandal In a 2012 interview in which he spoke in favor of the legalization of marijuana, Kerzner stated that the war on drugs was an impossible mistake and said vices such as liquor, gambling and smoking are only taxed because \\"they make us feel good\\". = Television =  Newton Cable (1984‚Äì1993)  As a teenager in 1984 Kerzner began volunteering through a student co-op program at Newton Cable, a small local station in Downsview, Ontario. By 1987 Kerzner became a producer and director of programming.The rough life of Ed the Sock TV GUIDE, 2010-06-03 (Article by Janine Oliveira) During this time one of the public access shows the station produced needed a co-host on short notice, so Kerzner took a sock and other supplies from the station's craft closet and made a sock puppet with glue caps for eyes. He named the puppet Ed after Ed Asner and co-hosted the segment himself. He enjoyed the experience and continued to do the character, improving the sock puppet's look and changing its voice somewhat over time. In these early years Ed the Sock served as the sidekick to The Late Late Show's human hosts, which included Stan Glass, Harland Williams and Eric Tunney (for almost three years). Tim Rykert also hosted for a time.  Rogers Cable (1993‚Äì1995)  After Newton was purchased by Rogers in 1993, Kerzner repackaged The Late Late Show for a wider cable audience. At this point Tunney as its host and star. The new show attracted the interest of producer John Brunton, who took the program to CITY-TV. CityTV (1995‚Äì2008) The logo of Ed & Red's Night Party = Night Party = The show, which would come to be known as Night Party, debuted on February 10, 1995, at 10:30pm Eastern Time. When Tunney left the show to pursue TV hosting and comedy opportunities in the U.S., he was replaced by \\"Humble\\" Howard Glassman (better known as half of the local radio morning show Humble & Fred), and though Ed the Sock was the only returning element of the old show he was still a sidekick to the star and not the star himself. The synopsis of the show's first season reads: \\"Humble Howard and sidekick Ed the cigar smoking, wise-guy sock host a talk show featuring talent spotlights, celebrity interviews and studio audience interaction\\". Within the show's first year Brunton and Glassman both departed the series. Brunton cited creative differences with Kerzner, while Humble Howard said he simply could no longer stand working with Kerzner. Their relationship remains contentious today:Ed the Sock on his Feud with Humble Howard After Humble Howard's departure the show continued with more focus on Ed and less on his human co-host. Canadian comedian Craig Campbell replaced Glassman and stayed with the show for a decade. Ed's longest running and arguably most popular co-host, Campbell had a very laid-back demeanor and took a more polite approach with the audience, playing \\"good cop\\" to Ed's cruder antics. In 2008 Ed's Night Party entered its 14th season and in a surprise move, Campbell was replaced by Steven Joel Kerzner's wife Liana Kerzner (billing herself as \\"Liana K\\" and frequently referred to simply as \\"Red\\" by Ed). Ed's first female co-host, she was a busty redhead who produced a pin-up calendar of herself which was offered for sale on Ed's website. Liana had dropped out of school in 1997 when she and Kerzner started dating to become a writer and co-producer on the show. After the addition of his wife as co-host in what would become its final season, the show was re-branded as Ed & Red's Night Party and increasingly emphasized appearances by porn stars, strippers in a hot tub, and the kind of frat-party excesses that Ed used to pillory.Ed the Sock June 19, 2008 (Article by JD) This resulted in criticism and complaints, largely from female viewers who grew tired of the shows rampant sexist clips and comments, which included such segments as LoCoDe (Lowest Common Denominator), porn star visits, and weekly clips of drunk spring break girls in Wet T-shirt contests with Ed providing joke commentary. In its 14th and final season the series was also broadcast on G4 in the U.S. as part of their Midnight Spank late night television programming block. In June, 2008 Rogers announced that Ed & Red's Night Party would be canceled as of August 31, 2008 in an effort to attract female viewers, who disapproved of Ed's politically incorrect and sexist shtick. THE TORONTO STAR, June 25, 2008 (Article by Raju Mudhar) The final show aired Friday, August 29, 2008. This also marked the end of Kerzner's relationship with both Much and CityTV, with Kerzner stating after Rogers announced their decision to ax Ed the Sock: \\"It appears Citytv is heading towards something more of a women's channel, I don't know.\\" After Night Party's cancellation, Kerzner stated that the Ed character would live on in other projects that were already in the works, \\"for this fall or possibly a few months after that\\", including other shows on competing networks and a feature film, though these projects never materialized and he remained off the air for more than two years.  Ed's Nite In  At CityTV, Ed also hosted Ed's Nite In, a short-lived series in which he would invite \\"friends\\" over to watch (and make fun of) bad movies. The show was slightly different from Ed's later bad movie show This Movie Sucks! in that the movies they broadcast were more current in Ed's Nite In and Ed and his friends did not comment during the movies, only before and after commercial breaks, which also included sketches.  MuchMusic (1995‚Äì2005)  After moving Night Party to CityTV, Ed also began making appearances concurrently on MuchMusic. This lasted from the mid-1990s until he was released by Much in 2005. = Ed's Big Wham Bam = While at Much, Ed hosted the short-lived series Ed's Big Wham Bam, a live weekly two-hour program that featured viewers performing talents such as singing, dancing, and cooking. The show was canceled by the network due to poor ratings. = Fromage takeover = In the late 1990s, MuchMusic VJ Christopher Ward, the creator of Much's annual Fromage special (so named because it mocked the year's \\"cheesiest\\" music videos), decided to no longer host the show himself. Ed accepted an offer to take over hosting duties, which he did until Much canceled the specials in 2005. Fromage may be the most popular project Ed has been involved with, and he has repeatedly stated that he plans to bring it back in some form.  CHCH-TV Hamilton (2010‚Äì2012)  This Movie Sucks! as seen in the first episode = This Movie Sucks! = In 2010, after more than two years off the air, Ed returned to television on regional CHCH-TV in Hamilton with This Movie Sucks!, which was similar to his previous CityTV show Ed's Nite In. Kerzner relied on the use of student interns from nearby Mohawk College and the show was initially plagued with technical issues. The show was once again co-hosted by his wife Liana K and featured comedian Ron Sparks. In each two hour episode Ed has guests over to watch (and make fun of) a bad movie. This Movie Sucks! was named one of the five best television shows of 2010 by Toronto EntertainmentPhung, Wei. \\"Looking Back At All The Best of 2010\\", Toronto Entertainment, 27 December 2010 and one of the three best new shows of 2010 by Excalibur Magazine.Miller, Amy. \\"The Best New Shows of 2010\\", Excalibur Magazine, 6 January 2011The Best New Shows of 2010 A third season of This Movie Sucks! was reported to be in production but never materialized, with CHCH announcing that no future episode screenings were planned. = I Hate Hollywood = Produced concurrently with This Movie Sucks! on CHCH-TV was another Ed-hosted series called I Hate Hollywood, which Kerzner based on Fromage's style and template.CHCH expands programming for fall Media in Canada, July 27, 2010 (Article by Katie Bailey)CHCH-TV 'tweaks' format THE HAMILTON SPECTATOR, August 26, 2010 (Article by Steve Arnold) It was originally supposed to premiere in September 2010,Ed the Sock brings his wisecracks back to TV with new indie show on CHCH The Canadian Press, May 13, 2010 (Article by Bill Brioux) but was pushed back several times until it finally began airing on Wednesday nights, beginning May 2, 2012. The show, once again co-hosted by his wife Liana, made fun of the latest celebrity gossip and news but only lasted a few episodes before being canceled by the network.Ed The Sock Returning To Save Television CHARTattack, May 14, 2010 (Article by Kate Harper) Ed the Sock has not had a show on network TV since this show's cancellation by CHCH. = The Being Frank Show = Ed briefly became Frank D'Angelo's sidekick on The Being Frank Show in 2011-2012, which aired during late night infomercial slots purchased by host and beer entrepreneur Frank D'Angelo on CHCH-TV, the same network that aired This Movie Sucks! and I Hate Hollywood.  FU Network (2016)  After launching fundraisers beginning in 2015, in late 2016 Ed the Sock announced the FU Network, a video sharing website, from which he would share old and new clips. He also announced he would begin live streaming a new live weekly show from the entrance/lobby of the Hard Rock Cafe restaurant in downtown Toronto, Ontario called Live from Canada, It's Ed the Sock! The show was plagued by poor production values and technical difficulties. Audiences were usually a handful of people, and in return for letting them use his lobby as a broadcast location, the restaurant's manager would be given a segment of time to personally advertise available Hard Rock Cafe souvenirs such as hoodies and T-shirts. Although Ed announced the show would live stream every Thursday at 9pm, only five episodes aired between November 2016 and January 2017. On March 13 the Hard Rock Toronto announced it would be closing its doors. Ed announced in a CBC article about the closing that the FU Network would launch March 16, 2017, though it did not happen. The Hard Rock's doors closed its doors on May 31, 2017 making future shows from that location impossible. As of July 2019, no further episodes of Live from Canada have been streamed. In April 2017, Ed posted a video to his YouTube channel called \\"Who Murdered MuchMusic\\", documenting what he refers to is the demise and downfall of the Canadian music channel by pointing the finger at Bell Media and claiming that their behind the scenes management killed the station.Former TV Personality Ed The Sock Comes Under Fire Over Who Murdered MuchMusic Video Entertainment Tonight Canada, April 6th 2017 (Article by Rachel West) The video was pulled by YouTube after Bell Media complained about copyright infringement stemming from Kerzner's use of footage and logos owned by the company. Ed was unable to live stream on YouTube for 90 days because of this violation, but his video did remain live on Facebook. Ed raised funds through PayPal for a \\"legal war chest\\" to fight Bell. In July 2018, he launched an Indiegogo campaign to have the network officially launch online, promising to bring back old MuchMusic shows from the 1990s and early 2000s. Although his Indiegogo campaign failed to reach his goal of $35,000, Ed announced that he had met the goal through additional PayPal donations people had also made, and that the FU Network would launch as planned. The site was \\"under construction\\" through 2018 and pulled down entirely in early 2019 though Ed plans to relaunch it.  Controversies  = Night Party = Night Party aired in the late-night slot because of its overt depictions of sexuality, primarily involving sexualized, scantily clad (frequently topless) women and Ed's off-color remarks. The show was dismissed by many critics as nothing more than dirty \\"vaudeville schtick\\" overly relying on sex and bathroom jokes, with a \\"phallic in nature and attitude\\" host described as a \\"prurient party animal who feeds on his own misanthropy and sexism\\" and whose comedy, \\"vacillating between penetrating satire and pointless vulgarity\\" appealed only to \\"17 year old boys\\". Because of the crude, sexist humor, coarse language and nudity, a disclaimer had to preface the airing of every episode in the series' run. Complaints were filed with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council throughout the show's run because of the prevalent \\"sexism\\" and allegations the show was \\"derogatory to women\\", with some of those complaints upheld. A January, 2004 episode received criticism and complaints after Ed, Craig and Liana jokingly compared sex with women to stabbing women. In a further CBSC decision in March 2005 following a separate complaint, it was ruled that the viewer advisory screened before and during episodes of Night Party was insufficient under the CBA Code of Ethics and needed to be strengthened. Most infamously, following a stunt with a porn star named Doria in 1999, in which she stripped naked and pretended to have sex in \\"cowgirl\\" position with the Ed puppet on her hotel bed, many viewers complained and several stations dropped the show, including the entire province of Alberta where the show was banned for some time. = Triumph the Insult Comic Dog = Steve Kerzner has accused Triumph the Insult Comic Dog's creator Robert Smigel of ripping off Ed the Sock. The controversy dates back to 1997 when Kerzner claims Ed was set to appear on Late Night with Conan O'Brien but was suddenly cancelled, months before Smigel's Triumph debuted on that show.‚ÄúThis Movie Sucks‚Äù Discussion bureau42.com, July 11, 2010Is Triumph just a poor man's Ed the Sock?? Conan and NBC maintain that Ed was never even tentatively booked to appear on the show. Kerzner afterwards expressed such resentment towards Triumph and Smigel that NBC stated they \\"didn't want Ed anywhere near Triumph\\" when Conan visited Canada for a week of shows during February 2004,Ed the Sock Everything 2, Originally posted on June 19, 2008. Retrieved on May 4, 2011 with the Canadian network complying. When Smigel and Pets.com became embroiled in lawsuits over the Triumph and Pets.com dog puppet characters, Kerzner renewed his claims that Triumph had ripped him off. Kerzner claimed that he did not sue Smigel because \\"we don't want to give that dog that much attention.\\" =Other= In 2005, Kerzner's Ed's Night Party co- producer James Stamos was ejected from a Toronto Blue Jays game for wearing a shirt promoting the show that other fans complained was offensive. An usher asked him to turn the shirt inside out, but Stamos refused. After being announced as one of the 2007 Beaches Lions Club Easter Parade marshals, Ed the Sock was removed following dozens of complaints by concerned Beaches residents. The organizers determined Kerzner's act was \\"too raunchy for a community event\\" and replaced him with fellow Canadian comedian Luba Goy (of the Royal Canadian Air Farce comedy troupe). In 2020, Ed the Sock was criticized for what were described as racist comments concerning New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh. NDP MP Don Davies described Ed the Sock's use of \\"Jughead\\" to refer to Singh as \\"pure racism\\"; several Liberal MPs including Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Minister of Digital Government Joyce Murray condemned Ed the Sock's comments.  Inspirations  Ed's look has become more well defined over the years but is a basic sock puppet design very similar to any other, such as Shari Lewis' famous Lamb Chop and other sock puppet characters. Kerzner has claimed that Ed's voice is based on two actual people (non-celebrities), a friend's father and step-father, whose names remain undisclosed. However at other times he has said that Ed's voice is a combination of a ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs dad, Oscar the Grouch and Jack Klugman from The Odd Couple.‚Äù The name \\"Ed\\" was inspired by actor Ed Asner who Kerzner enjoyed watching in The Mary Tyler Moore Show and whose gruff voice is another inspiration for the puppet.  Other appearances  Despite being a vocal critic of Video on Trial and saying he would never appear on it because in his opinion it was never as good as Fromage, Ed was a guest on that show in 2013, 9 years after his days as a regular at MuchMusic had ended. It was supposed to be a chance for Ed to reach a \\"nationwide audience\\" again, and \\"expose Ed to a whole new generation.\\" Kerzner said Ed would be in the show's regular rotation of comedians after that, but he never appeared on the show again. Ed has made some radio appearancesEd The Sock Headlines This week‚Äôs edition of The Sports Guys January 21, 2011 and has guested at sci-fi conventions.

In 2011 Ed made several appearances as Frank D'Angelo's sidekick on The Being Frank Show, a paid infomercial program on CHCH-TV, the same network which formerly produced This Movie Sucks! and I Hate Hollywood. Kerzner also appeared as a stand-up comedian in his friend Frank D'Angelo's independent film The Joke Thief. In 2018 Ed appeared as a guest on the fourth episode of Quillettes Wrongspeak podcast. Ed has made several attempts to be asked to appear on the Juno Awards but has not been successful as of yet. He claims the Junos have a \\"grudge\\" against him.  FU Party  In 2010, Ed announced his intention to run for Prime Minister of Canada in the 2011 federal election as head of the new FU Party, a joke political party never registered with Elections Canada, which he claimed stood for \\"Fed-Up Party\\". The FU Party's stated goals included \\"fighting apathy and stupidity in government\\".Ed the Sock for Prime Minister - TV Legend announces new party to fight apathy & stupidity Ed the Sock Website, March 23, 2011. Retrieved March 29, 2011 Throughout the campaign the \\"FU Party News Centre\\" posted links to various articles and videos trying to encourage people to vote and criticizing the political establishment, especially the Conservative government and re-election campaign of Stephen Harper. Around this time, Ed also started his own WordPress blog called \\"Nobody's Puppet!\\" where he elaborated his thoughts on politics but also on the media industry. He searched for volunteer candidates to run in ridings across Canada, as well as a volunteer \\"Facebook expert\\" to help promote Ed and his party, until April, 2011. Although the Conservatives actually picked up 23 seats and the Liberals lost 43, Ed declared victory for the FU Party on April 28, 2011, claiming that he had successfully assailed apathy and taking credit for the record turnout at advance polls, although actual voter turnout ended up being only slightly higher than in 2008, which helped the governing Conservative Party to win a majority of seats.Low voter turnout Monday helps deliver Conservatives' coveted majority The Canadian Press, May 3, 2011 After the election Ed stated that the \\"Orange Surge\\" showed Canadians had learned that they have a choice. While not officially endorsing the New Democratic Party, Ed stated that the \\"NDP has become the FU vote\\". Ed also stated he hopes the FU Party will continue to provide \\"smartass commentary for a dumbass political establishment\\". In the 2015 election, Ed once again announced he was running for Prime Minister under the FU banner.

Subsequently, when the colonists were indignant about their perceived lack of representation and taxes such as the Stamp Act, the Sugar Act and the Tea Act, the colonists broke away from the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United States of America. \\"Radical Whig perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestant culture that had always verged on Puritanism.

Complexes: Oedipus and Electra In the Phallic stage of psychosexual development, a boy's decisive experience is the Oedipus complex describing his son‚Äìfather competition for sexual possession of mother. This psychological complex indirectly derives its name from the Greek mythologic character Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and sexually possessed his mother. Initially, Freud applied the Oedipus complex to the development of boys and girls alike; he then developed the female aspect of phallic-stage psychosexual development as the feminine Oedipus attitude and the negative Oedipus complex; but his student‚Äìcollaborator Carl Jung proposed the \\"Electra complex\\", derived from Greek mythologic character Electra, who plotted matricidal revenge against her mother for the murder of her father, to describe a girl's psychosexual competition with her mother for possession of her father.\\"Sigmund Freud 1856‚Äì1939\\" entry (2000) Encyclopaedia of German Literature Routledge:London Retrieved 2 September 2009: http://www.credoreference.com.library.capella.edu/entry/routgermanlit/sigmund_freud_1856_1939 = Oedipus = Oedipus complex: Oedipus and the Sphinx, by Gustave Moreau, 1864. Despite mother being the parent who primarily gratifies the child's desires, the child begins forming a discrete sexual identity ‚Äî \\"boy\\", \\"girl\\" ‚Äî that alters the dynamics of the parent and child relationship; the parents become the focus of infantile libidinal energy. The boy focuses his libido (sexual desire) upon his mother, and focuses jealousy and emotional rivalry against his father ‚Äî because it is he who sleeps with the mother. To facilitate uniting him with the mother, the boy's id wants to kill his father (as did Oedipus), but the ego, pragmatically based upon the reality principle, knows that his father is the stronger of the two males competing to psychosexually possess the one female. Nonetheless, the fearful boy remains ambivalent about his father's place in the family, which is manifested as fear of castration by the physically greater father; the fear is an irrational, subconscious manifestation of the infantile Id.Bullock, A., Trombley, S. (1999) The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought Harper Collins:London pp. 607, 705 =Electra= Electra complex: Electra at the Tomb of Agamemnon, by Frederic Leighton, c.1869 In developing a discrete psychosexual identity, boys develop castration anxiety and girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl's envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands, resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father. She thus psychosexually progresses to heterosexual femininity (which culminates in bearing a child) derived from earlier, infantile desires; her child replaces the absent penis. Moreover, after the phallic stage, the girl's psychosexual development includes transferring her primary erogenous zone from the infantile clitoris to the adult vagina. Freud thus considered a girl's Oedipal conflict to be more emotionally intense than that of a boy, resulting, potentially, in a woman of submissive, less confident personality.Bullock, A., Trombley, S. (1999) The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought Harper Collins:London pp. 259, 705 Defense mechanisms In both sexes, defense mechanisms provide transitory resolutions of the conflict between the drives of the Id and the drives of the Ego. The first defense mechanism is repression, the blocking of memories, emotional impulses, and ideas from the conscious mind; yet it does not resolve the Id‚ÄìEgo conflict. The second defense mechanism is identification, by which the child incorporates, to his or her ego, the personality characteristics of the same-sex parent; in so adapting, the boy diminishes his castration anxiety, because likeness to father protects him from father's wrath as a rival for mother; by so adapting, the girl facilitates identifying with mother, who understands that, in being females, neither of them possesses a penis, and thus are not antagonists.Bullock, A., Trombley, S.

His most important work, Heydar Babaya Salam is considered to be the pinnacle in Azerbaijani literature which gained great popularity in the Turkic world and was translated to more than 30 languages. Contrary to many other figures of his time, Shahriar barely involved himself with political problems and ideologies. He was, however, known for his avid nationalism; in his work, numerous metaphors commending Persepolis, Zoroaster and Ferdowsi are made.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shahryar-mohammad Biography Mohammad Hossein Shahriar was one of the first Azerbaijanis of Iran to write a significant collection of poetry in the Azerbaijani language. Born in 1906 in Tabriz, he received his elementary education, including the Divan of Hafez, under his father's supervision. Shahriar‚Äôs first formal education was at the Motahari (former Mansoor High School) Secondary School in Tabriz. He subsequently studied at the Dar-ol-Fonoun (former higher education school) in Tehran. Although he studied medicine in college, he dropped out just before getting his diploma and went to Khorasan, where he found a job as a notary public and bank clerk. He returned to Tehran in 1935 and started working in the Agricultural Bank of Iran. He also received an honorary Ph.D. degree from University of Tabriz in Literature. He initially published his poems under his given name, Behjat, but later chose the name Shahriar. He published his first book of poems in 1929. His poems are mainly influenced by Hafez, a famous Persian poet, and Khasta Qasim, an old Azerbaijani poet. His most famous work in Azerbaijani is Heydar Babaya Salam, published in 1954, which won immense popularity and has been translated into more than 30 languages and numerous plays all over the world. Works The poet began by composing tragic poetry. Many of his bittersweet memories are reflected in his books Hazyan-e Del, Heydar Baba, and Mumiyai. Heydar Baba, composed in Azeri and later translated into Persian, was for a long time on the top ten best-seller list in Tehran. Heydar Baba is the name of a mountain where the poet spent his childhood. He also wrote a book of epic poems, Takht-e Jamshid. He was interested in humanistic issues and in his poem \\"A letter to Einstein\\" he criticized the result of his scientific work that was abused as the nuclear weapon. Shahriar‚Äôs verse takes diverse forms, including lyrics, quatrains, couplets, odes, and elegies. One of his love poems, Hala Chera, was set to music by Rouhollah Khaleghi. The composition for orchestra and solo voice became one of his most well-known works. One of the major reasons for the success of Shahriar‚Äôs work is the sincerity of his words. Since he uses slang and colloquial language in the context of poetry, his poems are understandable and effective for a broad segment of the public. Shahriar was a talented calligrapher, played the setar very well, and had a keen interest in music. He was a very close friend of the Persian musician and highly respected teacher, Abdulhossein Saba. Death Shahriar tomb in Maqbaratoshoara His day of death is named the \\"national day of poem\\" in Iran. A television series about his life, directed by Kamal Tabrizi, aired on IRIB channel 2. He died on 18 September 1988 in one of the Tehran's hospitals and his body was transferred to Tabriz and was buried in Maqbaratoshoara (Tombs of Poets).

Meyers (ed.), Computational Complexity: Theory, Techniques, and Applications, pp. 185-203, Springer, 2012.P. Dittrich, J. Ziegler, and W. Banzhaf. Artificial chemistries ‚Äî A review. Artificial Life, 7(3):225‚Äì275, 2001. is a chemical-like system that usually consists of objects, called molecules, that interact according to rules resembling chemical reaction rules. Artificial chemistries are created and studied in order to understand fundamental properties of chemical systems, including prebiotic evolution, as well as for developing chemical computing systems. Artificial chemistry is a field within computer science wherein chemical reactions‚Äîoften biochemical ones‚Äîare computer-simulated, yielding insights on evolution, self-assembly, and other biochemical phenomena. The field does not use actual chemicals, and should not be confused with either synthetic chemistry or computational chemistry. Rather, bits of information are used to represent the starting molecules, and the end products are examined along with the processes that led to them. The field originated in artificial life but has shown to be a versatile method with applications in many fields such as chemistry, economics, sociology and linguistics. Formal definition An artificial chemistry is defined in general as a triple (S,R,A). In some cases it is sufficient to define it as a tuple (S,I). *S is the set of possible molecules S={s1...,sn}, where n is the number of elements in the set, possibly infinite. *R is a set of n-ary operations on the molecules in S, the reaction rules R={r1...,rn}. Each rule ri is written like a chemical reaction a+b+c->a*+b*+c*. Note here that ri are operators, as opposed to +. *A is an algorithm describing how to apply the rules R to a subset P\\\\subsetS. *I are the interaction rules of the molecules in S. Types of artificial chemistries * depending on the space of possible molecules ** finite ** infinite * depending on the type of reactions ** catalytic systems ** reactive systems ** inhibitive systems * depending on the space topology ** well stirred reactor ** topologically arranged (1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional) Important concepts * The field is heavily reliant on mathematics, to include mathematical modeling. It in fact relies more on a mathematics background than a chemistry background. * Organizations: An organization is a set of molecules that is closed and self-maintaining. As such, it is a set that does not create anything outside itself, and such that any molecule inside the set can be generated within the set. * Closed sets * Self- maintaining sets * Hasse diagram of organizations History of artificial chemistries Artificial chemistries emerged as a sub-field of artificial life, in particular from strong artificial life. The idea behind this field was that if one wanted to build something alive, it had to be done by a combination of non-living entities. For instance, a cell is itself alive, and yet is a combination of non-living molecules. Artificial chemistry enlists, among others, researchers that believe in an extreme bottom-up approach to artificial life. In artificial life, bits of information were used to represent bacteria or members of a species, each of which moved, multiplied, or died in computer simulations. In artificial chemistry bits of information are used to represent starting molecules capable of reacting with one another. The field has pertained to artificial intelligence by virtue of the fact that, over billions of years, non-living matter evolved into primordial life forms which in turn evolved into intelligent life forms.

In Germany, it was Wolfgang Banzhaf, who, together with his students Peter Dittrich and Jens Ziegler, developed various artificial chemistry models. Their 2001 paper 'Artificial Chemistries - A Review' became a standard in the field. Jens Ziegler, as part of his PhD thesis, proved that an artificial chemistry could be used to control a small Khepera robot .J.Ziegler and W.Banzhaf. Evolving control metabolisms for a robot. ArtificialLife, 7(2):171‚Äì190, 2001. Among other models, Peter Dittrich developed the Seceder model which is able to explain group formation in society through some simple rules. Since then he became a professor in Jena where he investigates artificial chemistries as a way to define a general theory of constructive dynamical systems. Applications of artificial chemistries Artificial Chemistries are often used in the study of protobiology, in trying to bridge the gap between chemistry and biology. A further motivation to study artificial chemistries is the interest in constructive dynamical systems. Yasuhiro Suzuki has modeled various systems such as membrane systems, signaling pathways (P53), ecosystems, and enzyme systems by using his method, abstract rewriting system on multisets (ARMS). Artificial chemistry in popular culture In the 1994 science-fiction novel Permutation City by Greg Egan, brain-scanned emulated humans known as Copies inhabit a simulated world which includes the Autoverse, an artificial life simulator based on a cellular automaton complex enough to represent the substratum of an artificial chemistry. Tiny environments are simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, Autobacterium lamberti. The purpose of the Autoverse is to allow Copies to explore the life that had evolved there after it had been run on a significantly large segment of the simulated universe (referred to as \\"Planet Lambert\\").

Sodium fluorescein is added into the systemic circulation, the retina is illuminated with blue light at a wavelength of 490 nanometers, and an angiogram is obtained by photographing the fluorescent green light that is emitted by the dye. The fluorescein is administered intravenously in intravenous fluorescein angiography (IVFA) and orally in oral fluorescein angiography (OFA). The test is a dye tracing method. The fluorescein dye also reappears in the patient urine, causing the urine to appear darker, and sometimes orange. It can also cause discolouration of the saliva. Fluorescein angiography is one of several health care applications of this dye, all of which have a risk of severe adverse effects. See fluorescein safety in health care applications. Fluorescein angiography does not involve the use of ionizing radiation. Fluorescein angiography was pioneered by German ophthalmologist Achim Wessing, who published his findings in 1969. Equipment * Exciter filter: Allows only blue light to illuminate the retina. Depending on the specific filter, the excitation wavelength hitting the retina will be between 465 and 490 nm. Most only allow light through at a wavelength of 490 nm. * Barrier filter: Allows only yellow-green light (from the fluorescence) to reach the camera. Both filters are interference bandpass filters, which means they block out all light except that at a specific wavelength. The barrier filter only allows light with a wavelength of 525 nm, but depending on the filter it can be anywhere from 520‚Äì530 nm. * Fundus camera, either digital or with camera body containing black and white, or slide positive film. Technique * Baseline color and black and white red- free filtered images are taken prior to injection. The black and white images are filtered red-free (a green filter) to increase contrast and often gives a better image of the fundus than the color image. * A 6-second bolus injection of 2-5 cc of sodium fluorescein into a vein in the arm or hand * A series of black-and-white or digital photographs are taken of the retina before and after the fluorescein reaches the retinal circulation (approximately 10 seconds after injection). The early images allow for the recognition of autofluorescence of the retinal tissues. Photos are taken approximately once every second for about 20 seconds, then less often. A delayed image is obtained at 5 and 10 minutes. Some doctors like to see a 15-minute image as well. * A filter is placed in the camera so only the fluorescent, yellow-green light (530 nm) is recorded. The camera may however pick up signals from pseudofluorescence or autofluorescence. In pseudofluorescence, non-fluorescent light is imaged. This occurs when blue light reflected from the retina passes through the filter. This is generally a problem with older filters, and annual replacement of these filters is recommended. In autofluorescence, fluorescence from the eye occurs without injection of the dye. This may be seen with optic nerve head drusen, astrocytic hamartoma, or calcific scarring. * Black-and- white photos give better contrast than color photos, which aren't necessary because the filter transmits only one color of light. Normal circulatory filling times are approximate * 0 seconds ‚Äì injection of fluorescein * 9.5 sec ‚Äì posterior ciliary arteries * 10 sec ‚Äì choroidal flush (or \\"pre-arterial phase\\") * 10‚Äì12 sec ‚Äì retinal arterial stage * 13 sec ‚Äì capillary transition stage * 14‚Äì15 sec ‚Äì early venous stage (or \\"laminar stage\\", \\"arterial-venous stage\\") * 16‚Äì17 sec ‚Äì venous stage * 18‚Äì20 sec ‚Äì late venous stage * 5 minutes ‚Äì late staining Fluorescein enters the ocular circulation from the internal carotid artery via the ophthalmic artery. The ophthalmic artery supplies the choroid via the short posterior ciliary arteries and the retina via the central retinal artery, but the route to the choroid is typically less circuitous than the route to the retina. This accounts for the short delay between the \\"choroidal flush\\" and retinal filling. Pathologic findings Pathologic changes are recognized by the detection of either hyperfluorescence or hypofluorescence. Causes of hyperfluorescence: :window/transmission (filling) defects :leaking defects (i.e. capillary leakage, aneurysm, neovascularization) :pooling defects :staining :abnormal vasculature Causes of hypofluorescence: :blocking defect (i.e. blood) :filling defect (capillary nonperfusion/blockage) Fluorescein angiography is used by physicians specializing in the treatment of eye diseases (ophthalmologists) to evaluate the vasculature of the retina, choroid, optic disc, and iris. Among the common groups of ophthalmologic disease, fluorescein angiography can detect diabetic retinopathy (neovascularization), vein occlusions, retinal artery occlusions, edema of the optic disc, and tumors. Additionally, the transit time (the period between injection of the dye and when it appears in the examined blood vessels) can provide an objective measurement of the rate of blood flow through the imaged blood vessels.

He composed it in Vienna in 1782 and 1783 after his marriage when he moved to Vienna from Salzburg. This large-scale work, a missa solemnis, is scored for two soprano soloists, a tenor and a bass, double chorus and large orchestra. It remained unfinished, missing large portions of the Credo and the complete Agnus Dei. Composition and first performance The work was composed during 1782/83. In a letter to his father Leopold dated 4 January 1783, Mozart mentioned a vow he had made to write a mass when he would bring his then fianc√©e Constanze as his wife to Salzburg to meet his family for the first time after his father's earlier opposition. Constanze then sang the \\"Et incarnatus est\\" at its premiere. The first performance took place in Salzburg on Sunday 26 October 1783 (the twentieth Sunday after Pentecost). Mozart had moved to Vienna in 1781, but was paying a visit to his home town in the company of Constanze, who had not yet met his father or his sister (Nannerl). The performance consisted of just the Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus and Benedictus, as surviving parts and a score copy from ca. 1800 show. It took place in the Church of St. Peter's Abbey in the context of a Roman Catholic mass. Mozart's sister's diary mentions that the performers were the entire , that is the musicians employed at the court of Salzburg's ruler, Prince-Archbishop Count Hieronymus von Colloredo and thus Mozart's former colleagues. There was a rehearsal in the nearby Kapellhaus on 23 October 1783. Fragmentary status The work is incomplete, missing the Credo movements following the aria Et incarnatus est (the orchestration of the only two surviving Credo movements being incomplete) and all of the Agnus Dei. The Sanctus is partially lost and requires editorial reconstruction. The Benedictus only survives in the above-mentioned score copy. There is a good deal of speculation concerning why the work was left unfinished. For purposes of modern performances, the editions and completions available are those by Alois Schmitt (1901, Breitkopf & H√§rtel), H. C. Robbins Landon (1956, Eulenburg), Helmut Eder (1985, B√§renreiter), Franz Beyer (1989, Amadeus/Edition Peters), Richard Maunder (1990, Oxford University Press/Carus Verlag), Philip Wilby (2004, Novello), Robert Levin (2005, Carus-Verlag), Clemens Kemme (2018, Breitkopf & H√§rtel), and Ulrich Leisinger (2019, B√§renreiter). The editions by Landon, Eder, Beyer, Maunder and Kemme aim to simply fill out the missing orchestrations and choral parts in the Credo and Sanctus, whereas the editions by Schmitt, Wilby and Levin aim to complete the work by either using movements from other masses or composing new music for the Credo and Agnus Dei through the use of parody or elaboration of period sketches by Mozart. Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs (Musikproduktion H√∂flich) just offers a complete Credo and an Agnus Dei. For the Credo this means a completions of the 'Credo in unum Deum' and the 'Et incarnatus est' and additional music for the rest of the Credo. This edition, therefore, is intended to be used in combination with any other version of the Mass. Robert Xavier Rodriguez has also completed the Agnus Dei.\\"Robert Xavier Rodr√≠guez: Agnus Dei (completion of Mozart's Mass in C minor), G. Schirmer Inc.

The importance lies less in the pattern of land use predicted than in its analytical approach. Th√ºnen developed the basics of the theory of marginal productivity in a mathematically rigorous way, summarizing it in the formula in which :R = Y(p - c) - YFm \\\\, where R = land rent; Y = yield per unit of land; c = production expenses per unit of commodity; p=market price per unit of commodity; F = freight rate (per agricultural unit, per mile); m=distance to market. Th√ºnen's model of agricultural land, created before industrialization, made the following simplifying assumptions: * The city is located centrally within an \\"Isolated State.\\" * The Isolated State is surrounded by wilderness. * The land is completely flat and has no rivers or mountains. * Soil quality and climate are consistent. * Farmers in the Isolated State transport their own goods to market via oxcart, across land, directly to the central city. There are no roads. * Farmers behave rationally to maximize profits. The use which a piece of land is put to is a function of the cost of transport to market and the land rent a farmer can afford to pay (determined by yield, which is held constant here). The model generated four concentric rings of agricultural activity. Dairying and intensive farming lies closest to the city. Since vegetables, fruit, milk and other dairy products must get to market quickly, they would be produced close to the city. Timber and firewood would be produced for fuel and building materials in the second ring. Wood was a very important fuel for heating and cooking and is very heavy and difficult to transport so it is located close to the city. The third zone consists of extensive fields crops such as grain. Since grains last longer than dairy products and are much lighter than fuel, reducing transport costs, they can be located further from the city. Ranching is located in the final ring. Animals can be raised far from the city because they are self-transporting. Animals can walk to the central city for sale or for butchering. Beyond the fourth ring lies the wilderness, which is too great a distance from the central city for any type of agricultural product. Th√ºnen's rings proved especially useful to economic history, such as Fernand Braudel's Civilization and Capitalism, untangling the economic history of Europe and European colonialism before the Industrial Revolution blurred the patterns on the ground. In economics, Th√ºnen rent is an economic rent created by spatial variation or location of a resource. It is 'that which can be earned above that which can be earned at the margin of production'. = Natural wage = In the second volume of his great work, The Isolated State, Thunen developed some of the mathematical foundations of marginal productivity theory and wrote about the Natural Wage indicated by the formula , in which equals the value of the product of labor and capital, and equals the subsistence of the laborer and their family. The idea he presented is that a surplus will arise on the earlier units of an investment of either capital or labor, but as time goes on the diminishing return of newer investments will mean that if wages vary with the level of productivity those that are early will receive a greater reward for their labor and capital. But if wage rates were determined using his formula, thus giving labor a share that will vary as the square root of the joint product of the two factors, and . This formula was so important to him that it was a dying wish of his that it be placed on his tombstone. In The Isolated State he also coined the term Grenzkosten (marginal cost) which would later be popularized by Alfred Marshall in his Principles of Economics.

One of his assignments was to photograph the entire Demilitarized Zone from end to end immediately following the war. This took him over a month to complete. =Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning photograph= left It was while covering the Vietnam War for the Associated Press that he took his best-known photograph‚Äîthat of police chief General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan, summarily executing Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√©m, a Vietcong prisoner. This took place on a Saigon street on February 1, 1968, during the opening stages of the Tet Offensive. Adams won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and a World Press Photo award for the photograph. Writer and critic David D. Perlmutter points out that \\"no film footage did as much damage as AP photographer Eddie Adams's 35mm shot taken on a Saigon street ... When people talk or write about [the Tet Offensive] at least a sentence is devoted (often with an illustration) to the Eddie Adams picture\\". Anticipating the impact of Adams's photograph, an attempt at balance was sought by editors at The New York Times. In his memoirs, John G. Morris recalls that assistant managing editor Theodore M. Bernstein \\"determined that the brutality manifested by America's ally be put into perspective, agreed to run the Adams picture large, but offset with a picture of a child slain by Vietcong, which conveniently came through from AP at about the same time.\\" Nonetheless, it is Adams's photograph that is remembered while the other image was overlooked and soon forgotten. In Regarding the Pain of Others (2003), Susan Sontag was disturbed by what she saw as Loan's staging of the execution in the street for journalists' photographs. She wrote that \\"he would not have carried out the summary execution there had they [journalists] not been available to witness it\\" and positioned himself in profile view with the prisoner facing the cameras. However, Donald Winslow of The New York Times quoted Adams as having described the image as a \\"reflex picture\\" and \\"wasn't certain of what he'd photographed until the film was developed\\". Furthermore, Winslow noted that Adams \\"wanted me to understand that 'Saigon Execution' was not his most important picture and that he did not want his obituary to begin, 'Eddie Adams, the photographer best known for his iconic Vietnam photograph 'Saigon Execution. Adams would later lament the impact of the photo. On Loan and his photograph, Adams wrote in Time in 1998: Loan moved to the United States, and in 1978, there was an unsuccessful attempt to rescind his permanent residence status (green card). Adams advocated for Loan when the U.S. government sought to deport him based on the photograph, and apologized in person to Loan and his family for the irreparable damage it did to his honor while he was alive. When Loan died, Adams praised him as a \\"hero\\" of a \\"just cause\\".Image Canon ‚Äì Historic Images On the television show War Stories with Oliver North Adams referred to Loan as \\"a goddamned hero!\\" He once said, \\"I would have rather been known more for the series of photographs I shot of 48 Vietnamese refugees who managed to sail to Thailand in a 30-foot boat, only to be towed back to the open seas by Thai marines.\\" The photographs, and accompanying reports, helped persuade then President Jimmy Carter to grant the nearly 200,000 Vietnamese boat people asylum. He won the Robert Capa Gold Medal from the Overseas Press Club in 1977 for this series of photographs in his photo-essay, \\"The Boat of No Smiles\\" (published by AP).The OPC's Robert Capa Gold Medal Adams remarked, \\"It did some good and nobody got hurt.\\" On October 22, 2009 Swann Galleries auctioned a print of Adams' photo of Loan and L√©m.

Starting in 1960, it ran on the University of Illinois' ILLIAC I computer. By the late 1970s, it supported several thousand graphics terminals distributed worldwide, running on nearly a dozen different networked mainframe computers. Many modern concepts in multi- user computing were originally developed on PLATO, including forums, message boards, online testing, e-mail, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multiplayer video games. PLATO was designed and built by the University of Illinois and functioned for four decades, offering coursework (elementary through university) to UIUC students, local schools, prison inmates, and other universities. Courses were taught in a range of subjects, including Latin, chemistry, education, music, and primary mathematics. The system included a number of features useful for pedagogy, including text overlaying graphics, contextual assessment of free-text answers, depending on the inclusion of keywords, and feedback designed to respond to alternative answers. Rights to market PLATO as a commercial product were licensed by Control Data Corporation (CDC), the manufacturer on whose mainframe computers the PLATO IV system was built. CDC President William Norris planned to make PLATO a force in the computer world, but found that marketing the system was not as easy as hoped. PLATO nevertheless built a strong following in certain markets, and the last production PLATO system did not shut down until 2006, coincidentally just a month after Norris died.

History  =Impetus = Before the 1944 G.I. Bill that provided free college education to World War II veterans, higher education was limited to a minority of the US population, though only 9% of the population was in the military. The trend towards greater enrollment was notable by the early 1950s, and the problem of providing instruction for the many new students was a serious concern to university administrators. To wit, if computerized automation increased factory production, it could do the same for academic instruction. The USSR's 1957 launching of the Sputnik I artificial satellite energized the United States' government into spending more on science and engineering education. In 1958, the U.S. Air Force's Office of Scientific Research had a conference about the topic of computer instruction at the University of Pennsylvania; interested parties, notably IBM, presented studies. = Genesis = Around 1959 Chalmers W. Sherwin, a physicist at the University of Illinois (U of I), suggested a computerised learning system to William Everett, the engineering college dean, who, in turn, recommended that Daniel Alpert, another physicist, convene a meeting about the matter with engineers, administrators, mathematicians, and psychologists. After weeks of meetings they were unable to agree on a single design. Before conceding failure, Alpert mentioned the matter to laboratory assistant Donald Bitzer, who had been thinking about the problem, suggesting he could build a demonstration system. Bitzer, regarded as the Father of PLATO, recognized that in order to provide quality computer-based education, good graphics were critical. This at a time when 10-character-per-second teleprinters were the norm. In 1960, the first system, PLATO I, operated on the local ILLIAC I computer. It included a television set for display and a special keyboard for navigating the system's function menus; PLATO II, in 1961, featured two users at once.Two users limit was caused by ILLIAC memory limitation, program could handle more users (pp. 19, 23). * The PLATO system was re-designed, between 1963 and 1969; * PLATO III allowed \\"anyone\\" to design new lesson modules using their TUTOR programming language, conceived in 1967 by biology graduate student Paul Tenczar. Built on a CDC 1604, given to them by William Norris, PLATO III could simultaneously run up to 20 terminals, and was used by local facilities in Champaign‚ÄìUrbana that could enter the system with their custom terminals. The only remote PLATO III terminal was located near the state capitol in Springfield, Illinois at Springfield High School. It was connected to the PLATO III system by a video connection and a separate dedicated line for keyboard data. PLATO I, II, and III were funded by small grants from a combined Army-Navy-Air Force funding pool. By the time PLATO III was in operation, everyone involved was convinced it was worthwhile to scale up the project. Accordingly, in 1967, the National Science Foundation granted the team steady funding, allowing Alpert to set up the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (CERL) at the University of Illinois Urbana‚ÄìChampaign campus. The system was capable of supporting 20 time-sharing terminals. = The first multimedia experiences (PLATO IV) = In 1972, with the introduction of PLATO IV, Bitzer declared general success, claiming that the goal of generalized computer instruction was now available to all. However, the terminals were very expensive (about $12,000). The PLATO IV terminal had several major innovations: _Plasma Display Screen_ : Bitzer's orange plasma display, incorporated both memory and bitmapped graphics into one display. The display was a 512√ó512 bitmap, with both character and vector plotting done by hardwired logic. It included fast vector line drawing capability, and ran at 1260 baud, rendering 60 lines or 180 characters per second. . Users could provide their own characters to support rudimentary bitmap graphics. _Touch panel_ : A 16√ó16 grid infrared touch panel, allowing students to answer questions by touching anywhere on the screen. _Microfiche images_ : Compressed air powered a piston-driven microfiche image selector that permitted colored images to be projected on the back of the screen under program control. _A hard drive for Audio snippets_ : The random-access audio device used a magnetic disc with a capacity to hold 17 total minutes of pre- recorded audio. It could retrieve for playback any of 4096 audio clips within 0.4 seconds. By 1980, the device was being commercially produced by Education and Information Systems, Incorporated with a capacity of just over 22 minutes. keyboard for a PLATO IV terminal, circa 1976. _A Votrax voice synthesizer_ _The Gooch Synthetic Woodwind_ (named after inventor Sherwin Gooch), a synthesizer that offered four-voice music synthesis to provide sound in PLATO courseware. This was later supplanted on the PLATO V terminal by the Gooch Cybernetic Synthesizer, which had sixteen voices that could be programmed individually, or combined to make more complex sounds. = The ideas started to spread into industry = Early in 1972, researchers from Xerox PARC were given a tour of the PLATO system at the University of Illinois. At this time, they were shown parts of the system, such as the Show Display application generator for pictures on PLATO (later translated into a graphics-draw program on the Xerox Star workstation), the Charset Editor for \\"painting\\" new characters (later translated into a \\"Doodle\\" program at PARC), and the Term Talk and Monitor Mode communications programs. Many of the new technologies they saw were adopted and improved upon, when these researchers returned to Palo Alto, California. They subsequently transferred improved versions of this technology to Apple Inc.. = The CDC years = As PLATO IV reached production quality, William Norris (CDC) became increasingly interested in it as a potential product. His interest was twofold. From a strict business perspective, he was evolving Control Data into a service-based company instead of a hardware one, and was increasingly convinced that computer-based education would become a major market in the future. At the same time, Norris was troubled by the unrest of the late 1960s, and felt that much of it was due to social inequalities that needed to be addressed. PLATO offered a solution by providing higher education to segments of the population that would otherwise never be able to afford a university education. Norris provided CERL with machines on which to develop their system in the late 1960s. In 1971, he set up a new division within CDC to develop PLATO \\"courseware\\", and eventually many of CDC's own initial training and technical manuals ran on it. In 1974, PLATO was running on in-house machines at CDC headquarters in Minneapolis, and in 1976, they purchased the commercial rights in exchange for a new CDC Cyber machine. Using the CDC Plato network, circa 1979-1980, with an IST-II terminal CDC announced the acquisition soon after, claiming that by 1985, 50% of the company's income would be related to PLATO services. Through the 1970s, CDC tirelessly promoted PLATO, both as a commercial tool and one for re-training unemployed workers in new fields. Norris refused to give up on the system, and invested in several non-mainstream courses, including a crop-information system for farmers, and various courses for inner-city youth. CDC even went as far as to place PLATO terminals in some shareholder's houses, to demonstrate the concept of the system. In the early 1980s, CDC started heavily advertising the service, apparently due to increasing internal dissent over the now $600 million project, taking out print and even radio ads promoting it as a general tool. The Minneapolis Tribune was unconvinced by their ad copy and started an investigation of the claims. In the end, they concluded that while it was not proven to be a better education system, everyone using it nevertheless enjoyed it, at least. An official evaluation by an external testing agency ended with roughly the same conclusions, suggesting that everyone enjoyed using it, but it was essentially equal to an average human teacher in terms of student advancement. Of course, a computerized system equal to a human should have been a major achievement, the very concept for which the early pioneers in CBT were aiming. A computer could serve all the students in a school for the cost of maintaining it, and wouldn't go on strike. However, CDC charged $50 an hour for access to their data center, in order to recoup some of their development costs, making it considerably more expensive than a human on a per-student basis. PLATO was, therefore, a failure in any real sense, although it did find some use in large companies and government agencies willing to invest in the technology. An attempt to mass-market the PLATO system was introduced in 1980 as Micro-PLATO, which ran the basic TUTOR system on a CDC \\"Viking-721\\"https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/CDC_Viking_721 terminal and various home computers. Versions were built for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, Atari 8-bit family, Zenith Z-100 and, later, Radio Shack TRS-80 and IBM Personal Computer. Micro-PLATO could be used stand-alone for normal courses, or could connect to a CDC data center for multiuser programs. To make the latter affordable, CDC introduced the Homelink service for $5 an hour. Norris continued to praise PLATO, announcing that it would be only a few years before it represented a major source of income for CDC as late as 1984. In 1986, Norris stepped down as CEO, and the PLATO service was slowly killed off. He later claimed that Micro-PLATO was one of the reasons PLATO got off-track. They had started on the TI-99/4A, but then Texas Instruments pulled the plug and they moved to other systems like the Atari, who soon did the same. He felt that it was a waste of time anyway, as the system's value was in its online nature, which Micro-PLATO lacked initially. Bitzer was more forthright about CDC's failure, blaming their corporate culture for the problems. He noted that development of the courseware was averaging $300,000 per delivery hour, many times what the CERL was paying for similar products. This meant that CDC had to charge high prices in order to recoup their costs, prices that made the system unattractive. The reason, he suggested, for these high prices was that CDC had set up a division that had to keep itself profitable via courseware development, forcing them to raise the prices in order to keep their headcount up during slow periods. = The multi-media capabilities were extended in several dimensions = A PLATO V terminal in 1981, displaying RankTrek application, one of the first to combine simultaneous local microprocessor- based computing with remote mainframe computing. The monochromatic plasma display's characteristic orange glow is illustrated. Infrared sensors mounted around the display watch for a user's touch screen input. Intel 8080 microprocessors were introduced in the new PLATO V terminals. They could download small software modules and execute them locally. It was a way to augment the PLATO courseware with rich animation and other sophisticated capabilities.The Plato V Terminal, J. E. Stifle, CERL Report X-50, August 1977. [Missing: The use of Laser Discs to teach Physics and Chemistry.]  Online community  Although PLATO was designed for computer-based education, perhaps its most enduring legacy is its place in the origins of online community. This was made possible by PLATO's groundbreaking communication and interface capabilities, features whose significance is only lately being recognized by computer historians. PLATO Notes, created by David R. Woolley in 1973, was among the world's first online message boards, and years later became the direct progenitor of Lotus Notes. By 1976, PLATO had sprouted a variety of novel tools for online communication, including Personal Notes (email), Talkomatic (chat rooms), Term-Talk (instant messaging), monitor mode (remote screen sharing) and emoticons. PLATO's plasma panels were well suited to games, although its I/O bandwidth (180 characters per second or 60 graphic lines per second) was relatively slow. By virtue of 1500 shared 60-bit variables per game (initially), it was possible to implement online games. Because it was an educational computer system, most of the user community were keenly interested in games. In much the same way that the PLATO hardware and development platform inspired advances elsewhere (such as at Xerox PARC and MIT), many popular commercial and Internet games ultimately derived their inspiration from PLATO's early games. As one example, Castle Wolfenstein by PLATO alum Silas Warner was inspired by PLATO's dungeon games (see below), in turn inspiring Doom and Quake. Thousands of multiplayer online games were developed on PLATO from around 1970 through the 1980s, with the following notable examples: * Daleske's Empire (a top-view multiplayer space game based on Star Trek. Either Empire or Colley's Maze War is the first networked multiplayer action game. It was ported to Trek82, Trek83, ROBOTREK, Xtrek, and Netrek, and also adapted (without permission) for the Apple II computer by fellow PLATO alum Robert Woodhead (of Wizardry fame), as a game called Galactic Attack. * The original Freecell by Alfille (from Baker's concept). * Fortner's Airfight, probably the direct inspiration for (PLATO alum) Bruce Artwick's Microsoft Flight Simulator. * Haefeli and Bridwell's Panther (a vector graphics-based tankwar game, anticipating Atari's BattleZone). * Many other first-person shooters, most notably Bowery's Spasim and Witz and Boland's Futurewar, believed to be the first FPS. * Countless games inspired by the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, including the original Rutherford/Whisenhunt and Wood dnd (later ported to the PDP-10/11 by Lawrence, who earlier had visited PLATO). dnd is believed to be the first dungeon crawl game and was followed by: Moria, Rogue, Dry Gulch (a western-style variation), and Bugs-n-Drugs (a medical variation)‚Äîall presaging MUDs (Multi-User Domains) and MOOs (MUDs, Object Oriented) as well as popular first-person shooters like Doom and Quake, and MMORPGs (Massively multiplayer online role-playing game) like EverQuest and World of Warcraft. Avatar, PLATO's most popular game, is one of the world's first MUDs and has over 1 million hours of use.. The games Doom and Quake can trace part of their lineage back to PLATO programmer Silas Warner. PLATO's communication tools and games formed the basis for an online community of thousands of PLATO users, which lasted for well over twenty years.. PLATO's games became so popular that a program called \\"The Enforcer\\" was written to run as a background process to regulate or disable game play at most sites and times ‚Äì a precursor to parental-style control systems that regulate access based on content rather than security considerations. In September 2006 the Federal Aviation Administration retired its PLATO system, the last system that ran the PLATO software system on a CDC Cyber mainframe, from active duty. Existing PLATO-like systems now include NovaNET. and Cyber1.org. By early 1976, the original PLATO IV system had 950 terminals giving access to more than 3500 contact hours of courseware, and additional systems were in operation at CDC and Florida State University. Eventually, over 12,000 contact hours of courseware was developed, much of it developed by university faculty for higher education. PLATO courseware covers a full range of high-school and college courses, as well as topics such as reading skills, family planning, Lamaze training and home budgeting. In addition, authors at the University of Illinois School of Basic Medical Sciences (now, the University of Illinois College of Medicine) devised a large number of basic science lessons and a self-testing system for first-year students.. However the most popular \\"courseware\\" remained their multi-user games and role-playing video games such as dnd, although it appears CDC was uninterested in this market. As the value of a CDC-based solution disappeared in the 1980s, interested educators ported the engine first to the IBM PC, and later to web- based systems.  Custom Character Sets  In the early 1970s, some people working in the modern foreign languages group at the University of Illinois began working on a set of Hebrew lessons, originally without good system support for leftward writing. In preparation for a PLATO demo in Teheran, that Bruce Sherwood would participate in, Sherwood worked with Don Lee to implement support for leftward writing, including Persian (Farsi), for which the writing system is based on that of Arabic. There was no funding for this work, which was undertaken only due to Sherwood's personal interest, and no curriculum development occurred for either Persian or Arabic. However, Peter Cole, Robert Lebowitz, and Robert Hart used the new system capabilities to re-do the Hebrew lessons. The PLATO hardware and software supported the design and use of one's own 8-by-16 characters, so most languages could be displayed on the graphics screen (including those written right-to-left).  University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project (Technology and Research-based Chronology)  A PLATO-compatible music language known as OPAL (Octave-Pitch-Accent-Length) was developed for these synthesizers, as well as a compiler for the language, two music text editors, a filing system for music binaries, programs to play the music binaries in real time, and print musical scores, and many debugging and compositional aids. A number of interactive compositional programs have also been written. Gooch's peripherals were heavily used for music education courseware as created, for example, by the University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project. From 1970 to 1994, the University of Illinois (U of I) School of Music explored the use of the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (CERL) PLATO computer system to deliver online instruction in music. Led by G. David Peters, music faculty and students worked with PLATO‚Äôs technical capabilities to produce music-related instructional materials and experimented with their use in the music curriculum. Peters began his work on PLATO III. By 1972, the PLATO IV system made it technically possible to introduce multimedia pedagogies that were not available in the marketplace until years later. Between 1974 and 1988, 25 U of I music faculty participated in software curriculum development and more than 40 graduate students wrote software and assisted the faculty in its use. In 1988, the project broadened its focus beyond PLATO to accommodate the increasing availability and use of microcomputers. The broader scope resulted in renaming the project to The Illinois Technology-based Music Project. Work in the School of Music continued on other platforms after the CERL PLATO system shutdown in 1994. Over the 24-year life of the music project, its many participants moved into educational institutions and into the private sector. Their influence can be traced to numerous multimedia pedagogies, products, and services in use today, especially by musicians and music educators. = Significant early efforts =  Pitch recognition/performance judging  In 1969, G. David Peters began researching the feasibility of using PLATO to teach trumpet students to play with increased pitch and rhythmic precision. He created an interface for the PLATO III terminal. The hardware consisted of (1) filters that could determine the true pitch of a tone, and (2) a counting device to measure tone duration. The device accepted and judged rapid notes, two notes trilled, and lip slurs. Peters demonstrated that judging instrumental performance for pitch and rhythmic accuracy was feasible in computer-assisted instruction. = Rhythm notation and perception = By 1970, a random access audio device was available for use with PLATO III. In 1972, Robert W. Placek conducted a study that used computer-assisted instruction for rhythm perception. Placek used the random access audio device attached to a PLATO III terminal for which he developed music notation fonts and graphics. Students majoring in elementary education were asked to (1) recognize elements of rhythm notation, and (2) listen to rhythm patterns and identify their notations. This was the first known application of the PLATO random-access audio device to computer-based music instruction. Study participants were interviewed about the experience and found it both valuable and enjoyable. Of particular value was PLATO‚Äôs immediate feedback. Though participants noted shortcomings in the quality of the audio, they generally indicated that they were able to learn the basic skills of rhythm notation recognition. These PLATO IV terminal included many new devices and yielded two notable music projects:  Visual diagnostic skills for instrumental music educators  By the mid-1970s, James O. Froseth (University of Michigan) had published training materials that taught instrumental music teachers to visually identify typical problems demonstrated by beginning band students. For each instrument, Froseth developed an ordered checklist of what to look for (i.e., posture, embouchure, hand placement, instrument position, etc.) and a set of 35mm slides of young players demonstrating those problems. In timed class exercises, trainees briefly viewed slides and recorded their diagnoses on the checklists which were reviewed and evaluated later in the training session. In 1978, William H. Sanders adapted Froseth‚Äôs program for delivery using the PLATO IV system. Sanders transferred the slides to microfiche for rear-projection through the PLATO IV terminal‚Äôs plasma display. In timed drills, trainees viewed the slides, then filled in the checklists by touching them on the display. The program gave immediate feedback and kept aggregate records. Trainees could vary the timing of the exercises and repeat them whenever they wished. Sanders and Froseth subsequently conducted a study to compare traditional classroom delivery of the program to delivery using PLATO. The results showed no significant difference between the delivery methods for a) student post-test performance and b) their attitudes toward the training materials. However, students using the computer appreciated the flexibility to set their own practice hours, completed significantly more practice exercises, and did so in significantly less time.  Musical instrument identification  In 1967, Allvin and Kuhn used a four-channel tape recorder interfaced to a computer to present pre-recorded models to judge sight-singing performances. In 1969, Ned C. Deihl and Rudolph E. Radocy conducted a computer-assisted instruction study in music that included discriminating aural concepts related to phrasing, articulation, and rhythm on the clarinet. They used a four-track tape recorder interfaced to a computer to provide pre-recorded audio passages. Messages were recorded on three tracks and inaudible signals on the fourth track with two hours of play/record time available. This research further demonstrated that computer-controlled audio with four-track tape was possible. In 1979, Williams used a digitally controlled cassette tape recorder that had been interfaced to a minicomputer (Williams, M.A. \\"A comparison of three approaches to the teaching of auditory-visual discrimination, sight singing and music dictation to college music students: A traditional approach, a Kodaly approach, and a Kodaly approach augmented by computer-assisted instruction,\\" University of Illinois, unpublished). This device worked, yet was slow with variable access times. In 1981, Nan T. Watanabe researched the feasibility of computer- assisted music instruction using computer-controlled pre-recorded audio. She surveyed audio hardware that could interface with a computer system. Random- access audio devices interfaced to PLATO IV terminals were also available. There were issues with sound quality due to dropouts in the audio. Regardless, Watanabe deemed consistent fast access to audio clips critical to the study design and selected this device for the study. Watanabe‚Äôs computer-based drill-and-practice program taught elementary music education students to identify musical instruments by sound. Students listened to randomly selected instrument sounds, identified the instrument they heard, and received immediate feedback. Watanabe found no significant difference in learning between the group who learned through computer-assisted drill programs and the group receiving traditional instruction in instrument identification. The study did, however, demonstrate that use of random-access audio in computer- assisted instruction in music was feasible.  The Illinois Technology-based music project  By 1988, with the spread of micro-computers and their peripherals, the University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project was renamed The Illinois Technology-based Music Project. Researchers subsequently explored the use of emerging, commercially available technologies for music instruction until 1994.  Influences and impacts  Educators and students used the PLATO System for music instruction at other educational institutions including Indiana University, Florida State University, and the University of Delaware. Many alumni of the University of Illinois School of Music PLATO Project gained early hands-on experience in computing and media technologies and moved into influential positions in both education and the private sector. The goal of this system was to provide tools for music educators to use in the development of instructional materials, which might possibly include music dictation drills, automatically graded keyboard performances, envelope and timbre ear-training, interactive examples or labs in musical acoustics, and composition and theory exercises with immediate feedback. One ear-training application, Ottaviano, became a required part of certain undergraduate music theory courses at Florida State University in the early 1980s. Another peripheral was the Votrax speech synthesizer, and a \\"say\\" instruction (with \\"saylang\\" instruction to choose the language) was added to the Tutor programming language to support text-to-speech synthesis using the Votrax.  Other Efforts  One of CDC's greatest commercial successes with PLATO was an online testing system developed for National Association of Securities Dealers (now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority), a private-sector regulator of the US securities markets. During the 1970s Michael Stein, E. Clarke Porter and PLATO veteran Jim Ghesquiere, in cooperation with NASD executive Frank McAuliffe, developed the first \\"on- demand\\" proctored commercial testing service. The testing business grew slowly and was ultimately spun off from CDC as Drake Training and Technologies in 1990. Applying many of the PLATO concepts used in the late 1970s, E. Clarke Porter led the Drake Training and Technologies testing business (today Thomson Prometric) in partnership with Novell, Inc. away from the mainframe model to a LAN-based client server architecture and changed the business model to deploy proctored testing at thousands of independent training organizations on a global scale. With the advent of a pervasive global network of testing centers and IT certification programs sponsored by, among others, Novell and Microsoft, the online testing business exploded. Pearson VUE was founded by PLATO/Prometric veterans E. Clarke Porter, Steve Nordberg and Kirk Lundeen in 1994 to further expand the global testing infrastructure. VUE improved on the business model by being one of the first commercial companies to rely on the Internet as a critical business service and by developing self-service test registration. The computer-based testing industry has continued to grow, adding professional licensure and educational testing as important business segments. A number of smaller testing-related companies also evolved from the PLATO system. One of the few survivors of that group is The Examiner Corporation. Dr. Stanley Trollip (formerly of the University of Illinois Aviation Research Lab) and Gary Brown (formerly of Control Data) developed the prototype of The Examiner System in 1984. In the early 1970s, James Schuyler developed a system at Northwestern University called HYPERTUTOR as part of Northwestern's MULTI-TUTOR computer assisted instruction system. This ran on several CDC mainframes at various sites.. Between 1973 and 1980, a group under the direction of Thomas T. Chen at the Medical Computing Laboratory of the School of Basic Medical Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign ported PLATO's TUTOR programming language to the MODCOMP IV minicomputer.. Douglas W. Jones, A.B. Baskin, Tom Szolyga, Vincent Wu and Lou Bloomfield did most of the implementation. This was the first port of TUTOR to a minicomputer and was largely operational by 1976.. In 1980, Chen founded Global Information Systems Technology of Champaign, Illinois, to market this as the Simpler system. GIST eventually merged with the Government Group of Adayana Inc. Vincent Wu went on to develop the Atari PLATO cartridge. CDC eventually sold the \\"PLATO\\" trademark and some courseware marketing segment rights to the newly formed The Roach Organization (TRO) in 1989. In 2000 TRO changed their name to PLATO Learning and continue to sell and service PLATO courseware running on PCs. In late 2012, PLATO Learning brought its online learning solutions to market under the name Edmentum.. CDC continued development of the basic system under the name CYBIS (CYber-Based Instructional System) after selling the trademarks to Roach, in order to service their commercial and government customers. CDC later sold off their CYBIS business to University Online, which was a descendant of IMSATT. University Online was later renamed to VCampus. The University of Illinois also continued development of PLATO, eventually setting up a commercial on- line service called NovaNET in partnership with University Communications, Inc. CERL was closed in 1994, with the maintenance of the PLATO code passing to UCI. UCI was later renamed NovaNET Learning, which was bought by National Computer Systems (NCS). Shortly after that, NCS was bought by Pearson, and after several name changes now operates as Pearson Digital Learning.  Other versions  = In South Africa = During the period when CDC was marketing PLATO, the system began to be used internationally. South Africa was one of the biggest users of PLATO in the early 1980s. Eskom, the South African electrical power company, had a large CDC mainframe at Megawatt Park in the northwest suburbs of Johannesburg. Mainly this computer was used for management and data processing tasks related to power generation and distribution, but it also ran the PLATO software. The largest PLATO installation in South Africa during the early 1980s was at the University of the Western Cape, which served the \\"native\\" population, and at one time had hundreds of PLATO IV terminals all connected by leased data lines back to Johannesburg. There were several other installations at educational institutions in South Africa, among them Madadeni College in the Madadeni township just outside Newcastle. This was perhaps the most unusual PLATO installation anywhere. Madadeni had about 1,000 students, all of them who were original inhabitants i.e. native population and 99.5% of Zulu ancestry. The college was one of 10 teacher preparation institutions in kwaZulu, most of them much smaller. In many ways Madadeni was very primitive. None of the classrooms had electricity and there was only one telephone for the whole college, which one had to crank for several minutes before an operator might come on the line. So an air-conditioned, carpeted room with 16 computer terminals was a stark contrast to the rest of the college. At times the only way a person could communicate with the outside world was through PLATO term- talk. For many of the Madadeni students, most of whom came from very rural areas, the PLATO terminal was the first time they encountered any kind of electronic technology. Many of the first-year students had never seen a flush toilet before. There initially was skepticism that these technologically illiterate students could effectively use PLATO, but those concerns were not borne out. Within an hour or less most students were using the system proficiently, mostly to learn math and science skills, although a lesson that taught keyboarding skills was one of the most popular. A few students even used on-line resources to learn TUTOR, the PLATO programming language, and a few wrote lessons on the system in the Zulu language. PLATO was also used fairly extensively in South Africa for industrial training. Eskom successfully used PLM (PLATO learning management) and simulations to train power plant operators, South African Airways (SAA) used PLATO simulations for cabin attendant training, and there were a number of other large companies as well that were exploring the use of PLATO. The South African subsidiary of CDC invested heavily in the development of an entire secondary school curriculum (SASSC) on PLATO, but unfortunately as the curriculum was nearing the final stages of completion, CDC began to falter in South Africa‚Äîpartly because of financial problems back home, partly because of growing opposition in the United States to doing business in South Africa, and partly due to the rapidly evolving microcomputer, a paradigm shift that CDC failed to recognize. = Cyber1 = In August 2004, a version of PLATO. corresponding to the final release from CDC was resurrected online. This version of PLATO runs on a free and open-source software emulation of the original CDC hardware called Desktop Cyber. Within six months, by word of mouth alone, more than 500 former users had signed up to use the system. Many of the students who used PLATO in the 1970s and 1980s felt a special social bond with the community of users who came together using the powerful communications tools (talk programs, records systems and notesfiles) on PLATO. The PLATO software used on Cyber1 is the final release (99A) of CYBIS, by permission of VCampus. The underlying operating system is NOS 2.8.7, the final release of the NOS operating system, by permission of Syntegra (now British Telecom [BT]), which had acquired the remainder of CDC's mainframe business. Cyber1 runs this software on the Desktop Cyber emulator. Desktop Cyber accurately emulates in software a range of CDC Cyber mainframe models and many peripherals. Cyber1 offers free access to the system, which contains over 16,000 of the original lessons, in an attempt to preserve the original PLATO communities that grew up at CERL and on CDC systems in the 1980s. The load average of this resurrected system is about 10‚Äì15 users, sending personal and notesfile notes, and playing inter-terminal games such as Avatar and Empire (a Star Trek-like game), which had both accumulated more than 1.0 million contact hours on the original PLATO system at UIUC.

He served in a number of political positions in Virginia, including election as the 28th Governor of Virginia. Gilmer's final political office was as the 15th Secretary of the Navy, but he died in an accident ten days after assuming that position. Personal life Gilmer was born to George and Eliza Gilmer at their farm, \\"Gilmerton\\", in Albemarle County, Virginia. He was taught by private tutors in Charlottesville and Staunton, and studied law in Liberty (now Bedford), Virginia.Jamerson, p. 61Lewis, p. 686 Gilmer practiced law in Charlottesville. He was, briefly, editor of the Virginia Advocate, a Charlottesville newspaper. On May 23, 1826, Gilmer married Anne Elizabeth Baker of Shepherdstown, now in West Virginia. Her late father, John Baker, had been a member of the United States House of Representatives. They had a son, George Hudson Gilmer, a Presbyterian minister. In 1829, Gilmer purchased Israel Jefferson, a former slave of Thomas Jefferson, who is best known for claiming that Sally Hemings was Thomas Jefferson's concubine. Gilmer later agreed to let Israel pay his own purchase price for his freedom after Gilmer's election to congress, as Israel desired to stay with his wife, a free woman. Political career Sketch of Thomas W. Gilmer Gilmer first served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1829‚Äì36, representing Albemarle County. He returned in 1839‚Äì40 and was named Speaker. On February 14, 1840, Gilmer was elected the 28th Governor of Virginia. While in office, he had a disagreement with the Virginia General Assembly over the extradition of slave stealers, which played a part in his running for Congress the following winter. In March 1841, he entered the 27th Congress, and although he had been elected as a Whig, voted to sustain Democratic 10th President John Tyler's vetoes (partially because of party differences resulting from the unique situation having a \\"split ticket\\" of the Election of 1840 in which the President and Vice Presidents were from different political parties). Tyler had just succeeded to the office after the death of elderly 9th President William Henry Harrison, (who was a member of the opposing Whig Party) only one month after his inauguration on March 4, 1841, where he fell sick from reading one of the longest addresses on record without a coat and hat in the bitter cold. Tyler had very little support in the Party and eventually served just the rest of the term. Gilmer however was re-elected to the 28th Congress as a Democrat in 1842 by a close vote. His competitor, William L. Goggin, contested the result without success. As one of President John Tyler's close Virginia allies in Washington, Gilmer was involved in the effort by the Tyler Administration to make the annexation of Texas the basis for his failed bid for reelection in 1844. On February 15, 1844, he was appointed by Tyler to be the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, and resigned his seat in the Congress the next day to enter on the duties of the office; but, 10 days later, he was killed by the bursting of a bow gun on board while on a tour of the Potomac River below Washington. His death meant the loss of a valuable ally for Tyler and some historians suggest that it may have delayed the Texas Annexation effort. =Electoral history= 1842: Gilmer was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 50.21% of the vote, defeating William Leftwich Goggin. Legacy Gilmer is buried at Mount Air Cemetery in Gilbert, Virginia. A year after his death, Gilmer County, Virginia was named in his honor; it is now part of West Virginia. The city of Gilmer, Texas, is also named for him. (Gilmer is the county seat of surrounding Upshur County, Texas, named after Abel Parker Upshur, (1790‚Äì1844), another victim of the explosion in February 1844 on board the naval ship on the Potomac River, below Washington Two ships of the United States Navy over the years have been named in his honor.

She kept her work consistently in a recognizable style, and received broad recognition in the 1960s. Bontecou made abstract sculptures in the 1960s and 1970s and created vacuum-formed plastic fish, plants, and flower forms in the 1970s. Rich, organic shapes and powerful energy appear in her drawings, prints, and sculptures. Her work has been shown and collected in many major museums in the United States and in Europe. Early life and education Bontecou attended Bradford Junior College (now Bradford College) in Haverhill, Massachusetts for her general education and then attended the Art Students League of New York from 1952 to 1955, where she studied with the sculptor William Zorach.\\"Lee Bontecou\\" , The Whitney Museum of American Art, Retrieved 22 December 2014. She also spent the summer of 1954 at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine, where she learned to weld. She received a Fulbright scholarship from the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission to study in Rome in 1957-1958. In 1971, she began teaching at Brooklyn College. Bontecou's work is deeply affected by WWII. Both her parents joined the war effort. Her mother wired transmitters for submarine navigation and her father sold gliders for the military. Growing up, she would spend summers with her grandmother in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, where she developed a love of the natural world. She had an older brother, Hank. Career Bontecou is best known for the sculptures she created in 1959 and the 1960s, which challenged artistic conventions of both materials and presentation by hanging on the wall. They consist of welded steel frames covered with recycled canvas and industrial materials (such as conveyor belts or mail sacks) and other found objects.

She was brought back to public attention by a 2003 retrospective co-organized by the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, that traveled to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 2004. The retrospective included both work from her public, art-world career and an extensive display of work done after retreating from the public view. Bontecou's work was also included in the Carnegie International 2004-5 exhibit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2010, the Museum of Modern Art presented a retrospective of Bontecou's work entitled All Freedom in Every Sense. In 2014, her drawings were exhibited in Lee Bontecou: Drawn Worlds, organized by The Menil Collection, which traveled to the Princeton University Art Museum. Her work was also included in Revolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women, 1947-2016 at Hauser Wirth & Schimmel in 2016. In 2017, a major exhibition of Bontecou's drawings and sculpture, including a site-specific installation entitled Sandbox, a collaboration between Bontecou and Joan Banach, was organized by the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag. The exhibition was curated by Joan Banach and Laura Stamps, and accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue published by Hannibal (Dutch) and Koenig Books, London (English). The catalogue contains new essays on Lee Bontecou by Laura Stamps, Curator of Modern Art at The Gemeentemuseum, Joan Banach, and Jeremy Melius, with an introduction by Gemeentemuseum Director, Benno Tempel. Perspective In the 1960s, Bontecou's work was hailed for its unique position in between painting and sculpture. Sculptor Donald Judd wrote that her work \\"asserts its own existence, form and power. It becomes an object in its own right.\\" The openness, autonomy and engineering processes central to her work, were embraced by the Feminist Art Movement in the 1970s and her use of cavities and holes has been read as female genitalia, and the related, central core imagery. It is an association the artist has denied. Her work has been characterized by references to the synergy between nature and fiction, resulting naturalistically rendered creatures, with grotesquely morphed features.Butler, C., et al. Eds. 2010. Modern Women: Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Art. MoMA. Techniques and materials Lee Bontecou works with many materials, such as metal, paper, plastic and fibreglass. She also works with unconventional materials and discovers new techniques. In her drawings, she developed a process in the late 1950s of using an oxyacetylene torch to produce a carbon spray from the flame, resulting in an \\"airbrushed\\" look and deep saturated blacks that she took to her sculptural work.

It has the distinction of being \\"the first jet-lift aircraft to fly anywhere in the world\\". The design of the TMR is unique. It was powered by a pair of Nene turbojet engines, which were mounted back-to-back horizontally within a steel framework; in turn, this framework was raised upon four legs fitted with castors for wheels. The TMR lacked any lifting surfaces, such as wings; instead, lift was generated purely by the thrust generated by the Nene engines being directed downwards against the ground. Due to its unconventional appearance, it was understandably nicknamed the Flying Bedstead.Illingworth 1961, p. 2. The TMR had been envisioned specifically for conducting research, specifically to explore the potential applications of then-newly developed jet propulsion towards carrying out vertical flights. First flying in August 1954, extensive studies were conducted during a series of test flights into how stabilisation could be performed during the aircraft's hover. It contributed to a greater understanding of the level of power and appropriate manners of stabilisation involved in a VTOL aircraft, as well as proving the feasibility of the concept in general.Illingworth 1961, pp. 2-3.  Development  The man largely responsible for the development of the TMR was Dr Alan Arnold Griffith, who had worked on gas turbine design at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), in the 1920s and was a pioneer of jet lift technology. In 1939, Griffith had been employed by Rolls-Royce. During the 1940s, he conceived of using jet propulsion as a method of directly providing vertical lift to produce an aircraft that could take off vertically. The construction of a such an aircraft for research purposes was suggested by Griffith. Being suitably impressed by Griffith's concept, while also being keen to explore and harness the capabilities of its newly-developed range of jet engines, Rolls- Royce commenced construction of the aircraft at the company's facility at Hucknall Aerodrome, Nottinghamshire, England. The crucial auto-stabiliser for the aircraft was designed and produced by the Instrument and Air Photography Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). The aircraft was designated as the Thrust Measuring Rigs (TMR), a pair were constructed for the test program.Fricker 1962, p. 25. On 19 August 1953, the first TMR conducted its maiden flight at Hucknall Aerodrome. In order to perform these flights, a purpose-built gantry-like arrangement had been devised and assembled at Hucknall which, while not restricting the aircraft's movement within a defined space, prevented it from exceeding that boundary; it also prevented excessive descent rates, allowing for a maximum descent rate of 10 ft per second, from occurring in order to avoid sustaining damage and allowed struggling pilots to readily close the throttles without a resulting accident.Illingworth 1961, pp. 2, 17. During the first year of flights, the aircraft remained tethered within the gantry system for flight testing. On 3 August 1954, the TMR conducted its first free flight, piloted by Ronald Thomas Shepherd, Rolls-Royce's chief test pilot. In late 1954, the TMR was transferred to the RAE's research facilities, firstly being assigned to RAE Farnborough. In June 1956, it was relocated to RAE Bedford, Bedfordshire, for the purposes of conducting further flight tests. While the practicalities surrounding controllability had been addressed during its time at Hucknall, the RAE were more interested in using the TMR to determine if artificial stabilisation would be necessary for such aircraft, both during the hover and the low-speed stages of flight, and to investigate desirable characteristics towards achieving stable vertical flight.Illingworth 1961, p. 3. Information from typical flights was primarily acquired through the reported experiences of the pilots.Illingworth 1961, p. 6. During stability trials, more quantifiable data was gained by instructing multiple pilots to follow the same sequence of manoeuvres, many of which were intended to be representative of VTOL aircraft transitioning into hovering flight; multiple observers were also employed as well. Test flights had several safety restrictions placed upon them: the TMR was not typically flown if the wind speed was 10 knots or greater, it would only fly under weather conditions in which the aircraft could be controlled in the event of a fault.Illingworth 1961, pp. 6-7. Pilots were able to perform take-offs and controlled landings, but found both feats to be more difficult if wind was present, particularly if the TMR was required to tilt in order to counteract the wind's effects.Illingworth 1961, p. 8. Reportedly, pilots found that the main initial difficulty in flying the TMR was the regulation of the aircraft's height; this was partially due to the slow response of the engine to throttle movements being commanded by the pilot.Illingworth 1961, p. 7. The delay interval between the throttle and the engine response was often around the one-to-two second mark; pilots would typically adapt to this peculiarity of the aircraft and become adept at mastering height control. Two attempts were made to improve the height control, the addition of a simplistic trimmer on the throttle to restrict its possible speed of movement, and the installation of 'throttle-anticipators' that failed to operate as intended. The TMR effectively demonstrated that delay in the height control response would be a major difficulty of VTOL aircraft, and the engines of later VTOL aircraft did typically feature faster response times.Fricker 1962, pp. 60-61. The aircraft survived a failure of its thrust-vectored control system on 16 September 1957 whilst being piloted by Wing Commander Stan Hubbard of the RAE. On 29 November 1957, the second TMR, Serial XK426, was destroyed during a test flight, resulting in the death of Wing Commander H. G. F. Larsen, who had been piloting the aircraft for the first time. The research from the TMR's test programme were of considerable value to future VTOL aircraft, as least in some areas: an official report published by the Ministry of Aviation summarised that \\"the main conclusion to be drawn from this experience is that any practical jet-lift aircraft must have some artificial stabilisation while hovering if it is to operate in other than very favourable weather conditions...the main difficulty in learning to fly the aircraft was the height control; any reduction in the time constant of the engine response would make the problem of learning to fly a jet-lift aircraft easier\\".Illingworth 1961, pp. 13. Following the relatively successful trials of the TMR, Rolls-Royce decided to proceed with the development of the Rolls- Royce RB108 direct-lift turbojet; five of these engines were used to power the first true British VTOL aircraft, the Short SC.1.Fricker 1962, p. 60.  Design  The Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig (TMR) was a VTOL aircraft developed to explore the practicality, characteristics, and requirements of such an aircraft. It was widely known by its nickname of the Flying Bedstead due to its radically unconventional appearance for an aircraft, basically consisting of a rectangular tubular framework that was built around the engines, a platform being placed on top of which to accommodate a single pilot. It did not have any aerodynamic shape, lacking either wings or a tail; it instead generated all of its lift by directing the thrust of its engines directly downwards.Illingworth 1961, pp. 3, 13. Due its small size, the TMR had a maximum flight endurance of only six minutes. It was powered by a pair of Nene turbojet engines, which were installed in a back-to-back configuration. The output of the jets was directed towards the centre of gravity of the rig; one jetpipe discharging downwards through a central nozzle while the other jet discharged downwards through two smaller nozzles on either side; this was so that, in the event of a single engine failing during flight, there would not be any sharp adverse movement as a result. Considerable precautions were taken to safely sustain such an engine failure; the four-leg undercarrage was designed to support a vertical velocity of 34 ft per second, and to withstand a single-engine landing from any height below 50 feet. The TMR possessed only marginal excess power, which complicated the act of flying the aircraft; this was further compounded by the slow response time of the engines to throttle changes. Accordingly, there was a considerable degree of anticipation in the use of engine power required to prevent overshooting of desired altitude, and to ensure a gentle touchdown when landing.Illingworth 1961, pp. 7-8. A total of four outrigger arms extended out from the rig, one on either side and one each at the front and rear, through which compressed air was released for control in roll, pitch and yaw when in flight.Illingworth 1961, pp. 3-4. While the controls for yaw and height were mechanically-based, the pitch and roll controls were electrically signalled, without any provision for reverting to mechanical operation. Initially, key components for the electrical control system components were duplicated; however, in order to make the detection of faults infallible, a safer partial-triplex arrangement was adopted for the RAE's free flight testing phase.Illingworth 1961, p. 4. As the TMR possessed no inherent stability, it incorporated an experimental automatic stabiliser system.Illingworth 1961, p. 12. During its numerous test flights, varying degrees of intervention by the stabiliser were performed, including a few in which no stabilisation was active at all.Illingworth 1961, pp. 9-10.

With the reform of the Italian Intelligence Services approved on 1 August 2007, SISMI was replaced by Agenzia Informazioni e Sicurezza Esterna (AISE).Legislative Act n.124 of 08/03/2007, reported on the Official Gazette of the Italian Republic, General Series, n.187 of 08/13/2007. . History Since the end of World War II, Italian intelligence agencies have been reorganized many times (SIM 1900-49, SIFAR 1949-65, SID 1965-77) and last SISDE (civil) and SISMI (military) from 1977 to 2007, in an attempt to increase their effectiveness and bring them more fully under civilian control. The agency was established as part of a broader reform of the Italian intelligence community, which represented the latest in a long string of government attempts to effectively manage Italy's intelligence agencies. * In 1977, with Legislative Act n.801, the SISMI was created after a former chief of the SID, Vito Miceli, was arrested in 1974 for \\"conspiring against the State\\" (See Golpe Borghese of the 1970). Thus the intelligence agencies were reorganized in a democratic attempt. This re-organization mainly consisted of: ** The split of SID, the intelligence agency at that time, into two separate agencies with different roles: SISDE (the domestic one) and SISMI (the military one). ** The creation of CESIS, with a coordination role between the two intelligence agencies and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. ** The creation of the Parliamentary Committee, COPACO, to oversee the activities of the two agencies. * Since 1 August 2007, with Legislative Act n.124 of 08/03/2007, following the reform of the Italian intelligence agencies, SISDE, SISMI and CESIS were replaced respectively by AISI, AISE and DIS, and the COPACO was granted additional oversight and control powers. The first director of the service was Giuseppe Santovito (1978‚Äì1981), succeeded by General Nino Lugaresi was SISMI's director from 1981 to 1984; he testified on Gladio. General Nicol√≤ Pollari was SISMI's second-last director; he resigned on 20 November 2006 after being indicted in the Imam Rapito affair, so Prime Minister Romano Prodi replaced him with Admiral Bruno Branciforte. Admiral Bruno Branciforte was SISMI's last director, in charge until 3 August 2007. With the reform of the Italian Intelligence Services approved on 1 August 2007 the military intelligence was eliminated, and the italian intelligence was divided into internal and foreign. Mission SISMI was responsible for intelligence and security activities involving the military defence of Italy and for the integrity of the Italian State. SISMI reported to the Italian Ministry of Defense and operated both inside and outside of Italy's borders. It was feasible that domestic Intelligence and Security, which normally fell under SISDE's jurisdiction (since it reported to the Ministry of the Interior), involved SISMI too, unless the security threat came from organized crime. Its duties included: * clearing activities with the Prime Minister; * nominating the Director of the Service and his assistants under CIIS supervision.  The directors  *General Giuseppe Santovito (First director, 13 January 1978 - August 1981) *General Nino Lugaresi (August 1981 - 4 May 1984) *Admiral Fulvio Martini (5 May 1984 - 26 February 1991) *General Sergio Luccarini (27 February 1991 - 19 August 1991) *General Luigi Ramponi (19 August 1991 - 9 August 1992) *General Cesare Pucci (10 August 1992 - 12 July 1994) *General Sergio Siracusa (12 July 1994 - 3 November 1996) *Admiral Gianfranco Battelli (4 November 1996 - 30 September 2001) *General Nicol√≤ Pollari (1 October 2001 - 20 November 2006) *Admiral Bruno Branciforte (21 November 2006 - 3 August 2007)  Motto and logo  SISMI's motto, as seen on its logo, was \\"\\" (Latin for \\"Understanding hidden things\\"). The verb \\"\\", which literally means \\"I comprehend\\", was chosen because ¬´it evokes the noble root of intelligence, a discipline aimed at unravelling mysteries and holds in itself a constant tension directed to its final goal: knowledge¬ª.The Italian Intelligence and Security Services Official website - SISMI's Coat of Arms Description . Its coat of arms was granted by a decree of the President of the Republic dated 28 January 2004. Recent controversies = Nicola Calipari and Giuliana Sgrena = In 2004, Nicola Calipari, a high-ranking SISMI hostage negotiator, was killed at a U.S. Army checkpoint in Baghdad by Mario Lozano, purportedly after a communication breakdown between the Italian intelligence community and the occupying forces. = Yellowcake forgery = In 2005, SISMI was implicated in the yellowcake forgery scandal. The forged documents purporting to detail an Iraqi purchase of yellowcake uranium from Niger were given to a \\"cutout\\" named Rocco Martino by a Colonel in SISMI, Antonio Nucera. The head of SISMI, after claiming his agency received the documents from external sources, met with then-Deputy National Security Advisor, Stephen Hadley, on 9 September 2002. Reportedly, the SISMI director vouched for the documents' authenticity at the meeting; as a result, the White House attempted to insert a reference to uranium from Africa in President Bush's upcoming address to the United Nations, scheduled for 12 September 2002. The CIA removed the reference 24 hours before the address was given. In bypassing the CIA, Pollari ignored the established protocol for contacts between Italian and American intelligence agencies. President Bush later used the same discredited information when delivering his January 2003 State of the Union address. = Imam Rapito = In July 2006, the Italian judiciary power issued arrest warrants for several SISMI officials involved in the joint CIA-SISMI operation resulting in the unlawful extraordinary rendition of Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, which SISMI Director Pollari had formally denied in testimony before a committee of the national legislature. Among these were: * former Deputy Director Marco Mancini * General Gustavo Pignero, agency chief for Northern Italy * Mancini's aide Giuseppe Ciorra * Pio Pompa, aide to SISMI Director Nicol√≤ Pollari (he was indicted for \\"abusive interception\\" against the vice- president of La Repubblica, Giuseppe D'AvanzoPaolo Biondani and Guido Olimpio. 11 July 2006 Corriere della Sera, \\"Un centro segreto Cia-Sismi\\" available here ) * former Trieste Station Chief Lorenzo Pillinini * former Padua Station Chief Marco Iodice * Milan Station Chief Maurizio Regondi Nicol√≤ Pollari himself would later be indicted on 5 December 2006, and sentenced to 10 years in jail on February 12, 2013. Marco Mancini was sentenced to 9 years in jail. They appealed against this ruling. On 16 February 2007, an Italian judge ordered twenty-six Americans and five Italians (including Pollari) to stand trial over the case on the 8th of June, 2007. As part of the judiciary investigation, a SISMI-run black operation targeting center-left politician Romano Prodi and a vast domestic surveillance program was uncovered. Pompa prevailed upon the newspaper Libero to print allegations that Prodi, when serving as European Commissioner, had authorized the CIA prison flights via Italy. Targeted in the surveillance program were La Repubblica reporters Giuseppe D'Avanzo and Carlo Bonini, who broke the yellowcake forgery story. = Spying on magistrates = Italian magistrates searching the SISMI's headquarters in August 2007 found documents proving that the intelligence agency had spied over various European magistrates between 2001 and 2006, whom it considered carrying a \\"destabilization\\" potential. These included the Medel, a European association of magistrates, as well as three French judges, including Anne Crenier, former president of the Syndicat de la magistrature French union, who is married to Italian magistrate Mario Vaudano who works at the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).Ecco i dossier del Sismi sui generali \\"di sinistra\\", La Repubblica, 6 July 2007 Trois juges fran√ßais espionn√©s par les services secrets italiens, Rue 89, 12 July 2007 See also * Italian intelligence agencies * SIOS  References  External links *The Italian Intelligence and Security Services Official Website - SISMI *The Italian Intelligence and Security Services Official Website - Home Page *The Italian Intelligence and Security Services Official Website - A Brief History Military of Italy Italian intelligence agencies Military intelligence agencies Military units and formations established in 1977 Military units and formations disestablished in 2007 ","title":"SISMI"},{"id":"1000536","text":"Marvin M. Mitchelson (May 7, 1928 in Detroit, Michigan - September 18, 2004 in Beverly Hills, California) was an American celebrity lawyer who pioneered the concept of palimony, calling it \\"marriage with no rings attached.\\" Early life Mitchelson was the youngest child of three and only son of poor Russian immigrants. The family relocated from Detroit to Los Angeles when Marvin was in high school. After graduation he served a term in the United States Navy. After leaving the service, he entered UCLA, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree. He obtained a Juris Doctor degree from Southwestern University School of Law, and was admitted to the State Bar of California on 4 June 1957. He had passed the bar exam on his second try. He then set up a private legal practice in Los Angeles. Legal career In 1963 Mitchelson won a landmark United States Supreme Court decision, Douglas v. California, protecting indigent defendants' right to legal counsel. He gained national publicity when he was hired by Michelle Triola, a lounge singer who lived with actor Lee Marvin as his personal partner from 1964 until 1970, when Marvin told her to move out because he wanted to marry another woman. Mitchelson helped Triola--who claimed that she was entitled to the same benefits as a divorc√©e, which meant half of Marvin's then-$3.6 million fortune--win her right to bring suit. Although Triola was awarded $104,000 for \\"rehabilitation\\" in 1978, that ruling was overturned in 1981, and Marvin never paid Triola any money. Marvin v. Marvin (Triola assumed Marvin's name during the relationship) set a precedent. Mitchelson's celebrity clients included Pamela Mason (wife of James Mason), who received a $2 million divorce settlement from her ex-husband, Marvin Mitchelson Biography at astro.com Robert De Niro, Mickey Rooney, Sylvester Stallone, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joan Collins, Mel Torm√©, Bianca Jagger, Lesley-Anne Down, Carl Sagan, Mrs. William Shatner, and many ex-wives of errant playboy sheiks. Later years and death During his heyday Mitchelson owned a 38-room Beverly Hills mansion and four Rolls-Royce automobiles. In his Century City office he had a chair owned by Rudolph Valentino and an illuminated ceiling of Botticelli's Venus which matched his belt buckle. He made a brief cameo appearance on The Golden Girls (\\"There Goes the Bride\\"); his role was as a lawyer for Stanley Zbornak, ex-husband of Dorothy Zbornak. In the episode, he produced a prenuptial agreement which Dorothy had to sign. She refused, and their remarriage was canceled. Mitchelson was quoted as saying \\"A divorce lawyer is a chameleon with a law book.\\" He was accused of rape by two women in the early 1990s, but the authorities declined to prosecute.https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/03/us/marvin-mitchelson-wins-suit- involving-accusation-of-rape.html However, on 12 April 1993 he was sentenced to 30 months in prison on four counts of felony tax fraud and failure to properly oversee a trust account. In 1994 he was cited for failing to take the professional responsibility exam, had his probation revoked in 1995, and was disciplined in 1996 for failure to provide accountings or return unearned fees in 14 client matters. A 1993 conviction for not paying taxes on some $2 million in income resulted in suspension from the Bar, bankruptcy and eventually two years in jail from 1996 to 1998. The case was initiated by a former girlfriend of Mitchelson's and was investigated by IRS Special Agent James Lawrence Wilson. He wept on his first day in Lompoc prison, but ultimately found white-collar incarceration stimulating. He organized an opera appreciation society, ran the library and helped other prisoners with their appeals. Mitchelson was married to Italian-born actress Marcella Ferri. Mitchelson died in a rehabilitation center in Beverly Hills, succumbing to cancer.astro.com References *Ladies' Man: The Life and Trials of Marvin Mitchelson by John A.

Early years Myrta Blanca Silva Oliveros was born in the city of Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Her father died when she was six years old and she was raised by her mother, who was her inspiration. Silva and her fans referred to her mother as \\"Mama Yeya.\\" In 1937, Silva made her first public presentation at the Oliver Theater in Arecibo. In either 1938 or 1939, Silva and her mother moved to New York, where she started a career in radio, theater and musical plays. Singing career Silva was working in a cabaret when she was discovered and offered a 10-year contract by RCA. In the late 1930s, she met the Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern√°ndez, who convinced her to join his Cuarteto Victoria. Myrta traveled with the group all over Latin-America. Some time later, she also sang for another composer Pedro Flores in his Sexteto Flores, where she was joined by Daniel Santos and Pedro Ortiz Davila (aka \\"Davilita\\").Music of Puerto Rico =As a composer= In 1941, Silva composed her first song, \\"Cuando Vuelvas\\" (\\"When You Return\\"), recorded by Ruth Fern√°ndez.

From 1949 to 1950, she was the lead singer in the popular Cuban ensemble, La Sonora Matancera, at the same time continuing to compose. She received a good deal of recognition for her groups' performances throughout Latin America. In Argentina, she was named the \\"best-selling artist\\" in that country. In 1950, she was proclaimed by the Cuban government \\"The Most Popular Artist.\\" When she decided to leave the group she was replaced by Celia Cruz, a young school teacher turned singer who went on to become known as the \\"Queen of Salsa.\\" =Madame Chencha= In the 1950s, together with the Cuban composer √ëico Saquito (Antonio Fern√°ndez), Silva wrote a humorous song titled ‚ÄúCamina Como Chencha‚Äù (‚ÄúWalk Like Chencha‚Äù). In 1956, Silva produced and transmitted from New York a television program, Una Hora Contigo (An Hour with You). The show was transmitted by Canal 4 in Puerto Rico and Myrta moved back to the island. In her show she re-created the innovative character of \\"Madame Chencha.\\" \\"Madame Chencha\\" became the first T.V. character dedicated to \\"rumors.\\"In this connection, see Rita Montaner#Rita la Chismosa This character created a lot of controversy between public figures and the television station, and as a consequence, Silva decided to leave the program and return to New York City. =In New York City= In New York City, she composed \\"Puerto Rico del Alma\\" (\\"Puerto Rico of my Soul\\"). Between 1962 and 1964, she composed the following hit songs: \\"Que Sabes Tu\\" (\\"What do you know?\\"), \\"Tengo que Acostumbrarme\\" (\\"I Have To Get Used To It\\"), \\"Juguetes del Destino\\" (\\"Toys of Destiny\\"), and many others. Among her recordings are Voces Romanticas de Puerto Rico (Romantic voices of Puerto Rico), La Bombonera de San Juan (The Bombonera of San Juan) and La Compositora E interprete (The Composer and Interpreter). =Una Hora Contigo (An Hour with You)= During the mid 1960s, Silva hosted a weekly music variety TV show Una Hora Contigo (An Hour with You) on New York City's first Spanish language television station, WNJU-TV Channel 47. The program was hugely popular among the Latino audience, prompting the station to add an additional weekly program hosted by Silva titled Tira y Tapate. In the 1970s, Silva wrote \\"No Te Vayas de Mi Vida\\" (\\"Stay In My Life\\") which was recorded and made popular by Evelyn Souffront. In 1971, Silva returned to Puerto Rico with her television show Una Hora Contigo which this time was transmitted on Canal 11. This show was among the most popular programs in Puerto Rico. Later years Silva was active in many charities and she also participated in many pro-Hispanic activities in the US. During the 1980s, Silva had a program in the government television channel dedicated to music and composers.

Life Deniker was born in 1852 to French parents in Astrakhan, Russian Empire. He first studied at the university and technical institute of St. Petersburg, where he adopted engineering as a profession, and in this capacity traveled extensively in the petroleum districts of the Caucasus, in Central Europe, Italy and Dalmatia. Settling at Paris, France in 1876, he studied at the Sorbonne, where he received a doctorate in natural science in 1886. In 1888 he was appointed chief librarian of the Natural History Museum in Paris. Deniker became one of the chief editors of the Dictionnaire de geographie universelle, and published many papers in the anthropological and zoological journals of France. In 1904 he was invited by the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain to give the Huxley Memorial Lecture. He died in Paris in 1918. Deniker's classification system Sami (Lap) (north), Eastern Finns (Finno-Ugrians) (east) and Turco- Mongols (east and south-east) Deniker's complicated maps of European races, of which he sometimes counted upwards of twenty, were widely referenced in his day, if only to illustrate the extremes of arbitrary racial classification. Deniker had an extensive debate with another racial cartographer, William Z. Ripley, over the nature of race and the number of races. At the time, Ripley maintained that the peoples of Europe were composed of three main racial stocks, while Deniker held there were six primary European races (besides four secondary or subsidiary races). The six primary races are: *Nordic, in the Germanic core territory in Scandinavia, Northern Germany and Frisia, the British Isles and the Baltic. *Littoral or Atlanto-Mediterranean, in the Pyrenees and parts of Spain, western and southern France and north-western Italy * Oriental; also called Eastern, in the Slavic core territory (Belarus, Ukraine and eastern Poland) * Adriatic or Dinaric, around the Adriatic Sea, with widespread remnants in parts of France, Austria, Ukraine and Ciscaucasia. * Ibero-Insular in the Iberian Peninsula, western France, southern Italy and the Mediterranean islands. * Occidental (also called Cevenole); corresponding to Czekanowski's Lapponoid race, was supposedly the race of the paleolithic inhabitants of Europe, with scattered remnants throughout the continent The four subtypes are: *Sub-Nordic, on the fringes of Germanic settlement in southern Britain, Germany and the Baltic *North-Occidental, in the contact zone of Celtic and Germanic, in the British Isles and northern France *Vistulian, named for the Vistula, in the Germanic-Slavic contact zone in Poland *Sub-Adriatic; corresponding to Ripley's Alpine race, was primarily met in the Alps and the historical Continental Celtic core territory According to Jan Czekanowski, both Deniker and Ripley omitted the existence of Armenoid race, which Czekanowski claims to be one of the four main races of Europe, met especially among the Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans. Deniker's most lasting contribution to the field of racial theory was the designation of one of his races as la race nordique. While this group had no special place in Deniker's racial model, this \\"Nordic race\\" would be elevated by the famous eugenicist and anthropologist Madison Grant in his Nordic theory to the engine of civilization. Grant adopted Ripley's three-race model for Europeans, but disliked Ripley's use of the \\"Teuton\\" for one of the races. Grant transliterated la race nordique into \\"Nordic\\", and promoted it to the top of his racial hierarchy in his own popular racial theory of the 1910s and 1920s. Deniker proposed that the concept of race was too confusing, and instead proposed the use of the word \\"ethnic group\\" instead, which was later adopted prominently in the work of Julian Huxley and Alfred C. Haddon. Ripley argued that Deniker's idea of a race should be rather called a \\"type\\", since it was far less biologically rigid than most approaches to the question of race.

Since the cycles themselves were not numbered, other information is needed to identify the specific year. History Indictions originally referred to the periodic reassessment for an agricultural or land tax in late third-century Roman Egypt. These were originally in 5-year cycles beginning in 287 AD, then in a non-cyclic series which reached number 26 by 318 AD. But by 314 AD, the 15-year cycle had appeared. The Chronicon Paschale (c. 630 AD) assigned its first year to 312‚Äì313 AD, whereas a Coptic document of 933 AD assigned its first year to 297‚Äì298 AD, one cycle earlier. Both of these were years of the Alexandrian calendar whose first day was Thoth 1 on August 29 in years preceding common Julian years and August 30 in years preceding leap years, hence each straddled two Julian years. The reason for beginning the year at that time was that the harvest would be in, and so it was an appropriate moment to calculate the taxes that should be paid. The indiction was first used to date documents unrelated to tax collection in the mid-fourth century. By the late fourth century it was being used to date documents throughout the Mediterranean. In the Eastern Roman Empire outside of Egypt, the first day of its year was September 23, the birthday of Augustus. During the last half of the fifth century, probably 462 AD, this shifted to September 1, where it remained throughout the rest of the Byzantine Empire. In 537 AD, Justinian decreed that all dates must include the indiction via Constitutiones 4.21: De fide instrumentorum et amissione eorum et antapochis faciendis et de his quae sine scriptura fieri possunt; Novellae 47, 73., which eventually caused the Byzantine year to begin on . But in the western Mediterranean, its first day was according to Bede, or the following or , called the papal indiction. An indictio Senensis beginning is sometimes mentioned. The 7,980-year Julian Period was formed by multiplying the 15-year indiction cycle, the 28-year solar cycle and the 19-year Metonic cycle. Terminology When the term \\"indiction\\" began to be used, it referred only to the full cycle, and individual years were referred to as being Year 1 of the indiction, Year 2 of the indiction, etc. It gradually became common to apply the term to the years themselves, which thus became the first indiction, the second indiction, and so on. Calculation The indiction for a modern Anno Domini year Y (January 1 to December 31) is :(Y + 2) mod 15 + 1 For example, the indiction for the year 2011 is 4 :(2011 + 2) mod 15 + 1 = 4 So 2008, three years earlier, was a first indiction :(2008 + 2) mod 15 + 1 = 1 This applies even when the Anno Domini year begins during the preceding September, as it did during the early Middle Ages. The indiction for a Byzantine AM year (beginning September 1) is found by dividing that year number by 15 and taking the remainder (modulus). If the remainder is zero, then the indiction is 15. For example, the Byzantine year AM 6961, when Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks, is indiction 1 :6961 mod 15 = 1 References Further reading *Yiannis E.

They sing in both Cornish and English. Various members of Dalla formerly played in Bucca (a Cornish band named for the supernatural sea deities called Bucca), Sowena, Anao Atao and other bands. The music displays influences from these previous sounds. Dalla often appear with many additional instruments, which vary from event to event.  Origins Dalla had its roots in 'The Jack and Jenny Band'. In 1999 they became Sowena, and two years later, the band underwent a second transformation as remaining additional members left and Neil Davey joined to complete the classic Dalla sound. Dalla's Myspace profile cites a wide range of influences. Influence Dalla has greatly influenced Cornish music, encouraging the formation of 'Noze looan' bands, particularly by younger people and They have been involved in numerous Cornish music projects, run by Cumpas such as 'kick up your heels' in which young people from across Cornwall played in a large underground concert at Carnglaze Caverns, or the 'crowders and horners' project, to encourage processional Cornish music and dance.

Several other telescopes are located at the site and are partly maintained by ESO. The observatory is one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere and was the first in Chile to be used by ESO. The La Silla telescopes and instruments are located 150 km northeast of La Serena at the outskirts of the Chilean Atacama Desert, one of the driest and most remote areas of the world. Like other observatories in this geographical area, La Silla is located far from sources of light pollution and, like the Paranal Observatory, home to the Very Large Telescope, it has one of the darkest night skies on the Earth.  History  Following the decision in 1963 to approve Chile as the site for the ESO observatory, scouting parties were sent to various locations to assess their suitability. The site that was decided upon was La Silla in the southern part of the Atacama desert, 600 km north of Santiago de Chile and at an altitude of 2400 metres. Besides being government property, it had the added benefits of being in a dry, flat and easily accessible area, yet isolated and remote from any artificial light and dust sources. Originally named the Cinchado, it was renamed La Silla (\\"the saddle\\" in Spanish) after its saddle- like shape. On October 30, 1964, the contracts were signed and an area of was purchased the following year. During 1965, temporary facilities were erected with living quarters, a workshop and storage area. The dedication ceremony of the road to the summit took place in March 1966, two months after completion of the road. On 25 March 1969, the ESO site at La Silla was finally formally inaugurated by President Eduardo Frei Montalva. With a permanent base of dormitories, workshops, hotels and several functioning telescopes, the observatory was fully operational. The ESO 1.5-metre and ESO 1-metre telescopes had been erected in the late 1960s, and were joined in 1968 by the Gran Prismo Objectif telescope, which had previously been used in South Africa. These three telescopes can be seen in this order from right to left in the background of the image on the left from June 1968. By 1976, the largest telescope planned, the , started operations. It was subsequently to have a 1.4m CAT (Coud√© Auxiliary Telescope) attached. In 1984, the 2.2m telescope began operations, while in March 1989, the 3.5 m New Technology Telescope (NTT) saw first light. The program reached its apex with the installation of the SEST in 1987 (Swedish ESO Submillimetre Telescope), the only large submillimetre telescope in the southern hemisphere, which was a combined project between ESO and the Swedish Natural Science Research Council. Around the end of the century some of the original telescopes were closed: the 1m Schmidt closed in 1998 and the 1.5m in 2002, while new equipment owned by various foreign observatories was introduced. A 1-metre telescope owned by Marseille Observatory opened in 1998, followed by a 1.2-metre telescope from Geneva Observatory in 2000.  Telescopes  ESO operates three major optical and near infrared telescopes at the La Silla site: the New Technology Telescope (NTT), the 3.6-m ESO Telescope, and the 2.2-m Max-Planck-ESO Telescope (MPG/ESO Telescope). In addition La Silla hosts several other national and project telescopes such as the ESO 1-metre Schmidt Telescope, the 1.54-m Danish Telescope, the 1.2-m Leonhard Euler Telescope, the Rapid Eye Mount telescope, TRAPPIST and TAROT. These telescopes are not operated by ESO and hence do not fall under the responsibility of La Silla Science Operations. = ESO 3.6 m Telescope = ESO 3.6 m Telescope. This 3.6 m Cassegrain telescope started operations in 1976 and has been constantly upgraded since, including the installation of a new secondary mirror that has kept the telescope in its place as one of the most efficient and productive engines of astronomical research. The telescope hosts HARPS, the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher, the world's foremost exoplanet hunter. HARPS is a spectrograph with unrivalled precision and is the most successful finder of low-mass exoplanets to date. Since April 2008, HARPS has been the only instrument available at the 3.6 m telescope. = New Technology Telescope = NTT telescope. The ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) is an Alt-Az, 3.58-metre Richey-Chretien telescope which pioneered the use of active optics. The telescope and its enclosure had a revolutionary design for optimal image quality. NTT saw first light in March 1989. The telescope chamber is ventilated by a system of flaps which optimize the air flow across the NTT optimizing the dome and mirror seeing. To prevent heat input to the building, all motors in the telescope are water cooled and all the electronics boxes are insulated and cooled. The primary mirror of the NTT is actively controlled to preserve its figure at all telescope positions. The secondary mirror position is also actively controlled in three directions. The optimized airflow, the thermal controls, and the active optics give the excellent image quality of the NTT. Note that the NTT has active instead of adaptive optics: it corrects the defects and deformation of the telescope and mirror, but does not correct the turbulence; it ensures that the optics is always in perfect shape. Together with the thermal control, it allows the NTT to reach the ambient seeing, but it does not improve it. = MPG/ESO 2.2 m Telescope = MPG/ESO, ESO Schmidt, NTT, and ESO 3.6 telescopes (left to right). The 2.2-metre telescope has been in operation at La Silla since early 1984, and is on indefinite loan to ESO from the Max Planck Society ( or MPG). Telescope time is shared between MPG and ESO observing programmes, while the operation and maintenance of the telescope are ESO's responsibility. However, due to a new agreement between the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) and ESO, the instrument is operated by MPG until the end of September 2016. The telescope hosts three instruments: the 67-million pixel Wide Field Imager with a field of view as large as the full Moon, which has taken many amazing images of celestial objects; GROND, the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector, which chases the afterglows of the most powerful explosions in the Universe, known as gamma-ray bursts; and the high-resolution spectrograph, FEROS, used to make detailed studies of stars. MPG's 2.2-metre telescope in La Silla also has a twin brother located at the Calar Alto Observatory in southern Spain. = Other telescopes = La Silla also hosts several national and project telescopes not operated by ESO. Among them are the Swiss Euler Telescope, the Danish National Telescope and the REM, TRAPPIST and TAROT telescopes.  ESO Schmidt telescope  : The ESO 1-metre Schmidt telescope, is a Schmidt telescope designed to provide a wide field of view of the sky‚Äîequivalent to about the area of 64 full Moons. Commissioned in 1971, it was one of the first telescopes operational at La Silla and was still using photographic plates at the time. These plates later confirmed the rediscovery of long-lost asteroids such as 1179 Mally and 843 Nicolaia. : In 2009, the telescope was dedicated to the LaSilla‚ÄìQuest Variability Survey, by Yale's Department of Astronomy, and has since been used for astronomical surveys focused on the discovery of new Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), periodic variable stars, and supernovas. : Yales's 160-megapixel QUEST camera consists of a mosaic of 112 CCDs and covers about sixteen square degrees. This enables the remotely controlled project telescope to observe about a third of the night sky every four days. The La Silla‚ÄìQUEST survey with the Schmidt telescope corresponds to the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey that was carried out in the Northern Hemisphere and led to the discovery of several trans-Neptunian objects and centaurs. In 1996, the telescope imaged 7968 Elst‚ÄìPizarro with a previously unseen cometary tail, which spawned a new class of celestial bodies called main-belt comet.  Euler telescope  : The Euler Telescope is a 1.2-metre telescope built and operated by the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland. It uses the CORALIE spectrograph to conduct high-precision radial velocity measurements, also known as the wobble method, primarily in the search for large extrasolar planets in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its first discovery was a planet orbiting Gliese 86. Other observing programmes focus on variable stars, asteroseismology, gamma-ray bursts, monitoring active galactic nuclei and gravitational lenses.  MASCARA  : MASCARA, the Multi-site all-sky camera station saw first light in July 2017. Built and operated by the Dutch Leiden University, the instrument is dedicated to search for exoplanets. MASCARA has a sibling station for the Northern hemisphere at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in Spain.  REM telescope  : The Rapid Eye Mount telescope (REM) is a small rapid-reaction automatic telescope with a primary mirror. The telescope, in an altazimuth mount, began operation in October 2002. The primary purpose of the telescope is to follow the afterglow of the GRBs detected by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite.  TAROT  : The Quick-action telescope for transient objects, TAROT () is a very fast- moving optical robotic telescope able to observe a gamma-ray burst from its beginning. Satellites detecting GRBs send signals to TAROT, which can provide a sub-arc second position to the astronomical community. Data from the TAROT telescope is also useful in studying the evolution of GRBs, the physics of a fireball and its surrounding material. It is operated from the Haute-Provence Observatory in France.  Danish 1.54m Telescope  : The 1.54-metre Danish National Telescope was built by Grubb-Parsons and has been in use at La Silla since 1979. The telescope has an off-axis mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chr√©tien design. Because of the telescope's mount and limited space inside the dome, it has significant pointing restrictions.  TRAPPIST  : The Belgian robotic TRAPPIST, the TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope‚ÄìSouth, is a joint venture between the University of Li√®ge and Geneva Observatory. The 0.60-metre telescope is specialized in comets and exoplanets, and was one of the few telescopes that observed a stellar occultation of the dwarf planet Eris, revealing that it may be smaller than Pluto. It has recently gained fame following the discovery and categorisation of TRAPPIST-1, a planet system of seven near-earth like planets orbiting an ultra-cool dwarf star. = Former telescopes = The following telescopes have now been decommissioned: * Bochum 0.61-metre Telescope (National telescope) * Coud√© Auxiliary 1.47-m Telescope (CAT), adjacent to ESO 3.6 Telescope * Danish 0.5-metre Telescope (National telescope) * Dutch 0.9-metre Telescope (National telescope) * Grand Prism Objectif (GPO) Telescope * ESO 0.5-metre telescope (now at the Observatorio UC in Santiago, Chile) * ESO 1-metre telescope (1966‚Äì1994), used for DENIS 1996‚Äì2001 * ESO 1.52-metre telescope * Marly 1-metre Telescope * Marseille 0.4-metre Telescope (National telescope) * Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST), 15-metre * Swiss T70 telescope (1980‚Äì1998, now home of TRAPPIST) * Swiss 0.4-metre telescope (1975‚Äì1980, replaced by T70) The Swiss T70 telescope was a 70 cm aperture telescope for photometry that had a first light in 1980. It retired in 1998, when the Euler Telescope was commissioned. The Swiss T70 was a Cassegrain reflector design mounted on an Equatorial fork mount. It was equipped with a P7 Photometer, an replaced the Swiss 0.4-metre telescope, which was in use from November 1975 until March 1980. As with the Euler Telescope, the Swiss T70 and 0.4-metre telescopes were operated by the Geneva Observatory. Scientific discoveries About 300 scientific papers based on observations taken at La Silla are published each year. The HARPS spectrograph has found a large number of low- mass extrasolar planets. It detected the planets within the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains what may be the first known rocky planet in a habitable zone, outside the Solar System. Several telescopes at La Silla played a crucial role in linking gamma-ray bursts‚Äîthe most energetic explosions in the Universe since the Big Bang‚Äîwith the explosions of massive stars. Since 1987, the ESO La Silla Observatory has also played an important role in the study and follow-up of the nearest recent supernova, SN 1987A.  Signs of a pre-Hispanic culture  The delicate central spiral symbolizes a serpent while the rest of the space is taken up by strange little figures, together with some simple geometric motifs and quadrupeds. Hundreds of rock engravings, also called petroglyphs, can be found all around La Silla. These are attributed to the El Molle culture. The El Molle culture have their origin as hunter-gatherers that developed a new way of life based on horticulture and village life. They are known for their pottery and body ornaments, such as necklaces and the tembet√°s. There are three types of petroglyph designs at La Silla: human and animal figures, abstract geometrical designs and purely ornamental ensembles. Beside the petroglyphs there exists also a stone circle near La Silla, which is suggested as a astronomical tool. Three rocks aligned during the El Molle culture with Alpha Carinae, Beta Carinae and Alpha Centauri or Beta Centauri. This alignment occurred during late April and during May and could signal the beginning of the cold season. Farmers could have used this tool to determine when to move their herds, mostly camelidae, into their villages. There are signs of illicit excavations at La Silla since the 1990s and in 2017 some vandalism was discovered. Another ESO site with archaeological testimonies in its vicinity is the ALMA site.
