After a tip from the IRA, her body was found buried across the border in a field in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, County Sligo, Ireland, on 30 June 1992. She had been beaten to death. Her murder has never been solved. Background Margaret Perry was a civil servant, working at Training and Employment in Lisburn. A Catholic, she lived with her widowed mother, Mary, at Churchill Park, Portadown. She disappeared on 21 June 1991, after she crossed the border into the Republic of Ireland to visit her boyfriend, Gregory Burns, who was hospitalised in Monaghan. A year later, on 30 June 1992, acting on a tip-off from the IRA via a local priest, the Garda found her body not far from Mullaghmore. She had been strangled and beaten to death with a spade, then buried in a shallow grave in a forest not far from the former estate of the late Lord Mountbatten. Deaths of Burns, Dignam, Starrs In June 1992, shortly after the recovery of Perry's body, the PIRA admitted responsibility for the killing of three men, whose bodies were found at different roadsides in County Armagh. The IRA claimed the men, all members of the IRA, were undercover agents for MI5 and the RUC Special Branch. The IRA had tried and executed them, leaving their naked, hooded bodies in ditches. The bodies bore evidence of torture and each had a single bullet wound to the back of the head. They were Gregory Burns (aged 33), John Dignam (aged 32) and Aidan Starrs (aged 29), all natives of Portadown. The IRA justified the killings by stating they were guilty of the abduction and murder of Perry. They claimed that Burns had had an affair with Perry. The IRA claimed she threatened to expose his group's intelligence links, so the men kidnapped and murdered her. As the bodies might have been booby-trapped, they were left in place overnight. The killings were the first to occur during an eight-week span in Northern Ireland, during peace talks. Allegations by An Phoblacht It was later claimed, through an article in the Sinn F√©in newspaper An Phoblacht, Dignam had been detained by the RUC over Perry's disappearance in the summer of 1991. During interrogation, it was claimed, he confessed to her murder and implicated the other two men as well. The newspaper claimed that instead of arresting the three men, they were recruited as informers for the Force Research Unit, and that the man in charge of their interrogation and executions was Freddie Scappaticci, another FRU agent who had infiltrated the IRA's Internal Security Unit. The newspaper also claimed Gregory Burns had been a paid agent of MI5 for the past 13 years, since they recruited him in Enniskillen. It was alleged he had been an aide to Owen Carron, election worker for Bobby Sands, and that Gregory Burns' had arranged the killing of his own brother, Sean, in 1982, in one of the \\"shoot-to-kill\\" controversies of the 1980s. It was alleged that Burns had been instrumental in foiling many IRA operations in Northern Ireland. According to the newspaper report, he wanted to break up with Perry, his girlfriend at the time, but was fearful she would reveal that he had told her he was working for British Intelligence. Burns consulted his handlers, who agreed that he, Dignam and Starrs should get out before they were uncovered. But the head of the FRU ‚Äì Brigadier Gordon Kerr ‚Äì refused, telling Burns to clear up his personal mess. Burns replied that if he and his comrades were not pulled out by the FRU, he would certainly have to kill Perry. Burns travelled to Sligo to undergo a minor arm operation in June 1991. On 21 June, Dignam and Starrs drove Perry to Sligo, ostensibly to see Burns, but outside Mullaghmore she was strangled and beaten to death with a spade, burying her in a shallow forest grave. The allegations against the three in An Phoblacht were denied by their family and supporters, who believed the three were set up. Burns' father, Jim Burns, stated he did not believe Gregory had anything to do with his own brother's death in 1982. The British newspaper The Guardian reported there were contradictions in the IRA's version of events. Investigations into Perry's disappearance by Sunday World reporter Martin O'Hagan prompted IRA interest. Freddie Scappaticci and his unit interrogated Burns, Dignam and Starrs the following year, leading to their deaths. Taped confessions by the three men recorded by Scappaticci were later played to Peter Taylor in his BBC documentary. The IRA gave information to a Sligo priest that led to Perry's body being recovered. Three days later, after nearly two weeks interrogation, the three men were found dumped in County Armagh. All bore evidence of torture. After Dignam's funeral, a letter by him was given to his pregnant wife: > I have only a matter of hours to live. I only wish I could see you and the > kids one last time, but as you know, this is not possible.

Sarcophyton glaucum belongs to the phylum Cnidaria, the class Anthozoa, and the family Alcyoniidae. S. glaucum belongs to the genus Sarcophyton, which is one of seven known genera of Alcyoniidae. In the Red Sea, S. glaucum is one of the most prevalent soft corals of the family Alcyoniidae. The Red Sea is the native home to 40% of the known 180 species of soft corals. Soft corals like S. glaucum of the family Alcyonniidae do not have a hard exoskeleton. They are sedentary and taxonomically identified by calcareous sclerites on their exoskeletons. Sarcophyton have polyps with eight tentacles. Sarcophyton corals build monospecific colonies, typically found in a range of intertidal, subtidal, and near-shore reef flat habitats. Individual S. glaucum corals grow up to 80 cm usually on reef flats, in lagoons and on seaward slopes.WoRMS - World Register of Marine Species - Sarcophyton glaucum (Quoy & Gaimard, 1833)Leather Coral (Sarcophyton glaucum) - Information on Leather Coral - Encyclopedia of Life Within the biodiverse and productive organisms of the rough leather coral are many microorganisms which provide benefits to the coral host. The microorganisms living on S. glaucum protect the host against pathogens, while also possibly supplying nutrients to the host.  Research  Coral of the genus Sarcophyton are used often for research in the pharmaceutical industry. S. glaucum is a producer of sarcophytol A, a diterpenoid recognized to possess tumor-inhibiting bioactivity. Analysis of the cembranoids within S. glaucum have shown that they are tumor-inhibiting. The metabolites of S. glaucum were also shown to be antimicrobial, antifungal, and neuroprotective. The study ‚ÄúBioactive cembranoids from the Red Sea soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum‚Äù concluded that several isolated compounds from S. glaucum samples can be further investigated for cancer research and treatment. Other studies have also shown antibacterial properties of S. glaucum. In a study titled ‚ÄúPhylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activity of marine bacteria associated with the soft coral Sarcophyton glaucum,‚Äù the authors investigated the bacterial properties of S. glaucum. The authors found that soft corals like S. glaucum can be used to screen for bacteria that is antibiotic-producing. They identified many antimicrobial properties within the bacteria of S. glaucum, such as bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, Gamma proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Chemical analyses of 16 different species of Sarcophyton revealed a range of other biological activities. S. glaucum has many cembrane terpenes. Terpenes of the genus Sarcophyton protect against insects and pests, inflammation, viruses, and biofouling. S. glaucum is a prominent coral used in aquaculture. The species S. glaucum can be separated into six clades, differentiated by the sequence analyses of mitochondrial proteins, according to a study by Costa et. al. The study ‚ÄúPhotobiology and growth of leather coral Sarcophyton cf. glaucum fragments stocked under low light in a recirculated system‚Äù tested how changing the intensity of light, a necessary component to sustain coral health and productivity, affects S. glaucum growth and survival. Results from a study of the effects of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) treatments on S. glaucum stated that the soft coral species was able to grow and survive in low PAR intensities. The photobiology of S. glaucum was not negatively affected in low PAR intensities, while the concentration of coral endosymbionts increased under these conditions. The results suggest that low PAR can be used in ex situ culturing of S. glaucum.

Some ampelographers have speculated that the grape may have originated on the French island of Corsica where the grape shares a close genetic relationship with the Corsican wine grape Biancu Gentile (also known as just Biancone).J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 105 Allen Lane 2012 History The island of Elba where Biancone di Portoferraio is grown is located between the French island of Corsica and Tuscany. While Biancone di Portoferraio is today found almost exclusively on the Italian island of Elba, ampelographers suspect that the grape may have French origins with DNA analysis in the early 21st century revealing that the grape has a potential parent-offspring relationship with the Corsican wine grape Biancu Gentile (Biancone). Further analysis revealed the red Tuscan wine grape Mammolo as another potential parent and listed the Italian grape varieties of Caloria, Colombana nera and Pollera nera as potential half-siblings. Viticulture and confusion with other grapes Biancone di Portoferraio is a late ripening grape variety that is often one of the last grapes in Tuscany to be harvested during the growing season. Due to similarities in appearance and synonyms, the grape is often confused with the Corsican grape Biancu Gentile (which may be a parent variety) and the Ligurian wine grape Rollo. Wine regions Biancone di Portoferaio is most often found in generic white table wines from Elba. While some plantings of Biancone di Portoferraio may have previously existed on Corsica, where the grape was known as Biancone and Uva bianca, today the grape is found almost exclusively on the island of Elba located in the Tyrrhenian Sea between Corsica and the Tuscan coast.

It is variously known as the spotted maize beetle, or pollen beetle. It is indigenous to Argentina and neighbouring countries, but has been accidentally imported into various other regions such as the warmer regions of North America and much of Africa, where it has become invasive. Description Adult Astylus atromaculatus are roughly oval in shape, slightly elongated, with parallel sides. They generally are slightly flat in shape, and like most Melyridae, tend to be soft and leathery in texture. They attain about 12 mm in bodily length by 5 mm wide. They are finely bristly with finely punctured elytra and upper surfaces. The body colour is generally black, but with pale hairs on the pronotum surrounding two large, eye-like dorsal black patches. However, the most conspicuous feature is the colour scheme of the elytra; they are yellow to orange with a black median stripe along their margins where the folded elytra meet. Two blotches on that median stripe form cross-marks, one about 2 mm from the anterior end of the line, and one about 1 mm from the posterior end. Each elytron has three much larger black blotches on its dorsolateral surface near its lateral margin. The filiform antennae have eleven antennomeres. The larvae are covered with long, silky setae, brown to reddish in colour.Astylus atromaculatus. National Pest Surveillance and Monitoring Systems - SENASA (Health and Quality Agrifood National Service) Biology The adult Astylus atromaculatus are herbivorous, particularly being attracted to flowers and feeding on pollen. In this role they are not much of an agricultural problem and for some crops, such as sunflowers, it is suggested that they are more beneficial as pollinators than they are harmful as crop pests. In particular they feed on pollen from wind-pollinated plants such as maize, sorghum and other grain crops in the Poaceae, and also various Cyperaceae. During the high season they may crowd inflorescences at certain times of the day. The larvae might be more harmful, feeding in the ground on decaying plant matter, but also feeding on seeds and germinating seedlings. On the other hand, in South Africa they have been reported to be minor predators of stem borers in grain sorghum and maize.ARC-Plant Protection Research Institute (ARC-PPRI) Natural Enemies of Cereal Stemborers Especially in the countries where they are invasive and where presumably their natural enemies are absent, Astylus atromaculatus may become sufficiently numerous to cause significant crop damage. However, it is arguable whether it is ever worth applying special pest control treatments, rather than at most modifying other routine applications to accommodate their control. There is however a concern that infestations could seriously damage rice harvests by causing apparent sterility; unlike the situation in maize, in which the male and female flowers are separate, rice female flowers can be seriously damaged by pollen-feeding beetles. Veterinary significance Like possibly all Melyridae, Astylus atromaculatus is undoubtedly poisonous; livestock deaths have resulted from swallowing large numbers of beetles in their fodder or in pastures. Though this is not a routine event, it has been confirmed by actual investigation, for example when cattle on the Springbok flats in South Africa ingested heavily infested pasture. The beetle populations commonly peak during midsummer and autumn, when they feed mainly on pollen from grain crops. When there are too few crops such as sunflowers and maize, the beetles are prone to concentrate on grasses, and on forbs in flower. Poisoning caused severe diarrhoea with dark faeces and large quantities of mucus, rapidly followed by weakness and stasis of the rumen. Post mortem, beetles were found in large numbers in the rumen, associated with symptoms of dramatic congestion and irritation of the abomasum and haemorrhagic pseudomembranous intestinal enteritis. Because no treatment has proven effective for severely poisoned animals, it is necessary to keep livestock out of pastures while the plants are full of beetles, typically in the cool of mornings and evenings while the insects are inactive and not prone to scatter when alarmed by grazing activities. Yellow trays of detergent solution have been shown to trap the beetles, though it is not clear that they are an effective measure in reducing heavy infestations.Annual Report 1 April 1991 to 31 March 1992, South African Department of Agriculture, Directorate of Animal Health.Van den Berg, J., Torto, B., Pickett, J.

Biography It is possible that Nimlot was a son of king Osorkon III of the 23rd Dynasty, and is likely that he was installed as a governor of Hermopolis by this king, around 754 BCE. He was married to a \\"queen\\", Nestanetmeh, and proclaimed himself King around 749 BCE. At the time of Nimlot's rule, the Kushite king and pharaoh Piye was launching a campaign of conquest against Middle and Lower Egypt (c. 729‚Äì728 BCE).Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 325-7 At first, Nimlot was an ally/vassal of Piye, but later he pulled back and joined the coalition led by Tefnakht. This volte-face caused Piye's immediate reaction: he marched northward and besieged Hermopolis until Nimlot's capitulation. After the conquest of the city, Nimlot had to give rich tributes to Piye as a compensation for his defection, including a horse and a precious sistrum; Piye, a great lover of horses, was also extremely disappointed to find Nimlot's stables in poor state, and harshly scolded him for the neglect.T.G.H. James, op. cit., pp. 684ff. After Nimlot's submission, the situation turned more favorable for Piye, and he managed to defeat Tefnakht's coalition. On Piye's Victory stele, Nimlot is one of the four Delta kings subdued by the Nubian conqueror ‚Äì the others are Iuput II of Leontopolis, Osorkon IV of Tanis and Peftjauawybast of Herakleopolis; among the quartet, Nimlot is depicted standing instead of kneeling,Alan B. Lloyd (ed), A companion of Ancient Egypt, vol. 1, Wiley-Blackwell 2010, p. 135. since Piye chose him as interlocutor, while the others were considered \\"impure\\", due to the fact that they ate fishes. Nimlot's charges were reconfirmed by Piye before the latter's return in the South. Later, around 725 BCE, Nimlot was succeeded by Djehutyemhat. Nimlot should not be confused with his later successor called Nimlot E (or Lamintu in Akkadian) who was ruling the city of Hermopolis when the Assyrians led by Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt in 667/666 BCE.Kitchen, op. cit., ¬ß 358.

It opened in 1908 as the Hotel Majestic and was converted to government offices in 1936. The hotel served as a field hospital for wounded officers during World War I, staffed largely by British aristocrats. During World War II, it served as the headquarters of the German military high command in France during the German occupation of Paris. The building played a pivotal role in the deportation of Parisian Jews and the 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler. The building reopened as The Peninsula Paris in August 2014, following a complicated and costly restoration. History =Early history of the site= Avenue Kl√©ber, part of Baron Haussmann's rebuilding plan for Paris, was originally known as l'avenue du Roi de Rome in tribute to Napoleon I‚Äôs son, the Roi de Rome. In 1864, a rich Russian nobleman named Alexander Basilewski (de) constructed a palace at 19 avenue du Roi de Rome, designed by architect Cl√©ment Parent.The Making of the Peninsula Paris by Daniel Jeffreys at www.thepeninsula-paris.com Basilewski sold the palace in 1868 to the Duke of Sesto, who renamed it the Palacio Castilla. It was bought on behalf of Queen Isabella II of Spain, who had just been exiled from Spain following the Glorious Revolution. The Duke of Sesto had preceded the queen to France and arranged for her welcome by Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie. The Duke of Sesto and Eugenie had known one another since they were teenagers in Madrid. The Palacio Castilla was used as the queen's home in exile, and it was where the Duke of Sesto and Queen Isabel II plotted to have her son Prince Alfonso elevated to the Spanish throne. The duke talked Queen Isabel II into abdicating on June 20, 1870, the ceremony taking place at Palacio Castilla in the presence of as many Spanish grandees as could be brought to Paris for the ceremony. The queen's abdication led toward France's declaration of war against Prussia less than a month later. Queen Isabel II continued to live in Paris, while the Duke of Sesto succeeded in arousing support in Spain for Prince Alfonso, who was welcomed into Madrid in 1875 as King Alfonso XII. However, he died at the age of 28 of tuberculosis, and he was succeeded by his son Alfonso XIII as an infant under the regency of his mother Queen Maria Cristina. Queen Isabel II continued to live in Paris until her death in 1904. The property was then acquired by hotel magnate Leonard Tauber after a bidding war that involved the United States government and the King of Belgium. Nancy Becker, \\"Moments of Extraordinary Violence and Intensity,\\" Denver, Outskirts Press, 2012. =Hotel Majestic = World War I and the inter-war years Tauber constructed the luxurious Hotel Majestic on the site, retaining Queen Isabella's bathroom accoutrements, including her marble bath, in the Presidential suite. Designed by Armand Sibien, construction began in 1906 and the hotel opened in December 1908. The hotel was purchased by Henry Devenish Harben for use as a military hospital at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and served in this capacity for five months. It was damaged during its hospital service, and was not renovated and reopened until 1916. In 1922 it was the site of a famous dinner hosted by Violet and Sydney Schiff and attended by Marcel Proust, Igor Stravinsky and Pablo Picasso. The \\"dinner party of the century\\": was immortalised in Richard Davenport-Hines's book, \\"Proust at the Majestic: The Last Days of the Author Whose Book Changed Paris\\". The 1st unofficial Chess Olympiad was held at the hotel in 1924. George Gershwin wrote An American in Paris while staying at the hotel in 1928. World War II The hotel was purchased by the French government in 1936 to serve as offices for the Ministry of Defence. It served as the headquarters of the German military high command in France (Milit√§rbefehlshaber Frankreich) from October 1940 to July 1944 during the occupation of Paris in World War II. During the Nazi Occupation of Paris, staff army officials at The Majestic fought fierce battles with the Gestapo and the SS over policy, especially with regard to the deportation of Jews to concentration camps, reprisals against French partisans and protection of works of Art in French museums. The Majestic became known as a centre of opposition to certain aspects of Adolf Hitler's policies, especially when Carl-Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel took charge of administering the Milit√§rbefehlshaber Frankreich.Walter Bargatzky, Hotel Majestic: Ein Deutscher im besetzten Frankreich On May 22, 1942 after the Wannsee conference an exclusive presentation was made to the higher echelons of the German army at the Hotel Majestic by Reinhard Heydrich, one of the main architects of the Holocaust. He spoke of experimentsArriv√©e du G√©n√©ral des SS Heydrich par Les Actualit√©s Mondiales at Ina.fr for the killing of Jews using a specially prepared truck whose exhaust fumes would kill the deportees. In this context the word ‚Äúgassing‚Äù was first used outside of Hitler's inner circle in relation to the extermination of the Jewish population of Paris. On this occasion, Heydrich introduced Carl Oberg, the new police and SS officer for Paris, who had been issued with the authority to order deportations of Jews without reference to the military commander of the French authorities. Milit√§rbefehlshaber Frankreich staff at The Majestic were soon processing hundreds of deportation orders against the Jewish population of Paris. Joseph Goebbels established his Paris propaganda headquarters at the Majestic around the same time and the building's staff assumed control of the notorious Camp Royallieu at Compi√®gne, know to the Germans as Frontstalag 122, which served as a feeder station for the extermination camps at Auschwitz, Ravensbr√ºck, Buchenwald and Dachau.Charles Glass, Americans in Paris: Life and Death Under Nazi Occupation St√ºlpnagel opposed the policy and decided to act against Hitler. With other members of the officer class working out of The Majestic and billeted in The Raphael next door, St√ºlpnagel began to plan Hitler's assassination from his office on The Majestic's second floor. On 20 July 1944, St√ºlpnagel's co-conspirator Claus von Stauffenberg made his assassination attempt on Hitler at the Wolfsschanze in East Prussia. For his part, St√ºlpnagel put his part of the plot into operation from The Majestic, ordering Hans Otfried von Linstow to round up all SS and Gestapo officers in Paris and imprison them. These events were witnessed by Walter Bargatzky, a high ranking German officer who wrote \\"Hotel Majestic: Ein Deutscher im besetzten Frankreich\\" and was a supporter of the plot to kill Hitler. After the plot failed, Bargatzky left his office at The Majestic and returned to room 409 in The Raphael to await his arrest. It never came and like other fringe members of the plot, Bargatzky was allowed to serve out the war at The Majestic. The final battle for The Majestic took place on 25 August in the afternoon as Jaques Massu and Colonel Paul de Langlande of the 2nd Armored Division (France) moved their troops from the Champs-√âlys√©es to the heavily fortified and barricaded Avenue Kleber.Free France's Lion: The Life of Philippe Leclerc, de Gaulle's Greatest General by William Mortimer Moore One of Massu's officers worked his way around the rear of The Majestic on Rue la Perouse, which was protected by a blockhouse that could only be subdued by a bazooka, but the Germans inside the hotel said they would be willing to surrender to regular soldiers, rather than men of the Resistance. A German spokesman was brought to Massu under a white flag and with Langland'e approval, Massu went to The Majestic accompanied by Senior Sergeant Dannic. As they approached Dannic was shot dead by a sniper firing from the hotel's rooftop. Despite this, Massu continued up the hotel's steps and entered The Majestic's lobby to find fifty German officers and 300 other ranks. The Germans surrendered to Massu without further resistance, using a bilingual bell-boy from the hotel as their interpreter. Post-war government offices In the post war-era The Majestic served as the first headquarters of UNESCO, from September 16, 1946 until 1958, when it was converted into a conference center for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, known as the International Conference Center. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was founded at the hotel in 1960 and it was the location for the signing of the Paris Peace Accords on January 27, 1973 that ended American involvement in the Vietnam War. Later, on October 23, 1991, the 1991 Paris Peace Accords, which ended the Cambodian-Vietnamese War and Khmer Rouge civil war, were also signed there. =The Peninsula Paris= The French government sold the building in 2008 as part of a cost-cutting measure to the Qatari Diar firm for $460 million. It reopened on August 1, 2014, following extensive rebuilding by Vinci Construction costing EUR338 million, as The Peninsula Paris, the famous hotel chain's first property in Europe, in a joint venture with Katara Hospitality. The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited, parent company of Peninsula Hotels, owns a 20% interest in the property. The architectural designs were by Richard Martinet of Affine architecture & interior design, while the interiors were by Henry Leung of Hong Kong-based Chhada Siembieda & Associates Ltd. The hotel offers 200 luxury rooms, including 34 suites. 21 avenue Kl√©ber The Second Empire building was acquired in 2013 by The Peninsula Hotels and located next to Peninsula Paris.

The technique is ancient, but is still appropriate in developing countries where labor costs are low and material costs are high. Antiquity Hand-dug wells are mentioned in the Bible. Inscriptions in Mesopotamia tell of construction of brick-lined wells in the period before the rule of Sargon of Akkad (c. 2334 ‚Äì 2279 BC). Brick- lined wells have been excavated at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley. Mature Harappan (2600‚Äì1900 BC) technology included brick-lined wells, perhaps derived from earlier designs. One well would have served a neighborhood. The clay bricks are trapezoidal in shape, with one end smaller than the other. The bricks are arranged in circles pointing inward. The smaller ends form the inside walls. In the settlement of Lothal a brick-lined building on an elevated mound included a well lined with baked bricks, a bathing facility and a drain. The Crow and the Pitcher by Wenceslaus Hollar (1607‚Äì1677) Brick-lined wells of more recent date have been found around the world. They have been found in Sanjan, Gujarat, India, built around the 11th century AD. Archeological excavations in Virginia, USA, have found what appears to be a brick-lined well from the 17th century. Brick-lined wells were typical of 19th century farmsteads in rural Illinois. In the Shijiazhuang area of Hebei, China, irrigation using wells was highly developed before the Revolution. Five or six men could dig a brick-lined well with a depth of in a week. This could irrigate crops over an area of up to 20 mu. The same men could dig an unlined well in one day, basically a pit in the ground, but the irrigation capacity was only one fifth of that of the brick-lined well. Comparison to other linings In West Africa branches were traditionally used to line hand-dug wells, but this requires use of forest resources that are now often scarce. Old steel barrels can be used to make linings. These can be lowered from the surface as the well is dug and reduce risk when the well is sunk in sand, gravel or some other unstable formation. However, they corrode and deform easily. Cement brick linings are stronger, unlikely to deform, and the courses can be linked structurally. They are generally cost- effective, although more expensive than barrel linings. Steel-reinforced wells are stronger again and can be sunk much deeper, but in developing countries their cost is usually prohibitive. Pre-cast concrete pipe is also an excellent liner, particularly if it has tongue-in-groove joints and a smooth exterior, since it can be used as a crib as the well is deepened. Again, cost may prohibit its use. Design The brick lining will typically rest on a circular concrete well curb. The lining may have open joints to allow water to enter. In this case the well is often plugged at the bottom and the water enters from the sides. Ballast of diameter is packed around the outside of the lining to prevent sand from flowing into the well. This design may be used in gravel or coarse sand where the water table is shallow. Impervious wells are made using masonry with cement or lime mortar. They may be sunk deep. Water seeps into a cavity in the open bottom, or comes up from a pipe sunk down from the center of the well into the water-bearing sand. The top part of the well should prevent foreign matter or surface water from entering the well, so should be impervious. The top of the well should be protected and the area around the well drained. The brick lining can greatly improve sanitation if it rises above ground level, preventing contamination of the well water by animal feces. Peace Corps experience A trapezoidal shape may be used for bricks made to line wells By 2007 the U.S. Peace Corps had been promoting use of Dutch bricks to build soak pits and wells for many years. The Peace Corps uses the term \\"Dutch brick\\" to describe a trapezoidal (as opposed to rectangular) concrete brick used to line a well or soak pit. The brick may be made of a 1:2:3 mix of cement, sand and gravel. USAID has supported these efforts, for example providing funds to purchase materials such as cement and rebar for construction of Dutch brick wells in Mali and Mauretania. The Dutch bricks are used to reinforce the sides of the wells, with the concrete mixed onsite and packed into brick molds. Dutch bricks made for well lining have a trapezoidal shape, with sloping sides so that they can be fitted into a ring. The slope can be adjusted for larger or smaller rings. Lining wells with Dutch bricks in this way allows the well to be dug deeper without fear of the walls collapsing. Problems may however be encountered with incorrectly shaped molds and inexperienced volunteers.

Early life and apprenticeships  Arthur Dyson was born in Inglewood, California, on February 24, 1940, son of Harry and Thyra Dyson. This well-illustrated book is the principal available source for information regarding the early decades of work by Dyson. While still in high school, he had a paid position in the architectural firm of Bartoli and Skinner from 1957 to 1958. On June 21, 1958, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner published a photograph of Dyson reporting his acceptance as an apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright in the Taliesin Fellowship. Although Dyson would have less than a year in the Taliesin studio before Wright died, a comment during that time from Wright led Dyson to a subsequent internship with Bruce Goff, someone Life magazine reported to be ‚Äúone of the few US architects whom Frank Lloyd Wright considers creative.‚Äù Reflecting on his brief but profound experience with Wright, Dyson said, \\"My own apprenticeship was with the truth of organic architecture so profoundly matured in the Master of Frank Lloyd Wright\\"Guggenheimer, Tobias, A Taliesin Legacy: The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright's Apprentices. New York, 1995 John Wiley and Sons pp 49. From 1959 to 1961, Dyson lived and worked at the Goff office in the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Goff presented Dyson with a catalog from an exhibition of the work of Purcell and Elmslie, an important American organic architecture firm active from 1907 to 1921 Returning to his native state, Dyson discovered William Gray Purcell was living in Pasadena, California. Purcell hired Dyson as his personal assistant and draftsman from 1962 to 1963. The two men spent much of their time together reviewing the architectural records of Purcell and Elmslie, discussing progressive design principles.Hammons, p. 14. Like that of Frank Lloyd Wright, the office of Purcell and Elmslie descended directly from the seminal architectural firm of Louis Sullivan. In this way, Dyson carries a unique continuity from the Sullivan office through mentorship from Wright and Purcell.  Career  = 1960s - 1970s = Opening an independent practice first in Los Gatos, California and then for a time in Monterey, California, Dyson moved eventually to Fresno, California in 1969. There he established the office of Arthur Dyson and Associates that remains his base of operations. Even before leaving the Goff office, Dyson conceived some of his earliest projects on a large scale and using innovative technologies. The Carlson Apartment Building project (1959) proposed a 17-story, 36 unit concrete and glass tower designed to overlook the Pacific Ocean at Santa Monica, California. The Cannery Row Hotel project (1966) for a site in Monterey, California further developed the grammar of a multi-story residential tower.Hammons, p. 26. The subsequent 27 story Chamlian Plaza Hotel project (1979) in Fresno, California, featured a sophisticated system of suspended structural engineering, prefabricated construction, and a skin of automated solar tempering for guest rooms that virtually eliminated the possibility of being trapped by fire.Hammons, p. 48. The Westrend Visitors Center complex project (1972) for a tourist area adjacent to a main highway in the San Joaquin Valley suggested innovative use of textile in a massive circular canopy supported by a spar tower, a creative structural technique that decades later would be adopted by prominent architects.Hammons, p. 17, 37-38. Residential work provided the most opportunities for construction. Like many organic architects Dyson could encounter difficulties in realizing individually expressive forms when confronted by the demands of conservative building codes, contractors used to bidding on more familiar building forms, and other obstacles. For example, plans for the Lynn Studio and Residence (1965) at a site in Carmel, California, pleased the client greatly but remained unbuilt due to resistance toward financing such a unique design.Hammons, p. 12. However, a number of built houses won attention in local press and international architectural publications, as well as accumulated design awards. One of the most important of these was the Geringer residence (1979) in Kerman, California. Set amid the long straight lines of a commercial vineyard, Dyson turned the house in on itself as a circular form centered on a swimming pool to establish a relaxing vista shared by the main living areas. The Geringer house was later published as an exemplar of former Taliesin apprentices who were expressing the organic design philosophy in fresh, creative works. Dyson also received recognition for the United Packing Company Building [later Fullerton, Lang, Reichert & Patch offices] (1979), a commercial office building in Fresno, California.Hammons, pp. 54-57. From the very start of his professional practice as an architect Dyson sought to demonstrate architecture as a force for community good, particularly in an unpublicized commitment to bring professional architectural services to the causes of the culturally disadvantaged. Notable unbuilt projects during this period include the Monterey Institute for the Arts project (1966) in Pacific Grove, California, and the American Indian Center project (1975) in Fresno, California, a museum facility done pro bono to showcase objects relating the history of the Mono and Yokuts people of central California.Hammons, p. 15. In 1971, Dyson developed two schemes for a publicly subsidized children's center constructed in Orange Cove, California that combined both a Head Start and day care operation.Hammons, p. 30, 32-33. By serving at this same time as chairman of the Urban Planning Task Force in Fresno, Dyson commenced a lifelong journey in public service. He also began to lecture at colleges, universities, and museums as outreach for progressive design principles.Hammons, p. 11. = 1980s = Although commissions were executed for other kinds of structures, residential design dominated the output of the Dyson office during the 1980s. The Bedwell residence (1982) in Fresno, California, represents the first in a series of larger homes (5,800 square feet in this instance) produced during this decade whose massing occurs through the dynamic intersection of angular forms.Chelazzi, p. 17.Hammons, pp. 66-67. Similar broad polygonal forms established the elevations of the Wohlgemuth house (1984)Hammons, pp. 68-69. and the Simpson residence (1985), both in Fresno, California.Chelazzi, p. 19. Positioned on a low rise above stretches of commercial vineyards, the Jaksha residence (1988) in Madera County, California, featured a highly articulated expression of angular design in the floor plan, surrounding decking, and sun tempering trellises. Professional acclaim for the Jaksha design accumulated quickly and the house was published extensively, including twice in Sunset magazine. Dyson also produced buildings with arced forms. The Lencioni house (1985) in Sanger, California, produced a particularly unique two story oval form that was also widely recognized. Appearing in popular magazines, professional journals, architectural yearbooks, and most recently in a college textbook, the composition was cited by important critics such as Bruno Zevi as a superior expression of organic architectural principles. In the award- winning Barrett-Tuxford residence (1987) in Richland Center, Wisconsin, curvilinear massing was refined through the development of two successive schemes. Unfolding in shape from a natural resonance with the slope of the hillside, the curvature of the earth-enclosed foundation wall embraced an interior space divided into living, working, and sleeping areas. A terrace extruded by the use of earth from the construction excavation extended the living space into an arboreal setting of trees rooted down grade of the building. This house was also lauded by Bruno Zevi in the same article where he extolled the Lencioni house design. Two unbuilt house designs by Dyson used similar oval pod forms. The plan for the Carlson residence (1981) in Van Nuys, California, occupied an exceptionally steep building site with an integrated system of cantilevered pods. The Millerton house project (1984) in Madera County, California, for a similarly difficult site grouped the pods with a connecting bridge over a rocky cleft and also responded to an environmentally exposed position by incorporating a Teflon roof covering supported by a steel frame for thermal regulation.The Millerton project is represented in a number of publications with various renderings. See Hammons, p. 25, 75; Chelazzi, p.45. A rendering also featured on the cover of a Friends of Kebyar issue devoted to the work of Dyson. Dyson further developed a curvilinear form for the Glynns Restaurant (1984) in Fresno, California, that incorporated round light tower elements which would evolve and feature significantly in later projects.Hammons, p. 73. Public awareness of Dyson increased. The first international display of his drawings took place at the London museum of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1985, where his projects were included in an exhibit titled The American School of Architecture: The Bruce Goff Legacy. Dyson was again featured in a subsequent installation at the RIBA called 10 California Architects, at which time the RIBA acquired for their permanent collection a Dyson rendering of the Vuelos de Cobre (or Walson) residence (1990) then under construction in San Diego County, California. This on-line catalog lacks a PURL to their record for this drawing and reference to the exhibition. Search under \\"Arthur Dyson\\" from the main page. In addition to the multiple publications by Bruno Zevi about Dyson for the European audience, the Japanese architectural periodical A+U (Architecture and Urbanism) twice featured a compendium of Dyson projects illustrated in color.; and These publications coincided with an increased demand for Dyson as a speaker at universities, arts organizations, and professional societies, where he continued to express his commitment to the mutual ends of progressive design and public well being. = 1990s = Residential commissions continued to be an important activity for the Dyson office in the 1990s, but this decade saw a significant growth in substantial institutional and commercial projects. Dyson recognized the need for a collaborative office structure to support the production of drawings, approvals process, and construction administration for more complex projects like churches, schools, libraries, and similar community shared facilities. Joining with other architects who possessed special expertise in such building programs to establish a separate partnership practice eventually called DSJ Architects, Dyson became sole designing architect for the new firm. Under the arrangement, Dyson maintained a steady output of design from his personal practice, as well. The establishment of the DSJ Architects partnership led to immediate work in building houses of religious worship. Although Dyson's personal office received professional awards for a remodeling of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church (1991) in Porterville, California, that integrated functional improvements with new decorative enrichment, his participation in DSJ Architects resulted designs for new facilities for four Christian churches and a Buddhist temple. Two schemes were prepared for the United Japanese Christian Church (1991/1992) in Clovis, California, which reveal a reconception of the form between the two versions unusual in Dyson work.The first scheme is illustrated in Hammons, p. 99; the dramatic change in the church as built can be seen in many published images, e.g. see The realized building exhibits several features that continue to develop in subsequent projects, notably the sweeping simplicity of sparingly embellished space in a light filled sanctuary and an entrance embracing from high overhead the approach of worshipers with elongated steel trellis forms. In St. Mary's Catholic Church (1994) in Sanger, California, the extension of twelve wings in the entrance trellis work refers to the Christian apostles and forms a symbolic canopy over a monumental sixteen foot high statue of the Virgin Mary.Chelazzi, p. 29. The Huber Memorial Chapel for the First Congregational Church (1997) in Bakersfield, California, refines the entrance adornment into a single vector of joined steel spars jutting forward from the cornice in a visual reference to hands joined in prayer. Toward the end of the 1990s, Dyson produced the first in a series of school designs that would develop as a major activity of the DSJ Architects partnership. The Temperance-Kutner Elementary School Library (1999) in Clovis, California, introduced a curvilinear form within a narrow site on the campus of an existing school characterized by standard rectangular classroom wings. The Webster Elementary School (1999), in Fresno, California, anchored classrooms and administrative office segments with circular towers whose flowing lines foster a sense of embrace and belonging. Interior colors, textures, and lighting features both relax and stimulate mental activity. In another example of steel trellis forms used as symbolic markers, a white canopy of tubes suspended from dual masts indicates the main entrance.Chelazzi, pp. 34-35. Between 1999 and 2005, both the Temperance-Kutner Library and the Webster School were honored for design excellence by multiple chapters of the Society of American Registered Architects. In his personal practice, Dyson continued to develop a grammar of curvilinear and angular forms. Notable arc based forms included the Casey residence (1996) whose one-story lines reflect the crest of a rise overlooking the Pacific Ocean in La Selva Beach, California, and the compact combination of a live-work building in the Hall residence project (1993) for a commercial street corner near the ocean in Cayucos, California, in which vertical curves counterpoint horizontal angular elements in the massing.The Hall project is presented by a rendering found in Chelazzi, p. 57. Three houses are examples of continuity with the grammar of angular composition. The small, economically stringent Peretti residence (1991) in rural Clayton, California, used a deck extension with open cable balustrade outside to increase the sense of interior space. Perched on a ridge overlooking the Straight River, the larger Rietz residence (1991) in Owatonna, Minnesota, reflected a strong client affinity for straight geometric lines.Hammons, p. 98 The Woods residence (1996) in Coarsegold, California, used angular prows of copper sheathed wood reach to reach upward, joining views in the rooms to the horizon through windows, clerestories and skylights. Broader public recognition of Dyson's work increased. The first scholarly exhibition devoted solely to his designs was installed at the Fresno Art Museum in 1994.Poetics of Space: The Architecture of Arthur Dyson, Fresno Art Museum, June 17-August 15, 2004. A similar installation occurred that same year at the gallery of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, an event which coincided with the release of the first monograph discussing Dyson and his work.The Hammons book is cited. For reference to these early exhibitions, see the Dyson web site list of exhibitions: Bruno Zevi continued to present Dyson projects to his European readership, and A+U (Architecture and Urbanism) in Japan once again featured a section on Dyson. Reviews of his work also appeared in Czech and Turkish periodicals. = 2000s = With the turn of the 21st century, Dyson entered an era of expanded opportunities for larger commissions and broadened scope in type of building. This decade was marked by the establishment of new client relationships that produced multiple projects, return of previous clients with additional work, and an increasing number of designs for larger commissions through the DSJ Architects partnership. Dyson also continued his public service activities and outreach efforts to educate both professionals and the general public about the important humanistic values of organic design. As part of this endeavor, he returned to the Taliesin community as Dean of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture from 1999 to 2002. The most spatially expressive and largest house yet completed by Dyson was the Hilton residence (1999/2000) in Paradise by the Sea, Florida. The relationship of the structure to the environment through large glass walls and openings emphasizes the natural rhythmic enjoyment of coastal life, especially sea breezes and beach sunsets. Primary living spaces are suspended as pods within the interior, an arrangement that maximizes ocean sight lines opened through large expanses of glass walls that are tinted to mitigate solar glare.Chelazzi, p. 30-31. The same client also commissioned the Del Coronado Condominiums project (2000), a 24-story, 127 unit beachfront tower in which residents would have completely unobstructed views of the Gulf of Mexico throughout their living space.Chelazzi, 49. Greater opportunities also came to Dyson for work with public and private institutions. Environmental responsiveness and technological sophistication as primary architectural features characterize a series of designs for museums and cultural centers. Having earlier conceived the energy efficient envelope of an earth sheltered museum facility for the Discovery Center project (1999) in Fresno, California,Chelazzi, p. 46. the plans made by Dyson for the science oriented Aquarius Aquarium project (2000), also in Fresno, California, included geothermal heat exchanges for climate control and solar panels to produce hot water.An earlier version of this design with a program description can be found in Chelazzi, pp. 52-53; a newer iteration (2010) can be seen at Public transportation projects included several facilities for a high speed train terminal and monorail stations in Fresno. The DSJ Architects office had continued success in commissions for civic facilities, particularly libraries and schools. The curvilinear form of the Woodward Park Regional Library (2001) in Fresno, California, resulted in the National Award for Excellence for Outstanding Design from the Society of American Registered Architects in 2005 and the design was cited by critics as one of the ten best buildings of the decade in the city, and was cited as one of the ten best buildings of the decade in Fresno. One of the most significant DSJ Architects projects in this period was the University High School, a building located on the campus of California State University, Fresno. The school complex consisted of three interlocked wings containing administrative offices, classroom, and music performance space designed to house the complex requirements of an accelerated college preparatory program for a 9th to 12th grade Liberal Arts education. This building has continued to receive awards from both architectural and educational organizations. = 2010s = In the 2010s, Dyson refined his vocabulary for residential design with the Bishop residence (2012) in St. George, Utah. As the earlier Hilton residence in Florida had taken curvilinear form from the environmental cues of the Gulf of Mexico shore, the Bishop house was inspired by the sloping crest lines of mountains on the horizon and the undulating topography of the building site. Dyson furthered his public service activity with a project designed to assist economically disadvantaged people. The Eco-Village or Eco Pod shelters (2013) were conceived as an optimistic solution to address the struggles of the homeless. Dyson proposed a grouping small, inexpensive personal habitation pods set within a safe, secure, and self-sustaining living environment. Built of recycled and sustainable materials, the individual housing units were centered on a commons containing gardens for growing food, personal hygiene facilities, and an educational space for teaching crafts for self-reliance. One of the most dramatic yet economically constrained forms to come from Dyson through the DSJ Architects practice emerged in the Selma Arts Center (2012/2013) in Selma, California. An infill construction in place of a collapsed store within an existing commercial block, this commission for a theatrical performance space produced a dynamic, extroverted facade that attracted attention to the arts activities. Other significant civic projects for DSJ Architects included a design for a new Fresno County Central Library (2007) and a renovation of the Huron Library (2012) in Huron, California. In 2012, Dyson undertook an unusual project for his office in the restoration of the Randall Fawcett House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1955 and built in Los Banos, California. Completed in 2013, the project repaired a significant roof defect and returned the dwelling to the original appearance. Some intrusive elements that accumulated over time were removed and features planned by Wright not realized in the original construction were introduced. The restoration project gained praise from many quarters, and received awards for excellence from multiple chapters of the American Institute of Architects in 2013-2014.  Design philosophy  The most succinct statement made by Arthur Dyson of the overarching principles that motivate his designs was in an essay he contributed to a book by David Pearson titled ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Breaking Wave‚Äô‚Äô (2001). Dyson is a lifelong proponent of what has been termed organic architecture. This philosophy originated in the life work of architect Louis Henri Sullivan and passed down from his office to inform the work of many other architects. In acknowledging this lineage, Dyson expressed his sense of commitment: :‚ÄúThe philosophy that drives my work is rooted in principles that take the metaphor of the organic world. This architectural approach was first articulated in American by Louis Sullivan. As a young man I apprenticed at various times with later adherents of his organic thesis, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Bruce Goff, and William Gray Purcell. All of these masters used their long careers to emphasize the importance of honesty in architectural expression. They saw this as a spiritual, but not dogmatic, quest that was inherent in every single building.‚ÄùPearson, pp. 208-209 In this essay Dyson defined the key elements of the design process he undertakes. First, there is an examination of the life experiences and aspirations of the client. This assessment examines the motivations, both conscious and unconscious, that brought the client to call for a building. Secondly, there is an intersection of inner discernment with an outer, specific physical location. The given conditions of a building site are predetermined by unavoidable features, such as climate and topography. In the view of Dyson, the resulting form should express individuality of presence that shows this set of conditions. Thirdly, the design must also integrate the availability of economic resources, accessibility of building materials, and responsiveness to legal regulations. The outcome of the design process identifies human life with a given setting, creating a sense of place. In this created place we adopt an identity of belonging that in turn marks our place in the surrounding world. Dyson noted: :‚ÄúIn the rush of the modern world we are ironically often left feeling isolated, yet at the same time weary of demands. This conflict is fundamentally a spiritual one, something that in the mode of organic design has potential architectural solutions. Each of us has a unique and vital contribution to make to the larger human community. In turn, the body politic can only become healthier and stronger for all that participate.‚ÄùPearson, p. 209. In this last statement Dyson reflects a belief that his vocation as an architect is bound inextricably with social activism for a better world.  Dyson Seigrist Janzen Architects [DSJ Architects]  Dyson participates in a separate architectural practice, established in 1991 and now referred to as DSJ Architects, to partner with other architects for collaboration on the production and administrative aspects of larger institutional and commercial commissions, as well custom residential, affordable multi-family housing, governmental, military, medical, retail, financial institutions and offices. Projects produced by DSJ Architects have included numerous award-winning churches, schools, and libraries. The firm presently consists of three principals: Arthur Dyson, who serves as sole designing architect; Robert Seigrist, who oversees contracts, day-to-day operations, and quality control; and Douglas Janzen, AIA, who has special expertise in educational facilities.

often to bring awareness to the work of the architects with whom he apprenticed. In 1992, he provided a preamble to the Guide to Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs California, a book by architectural photographer Scot Zimmerman who has also documented many buildings by Dyson. Dyson once more introduced Wright in Frank Lloyd Wright: The Western Work, with text by Dixie Legler and photography by Scot Zimmerman, in 1999. Dyson wrote a foreword for a book on Bruce Goff created by Goff friend and colleague architect Phil Welch titled Goff on Goff: Conversations and Lectures, and in 1998 presented an introduction to Drawings for an Alternative Architecture: the Folios of John Henry Wythe, an organic architect who had worked in the Goff office. While serving as president of the San Joaquin chapter of the American Institute of Architects in during 1991-1992, Dyson published a series of articles directed to his peers. Each of these short pieces examined different ways of taking a broader view in professional attitude by designing within the larger context of community well being.All the citations for these articles can be found in the Selected Bibliography of Hammons, pp. 106-107 In 2001, Dyson presented a direct statement of his design values and principles that was published in a book on organic architects, alongside illustrations of the Jaksha, Lencioni, Barrett-Tuxford, and Hilton houses.  Selected exhibitions  The work of Arthur Dyson has been exhibited at more than 60 venues, including museums, universities, colleges, academies and schools of architecture, professional associations, national conventions, galleries, and arts centers since the early 1980s. * The American School of Architecture: The Bruce Goff Legacy, Royal Institute of British Architects Museum (May 2 ‚Äì June 8, 1985) * The Architecture of Arthur Dyson, Fresno Art Museum (1993). * Poetics of Space: The Architecture of Arthur Dyson, Fresno Art Museum, (June 17-August 15, 2004) * Arthur Dyson, Architect: The Soul of Architecture (L'Architettura meditativa) Villa Palagione, Centro Interculturale, Volterra, Italy (October 5‚Äì30, 2009)  Honors and awards  Between 1989 and 2014, Arthur Dyson received professional recognition for his architectural designs from more than 23 awarding institutes, councils, competitions, civic programs, and publications.Lists of these honors and other recognitions can be found at and In 1993, Dyson was awarded the Gold Medal of the Society of American Registered Architects (SARA), a national American architectural organization that also has various regional chapters. In addition to the Gold Medal, the Dyson practice received the Distinguished Presidential Citation (1994) and the Presidential Citation for Dedication and Contribution to the Professional of Architecture (1992). SARA has given the National Honor Awards for Design Excellence or the National Honor Award for Outstanding Design to 18 projects from the Dyson and DSJ Architects offices. In addition, the individual chapters of SARA have presented other recognitions, including State Firm Award (1998, 2004) from the California Council, together with 31 further honors for individual projects; the Outstanding Firm Award (2002) and Medal of Honor for Lifetime Achievement in Architecture (2000) from the New York Council, along with 18 individual project honors; and 6 additional project awards from the Pennsylvania and Illinois Councils of SARA (1994-2008). As a longstanding member of his regional San Joaquin Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), Dyson was most recently presented by this group with the Lifetime Achievement Award (2014). His work had previously been recognized with the Presidential Award (2006), Architectural Firm of the Millennium (1999), and Presidential Citation for Lifetime Contribution to the Profession (1999). Between 1993 and 2012, Dyson's practice and DSJ Architects partnership received 30 honors from the San Joaquin Chapter for design excellence in individual projects. Other AIA chapters have also offered similar awards. In 2003, Dyson was presented with an International Honorary Diploma as Professor of Architecture at the International Academy of Architecture, Sofia, Bulgaria.

He wakes the brother next to him and tries to tell him about the story, but he doesn't care. Mammy notices the light coming from the children's room so goes in and, seeing what her son is doing, grabs the book and throws it out the window. Then, she tells the three of them about the fox who eats birds and who surely, if they try to go outside early to catch a worm, will catch them. The youngsters prepare again to go to sleep; the book-reader tells the other two that he will get up early in the morning and go catch the worm. At five a.m., he sneaks out and begins sniffing out a worm. Meanwhile, a worm has come across the discarded book and reads about the \\"early bird\\"; he decides to sniff one out. In this manner, they find each other and, frightened, each run away. Once the bird realizes he has met the worm, he chases after him. After a few gags Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd style, the fox appears and holds up two signs for the audience. One says \\"The Villain\\" and the other \\"As if you didn't know\\". The fox then chases the bird as the bird is chasing the worm. Noticing the fox but not realizing it is indeed this dangerous animal, the bird stops and engages in conversation, actually believing that this creature is also an \\"early bird\\" after the worm. He shares his mammy's descriptive warning about the fox, slowly coming to realize that he is face to face with one. The young bird is captured but, as the fox is fixing him up as a sandwich, the worm - with the assistance of an angry bee - rescues him. The bird goes home and gets back into bed with his siblings just as the alarm clock rings and Mammy comes in. She asks her three children what they want for breakfast. The other two say worms, but the \\"early bird\\" says he does not want worms. The worm pops up from beneath the sheets and says he doesn't, either, then covers his mouth, followed by the iris out. Reception Motion Picture Exhibitor (Jan 24, 1940): \\"The little bird doesn't believe the story, wants to find out for himself, is caught by the bad fox, and then saved by the little worm, all of which is familiar, but made in the better Schlesinger vein.

Personal life David ben Shimon was the son of a wealthy merchant in Morocco. He married Rachel, the daughter of Rabbi Masoud Tsabbach, and one of their children was Rabbi Rafael Aharon. A talented leader and a distinguished scholar, Ben Shimon attracted a large following at an early age. In 1854, at the age of twenty eight, he moved to Jerusalem together with several of his disciples, and he quickly became a leading figure within the Moroccan Jewish community.Greer Fay Cashman: Restored beyond former glory Jerusalem Post 06/09/2011.Rabbi Yosef Leichter: A Moroccan Lover of Zion Zomet, Volume 1408: Va'era 26th of Tevet 5772/21 January 2012. In Jerusalem, his learning, his wisdom and his charisma attracted increasing numbers of followers. He established the Tzuf Dvash Synagogue in 1860, and participated in the establishment of Mishkenot Shaananim. Relations with the Sephardi community, which ruled Jerusalem, became strained, as he felt they tried to master him. He decided to establish a community of his own, \\"Edah HaMaaravit B'Yerushalayim\\". Together with his followers, he settled in 1867 on a lot he had purchased outside the walls of the Old City, Mahane Israel. Two synagogues, several Batei Medrash (houses of study), and other institutions were built there. His Moroccan followers were soon followed by Jews from other North African countries, who wished to break away from the Sephardi yoke. The community was the first to break off from the direct supervision of the Sephardic umbrella organization \\"Ha'Edah HaSfaradit B'Yerushalayim\\".Barak Sarig Rabbi David ben Shimon ‚Äì The 'Tzuf Devash' Tog News 11/12/2009. He sent meshulachs (fundraisers for charity in the Holy land) to Jewish communities in Islamic countries, and used the money to aid the needy, as well as to build the institutions of his community. He opened a meat store where he would distribute meat to the poor, and he took care of widows and orphans. He reported all donations and expenses in a newsletter called Havatzelet. Ben Shimon served as Rosh Yeshiva, rabbi and posek, and gave halachic rulings in his Beth Din. His reputation drew crowds from outside his community to hear him and study with him. The first six years, he was the leader at large for his community; thereafter he appointed a committee of seven rabbis who would assist him in leading the community. Sir Moses Montefiore also greatly assisted the community. Books Ben Shimon planned a series of books about the Holy Land by the name of Shaarei Tzedek. In 1862 he published the first volume, Shaar Hachatzer a collection of commentaries of the Sages regarding the Holy Land, supplemented with his own commentaries. The second volume was published posthumously: Shaar Hamatarah on the laws of the land. The third book, Shaar Hakadim, with introductions about matters pertaining to Eretz Yisrael, was never printed. Shaar Hamifkad on the special traditions of the land was edited by the author's son Rabbi Rafael Aharon and was published in Egypt in 1908. Shaar Takdim is about the commandments of the land and Shaarei Tehilah contains prayers and songs for special occasions. Rabbi David's responsa were included in a book by his son named Umitzur Devash. The divorce cases in which Rabbi David was involved are summarized in the book Shem Chadash, by his youngest son Rabbi Masoud.

Bro-country songs are often about attractive young women, the consumption of alcohol, partying, and pickup trucks. The first use of the term was by Jody Rosen of New York magazine in an article published on August 11, 2013, in which Rosen described songs by Florida Georgia Line, particularly their debut single \\"Cruise\\". Rosen also named Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, and Jake Owen among singers of the genre. Entertainment Weekly cited \\"Boys 'Round Here\\" by Blake Shelton and \\"Ready Set Roll\\" by Chase Rice as other examples of bro- country. The popularity of the genre opened up a divide between the older generation of country singers and the bro-country singers which was described as \\"civil war\\" by musicians, critics and journalists. Popularity Florida Georgia Line whose hit song \\"Cruise\\" drew attention to the subgenre Although elements of bro-country had been noted prior, such as in the Trace Adkins hit \\"Honky Tonk Badonkadonk\\", the genre began to gather steam in the early 2010s, but the song that brought the movement to the attention of music journalists was the 2012 Florida Georgia Line song \\"Cruise\\". In 2014, \\"Cruise\\" became the best-selling digital country song of all time, with over 7 million copies sold in the US while also holding a then-record 24 weeks as the No. 1 Hot Country Song. According to Jody Rosen: \\"We may look back on 'Cruise' as a turning point, the moment when the balance of power tipped from an older generation of male country stars to the bros.\\". A number of highly popular albums and songs by singers such as Jason Aldean, Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton considered to be bro-country appeared in the first half of the 2010s. In 2013, Luke Bryan's Crash My Party was the third best-selling of all albums in the US, with Florida Georgia Line's Here's to the Good Times at sixth and Blake Shelton's Based on a True Story at ninth. It has also been estimated in research in mid-2010s that about 45 percent of country‚Äôs best-selling songs could be considered bro-country, with the top two artists being Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line. While bro-country was popular with country music fans, programmers and those within the industry grew weary of the genre. According to radio programmer R.J. Curtis: \\"The real fatigue on it has been with [radio] programmers and the people who have to listen to it a lot and evaluate it ‚Äî the air personalities and the program directors. The people who aren't really sick of it are the listeners.\\" Some thought that the genre had waned by 2015; others, however, felt that the genre remained popular and argued that it had expanded in a positive way. According to radio program director Phathead: \\"The hip-hop, rock and R&B; influence you hear in Sam Hunt, Thomas Rhett, Brett Eldredge, Cole Swindell and all the others is about to take us to new places, and it's awesome.\\" Criticism The bro-country movement has been criticized by listeners and music reviewers for its repetitive subject matter, namely lyrical themes of partying associated with Friday nights, alcoholic beverages, and trucks, as well as its lack of female country artists. Traditional country fans and artists have expressed the sentiment that bro-country music is a poor representation of country music. One critic who spoke favorably about bro- country was David Horsey of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote: \\"But this music has an appeal not unlike the teen surfing songs of the Beach Boys or the screaming guitar, take-everything-too-far anthems of Bon Jovi and Sammy Hagar...For a young man, the allure of reckless freedom is forever strong. And it‚Äôs not just young men. I know I‚Äôve got a 25-year-old bottled up inside my decidedly not young self who still longs for the fantasy.\\" The genre was also criticized for being formulaic. Throughout 2014, radio station KTCK (AM) had a regular segment called \\"Fun With Country Music\\" hosted by Corby Davidson, criticizing the new form of country music, and produced a checklist of specific items that would be found in these songs: boots, alcohol, jeans, trucks, guns, farm equipment, the word \\"girl\\", and rural settings. A video by Greg Todd, an aspiring songwriter, which highlighted the similarities between bro-country songs went viral after being featured by Time in January 2015. The video combined six songs released between 2012 and 2014: Shelton's \\"Sure Be Cool If You Did\\", Bryan's \\"Drunk on You\\", Florida Georgia Line's \\"This Is How We Roll\\", Cole Swindell's \\"Chillin' It\\", Parmalee's \\"Close Your Eyes\\" and Chase Rice's \\"Ready Set Roll\\". Todd noted the formula as \\"a tight, mid-tempo backbeat; a quick, two-verse set-up, often laced with clever wordplay and bouncy, lyrical melody; and ‚Äî bam ‚Äî the power chorus to bring it all home and keep them coming back.\\" In addition, some also criticized the music's portrayal of women. In November 2014, country artist Kenny Chesney, interviewed by Billboard, opined about bro-country: \\"over the last several years, it seems like anytime anybody sings about a woman, she‚Äôs in cutoff jeans, drinking and on a tailgate... they objectify the hell out of them.\\" In December 2014, Brad Paisley spoke out against bro-country and the lack of females on country radio: \\"one of my frustrations with radio now is lyrics: [...] there's a lot of stuff on the radio about, you know, put your tan legs on the dashboard and we'll roll around in the truck and go party. It's like, 'Guys, come on!' ‚Äì and specifically, yes, guys, 'cause there are no girls! We can say something, too. There are phrases that are totally clich√© that we as songwriters owe it to ourselves to not use again.\\" In 2017, Steve Earle noted that the genre was, in some ways, a watered-down form of hip hop, stating that \\"The guys just wanna sing about getting fucked up. They‚Äôre just doing hip-hop for people who are afraid of black people. I like the new Kendrick Lamar record, so I‚Äôll just listen to that.‚Äù =Response= In response to the criticisms, Blake Shelton said in January 2013 that he did not care about the \\"old farts\\" who complained about their songs: \\"Well that's because you don't buy records anymore, jackass. The kids do, and they don't want to buy the music you were buying.\\" In turn, that sparked a response from Ray Price via his Facebook page: \\"It's a shame that I have spend 63 years in this business trying to introduce music to a larger audience and to make it easier for the younger artists who are coming behind me. ... You should be so lucky as us old-timers. Check back in 63 years (the year 2075) and let us know how your music will be remembered.\\" Shelton later apologized to Ray Price. Zac Brown described Luke Bryan‚Äôs \\"That's My Kind of Night\\" as the worst song he had ever heard, to which Jason Aldean replied, \\"nobody gives a shit what u think.\\" Aldean also called the term bro-country ridiculous and was bothered to be labeled as such because he did not \\"feel like it's a compliment,\\" that \\"it's sort of a backhanded thing that comes from a very narrow-minded listener\\". On his song about drinking and trucks, he said: \\"Yeah, we've had some songs that talk about that stuff. But that's also what we really grew up doing. A lot of us grew up in these little towns where there wasn't a whole lot to do, and we were entertaining ourselves. I can't sing you a song about being a stockbroker on Wall Street, because I don't even know where the hell Wall Street's at.\\" Rosen himself was unhappy the way the term bro-country had been used by some as an insult and felt that some criticisms of the genre came from class and regional prejudices and snobbery. He thought that artists such as Jake Owen and Thomas Rhett made music that pushed the genre into \\"exciting new territory\\" and said: \\"All the ways country is flirting with R&B; and hip hop, production-wise and otherwise, I think it‚Äôs really cool.\\" To Rosen, bro- country has changed country in a positive way, producing an increasing diversity of sound and subject matter on country radio. Reactions in music A number of country singers expressed their criticism of the genre in their songs. In July 2014, female duo Maddie & Tae released their debut single, \\"Girl in a Country Song\\", which criticized and referenced many bro-country songs, particularly the roles of females within such songs. However, in the same month, country singer songwriter Maggie Rose released her single \\"Girl in Your Truck Song\\". In the song she praises bro-country songs, saying she actually wants to be the girl in their songs. In August 2014, country artist Brad Paisley recorded a song called \\"4WP\\" for his album Moonshine in the Trunk. In the song, Paisley pokes fun at bro-country by joining the trend and heavily relying on some of its recurrent elements. A sample of Paisley's hit single \\"Mud on the Tires\\" is also featured in the song. About the song, Paisley said: \\"In the middle of this bro-country movement, with all this criticism about [the genre's reliance on] the jean shorts and the mud and the outdoors, we do a song that's just like that... but we include a sample of myself from 2003! Which is kind of like saying, 'I have a little license. I kinda did this already'. But it's written so tongue-in-cheek, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.\\" On October 15, 2014, Canadian country music artist Paul Brandt released the song \\"Get a Bed\\" as a comedic response to the bro- country phenomenon. In April 2015, songwriter Brent Cobb, who has written cuts by Miranda Lambert, Little Big Town, Frankie Ballard and Luke Bryan, released a song called \\"Yo Bro\\" which mocks and pokes fun at all of bro-country's clich√©s stating that it was \\"inspired by frustration\\".

It had a fleet of Vickers Viscount aircraft, operating between one and three at any given time and a total of five aircraft. Based in Malm√∂, it initially flew out of Malm√∂ Bulltofta Airport. The airport closed in 1972 and Skyline moved to Malm√∂ Sturup Airport. From 1975 to 1977 the company experienced a major increase to traffic flying three aircraft for Linjeflyg for its scheduled, domestic network. Flying out of Stockholm Bromma Airport, it served seven towns in southern Sweden. On 15 January 1977 one its aircraft flying Linjeflyg Flight 618 crashed at K√§lvesta during approach to Bromma, killing all 22 people on board. The Linjeflyg contract expired that year and the company ceased operations in 1978. History Skyline was established in 1971 with a base at Malm√∂ Bulltofta Airport. It originally operated a Vickers 784 Viscount with a capacity for 65 passengers. It relied on various charter services, such as student clubs and sports clubs for revenue. Skyline moved from Bulltofta to the Malm√∂ Sturup Airport on 2 December 1972, when the former was closed and replaced by the latter. A Vickers Viscount in 1972 Because of delays of the delivery of their new Fokker F28 Fellowship aircraft, Linjefly started in 1975 to wet lease flights from Skyline. Initially these consisted of the routes Stockholm‚ÄìKalmar‚ÄìRonneby, Stockholm‚ÄìVisby, Stockholm‚ÄìVisby‚ÄìKalmar‚ÄìRonneby‚ÄìMalm√∂, Stockholm‚ÄìHultsfred‚ÄìV√§xj√∂‚ÄìKristianstad‚ÄìMalm√∂.To deal with the traffic, Skyline leased two additional Viscounts, the larger 814D model with capacity for 75 passengers. These had originally been delivered to Lufthansa. Skyline operated with their own crew and aircraft, but with Linjeflyg's flight codes and chartered for an hourly fee. During the late 1970s Linjeflyg accounted for the vast majority of Skyline's revenue, although it continued to supplement with conventional charter flights. The airline replaced its first aircraft with a similar, larger Vickers 838 Viscount. That year Skyline started two additional routes for Linjeflyg: Stockholm‚ÄìJ√∂nk√∂ping and Stockholm‚ÄìKarlstad. However, the aircraft would be written off in Flight 618 on 15 January 1977 and was therefore replaced with a leased Viscont 814D. This arrangement lasted for some months, before Skyline's contract with Linjeflyg was terminated due to the delivery of the F28s. Skyline ceased operations in 1978.

The flight was operated from Malm√∂ to Stockholm via Kristianstand, V√§xj√∂ and J√∂nk√∂ping. During approach to Stockholm Bromma Airport the horizontal stabilizer experienced atmospheric icing. Low power on two of the engines had caused reduced function of the ice protection system, causing a buildup of ice. During approach the pilots suddenly lost pitch control and the aircraft crashed in the neighborhood of K√§lvesta, Stockholm.

Description Colchicum ritchii grows from a corm which is oval measuring 2-3.5 cm across, and covered with a loose brown skin. The leaves, which emerge and develop at the same time as the flowers, are largely hairless and elongate after flowering to form a cone which protects the developing fruits. The flowers which appear in December, January and February are white or pink, with plants with either colour frequently growing alongside each other. Each plant produces 2-10 flowers, which each have 6 tepals, 6 anthers and 3 styles. The inner tepals are ridged with just one, or at most very few teeth at the base, near the base of the anther. The anthers are black, but get covered by yellow pollen. The fruit is a green, irregularly shaped capsule, up to 35 mm long and 15 mm across which contains round, globular seeds. Habitat Colchicum ritchii is a plant of sand and loess soils in desert and shrub-steppes . Distribution Colchicum ritchii is found from Tunisia in the west to Jordan and Saudi Arabia.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, Colchicum ritchiiRobert Brown. 1826. Narrative of Travels and Discoveries in Northern and Central Africa App.: 241, Colchicum ritchii Uses Extracts from Colchicum ritchii are used in traditional medicine to treat arthritis, rheumatism, gout and abdominal colics. Bedouin children dig up the corms from the desert to sell them after drying them to herbalists in Alexandria and other Egyptian cities.

He soon moved into more subjective photography and in colour. He was aware of the colour photography of Paul Graham and Martin Parr, Charlie Meecham and Bob Phillips, but it was seeing the work of North American colour photographers William Eggleston, Joel Sternfeld, Stephen Shore and Joel Meyerowitz that convinced him to change to colour for his own work and put him into an influential group of British colour documentarists including Graham and Anna Fox. He changed to a larger format camera, which allowed smaller details to be easily read and understood, not requiring the bold graphic statements he considered necessary with 35 mm; and to using a flashgun. As influences and inspirations, Reas has also cited David Byrne and Talking Heads, and northern soul. In 1985 he and Ron McCormick were the first photographers commissioned by Ffotogallery in Wales as part of its Valleys Project to each produce a body of work which \\"focussed on the changing topographic landscape and the partial introduction of new technology into a latter day industrial wasteland\\". Other photographers commissioned were David Bailey, Mike Berry, John Davies, Peter Fraser, Francesca Odell, Roger Tiley and William Tsui.A resource on the Valleys Project is available here (PDF) within Ffotogallery's website. Reas's first book, I Can Help, shows supermarkets, superstores and the like, photographed from 1985 to 1988. Val Williams writes that \\"The people who Reas photographed emerged from its pages . . . as lost souls, modern Ancient Mariners adrift in an ocean of endless choices.\\" The photographs (1989‚Äì1993) in his second book, Flogging a Dead Horse, \\"explored the rise of the heritage business, taking issue with what he judged to be the cynical re-writing of the past of British working people by the leisure industry\\"; they are \\"edgy, viciously satirical comments on our appetite for vicarious experience.\\" Reas worked commercially as an editorial photographer for The Sunday Times Magazine, The Observer and the BBC. For a period he worked as an advertising photographer for clients such as BT and Volkswagen. He taught at the Faculty of Arts, University of Brighton, from 1993 to 1998. He is course leader of documentary photography at the University of Wales, Newport. In 2011/2012 Reas completed From a Distance, a year-long commission on the regeneration of the Elephant and Castle in South London, part of The Elephant Vanishes project, directed by Patrick Sutherland, for London College of Communication. He photographed people candidly, showing fraught and tense emotions (with the aid of an assistant with a boom mounted flashgun); portraits; cans of incense intended to provide help under specific social pressures; and discarded furniture. The photographs were exhibited in 2012 and published by Photography and the Archive Research Centre (PARC) in Fieldstudy 16: From a Distance.Fieldstudy 16 is available here (PDF) within the UAL Research Online website. Reas has said of his work that \\"I would say I photograph people but I think the pictures are more about systems people find themselves in, people shopping in supermarkets, but it‚Äôs about consumerism and how we are caught up in that. I never set anything up. Everything I photograph is as it happens\\". As well as consumerism, Reas has also been concerned with politics, Americanisation, the heritage industry, gender politics and how northern working-class people are historically represented. His work is usually biographical. In 1993, Reas began a series, Portrait of an Invisible Man, that examined the mystery of his distant and mostly absent father \\"by photographing the microcosm which a child observes in the macrocosm of home\\". The curators of an exhibition at the Barbican wrote of this series: \\"Paul Reas's meticulously constructed descriptions of domestic life may perhaps exorcise demons, the ghouls and goblins which inhabit a child's imagination; they are photography as remedy, as exhumation and a personal adventure on a grand scale.\\" Williams writes that Reas's work of the early 1990s \\"assume a documentary stance, but they are essentially polemical.\\" Robert Clark writes in The Guardian: > Reas has an eye for themes that reveal a prevailing air of social > disillusionment and cultural vacuity. As traditional industry disappears, we > see the emergence of assembly-line technologies. The architectural identity > of towns dissolve to make way for out-of-town shopping malls. Heritage- > industry theme parks indulge in a politically dubious nostalgia as the > London property boom explodes. On the face of it it‚Äôs unrelentingly grim. > Yet Reas populates such scenes with real characters, replete with poker- > faced humour and shrugging defiance.\\" Publications =Publications by Reas= * I Can Help.

He attended Southern Illinois University in 2000, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts. Career Two Feathers' work has been added to the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and the 21C Museum. He also has held solo exhibitions and has pieces in the collections of the Wellin Museum of Art in Clinton, New Jersey, and the Nevada Museum of Art. His art has been reviewed in Art in America, The Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times He displays his work regularly at the Morgan Lehman Gallery in New York City.

Selected Works  = Isabel, Queen of Harlem = Isabel, Queen of Harlem was made in 2017 using coffee and tea stained paper mounted onto a 30 x 22 inch canvas and ink. Frohawk Two Feathers uses his artistic ability to bring together 18th and 19th century colonial portraiture and contemporary urban culture. This piece was part of the Messier Objects, You Get the Gods You Deserve Part 3 of The Americas 1795 art exhibit. The oval frame made of coffee and tea surrounding Isabel makes her the focus of the piece. The thin lines of ink that make up Isabel, from a distance, appear as though they were just light brush strokes, but up close it is as though the individual lines piece her together. The line running down her headdress guides you down her face and down the shirt she is wearing. The piece is monochromatic and instead uses closer together lines to indicate shadows and farther apart lines to indicate lighter regions. He creates texture much the same way. The coat has curved, spaced apart lines that give the appearance of animal fur. It has a flat surface and the texture of this piece is implied.

John Prophet was a clothier in Hereford. Circa 1377 he was one of twenty-five citizens appointed by Richard II as Custodians of the city with full powers as Commissioners of Array to marshall the town's defences. From 1385 onwards he was regularly employed to witness deeds. He was entitled to amortize messuages by royal licence to sponsor a chapel chantry for the Holy Rood in All Saints Church in the centre of the city to pray for the souls of their ancestors. What is confusing is that the King's Secretary was also Master John Prophet, Dean of Hereford, so that on his appointment there arose a conflict of interest with the civic offices of the town's alnagers. This may explain the dean's mugging in church lane, and possibly Master Prophet's decision to seek preferment elsewhere. Permission had to be obtained both from the king and the bishop, which was not completed until June 1391. It seems that in 1391 he travelled to the west midlands with seven other deputies on behalf of the chief alnager of England, William Hervy, and was holding the office of an alnager when returned a burgess Member of the Parliament of England for Hereford in 1391.

It is a Japanese American-led organization, fully dedicated to strengthening ties between the United States and Japan in a global context. History USJC was founded in 2009 by Japanese Americans who \\"saw a need for a conscious effort to ensure a strong relationship with Japan.\\" Central to such an effort was Irene Hirano Inouye, then president and CEO of the Japanese American National Museum, who had been working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to introduce Japanese American leaders to Japan through the Japanese American Leadership Delegation. Hirano Inouye is now the President of USJC. In 2012, the U.S.-Japan Council (Japan) was created to support the administration of the TOMODACHI Initiative. In 2013, U.S.-Japan Council (Japan) became a Public Interest Corporation (Koeki Zaidan Hojin). President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe praised the work of the U.S.-Japan Council in supporting the U.S.-Japan relationship in a Joint Statement issued during their April 2014 Summit. The Joint Statement particularly highlighted the importance of the Japan American Leadership Delegation and the TOMODACHI Initiative, two of the U.S.-Japan Council's signature programs. Organization USJC cultivates an international network of Japanese American leaders known as Council Members, and collaborates with other organizations and institutions to develop programs that allow Council Members to engage with their Japanese counterparts and leaders in the United States. The organization since 2016, is chaired by Cisco chairman Chuck Robbins. Programs USJC has several programs, including the USJC Annual Conference, the Japanese American Leadership Delegation program, the Consuls General & Japanese American Leaders Meeting, the TOMODACHI Emerging Leaders Program, and Legislative and Business Networking Initiatives. The Tomodachi Initiative The Tomodachi Initiative is a public‚Äìprivate partnership between the U.S.-Japan Council and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Born out of support for Japan‚Äôs recovery from the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011, Tomodachi invests in the next generation of Japanese and American leaders through educational and cultural exchanges as well as leadership programs. In the aftermath of the Great Tohoku earthquake, USJC created the U.S.-Japan Council Earthquake Relief Fund, which supported the relief and recovery efforts of several NPOs and NGOs in Japan. Ambassador John V. Roos, who was serving in Japan at the time, approached USJC to work with the embassy to implement a public-private partnership. This then became the Tomodachi Initiative.

Kill! is a 2006 horror film written and directed by Chad Ferrin.  Plot  The night before Easter, a lowlife named Remington dons an Easter Bunny mask, and robs a convenience store with a shotgun, shooting the clerk in the mouth. Remington is then revealed to have charmed his way into the life of widow Mindy Peters, a nurse who lives with her cerebral palsy- afflicted son Nicholas, who Remington torments when Mindy is not around. While taking out the garbage, Nicholas befriends a disfigured vagrant who gives him a rabbit he claims is an Easter Bunny. Nicholas decides to keep the rabbit a secret, but it is discovered by Remington, who threatens to kill it if Nicholas says anything bad about him to Mindy. On Easter, Mindy has to work a double shift, so she leaves Nicholas alone with Remington, after the latter kicks out some unscrupulous home renovators. As soon as Mindy leaves, Remington assaults Nicholas, and calls over a physically disabled and pedophilic acquaintance named Ray, who he \\"rents\\" Nicholas to in exchange for money and drugs. Remington goes to get prostitutes, and while Ray searches for Nicholas, someone wearing Remington's discarded Easter Bunny mask murders him with a knife, and a drill. As the killer disposes of Ray's body, the renovators return to pick up their tools, and ransack the house. The killer disembowels one with a circular saw, and wounds another with a hammer as the remaining one is approached by the vagrant. Remington arrives with a pair of prostitutes named Candy and Brooke, and they are attacked by the injured and disoriented handyman (who Remington kills with a flashlight) and the killer. Candy is impaled through the mouth with a broomstick handle, Brooke is stabbed with a piece of glass, and Remington has his throat slit. The killer is shown to be Mindy, who taunts Remington as he dies, stating, \\"I hid, and watched, and I saw how you treated Nicholas. I heard every venomous word that spewed through your deceitful mouth. Until I ended it. Just like his father\\". A flashback then shows that exactly a decade prior, Mindy set Donald, her abusive husband, on fire because he regarded Nicholas as a burdensome freak. The homeless man enters, and is revealed to be Donald, who asks for forgiveness, and acceptance back into the family, unveiling to Mindy and Nicholas the head of a renovator he had murdered to help Mindy. The three embrace, and the film ends with Donald saying, \\"Now, what do you say we clean up these dead bodies, and start a family, huh?\\"  Cast  * Timothy Muskatell as Remington Rashkor * Ricardo Gray as Nicholas Peters ** Max Haaga as Young Nicholas Peters * Charlotte Marie as Mindy Peters * David Z.

Kill! is a pretty shallow exercise, but Ferrin seems to know that and doesn't masquerade the film as anything other than what it actually is ‚Äì a fun, pretense-free throwback to a bygone era of exploitation cinema. It's this sense of play that slightly elevates the film above Ferrin's Someone's Knocking at the Door, a movie I felt tried too hard to be about something when it would've worked better by simply following through on its gonzo premise. There's no such attempt at message-making in EBKK; it's sheer camp, a tongue- in-cheek nightmare of blood-splattered psychedelia and over-the-top (albeit clumsily edited) kills\\". Steve Barton of Dread Central gave the film a score of 3¬Ω out of 5, called it well acted and competently made, and stated, \\"My advice? If you see it playing at a festival somewhere and you have the stomach for it, do not miss it. Easter Bunny, Kill! Kill! revels in its obscenity and packs enough punch to knock out even the most jaded of viewers\\". DVD Talk's Jeremy Biltz bestowed a grade of 2¬Ω out of 5, and gave his final thoughts as, \\"Easter Bunny Kill Kill is pure, bottled weirdness. It's creepy, tense, gory and fun. It also has some significant flaws in the acting, story and pacing. It's no cinematic masterpiece, but there is a body of considerable talent lurking beneath the surface that pokes its head up from time to time. Rent this one\\".

The story takes place in Japan, and follows Karasuno High School's boys volleyball team on their journey to restore their school's reputation and to qualify for Nationals. Main characters: =Karasuno High School:= is located in Miyagi prefecture, T≈çhoku region. The karasu part of the school name \\"Karasuno\\" means 'crow'. Karasuno is nicknamed the \\"Flightless Crows\\" and the \\"Fallen Champs\\", since they were formerly a powerhouse team that recently fell from grace, tarnishing their reputation as a result; they are also called \\"Country Bumpkin Crows\\" by Kuroo, since they live in a relatively rural area. According to Oikawa, Karasuno doesn't have a particular play style, and instead opts to be open and try out new play styles. Karasuno has a famous rivalry with Nekoma High School, located in Tokyo, which is dubbed the \\"Battle at the Trash Heap\\" because crows and cats (Nekoma's mascot) are animals known to rummage through garbage. Within its own prefecture, its main rivals are Aoba Johsai High School, Date Tech High School, and Shiratorizawa Academy. Karasuno's banner is all black with the sole word \\"fly\\" in white. Its team colors are black and orange. ;, #10 : :Played by: Kenta Suga (2015‚Äì2018), Kotaro Daigo (2019‚Äìpresent) :Hinata is a first-year student at Karasuno High School and the protagonist. He was initially a wing spiker in Junior High but is currently a middle blocker. He is coincidentally the number 10, which the Little Giant, the former Karsuno ace and his idol, also wore. His speed and incredible vertical jump allow him to play as a decoy to trick opposing teams and grant leeway to Karasuno's attackers, gaining him the nickname \\"the perfect decoy\\". Though he aspires to become the ace, he grows to learn and embrace the importance of his role. Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. Despite his small size, clumsiness, and lack of fundamental skills, his extraordinary stamina, reflexes, and vertical earn him a spot on the regular lineup. He plays exceptionally well when partnered with Kageyama as his setter, and the two quickly gaining notoriety amongst other teams for their 'freak quick', where Hinata jumps before (as opposed to during or after) the toss, then Kageyama quickly and accurately sets the ball to the exact pinnacle of Hinata's jump. Hinata is incredibly devoted to volleyball and practices tirelessly, leading to his explosive growth as a player. ;, #9 : :Played by: Tatsunari Kimura (2015‚Äì2017), Tatsuya Kageyama (2017‚Äì2018), Ryunosuke Akana (2019‚Äìpresent) :Kageyama is a first-year student at Karasuno High School. He is the team's starting setter and was notoriously known as the \\"King of the Court\\" in Junior High for his tyrannical sets and authoritarian-style leadership and he likes hinata way more than volleyball. Considered one of Karasuno's two prodigy players, his tenacious desire to win coupled with his lack of regard for needs of his teammates caused them to abandon him in the middle of a match. Kageyama becomes deeply afraid of Karasuno abandoning him in a similar way and strives to be more considerate of the needs of his team. He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was rejected. At Karasuno, Kageyama slowly learns the importance of trust, respect, and teamwork in volleyball. He forms an unlikely setter-spiker partnership with Hinata, and the two develop their signature freak quick. Known even amongst other schools as a 'volleyball genius', Kageyama is famous for his 'pin-point' setting accuracy, serves, and game sense. Because it is his responsibility as a setter to 'utilize' each spiker to their greatest potential, he functions as one of Karasuno's main pillars of attack. Though he is usually polite with good intentions, he nevertheless has poor social skills and difficulty expressing himself. He often engages in trivial competitions and shouting matches with Hinata. ;, #11 : :Played by: Ryotaro Kosaka (2015‚Äì2018), Ryosuke Yamamoto (2019‚Äìpresent) :Tsukishima is a salty first-year student at Karasuno High School and a middle blocker. He is Karasuno's tallest player and known for being a calm and clever blocker, forming an important part of Karasuno's defense. His simultaneously polite yet condescending attitude often angers both his own teammates (usually Kageyama and Hinata) and opposing teams. Tsukishima often thanks other players cheerfully when they make snide remarks to his face. Despite his apparent arrogance and scornful attitude, Tsukishima actually has an inferiority complex and hates \\"elite players\\" like Kageyama; during the team's formation, he only refers to Kageyama as 'the King' or 'Your Highness' to anger him and draw out his tyrannical personality. Tsukishima is the only team member to question his devotion to volleyball, due in part to past personal experiences. His closest friend is Yamaguchi, who refers to him by the nickname \\"Tsukki\\". Despite his apparent indifference towards him, Tsukishima trusts in his abilities and is proud of his improvements. As a player, he is noted to be the complete opposite of Hinata, who in contrast is short, energetic, and acts instinctually. ;, #12 : :Played by: Kairi Miura (2015‚Äì2018), Yoshinari Oribe (2019‚Äìpresent) :Yamaguchi is a tsukki lover first-year student at Karasuno High School and a middle blocker. Yamaguchi is utilized as \\"Karasuno's spear\\" and pinch-server, often catching opponents off guard and scoring consecutive points in a row. He is shy but friendly and extremely hard-working. After realizing his lack of skill prevented him from contributing to the team in a productive way, he sought the help of Karasuno alumnus Makoto Shimada, who teaches him how to jump float serve. He is close friends with Tsukishima, who he has followed around since the third grade when the latter scared off a group of boys who bullied him for his freckles. A running gag in the series is Yamaguchi complimenting Tsukishima, Tsukishima telling him to shut up, and Yamaguchi apologizing. Despite his admiration for his friend, Yamaguchi is not afraid to voice his opinion when he disapproves of something Tsukishima is doing, and yells at him for not giving his all during training. ;, #1 : :Played by: Keita Tanaka (2015, 2018), Kentaro Akisawa (2016‚Äì2017), Sho Higano (2019‚Äìpresent) :Deadchi is the captain of Karasuno and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. He is a wing spiker and a very dependable receiver, functioning as one of the team's defensive pillars. A resilient and kind leader, he is strong-willed and encourages the team both on and off the court. As the captain, Daichi has a scary side as well; a running gag in the series is when players (often Nishinoya and Tanaka) settle down because someone mentions that \\"Daichi is coming\\". He is closest with Sugawara and Asahi, having joined the team with them in his first year. He usually prefers to let his teammates work out their issues themselves rather than step in as the captain in order to encourage their personal growth. ;, #2 : :Played by: Hiroki Ino (2015‚Äì2017), Naoki Tanaka (2018), Ryu Ichinose (2019‚Äìpresent) :Sugamama, often nicknamed Suga, is the vice-captain of the volleyball club and a third-year mommy at Karasuno High School. He is originally the team's starting setter but is replaced by Kageyama. In spite of this, Sugawara holds no hard feelings and remains supportive towards both him and the rest of the team, determined to play as much as he can in his final year of high school. He is cheerful, nurturing, and empathetic; so much so, that he is nicknamed \\"Mr. Pleasant\\" by Oikawa. Despite this, Sugawara is known to be \\"scary when he's mad\\", and can become hostile when irritated. Highly intelligent and perceptive, he is deeply considerate of the moods and needs of his teammates when on the court; Coach Ukai notes that he has \\"the full trust of his teammates\\". When subbed on, he forms the basis of the team's synchronized attack and is able to utilize Kageyama as an additional spiker. He is also a pinch-server and able to aim his serves accurately to specific places on the court. He is close friends with Daichi and Asahi, having joined in his first year with them. ;, #3 : :Played by: Justin Tomimori (2015‚Äì2018), Yuya Fukuda (2019‚Äìpresent) :Asahi is a third-year student at Karasuno and a wing spiker. The physically strongest player on the team, he is considered the current ace of Karasuno and is a pillar of attack for the team. His long hair, large stature, and impressive strength make him intimidating to others at first; much to his chagrin, players from other schools even attribute his strength to him secretly being a full-grown man who was held back. In actuality, Asahi is soft-hearted and timid, known for having a \\"glass heart\\". He sometimes struggles with low confidence and at one point, doubted his abilities so much that he left the team. Asahi is a strong spiker and is able to spike the ball from behind the line. Asahi is close friends with Daichi and Sugawara, and has a close relationship with Nishinoya, who encouraged him to return to the team. ;, #4 : :Played by: Shohei Hashimoto (2015‚Äì2017), Yuto Fuchino (2017‚Äì2018), Yuma Kitazawa (2019‚Äìpresent) :Nishinoya is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and the team's libero and defensive specialist. He is known as \\"Karasuno's Guardian Deity\\" due to his reliability for saving the ball and his high skill level. Along with Kageyama, he is considered one of Karasuno's two prodigies, having won the prefecture's \\"Best Libero\\" award in Junior High. Even shorter than Hinata, he is the smallest player on Karasuno. Nishinoya is loud, energetic and deeply passionate about his position, believing that he would choose to play libero even if he were born taller. He is considered the backbone of the team, as his specialization in receives and block recovery allow the team to keep scoring and continue the rally. Nishinoya is very proud of (but usually ridiculed for) his signature move, \\"Rolling Thunder\\", merely a rolling receive where he shouts \\"rolling thunder\\". He has a close relationship with Asahi, refusing to play unless the latter returned to his role as the team's ace. He is usually with Tanaka, both of whom adore team manager Shimizu Kiyoko. He enrolled at Karasuno because he thought that the girl's uniforms were cute and that the boy's all-black gakuran looked cool. ;, #5 : :Played by: Kouhei Shiota (2015‚Äì2018), Ko Kanegae (2019‚Äìpresent) :Tanaka is a second- year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker. He is loud, fierce and aggressive, but deeply respects his seniors and looks out for his juniors, wanting to be a good senior for them. Tanaka is a talented and versatile spiker and often gets digs that keep the rally going. When playing, he displays amazing mental fortitude, even when he is continuously targeted by the opposite team. Unfortunately, his aggressive behavior, volume, and delinquent-like appearance sometimes make a poor impression. Tanaka often tries to intimidate and pick fights with other teams, which Daichi or Sugawara must then break up. He is good friends with Nishinoya, and they both adore their team manager. ;, #6 : :Played by: Kazuma Kawahara (2015‚Äì2018), Yushin Nakatani (2019‚Äìpresent) :Ennoshita is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker. Despite his plain appearance, he is seen as the \\"leader\\" of the second-year students and possibly the only one able to control Nishinoya and Tanaka's antics apart from Daichi, as he is more mature and says things bluntly without remorse. In his first year, he was part of the \\"ungrateful second-years\\", a group of a few students who quit the team due to the pressure and extreme practice sessions of Coach Ukai Sr. Eventually, due to his love for volleyball, he returns to the team only to find Coach Ukai Sr. had retired again. Feeling guilty, Ennoshita sometimes feels that he does not deserve to be on the team and pushes himself during training to \\"earn back his spot\\". Though not a starting player, Ennoshita shows great potential for his leadership skills and his ability to motivate and keep the team in check. ;, #7 : :Played by: Sean Osada (2019‚Äìpresent) :Kinoshita is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a wing spiker. He, along with Ennoshita and Narita, was one of few students who left the club when Ukai Sr. came out of retirement to continue coaching. He later starts to specialize in the jump float serve. ;, #8 : :Narita is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and a middle blocker. He also left the volleyball team temporarily. He works well with Sugawara, practicing his combination attacks and regular attacks so that he can get a regular spot on the team. ; : :Played by: Shizune Nagao (2017‚Äì2018), Satomi Ohkubo (2019‚Äìpresent) :Shimizu is a third-year student and one of the managers of Karasuno's volleyball club. She was a former member of the track and field club before being recruited by Daichi in their first year to become the team manager. She rarely speaks and has an aloof and straightforward personality, but cares deeply about the team and its success; Shimizu was the one who found and washed the old banner and so it could be used to boost team morale during games. She is surprisingly shy, as seen when she attempts to provide words of encouragement to the team. Because she is in her final year of high school, she recruits Yachi and trains her to take over as manager, allowing her to open up and share her passion for her role. Due to her attractiveness, Karasuno is known as the team with \\"the attractive manager\\". She is often ogled by opponents and onlookers, as well as Nishinoya and Tanaka, who jealously guard her and offer to help her carry things. ; : :Played by: Ami Saito (2017-2018), Julie Yamamoto (2019-present) :Yachi is a first-year student and the assistant manager of Karasuno's volleyball club. She was recruited by Shimizu after the first Interhigh tournament to become assistant manager and to take over as manager when Shimizu graduates. Yachi is an excessively nervous, clumsy, and anxiety-ridden girl, and was very intimidated the first time Shimizu introduced her to the team. She hesitated joining as a manager after witnessing how passionate the team was about making it to Nationals, fearing it would be unfair of her to join if she didn't have the proper knowledge to help the team succeed. After talking to Hinata about her dilemma, she commits to joining and strives to learn as much as possible to help Karasuno succeed. Yachi is very kind and intelligent, easily making friends with Hinata and opening up to everyone else on the team. She is very studious and helps Hinata and Kageyama study for their tests. Yachi designs donation posters for the team with advice from her mother, who is a graphic designer. She admires Shimizu and often gets nervous in her presence, causing her to fluster and mix up her words. ; : :Played by: Shige Uchida (2015‚Äì2018), Kenta Kamakari (2019‚Äìpresent) :The Japanese literature teacher at Karasuno and the faculty advisor of the volleyball team. While he has no experience with volleyball, he takes notes about everything he learns and supports the team to the fullest. He has an enthusiastic and persistent personality, which impresses Nekoma's coach, getting him to agree to hold practice matches with the Karasuno team. When Karasuno did not have a coach at the beginning of the year, he pestered Keishin Ukai for weeks to become Karasuno's official coach. He often talks in difficult to understand metaphors, prompting him to become flustered and embarrassed when he realizes the team might not understand. ; : :Played by: Tsuyoshi Hayashi (2015‚Äì2018), Ken Ogasawara (2019‚Äìpresent) :A Karasuno volleyball team alumnus and the coach of the Karasuno volleyball team. He was originally a setter and is the grandson of the previous coach, the famed Ukai Sr. He helps out his mother at their family store, where the team often came after practice for snacks. Although he initially refused to be Karasuno's coach, he agreed to coach them for one practice match because Takeda mentioned it was against Nekoma, Karasuno's rival school. After witnessing the potential of Karasuno's new team, Ukai decides to continue as their official coach. He is also a member of the Karasuno Neighborhood Volleyball Association. As a high school setter, he did not become a regular until his third year because there were other setters being played in his first two years; as a result, he sympathizes with Sugawara, who was a regular until he was replaced by Kageyama in his third and final year. He cares deeply about the players and encourages their both their athletic and mental growth. :He was voiced by Kazunari Tanaka in seasons 1‚Äì3 until 10 October 2016 when Tanaka died from a brain stem hemorrhage. From episode 9 of season 3 onwards, he is voiced by Hisao Egawa. Rival schools: =Aoba Johsai High School:= Aoba Johsai High (ÈùíËëâÂüéË•øÈ´òÊ†°, Aoba J≈çsai K≈çk≈ç), also called Seijoh for short (ÈùíÂüé, Seij≈ç), is a private high school located in Miyagi Prefecture. It is a powerhouse school whose boy's volleyball team ranks in the top four in the prefecture. They are known for their strategic yet aggressive play style. According to Coach Ukai, they are a difficult matchup for Karasuno, calling them Karasuno's 'archenemy' within Miyagi. They are a powerful and balanced team whose individual players are noted to be strong enough to become the aces of any other team, had they not joined Aoba Johsai. Many of its players are graduates from Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. In recent years, Aoba Johsai has been consistently qualifying for the finals of both the Interhigh and Spring High, but are always defeated by Shiratorizawa. They are strengthened by their captain, T≈çru Oikawa, a talented setter able to draw out each player's full potential on the court. Their team colours are white and turquoise, and their banner says \\"Rule the Court\\". ;, : :Oikawa is a third-year student at Aoba Johsai High. He is the volleyball team's captain and starting setter, and is introduced as one of Haikyu!!'s first main antagonists. Known as one of the best setters in Miyagi Prefecture, he was previously Kageyama's senior when they both played for Kitagawa Daiichi, and as a result is dubbed \\"The Great King\\" by Hinata. Despite his popularity, flirtatious nature, and childishness, Oikawa is a hard worker and takes volleyball extremely seriously. He is well- balanced and especially well known for his powerful, accurate jump serves. He is extremely intelligent and cunning; his own teammates joke that they wouldn't want to be his friend because he figures out everyone's weaknesses. Despite his obvious talent, Oikawa is deeply insecure, feeling inferior to 'genius' players such as Kageyama (his junior) and blaming his own weakness for losing to Shiratorizawa; thus, he often overworks himself to compensate, even to the point of injury. His effectiveness as a setter comes from his dedication to learning the personal preferences of each individual player and setting the ball according to them, therefore making it easier to hit. Despite being exasperated by Oikawa's antics, the team deeply respects him, trusting him completely. He and the third years are especially close, all desperate to make it to Nationals before they graduate high school. He and Iwaizumi are childhood best friends and have played volleyball together for a long time. They are completely in sync with each other's thoughts, both on and off the court; Iwaizumi knows that despite his constant smiling, Oikawa's smiles are rarely genuine. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T≈çru) form \\"‰∏ÄÂæπ\\" meaning \\"obstinate\\" or \\"dauntless\\". ;, #2 : :Matsukawa is a third-year student and a middle blocker. He is cool-headed and often jokes around despite his serious looks, as seen when he calls out his ramen order to Oikawa while he serves (to remind him that if he didn't get it over, he had to treat the team to ramen). He shares a very close bond with the third years, especially Hanamaki, whom he is almost always with. The two are shown to be swapping jerseys on more than one occasion. Both enjoy spectating Oikawa's endless teasing directed towards Iwaizumi and watching Iwaizumi retaliate. He often chimes in with his own teasing remarks. ;, #3 : :Hanamaki is a third- year student and a wing spiker. He is a calm, observant and perceptive player, able to read the game situation quite well, and is usually quiet during games. Despite this, he does have a sense of humour, especially with the third years, and generally gets along pretty well with the other team members. He is seen flashing the peace sign when Oikawa compliments him. He shares a very close bond with the third years, especially Matsukawa, whom he trades jerseys with and is almost always with. ;, #4 : :Iwaizumi is a third year student at Aoba Johsai High. He is the team's ace and vice-captain. Iwaizumi is a stern but reliable teammate. He is a talented wing spiker known for his powerful spikes and on the spot plays with Oikawa, who nicknames him \\"Iwa-chan\\". He is mature, a good sport, and known for his physical strength. He acts supportively to all, including Kageyama, regardless of his history with Oikawa. He often resorts to violence with Oikawa whenever he teases or provokes him; however, Iwaizumi cares immensely for him and believes in his value as both a player and a person. He keeps Oikawa in check and prevents him from pertaining in unhealthy behaviours by stopping him from overworking himself, grounding him when he allows insecurity to get to his head, and calling him out for his childish antics. Because of his talent and firm-yet-caring attitude, he is looked up to as a leader and is highly respected on the team. He and Oikawa have been best friends since their childhood, having went to school together and playing volleyball together. When combined, Iwaizumi and Oikawa's first names (Hajime and T≈çru) form \\"‰∏ÄÂæπ\\" meaning \\"obstinate\\" or \\"dauntless\\". ;, #6 : :Yahaba is a second-year and a setter. He is a show off by nature. He doesn't like Kyotani, since he had stopped coming to practice, but was still chosen as a regular. He is the only person on the team who scolds Kyotani to his face for being a risky, selfish player and jeopardizing the third years' final chance of making it to Nationals. ;, #7 : :Watari is a second-year student and the team's libero. He seems to enjoy being challenged, as he smiled when Nishinoya copied his back row set. It is shown that he can be very gentle and supportive when he tries to cheer up Ky≈çtani after he misses a point, despite Ky≈çtani's poor relationship with the rest of the team. He was previously a setter, though it is unknown if he ever played as a setter for Aoba J≈çsai. ;, #12 : :Kindaichi is a first-year and a middle blocker. He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is called \\"Turnip Head\\" by Hinata and Tanaka. As a victim of Kageyama's previous aggressions, he and Kunimi were the ones who asked their coach to bench him. Though he claims to not care about what happened with Kageyama, it is evident that he feels guilty after seeing how Kageyama had mellowed out and even bonded with his new team in high school. Upon witnessing Kageyama's surprisingly healthy relationship with Karasuno, Kindaichi is left feeling somewhat defeated, which Kunimi chastises him for. He questions Hinata about Kageyama's welfare; to Kageyama himself, however, he merely reminds him that they are not (and never were) friends and states that there is \\"no one [he] wants to crush more than [him]\\". He is close friends with Kunimi, and he highly respects Iwaizumi and Oikawa, having known all three from Kitagawa Daiichi. ;, #13 : :Kunimi is a first-year and a wing spiker. He was Kageyama's former teammate at Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. He is also known as \\"Curtain Hair.\\" He has an indifferent and lazy personality and usually does not play using his utmost strength and energy, which Kageyama repeatedly scolded him for. In contrast, Oikawa permits and even praises him for his play-style, which allows him to conserve his energy for the later half of the game when everyone else is exhausted, giving him higher chances of scoring and making him a reliable player. He dislikes being told to \\"go all out\\" and occasionally skips practice. He is quiet and does not like loud, energetic people. Kageyama noted that he never smiled when they played together for Kitagawa Daiichi, but notices that Kunimi smiles and even celebrates during games in high school; this makes Kageyama feel inferior to Oikawa, who seemingly brings out the best in everyone. Kunimi is close friends with Kindaichi, whom he often slaps for feeling guilty about their history with Kageyama. ;, #16 : :Ky≈çtani is a second-year wing spiker, nicknamed \\"ky≈çken-chan\\" (\\"Mad Dog\\") by Oikawa, a play on the first part of his name and describing his unpredictable behaviour. He is described by Coach Ukai as a double edged sword because despite his powerful jumps, spikes, and speed, his play style is reckless, as he spikes the ball at 100% power every time without checking if he might be blocked first. He is aggressive and rarely speaks with his teammates, often barging into them and spiking sets that were not meant to be for him, and getting angry when he is used as a decoy, even when it is successful. He has no team work skills and with the exception of Iwaizumi, does not respect the third-years, which angers the first and second years. He stopped coming to practice but returned after the first tournament, thinking that the third years may have retired by then. Despite his rough personality, he is a strong player, and his middle school team is known to have been strong only during the years he played. He also has great body control, jump serves, and dexterity, being able to spike with either hand. Though he only listens to Iwaizumi, whom he challenged but lost to in various athletic contests, Oikawa is the only one who can actually put him to good use in the game. He mellows down slightly when Yahaba angrily reprimands him for being reckless and asks him to be a team player. =Nekoma High School:= is located in Nerima Ward of Tokyo. The word neko means 'cat' in Japanese, in line with their nickname \\"The Cats\\". They have a long running rivalry with Karasuno High School. Their coach, Yasufumi Nekomata, and Karasuno's coach, Ukai Sr., are good friends and want to make the \\"Battle of the Trash Heap\\" happen. Nekoma is known for its strong floor defense and receivers. They utilize strategies developed by Kenma, their quiet but intelligent setter known as the \\"brain\\" of the team. Nekoma's banner is red and says \\"Connect\\"; their uniforms are red and black. Their pre-game ritual is a speech by their captain Kuroo, who uses a metaphor to remind the team that they are like \\"blood\\", and must connect and continue flowing to circulate oxygen and keep their minds working. ;, #1 Rooster Head, Pain-in-the-ass Kuroo-san : :Played by: Shori Kondo (2016-present) :Kuroo is a third-year student at Nekoma. He is the captain of the volleyball club and a talented middle blocker known for his 'read blocks'. Kuroo is a playful and sly person, contrasting Kenma, Nekoma's setter and his childhood friend. He is nicknamed the 'scheming captain' because he is a clever strategist; he is also considered a 'provocation expert' because he enjoys teasing people lightheartedly. Despite his teasing, he is kind, and sportsmanship is important to him. During a training camp, he gives advice to Tsukishima about blocking. He invites him to practice with him in their free time, as he wants Karasuno to qualify for Nationals in order to fulfill Coach Nekomata's dreams. ;, #2 : :Kai is a third-year student at Nekoma High. He is the vice-captain and wing spiker for the volleyball team. He is a well-rounded player who is good at both spiking and receiving. Kai has a calm and pleasant disposition, and is good friends with Yaku and Kuroo. ;, #3 : :Yaku is a third-year student at Nekoma High and one of the team's liberos. He is known for being a very skilled libero, and is praised by both Nishinoya and Kageyama for his receiving skills. He acts like a mother hen to his teammates. He becomes hostile when someone (usually Lev) mentions how short he is, earning him the nickname \\"the demon senpai\\". ;, #4 : :Yamamoto is a second-year student at Nekoma High. He is a wing spiker and the ace of Nekoma's volleyball team. Like Tanaka, he has a tendency to lash out and provoke the other team, getting reprimanded by Yaku. He and Kenma would often have arguments, since he believes in putting in all his power and going all out, but Kenma doesn't like to spend his energy. He too is a fan of Shimizu, though he has poor luck with girls. ;, #5 : :Played by: Takato Nagata (2016-present) :Kenma is a second-year student at Nekoma High and the team's setter. He is introverted and prefers to keep to himself, choosing to play video games instead of interacting with others. Because he is so quiet, he does not stand out and is often overlooked by opponents. However, Kenma is vital to Nekoma's playmaking and is considered the 'backbone', 'brain', and 'heart' of the team, which Kuroo alludes to in his pre-game speech. He gets uncomfortable around people and as a result became very observant of others; thus, he is able to read opponents well and develop strategies to counter the opposite team, hence his nickname as the team's 'brain'. He is very close with Kuroo, his childhood friend who introduced him to the sport. He also became good friends with Hinata, whom he met by chance when Kenma got lost before their first official practice match, though Hinata was unaware that he was from Nekoma at the time. He and Hinata text often, revealing that despite their opposite personalities, they are still good friends. ;, #6 : :Fukunaga is a second-year student at Nekoma High and a wing spiker for the volleyball team. He has a very silent nature, and rarely speaks. ;, #7 : :Inuoka is a first-year at Nekoma High and a middle blocker. Like Hinata, he has an excitable and positive personality, and they get along well. He is the first player able to fully stop Hinata and Kageyama's freak quick. He is tall and often excited, genuinely praising Hinata for being able to adapt to their quicks getting blocked within one game. He becomes good friends with Hinata, even though they are technically rivals, and they often communicate using sound effects that no one else understands. ;, #11 : :Lev is a first-year at Nekoma High and a middle blocker. He is the tallest member on the team and is half-Japanese and half-Russian, though he only speaks Japanese. Lev has a happy-go-lucky and cheerful personality. He has no prior experience with volleyball and therefore was not present at Nekoma and Karasuno's first practice match. Like Hinata, he also aspires to be the ace of the team, though he is still working on practicing his fundamental skills. Kenma was tasked by their coach to 'take care of Lev', and thus the two often practice together in order to improve Lev's skills, though Kenma is unmotivated to do so at first. Lev reminds Kenma of Hinata due to their excitability, persistence, and poor essential skills such as receiving and serving. Lev also practices with Kuroo, who teaches him read-blocking skills. ;, #12 : :Shibayama is a first-year student at Nekoma High and is a libero. He deeply respects Yaku and but is unconfident in his own skills, so he feels pressured to be just as good when he plays. He is Nekoma's shortest player. =Date Tech High School:= , or Dateko for short, is located in Miyagi Prefecture. The team specializes in blocking and has the highest blocking rate in the prefecture, earning them the nickname \\"The Iron Wall\\". Their uniforms are white and teal, and their banner says \\"Date Tech's Iron Wall\\". They are known for their three person block and read blocking. ;, #2 : :Moniwa is a third year student at Dateko High. He is a setter and the captain of Dateko's volleyball team during the Interhigh. Until he retired, he had a hard time with the second years, since they would not listen to him, and he often needed help from other teammates to keep them in control. ;, #1 : :Kamasaki is a third year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He is loud, and often gets into arguments with Futakuchi, which ends in Moniwa asking Aone to stop both parties. He is talented blocker and is known as part of the Iron Wall. ;, #6 : :Futakuchi is a second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker. He becomes the captain once Moniwa retires, switching to #2. He and Kamasaki always argue and don't get along. He has a generally laid back attitude and caused trouble for his seniors before they retired. Once he becomes captain, he is especially reminded of how he used to give his seniors a hard time after taking care of their new energetic setter, Koganegawa. Futakuchi is usually seen with Aone in between matches and also at school, as they are in the same class. Futakuchi is one of the more notable players that make up the Iron Wall. He has a special enmity with Karasuno, since he wasn't able to stop the last score against them at their last match. ;, #7 : :Aone is a second year student at Dateko and a middle blocker. He is tall and has an intimidating appearance, but is actually very kind and soft spoken. He doesn't speak much, only talking when he really needs to. Before the match with Karasuno, he used to have a habit of pointing out the ace of the opposite team as soon as he met them, which scares Asahi. He establishes a bond with Hinata after the match against Karasuno, recognizing his ability of acting as an efficient decoy, even with his small body. He even feels offended on Hinata's behalf when Futakuchi calls Hinata useless without Kageyama, and later notes to Koganegawa that it is not always the tall and strong that are difficult to defeat. He is a talented read blocker and a notable part of the Iron Wall. ;, #12 : :Obara is second year student at Dateko and a wing spiker for the volleyball team. ;, #13 : :Sakunami is a first year student at Dateko and a libero for the volleyball team. He is in the same class as Koganegawa, and was tasked by their coach to \\"steer\\" him, due to his lack of technique. ;, #7 : :Koganegawa is a first year student at Dateko. Though he did not play at the Interhigh, he becomes the team setter after the third-years retired. His primary strength is his exceptional height. Despite this, he lacks technical skill and is new to being a setter, often setting at too high an angle or even accidentally setting the ball out of bounds. He has an extremely energetic personality and believes that a player should give everything they have in a game. He later befriends Hinata. He is a decent blocker due to his height, and is used as part of the team's blocking formation. =Fukurodani Academy:= is located in Tokyo. The 'fukuro' (Ê¢ü) in the school name means 'owl', which is also their official animal representative. Fukurodani is a powerhouse school that ranks in Tokyo's top 4 and has been to Nationals multiple times. They are an exceptionally strong all-around team led by their captain, Bokuto, one of the top 5 aces in Japan. They often hold training camps with other Kanto schools such as Nekoma, Ubugawa, and Shinzen; this group is called the Fukurodani Academy Group. Their team colours are black, white, and gold, and their team banner says \\"One ball, heart, and soul\\". ;, #4 : :Bokuto is a third year student at Fukurodani Academy. He is the captain and ace of its volleyball team. He is one of Japan's top 5 aces, only barely missing the top 3. Bokuto is enthusiastic and very passionate about volleyball. He is called 'simple-minded' by his teammates and is easily delighted by successful spikes and praise, especially from Akaashi, whom he often asks for (and gets) praise from. In spite of his apparent childishness, Bokuto takes volleyball seriously and is known even amongst players from other regions for his immense talent and in-game presence. He is especially well known for his cross-court shots and line shots, which are difficult to receive by opposing teams. However, Bokuto suffers from extreme mood swings that his team dubs his \\"emo mode\\", in which he is affected by small and trivial things in the middle of matches and is immediately put off his game. Despite the trouble he causes, the team, particularly Akaashi, is patient with him, and they work together to boost his morale (usually with some form of praise) in order to bring him back to his best. He is a social person who makes friends with other schools easily. During the training camp, Bokuto bonds with Hinata and teaches him various techniques, calling him his \\"star-pupil\\". He is friends with Kuroo, and practiced blocking with Tsukishima. Bokuto is usually with Akaashi whether it be during practice, between games, or at school. Takeda notes that Bokuto is a \\"weird\\" player who can lift the spirit of both his teammates and rivals, and is a player you want to cheer for regardless of the team you are rooting for. ;, #5 : :Akaashi is a second year student at Fukurodani Academy. He is the vice-captain and setter of the volleyball team. He is an intelligent, highly analytical player, usually running multiple scenarios and outcomes in his head before he decides what to do. He is polite and calm, often seen with an unexpressive or slightly stressed face, usually due to one of Bokuto's impending mood swings. Akaashi is very patient with Bokuto, and is the team's go-to person for handling his mood swings. He is perceptive and keeps track of how Bokuto is feeling during games to gauge whether or not his 'emo mode' will come out; when it does, Akaashi attempts to figure out what is bothering him and is able to get him back to normal, whether it be as simple as gesturing for the team to praise him or setting up plays that allow Bokuto to boost his own morale (for example, by hitting a good spike). His skills are well balanced and he is a talented setter, able to accurately and quickly set up successful plays for the team. He has a habit of playing with his hands absentmindedly. He claims to not completely understand how Bokuto works yet, despite having a mental list of at least 37 of Bokuto's weaknesses memorized. ;, #2 : :Washio is a third year student at Fukurodani Academy, and a middle blocker for the team. He is tall, stern and fairly quiet. Though he isn't as active as the rest of the team in making Bokuto feel better, he thoroughly supports and believes in him, and knows that he'll eventually be fine. ;, #3 : :Sarukui is a third year student at Fukurodani Academy and a wing spiker for the team. He is often nicknamed \\"Saru\\" by his teammates. He, Konoha, and Komi often help Akaashi fix Bokuto. ;, #7 : :Konoha is a third year student at Fukurodani Academy and a wing spiker for the team. Konoha is relatively easy- going and is a well-balanced player; he was once called a \\"jack of all trades, master of none\\" by a Fukurodani crowd member, much to his annoyance. During the training camp, Konoha notes that Karasuno is \\"sort of the hardest to play against\\" because of their unpredictability. He often helps Akaashi deal with Bokuto; however, unlike Akaashi, Konoha is willing to use more aggressive methods, such as kneeing him from behind and forcefully slapping his back. His aggression is a form of tough love, as he has complete faith in Bokuto, even telling Akaashi that he's allowed to ignore him because he will eventually come around. ;, #10 :Anahori is a first-year student at Fukurodani Academy and a setter for the team. ;, #11 : :Komi is a third-year student at Fukurodani Academy and a libero for the team. He is outgoing and energetic, and is Fukurodani's shortest member. He often tries to cheer Bokuto up when he loses motivation. ;, #12 : :Onaga is a first-year student at Fukurodani Academy and a middle blocker for the team. =Shiratorizawa Academy:= is a high school located in Sendai, the capital city of Miyagi Prefecture. The first two characters of its school name (ÁôΩÈ≥•) mean 'swan' in Japanese, but because its direct translation is 'white bird', they are often represented by white eagles. They were the undefeated champions in Miyagi prefecture and rank within Japan's top 8. Their play style centers around their \\"left cannon\\", their ace and captain Ushijima, who ranks within the top 3 high school aces in the country. According to Coach Ukai, Shiratorizawa power is more of an addition of each individual player's strength, since each player only plays to his own skills, contrasting Karasuno's 'multiplication' of player strengths. Shiratorizawa is notorious for its ruthless academic entrance exams, which are extremely difficult to pass. As a result, most of its players (excluding Shirabu) were individually chosen through sports scholarships. Their school colours are white and maroon, and their school banner is a Japanese idiom that roughly translates to \\"irresistible force\\". The school also has a middle school division, . ;, #1 : :Ushijima, sometimes nicknamed Ushiwaka, is a third year student at Shiratorizawa Academy. He is a wing spiker, and the captain and ace of its volleyball team. He has attended Shiratorizawa since Junior High. Ushijima is one of the top 3 aces in Japan, and was the only representative from T≈çhoku region selected to play for Japan's under-19 team in the Youth World Championships. He is known for his incredible power, as seen in his explosive jump serves and spikes, which are extremely difficult to receive and block. He is a left handed hitter, which causes difficulty to opposing teams by forcing them to adjust their blocks and receptions accordingly. He is a stoic, quiet and serious individual; he speaks candidly without sugarcoating his words, often causing others to interpret his words offensively. Despite his intimidating presence, Ushijima is completely unaware of social cues and customs; he interprets everything at face value, and is genuinely oblivious to his teammates' jokes or his opponent's challenges. Because Shiratorizawa method of play focuses on getting the ball to him, he is represented as a sole white eagle, contrasting Karasuno's multiple black crows. ;, #5 : :Tend≈ç is a third year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a middle blocker for the volleyball team. Nicknamed 'The Guess Monster', Tend≈ç is an exceptionally talented blocker who primarily uses 'guess blocking', which involves guessing which spiker the opposing team's setter will pass the ball to and where that spiker will hit the ball. He is highly intuitive and is consistently able to read his opponent's next move correctly, often basing the direction of his blocks on minimal hints or gut feeling. His guesses are said to be either '120% or 0%' effective. If he guesses correctly, he will undoubtedly block the ball; however, if he guesses wrong, there is no way he can stop it, as he will have blocked in the wrong direction. Tend≈ç is a cheerful and loud person, often teasing, nicknaming, and encouraging his teammates. He has a slightly sadistic streak, as he relishes in and enjoys watching opposing teams struggle when he blocks them. He is good friends with Ushijima. ;, #8 : :Goshiki is a first year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a wing spiker for the volleyball team. He is the up and coming ace of the team, with powerful straight and cross-court spikes. He looks up to his elders, especially Ushijima, although he constantly challenges Ushijima for the position of the top ace and tries to prove his worth to him. He is often described as simple-minded and easy to fire up, but is dependable. ;, #10 : :Shirabu is a second year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is the starting setter for the volleyball team. He, unlike the other Shiratorizawa players, did not receive a sports scholarship to Shiratorizawa and got in after passing the entrance exam. He decided to join Shiratorizawa in his third year of Junior High when he watched the match between Shiratorizawa Junior High division and Kitagawa Daichi, because based on Shiratorizawa playstyle, the pressure of winning relied on their ace (Ushijima), not the setter. Shirabu is a calm and calculating setter, solely focused on getting the ball to Ushijima at all costs. He is easily irritated. ;, #4 : :≈åhira is a third year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a wing spiker for the volleyball team. He is dependable at both receiving and spiking. ;, #3 Semi Semi : :Semi is a third year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a setter for the volleyball team. He was originally the starting setter for Shiratorizawa. He is a highly skilled player with a quiet desire to showcase his skills when he plays; however, he was replaced by Shirabu because his play style was riskier, whereas Shirabu only focuses on sending the ball to Ushijima. After being replaced, Semi is used as a pinch server, as his serves are both powerful and effective. Because the pinch server acts alone, he is free to show off his talent, which he wouldn't have been able to do so as a setter. ;, #14 : :Yamagata is a third year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a libero for the volleyball team. ;, #12 : :Kawanishi is a second year student at Shiratorizawa Academy, and is a middle blocker for the volleyball team. He was able to stop Karasuno's synchronized attack. It is also shown that he and Shirabu are close friends. =Inarizaki High School:= is a high school located in the Hy≈çgo Prefecture of Kansai region. The inari (Á®≤Ëç∑) in the school name uses the same kanji as Inari ≈åkami, the Shinto deity of foxes; thus, they are often represented with foxes and torii. The team is highly popular and fan favorites for winning Nationals, and are supported by their strong lineup, particularly the Miya twins, Miya Atsumu and Miya Osamu. Inarizaki has a large marching band, orchestra, and cheer team at their games. They have a passionate fanbase known for booing at opposing teams. Their uniforms are black and white, and their school banner says \\"we don't need the memories\\", alluding to their highly competitive nature. ;, #1 : :Kita is a third year in Inarizaki High School. He is wing spiker and the captain in its volleyball team. ;, #2 : : ≈åmimi is a third year in Inarizaki High School, and is middle blocker for the volleyball team. ;, #4 : : Ojiro is a third year in Inarizaki High School. He is chicken wing and ice emon tea for the volleyball team. ;, #5 : : Ginjima is a second year in Inarizaki High School, and is wing spiker for the volleyball team. ;, #7 : : Miya is a second year in Inarizaki High School, and is setter for the volleyball team. He is the twin brother of Osamu Miya. ;, #10 : : Suna is a second year in Inarizaki High School, and is middle blocker for the volleyball team. ;, #11 Myaa-sam : : Osamu is a second year in Inarizaki High School, and is wing spiker for the volleyball team.

Their ace, Kiyoomi Sakusa, is one of the top 3 in Japan, and their libero, Motoya Komori, is the number one high school libero in Japan. Their uniforms are bright yellow, green, and white. ;, #1 :Tsukasa is a third year in Itachiyama Institute.

He studied at the Tbilisi State Art Academy from 1976 to 1982 from which he graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts degree. Since 1982 he has been working as an independent, professional artist and participated in numerous solo- and group exhibitions in galleries and museums. He has worked in a variety of media: painting, installations, object and video art. From 1985 until 1988 Lazar lived and worked in Moscow, Russia. He then moved on to Paris, France. The following year, 1989, Lazar spent in Kassel, Germany as an artist-in-residence with the Museum Fridericianum. From 1990 until 2003 Lazar lived and worked in Cologne, Germany. During his time in Germany, sweeping changes were taking place in his native region that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the declaration of independence of Georgia and was followed by armed conflicts and civil war in his country of origin. As Lazar was unable to return, he stayed on in Germany, where he eventually received citizenship. From 1997 until 2005 he held a position as lecturer at the European Academy of Fine Arts in Trier, Germany. In 2003 Lazar relocated to New York City, United States, where he has continued his artistic career. Studio view: Luca Lazar and works from series \\"Moving Stills\\" By the late 1990s Lazar started to concentrate mainly on geometrical art, which was followed by minimal abstract explorations, resulting in a series titled \\"The White Curtain\\" and a series titled \\"One- liners\\". From this point onward Lazar started to develop his own signature style, based on minimal abstract art, geometric art, optical art and containing important undertones of expressionist art, which resulted in works that are unlike any existing art direction or style. These works provide a sensation of continuous flowing movement in space, hence their title \\"Moving Stills\\" The underlying principle of the works of \\"Moving Stills\\" has been described as: ‚Äúcontrolled energy, raw powers created through and at the same time restricted by spatial structures and the arrangement of interlocking lines. Using a reduced vocabulary of minimalist forms, the untitled individual works in this series provide the suggestion of energetic movement within a motionless, frozen setting. The works are not informed by any kind of anticipation of what the viewer may or may not see in them, but rather are to be understood by making the actual attempt of leaving the ways of perception behind that we are so accustomed to, in order to be ‚Äúfelt‚Äù quite intuitively in an act of self-communication.‚Äù (source Marcel Krenz, art critic, in Catalogue ‚ÄúLuca Lazar: Moving Stills‚Äù Gallery Sch√ºppenhauer K√∂ln, ) Select Exhibitions 2012 ‚ÄúGeorgian artists of the 80s and 90s‚Äù, The National Museum, Tbilisi, Georgia 2011 ‚ÄúFestinova‚Äù ‚Äì Art festival, Georgian Art Centre ‚ÄúGarikula‚Äù, Georgia\\"Georgian Artists working in Europe\\", as part of European days events ‚ÄìTbilisi, Georgia 2010 ‚ÄúART MOSCOW‚Äù- Moscow ‚ÄúCOINCIDENCE‚Äù -

Tobacco was brought into the complex, which originally had fourteen warehouses, by rail, and was delivered to local processing plants by truck.

He has lent a multidisciplinary approach to the writing and publication of numerous articles discussing a wide range of musical topics and ideas. Blum's writing displays a strong knowledge of parallel disciplines through the thoughtful inclusion of academic theory from the fields of sociology, historical musicology, philosophy, anthropology, composition and analysis. Through his continued participation and critiques, he has made numerous contributions to the dialogue surrounding the fields of ethnomusicology and musicology. Biography Blum received a bachelor's degree from Oberlin College in 1964,and then a PhD in music at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. As a PhD student, Blum worked with music scholars including Alexander Ringer, Charles Hamm, and Bruno Nettl. His first publications were co-authored with Nettl, a pioneering historical musicologist and ethnomusicologist,, Retrieved February 11, 2014 and supervising his dissertation, Musics in Contact: The Cultivation of Oral Repertoires in Meshed Iran, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, 1972. Blum was to later co- edit the 1991 festschrift for Nettl, Ethnomusicology and Modern Music History, along with former Nettl students Philip Bohlman and Daniel M. Neuman. Academic appointments Blum‚Äôs teaching career began at Western Illinois University (1967‚Äì73), followed by an assistant professorship at University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign until 1977. He then moved to Toronto's York University, where he remained for ten years, founding the MFA program \\"Music and Contemporary Cultures\\", the first of its kind Canada. In 1987 he founded the ethnomusicology program at City College of New York Graduate Center, where he worked until his retirement in 2016.  Scholarship and legacy  Blum's ethnographic focus on northeastern Iran in his PhD dissertation led to a number of published articles early in his career discussing the folksinging traditions of these regions. His final observations were not just theoretical, but took into consideration the racial and classist attitudes among his informants, the implications of which are included in his ethnographic work. In \\"The Concept of the ‚ÄòAsheq in Northern Khorasan\\" (1972) Blum presents part of his fieldwork undertaken in 1969 for his dissertation but pointedly focuses on social folk music of the (primarily) Kurdish minority. In 1974, his article, \\"Persian Folksong in Meshhed (Iran)\\", Blum continued a detailed rhythmic and melodic analysis of ten folk songs while focusing on informant- perceived rural and urban difference in style and performance. He observed that a lack of singing and dancing in Iranian society is not linked to a rural and urban divide but is a privation of poverty. He noted, With Ameneh Youssefzadeh, Blum is the consulting editor in music for Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. He is also the author of a number of entries in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and has contributed to the three volumes of the Garland Encyclopedia of World Music devoted to the United States and Canada, the Middle East, and Europe. Blum often returned to his Western roots, a prominent example being an article on the writing and music of Charles Ives published in 1977 in The Musical Quarterly. He discusses and analyzes Ives‚Äô music through his writing, tackling the motivations and perceptions of a stubborn and controversial artist, concluding that Ives‚Äô \\"musical techniques aimed to explore 'processes of musical differentiation' in relationships of sounds, with reference to their social and moral contexts.\\" He has often tackled theoretical issues in musicology, ethnomusicology. The field recordings from his research trips to Iran were donated to Harvard University, where they have been digitized and posted publicly online as the Stephen Blum Collection of Music from Iranian KhorƒÅsƒÅn. In 1995, Blum donated copies of this collection to Iran's Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance.

James is a close friend of San Francisco Giants pitcher Barry Zito, and the two have shared the stage to perform together for Zito's Strikeouts for Troops charity.  Biography  James was born in Los Altos, California and grew up in the Bay Area. He started playing music at the age of 12 after receiving his first guitar. James credits his childhood experiences in the Bay area as a strong musical influence due to the wide range of music to which he was exposed. His early interest in music was sparked by grunge artists like Nirvana, Sound Garden, and Pearl Jam, and his own music was inspired by singer-songwriter acts like Sublime, Ben Harper, Jason Mraz, and the Dave Matthews Band. California hip-hop served as inspiration that later led James to integrate freestyle rapping into music. James remains an independent artist and has financed his tours through sponsorship deals with brands like Oakley, Muscle Milk, Corona, and Honda.

Brown (February 28, 1937 ‚Äì April 20, 2014) was an American politician who served in the Maryland House of Delegates and was the Secretary of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Background Brown was born in Chicago, Illinois and graduated from the University of Chicago High School. He earned a B.A. degree at Wheaton College in 1957 and then came to Baltimore to go to medical school. Brown received his medical degree from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1961. After completing his residency in internal medicine, Brown joined the Hopkins faculty. He was promoted to assistant dean of the School of Medicine and later rose to become the vice president of Johns Hopkins Hospital. He also served with the U.S. Public Health Service from 1963 to 1965. In the Legislature Brown was first elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1971 and represented Legislative District 39, in Baltimore City, until 1983. He was a member of the Environmental Matters Committee and became its chairman in 1979. In his first year in the legislature, one of his colleagues, Delegate Russell O. Hickman, suffered a heart attack during a debate. Brown and fellow physician Dr. Aris T. Allen, a state senator from Annapolis, were credited with saving his life. As Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources In 1982, after redistricting, Brown ran for re-election to the Maryland House of Delegates, but this time in the newly created 44th legislative district. He was pitted against three other incumbents: Delegates Dennis C. McCoy, Frank Robey and Anne Scarlett Perkins as well as several newcomers including former television news anchor Curt Anderson. Although three seats were up for election, Brown finished fourth behind Anderson, McCoy and Perkins. He was, however, appointed by Governor Harry Hughes to be the new Secretary of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and assumed that post in 1983. As Secretary, Brown proved to be a formidable advocate for saving Maryland's natural resources. In 1984 Brown issued a moratorium that saved the dwindling Maryland rockfish population. He championed Program Open Space, which preserved thousand of acres of Maryland land and wildlife. Maryland hatched more bald eagles in the next 20 years (about 1,800) than existed 20 years ago in the whole lower 48 states. Brown also spearheaded Ocean City beach replenishment working with local property owners. Brown served as chairman of the Power Plant Research Advisory Committee and a vocal member of the Chesapeake Bay Trust. As CEO In 1998 Brown returned to his roots as a researcher. He co-founded a biotech firm called Intralytix Inc. He directed the company's effort to find useful applications for Bacteriophages or \\"phages\\". A phage is a virus that infects and devours bacteria. With more bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics, Brown felt that the use of bacteria's naturally occurring enemy would ultimately surpass the use of lab-invented antibiotics which over time become ineffective in their original doses. Brown wanted to adopt existing knowledge about phage therapies and use them in the United States. Death Brown died of heart disease on April 20, 2014, at the age of 77. Legacy On the day of his death, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley ordered Maryland flags be flown at half-staff. A hiking trail, the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail, that extends from Maryland into Pennsylvania, is named in his honor. In 2008, Brown received the Woodrow Wilson Award, an award given to Hopkins' alumni for distinguished public service, from the Johns Hopkins University alumni association.

Lenk was the founder of the Youth League of the Nazi Party, the predecessor of the Hitler Youth. Early life Lenk was a trained piano polisher. On September 12, 1920, Lenk and his father attended a National-Socialist party meeting in Munich where Adolf Hitler gave a speech. He was captivated, but could not join the party at the time because he was younger than 18 years old. Lenk requested if he could start a youth organization that would be associated with the NSDAP, and the idea appealed to many and was allowed to be created. When Hitler, then chairman of the party, in a speech in December 1921 casually mentioned a possible youth organization, Lenk, now member of the party, came back to his idea. In March 1922 published in the party's newspaper was on Hitler's initiative V√∂lkischer Beobachter. The founding meeting of the Youth League on 13 May 1922 in B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller, Munich, Lenk began as a youth leader together with Adolf Hitler as a speaker. Initially limited to Munich, in 1922 more local groups were still being founded in Bavaria and central Germany and published their own newspapers. German Youth Movement After the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923, the Youth League was banned in Germany just like the party, but was continued by Lenk under the name of the Patriotic Youth Association of Greater Germany. The Patriotic Youth Association of Greater Germany was then disbanded by officials because they believed that it was just a new name for the Nazi Youth League. Lenk was then imprisoned, and when he was released, he founded another group, the Greater German Youth Movement. He was then arrested again and sent to Landsberg Prison, where he was released in December 1924. Lenk was released from prison at a similar time as Hitler, and shortly after Hitler's release, Hitler re-founded the Nazi Party. Lenk was hesitant of Hitler because he had declared himself undisputed leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, so he founded a new nationalist youth organization which was not affiliated with Hitler. In response, the Party spread rumors saying that Lenk was a traitor and a petty thief. This led to Lenk's downfall out of German youth movements. Kurt Gruber served as Lenk's successor as the youth organization's leader. After the establishment of the Hitler Youth in 1926, the party no longer recognized Lenk's organization as a precursor. After the Youth Movement In March 1932, Lenk met again at the party and became active in the SA. In 1941, working now in the SA national leadership in Berlin was expelled from the party because he had improperly taken the \\"Blood Order\\". A new membership application was unsuccessful. Death The only known fact about Lenk's death is his death occurred sometime in 1987.

It is owned and operated by Phil Ruffin. The venue is located at the north end of the Strip, north of Circus Circus Las Vegas. It is and has a capacity of 85,000 people. History From 1941 to the 1970s, the El Rancho Vegas occupied most of the land. In 2007, MGM Mirage (later MGM Resorts International) purchased the El Rancho site from Gordon Gaming for $444 million. In 2014, MGM announced plans to develop the site as an outdoor music venue in partnership with Cirque du Soleil and Ron Burkle's Yucaipa Companies. The project was primarily designed to serve as the site of Rock in Rio USA, a new biennial music festival. The venue was initially referred to as the City of Rock, named after its equivalent in Rio de Janeiro, the site of the original Brazilian version of the Rock in Rio festival. The name was soon changed to the MGM Resorts Festival Grounds. MGM hoped to position the grounds as a site for festivals, concerts, and sporting events (such as boxing, mixed martial arts, and soccer) as a complement to its other venues in the area. The festival grounds made its debut in May 2015 with the Rock in Rio USA festival. Development costs for the site totaled $20 million. In October 2015, the MGM Resorts branding was dropped and the site was renamed to simply Las Vegas Festival Grounds. The renaming was part of an effort to downplay MGM's role in the venue to improve its marketability for third-party events and to brand the site as being part of Las Vegas's \\"community\\". MGM sold the property to Phil Ruffin, along with the neighboring Circus Circus hotel and casino, in 2019. Events The Rock in Rio USA music festival was held at the venue in May 2015, headlined by No Doubt, Metallica, Taylor Swift, and Bruno Mars. The festival was intended to be held biennially, but after disappointing ticket sales, plans for future editions of the event were quietly shelved. In April 2016, the Las Vegas Festival Grounds hosted the ACM Party For a Cause Festival on the weekend preceding the Academy of Country Music Awards. In 2018, the iHeartRadio Music Festival relocated its Daytime Village stage to the Las Vegas Festival Grounds, moving from the Las Vegas Village. On November 1‚Äì3, 2019, the Festival Grounds held a music festival called Day N Vegas, which featured performances from rap and hip-hop artists. Major headliners included J. Cole, Migos, Tyler, The Creator and Kendrick Lamar. The festival was organized by Goldenvoice, known for organizing the Coachella Festival. The following month, it hosted the inaugural Intersect Music Festival, organized and sponsored by Amazon Web Services. Due to construction of expansions to the Circus Circus property, the 2020 Conexpo-Con/Agg moved its heavy equipment exhibition from the property's \\"gold lot\\" to the Festival Grounds.

The new Associate Justice was assigned to Arizona Territory's first district, comprising Cochise, Graham, and Pima counties. Barnes moved to Tucson where he lived for the rest of his life. Senate confirmation of his appointment came on May 28, 1886. A number of his decisions survive from Barnes' time on the bench. While dealing with tax matters, Bares ruled in Atlantic & Pacific Railroad Company v. Leseur (1888), 2 Arizona 428 that the power to tax that was given to the territory by the federal government was to be liberally construed and that for property to be exempt from said taxation it required a specific exemption. He reiterated this ruling in Territory of Arizona v. Delinquent Tax List (1889), 3 Arizona 177, adding that the territory's district courts did not have the authority to determine if tax rates were excessive, but could only intervene judicially in cases of fraud. Dealing with property rights, Barnes rules in Stiles v. Lord (1886), 2 Arizona 154, that an 1871 statute granting control of separately owned property to married women did not grant rights beyond those specified by the law. He added additional detail to this ruling in Woffenden v. Charouleau (1886), 2 Arizona 91 when he determined the law applied to legal rulings dating back to 1876 under the principle of stare decisis. Barnes dealt with several procedural issue as a judge. In Johnson v. Tully (1887), 2 Arizona 223, he ruled that because the plaintiff had agreed to a settlement of $4,304.93 in a suit before the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court, he had given up the option of further appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States which required a minimum contested sum of $5,000 in any appealed dispute. In Bryan v. Pinney (1888), 2 Arizona 390, Barnes ruled that adjourned terms of the territorial supreme court were not continuations of the previous term but were instead separate and distinct sessions. Finally, Barnes wrote in Insane Asylum v. Wolfley (1889), 3 Arizona 132, which dealt with a writ of mandamus that \\"The court ought not to issue the writ unless it is prepared to enforce (it).\\" One of the final issues Barnes dealt with from the bench was the Wham Paymaster Robbery. A call for the judge's removal was sent to the Department of Justice after he reduced the defendant's bail from $15,000 to $10,000. This was followed by a dispute developing between Barnes and the grand jury investigating the case. The dispute resulted in a telegram being sent by the jury foreman to the Attorney General claiming that Barnes was exerting inappropriate influence upon government witnesses. Upon learning of the telegram, Judge Barnes dismissed the Grand Jury, calling them \\"a band of character assassins, unworthy to sit in any court of justice.\\" The grand jury's telegram did not factor into the official reason for Barnes' removal. The Department of Justice instead cited the fact that Barnes had accepted $900/year in pay from the territorial treasury on top of the $3000/year salary offered by the Federal government. The practice of the territory offering extra pay to judges assigned to the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court had begun in 1875 but the Federal government still felt it was illegal for the judges to accept the extra salary. On October 17, 1889, a couple weeks after the telegram was sent, President Benjamin Harrison nominated Richard Elihu Sloan as Barnes' replacement. Later life After leaving the bench, Barnes returned to private legal practice. Toward this end he joined with John H. Martin to form the firm of Barnes & Martin. In 1893, Charles Crocker hired the firm to represent the Southern Pacific Railroad. Another major client was William C. Greene and the Greene Consolidated Copper Company. Barnes' other business interests included the Cieneguita Copper Company, of which he became president. In 1895, Barnes became the second president of the Arizona Bar Association, a position he held for two years. After the 16th Arizona Territorial Legislature authorized a constitutional convention in 1891, Barnes was selected as one of 22 delegates. The next year he represented Arizona Territory at the 1892 Democratic National Convention. In November 1894, Barnes became a special assistant United States Attorney for Arizona. A supporter of the Democratic party most of his life, Barnes altered his political support to endorse Republican Teddy Roosevelt in September 1904. Barnes died in his home around 9:00 pm on November 10, 1904 after becoming suddenly ill. He was buried in Tucson's Evergreen Cemetery.

History An Ajnad al- Sham Islamic Union fighter during the Siege of Darayya and Muadamiyat, 20 June 2015 In early November 2013, a large number of Sunni Islamist rebel groups in the wider Damascus region announced the formation of the ‚ÄúGreater Damascus Operations Room‚Äù, excluding Jaysh al-Islam and the most radical jihadis al- Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Later that month, five of the larger and most locally well-established groups within in the Operations Room‚Äîthe Habib al-Mustafa Brigades and Battalions, the Amjad al- Islam Gathering, the Sahaba Brigades and Battalions, the Youth of Huda Battalions and the Shield of the Capital Brigade‚Äîdeclared the creation of the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union. Abu Muhammad al-Fatah, commander of the Youth of Huda Battalions, was appointed as leader of the formation. The group was initially allied with Jaysh al-Islam‚Äîthe largest rebel group in eastern Ghouta‚Äîwith Islamic Union leader Abu Muhammad al-Fatah being the deputy of Jaysh al-Islam leader Zahran Alloush in the Unified Military Command of Eastern Ghouta. The two groups subsequently came into conflict control of smuggling tunnels in 2015. Jaysh al-Islam attacked the Islamic Union's headquarters several times between 2015 and early 2016. As a result, Ajnad al- Sham Islamic Union fighters based in eastern Ghouta, including the entire Habib al-Mustafa Brigades and Battalions, announced their \\"full incorporation\\" into the al-Rahman Legion, though reiterating that its fighters based in the western Damascus suburbs of Darayya and Muadamiyat as well as in southern Damascus would still operate under the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union banner and were not a part of this merger. The Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union fighters who joined the Rahman Legion were barred from leadership positions and their weapons were seized and redistributed among other Legion members. On 26 February 2016, Syrian Army Special Forces killed the second leader of the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union, Faysal al-Shami (\\"Abu Malek\\"), after intense clashes in the Darayya Association Quarter. On 19 March 2017, Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union fighters who left Darayya and Muadamiyat between August and October 2016 as part of the evacuation deal to Idlib joined the Sham Legion, reducing the presence of the Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union to two pockets in the Damascus and Rif Damascus areas. After the completion of the Beit Jinn offensive in January 2018 and the Southern Damascus offensive the following month, Ajnad al-Sham Islamic Union presence was further reduced to a single pocket in the southern outskirt of Damascus. In May 2018, the remaining members evacuated to Idlib. Following the evacuation, the groups ceased to be active.

Citation: \\"On the occasion of a bad accident that occurred on board H.M.S. Hood at Portsmouth on the 15th February, 1930, when Dockyard workmen were engaged in opening up for inspection the starboard after bulge compartments, a Shipwright named Langford entered through the manhole into a compartment contaminated with carbon monoxide and was overcome and collapsed. He was alive when brought out but died without recovering consciousness. As soon as the alarm was given a rescue party entered the bulge, but found great difficulty in locating Langford owing to the very bad atmosphere and the absence of effective lighting. The party had gas-masks but these were ineffective against carbon monoxide gas. Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, Able Seaman Harrison made his way through successive compartments and at great personal risk, continued his search and, with assistance, eventually brought Langford out. On being brought out, Harrison himself was in a state of collapse.\\" ;For Meritorious Service *Lance Corporal Lawrence Edward Cromey, 2nd Battalion, The Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment. *Staff Sergeant Cecil Lockyer, Royal Army Ordnance Corps. *Flight Sergeant Edward Victor Hibberd, Royal Air Force. ;Civil Division ;For Meritorious Service *Henry Creed, Office Keeper in the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office. *Thomas Greensmith, Inspector of Shipping, H.M.
